its story is told by an @entity10 , @entity9 , therapist named @entity11 and centers around one of her clients , @entity15 _ _ _ , a man whose name we never learn and who , more importantly , has an unusual talent			2
thanks to a suit and some cream he helped develop , @entity15 _ _ _ can basically render himself invisible to the untrained eye			1
but more than simply a book about a guy with a special ability , " the @entity4 " is about how people act when they 're not being watched , and the sketchy moral line that 's crossed by the watcher			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity2 about the inspiration for the book , writing about and participating in the interview process , and how no one is going to relate to the two main characters in his new novel			1
@entity0 : what was the inspiration for " @entity40 " ? @entity2 : i think it was probably when i was writing the previous book , the essay collection ( 2009 's " @entity45 " )			1
i had to reread @entity48 ' " @entity47 " for an essay i was writing			2
i was living in @entity49 at the time , teaching for the @entity50 , so i got it through @entity52 or whatever , and it was an edition of the book that was " @entity47 " and " @entity55			1
" so i decided i would read " @entity55 " too , since i had n't read it since fifth or sixth grade			1
it was a totally different book than i 'd remembered ( which is what happens when ) you 're an adult			1
the thing that was most interesting to me was that the invisible man was such a jerk			1
he was just this kind of egocentric , weird person			2
of course , as i thought it over , what type of personality would pursue something like invisibility ? it would have to be someone who was both very smart and really sort of egocentric -- would lack the normal boundaries a person would have			2
at the same time , i was thinking a lot about the process of interviewing			2
sort of the unreality of being interviewed			0
i started to wonder , if you really want to understand what someone 's like , how would you do it ? interviewing or surveying or anything when a person is around other people is so impacted by the experience			0
so those two things together sort of ended up becoming this book			1
@entity0 : you like to talk about interviewing while being interviewed			0
having written this book , which includes a lot of interview - based conversation , was your position on interviewing altered ? @entity2 : no. the more you profile people and the more you try to learn things from people through asking them questions , the shortcoming and failures of this process become more and more present in your mind			1
i ca n't imagine that , as i grow older , i 'm going to reverse my thinking and start believing the interviewing process is more valuable than i think now			0
it will probably just keep eroding			0
but here 's the trick , or , i guess , the paradox : even though interviewing is this incredibly flawed process , it 's still the best means we have for understanding people we do n't know			0
it 's completely imperfect , but still better than every other option			0
@entity0 : do you think your opinion of interviewing will erode to the point where you no longer interview people or get interviewed ? @entity2 : what else would i do ? i mean , i 'm a journalist			1
there 's certainly a thinking , and i did n't see this as much when i worked in newspapers , but when i moved to @entity131 and ended up being surrounded mostly by critics , i came to the realization that a lot of people sort of work under the impression that not only is interviewing not helpful , but that it 's mostly detrimental			0
that if you want to write about the band @entity141 , it 's a disadvantage to meet @entity142 , because that 's going to warp your real perception of the music			0
you 're going to hear his music through these things you learned in the interview			0
maybe he charms you , maybe you see something in him , maybe you do n't like him			0
i understand that , and i think that 's why a lot of pretty smart writers , as they age , do tend to do less reporting			0
i do n't know that that 'll ever happen to me			0
@entity0 : one of the two main characters in the book , and the one who tells the book 's story , @entity167 , admits on page 1 , " i am not a writer			1
" did writing in this person 's voice allow you to free yourself of writerly conventions , or was there a pressure to authentically write in an unwriterly fashion ? @entity2 : to me , that was totally a decision based around verisimilitude , i guess is the word ? to me , if someone had never written a book before and was now attempting to write a book based on the fact that they had one metaphysical encounter , that would be their fear			1
that 's one of the weird things about this book			1
there are two primary characters , obviously , and the one character , because he 's this psychopathic scientist , he is this kind of unlikable , egocentric person			1
but what kind of therapist would allow themselves to almost become ( involved with ) this person ? well , it would be someone who is insecure , and someone who is just smart enough to be kind of dumb			0
as a product , neither one of these two characters are very relatable to people			0
i ca n't imagine someone reading this and going , " i really relate to this man or this woman			0
" but that 's just how it goes			0
@entity0 : there 's a battle between actual sense of self and pop - culture - produced sense of self in this book , especially with regards to reality television			2
do you worry that pop culture is taking too strong of a hold on our daily lives ? @entity2 : the short answer is yes			1
the long answer is that it 's an extremely complicated question which often collides with this classic problem of , " is this idea bad or is it just new ? " i 'm just thinking about it constantly			2
in probably all of my books , except maybe the very first one , but even that one probably , is this idea of , " what is reality ? " i mean , it 's kind of a cliche thing ; it seems like something you worry about when you 're 17 , but i 've never stopped worrying about it			0
it 's the main thing i think about in my life			2
( laughs ) @entity0 : does writing about a guy like the one in this book help , or does it confuse the issue ? @entity2 : both			1
you start with a core problem , and maybe you answer that question to what you 've decided is an acceptable degree , but of course , that just creates a new question			0
if you think about reality , and you think about the problems of reality , there 's never going to be a point where there 's no more questions to ask			0
the questions just get harder and less clear			0
but at the same time , if you keep going on that , eventually you end up writing a book where the whole premise is , " this book exists			2
" like , " am i really writing a book ? " is sort of a zero - sum game			2
@entity0 : in describing the book , are you hung up on the semantics of invisibility , like its main characters ? if someone says , " ' the @entity4 ' is about a man who becomes invisible , " does that bother you ? @entity2 : well , it 's a very good question , i guess , would it bother me			1
if somebody asked me , " what is this book about ? " and i know that i only have one sentence to tell them , i would say , " well , it 's how it would be to be the invisible man 's therapist			1
" but if i read a review that said that and simplified it down , i would be like , " that 's totally wrong ! " it might bother me if someone else said it , but it does n't bother me when i think it			0
the simple fact is that people ca n't be invisible			2
i think that , in general , when i write nonfiction , i want it to seem like hyperreality , for it to feel like you 're reading fiction			1
but when i write fiction , i want it to seem like journalism .			1

@entity2 says he was partially inspired by the classic " @entity55 "
the main character in the book can render himself invisible
the author says he wants his fiction to feel like journalism
