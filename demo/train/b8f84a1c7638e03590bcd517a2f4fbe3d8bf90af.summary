-- when president @entity2 stands in front of @entity4 tuesday for the @entity5 , he will likely talk about his new focus : " income inequality			1
" but why , five years into the @entity2 administration , does the president and his political advisers want to change the topic and focus on this new theme ? well , probably because @entity2 does not want to talk about job creation			1
in 2009 the president promised that if the @entity16 people took on another $ 800 billion in higher debt and spent that $ 800 billion through the government , it would " create or save " 3.5 million jobs over the next two years and unemployment -- then 7.3 % -- would not go higher than 8 % ( it ended up peaking at 10 % )			2
after all that spending , the @entity16 had the weakest recovery since @entity24 the percentage of @entity16 of working age who are actually working was 66 % when the recession began , stood at 65.8 % when @entity2 was inaugurated and actually fell to 62.8 % today			1
the only reason the unemployment number has appeared to fall from 7.3 % since @entity2 took office to 6.7 % now is that 10 million @entity16 of working age have left the workforce out of frustration at not finding work			1
so creating jobs would be a rather unpleasant topic for the president			1
and @entity16 has just marked the 50 - year milestone in the " @entity39 , " announced by president @entity40 in 1964			2
after $ 15 trillion in government spending , poverty remains as high as when the war was declared			0
the wars in @entity45 and @entity46 have been shorter and less expensive in dollars			0
so " income inequality " is a much less unpleasant topic than " why government spending did not create permanent jobs " or " why massive welfare spending did n't fix poverty			1
" before @entity2 promised we could keep our doctors and health care if we wanted -- which he now admits was a fib -- the @entity57 promised that government spending would create real jobs and welfare would end poverty			2
one might have noticed @entity62 as a storm petrel or dead canary in the coal mine			0
but rather than learn from 50 years and five years of failure , president @entity2 wants to change the subject			1
governments can reduce income inequality			1
you simply weaken the middle class and tax or regulate or inflate away the earnings of the highest - paid @entity16 and , without making any single person or family or community better off , you have reduced income inequality			1
the grinding poverty of the @entity80 had great income equality			2
even the kings did n't have indoor plumbing or electricity			0
no one had life extending health care			0
@entity89 's @entity88 gave us another prolonged period of great income equality			2
the frenetic first days of the @entity93 reduced income inequality by lopping off the heads of the aristocracy -- the political bosses of the day			1
the minimum wage is a perfect tool for denying the youngest workers and those with limited skills trying to enter the workforce from getting that first job			2
by killing jobs at the first rungs of the economic ladder , existing businesses can not grow as rapidly , new workers do not get training and experience to move ahead			0
so everyone gets hurt and we are more equal in our reduced standard of living			0
@entity114 have already countered by insisting that the president can not hide the failure of @entity117 with distracting speeches			0
some might point out that @entity119 is one of the deadly sins , not a political program worthy of the @entity16 people			0
but most importantly the @entity125 wing of the modern @entity114 party has found new leaders in congressman @entity128 and sens. @entity129 and @entity130			0
they have presented programs for getting government out of the way of job creation , upward mobility and general prosperity			1
americans should not let @entity2 change the topic			1
he ca n't distract us from why his party 's promises that government spending would create jobs and that welfare would create hard - working , successful @entity16 and that @entity117 would allow every @entity16 to keep the health care he or she once had			0
those failures must be discussed , however painful to the politicians who made those failed promises , so that we learn from failure and move to the opposite			0
it is past time to make a u-turn on the present path where we have long ago passed the road sign that blared " warning , this way leads to @entity62			0
" we must stop barreling along towards greater disappointments			0
the president should not change the topic , he should change direction			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

@entity166 argues that president @entity2 will change the topic at tuesday 's @entity5 address
