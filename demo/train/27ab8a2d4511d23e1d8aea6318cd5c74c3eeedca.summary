@entity0 -- a @entity0 - based imam told @entity1 on monday that alleged @entity5 shooter @entity3 approached him for help finding a wife			1
@entity8 , the @entity9 chaplain at @entity10 , said @entity3 came to him at least two years ago as the cleric conducted services at @entity13 in @entity14			1
" he said he wanted someone to help him serve , deploy and be understandable and understanding of his own military career , " @entity8 said			1
" he saw himself as someone ... continuing his service with the @entity20 military till the end of his career			0
" the imam said he spoke with @entity3 on at least two occasions about his search for a spouse			2
" it 's not easy to find , in general , someone who will be willing to travel with you and deploy with you every two years , " @entity8 said			0
" but he did want a wife who would stand by him , is [ a ] loyal @entity20 , who will help him do his work and his service for the @entity20 military			0
" the imam 's comments about @entity3 's search for someone who would remain with him throughout his military career were at odds with some statements by @entity3 's family			1
relatives have said @entity3 tried unsuccessfully to leave the military early -- requests that may have come after @entity3 contacted @entity8			1
the cleric said he did try to help @entity3 in his search , thinking of women he knew to whom he could introduce the @entity46 psychiatrist , but he never heard from @entity47 again			1
authorities say @entity3 opened fire at a military processing center at @entity51 on november 5 , killing 13 people			2
@entity3 , who was seriously wounded in the incident , was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder -- charges that make him eligible for the death penalty			2
two other imams have told @entity1 similar stories about @entity3 's search for a wife , and about his conservatism and apparent devotion to @entity64 -- but those accounts seem to be inconsistent with behavior @entity3 exhibited in the last few months			1
the manager of a strip club near @entity5 has told reporters that @entity3 visited the club a handful of times , staying for several hours each time			1
" you know , for me , everything that he did is against the teachings of @entity64			0
killing fellow soldiers , fellow citizen men and women , the shooting , the bloodshed , speaks of someone who did not understand his faith very well			2
@entity64 is against going to strip clubs , but it 's also against killing fellow citizens , " @entity8 told @entity1			1
when taken as a whole , @entity3 's actions in the weeks before the attack at @entity5 -- the giving away of his possessions , his sometimes conservative dress in white @entity9 clothing , and his previous defense of suicide bombings during presentations to classmates -- seem to be those of someone who was preparing for his own death , said @entity1 terrorism analyst @entity98			2
" i think what he was doing was sort of a jihadist ' death - by - cop , ' " said @entity98 , who based his observations on news reports about @entity3			0
" here 's a guy who obviously had personal problems			0
he 's a loner , he avoids women basically , has few friends , and then grafted onto that , he finds sort of a jihadist ideology as a way of making sense of everything , and he decides to martyr himself			0
" @entity98 and other experts say @entity3 could be someone who engaged in what they call " self - radicalization " : the idea that militant religion might provide an answer to psychological problems that someone already has			0
@entity3 remained hospitalized in @entity127 , paralyzed from the waist down , his lawyer said			0
he was shot by a civilian police officer , who was also wounded in the attack .			0

imam : @entity3 wanted wife who could deal with his military career
@entity8 is third imam to tell @entity47 asked for help finding wife
manager of strip club tells reporters @entity3 visited there several times
@entity8 says strip club visits *violate* @entity64 -- and so does " killing fellow citizens "
