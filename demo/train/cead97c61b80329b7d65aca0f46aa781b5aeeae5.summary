@entity22 , @entity23 : hi			1
hope you had a great weekend			1
we 're ready to get started with a new week of commercial - free @entity0			2
from the @entity27 , i 'm @entity28			2
first up : @entity2 @entity29 : a peace deal with the @entity31 ? not an option			2
those are the words of a @entity4 military official as the country launches this massive operation against the militant group			1
this is not the first time @entity4 has tried this kind of large assault , but that same official says this is the most important because it 's aimed at what he says is the @entity31 's main area of power in @entity4			1
@entity48 has more on the assault and its impact			1
( @entity51 ) @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 : showdown in @entity4 : 28,000 troops move into @entity56 to take on the @entity31 on their turf			1
soldiers now locking horns with @entity31 leader @entity60 and up to 15,000 of the region 's most hardened @entity31 and @entity62 fighters			2
@entity64 , @entity65 : at this point , i do n't believe that the @entity4 state has a choice			1
@entity70 : defense analyst @entity64 and military officials call @entity56 " the headquarters of the @entity31 and @entity62 , " a safe haven where they are free to train and plan deadly suicide and guerilla attacks			2
@entity77 : @entity56 is very important in the assertion of @entity4 's sovereignty			1
furthermore , this is where the @entity31 have their nerve centers			2
@entity83 : @entity64 says the @entity31 know the severe and unforgiving terrain here well and will use it to their advantage			2
the much anticipated ground offense follows a recent wave of militant attacks in @entity4 that killed more than 150 security personnel and civilians			1
in several brazen assaults , armed militants humiliated security forces by penetrating the most sensitive police and military compounds			2
@entity77 : what we have seen is that suicide bombings have spread into all our cities			2
we have seen the extremists become stronger and stronger day after day			2
and that nerve center lies in @entity56			2
we have to go for it now			2
@entity70 : with troops moving in , tens of thousands of local residents are packing up and moving out			1
for weeks , they have seen @entity4 jet fighters bomb militant hideouts in preparation for the ground offensive			1
the @entity111 says 80,000 people have already registered for relief aid			2
@entity114 [ @entity115 ] : there 's war , and we have to take care of our children			2
that is why we left the area			2
@entity70 : @entity123 will watch the battle closely			2
the @entity126 administration says insurgent attacks in @entity128 are often planned and launched from @entity56			2
they 've long pressured @entity4 to get tough on militants here			1
three times the @entity4 army has launched military offensives in @entity56			1
all three times , they failed			2
the @entity4 army now with a fourth opportunity , one it can ill afford to lose			1
( @entity137 ) troops in @entity139 @entity29 : okay , we 're heading to @entity139 now , which is where 3,500 @entity143 troops wo n't be going			1
they were scheduled to deploy to the @entity147 nation in january and to replace a @entity149 unit that 's serving there right now			2
but the military says the troops are n't going to @entity139 and the @entity149 unit is still on schedule to return home			1
it 's all part of the @entity143 plan to gradually decrease the number of @entity143 forces in @entity139			0
@entity143 combat troops are scheduled to be out of the country by next august			1
and all @entity143 forces are expected to leave @entity139 by the end of 2011			0
that schedule is based on the ability of @entity139 's security forces to take control of the country			0
but it could be affected by ongoing violence			0
the latest example : four @entity139 soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb over the weekend			0
however , @entity173 , the @entity143 ambassador to @entity139 , says the plan for @entity143 forces is still on track			0
@entity173 , @entity143 @entity177 : as for our schedule of troop withdrawal , we 've been pretty clear about when the troops would be withdrawn			1
we 've been working very hard with @entity139 security forces			0
so , our plan is to draw down the troops as we 've said we 're gon na do			1
@entity6 @entity29 : and the @entity185 says people in southwest @entity187 and @entity188 , @entity189 -- which is actually part of @entity187 -- should keep an eye on @entity6			1
yesterday , this storm reached category five status with top winds around 180 miles per hour			0
that made @entity6 the second strongest hurricane in the eastern @entity9 in more than 10 years			1
sunday morning , the storm was about 500 miles south of @entity199 , @entity187			0
forecasters expect it to move north and get closer to the @entity202 later this week , although they do predict it 's going to lose strength between now and then			0
