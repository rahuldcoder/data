-- is anyone else wondering why the @entity5 , @entity4 rape victim 's two best friends testified against her ? with this week 's arrest of two other girls who " menaced " the teen victim on @entity10 and @entity11 , we have the beginnings of an answer			1
rape culture is not only the province of boys			1
the often hidden culture of girl cruelty can discourage accusers from coming forward and punish them viciously once they do			1
this week , two teenage boys were found guilty of raping a 16 - year - old classmate while she was apparently drunk and passed out during a night of parties last august			0
everyone who was there and said nothing that night was complicit ; if we want to prevent another @entity5 , the role of other girls must also be considered			1
on the night in question , girls watched the victim ( @entity31 ) become so drunk she could hardly walk			1
why did n't any of them help her ? why , after @entity31 endured the agonizing experience of a trial in which she viewed widely circulated photos of herself naked and unconscious , did one of the arrested girls tweet : " you ripped my family apart , you made my cousin cry , so when i see you xxxxx , it 's gone be a homicide			1
" why were two lifelong friends sitting on the other side of the courtroom ? the accusation of rape disrupts the intricate social ecosystem of a high school , one in which girls often believe that they must preserve both their own reputations and relationships with boys above all else			1
this is a process that begins for girls long before their freshman year and can have violent consequences			0
from the earliest age , girls are flooded with conflicting messages about their sexuality			2
they are socialized to be " good girls " above all : kind , polite and selfless			0
yet they are also told -- via media images , the clothing that 's marketed to them and the messages conveyed by some adults -- that they will be valued , given attention and loved for being sexy			1
the result is a near - constant anxiety about not being feminine or sexy enough			0
opinion : @entity5 case shows how the rules have changed meanwhile , girls consume romance narratives that tell them the most important relationships they can have are with boys who love them			1
they also observe a huge amount of psychological aggression among girls on television and in movies , often portrayed as comedy			0
last year , researchers found that girls of elementary school age were more likely than boys to commit acts of social aggression at school after viewing them on television			1
no surprise , then , that when the first crushes are confided in elementary school , it 's not uncommon for girls to turn on each other if they believe a friend is competing for the attentions of a boy they like			2
it often does not occur to them to reprimand the boy			0
this pattern is fairly innocuous in childhood , but by adolescence , it could have far more serious implications : instead of grabbing the hand of a girl too drunk to consent and taking her to a safe place , some girls may instead angrily watch the drunken girl leave with a boy , figuring she deserves what she gets			2
from late elementary school onward , the label " slut " hovers dangerously over girls ' every move			2
most girls who are called sluts are not even sexually active			0
the word is used to distinguish " good " girls from " bad , " and the definition is constantly shifting			0
few girls are let in on the criteria for who gets called a slut in the first place			2
the insecurity creates an incentive to call out someone else lest you be next			0
in 2011 , a study by the @entity144 found that girls in grades 7 - 12 were far more likely than boys to experience sexual harassment , including rumors , both in person and online			2
and @entity152 interviewed 50 girls and women for her book , " slut ! growing up female with a @entity160 ; " all of them told her girls , far more than boys , were at the forefront of the slut rumor mill. i am not saying that @entity31 was raped because of girls ' silence			1
girls may choose not to speak up for many reasons , but it 's hard to ignore the power of a culture that pushes them to choose boys over each other and punish other girls to protect their own reputations			1
we must talk to girls about their responsibility in situations like this			0
if we want to prevent another @entity5 , we need to teach children from an early age about gender - based violence			1
the word " slut " is not just an epithet ; it is a word that has given adolescents permission to abandon and hurt each other when a girl needs support most			0
girls must understand not only their moral obligation but their power to be allies to each other at parties and other potentially unsafe spaces for girls			0
if boys knew that girls banded together to support each other , they would be less inclined to share on social media , much less commit , these horrific acts of sexual violence			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0

@entity210 : some of @entity5 rape victim 's girlfriends testified against her
she says ' rape culture ' affects girl *behavior* too , silences them when another girl is in *trouble*
she says girls *absorb* message from early age : be sexy , compete for boys ' attention
@entity210 : labeling others " slut " allows girls to *withhold* help . they must be taught different
