@entity0 -- my name is @entity4			2
i 'm an associate producer at @entity1 , and i have systemic lupus erythematosus			1
it 's an autoimmune disease where the body 's immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks healthy tissue			1
it can cause damage to many parts of body such as joints , skin , kidneys , heart , lungs , blood vessels and the brain			1
lupus is one of the most complicated and cruelest autoimmune diseases			1
simply put : it 's difficult to diagnose , hard to live with and challenging to treat			1
if i could write a letter to lupus , i would say " i want me back , i 've had enough			1
" as a junior at @entity27 , i felt like i was on top of the world			2
i went to a great school , i was doing exactly what i love ( journalism ) , and then on september 11 , 2001 , i began to get unexplained illnesses one after another			2
eventually , i landed in a hospital bed with an iv pumping a cocktail of drugs meant to cure " a series of infections " ravaging my body			1
when i finally felt reasonable enough to go to class , i could n't remember things			2
my essays , as one professor told me , suddenly " read like ramblings			2
" i was n't me			2
that semester , i ended up taking incompletes in all of my classes			2
my doctors and professors declared i was overwhelmed with catching up in my classes and the anxiety of it all consumed me			2
little did i know that it would be a decade later before i would officially find out it was really systemic lupus erythematosus			1
my diagnosis came as i was entering what i considered the magical part of my life			2
i had married , had a beautiful daughter and was working my dream job ( @entity1 ) and finally felt like i was walking in my purpose			2
i began to have horrific migraines , excruciating nerve pain down my left arm , and bruises and rashes started to appear more and more often			2
initially , i thought i was just tired and it was the allergies and the bruises			2
i simply attributed it to being anemic			0
this was until my esophagus began to feel as if it was closing up			0
i went to a physician , and he said i had a tumor on the shoulder and that must be causing everything i was feeling			0
when i went to the surgical oncologist , she said " it 's not cancer " and referred me to an amazing internist			1
i had already gone through the gamut of diagnoses : leukemia , thoracic outlet syndrome , sarcoidosis			0
i was completely over the diagnosis portion of the process			0
my life had become work , bed and repeat			0
i remember the appointment like it was yesterday			0
when i came back in for my follow - up , i was told i had lupus			1
a disease that has no cure			1
to me , that diagnosis was not a death sentence , but a sentence to feel the way that i felt at the moment for the rest of my life			0
i felt pain , i felt exhausted and i was not me			0
having lupus has been like having a horrific hangover while doing two - a - day workouts -- # exhausting			1
no one knows what is wrong unless you tell them			0
there is no escaping the pain , and the only way out is to sleep or die			0
i 've felt like lupus at times has sucked the life out of me			1
it 's shifted my priorities , taken away many of the things i love because i 'm stuck in a holding pattern just treating the symptoms			1
fighting this disease has been no easy ride			0
the disease has affected my brain , @entity131 system , lungs and heart			0
i take nine medications to treat symptoms			1
meaning , this is what i had to do to get through the day			0
those drugs include chemotherapy , an antimalarial , a beta - blocker , an anticonvulsant , corticosteroids and a drug used to treat nerve damage			1
none of the drugs is specifically meant to treat lupus			1
when people see me , they always say , " you do n't look sick			0
" this has sort of been a gift and a curse for me			0
on one hand , i did n't want people to look at me as if i had a disability			0
on the other , i wanted people to know what i 've been able to accomplish in spite of the disease			0
it 's an invisible fight for me , but now is my time to make some noise so we can find a cure			1
if no one is aware of my struggle , we ca n't get there			0
i want me back , and i 've realized that every breath i take is blessed with a responsibility			0
a responsibility to raise awareness about life with lupus and the need for a cure			1
every day , this is what keeps me going			0
lupus is one of @entity182 's least recognized major diseases , although 1.5 million @entity182 are living with it			1
research is not keeping pace with the research for other diseases of similar scope and devastation			0
a study conducted by the @entity191 found 72 % of @entity182 from 18 to 34 ( those most at risk for lupus ) have either not heard about lupus or know nothing more than the name			1
in the past century , only one drug has been developed and approved to treat the disease			0
with the ebbs and flows of the economy , this disease has taken the backseat to research investment priorities			0
the @entity191 is the oldest and largest nonprofit organization focused on improving quality of life and finding a cure for lupus			1
to find out more information about the disease or to make a contribution , head over to @entity212 .			1
