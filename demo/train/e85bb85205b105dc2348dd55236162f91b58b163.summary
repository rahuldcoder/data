@entity0 -- in the bitter political debate over health care reform two years ago , one of the most contentious issues was a proposed advisory board that would recommend how to achieve needed but as - yet - unreachable @entity8 savings			1
opponents dubbed the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) a " death panel " that would ration medical coverage for senior citizens based on cost and effectiveness , rather than decisions reached between patient and doctor			2
supporters called such rhetoric overheated and misleading , arguing the advisory board was necessary to motivate a reluctant health care industry to adopt cost - cutting reforms that @entity23 had proven unwilling or unable to impose			1
now the @entity24 will consider repealing the advisory board provision this week in an election - year move that rekindles the fiery emotions of the health care fight back in 2009 and 2010			1
while the repeal effort is expected to eventually fall short , it gives opponents of health care reform a rallying point for their continued efforts to undermine the 2010 law			0
some of the rhetoric from two years earlier has re-emerged , such as warnings of a government takeover of health care			0
" what we oppose is the president deciding who gets what , " rep. @entity40 , @entity41 , told a news conference wednesday			0
earlier this week , @entity48 rep. @entity48 of @entity49 told reporters that the @entity10 panel was " designed to put a @entity0 bureaucrat between the patient and their doctor			2
" that 's not the intent or the reality of the advisory board , insisted dr. @entity59 , the former administrator of the federal @entity60			0
for example , the law targeted by the repeal effort specifically forbids the advisory board from rationing health care to reduce spending			0
" we 're in a very polarized era			0
it 's hard to have rational conversations with people " on the issue , @entity59 told @entity1			0
@entity72 , a senior fellow at the @entity73 , said this week that " charges that the board is going to be able to deny people care are just flat out wrong			0
" " the law makes every effort to restrict the board so that it ca n't do that , " @entity72 said			0
" and in fact , if anything , the charge is the opposite of the truth			0
" the 15 - member @entity10 board would comprise independent experts to recommend @entity8 cost reductions starting in 2015 if @entity23 and the health care industry and insurers fail to agree on $ 300 billion in savings called for in the health care reform law			1
designed as a nonpolitical solution in the event of legislative stalemate , the panel 's recommendations do not require congressional approval but can be offset by @entity23			1
some critics , including @entity100 who back health care reform , cite the independent board 's relative autonomy as a reason for eliminating it			2
in addition , @entity108 sponsors have added long - desired tort reform provisions against frivolous lawsuits to offset the cost of eliminating the panel intended to bring @entity8 savings			1
however , the legal lobby and many democrats oppose tort reforms , raising questions about the final makeup of the bill			2
according to @entity59 , opposition to the @entity10 panel breaks down into three groups : a " significant minority " that hates the 2010 health care reform law and wants to scare people about it ; political opponents of president @entity129 trying to hurt his re-election chances , and health care providers and insurers " doing quite well in the status quo " who are unwilling to commit to @entity8 reforms			1
despite such opposition , no one disputes the need to change @entity8 in order to keep it solvent in coming decades , as baby boomers reach retirement age and flood its ranks			2
republicans who have long opposed @entity8 want to lower the cost by eventually making it a subsidized program instead of a government - run system			1
the @entity24 @entity108 budget for 2013 made public tuesday would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee - for - service @entity8 plan or opting for a @entity8 - approved private plan , all of which would be available via a new @entity8 exchange			1
no matter which plan they chose , including the traditional @entity8 plan , seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice			2
the 2010 health care reform law sought cost reductions in @entity8 through more efficient delivery of services			1
for example , it envisioned increased collaboration through electronic medical records to reduce repetitive and costly tests , as well as basing reimbursement on quality of care rather than quantity of services provided			0
" it 's conceivable you could ratchet down on payments for routine mris or cat scans and use some of that money to shore up payments to providers and ... make the whole system a little more efficient , " noted @entity176 , a professor of economics and public affairs at @entity180 's @entity179			0
under the law , the @entity10 panel would step in if targeted cost reductions went unmet			2
those seeking repeal of the advisory board say it will lead to indiscriminate cost - cutting rather than the intended reforms to maintain @entity8 's long - term solvency			1
rep. @entity200 , @entity202 - @entity201 , who practiced ophthalmology for 16 years prior to her election to @entity23 in 2010 , said @entity8 reimbursements already were being lowered to a point where some physicians can not afford to treat @entity8 patients			1
" that is the last thing our seniors need , " @entity200 said wednesday			0
" in many practices across the country , that threat will only increase with @entity10			0
" rep. @entity215 , @entity216 , said at a monday news conference that the advisory board " will do nothing to change how @entity8 works , " adding " it will simply say we 've run out of money , and now we 're cutting			2
" the @entity223 , a major physician 's advocacy organization , also wants to repeal the advisory board even though it supported the broader health care reform law			0
it already wrestles with what has been a 15 - year problem involving @entity8 reimbursements that exemplifies the difficulty of reforming the program			1
the @entity231 provision enacted in 1997 limits increases in @entity8 costs to the same rate of growth in the gross domestic product			1
under the formula , the costs have repeatedly risen higher than planned			0
rather than cutting payments to @entity8 doctors , @entity23 has regularly authorized extra money to make up the difference , with the latest so - called " doc fix " set to expire at the end of 2012			1
that means doctors face a 30 % cut in @entity8 reimbursements from the government in january , and now the @entity10 panel would be empowered to recommend steeper cuts , @entity223 board chairman dr. @entity244 told @entity1 in a telephone interview			1
the @entity223 wants @entity23 to stabilize funding for @entity8 reimbursements for five years to allow doctors time to work out reforms outlined in the 2010 health care legislation			1
according to @entity244 , the fear is that the @entity10 panel will recommend across - the - board spending cuts that drive doctors away from @entity8 patients while failing to inspire the necessary reforms			1
" a board that does n't have to answer to anybody and has the latitude to make dramatic cuts has consequences for our patients , " said @entity244 , later adding : " it 's very hard to do that kind of innovation when there is uncertainty and the threat of large cuts			2
" for @entity59 , the question is , " how do you create the political and social will for uncomfortable changes ? " " the evidence so far is that motivation solely from inside health care , changing itself , is insufficient , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity282 contributed to this report .			0
