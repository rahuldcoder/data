@entity0 -- @entity2 , a @entity3 banking giant , has paid $ 340 million to settle allegations it was involved in money laundering for @entity7 clients			1
the settlement was reached with the @entity9 tuesday , before a hearing due wednesday			0
the hearing has now been adjourned			0
@entity2 -- which faced the loss of its @entity14 banking license alongside fines for alleged breaches -- had pre-tax earnings of $ 6.76 billion in 2011 , and the fine is " easily manageable , " according to a note by analyst @entity20 of @entity21			1
banks : too big to prosecute ? " reaching an early settlement means that @entity24 avoids the potentially awkward hearing with the @entity26 ...			0
and , critically , eliminates the immediate risk that the bank could lose its @entity30 banking licence , " @entity20 said			0
however , investigations into the bank by other authorities including the @entity34 and the @entity35 continue , and " this lone settlement does not draw a line through the matter , " @entity20 said			0
a statement from @entity2 said , " a formal agreement containing the detailed terms of the settlement is expected to be concluded shortly			0
" the group added that it " continues to engage constructively with the other relevant @entity14 authorities			2
" what was @entity2 accused of ? @entity2 was accused of helping @entity7 avoid @entity14 sanctions by concealing $ 250 billion worth of transactions over nearly 10 years , according to banking regulators in @entity30			1
more : culture shift needed in banking ? the @entity9 accused the @entity0 - based banking group of concealing 60,000 transactions with @entity7 clients , including the @entity54 , from 2001 to 2010			1
the department says there is also evidence of similar schemes to conduct business with other @entity14 - sanctioned countries such as @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			2
why are there sanctions in place ? the @entity14 and its allies have increased economic sanctions against @entity7 during the past few years in an effort to deter the @entity70 from developing its nuclear capabilities			1
@entity7 has argued that its goal is to produce energy and medical isotopes , but @entity14 officials say the @entity7 are developing weapons			1
more : age of irresponsibility in banks ? @entity2 allegedly falsified business and official records to mask transactions with @entity7 customers that were subject to @entity14 economic sanctions , the @entity9 said			1
in exchange , the global banking group reaped " hundreds of millions " of dollars in fees , according to an order issued by the @entity30 authorities			0
the regulators said the bank 's actions left " the @entity14 financial system vulnerable to terrorists , weapons dealers , drug kingpins and corrupt regimes , and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity			2
" how was @entity2 alleged to have violated the rules ? the regulators said @entity2 had a well - established policy to " repair " documents in so - called u-turn transactions , in which offshore money passes through the @entity14 financial system on its way to other offshore accounts			1
under federal law , banks are obligated to ensure that such transactions do not violate @entity14 sanctions			1
but regulators say @entity2 's @entity30 branch regularly manipulated wire transfers that would have identified @entity7 customers in the u-turn transactions			1
more : banking ethics " in question " according to the order , an official in the bank 's @entity14 division warned top bank managers in @entity0 in 2006 that the bank could face " serious criminal liability , " according to internal emails			2
how was the warning received ? the warning was allegedly rejected by the recipient , who regulators say responded by writing in an email : " you f - ing @entity14			2
who are you to tell us , the rest of the world , that we are not going to deal with @entity7			0
[ sic ] " according to the regulators , @entity2 's most senior management , " designed and implemented an elaborate scheme by which to use its @entity30 branch as a front for prohibited dealings with @entity7 -- dealings that indisputably helped sustain a global threat to peace and stability			1
" the regulator had ordered executives of @entity2 -- which it says was operating as a " rogue institution " -- to appear in @entity30 wednesday to answer the charges			2
how did @entity2 respond to the allegations ? @entity2 refuted the charges , saying " well over 99.9 % " of the referenced transactions complied with @entity14 regulations			1
it said it strongly rejected the position and portrayal of facts made by the @entity14 regulator			0
the statement said the group had approached @entity14 agencies in january 2010 and informed them they had initiated a review of historic @entity14 dollar transactions and compliance with @entity14 sanctions			1
it said the " group does not believe the order issued by the @entity168 presents a full and accurate picture of the facts , " and " @entity2 ceased all new business with @entity7 customers in any currency over five years ago			1
" how much will this damage @entity2 ? the large fine was expected and , as @entity20 pointed out , is unlikely to significantly dent the bank 's balance sheet			0
however , pressure has come down on chief executive @entity178 , who flew to @entity30 to deal with the allegations			0
@entity178 has been at the bank 's helm since 2006 following four years as group finance director			0
@entity183 , senior bank analyst at @entity184 , said in a note the fine was a " little underwhelming " given the strength of the original charges			0
the bank has been " tarred " but immediate regulatory pressure will be " relieved for now , " he said			0
" it does n't mean corporates will withdraw their business , but they will likely ask more questions , " he added			0
