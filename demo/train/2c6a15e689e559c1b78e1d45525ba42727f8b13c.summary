-- a pop star could have a quickie @entity2 tomorrow , to a man she meets tonight , if she so chooses			2
@entity5 , convicted of the murder of his pregnant wife and on death row , has an inalienable right to a prison wedding with a female pen pal if the mood strikes him			0
@entity14 grandmother @entity13 holds the @entity16 title for most marriages : 23			0
one lasted just 36 hours			0
she 's on the lookout for no. 24 , and when she finds him , no law can stop her from marrying him			1
the @entity23 @entity22 has held unanimously that " the freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men			1
marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man			0
" so basic , so important , so fundamental , in constitutional parlance , that no state can interfere with even the most reckless heterosexual nuptials			0
yet in most states , my friends @entity41 and @entity44 , " free men " together 16 years and lovingly raising a son , are shut out of the 1,100 federal and hundreds of state legal benefits that come with marriage			0
these include the right to visit a spouse in a hospital and make medical decisions ; employer sick and bereavement leave ; inheritance rights ; the right to give unlimited gifts to a spouse without gift tax ; disability , pension , and @entity59 benefits ; the right to bring a wrongful death case ; the right to refuse to testify against a spouse ; or the right to prevent the deportation of a foreign - born partner by marriage , among others			2
perhaps most poignant , and often lost in this debate , are children in same - sex families : kids like my friends ' son @entity71 , growing up with the sting of knowing that his parents are second - class citizens in their own country			1
study after study finds that something about marriage makes us live longer , healthier lives			0
married folks have significantly better mental health , engage in fewer risky behaviors , eat healthier , have less illness and are just plain happier			0
and do n't tell me that civil unions are exactly the same as marriage			2
if that 's true , then let 's let gays and lesbians pick first			2
if they pick marriage , and heterosexuals are relegated to civil unions , no problem , right , since they are exactly the same ? the trial challenging @entity98 , the law that bans same - sex marriage in @entity100 , started monday in @entity101			1
this will be the first federal trial in @entity23 history in which testimony will be heard and recorded about the harm to gay and lesbian citizens caused by laws like @entity98			1
@entity110 : is prop 8 constitutional ? share your view as a civil rights lawyer for 23 years , there is no question at all in my mind that as a matter of constitutional law , the federal court must strike down any law that creates a subclass of @entity23 , shutting them out of legal privileges and protections available to others , merely because they are gay			1
demeaning and disrespecting gay people is a constitutional affront			0
seven years ago , the @entity23 @entity22 handed down @entity129 , the gay community 's @entity130 , striking down state laws that criminalized private , consensual gay sex , saying : " the petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives			1
the state can not demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime			0
" when all the testimony about legal rights , benefits and protections in the @entity98 trial is said and done , @entity142 is ultimately about just that			1
our gay and lesbian friends and neighbors are entitled to respect for their private lives , and the state can not demean their existence , even by majority vote			0
seven out of 10 @entity23 supported laws banning interracial marriage at the time our president 's black father and white mother married			2
but the @entity22 knew that our federal constitution 's guarantee of equal protection of the law was a bedrock @entity23 principle that sometimes requires the courts to lead , and so lead they did , striking down antimiscegenation laws in 1967			1
now , only lunatic - fringe bigots would support those laws			2
my favorite @entity171 8 placard read : " when do i get to vote on your marriage ? " same - sex marriage may be a politically volatile and complex issue , but as a matter of federal constitutional law , it 's simple : fundamental rights must be granted equally across the board to all @entity23 citizens			1
the rest , constitutionally speaking , is just noise			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

@entity188 : heterosexuals may marry in jail , after one - night stands , many times over
yet , @entity188 says , *longtime* same - sex couples with children ca n't marry
@entity188 writes that the @entity199 demands end to *discriminatory* @entity98
she says prop 8 *violates* the @entity199 's guarantee of equal protection under the law
