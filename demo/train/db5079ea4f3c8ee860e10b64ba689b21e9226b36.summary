-- when i was 5 , my parents went to a conference on @entity4 and let me tag along , leaving my brothers landlocked in central @entity6			0
two memories stand out from my first encounter with the watery majesty of this @entity11 icon			0
@entity4 's relaxed atmosphere is ideal for families			0
for starters , it 's the first place i ever heard the term " market price			0
" @entity18 encouraged me to eat whatever i wanted at restaurants -- no kid 's menu here -- so i tried my hand at swordfish			0
i figured anything so fresh they could n't put a price on it until the day it was served had to be good			0
and for years , i ordered based on that idea			0
from the right side of the menu			0
if it was fresh ( and expensive ) , it had to be the best			0
more boats than cars second , water was everywhere			1
i 'd been to the beach before , but never an actual island			1
it seemed like @entity4 had more boats than my hometown had cars			1
and even then , i understood that the marinas were the real lifeblood of the community			0
on my most recent visit to @entity4 , my brothers and their wives joined me , while my parents stayed home with the gaggle of grandkids			0
but i discovered a few constants remain : from fresh cobia ( available only in may and june ) to wild shrimp caught in local waters , ordering " market price " from the menu is n't a bad way to go			0
and each marina celebrates the spirit of the island with its own special style			1
explore them , one by one			0
@entity65 : a coastal @entity67 retreat harbour @entity68 : the classic known for its candy - striped , red - and - white lighthouse , the @entity71 marina is easily the most - touristed waterfront on @entity4			1
large yachts moor behind the newly expanded seawall , shops stock the requisite " i heart @entity4 " souvenirs , and water sport outfitters launch @entity80 and hoist para-sails in @entity82			0
the waterside restaurants do n't shine for their innovative cuisine , but they 're worth a stop for the prime real estate -- westward - facing @entity71 is one of the best spots on the island to catch the sunset			1
@entity65 : top 10 budget getaways while there : hard - bottomed @entity96 boats crouch closer to the water than a traditional boat does			1
we booked a one - hour tour with @entity101 ( www.h2osportsonline.com or [ 843 ] 671 - 4386 ) and spent the afternoon watching dolphins play			1
@entity103 : the local you do n't get more homegrown than @entity103 , a modest port just off the @entity106 , where area residents drydock their boats			1
at @entity109 , a rickety seafood shack with killer views of the water , we stopped in for a bite ( food = fried ) and lingered on the deck for ( my brother , @entity116 , might argue in spite of ) the nightly strum-fest			0
www.broadcreekmarinahh.com or ( 843 ) 681 - 3625 while there : join capt. @entity120 , a huge @entity121 fan with a sly smile , a weathered face , and a twinkling laugh , for a sunset sail on his 45 - foot sloop cheers			1
www.cheerscharters.com or ( 843 ) 671 - 1800 @entity127 : the beach bum i thought we were going to have to drag my always - up - for - a - good - time brother , @entity131 , away from @entity127			1
this laid - back harbor feels like a @entity134 - style fishing village , complete with blue clapboard buildings connected by a sprawling weathered deck			1
it 's @entity138 meets @entity140 cool , polished with @entity11 charm			0
the omnipresent music ranges from @entity121 and @entity143 by the dj to jam - friendly local bands			1
dancing is optional , but you wo n't want to be the only one left sitting			0
@entity65 : great summer getaway while there : @entity151 , locals and tourists mingle in the late afternoon over heavy - handed cocktails ; ice - cold brews ; and steaming , hot - boiled shrimp at the open - air @entity158 ( www.saltydog.com or [ 843 ] 363 - 2198 )			1
arrive early and snag a table ; they tend to fill up quickly			0
@entity161 : the unassuming naturalist the quiet @entity161 and neighboring @entity163 ( just across @entity164 278 ) , with upscale boutiques , smartly casual restaurants , and untainted @entity168 views , ooze understated elegance without an ounce of priss			0
capt. @entity174 's little @entity173 deckboat bobs among @entity176 - sized mega-yachts but somehow does n't seem out of place			1
@entity178 specializes in personalized , eco-friendly trips of @entity103 and @entity180			1
www.lowcountrynaturetours.com or ( 843 ) 683 - 0187 while there : the 11 - mile saltwater lagoon system in @entity163 is a maze of water courses , full of redfish , trout , and black drum			1
we rented kayaks for an early morning paddle through the tree - canopied canals			1
@entity192 can hook you up with everything you need , from kayaks to private fly - fishing charters with capt. @entity197 or ( 843 ) 785 - 2449 @entity199 : the everyman with a working boatyard and a everyone - knows - your - name dockside bar ( captain @entity205 's ) , @entity199 gives off a relaxed vibe that transcends labels such as " local " and " tourist			1
" our group settled onto the patio at @entity212 for brunch -- a perfect place to dawdle on a lazy morning ( [ 843 ] 785 - 4950 )			2
my personal favorite : the shrimp hash -- a hearty combo of poached eggs , delicate shrimp and spicy sausage -- is like something you 'd expect for breakfast on board a fishing boat			2
my brother bogarted the sushi nachos with seared tuna and avocado			0
and the sisters - in - law did serious damage to the dessert - like bananas @entity235			2
while there : reserve a spot on the @entity238 or flying circus catamarans for a bring - your - own - picnic twilight cruise through the sound -- a trip highlight			2
www.hiltonheadisland.com/sailing or ( 843 ) 686 - 2582 @entity244 : the seafood connection local fish and shrimpboats unload their nets along the piers at @entity244 , where a trio of restaurants , all with waterside dining , take advantage of the seasonal catch			1
@entity256 's on the @entity257 ( www.hudsonsonthedocks.com or [ 843 ] 681 - 2772 ) is a perennial crowd - pleaser with down - home seafood platters			2
@entity261 's @entity260 ( @entity262 / or [ 843 ] 342 - 9066 ) , a khakis - and - button - down kind of place , delivers she - crab soup and fried green tomatoes with a shrimp - and - crawfish salsa			2
the vibrant @entity271 , with great food , an extensive wine list , and an anything - goes attitude , suited us best			2
if cobia is in season , a local catch with the density of swordfish and the flakiness of cod , this is the place to try it			2
www.boathouserestaurant.net or ( 843 ) 681 - 3663 while there : the @entity256 seafood market is the go - to for fresh oysters from the nearby @entity285 and wild @entity164 shrimp just off the boat			2
if you 're renting a house or condo , stock up to create your own locally inspired feast			0
