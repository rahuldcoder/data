-- @entity1 is a lucky nation			1
when the country was about to plunge into an economic depression , the head of the central bank was a man who had dedicated his life to studying how to prevent a recurrence of the @entity8			1
and now that @entity11 chairman @entity10 is stepping aside , the economist nominated to succeed him , @entity12 , is once again exactly the right person for the challenges of the moment			1
@entity12 , not much more than 5 feet tall , is a towering intellect who commands respect from those who understand the intricacies of monetary policy and can explain them to those of more modest intellectual gifts , a skill that will prove useful when she faces confirmation in the @entity27			1
she will become the first woman to lead @entity1 's central bank ; an apt way to mark the 100th anniversary of the @entity11			1
she will also become the world 's most powerful woman			1
if confirmed , @entity12 will likely introduce meaningful , if very subtle , changes to the job			1
under the outgoing chairman , the @entity11 applied innovative and aggressive policies , flooding the financial system by adding trillions of dollars to the central bank 's balance sheet and bringing interest rates down to nearly zero to keep the economy from sinking			1
the worst of that crisis is now over -- unless @entity47 sends the economy into the abyss			0
the @entity11 now confronts two very different challenges			1
first , how and when to bring interest rates back to more normal levels without triggering a new recession -- the dreaded " taper			0
" second , what , if anything , to do about @entity1 's stubborn unemployment rate , which remains at historically high levels			1
@entity12 has a history of voting in line with @entity10			1
she is not about to bring any sudden changes to monetary policy			0
but she has a track record , evidenced by her many academic writings and speeches , that emphasizes the need to create conditions that stimulate employment			0
unusual for an economist of her caliber , she has not drifted away into the abstractions of economic analysis and statistics ; she has kept her eyes on what 's critical -- the people			2
her research has centered on unemployment , on the best way to modulate government policies to benefit the people			2
" long term unemployment , " she told an audience earlier this year , " is devastating to workers and their families			2
" with inflation under control and unemployment still high , she said , " it is entirely appropriate for progress in attaining maximum employment to take center stage			0
" those views will influence her work as @entity11 chairwoman			1
the @entity11 has two tasks -- to fight inflation and promote economic growth , including employment			1
the two are sometimes seen as conflicting with one another			0
to fight inflation , the @entity11 usually raises rates			1
but raising rates tends to depress economic activity			0
in balancing the two tasks , @entity12 will tilt slightly in favor of employment			1
that means she is more likely to leave interest rates at low levels until unemployment lessens			0
@entity12 's resume is impeccable			1
she chaired president @entity113 's @entity112 , served on the @entity114 , taught at @entity115 , and was president of the @entity117			1
when she went home after work , her mind was not exactly at rest			0
she shared her evenings with her husband , @entity123 , a @entity124 - winning economist , described by some simply as " a genius			0
" he is such a luminary that when she was a professor at the @entity128 , her former colleagues now admit that they mostly thought of her as @entity123 's wife			0
in the 1990s , she successfully persuaded then - @entity11 chairman @entity130 that zero inflation would be harmful to the economy			2
to this day , @entity130 has only the highest praise for her rigorous intellectual analysis and powers of persuasion			0
her emphasis on employment qualifies her as an inflation " dove " and some critics worry that she will let her guard down if inflation resurfaces			0
but she has been sharply critical of @entity11 policies that allowed inflation to rise decades ago , vowing the @entity11 should never let that happen again			2
the country might be in better shape today if policymakers had listened to her more carefully			0
in late 2007 she warned that the economy was about to take a hard fall			0
now she has been ranked the best forecaster among all of the @entity11 's luminaries , and possibly the most qualified @entity11 chair in history			1
when the time comes to start raising interest rates , the country will be in good hands			0
@entity12 has said that she plans to go slowly , carefully and in creative ways			2
she revealed some of her ideas a few months ago , speaking of a plan to raise rates " in a way that 's novel , that we have n't tried in the past			0
" essentially , hike the rates the @entity11 pays to banks in order to gently boost rates across the economy			2
@entity12 is so clearly the right person for the job that it is disappointing the @entity174 handled the entire process in such an undignified way			1
traditionally , the selection of the @entity11 chief has not been subjected to political winds			2
but the @entity174 let it be known that its first choice for the post was the controversial economist @entity182			0
the trial balloon hissed noisily before it came crashing down			0
last month , @entity182 sent a letter to president @entity185 asking that his name be withdrawn from consideration in order to avoid an " acrimonious " confirmation battle in @entity47			1
the process was unnecessarily disrespectful to @entity182 and to @entity12			2
she should have been the president 's first and only choice			2
@entity193 that the president came to his senses finally			0
@entity12 is about to become a superstar			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

president @entity185 nominated @entity12 to be the next head of the @entity11
@entity203 : @entity12 is exactly the right person for the challenges of our time
she says @entity12 will likely do more to reduce unemployment and promote growth
@entity211 : as the first woman to lead @entity1 's central bank , she *'ll* be a powerful force
