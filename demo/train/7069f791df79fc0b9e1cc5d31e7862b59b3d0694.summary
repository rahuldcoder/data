we can assume that when @entity2 was interred by the monks in the church of the @entity5 , possibly with a few of @entity8 's henchmen present to see that it was done , it would not have been the burial a king of @entity12 could have expected			1
the confirmation that the remains found in @entity15 are those of @entity2 means that , at last , this can be put right and he can be laid to rest with the solemnity and dignity that is appropriate for an anointed king			1
even more significantly , the finding and reinterment of @entity2 's remains will , we hope , open up the debate about the king and his reputation			1
it would make such a difference if people would start to look into the history of this much maligned monarch without the old prejudices			2
perhaps , then , they will see past the myth and innuendo that has blackened his name and find the truth			0
no one is going to suggest that he was a saint - i have said on many occasions that we are not the @entity41 - but even a cursory reading of the known facts will show that the @entity8 representation of @entity2 , especially that in @entity45 's well known play , just does n't stand up			1
read more : @entity2 's story " stuff of legend " @entity45 wrote a great play but even he must have been aware that he was twisting the facts in order to make it more dramatic			1
after all , he called it a " tragedy " not a " history			0
" his @entity2 is a villain and a superb villain at that , but @entity45 was not writing history , no matter what the @entity59 might have thought			2
there are many instances where the portrayal just does not fit the historical record			0
for instance , in one of his three plays about @entity67 , @entity45 has @entity2 , later @entity2 , killing the @entity69 at the first battle of @entity71			2
at the time of that fight , @entity72 was n't @entity75 and , more cogently , he was n't yet three years old ! the @entity76 was founded as the @entity76 almost 90 years ago			2
it was re-founded in 1956 and changed its name three years later , as a result of which , it took on a more missionary approach to its aims of securing a reassessment of the material relating to the @entity86 of this king			2
this was not new , of course , as reassessment had begun in the 17th century after the death of the last @entity92 monarch and it has continued ever since			0
over the centuries , the approach to @entity2 's reputation has swung like a pendulum			1
if , as a result of the finding of @entity2 and all the publicity it has engendered , people can be encouraged to read the facts for themselves , it will be a truly great event and all who have been involved in the project are to be congratulated			1
i have followed its progress from an early stage when @entity108 , a member of the @entity76 whose idea it was , first came to me to ask if she thought it was viable and would the society be willing to back it			0
i have tried to encourage her at times when doors were being shut and when there were setbacks and together we appealed for money when there was a shortfall			0
it is a great testament to @entity108 's tenacity and bloody - mindedness that the project has been so successful			0
read more : @entity2 : the king and the car park ? @entity2 was no saint but neither was he a criminal			1
all but one of the so - called crimes laid at his door can be refuted by the facts			0
the one that can not is the disappearance of his nephews , the " @entity142 " and the answer to that question is simply that no - one knows what happened to them			0
all that follows is conjecture - they just disappeared			0
@entity2 had no need to kill them ; they had been declared bastards			2
@entity8 needed them out of the way , but he got so scared whenever a pretender appeared that it is likely that he knew they were alive at the time @entity2 died at @entity156			1
did they die in 1483 or 1485 or were they spirited out of the country to their aunt , the @entity160 of @entity161 ? we will probably never know			0
to return to the question of what will the finding of @entity2 's remains mean ? let us hope it means more clear thinking , a wider debate , greater seeking of the truth and above all , may it set the record straight for @entity172 !			1

remains of a man matching @entity2 's *description* were found in @entity12 last *august*
*scientists* say *dna* tests show " beyond *reasonable* doubt " that the bones are the monarch 's
*supporters* of @entity2 hope the finding of his remains will open up debate about the king
*dr.* @entity190 writes that the @entity8 representation of @entity2 " just does n't stand up "
