editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity9 ) -- in april this year i embedded with the elite soldiers of the 2nd @entity23 at their training facility in @entity25 , @entity26			1
we went there to film the @entity26 army 's much - talked - about , multimillion pound " replica @entity30 village			1
" the focus of the piece was to be on the younger members of the battalion			2
some of them are as young as 18 and only months away from their first visit to @entity40 in september 2010			2
the majority of @entity26 casualties are all recorded in that area			1
i 'd heard about the @entity30 village training facility from an @entity45 turned photographer called @entity47			1
a couple of years ago , @entity5 published a photo essay in which he visited the homes of badly injured soldiers returned from @entity53 or @entity30			1
perhaps more shocking than the horrific injuries the soldiers had sustained was the lack of support of these men from the @entity26 government of the time -- particularly those who suffered psychological problems as a result of combat shock			1
@entity47 served his time in the @entity65 on tours of @entity67 in the late 80s to early 90s			0
but after being discharged he fell on hard times			0
he became homeless and spent a long time wandering the streets of @entity19			0
he slept in cardboard boxes in doorways , often coming across fellow army veterans who faced a similar lack of support and sympathy from society , the government or the army			1
happily , @entity47 managed to get himself off the streets and , inspired by the stories of his fellow homeless veterans , became a campaigner of sorts for veterans rights , using his photography			0
his story and those of other ex-paras is now available to watch in a moving @entity26 documentary called " isolation			1
" a week before we set off for the embed , i asked @entity47 what kind of experience we were letting ourselves in for and he said : " not only are the @entity95 's most elite soldiers , they are the most brutal of @entity26 troops			1
that means the rest of the @entity26 army are simply in awe of them			1
i would say around 90 per cent of the @entity104 ( the @entity26 equivalent of the @entity106 ) comes from the @entity65			1
and so the troops you are going to be sleeping next to every night are some of the hardest men in the world			1
" " recently what 's happened is that many former veterans have had a " call to arms " and returned to the forces again			0
life in @entity116 ( civilian ) street has been a huge disappointment for many of these guys			0
once you 've fought ' in - theater ' a number of times it 's really hard for you to come back and fit in with the hum - drum of modern life			0
especially if you 're a @entity129 they miss the camaraderie and the discipline and the action that you get when you 're in combat			0
" see the rest of @entity30 in the @entity26 at @entity9 " when @entity30 first kicked off , all three battalions of the @entity65 were sent straight there because of their reputation for violence and bravery			1
i remember it was in @entity40 2006 that @entity30 became very hairy indeed			1
the @entity23 were there when it became very intense and at the time a member of parliament called @entity143 was quoted as saying , ' i 'd be quite happy that a single shot is not fired in @entity30			1
' in reality the @entity23 were firing off more rounds in @entity40 than the entire @entity148 war ! " grinning nervously , i asked him if there 's anything else i should know and he looked at me and said , " they all drink rivers of lager			0
" before we set off to meet the @entity65 , @entity47 introduced us to a young man named @entity158 who 'd been a private in the @entity160			0
@entity158 had a significant part of his brain blown out of his head by a mortar attack and was slowly rehabilitating himself at his home in a small town near @entity167			0
@entity158 talked to us about his love for the army and for war			1
the severe injuries to his brain did n't seem to change his love for army life one iota			2
the more we spoke to him , the more we knew we had to include him in our film			0
but first we had to go meet the @entity65			0
with the help of my co-producer @entity179 , we packed two small cameras into our bags and traveled to the middle of the @entity26 countryside to try and ingratiate ourselves with the most brutal soldiers in the whole of the @entity26 army			1
it all started off nice and civilized			0
we were met on the door by a dashing officer who arranged for a private to show us our room -- a basic little number in the middle of the barracks which , while not five star , would certainly meet our needs for the week			0
i remember feeling pretty pleased with ourselves that we 'd been given this amazing access , thinking we 'd have carte blanche to wander around and check out the comings and goings of the most elite units in the world			2
" ah , " we thought , " this should be an informative and relaxing few days in the countryside			2
i do n't know what we were worried about at all			0
" soon we were put in jeep , driven an hour - and - a - half away to a gloomy brick building in the middle of nowhere and told that the next time we slept in a bed would be in five days time			0
as we stepped out of the van about 200 @entity65 troops stared at us with eyes that said : " who are these wimps ? " the dark fell fast			2
a cold wind started blowing and i suddenly realized we 'd left all our warm clothes in the barracks miles away			0
then the sergeant major introduced himself and told us to get in line with the rest of the troops			2
and off we marched into the night .			0
