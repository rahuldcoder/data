-- you 'd think @entity2 and @entity3 would be sick of the sight of each other			1
but from the ashes of their record - breaking marathon match at @entity9 in 2010 -- officially the longest in tennis history -- an enduring " bromance " has blossomed			1
it had to , after the pair walked on court for a low - key first - round match in the men 's singles draw , limping off three days later after 11 hours of tennis , battered , bruised , fatigued , but lauded as heroes the world over			1
even if either should go on to win a glut of major titles in their respective careers , it is entirely possible they will still forever be known for " the marathon match			1
" far from resenting the attention their epic encounter brought them , the pair are firm friends ; not surprising , given they are the only players on the planet to know just how much that eight - hour final set , which ended 70 - 68 in @entity2 's favour , can take from you			1
" i 'm actually really close with him , " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity37			1
" prior to that match , i knew him but it seemed in passing , i 'd give him a head nod , nothing more than that but from that match , i 've realized that he is one of the nicest , classiest guys on tour			1
" he actually is a really good friend of mine			0
we keep in touch all the time so we developed a friendship from that match , obviously sharing a court for three days			1
" @entity2 is now officially the highest ranked @entity53 in the world following @entity56 's retirement , but try as he might to move on from the marathon match it is almost always top of the list when tennis fans approach him			1
so what was it like to be involved in an episode that transfixed the world ? " yeah , it was crazy			1
i do n't think people will remember the fact that i won that match			1
i think it would be more the fact that we played it ... @entity3 , he was a warrior that day , " @entity2 said			1
" i do hear it all the time , it 's something that 's going to stick with me forever but i 've feel like i 've done some things out of that match			1
i 've broken the top 10			0
" i had a few marquee wins under my belt so i 've done some good things to try to shed that label but it 's up to me to keep doing more			0
" many expected a tight encounter , given the serving prowess of both players and @entity2 won that battle too , firing down 112 aces compared to @entity3 's 103			1
for a player who stands at 6 foot 9 inches , @entity2 's serve is undoubtedly the most powerful weapon in his armory			1
when it fires , few in the world can live with him , even in this golden age of @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
he has five @entity101 titles to his name , winning twice at the @entity104 and @entity105 events			0
last weekend he competed at @entity106 , where in 2012 he saw off world no. 1 @entity98 before losing to @entity96 in the final			2
on saturday he was beaten in his opening match by @entity111 veteran @entity110			2
" if i can get that opportunity where i can play those guys ranked in the top five of the world , that 's when i usually see myself raise my game , " @entity2 explains			1
" i like playing on those big stages and i think that 's one of the main reasons why i beat @entity96 , i beat @entity98 and i almost beat @entity122 at the @entity123 of all places			0
that 's why you play this game -- to get a crack at those guys , try to take it to them			2
" outside of my serve , i think my forehand is my best shot , " he added			0
" it 's no secret			0
my game is n't rocket science			0
the more aggressive i am , the better my results are going to be			0
" i have to be really aggressive with my forehand			0
something that i 'm constantly working on			0
i need to return better			0
if i can do that , i 'll see a lot more success but my serve is my weapon and that 's something that i rely on all the time			0
" but while that towering frame benefits his imposing serve , it can also hinder his movement around the court			0
no surprise then , that @entity2 invests a huge amount of training time on improving his on - court coverage			1
" i 'm always trying to work on my weaknesses which in the main part is my movement			0
i can improve that aspect. , " he said			0
" if i can improve my movement just a little bit , my game will improve a lot so other than that , my height certainly helps me with my serve first and foremost but it 's also a bit of a detriment when it comes to moving around the court			0
" " the game is pretty physical today where you see these guys running down balls			2
you ca n't hit a winner on some of these guys but for me , that 's not the case			2
" @entity2 may have found it difficult to shake off the " marathon man " tag but there are some other things that have stuck with him by his own choosing -- like his love for wrestling			1
the spectacle of @entity183 may not be to everyone 's tastes but @entity2 and his friends still gather round to watch it every week			1
" although it is scripted , i do have great respect for these guys			2
a lot of guys make fun of me but these guys are actually putting their bodies on the line , " he said			2
" growing up in @entity199 , me and all my friends , it was pretty sad but our weeks revolved around a monday night			0
" monday night wrestle would come on and we 'd all huddle up and pay per views would come on and i 'd get 10 of my friends to come over -- $ 5 each , so we could pay the $ 50 to watch the pay per view			2
" it 's something that i 've always liked and i have n't grown out of it either			0
you know , at 27 at 6 ft 10 ins , i have n't grown out of that stage so for me , it 's something i do to pass time on monday nights			0

" @entity214 men " @entity2 and @entity3 have forged close friendship
