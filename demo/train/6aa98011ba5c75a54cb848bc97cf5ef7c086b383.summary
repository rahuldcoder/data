-- the long - awaited remake of the 1970s cult classic " @entity3 " is finally seeing the light of day as it opens in theaters across @entity6 this weekend			1
the film stars season six " @entity9 " winner @entity8 and the late pop icon @entity10			1
it 's set in @entity12 during the 1960s and chronicles the rise and perils of an all - girl @entity17 group -- a la @entity18 and the glitzy 1981 @entity20 show " @entity21 " and its 2006 movie adaptation			1
the project has been a labor of love for producer @entity26 for more than a decade			1
she and @entity10 , her film producing partner , scored with " @entity33 " films and the made - for - tv movie , " @entity32			1
" as longtime fans of the original 1976 flick ( written by an upstart @entity38 ) , the duo yearned to bring it to a new audience			2
" just thinking back to why this movie was important to me as a teenager and i know why it was important to @entity10 ; it was really the first time we saw the fabulous women of color on the screen , who were glamorous , the men were gorgeous , the clothes were gorgeous , " @entity41 told @entity0 this week			1
" in and of itself , it was inspirational			2
" the @entity57 film , which has been virtually kept under lock and key from media for months , had showings this week in @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
it also stars @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , with appearances by @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
it 's hard to believe that it 's finally coming into fruition , " @entity41 said			1
" it 's like a lot of life lessons about believing in what you believe in and just sticking with your guns and just keep pushing forward to make it happen			1
" the road to post-production was n't an easy one for this new " @entity3			1
" in the late 1990s , @entity91 struck a three - picture deal with then - rising @entity17 star @entity93			1
one of the star - making vehicles was to be " @entity3 , " to which the studio owned the rights			1
under their @entity98 shingle , @entity41 and @entity10 were tapped to help bring the remake to life			0
but shortly after @entity93 's second film , " @entity101 , " wrapped , tragedy struck when the singer died in a plane crash			1
the project languished for years			1
" i took the idea to other studios and got a bunch of nos , " @entity41 said			0
" i never gave up on it			0
" the names of singer / actresses such as @entity114 and @entity115 were bandied about at one time or another , but nothing materialized			0
during a dinner a few years ago at @entity123 chairman @entity122 's home , the idea of " @entity3 " once again came up			1
unbeknown to @entity41 , it was a " passion project " for the studio chief , too			0
from there , the remake received the green light			1
on the heels of the success of their 2010 feature film debut , " @entity137 , " husband - and - wife creative team @entity129 and @entity130 -- already established forces in the television industry -- were tapped to direct and write the new movie			1
redefining what it means to ' @entity3 ' @entity129 had his trepidation about taking on such a storied work			0
the original -- which featured a timeless score and soundtrack by @entity146 -- made stars out of @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			0
the legend of " @entity3 , " which predated the fabled musical " dreamgirls , " would be a prized staple in black movie lovers ' collections for years to come			1
" i think with having conversations with my wife , @entity159 , and riffing on ' well what if i did do it ? ' and ' i would do this , i would do that , ' i felt like it 's an opportunity to take us back to a time that was a little bit more innocent in terms of the way that we approached life back then , " @entity130 said			1
" i thought 1968 was an interesting year for @entity6 , and so i thought we could do something and present something that a younger generation could appreciate it			0
" outside of the relatively small $ 15 million production budget ( period movies usually start at around $ 50 million ) and a marathon 30 - day shooting schedule , casting was one of the biggest challenges for the new " @entity3			1
" @entity130 said he knew off the cuff he wanted to work with @entity69 , a renowned comedian , again after " @entity137			0
" and as far as the leading role , @entity8 -- who starred in @entity20 's " @entity187 " in 2010 -- was a born natural			1
" @entity8 just has this quality about her that lends itself to innocence , and i needed that for ' sparkle , ' " he said			0
" i needed someone who , in this day and age , there was some innocence left			0
i wanted someone who was sort of ( a ) mystery to the public and who can sing her ass off , and she could definitely could do that			0
" however , the role of @entity3 's eldest , wilder sibling , @entity201 , proved less obvious once @entity202 , also in the @entity203 ' " @entity137 , " could n't do it because of a previous commitment			1
the director said he saw just about everybody in @entity208 to portray , what is arguably , the strongest role in the movie			1
and then a screen test of @entity214 , in full character , came his way			0
" she had taped herself and it just blew everyone away , and i remember when i saw it , i sent a text to everyone that said : ' this is @entity201			0
she is @entity201 ' and in a lot of ways , you get what you need through blessings like that			0
i think she knocked it out of the park			0
" as far as the creative process , @entity130 left his wife to her own devices			0
" i gave her five points that i would like to see and then i left her alone			0
@entity159 is a competent writer			0
i wanted her to write the movie because i knew she would do a great script , " he said			0
" and even though she wanted me to read the script before she was finished , i would n't because i did n't want to interfere with her process			1
" some central plot points are different from the original film , but it is a remake in every sense of the term , according to @entity41			1
" we 've made some changes			0
and with approaching a remake , you want to preserve that which is most beloved about the original and you want to adapt it to a modern audience , " she said			2
" but at its heart , it 's very much a remake			2
we 've stayed true to the essence and basic plot of the original movie			0
" outside the usual marketing push , the movie is making an impact in two other arenas : publishing and music			0
on august 7 , @entity266 released a novelization of " @entity3 " by best - selling author and journalist @entity268			2
" it 's a traditional triumph story and we knew that it would resonate with the audience similar to the movie , " book editor @entity270 said			2
" it had all the properties of love and lost			0
the product is a tremendous story , and in terms of publishing , that 's what we 're all about			2
" last month , @entity283 released the original motion picture soundtrack featuring music from the movie produced by @entity287 , @entity288 and the @entity289 and featuring what is believed to be @entity10 's final recordings			2
early buzz on the movie has been good , and seeing @entity10 , whose role of the matriarch was originated by veteran actress @entity297 , in her final movie role is expected to draw her fans			0
" i 'm excited , i 'm not nervous , " @entity129 said			2
" i think when i feel like i 've done my job and i 've respected the audience and respected the material , there 's no reason to be nervous			2
i do n't read reviews so i do n't go down that road			2
so i 'm just excited			2
i 'm excited for all of the actors			2
i 'm excited for people to see @entity10			2
i want them to see her , how beautiful she is and what a wonderful actress she is			0
this is the closest i think i 'll come to giving birth			0
" ' " @entity3 " will be shown on more than 2,600 screens , @entity41 said , which is considered a wide release			0
most films catering to @entity318 audiences average between 1,500 and 2,000 theaters			1
" we still live in an age where we do n't have enough stories really dealing with @entity318 - @entity318 women , and dealing with their tensions and their conflicts , " said black film historian and author @entity320 , who chronicled the original " @entity3 " and many other films in his seminal tome " @entity324 : over 100 years of @entity6 's @entity330			1
" " we still need movies about @entity318 - @entity318 women and not just movies like ' the help , ' where it 's all about how they relate , basically , to white people			1
we need stories that are looking at @entity318 - @entity318 women and their particular conflicts and not just their romantic tensions but also their professional dilemmas , " he said			1
" i think with this new version of ' @entity3 , ' i think people are going to show up			0
they 've been waiting to see something like this			0
