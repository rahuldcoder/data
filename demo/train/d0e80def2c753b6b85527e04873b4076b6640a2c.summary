@entity0 -- in 2011 the @entity3 movie @entity4 depicted a pope struggling with his own conscience , who takes the outrageous decision of stepping down			2
the fact that this event took place monday in @entity12 went probably well beyond everyone 's imagination			0
pope @entity16 's resignation was unexpected and it struck @entity3 like a bolt out of the blue			1
the influence of what happens in the @entity21 on @entity3 is much stronger than on any other country in the world and it is due to both historical and geographic reasons			0

on monday , @entity3 's 10 - year government bond yields reached a new peak			2
can the @entity16 's resignation be considered responsible for that ? the answer seems to be negative , since an increasing trend , which has more to do with the uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming parliamentary elections , had been already observed during the past two weeks			1

votes from @entity50 believers seem to be distributed over the three main competitors ( @entity53 's @entity52 , @entity43 's @entity42 and @entity45 's coalition ) and uncertainty over their reactions might exacerbate the tones of the campaign , now in its two last weeks , since the three parties might be willing to appease as many @entity58 as possible			0
watch more : the @entity16 's @entity60 roots nevertheless , the @entity16 's resignation does not seem likely to bring about major consequences over the financial and economic situation of the country			1
in the short run , the forthcoming elections of the new successor of @entity68 will attract a huge number of pilgrims from all over the world			0
the tourism industry , one of the most important assets for the @entity3 economy , is not immune from the crisis and data recently released by the @entity79 show that the number of foreign visitors to @entity3 decreased , in the period january to october 2012 , by 6.2 % over the same period in 2011			1
@entity12 will soon get the unusual status of " city of the two popes " ( since @entity16 will still be living in the @entity85 , after a period in the detached @entity88 's residence ) and that might look appealing to foreign tourists			2
however religious tourism is generally characterized by big numbers but low expenditures : therefore , a revived wave of pilgrimages to @entity12 might not be enough to boost @entity3 tourism			1
whether the smoke coming out from @entity68 's chimney will be " white " or " black " for the @entity3 economic recovery is not immediately clear			0
this " inter-regnum " period will definitely increase uncertainty in the political competition , but not enough to again raise fear in global financial markets towards @entity3			0
