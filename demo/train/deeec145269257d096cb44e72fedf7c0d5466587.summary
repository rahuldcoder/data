-- a number of themes emerge from the regional reports included in the @entity4 -- things like risks to infrastructure due to rising oceans both benefits and harm to agricultural production because of changing temperature , and new realities for cooling and heating costs			1
find your geographic region below and see how these issues specifically affect where you live , according to the report			1
@entity20 if you live in the @entity21 , you can appreciate how vital the snow accumulation in the mountains is			1
it melts in spring to provide water for hydropower plants and irrigation for crops			1
but as seasonal water patterns change , caused in part by changes in snowmelt , the region 's diverse ecology and geography can face challenges			1
the impacts of climate change will be strongly felt along the coast -- an area important for the region 's economy			1
people 's livelihoods , recreational areas and infrastructure could be affected by rising sea levels			1
at the same time , wildfires are expected to increase			1
@entity49 : climate change is here , action needed now examples from report : -- " since around 1950 , area - averaged snowpack on april 1 in the @entity55 decreased about 20 % , spring snowmelt occurred 0 to 30 days earlier depending on location , late winter / early spring streamflow increases ranged from 0 % to greater than 20 % as a fraction of annual flow , and summer flow decreased 0 % to 15 % as a fraction of annual flow , with exceptions in smaller areas and shorter time periods			1
" -- as sea levels rise , coastal areas of @entity68 and @entity69 will flood more often			1
beaches and habitats will probably decline in these areas			1
-- " climate change will alter @entity21 forests by increasing wildfire risk and insect and tree disease outbreaks , and by forcing longer - term shifts in forest types and species			2
" -- wildfires are a natural part of the forest ecosystem in the @entity21 , but warmer and drier conditions have increased the number and extent of such fires			2
-- " projected warming will reduce the availability of irrigation water in snowmelt - fed basins and increase the probability of heat stress to field crops and tree fruit			2
" -- in the short term , some crops will benefit from a longer growing season , but the long - term consequences are uncertain			2
@entity101 those in the @entity101 , especially in @entity103 , have already seen what changes in sea levels and temperature can do			2
wildfires have ravaged some communities , and there has been damage along the coast due to waves encroaching further and further inland			2
residents in this region count on a reliable supply of water			2
imagine if that supply becomes less reliable as snowpack and streamflow amounts decrease ? examples from the report : -- " over the past 50 years across most of the @entity101 , there has been less late - winter precipitation falling as snow , earlier snowmelt , and earlier arrival of most of the year 's streamflow			2
" -- between 1970 and 2003 , warmer and drier conditions increased the burned area in the western @entity132 mid-elevation conifer forests by 650 %			1
-- the sea level along the @entity103 coast has risen anywhere between 6.7 to 7.9 inches over the past 100 years			2
-- " if adaptive action is not taken , coastal highways , bridges , and other transportation infrastructure ( such as the @entity140 and @entity141 airports ) are at increased risk of flooding with a 16 - inch rise in sea level in the next 50 years			1
" -- " the effects of heat stress are greatest during heat waves lasting several days or more , and heat waves are projected to increase in frequency , duration , and intensity , , , , , become more humid , and cause a greater number of deaths			2
" @entity155 a large chunk of the middle @entity132 , from @entity157 to @entity158 and the @entity159 , falls into this category in the report			1
what do @entity162 and @entity158 have in common when it comes to climate ? well , the entire region will see increased demand for water and energy , and temperatures rise			1
changes in how much you have to cool or warm your house has large impacts on the efficiency of energy use			1
five things you can do climate change does n't have just negative effects			2
for example , increased rainfall in the @entity155 could increase agricultural productivity			2
but in the @entity185 and @entity155 , declines in rainfall means crop yields will be reduced			2
examples from report : -- in the @entity155 , warmer winters mean that there may be a reduction in heating demand , but it might be outweighed by greater demand for air conditioning during warmer summers			0
-- in the @entity185 and @entity155 , " the climate impacts of shifting from irrigated to dryland agriculture would reduce crop yields by about a factor of two			0
" -- plants and animals adjust to rising temperatures by adjusting their ranges , but that is becoming more difficult			1
for example : " the historic bison herds migrated to adapt to climate , disturbance , and associated habitat variability , but modern land - use patterns , roads , agriculture , and structures inhibit similar large - scale migration			0
" -- @entity216 communities face physical and political constraints as the climate changes : " tribal members have reported the decline or disappearance of culturally important animal species , changes in the timing of cultural ceremonies due to earlier onset of spring , and the inability to locate certain types of ceremonial wild plants			0
" @entity229 the @entity229 is home to one of the country 's treasures , the @entity233			0
climate change , however , means that the ecosystem might see changes such as increased invasive species and harmful algae , and declining beach health			0
on the flipside , less ice on the lake could increase the shipping season			0
as in other regions , the growing season stands to be lengthened because of the climate change , but again , it risks being offset by extreme weather events such as freezes that ruin crops			1
examples from report : -- the @entity229 growing season lengthened by almost two weeks since 1950			0
-- the longer growing season can be offset by extreme weather , such as freezes and springtime cold outbreaks			0
-- the frequency of major heat waves in the @entity229 has increased over the past 60 years			0
-- " one study projected an increase of between 166 and 2,217 excess deaths per year from heat wave - related mortality in @entity263 alone by 2081 - 2100			0
" -- " the @entity233 , @entity265 's largest freshwater feature , have recently recorded higher water temperatures and less ice cover as a result of changes in regional climate			1
" @entity271 the @entity271 -- known for its beaches , its seafood and ports , and as home to two of the nation 's major cities -- @entity280 and @entity281 -- could face risks due to climate change			1
sea - level , rise , especially , can affect the region , as well as extreme weather such as hurricanes and heat spells			0
the risk is intensified in that so many cities , roads , energy facilities and water supplies are on the coast			1
opinion : wake up to the reality the hot weather is only going to get hotter , though the increases for this region are smaller than for some others			0
examples from report : -- @entity304 is raising the roadbed of @entity306 across the @entity307 on the coast by four feet , which includes 18 inches to allow for higher future sea levels			1
-- " @entity310 , heavily used for delivering critical oil and gas resources from @entity314 , is literally sinking , resulting in more frequent and more severe flooding during high tides and storms			0
" -- utilities will be under more pressure as rising seas means saltwater can contaminate freshwater supplies			1
-- the summer heat will continue to reduce crop productively and damage crops , as happened in @entity326 in 2007 , when a drought cost $ 339 million in losses			0
some of the country 's most important cities are categorized together in the climate report under the @entity334			0
the governmental and financial hubs of the @entity132 will have to withstand heat waves , downpours , and a rising sea level			1
the @entity334 is a highly - urbanized region , where the heat and other climate factors can take a toll on the population			0
already , there are examples of cities in this region incorporating the risk into their planning			0
industries such as agriculture and fishing will be tested , and farmers can choose to explore alternate crops , but this is not easy or cheap			0
examples from report : -- " one recent study projected that temperature changes alone would lead to a 50 % to 91 % increase in heat - related deaths in @entity361 by the 2080s			0
" -- do n't forget about rural areas			0
places where air conditioning is not prevalent because heat waves are rare suddenly become vulnerable when such heat events become more frequent			0
-- " in @entity368 , two feet of sea level rise is estimated ( absent adaptation investment ) to flood or render unusable 212 miles of roads , 77 miles of rail , 3,647 acres of airport facilities , and 539 acres of runways			0
" -- higher ocean temperatures mean that commercially important fish will be pushed northward			0
this means fisheries that depend on cod and lobster face significant declines .			0
