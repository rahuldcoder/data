@entity0 pleaded with his son not to volunteer			2
but there was nothing he says he could say to talk his 19 - year - old son out of joining @entity5 , which refers to itself as the @entity6 and is formerly known as the @entity5			2
" i do n't know what they told him , " @entity0 told @entity7 by telephone from his home in @entity10			1
" last week , my son came home and told me that he is leaving home and joining the @entity6			1
" and then , the teenager packed a bag and left			2
" we have heard nothing from him , " said @entity0 , who asked to be identified by his @entity20 nickname out of fear of retaliation by @entity5 for speaking out			2
his son is now believed to be one of hundreds of young @entity28 men who , two @entity30 senior defense officials tell @entity7 , have joined @entity5 in recent weeks in the @entity30 provinces of @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
analysts and @entity38 officials estimate @entity5 has as many as 10,000 fighters in @entity30 and @entity40 , including those who were freed from prisons by @entity5 and @entity28 loyalists who have joined the fight as the group advanced			1
but that number likely does n't include these latest recruits , mostly young men between the ages of 16 and 25 who are primarily poor , unemployed and lack an education , the two @entity30 senior defense officials told @entity7			1
add to that a disenfranchisement felt by @entity30 's @entity28 minority , who have bitterly complained of being marginalized and cut out of the political process by prime minister @entity56 's @entity55 - dominated government			1
the height of that disenfranchisement coincided with @entity5 routing @entity30 security forces in @entity10 , @entity30 's second - largest city , in june			0
@entity0 blames @entity56 's government for what happened with his son			0
" he allowed those ( @entity5 ) thugs " to take hold in the country , he said			0
@entity38 president @entity64 vowed on saturday to push @entity30 's lawmakers to create a more inclusive government that " can give confidence to populations in the @entity28 areas that ( @entity5 ) is not the only game in town			1
" but for now , at least in @entity10 , @entity5 is recruiting young men at a rapid pace , officials and residents told @entity7			1
" once they are in , ( @entity5 ) gives them cars to drive , guns , cell phones and cash money , " said one man , who lives in @entity10 and has direct knowledge of @entity5 recruit efforts			0
in @entity10 , for example , @entity5 recruiting efforts appear to begin at information centers that have been set up around the city			0
pictures of the centers posted online purportedly by @entity5 claim to show militants , many dressed head - to - toe in black , distributing leaflets , videos and cds about their operations to men and boys			1
while @entity7 can not confirm the authenticity of the pictures , they appear to coincide with descriptions provided by the man who described @entity5 recruiting efforts			1
the pictures also show men and young boys gathered in front of the centers , watching videos purporting to show @entity5 leader , @entity109 , on giant flat - screen televisions			1
in some of the videos , @entity111 is heavily armed			0
in others , he appears to be preaching at a pulpit			0
still other pictures appear to show videos about bomb - making and suicide bombs			0
at the centers , @entity5 encourages young men to join , according to a man who asked to be identified only as @entity121 out of fear of retaliation by @entity5 the actual recruiting occurs elsewhere , according to @entity121 , who lives in @entity10 and told @entity7 he has visited the centers			1
sometimes , he says , recruiting takes place at mosques			0
last week , the @entity30 air force targeted the @entity132 mosque in western @entity10			0
a senior security official in @entity134 and two residents told @entity7 that the mosque was being used by @entity5 as a recruitment center			1
@entity7 can not independently verify the claims			1
@entity0 ca n't pinpoint the moment that his son made the decision to leave his life behind for @entity5			2
before the militants swept into @entity10 , his son listened to music and played video games			0
" but then he became a different person			0
he stopped acting like a normal boy a few weeks ago , " @entity0 said			2
" my wife and i begged him not do it			0
but he did n't listen			2
" there are stories , @entity0 says , of young men who have been recruited by @entity5 and within weeks are carrying out suicide bombings			1
he wonders if one them will be his son			0
" my son dreamed of becoming a computer engineer , " @entity0 said , his voice breaking			0
" now he 's just a terrorist			0

hundreds of young @entity28 men have joined isis in recent weeks , officials tell @entity7
the recruits are *typically* between the ages of 16 and 25 , they say
" i do n't know what they told him , " says one father
