-- in 2001 , i became the first tenured female faculty member ever in @entity4 's physics department			0
throughout my 30 years as a physicist , being the only woman in the room has been the norm			0
women fill more than half of the jobs in the @entity13 economy but constitute fewer than 12 % of working physicists and engineers			1
for me and for others in @entity19 ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) , the dearth of women is not news			1
what was big news last week was a study , from colleagues in other departments at @entity4 , explaining why this deficiency of women persists			1
evidence shows that established scientists at top research universities -- those choosing and training the next generation of @entity19 experts -- unconsciously rate budding female scientists lower than men with identical credentials			1
they judge women less capable , less worthy of hiring and less deserving of mentoring			2
and they propose starting salaries that are on average 14 % higher for men than for women			1
are we really ready to take a look at ' real women ' ? the new study is the first to be done on @entity19 faculty rather than , as is more typical , college undergraduates			1
hundreds of earlier studies on undergraduates established that the name on a résumé affects our perceptions			2
and that women and men both act with unconscious bias to privilege those who already dominate a specific field of work , whether that means preferring a man 's résumé for a job in physics or a woman 's for a job in nursing			1
when i was a young scientist , the dearth of female colleagues bothered me			0
so did the general lack of concern this raised in the scientific community			0
occasionally , a colleague might ask why there were n't more women in physics , but their favorite hypothesis did n't hold water : that family priorities are to blame , because the years raising children often coincide with the crucial years as an assistant professor right before getting tenure			1
but if family considerations slowed the advancement of women , why would women without children have similar career trajectories to those with children who remained full - time in the work force ? it did n't add up			1
i also struggled to understand why i did n't seem to belong in my field -- why i was overlooked for leadership roles , why i was underpaid , why my suggestions were ignored until a male colleague proposed the same idea and why female scientists in general garnered a disproportionately small share of honors and awards			1
then i stumbled on a description about bias in @entity108 's eye - opening book , " @entity109 ? the @entity110			2
" it was a classic @entity112 moment			0
my observations of the underappreciation of women in science were suddenly explained by a simple idea : that each of us , having grown up in a society where men and women are not equal and do not populate the peaks of accomplishment equally , has an unconscious expectation that men are leaders			1
consider this riddle i heard as a kid : a man and his son are in a serious car accident			0
the man dies on the spot , and the son is rushed to the hospital			0
upon entering the operating room , the surgeon says , " i ca n't operate on this boy ; he 's my son			1
" i was utterly unable to figure out how the boy 's father could both be dead and about to perform surgery			0
of course , the answer is that the boy 's mother was the surgeon			0
that possibility never crossed my young mind because , until i was in my 20s , i had never had a female doctor			0
so it 's not surprising that i developed an unconscious expectation that doctors would be men			1
opinion : lift up women to lift the world the social science research made all kinds of sense to me			1
our experiences of life are turned into unconscious expectations that affect how we see others			2
when scholars reviewed a psychology research paper , for example , they scored it higher if the author 's name were male than if female			0
a male applicant for a job as police chief was rated higher than a woman , even though she had important qualifications for the job that he lacked			0
similarly , a male applicant for a job as nursing supervisor was rated lower than the female applicant , even when he had the qualifications she lacked			0
these experiments , which vary only the name at the top of the résumé , are repeatable			0
time after time , the results are the same			0
perhaps the biggest worry is that people who swear they are objective are the most likely to make biased judgments			2
in several classic experiments , subjects were asked which criteria are most important for a particular job and then shown two résumés : one of the " wrong " gender who had all those qualifications and one of the " right " gender who lacked them			2
yet the subjects rated the person with the " right " gender higher , i.e. they ignored the criteria they had earlier said were most important			2
and this tendency was greatest among those claiming objectivity			0
those who admitted at the outset that they were not objective were the least likely to shift criteria because of gender			2
it seems like people who are aware of the unconscious biases we all carry are less likely to make judgments influenced by that bias			1
you can even check out your own objectivity on a website : @entity222			0
it 's a sobering experience			0
mine is probably typical : i so deeply wanted to be unbiased , but while taking the online tests , i felt the impact of gender and race on my reactions			2
@entity231 , the @entity232 professor who started the website , says she too showed signs of bias when she took her own test			0
if she can admit that , perhaps the rest of us can be open to the possibility			0
opinion : why do women still lag in journalism ? objectivity is the core value in science			1
we are trained to be objective ; to be a good scientist is to be objective			0
any suggestion that a scientist is biased can be a serious insult			2
but as the new study tells us , despite our best hopes , we scientists , like everyone else , expect men to be better scientists than women , and we project those expectations on the real people we encounter , not consciously and not meaning to discriminate yet evaluating women below their demonstrated potential			1
this means most of us ca n't be gender - blind or color - blind or unaware of difference			1
that 's not the goal right now			0
what we must do is acknowledge our inner biases and make sure we try our best to avoid them			1
maybe then it will become possible for bright young women to move forward in @entity19 careers as easily as the men do , making discoveries , improving our lives , changing our preconceptions and reducing our unconscious biases			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity279 .			1

a new study shows established scientists are biased against women in science
@entity279 : most of us have unconscious expectation that men are leaders
she says we ca n't be gender - blind or color - blind , even when we think we are
@entity279 : we must acknowledge our inner biases and try our best to avoid them
