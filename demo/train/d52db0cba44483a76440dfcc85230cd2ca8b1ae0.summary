@entity0 is associate professor of politics and african - american studies at @entity3			1
she is the author of the award - winning book " @entity6 , and @entity7 : @entity10 and @entity11 " and writes a daily blog titled @entity9			2
@entity0 says african - americans remain skeptical about racial progress in the @entity14 @entity15 , @entity16 ( @entity17 ) -- @entity14 was proud of itself for electing @entity19			1
the pride was not just partisan and ideological ; it was also specifically and clearly racial			2
the morning after @entity19 's win , the @entity21 declared " @entity23 in @entity24			1
" the @entity25 asserted that " for the first time in human history , a largely white nation has elected a black man to be its paramount leader			0
" some black commentators openly wept on election night , thrilled with witnessing the election of our first black president			2
even sen. @entity37 , conceding defeat , pointed to the greatness of the @entity40 promise fulfilled in the election of his opponent			2
@entity19 's victory offered the possibility that the scars of @entity14 's racial legacy were healed or , at least , that they were less raw			1
for many @entity40 - @entity40 citizens , the election of the first black @entity14 president was cause for celebration and open - mouthed wonder about an outcome that seemed so unlikely just two years earlier , when @entity19 announced his bid			1
despite this joy , many black citizens were dubious that his victory represented the destruction of any particular racial barrier			1
african - americans were both proud of and excited about @entity19 , but in the 45 years since the passage of the @entity63 , black @entity40 had seen doors to power , influence and wealth open just enough to admit just a few without fundamentally altering opportunities for the majority			1
indeed , responses to a recent @entity17 / @entity72 survey indicate that black enthusiasm about @entity19 exists side - by - by side with deep skepticism about @entity14 's racial progress			1
this atmosphere of both enthusiasm and doubt has sparked discussion about whether we have entered a post-racial era in @entity40 politics			2
it is a difficult debate , because the term " post-racial " is not clearly defined			0
race itself is a slippery idea			2
typically , we treat race like a fixed , unchanging , biological category			2
but race is none of these things			2
race is a social construct			2
though it is based in physical traits , race is a category developed through social practice , law and history			2
as a nation , we made blackness through our politics , developing a category of people who could be enslaved and later segregated			2
so when we talk of a post-racial @entity14 , we are not pointing to the massive demographic shifts that are unalterably changing the racial , ethnic and linguistic landscape of @entity14			2
instead , " post-racial " is an expression of social and political longing			0
for most , this means an @entity14 free of racism and discrimination , but others seem to hint at a society entirely free of racial identity or recognition			2
the idea of a post-racial @entity14 has been upheld as an achievable ideal where people would receive equal treatment and fair outcomes regardless of their race			2
it has been critiqued as an impossible dream unlikely to exist in a nation with a history of slavery and legal discrimination			0
it has been denounced as an unworthy goal that would require black @entity40 to reject their cultural specificity and unique social and political concerns			0
undoubtedly , the 2008 election broke formerly entrenched racial trends			1
@entity19 was elected just as the depth and breadth of the @entity40 economic crisis was becoming clear			1
some suggested that his victory could be explained by the nation 's fiscal difficulties because he was the candidate of the out - party , which often wins when times are hard			1
but this analysis forgets the cross-cutting history of race			0
when the economic pie shrinks , @entity40 rarely form multiracial political coalitions led by minority candidates			0
@entity19 's victory countered the trend toward racial balkanization more typical in tough economic times			1
the changing dynamics of racial politics were further evidenced when @entity19 won both @entity161 and @entity162			1
in these @entity163 and in many blue states throughout the country , @entity19 shattered the " @entity166 , " often getting a higher percentage of the white vote than polls predicted			1
there was little evidence that white voters rejected @entity19 based on his race , and few white @entity174 crossed party lines to vote for @entity37			1
for these reasons , @entity19 's win offers evidence of a post-racial @entity40 electoral politics			1
and if not post-racial , these data at least point to a much less racist @entity40 voting public than what existed 40 years ago			0
still , the election of a black president has not changed the material realities of racial inequality			1
african - americans are significantly more distressed than their white counterparts on every meaningful economic indicator : income , unemployment , wealth , education , home ownership and home foreclosures			0
@entity40 social realities are equally grim			0
blacks are far more likely to be arrested and more harshly sentenced than whites			0
african - americans are less likely to marry , more likely to divorce and more likely to live in single - parent households			0
compared with whites , blacks are more likely to suffer infant mortality , cancer , diabetes and premature death			0
substantial evidence shows that the economic , social and even political gains made by @entity40 in the 1960s and 1970s have leveled off or reversed in the past decade in areas such as urban education , the number of black elected officials and the racial wealth gap			1
the murder of a security guard at the national @entity220 museum by a racist anti-semite reminded the nation that old - fashioned , violent bigotry still has life in @entity14			0
these sobering realities indicate that race still vastly over-determines the life chances of @entity40			0
these differences can not be explained away by class alone , because most of these inequalities persist even when controlling for income			0
to be born black in @entity14 is still a tremendous disadvantage compared with being born white in this country			0
herein lies the challenge facing @entity40 in this new racial era			0
for much of the 20th century , the battle for civil rights rested on a belief that political equality would translate into social and economic justice			0
there can be little doubt that many of the substantive battles for political power and representation have been won			0
in that sense , @entity19 's election is the fulfillment of a post-racial political promise			1
it is equally clear that this political arrival has not ushered in the other substantive racial changes that the civil rights movement hoped to achieve			0
in many ways , political equality is just the beginning of the process			0
the work of politics is to collectively craft the nation we want to have			0
the election of @entity19 does not indicate the realization of post-racial @entity14 , but it does allow us the opportunity to engage in renewed , collective questioning of what a racially just nation is like			1
having achieved so much politically , there is still real debate about how to end overt racism , structural discrimination and persistent inequality			0
some want a country where the black kids do n't sit together in the cafeteria , while others hope black kids being together will provoke neither comment nor anxiety			0
some want a nation where no one notices race , while others hope that their racial identity can be both recognized and appreciated			1
some worry that eliminating racial barriers will only solidify economic differences , while others suspect that economic justice can not be achieved without grappling with race			1
some want the end of all inequality , while others simply hope disparities will be based on " merit " rather than race			0
as citizens in a democracy , we can choose the future of our racial politics			1
not all at once and not without struggle , but we can make new choices and this time , @entity40 - @entity40 participate in the process of remaking @entity14 's racial story from a very different position than we have occupied in the past			1
rather than being solely on the margins of national power , black @entity40 , through the person of @entity19 , have achieved a new kind of citizenship more empowered to recreate @entity40 race			1
this does not mean black people have equal political or economic power , but it does mean that the election of @entity19 encourages black @entity40 to even more loudly and clearly articulate our varied aspirations for our country			1
in november , we did a marvelous thing			0
now , the work begins			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			1

@entity0 : @entity19 's election celebrated as racial triumph
she says it represented real progress in the arena of politics
@entity341 - @entity0 : in many other areas , issues of race remain significant
