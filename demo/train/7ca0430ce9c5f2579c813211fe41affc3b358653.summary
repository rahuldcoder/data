once known as the deadliest city in the world , the @entity1 border city of @entity2 deserves a new nickname			1
the city -- infamous for tales of unsolved murders and gangland shootings -- recorded 750 homicides in 2012 , a significant drop from the previous year when 2,086 people were killed			0
statistics from the @entity15 state attorney general 's office show that @entity2 ended 2012 with the fewest killings the city has seen since drug - related violence encapsulated it five years ago			1
opinions differ on why the homicide rate has dropped so quickly , but one thing is clear : @entity2 is now a city where residents feel safe enough to walk the streets and go out with a relative sense of safety			1
" there is no superman , or one person that did all the changes , " said @entity26 , president of the bureau of public safety in @entity2			1
" it was a multifunctional process			0
" between 2007 and 2011 more than 9,000 people were killed , with the peak coming in 2010 , when @entity2 saw a record 3,116 homicides , or about 8 murders per day , according to figures released by the attorney general 's office			1
no single factor is responsible for restoring relative tranquility , but a key factor was that for the first time there was a team effort and coordination between local police and civil society organizations , @entity26 said			0
" the players [ that helped bring down the violence ] have also been leaders of the local police and the politicians , " he said , referring to new government administrations that came to power during this period			0
in 2010 mayor @entity58 took the reins from mayor @entity60 , and the state of @entity15 also got a new governor			0
the withdrawal of federal agents -- often accused of corruption -- in 2011 also brought relative calm to @entity2 , @entity26 said			1
at the same time , the municipal police received better equipment and salaries under new police chief @entity70			0
the drop in violence is reflected in the city 's economic growth , @entity58 said			1
at least three new high schools and sports facilities opened in 2012 , and hundreds of businesses -- including restaurants , nightclubs and grocery stores -- reopened throughout the city , @entity58 said			0
the growth was supplemented by funds earmarked by the administration of former @entity1 president @entity85 , he said			0
murguia credits law enforcement , security specialists and " no one else " for the changes in @entity2			2
but the sentiment among many @entity2 residents is more cynical			2
they say that the bloody turf war between the @entity95 and the @entity2 cartel that was responsible for the carnage has been won by the @entity98 , led by the world 's most wanted drug lord , @entity99 " @entity101			1
@entity15 state prosecutor @entity102 disputed that view , saying that the most important factor in 2012 was the arrests of the heads of local criminal groups , including " @entity108 , " the head of @entity110 , the armed wing of the @entity2 cartel			2
since october 2010 , there were at least 4,000 arrests , including the detention of 250 kidnappers and 200 extortionists , as well as the seizure of 2,500 guns , @entity111 said			0
the strides made to improve security in @entity2 are noticeable , but the city 's homicide rate is still twice as much as it was five years ago			1
in 2007 , there was an average of about 0.82 murders per day			2
in 2012 , there were two murders per day , according to the attorney general 's office .			0
