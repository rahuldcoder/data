@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 separatist group @entity3 released a cease - fire statement sunday to various media , including the @entity4 newspaper @entity7 , where it typically releases information			1
@entity3 has announced cease - fires before and broken them , notably the unilateral 2006 cease - fire that was announced as " permanent , " only to be broken months later with a car bomb at @entity0 's airport that killed two people			1
in a statement published on the @entity7 website on sunday , @entity3 --- which is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for @entity4 independence in northern @entity1 and southwest @entity20 -- calls on the @entity1 government to " agree to the minimum democratic solutions necessary to start a democratic process			1
" officials at @entity1 's @entity25 said the cease - fire announcement was being studied cautiously but that no senior officials were due to speak publicly about it , @entity2 affiliate @entity2 + reported			1
the prime minister 's office told @entity2 it had no comment			1
the latest cease - fire announcement was not unexpected , following weeks of calls for a new peace process by some smaller leftist @entity4 political parties			2
the cease - fire announcement also follows months of what is widely regarded as a successful police crackdown against @entity3 operatives in @entity1 and also in @entity3 's hideouts in neighboring @entity20 and @entity40			1
police have arrested many of @entity3 's suspected top operatives , as well as many @entity3 foot soliders , and seized bomb - making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches , virtually shutting off @entity3 attacks			0
in its cease - fire announcement sunday , @entity3 said that " months ago it decided not to carry out armed offensive actions , " but made no mention of what it might consider a " defensive " action			1
the announcement was accompanied an @entity3 video which showed three apparent @entity3 members seated at a table in front of an @entity3 banner and facing a camera			0
they wore white face hoods with eye holes but their mouths covered , black berets and black jerseys			0
the person in the middle apeared to do all the speaking in the ancient @entity4 language -- not in @entity1 -- and the voice seemed to be that of a woman			0
@entity3 is listed as a terrorist group by the @entity76 and the @entity77 for its campaign of car bombings and shootings			0
the @entity1 government of prime minister @entity82 began a peace process in 2006 during the last unilateral @entity3 cease - fire , but after @entity3 's airport bomb , the government called off negotiations			1
since then , officials of @entity82 's government have said they would accept only a definitive statement from @entity3 to end its armed fight , and to announce when and where it would lay down its arms forever , and not simply a cease - fire			1
only then would the government be willing to consider leniency for some of the more than 500 @entity3 prisoners in jail			0
the @entity4 region in northern @entity1 already has considerable home - rule authority , with its own police , parliament , taxing power and control of health and education			0
but @entity3 rejects those as partial steps , and has fought for full independence			0
@entity3 's goal is an independent @entity4 nation comprising the three - province @entity4 region and the neighboring @entity113 region in @entity1 , along with three departments in southwest @entity20 that also have @entity4 roots			0
about three million people live in those areas now			0
@entity3 's cease - fire statement called on the international community to get involved in the @entity4 peace process			2
on sunday , the leader of the @entity122 in @entity123 said he supported the cease - fire			2
" @entity128 has welcomed @entity3 cease - fire announcement , " the @entity122 party said on its @entity127 page .			2
