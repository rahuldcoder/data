@entity0 -- i 've been to @entity3 many times in my career , but nothing could have prepared me for a trip that would turn into this moment			2
as the energetic crowd of @entity3 and numerous world leaders surrounded me tuesday inside @entity0 's @entity11 , i wanted to minister through song and lift my heart toward the memory of @entity16			1
but just days before , i would have never thought i 'd be there , performing in the rain , participating in history			2
it was a moment i 'll never forget			2
about six months ago , my team booked me for a run in @entity3			2
we were scheduled to hit @entity0 , @entity24 and @entity25			0
i was very excited to come minister to the people of @entity3 and as soon as i landed on thursday , i became so grateful to be in the presence of these amazing people within this beautiful country			0
upon arriving at the hotel , i sat glued to the tv as the news broke of the passing of @entity3 's favorite son and global role model			1
not wanting to miss an opportunity to embrace a culture most african - americans never experience , i asked to go to @entity16 's home in @entity0			1
as i arrived , there was a huge crowd outside			0
i stood in the streets and danced with my people , hugged my people and tried my best to embrace their loss			0
honestly , i wish i could have learned more about him when i was younger			0
i wish that i was more familiar with how it felt when @entity16 was released from prison when i was 24			1
i could have learned a lot more about forgiveness			0
for only a heart modeled after @entity55 's hands could embrace the same hands that embarked pain			1
so standing in the rain today , preparing to perform right before the @entity59 addressed the world , i took a deep breath , said a prayer and reminded myself " this is not about me			0
" this is for all of the men and women who 've passed on and never saw this dream come true for their homeland			0
i imagined them embracing him , the souls of the beaten , the hurt and the martyrs who finished their race before @entity16 's and welcomed him home like a proud soldier			1
my mom is there in that number as well , and i hope that i , too , made her proud today			0
my 13 - year - old son wants me to teach him everything about @entity16 when i come home			1
he better get ready , because his dad has now been to class ! i pray my presence on stage today will reflect the love i have for this country			0
i know their struggle , but i also know that they will have victory as long as they embrace the heart of their hero			1
