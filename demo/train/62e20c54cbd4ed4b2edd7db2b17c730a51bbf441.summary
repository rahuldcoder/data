editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1

@entity2 says issue of @entity13 's birth certificate is being pushed by conspiracy theorists			1
( @entity15 ) -- the @entity17 video of an out - of - control woman yelling and screaming at @entity21 congressman @entity20 's town hall meeting in @entity22 , demanding to see the birth certificate of president @entity13 , is utterly hilarious			1
to watch others cheer her insanity , and then boo the congressman who says the president is an @entity8 , shows you that we have a serious problem with mental illness in this country			2
the nut jobs that continue to promote this story are wacky , right - wing radio and tv talk shows hosts and no - credibility bloggers			0
they have latched onto this story like bloodsucking leeches , and actually want us to believe this story has legs			0
last week , in a suit filed by perennial presidential loser , @entity47 , they even tried to claim a court victory after a federal district judge in @entity50 asked to listen to the merits of their case			0
i 'm sure he simply wanted to see for himself how delusional they are			0
from the moment president @entity13 entered the race , he has had to endure the so - called flag - waving @entity8 patriots who think they are the arbiters of what 's right for the country			1
what cracks me up is that in order to justify their loony beliefs , they say , " the president could just end this once and for all by producing the birth certificate			1
" do you actually believe these wackos will stop there ? they will then accuse the president of doctoring the document and ordering up the state of @entity78 and federal officials to create the birth certificate			1
the next thing you know , one of those nut job right - wingers in @entity85 -- and yes , there are left - wing nut jobs as well -- will demand a federal investigation into the production of the birth certificate			1
during the presidential campaign last year , the issue of whether @entity13 was a " natural born citizen " legally qualified to be president was scrutinized by reporters and researchers who concluded that @entity13 was born in the @entity8			1
for example , in august , 2008 , factcheck.org published the following : " @entity99 staffers have now seen , touched , examined and photographed the original birth certificate			2
we conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the @entity104 for proving @entity8 citizenship			2
claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false			0
" president @entity13 is right to ignore these losers			2
they are right up there with @entity115 deniers like @entity116 , and the people who insist that the landing on the moon was done in a television studio			1
it 's just that today , we have to deal with the @entity124 and all the mess that is disseminated in the name of so - called transparency			0
so nut jobs , keep it coming			0
in such difficult times , we all need a good laugh every now and then , and you provide great comic fodder			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : conspiracy theorists are *focusing* on @entity13 's birth certificate
@entity2 says people who still think he was not born in @entity8 are like @entity115 deniers
over and over , he says , researchers , reporters find he was born in @entity8
@entity2 : @entity13 is right to ignore the wacky claims about his birth
