@entity0 stayed at home mostly , a witness said , playing video games such as " @entity4			1
" but on december 14 , 2012 , he went out -- armed with 10 30 - round magazines for his semiautomatic bushmaster .223 caliber model @entity7 rifle and bullets for his two handguns and a shotgun			1
@entity0 did n't make it home alive			1
nor did the 26 people -- 20 of them schoolchildren ages 6 and 7 -- he shot dead in less than five minutes , firing one bullet roughly every two seconds he was at @entity16			1
these were among the details spelled out thursday in five search warrants and other material tied to the grisly shooting at the @entity16 , @entity22 , school , as well as in a statement from a local top prosecutor			1

state 's attorney @entity35 of the judicial district of @entity37 , which includes @entity16 , stressed in his statement thursday : " this is an active , ongoing investigation			0
no conclusions have been reached , and no final determinations have been made			0
" at the same time , he acknowledged that the public -- including those intent on preventing other such massacres -- has an understandable , sincere desire to have information now			0

" even with its limited scope , he called thursday 's document release a step forward			0
" the information revealed today underscores the need to turn this tragedy into transformation , " @entity48 said			0
fresh insights into @entity63 , his home although the new documents do n't provide a motive , they offer fresh glimpses into the life of 20 - year - old @entity0 , in part by revealing what was inside the @entity16 home he shared with his mother , @entity73			1
one person , whose name was redacted in a search warrant , described @entity0 as a shut - in who rarely left home and played military - style video games			1
that house included a gun locker that investigators found open and without signs of a break - in , @entity35 said			1
all the guns tied to @entity0 appeared to have been purchased by his mother , he added			1
police also found more than 1,600 rounds of unspent ammunition inside the home , according to the documents			1
gov. @entity93 pointed out thursday the mass killer left lower - capacity magazines behind , a fact that , he said , speaks to the need to significantly restrict the number of bullets that can be in each magazine			1
he also said assault weapons should be banned			0
the @entity16 house also had three samurai swords and several books -- one titled " @entity105 to the @entity106 , " another about @entity108 's syndrome and a third on autism -- the newly released documents show			2

timeline of @entity16 shooting from there , he drove to the elementary school -- leaving a 12 - gauge shotgun in the car , police would discover -- and shot through the front entrance			1
the information detailed thursday dispelled some earlier reports on what happened , @entity35 noted			0
@entity0 was n't wearing a bulletproof vest , for one			2
and besides the hallway , he fatally shot students and teachers in two classrooms , not three			1
when police found @entity0 's body -- killed by a single , self - inflicted shot from a @entity177 10 mm handgun -- they also discovered that the bushmaster rifle was loaded with 14 bullets in its 30 - round capacity magazine , plus one round in a chamber			1
this was one of 10 of this firearm 's 30 - round capacity magazines at the scene , @entity35 explained			1
more ammunition for the @entity177 and a @entity190 9 mm handgun was also found			2
three such magazines still contained 30 rounds			1
there were six more magazines nearby -- three of them were empty , while the others had 10 , 11 or 13 live rounds in them			1
" one - hundred - and - fifty - four spent .223 casings were recovered from the scene , " the state 's attorney wrote , indicating that @entity0 had fired at least that many bullets from what @entity22 authorities had described as an " assault - type rifle			1
" a lot of bullets fired in not a lot of time			2
@entity35 said , " it is currently estimated that the time from when the shooter shot his way into the school until he took his own life was less than five minutes			2
" gun control push continues despite dwindling support the full investigation into the @entity16 shooting , @entity35 said , likely will be completed this summer			0
after that happens , the state 's attorney said he will write a report evaluating the crimes committed and whether or not anyone will be prosecuted as a result			0
until then , the debate over gun control stoked by the @entity16 massacre continues in earnest			0
@entity231 : ' shame on us ' if @entity16 does n't bring new gun laws recent polling shows public support for gun restrictions has declined since the shooting			0

@entity259 mayor @entity258 , the group 's co-founder , said in a statement : " we can not afford to wait for another tragedy			0
