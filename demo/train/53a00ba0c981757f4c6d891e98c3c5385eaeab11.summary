-- after months of talking about each other and their policies , the world finally gets to see @entity4 and @entity6 challenger @entity5 go toe - to - toe on the same stage in three televised debates ahead of the @entity10 election			1
unlike other countries , such as the @entity15 , where the prime minister must defend his policies under televised duress from the opposition nearly every week , face - to - face showdowns between the two men fighting for the @entity13 only happen every four years			2
and while debates rarely swing the outcome of an election , a gaffe -- or a silver - tongued swipe at the opposition -- under the bright lights can alter the perception of the two contenders , for better or worse			2
what 's the history of @entity10 presidential debates ? presidential debates are a relatively recent phenomenon			2
the first televised debate was between @entity6 @entity35 and @entity37 @entity36 , on black - and - white tv in 1960			1
more : presidential debates by the numbers many people listening on the radio to that first of four @entity43 debates thought @entity35 had won - but on live tv , a tan and youthful - looking @entity36 trounced a sweaty , haggard @entity35 ( who 'd recently suffered a staph infection ) in the appearance department			1
while @entity35 improved in later debates , @entity36 went on to win the election			1
there were no debates again until @entity54 took on @entity55 in 1976			0
since then , the @entity6 and @entity57 hopefuls have matched wits in a series of ( usually three ) debates every election year - and twice , in 1980 and 1992 , an independent candidate has joined the duo onstage			1
in 1980 , president @entity54 refused to take part in the first debate with @entity66 because @entity67 , an independent candidate , had been invited to take part			2
@entity54 's boycott led to a dramatic decline in the anticipated viewership for that debate			0
the second was cancelled , and @entity67 was wiped off the program for the third round several weeks later			0
what are the debates about ? in recent election cycles , the three debates have consisted of a domestic policy debate , a foreign policy debate , and a general debate in a town hall format , where members of the audience also offer up questions			1
vice presidential candidates also face off in a single debate in the run - up to the election			2
generally speaking , candidates are asked questions by a moderator , who in recent years has come from one of @entity10 's major broadcast news networks			0
candidates then have a set period of time for responses and rebuttals			0

tonight @entity4 will answer first , but @entity5 will have the final word			1
the dates and sites for the debates , which typically take place at universities across @entity10 , are chosen from a list of applicants by the non-partisan @entity112			0
do debates even matter to the public ? while the debates offer @entity5 and @entity4 a chance to expand on their views and rebut each other 's plans directly , experts say that the vast majority of @entity10 have already decided who they 're voting for along party lines			1
but although debates are n't typically seen as deciding an election 's outcome , there have been a few exceptions over time			0
@entity36 's telegenic dominance of @entity35 during the first televised debate helped swing momentum in the @entity37 's direction in 1960			1
in a 1980 debate , facing a barrage of assertions and accusations from incumbent @entity54 , @entity66 coolly replied with a smile : " there you go again			0
" his famous retort momentarily took the wind out of @entity54 's sails			0
after entering debate season behind in opinion polls , eventual winner @entity66 left the podium with the advantage over @entity54			2

in 2000 , cameras caught a visibly annoyed @entity154 sighing and shaking his head when @entity156 spoke			0
the clip was played over and over again and lampooned on television , to the point that " people began to project onto @entity154 a personality trait of just annoyance and irritation of people in general , " according to historian @entity165			0
a clear favorite before the debates , @entity154 lost his lead during the debate season			1
he eventually lost the controversial election after the @entity171 ruled in @entity156 's favor			0
are @entity5 and @entity4 any good at debating ? as mentioned above , @entity10 politics do n't involve many head - to - head debates between @entity6 and @entity57 , but both candidates are seen as more than competent debaters			1
@entity4 handled @entity6 @entity177 in all three contests four years ago , says debate coach @entity179 , staying on track in his arguments , showing poise , and refusing to take attacks on his policies personally			1
@entity4 's quick wit may have backfired on him during a 2008 @entity57 primary debate			1
he responded to @entity187 saying he was likeable with , " you 're likeable enough , @entity187			0
" the audience laughed , but many viewers saw the remark as a mean - spirited swipe			0
more : coach says @entity4 , @entity5 are top debaters @entity179 says despite @entity4 's reputation as a great orator , his debate performances have not lived up to the standards of his speeches - and that at times the president can be awkward and long - winded in his debate answers			1
@entity5 is currently the better - practiced of the two , having emerged victorious from a @entity6 primary season that featured nearly 20 debates			1
@entity179 says @entity5 is consistently solid , has great opening lines to questions , and has a firm grasp of the issues			2
more : inside debate prep with @entity5 's sparring partner @entity5 's biggest weakness , according to some experts , is that he often comes across as fake			1
@entity179 says @entity5 's broad smile and " thank yous " following heated answers make it seems like " he 's practicing his speeches , " not debating his opponent			2
are debates about great politics or great theater ? long stretches of presidential debates involve dry policy speeches , but it 's usually a single gaffe or clever one - liner that comes to define a debate in the annals of national memory			1
@entity66 was already the oldest president in history in 1984 , and when asked during a debate about whether age would be an issue for him , the 73 - year - old famously replied : " i will not make age an issue of this campaign			2
i am not going to exploit , for political purposes , my opponent 's youth and inexperience			0
" even @entity57 challenger @entity245 , then age 56 , had to laugh			0
more : @entity165 's top debate moments sometimes body language matters more than words in a debate			0
in 1992 , president @entity250 took a glance at his watch while an audience member was asking a question - a move that made @entity156 , whose re-election hopes were rapidly slipping away , seem uninterested in the concerns of the public			0
@entity177 sparked controversy when he referred to @entity4 as " that one " during the second 2008 presidential debate			1
at a dinner attended by both senators several days later , @entity4 joked that his first name was @entity264 for " that one , " according to the @entity265			2
vice presidents and their counterparts have delivered just as many memorable lines as their bosses have over the years			0
@entity272 's sharp " senator , you 're no @entity36 " reprimand of @entity6 vice presidential candidate @entity274 in 1988 remains one of the all - time greats -- along with @entity278 running mate @entity277 's " who am i ? why am i here ? " debate opener in 1992 , which drew guffaws from the audience			1
a bad enough gaffe can help derail your campaign long before the first primary votes are cast , as @entity6 @entity287 showed in late 2011			1
at a primary debate in @entity289 , @entity287 became the first candidate in history to say " oops " during a debate after forgetting the name of the third government agency he 'd pledged to cut			2
when pressed for an answer , @entity287 said : " the third agency of government i would do away with , the @entity300 , and , let 's see			0
the third one , i ca n't			0
" after the debate , @entity287 owned up to the gaffe as only a @entity305 governor could : " i 'm sure glad i had my boots on because i sure stepped in it out there			0

@entity4 , @entity5 to debate domestic and foreign policy over three debates
telegenic @entity36 *outshined* @entity35 in first debate in 1960
@entity5 emerged victorius from primary season that *included* nearly 20 debates
then - candidate @entity4 easily handled @entity6 @entity177 in 2008 debates
