-- as smartphones gradually take over @entity4 's mobile market , these devices are helping more people cross the " digital divide " by providing their first regular access to an internet experience that 's at least moderately usable			1
but : if you 're poor , nervous about your income or job security or have n't had much prior experience with technology , then crossing that divide can look about as dicey as the " @entity15 " from @entity16 and the @entity17			1
sure , you can try to get across , but there 's a good chance you 'll plunge to a horrible death on the rocks below if you miss a step or give the wrong answer to a bizarre unexpected question			0
being on the right side of the digital divide is and increasingly key quality of life concern			1
for many @entity4 , lack of reliable , easy access to the @entity30 limits their ability to connect with jobs , services , education , public safety resources , emergency assistance , health care , news , civic or political engagement , personal support networks and much more			2
being on the right side of the digital divide also means having wireless broadband service that 's fast and robust enough to support a decent user experience , a wide range of activities and use cases , and to withstand spikes in numbers of users and data traffic			1
increasingly this means having good internet access on the go , because in just a few years most @entity4 internet access will be mobile			1
recently @entity55 predicted that by 2015 , " more @entity4 internet users will access the internet through mobile devices than through pcs or other wireline devices			2
" @entity4 do n't necessarily need to turn to cell phone carriers to get mobile data service , but our other choices have big tradeoffs			2
@entity66 covers only small locations , which means you lose access if you 're truly on the go			0
@entity71 can cover large regions , but that technology seems to be losing out , @entity74 - style , to wireless carriers ' competing @entity76 technology			1
recognizing the opportunity ( and possible economic boost ) that ubiquitous wireless broadband access could provide , in february the @entity78 announced a @entity82			0
one goal of this initiative was to to " provide at least 98 % of @entity4 with access to @entity76 high - speed wireless			1
" however , that particular goal might be stalling			0
in september , @entity88 noted that some provisions of the @entity82 were rolled into the @entity90 -- the same legislation which president @entity92 urged @entity93 to pass in a news conference thursday			0
but the provision that would extend 4g coverage to 98 % of @entity4 is omitted from the current text of the @entity90			2
left to their own devices , wireless carriers tend to roll out faster networks mostly around major metro areas , concentrating coverage in areas where they can either serve the most people or make the most money			1
this means that communities and neighborhoods that are less densely populated , less wealthy or more remote tend to be the last to benefit from wireless network improvements			0
as author @entity111 observed : " the future is here			0
it 's just not evenly distributed yet			0
" meanwhile , @entity4 have been getting the hard sell to buy smartphones			2
indeed , in about a year ( or maybe longer , if the economic recovery continues to sputter ) most of the handsets in use in the @entity4 will be smartphones of some kind			0
unfortunately , those @entity4 who have been living on the wrong side of the digital divide so far face extra obstacles when they try to catch up via mobile technology			1
the way smartphones and their data service get sold in the @entity4 is likely to continue to leave these people even farther behind -- just when broad deployment of mobile internet access might help strengthen the nation 's economic recovery			2
the first -- and biggest -- problem is that most smartphones are pretty pricey			2
in addition to having a higher up - front cost , in the @entity4 it 's difficult to get a new high - performance smartphone without a two - year carrier contract that includes a steep early termination fee			1
the cost for those contracts typically is somewhere close to $ 90/month			1
for people who earn a working - class income or less , or who are concerned about their job security or prospects , committing to such a large monthly expense for two years represents a huge financial risk			2
as the recession has dragged on , no - contract phone plans have been getting more popular			1
as of a year ago , 32 % of all @entity4 mobile users had no - contract plans , and the trend has been that each year no - contract phones are getting a little more popular			1
among the major @entity4 carriers , only @entity156 and @entity157 have been making it fairly easy to get a smartphone on more consumer - friendly terms than a two - year contract			2
but if @entity166 's controversial acquisition of @entity156 eventually goes through , @entity156 's no - contract offerings could dwindle			2
meanwhile , @entity157 recently announced that it 's eliminating its one - year contracts			2
this is why many @entity4 of more limited means turn to discount and regional carriers -- several of whom are starting to market smartphones without a contract , typically on month - to - month or prepaid plans that cost in the range of $ 50 a month			1
however , most of these smartphones cost about $ 200 to $ 300 upfront -- again , not a reasonable expense for many consumers of modest means			2
it gets even harder to opt to spend an extra $ 100 or more for a smartphone while there are plenty of decent feature phones , which with lower - income and less - tech - savvy consumers already are comfortable , available for $ 0 - 70 upfront , with no - contract plans that cost $ 20 to $ 40 a month			1
for many @entity4 right now , saving that much money can easily override longer - term hopes for what they might want to get out of a phone			0
rollouts of faster 4g mobile networks only exacerbates the cost problem			1
@entity76 - capable phones typically cost more to buy , and their plans cost more , too			1
most phones in use and on the market in the @entity4 today can not operate on 4g networks			1
so if you want @entity204 you 'll probably have to shell out for a new and more expensive phone , and get a costlier new contract or plan			0
yes , there are a few bargain - basement , no - contract smartphones available , but these typically come with significant tradeoffs			1
for instance , the discount carrier @entity213 is selling a @entity217 @entity216 smartphone for $ 80 with a mail - in rebate that brings the costs down to about $ 55 , with data plans that start at $ 40			1
the catch ? that phone is small , slow , running an older version of @entity216 and @entity225 reviewers gave it pretty low marks			0
similarly @entity213 has received low grades for customer support			0
so if something goes wrong with this phone , you 'd probably be left mostly on your own to figure it out			0
of course , simply having a smartphone does n't mean you can use it well or benefit much from it			0
for many , making the leap from a feature phone to a smartphone entails a daunting , frustrating learning curve			0
even the @entity241 -- perhaps the most user - friendly smartphone interface of all -- is prone to weird glitches and mysterious problems , sometimes involving hard - to - pin - down conflicts involving installed apps or carrier - specific firmware issues			0
while older - model @entity241 can be purchased from retailers for $ 100 or less ( with contract ) , @entity216 seems destined to capture most of the low - cost smartphone market because so many manufacturers compete on that platform			1
the catch : the @entity216 operating system is still harder to learn than @entity257 's @entity256 platform			0
worse , when something goes wrong with an @entity216 device , it often takes a lot of online research to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it			0
this can be especially difficult stressful for users with limited computer - based internet access or prior technology experience			0
for instance , when my @entity216 phone recently refused to install apps , the fix for that problem for that problem involved tracking down and deleting an arcane file in a hidden directory of the @entity216 os. i had to connect my phone to my laptop to do this			0
and if i had n't previously rooted my phone ( to remove controls placed on it by my carrier ) , i may not have been able to fix this problem at all			0
what happens when that kind of problem befalls first - time , not especially tech - savvy smartphone owners , especially with cheap , low - end @entity216 handsets ? after trying and failing to fix it on their own , chances are they 'd resort to wiping and resetting the phone ( perhaps losing all of their data in the process ) , or simply getting a new phone			1
and at that point , they might be tempted to give up on the smartphone concept altogether			0
who could blame them ? but even though that might be a very rational decision in the short term ( they 'd get a phone that just works ) , the long - term cost is that they 'd remain on the wrong side of the digital divide -- and they might never fully realize how much opportunity they 're sacrificing			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity317 .			0

being on the right side of the digital divide is an increasingly quality of life concern
@entity76 - capable phones typically cost more to buy , and their plans cost more too
rollouts of faster 4g mobile networks only exacerbates the cost problem
