-- it 's getting harder to shock people with stats about income inequality			1
@entity5 know they live in a two - tier country -- one where the uber - super - ultra - rich are leaving the rest of us behind ; where , as @entity10 famously put it , 400 of the richest people control the same amount of wealth as 150 million others ; where , as president @entity18 said in a speech on wednesday , the " average ceo has gotten a raise of nearly 40 % since 2009 , but the average @entity5 earns less than he or she did in 1999			1
" " even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits , " the president said in his prepared remarks , " nearly all the income gains of the past ten years have continued to flow to the top 1 %			1
" 1 % , 2 % , red percent , blue percent			0
at a certain point , these numbers bounce off our foreheads			0
that 's why i found it particularly refreshing that @entity18 , however briefly , argued this week that @entity5 's growing income inequality is " morally wrong			1
" the fairness of the widening rich - poor gap , or the lack thereof , has been discussed far less than the number soup			0
yet it 's a crucial question -- perhaps the central question -- for @entity5 to consider			1
the fairness gap is the basis for a wide range of policies , from the tax code to education ; health care to the minimum wage			0
so is extreme inequality amoral ? to think this through , i called up four smart people -- @entity53 , a freelance philosopher and writer , and host of the ( wonderful ) @entity58 podcast ; @entity59 , president of the @entity60 and author of " @entity62 " ; @entity63 , director of the @entity65 at @entity66 ; and @entity67 , researcher at the @entity68			1
each offered a range of interesting and nuanced views			0
but to make this column as un-wonky as possible , i 've broken down their arguments into a few , ( hopefully ) easy - to - chew - on talking points you can use to fight about inequality with your friends			2
bring these up at your next dinner party and let me know how it goes			0
inequality is n't a moral problem ; opportunity is in this school of thought , it does n't matter if the mayor of @entity89 is worth $ 27 billion ( he is ) as long as everyone in the city has an equal chance to succeed			1
that 's the view of @entity59 , from the @entity60			2
i asked him about that city , which is more unequal than any other metro in the @entity5 " the truth is there are a lot of really , really wealthy people there			1
great ! that 's a morally neutral concept , " he said			1
but not all of them have an equal opportunity at success , he said , in part because schools do n't perform well in all neighborhoods			2
( check out this wild map that shows the chances a kid at the bottom of the income ladder would have of climbing to the top			2
in @entity121 , where i live , a kid in the bottom fifth of income earners has only a 4 % chance -- 4 % ! -- of making it into the top fifth of income earners			2
) fix economic mobility , @entity59 said , not inequality			2
and let the rich do their thing			0
inequality turns us into ' @entity133 ' this is n't just about income ; it 's about class - based psychology			1
extreme income inequality , even if it 's derived from a fair playing field , can lead to a society where the rich look down their noses at the poor and essentially force them into positions of servitude , a la " @entity133			1
" " it undermines the social fabric , " said @entity63 , the @entity66 professor			0
he told me this idea comes from a @entity150 philosopher , @entity149			0
" it basically creates a multi-class society -- a society in which you have people who have to flatter and endear themselves and have to be servile			0
" wealth is rad ; human suffering is n't imagine a society in which the poorest people are very solidly middle - class by today 's standards			1
they have enough to eat ; they have jobs that are stimulating and thought - provoking ; they have comfortable lives and can afford to go to movies and all that			0
meanwhile , some people are extraordinarily rich -- like way richer than @entity170 or @entity171			0
is that fair ? is it moral ? yes , said @entity67 , the @entity68 researcher			0
eliminating suffering is what matters most			0
beyond that , extreme wealth is an incentive for people to work harder			2
" morality , on some level , is the avoidance of suffering , " he said , " or at least the decrease of suffering			2
and where , in the @entity5 , we have the financial wealth to be able to address everyone 's direct suffering , the fact that we 're not doing so is the basis for claiming that something is morally wrong			1
" extreme inequality ruins democracy it 's no secret money rules politics in @entity5			1
@entity18 spent $ 1.1 billion to win the 2012 presidential race			1
when inequality becomes extreme , it undermines democracy , as the late philosopher @entity203 and others have argued , because it creates unequal access to the political system and to positions of power			1
one person , one vote -- yeah			0
but one person with millions to spend has much more influence			0
" what is problematic in the @entity5 is the political system ... is one that is quite substantially dominated by those people that have money , " said @entity63 , the @entity66 professor			1
" they can , in the @entity5 system , yield a substantial amount of influence on the legislation through lobbying and therefore expand their advantaged position			1
" @entity226 wants us to be poor in the @entity230 tradition , there are parables and sayings that cast the rich in a negative light , implying it 's wrong to hold too much wealth , especially if you 're not using it to help less fortunate people			1
see @entity240 19:24 : " again i tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of @entity248			0
" " there 's something immoral , from the @entity253 perspective , about being very rich , " said @entity53 , the author and podcaster			2
" ( @entity53 happens to be atheist , by the way			0
) the size of the rich - poor gap matters some inequality is acceptable to pretty much everyone these days			2
no one is arguing for a fully equal society			0
but the degree of inequality really does matter when you 're trying to determine whether inequality is moral or amoral , said @entity63 , the @entity66 professor			2
when extreme inequality sets in , that 's when social and political problems follow			1
his best estimate for a fair distribution is the @entity271 , which measures how much income the top 10 % earns compared to the bottom 40 %			1
ideally , those amounts would be equal , meaning the country would have a @entity271 of one			0
according to a calculation cited by the @entity278 , the @entity5 has a 2010 @entity271 of 1.852 , which is about the same as @entity280 but not as bad as @entity281 or @entity282			1
( in an earlier version of this column , i incorrectly estimated the @entity5 @entity271 based on wealth instead of income			1
i should have let the experts handle that , and i regret the mistake )			0
by @entity63 's assessment , that means inequality here is too high			1
negative consequences for our society will result			0
inequality is bad if the poor do n't benefit , too i 'll end this list back on @entity203 , the philosopher whose 1971 book , " @entity304 , " is a must - read ( or at least a must - become - familiar - with ) for people interested in this topic			1
one of @entity203 ' theories is that inequality can be justified only when it benefits everyone in society , particularly those who are most poor and vulnerable			2
if @entity203 were creating a society from scratch , he would design it so that , in his words , " social and economic inequalities ... are to be to the greatest benefit of the least - advantaged members of society			0
" if the rich making more will help the poor be better off , too , that 's cool			0
if not , it 's unfair , or amoral			0
for real - world reference , here 's a quick look at ceo pay in the @entity5 , from the @entity327 : the average @entity329 500 ceo compensation in 2012 , according to that labor group , was $ 12.3 million			1
a worker ? $ 35,000			0
do the poor benefit from that disparity ? does everyone ? anyone ? i 'll leave you to fight about that in the comments			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity342 .			2
