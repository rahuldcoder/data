her husband was trying to deceive the police behind the @entity87 of a family tour , @entity2 ' defense lawyer @entity85 said in court			2
" @entity14 pressured [ his wife ] to come to @entity0 and use [ his family ] as cover -- that was his secret agenda , " @entity85 said in his closing statement , to justify his client 's claim she did n't know about the narcotics			1
prosecutor @entity98 asked why their trip to @entity101 was to take seven weeks , as this would mean @entity2 would have needed substantial holiday time from her nursing assistant job in @entity12			0
@entity12 law allows six to 12 days yearly paid leave for people at the beginning of their careers			0
