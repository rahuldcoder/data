if you and your significant other share political views , it could be because you like each other 's smell			1
results from a new study released monday by the @entity7 show that body odor may play an initial role in the matching of individuals with similar attitudes on political ideology			1
in the study , 125 participants rated the attractiveness of smells from strong liberals and strong conservatives , but the participants could n't see the individuals and did n't know anything about their political views			1
" people could not predict the political ideology of others by smell if you asked them , but they differentially found the smell of those who aligned with them more attractive , " said dr. @entity24 , lead author of the study			2
" so i believe smell conveys important information about long - term affinity in political ideology that becomes incorporated into a key component of subconscious attraction			0
" what does smell have to do with politics ? according to the study , smell helps individuals choose mates because the sense can signal possible social and biological behaviors , such as disease avoidance , disgust sensitivity , cheater detection and social cohesion			0
" for example , greater disgust sensitivity , which is intimately interconnected with the neural substrates of smell , predicts more conservative positions , particularly around issues involving morality and sexual reproduction , " the article notes			0
those who were doing the smelling took whiffs of small gauze pads that had been worn under the arms of 21 individuals for 24 hours .			0
