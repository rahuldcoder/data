every wine lover has a story of the first sip that drew them in			2
more often than not , it was not a glass a highly complex and expensive @entity6			0
it was likely an unsophisticated yet tantalizing bottle that rocked their world			2
my gateway drug to wine way back in the day -- @entity15 's @entity14 , a saccharine - sweet pink tipple best enjoyed ice cold			1
and for @entity21 - based wine consultant and educator @entity19 , it was that first bottle of grapey @entity23			1
" you look at the @entity26 market , and the @entity28 market -- they were originally beer and spirits markets just like @entity31			1
what shifted @entity26 ? @entity33			0
what shifted @entity28 ? @entity23 , " she tells me			0
" very grapey and simple , people can understand them and like them			0
in @entity31 , we have n't done that			1
" in the @entity43 , many wine enthusiasts look back fondly to that first fruit - bomb in a glass as our introduction to the world of wine			1
but in @entity31 -- the world 's biggest market for red wine -- consumers have gone from zero to premium @entity53 in less than two decades			1
tasked with making the nation 's first fine wines , @entity31 's pioneering winemakers have gone for the grandeur and not the " gateway			1
" " the state - owned companies created the wine industry in @entity31			1
not a pink wine , " says @entity63 , a @entity65 - based wine distributor and founder of @entity67			2
" many wine companies , especially those state - owned companies , are run by people not in the wine business or have little knowledge of winemaking and grape growing , " adds @entity63			2
" what they are after is to create something they can be proud and to leave some kind of a legacy			0
" watch : inside @entity31 's wine country gifting @entity63 says @entity31 's " legacy " wines were usually dark red with heavy oak and equally heavy packaging			1
at a cost of $ 80 to $ 245 a bottle , they were sold through state - owned channels for internal use by local governments			0
gifting the bottles is a tradition that extends to today , even in the era of austerity amidst @entity21 's crackdown on corruption			0
" there 's the market that buys the wine and wo n't be consuming the wine , and the other market which is people who buy the wine and are actual consumers			1
both markets are in @entity31 , " says @entity108 , ceo of @entity31 's @entity109			1
@entity109 produces some 2 million bottles a year , with retail prices going up to around $ 90 each			0
its chairman 's @entity113 scored impressive ratings from wine guru @entity116			2
" we planted in 1998 , and now after 17 years of experiments , i think we can make a very decent wine , " @entity118 tells me			0
' @entity124 wine ' private winemakers like @entity126 are experimenting not to replicate a @entity53 , but to craft its own signature style			1
at her vineyard in @entity131 province , i tasted one of @entity118 's experiments -- a flight of pre-filtered sparkling wines all crafted in @entity31			1
one particular year nabbed the attention of visiting wine industry folk who hailed it the " party wine " of the tasting			0
the effervescent and friendly bubbly may very well find its way into the flutes of @entity31 's increasingly curious and open - minded wine consumers			1
" i 'm very lucky because i educate and work with people who are getting engaged in wine , " says the @entity21 - based @entity19			2
" many moons ago ... they talked about @entity6 and some talked about @entity150			0
now i have students arrive in class and say , ' well i 've heard about @entity153 and i love drinking it ! ' " entry - level wines after fast - forwarding from zero to @entity53 in less than two decades , @entity31 's wine market is finally doing what it should have done at the beginning			1
it 's easing back into user - friendly , entry - level wines			2
wine distributor @entity63 is starting to see even " big wine " buyers going for more reasonable wines as more @entity166 consumers take to wine , and actually drink what they buy			0
and @entity19 hopes they will go for the cheap stuff			0
" there 's a reason why @entity174 is the most popular restaurant in the world , " she says emphatically			2
" i just want to see more people drinking more wine			0
i do n't care what wine they drink			0
just as long as they 're happy			0
