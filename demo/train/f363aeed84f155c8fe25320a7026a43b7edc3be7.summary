@entity0 -- at the pep rally where @entity4 debuted its third - generation tablet computer , one question was on everyone 's lips : so , what do we call this thing ? the answer , according to an @entity4 spokesman : " it 's just ' @entity14			1
' it 's what it is			0
" or it is what it is n't			0
it 's not the @entity14 3 , and it 's not the @entity14 hd			1
both names were widely rumored before @entity4 's coming - out party for the device on wednesday in @entity0			1
it 's not @entity14 , which is what people on @entity27 started calling it during a nearly 90 - minute press conference about the device			1
the longer @entity4 execs talked about the tablet computer 's new features -- better screen , faster connection -- without actually giving it a name , the more anxious the @entity31 of the @entity32 became			1
" come on @entity4 , name it already , " one person wrote			1
" is it an @entity41 ? " asked another			0
tech writer @entity45 : " screw it , i 'm just going to call it ' lover			2
' " at a demo of the device after the press conference , the topic was widely discussed among technology journalists , who were trying to confirm what to call the thing			2
" it 's the new @entity14			1
what are you talking about ? " another @entity4 spokeswoman said , as if it 's common for updated devices to come out with the same names as their predecessors			1
perhaps this naming convention -- sticking with a singular product name without numbers or the names of cats to follow it -- is n't entirely new for @entity4			2
one journalist pointed out that the @entity69 follows the same tack			0
but there still seems to be potential for confusion , especially since the first - generation @entity14 was just called " @entity14 " and the next one was called " @entity74			1
" if someone were selling one of these new @entity79 on @entity80 next year , what would they call it ? " so this is the ' new ipad , ' " said @entity82 , a tech writer for the @entity83			2
" is the next one going to be called the ' @entity85 ' ? where do they go from there ? " maybe " @entity89			0
" that would seem logical if unlikely at this point			0
on the other hand , @entity4 has been through this sort of thing before			2
when the first @entity14 came out , people online were comparing it to a high - tech tampon			1
" i do n't think it will be a big deal , " @entity97 , a writer for the @entity99 blog , said of the whole @entity14 name debate			0
" if you recall , people did n't like the name @entity14 when it first came out			0
they seem to have sold a few of them			0
" a few million , that is			0
the company says it has sold 55 million @entity79 since the device debuted two years ago			0
when it comes to tablets , @entity4 's competitors are scrambling to catch up			1
it probably would take more than a name snafu to change that .			0

@entity4 's new @entity14 is just called ' @entity14 '
the previous @entity14 was called @entity14 2 , leading to speculation about an ' @entity14 '
@entity27 users mock the lack of a name during @entity4 's *announcement*
tech journalists *struggle* to figure out what to call it
