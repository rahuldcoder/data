none of the four plans to run in the next election , expected to be held in may			2
" the @entity4 expects the highest standards of its representatives and believes that they have a duty to be transparent and accountable servants to their constituents at all times , " the party said in a statement			1
what the @entity5 media has now dubbed the " cash - for - lobbying " scandal comes just weeks before the expected general election in which @entity4 , the ruling party , faces a stiff challenge from the opposition conservatives			1
cabinet secretary @entity34 , a non-partisan official , called the allegations " extremely serious			0
" the undercover filming was done by reporters for @entity39 's " dispatches " program , which aired monday night			0
they set up a fictional @entity43 company that claimed to want to hire @entity5 politicians for an advisory board , and an undercover reporter then invited the @entity47 to a rented office in @entity0 to discuss the work			1
a hidden camera captured the politicians agreeing to use their experience and influence to lobby the government in exchange for thousands of pounds ( dollars ) in pay			1
" i 'd be very interested			0
i 'm a bit like a sort of cab for hire , i suppose , at the moment , " said @entity14 , who was the transport and business secretary under former prime minister @entity59			1
@entity14 said he usually charges a daily rate of between £ 3,000 and £ 5,000 ( $ 4,500 and $ 7,500 ) for similar work			2
among the services @entity14 offered was to try to get @entity59 to show up at a client 's event			1
" the three to five just depends a bit on the work , the clients , to be honest , " @entity14 said on the tape			2
" i mean , sometimes i can charge more			0
" @entity12 , who was @entity5 defense secretary during the invasion of @entity75 in 2003 , said he would request a similar amount			1
he said he could lead delegations to see certain ministers , or he could write letters to ministers to persuade them to see a client			0
" one of the challenges , i think , which i 'm really looking forward to is sort of translating my knowledge and contacts about ( the ) international scene into something that , bluntly , makes money , " @entity12 said			2
lawmaker @entity15 , who was implicated in the parliamentary expenses scandal last may , was also shown on hidden camera to be interested in a possible job			1
@entity93 spent £ 22,500 ( $ 33,700 ) of taxpayers ' money for repairs on a seaside home far from her constituency , days after declaring it as her second home , records last year showed			0
@entity93 told the undercover reporter that she would be willing to approach parliamentary committees or special advisers on behalf of the company			0
@entity13 , who served as health secretary and trade and industry secretary in the cabinet , said she is looking for another " major board position " to employ her for three days a month			2
asked how easy it would be for her to arrange meetings with cabinet ministers or senior civil servants , @entity13 replied , " it 's very doable , but you have to be kind of quite careful , you know , about how you do it			1
and it partly depends on the individual minister			0
" the conservatives called on prime minister @entity123 to launch an investigation into the scandal			0
@entity126 , a columnist for @entity127 , described the revelations as " dirty money and dirtier politics			0
" " our democracy could hardly bear another major political scandal , but here we have one : as grubby , underhand and dispiriting as last year 's expenses revelations , " @entity126 wrote			2
" the question now is whether it 's as widespread			0
" @entity138 columnist @entity137 called it " the week that could finish @entity4 " and said it put the @entity122 , also called the @entity141 , in a good position ahead of the election			1
" any hope that the shadow of greed had lifted was crushed by accusations that former ministers sought money for favors , " she wrote			0
" the taped claim by @entity153 that ' i 'm like a sort of cab for hire ' is a remark geared to give the @entity141 a chauffeured drive to power			0
