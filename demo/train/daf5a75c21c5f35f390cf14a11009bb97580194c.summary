-- you insisted the first @entity3 wild - driving viral video was a fake			1
what do you think of the second one , @entity6 ? oh , this one is " unequivocally , one hundred percent , totally , absolutely real , " he says			1
how would he know ? because he 's in it , the victim of a prank and @entity3 's revenge			1
a year ago , @entity6 called out @entity3 on the @entity11 auto blog after the millions of views for a video in which @entity3 dons a disguise and takes a supposedly unsuspecting car salesman for a high - speed test drive			1
it 's one of those commercials masking itself as a video that begs the question : is it fake ? @entity6 led the " it 's obviously staged " camp			1
so @entity24 and @entity3 decided to exact revenge			1
they tempted him into coming to @entity27 by promising an exclusive test drive in a highly anticipated new corvette			0
then they dressed @entity3 up in a new disguise with a neck tattoo , sideburns , mullet covered by a camouflage hat and sent him over in a fake cab ( with real markings ) to pick @entity6 up at the hotel			1
@entity3 's cover story was that he 's just out of prison after 10 years , so when a highway patrol officer pulls them over , the " cab driver " decides he can not go back to the joint			1
and , despite the protests of @entity6 , the chase is on			2
as the car tears through an industrial complex , @entity6 screams in the back seat and begs the driver to stop			1
" i 'm gon na lose this guy , " @entity3 says as he winds and slides over asphalt			2
this never works ! " @entity6 replies			2
finally the car skids into the open door of a warehouse where the folks from @entity24 await			0
as of thursday evening , the video , " @entity61 2 , " had 1,000,000 views in just a few hours			0
@entity61 , meanwhile , now has almost 41 million views			0
@entity64 wrote on a blog post on how he fell for the cab gag			0
" i thought i was going to die , " he wrote			2
" i yelled , i banged the glass , i actually tried to kick through the @entity69 window between the driver and me			0
i pulled out my phone to call 911 but could n't keep it steady enough to dial			0
" he insists this video was definitely real			2
but is it ? is the video that proves the fake video is n't a fake actually a fake , too ? the conspiracy theories have already begun			1
keep your eye on the car , the naysayers say			0
something changes on the car			0
and it looks like someone has driven the course before			0
multiple takes , they wonder ? that 's aside from the questions about how did he get fooled , not figure out the cab was fake , not see the cameras , not realize it was @entity3			1
" looking back on it now , i 'm not sure how i did n't guess beforehand , but it boils down to the fact that i had no reason to believe anything was off , " he said			0
or was it ? what do you think ?			0

auto blogger @entity6 *mad*e @entity3 *mad* when he said a *popular* video was fake
@entity3 decided to take the blogger on a wild ride of his own
@entity6 *swears* his *panicked* screams are real , that he thought he might die
a few conspiracists do n't *buy* it ; they think there are clues that this one is fake , too
