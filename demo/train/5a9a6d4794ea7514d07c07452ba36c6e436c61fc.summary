-- around the country on friday , you 'll likely see the iconic black and white @entity4 flag flying over federal buildings			1
at military bases , there will be ceremonies with troops in dress uniforms marching and leaders speaking			1
at the @entity13 , secretary of defense @entity12 will oversee a ceremony that will conclude with a flyover by warplanes and helicopters in honor of the 83,000 known service members still listed as prisoners of war or missing in action			1
but not every remembrance of those @entity24 will include such pomp and activity			1
if you were to walk through the mess hall of a @entity29 ship or an army installation , you might see a small table covered in a simple cloth			1
one chair sits in front of a single formal place setting			0
on the plate , salt and a slice of lemon			0
next to the plate , a glass vase containing a red rose with a red ribbon around the base			0
this silent tribute is full of symbolism			0
the table is round " to show our everlasting concern " according to the @entity49 of @entity51 website			1
the cloth is white , " symbolizing the purity of their motives when answering the call to duty			0
" the rose reminds " us of the lives of these men ... and their loved ones and friends who keep the faith , while seeking answers			0
" the red ribbon " symbolizes our continued determination to account for them			0
" the slice of lemon " reminds us of the bitter fate of those captured and missing in a foreign land			1
" the salt " symbolizes the tears of our missing and their families who long for answers after decades of uncertainty			2
" a bible represents the " strength gained through faith in our country , founded as one nation under @entity85 , to sustain those lost from our midst			0
" a glass is inverted on the table " to symbolize their inability to share this evening 's toast			2
" finally , there is the empty chair , with that obvious symbolism			2
at larger events where @entity99 / @entity4 groups gather , a similar table will be set , but with identical place settings , one for each of the armed forces , including the @entity103 , and a sixth for civilians still missing			1
@entity106 , secretary of the @entity107 , said when an explanation is read of what each item symbolizes , she " can barely get through it to the end			0
" @entity114 's father , col. @entity113 , disappeared after bailing out from his burning plane during a mission over @entity117 in 1966			0
she said the pow / @entity4 table is an important , if not well known , part of her organization 's efforts to remember the missing			1
friday night , as you sit down for dinner , look at the salt or perhaps the chair with a loved one next to you and remember there are those still waiting for a loved one to come home .			2

some 83,000 @entity24 are listed as prisoners of war or missing in action
they will be honored in ceremonies throughout the @entity24 on friday
empty table set in mess halls is a less *public* *tradition*
