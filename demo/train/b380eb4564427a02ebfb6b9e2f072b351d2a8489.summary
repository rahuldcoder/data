@entity0 , which built the @entity2 rocket that exploded in a massive fireball tuesday , described the explosion as a " catastrophic failure			1
" it certainly looked like it			0
will this failure also be a setback for the burgeoning private space industry ? the unmanned rocket was carrying a @entity12 cargo spacecraft loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of equipment for the @entity14 , a floating laboratory that travels at 17,240 miles per hour			1
it blew up at @entity18 's @entity17 in @entity19 seconds after launch			0
since @entity18 's space shuttle program was canceled in 2011 , the private sector has ferried cargo to the station			1
@entity0 is one of two private companies hired by @entity18 to run such missions , and the other is @entity30 's @entity29			1
the botched mission was to be @entity0 ' third of eight as part of a $ 1.9 billion contract with @entity18			2
@entity29 is set to send its fifth mission to the station in december			0
what happened ? while the private sector is not new to such accidents , like the @entity29 test mission that exploded in august , the @entity2 blast marks the first such @entity18 - contracted accident since the agency turned to the private sector to ferry space station cargo			1
@entity18 - contracted space travel is highly coveted because of the value of the associated contracts , which are in the billions of dollars , leading to a new incarnation of the space race and what many refer to as the privatization of space			0
teams investigate failure of unmanned rocket off @entity19 the failed launch is an inferno for @entity0 , and perhaps the public 's perception of the private sector 's ability to manage these complicated missions will be affected , but it is nothing more than a blip for the aerospace industry			1
as @entity30 said in a tweet after the august @entity29 explosion : " rockets are tricky ... " furthermore , @entity18 recently awarded contracts for manned missions to the station worth $ 6.8 billion to both @entity29 and @entity75 , contracts that are not in jeopardy as a result of this explosion			2
and about that public perception of the private sector : @entity18 has always relied on the private industry to help accomplish its space exploration goals			1
companies like @entity75 and @entity84 have been contracted to design and build every vehicle that has carried astronauts since the start of the space program			0
in fact , @entity75 was the main contractor for building the @entity14			0
opinion : do n't overreact to rocket explosion so @entity18 has always relied on private industry , a need that is only increasing as the agency 's budget becomes stretched even further and it turns to private enterprise to take on one of the program 's crown jewels : manned space flights			1
and some say the lack of bureaucracy in the private sector will bring financial savings , speed of innovation and efficiency			2
while the broader industry will remain largely unaffected by tuesday 's accident , no one wins when a rocket explodes			2
tweets of condolences to @entity0 from industry insiders flooded social media after the incident			2
they may be competitors , but they all understand just how complicated these missions are			0
no one wants to go down in flames			0
opinion : @entity124 blow up ; we move on			0

@entity0 built the unmanned @entity2 rocket that exploded in a fireball tuesday
@entity18 has hired it and @entity29 to shuttle cargo to the @entity14
this is the first such accident since @entity18 turned to the private sector for the cargo missions
but @entity18 has always relied on private industry , and the blast is n't likely to *change* that
