@entity0 -- the court documents continued to fly in the ongoing legal battle between @entity5 third baseman @entity4 and @entity6			2
as @entity4 ' appeal of his 211 - game suspension went on hiatus this week so the arbitrator could tend to other matters , the @entity6 responded to his lawsuit against it and commissioner @entity14 with a motion to move it from state court to federal court in hopes it will be dismissed			1
in its 426 - page filing , the @entity6 argues that @entity4 should abide by baseball 's collective bargaining agreement and pursue his appeal solely through the arbitration process			1
@entity4 : ' i 'm fighting for my life ' in response to the motion , @entity4 ' attorney @entity27 told @entity1 , " as is its practice , @entity6 has chosen to share its filing with the press well before sending it to mr. @entity4 's legal team			1
nonetheless , mr. @entity4 's claims against @entity6 and commissioner @entity14 arise from their tortious conduct , separate and apart from the issues being decided in the arbitration process			1
it is ironic that @entity6 -- having filed suit in state court in @entity42 for tortious interference in order to obtain evidence to use in the arbitration proceeding -- now complains that mr. @entity4 's tortious interference claim must be heard as part of the arbitration			2
@entity6 knows that these state law claims properly belong where they were filed , in the @entity52			0
" attorney : @entity4 had ' consulting relationship ' with @entity55 last friday @entity4 filed suit against @entity14 and the @entity6 alleging that they " engaged in tortious and egregious conduct with one and only one goal ... to destroy the reputation and career of @entity4			0
" the lawsuit claims that in its investigation of @entity55 and his @entity55 anti-aging clinic in @entity65 , @entity6 engaged in vigilante justice to prove that @entity4 was using performance enhancing drugs			0
@entity4 fights suspension " they have ignored the procedures set forth in baseball 's collectively bargained labor agreements ; violated the strict confidentiality imposed by these agreements ; paid individuals millions of dollars and made promises of future employment to individuals in order to get them to produce documents and to testify on @entity6 ' s behalf ; bullied and intimidated those individuals who refused to cooperate with their witch hunt ; and singled out ( @entity4 ) for an unprecedented 211 - game suspension -- the longest non-permanent ban in baseball history , " the suit says			1
@entity4 , 38 , says he is fighting for his life in an effort to overturn the suspension			2
he has hired a high - priced team of lawyers , publicists and investigators			0
he has shown up each day during this week 's arbitration process at the @entity6 's @entity98 headquarters			1
his lawsuit outside the arbitration process is an effort to save his reputation and his $ 25 million salary for the 2014 season			0
