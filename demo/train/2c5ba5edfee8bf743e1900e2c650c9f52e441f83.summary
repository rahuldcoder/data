-- tire talk may be dominating the 2013 @entity3 championship but @entity5 manufacturer @entity4 insists they are not to blame for the dangerous blow - outs that compromised driver safety at the @entity9 @entity8			1
@entity4 attracted more media attention after the race at @entity12 , @entity13 than @entity14 , who won the race for @entity16			1
but despite facing intense scrutiny the @entity5 company say it was how the teams chose to use the tires that led to the rubber unraveling on six cars , including @entity16 driver @entity23 -- who led the race early on -- and both @entity26			1
" a series of different causes led to the tire failures at @entity12 , " said @entity4 in a statement			1
" rear tires mounted the wrong way round ... in other words , the right - hand tire being placed where the left - hand one should be and vice versa on the cars that suffered failures			1
" low tire pressures , extreme cambers [ the angle at which the tire slants away from the car ] and high kerbs ... such as that on @entity47 at @entity12 which was the scene of most of the failures			1
" the 2013 tires do not compromise safety if used in the correct way			2
" the drivers and teams had called for urgent action after the dramatic scenes at @entity12 and the sport 's governing body responded immediately by amending its rules which prevent race drivers testing and tires being changed during the season			2
the @entity62 have decided to turn a three - day test for young drivers at @entity12 later this month into a tire development test involving the @entity3 teams and first - choice drivers			2
@entity4 has also reacted by introducing new rear tires for this weekend 's @entity69 @entity8 at the nurburgring			1
no arguments , no attacks these new tires are strengthened with @entity74 -- a high - strength , synthetic material -- instead of the steel used in the 2013 tires			2
the teams trialled this new rubber in @entity80 but failed to unanimously agree to then introduce it for the races in @entity83 and @entity12			0
@entity4 hope to provide a long - term solution by introducing a new range of tires from the @entity87 @entity8 at the end of july onwards			1
the teams will test trial tires , which will go back to 2012 's construction , at the test in @entity9 between july 17 - 19			1
" what happened at @entity12 was completely unexpected , " said @entity4 's motorsport director @entity93			2
" these incidents , which have upset us greatly , have stressed the urgency of the changes that we already suggested			0
" i would like to underline the collaboration and support that we are receiving from the teams , drivers , @entity62 and @entity103 [ the sport 's commercial rights holder and broadcaster ]			0
" in no way are we intending to create arguments or attack anybody			0
we have taken our responsibilities upon ourselves			0
" @entity16 motorsport director @entity111 has welcomed @entity4 's explanation and planned changes			1
" @entity4 apologised and made a clear statement that it was n't about complaining or saying that somebody else was to be blamed , " he told reporters			2
" i guess @entity4 are going to be clearer in advising the teams in terms of camber , on tire pressures and on swapping the rear tyres			1
most of the teams swap tyres and have been doing it for many races			0
" safety is a priority and it 's a moment where @entity3 must show unity and concentrate on solving the issues			0
" tires still a concern @entity135 driver @entity134 said on the team website : " after what we saw in @entity12 , we now go to the @entity139 , confident we can see an improvement			2
" i know that various modifications have been applied and let 's hope that means all of us drivers can race in safe conditions			0
" at the moment , we ca n't make any predictions , because no one has tried them and we do n't know what and how many benefits they can bring , apart from trusting in the fact that it wo n't be dangerous to race			0
" but @entity23 , who lost the race lead in @entity9 after his left - rear tire dramatically exploded on the eighth lap of the race , warned : " i think it 's still a concern and something where we need to see how it goes			1
" the fall - out from the @entity9 race means there will be regulated in - season tire testing as well as plans to introduce further testing next january			1
in june , @entity4 and @entity16 were reprimanded at an @entity62 hearing for organizing a three - day tire test in may			1
the @entity69 team 's " secret " test still riles their rivals -- especially as they have since won races in @entity173 and @entity9 -- but the shocking tire explosions at @entity12 underlined the need for @entity4 to find a legitimate solution to the tire failures			1
@entity4 had wanted to introduce a new tire construction at the @entity80 @entity8 in june but failed to get all the teams to agree to the plan at a meeting in @entity173			1
a spate of worryingly delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- earlier in the season had led to concerns the tires were not safe			2
when @entity4 took over from @entity189 as @entity3 's official tire supplier in 2011 , the rubber was deliberately designed to be less durable so that teams would take more pit stops and the racing would be more unpredictable			2
but subsequent changes to the construction of the 2013 tire , based on the same principles , have now provoked not just unpredictability but chaos on the track			0
the @entity5 company now hopes the introduction of new tires and an agreement to monitor and test the tires throughout the season , with the cooperation of the teams and the sport 's governing body , will put an end to the problems			0
new deal the @entity5 company are close to agreeing a new deal to continue as @entity3 's tire supplier when its current contract runs out at the end of the season			0
pirelli say they now just need to secure agreement from some of the teams			0
being @entity3 's tire supplier is an expensive business with @entity4 effectively paying to supply tires to the @entity3 grid in a negotiated deal which also includes track - side advertising			1
the teams pay a small contribution towards the rubber but the bulk of the bill for the season 's 36,000 spheres of rubber is picked up by the tire supplier			0
" it 's not cheap , " said @entity93			0
" i 'm sure there are quite a few teams who do n't have our overall budget to be in @entity3			0
" the smallest teams on the grid still spend $ 52m a year running their f1 teams			0
" it 's a lot of money is n't it ? " @entity93 said ruefully .			0
