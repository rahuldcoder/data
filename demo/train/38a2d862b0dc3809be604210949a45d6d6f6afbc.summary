-- @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 has gone from scapegoat to national hero in the space of two @entity6 and is hoping that the wave of emotion which both he and his teammates rode to secure a penalty shootout triumph against @entity12 will see them past the stern test provided by @entity15 in the quarterfinals friday			1
@entity1 , who was held responsible for a blunder in the @entity18 in @entity19 as his side went out to the @entity21 in the quarterfinals , made two superb saves in the shootout as @entity2 won its last 16 clash in a nail biting finale in @entity27			1
several players , captain @entity29 and star player @entity30 included , showed outward signs of emotion during the course of the match against @entity12 but @entity1 told @entity0 that it was a natural reaction given the pressure of hosting the competition			1
" we were in a situation where we could have been eliminated from the round of 16 in a @entity40 in @entity2 , so not only did i get emotional , but so did some of the other members of the team , " he said			2
" we know the importance of winning this @entity40 in @entity2 , not only for ourselves , but for our families , and especially for the fans			2
" we do n't know when @entity2 will have another opportunity to host a @entity40 , so i think we need to take advantage of this opportunity , " added the 34 - year - old			2
despite his 84 caps , @entity1 has had his critics and in the buildup to the @entity40 finals spent an unhappy spell at @entity57 second - flight team @entity56 , before being farmed out on loan to @entity61 side @entity59			2
his place in the @entity2 team appeared at risk , but @entity1 credits coach @entity65 with sticking with him despite his difficulties			1
" i think it 's the primary reason why i 'm here today			0
eight months ago he gave an interview saying that regardless if i was playing or not , i would playing at the @entity40			0
so this is something that gives you peace of mind , " he added			0
whether that peace of mind extends to the clash with @entity15 and the prospect of preventing their goalscoring sensation @entity80 from adding to his competition leading tally of five goals is another matter			1
@entity85 scored twice -- his first probably the goal of the tournament -- in his side 's 2 - 0 last 16 win over @entity90 and @entity1 admits he will be difficult to stop			1
" @entity80 is a player that has been amazing everyone			0
i think that the @entity40 gives players the opportunity to showcase their work to the world and i think @entity80 is making the most of it , " he said			0
" for now , though , i hope that against @entity2 , he can halt his continued progression as a player until after the tournament has ended , because @entity2 has to win			1
" @entity2 has its own trump card in @entity103 's @entity30 , who has impressed @entity1 with his mature performances despite carrying the hopes of a nation			1
" you see a 22 - year - old in his first @entity40 in @entity2 taking to the pitch as if he were playing with his friends in the street			0
in my opinion , that 's his biggest strength , " said @entity1			2
" he 's just like any other guy and i think his family is the main reason why he has accomplished so much , and yet remained humble			0
i think he 's a fantastic kid			0
" the last eight clash in @entity120 could well hinge on which of the young superstars can put their imprint on the proceedings , while @entity1 will be hoping to avoid the sort of error that haunted him during his last appearance at this stage of the competition four years ago .			0
