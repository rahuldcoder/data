@entity0 -- the @entity2 is about to reverse a century of resistance to technology , requiring that federal agents record interviews of most suspects under arrest			2
it 's a policy change that the department , at the behest of agents , has resisted for decades			0
a memorandum from deputy attorney general @entity14 , first reported wednesday by the @entity15 , says that beginning july 11 , " there is a presumption that the custodial statement of an individual in a place of detention with suitable recording equipment , following arrest but prior to initial appearance , will be electronically recorded			1
" the policy will apply to the @entity26 ; the @entity28 ; the @entity29 ; and @entity27			1
@entity14 's memo was issued without any public notice on may 12			2
@entity33 law enforcement officials confirmed the authenticity of the memo			0
the @entity2 declined to comment			0
those include national security or intelligence interviews or those done under the public safety exception to the requirement that suspects be read their @entity45 rights			1
and it also does n't apply to interviews of suspects before arrest			2
recorded interviews are common practice among state and local police departments nationwide			0
even inside the @entity2 , the inspector general 's office records interviews			0
but until the @entity14 memo , @entity2 policy discouraged recorded interviews for decades , in part because of fears that it could aid defendants on trial			1
that meant that even in high - profile trials , juries are often treated to the spectacle of @entity26 or other agents having to testify about what their hand - scribbled notes taken during interviews were supposed to mean			1
