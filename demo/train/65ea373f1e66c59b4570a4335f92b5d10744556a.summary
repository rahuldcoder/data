-- a week ago , on feel - good @entity5 , tv viewers in the @entity3 state of @entity4 were subjected to a racist campaign ad sponsored by former representative and now - @entity9 candidate @entity8			1
the ad , which suggests that his opponent , @entity3 senator @entity11 , spends too much government money , shows an @entity15 woman riding a bicycle in a landscape of rice paddies			1
" your economy get very weak			0
we take your jobs , " says the native @entity23 actress in a mock @entity25 accent while addressing " @entity26			1
" @entity8 also appears , saying at the end , " i approve this message			0
" public condemnation ensued , with demands for an apology and the ad 's removal			2
it 's not the first time that @entity25 , or any connections to @entity25 , have been used to stoke fear this @entity3 election season			1
in early january , a group in support of @entity44 presidential hopeful @entity43 released a campaign ad slamming then - candidate @entity46 , the former ambassador to @entity25			1
the " @entity48 " ad showed @entity46 speaking @entity25 and wearing a red tikka on his forehead ( a sacred mark associated with @entity52 ) and questioned his adoption of girls from @entity25 and @entity55			1
" @entity46 : american values ? " the ad asks , calling him " the @entity57 candidate , " " weak on @entity25 ? " with ostensibly @entity25 music in the background			1
@entity43 denounced the ad , telling @entity0 he had no control over his supporters ' actions			0
then on thursday , a @entity65 sergeant was found not guilty of hazing @entity67 @entity66 , who committed suicide last april in @entity69			2
a @entity65 report revealed that @entity66 had been beaten by his superiors with sand poured in his mouth for falling asleep while on duty			0
another @entity65 was sentenced to 30 days in jail and demoted ; a third faces court - martial over the death			2
@entity66 's case along with that of pvt. @entity82 , who was found dead in october from an apparent suicide , have spurred @entity15 members of @entity85 to demand hearings on hazing in the military			1
@entity82 , the only @entity25 @entity89 soldier in his unit in @entity69 , was called " gook , " " chink " and " dragon lady , " forced to crawl on gravel while fellow troops threw rocks at him , and made to shout instructions in @entity25 to fellow troops ( no one else in his unit spoke @entity25 )			1
the @entity15 civil rights group @entity101 has met with @entity103 officials to demand better treatment of @entity105 in the military			1
against all of this , @entity107 , a @entity108 grad and the @entity110 's first @entity3 - born player of @entity25 or @entity112 descent , has vaulted himself to stardom			1
on saturday , @entity107 led the @entity114 to their fifth straight victory			2
his 109 points in his first four starts this past week have surpassed @entity118 's to become the most by any player since the @entity110 - @entity121 merger in 1976			1
read about @entity122 vs. @entity123 for those who 've been following the campaign ad controversies as well as the @entity66 and @entity82 cases , @entity107 's meteoric rise has been a much - needed sign of hope			1
but the conversations on @entity131 , in bars and living rooms are as diverse as the @entity15 community itself			2
some are pumped up about seeing an @entity15 face next to @entity137 's or moved by @entity107 's public devotion to @entity139			1
others are analyzing @entity107 's academic and athletic prowess and thinking about the role model he 'll be for their children			1
@entity107 : the @entity110 's breath of fresh air @entity107 himself has been candid about the racism he 's encountered along the way			1
" it 's a sport for white and black people , " he told the @entity149 in 2008			2
" you do n't get respect for being an @entity15 basketball player in the @entity3 ... i hear everything			1
' go back to @entity25			2
orchestra is on the other side of campus			0
' " read how @entity107 has a shot at basketball immortality unfortunately , success does n't stamp out racism			2
minutes after @entity107 's breathtaking career - high 38 - point performance against the @entity166 friday night , @entity167 national columnist @entity168 tweeted " some lucky lady in @entity170 is gon na feel a couple inches of pain tonight			1
" after condemnation by the @entity174 , he tweeted an apology , acknowledging that he had " debased a feel - good sports moment			2
for that , i 'm truly sorry			0
" almost exactly a decade ago , some of us remember similar knocks against a certain 7 ' 6 " new kid on the block			0
@entity183 ran a column by @entity185 in 2002 saying , " the [ @entity187 ] franchise could wind up with egg foo yong all over its face " and " what happens the first time a bona fide @entity110 strongman , say @entity196 , whacks [ @entity194 ] in the chopsticks ? " just this past week , a @entity198 fan , @entity197 , was banned from matches for three years and fined 200 pounds ( us $ 315 ) for cursing and making monkey sounds at @entity202 's @entity201 , who is from @entity203			1
to be fair , @entity107 and other minority athletes today have not been subjected to the level of racism that @entity89 sports pioneers faced before them			2
@entity209 was a great @entity89 athlete who prevailed despite being born into an officially and unofficially racist society			0
the @entity89 track star , who had to live in off - campus segregated housing at @entity214 , went on to win four gold medals at the @entity216 in @entity217 , much to the dismay of @entity219			0
three - quarters of a century later , there are those who want to leave race out of the equation altogether and embrace minority athletes , actors and other pioneers for their skills alone rather than their skin color			0
" many people want the debate to end , " says @entity230 , the director and producer of " @entity209 , " a forthcoming @entity233 documentary			0
" but the debate is n't settled			0
it wo n't end until there 's more opportunity			0
" many of us have been lucky enough to escape the burn of bullying and racism			0
we might have walked through our schoolyards without hearing taunts from fellow students			0
we might have gotten the promotions we deserved at work			0
our perfect @entity250 may have averted giggles and impatience			0
we may have served in the armed forces without being treated any differently from fellow troops			0
and we might have been lucky enough to escape the perpetrators of hate crimes , like the laid - off @entity258 autoworkers who in 1982 beat @entity259 , a @entity260 , to death with a baseball bat after his bachelor party because they were bitter about competition from @entity266 carmakers			0
such xenophobic sentiment gets eerily stirred up by ads like the ones attacking sen. @entity11 and @entity46			0
hopefully one day , @entity3 of @entity15 descent will no longer be seen as foreigners , economic competition or anything less than equal @entity3			1
until then , race matters , whether we like it or not			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity277 .			2
