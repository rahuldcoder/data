-- even the most sophisticated traveler could be forgiven for thinking that there 's little more to @entity3 than its iconic canal , seaside capital , and snorkeler - packed @entity8 islands			1
the @entity10 region of @entity3 has spectacular rolling farmlands and blissfully empty beaches			1
but there 's a more secret and equally spectacular side to the country about a five - hour drive west from @entity17 : the @entity18 of @entity10			1
here , rolling farmlands and stands of mahogany and cocobolo trees hug an azure coastline , luring surfers , nature buffs , and , increasingly , travelers and second - home owners from all over			2
although roadside real - estate billboards suggest a far more developed future , @entity10 has managed to stay blessedly free of resorts			1
in their place are a handful of low - key -- and far more affordable -- boutique hotels			2
the most stylish is the seven - room @entity36 , just outside the fishing village of @entity38			1
the red - tiled hideaway , located on an 800 - acre parcel of the @entity41 , started out as a private escape for @entity44 interior designer @entity43 and his wife , @entity45			0
" the area reminded us of @entity52 , " says @entity43 , who landscaped the estate with fragrant jasmine , plumeria , and hibiscus			0
in 2005 , the couple opened their place as a hotel , and last fall they added 20 new seaside duplex lofts			0
as stylish as they are family - friendly , the setups come with full - size kitchens , extra guest beds , and mosaic - tile flooring			0
an in - house stable is ready for shoreline horseback rides , and you can sign up for snorkeling trips to nearby @entity67 , a palm - fringed refuge where thousands of leatherback turtles converge to build nests			2
farther inland , the center of @entity38 has a cow - town vibe : picture low - slung cottages painted bright green and yellow , and ranchers wearing handmade @entity3 hats			1
@entity78 is also the color of choice at the new @entity81			0
this five - room @entity82 comes with locally crafted cocobolo furniture and a wraparound veranda overlooking @entity38 's main street			1
perhaps best of all , it 's within walking distance of local hangout @entity88 , a pro shop that does double duty as a café and juice bar , and @entity94 , a no - frills , alfresco cantina run by retired @entity98 officer @entity97 , which serves the best barbecue ribs in @entity10			1
of course , beyond the culinary surf and turf , the region 's big draw is its blissfully empty beaches : some of @entity3 's most scenic -- @entity107 , @entity108 , and the black - sand @entity109 with its eight - foot breaks -- are short drives from @entity38			1
closer to home , @entity38 's @entity113 is a good launchpad for day trips to @entity117			1
( fishermen stationed by the pier rent their motorboats , captain included , for about $ 50 round trip			0
) the hotel - free and nearly visitor - free isle is named for its resident black and green iguanas			0
sign up for an @entity127 snorkeling and hiking tour ; you might just get a good look at some hatchlings			2
while it may be hard to top that sight , 77 - year - old @entity132 knows how to command equal wows			0
her lemon - yellow bakery in a bungalow , @entity138 , is famous across @entity3 for its home - style sweets , like almond queques ( pound cakes ) and creamy chicheme , a shake blended from sweetened milk , fresh corn , and crushed vanilla beans			0
she also stashes a cake or two in the kitchen for favorite customers , such as former @entity3 president and @entity38 native @entity151			1
swoon loudly enough and @entity153 may just reward you with a thick presidential slice			0
