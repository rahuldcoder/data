-- for years , bloggers and other netizens have repeated : " a link is not an endorsement			0
" now it appears that we have to add , " a ' like , ' follow ' or ' retweet ' is not an endorsement , either			0
" that 's the only way to respond to the wave of breathless news stories and fancy web tools claiming to divine all kinds of correlations between @entity16 buzz or @entity18 followers and how the @entity20 presidential candidates will fare in the primaries			1
the worst of the new wave is the @entity26 's new @entity25 tool " that monitors @entity16 and media across the web for political candidate mentions , revealing trends and spikes that show where the conversation is and why			2
" it claims that " growth in the numbers of legitimate followers or a high recurrence of retweets are both indicative of growing grass - roots support			1
actually , growth in followers or high numbers of retweets are just an indication of notoriety or celebrity			1
saying simple , stupid things that lots of people want to tell their peers about can get you tons of followers and retweets			1
but it does n't mean anything definitive about grass - roots support			1
otherwise , right now we 'd be talking about @entity59 's amazing victory in @entity60			2
( need i remind you of when he was getting headlines topping the @entity18 " buzz " charts ) these are empty information calories , to borrow a phrase from @entity69 's timely new book , @entity70			1
eat them at your own risk , for they can make you really dumb			0
this is n't to say that campaigns should ignore social media , or that efforts by voters to influence the election by organizing online are pointless			2
but just because you can count something and chart it does n't mean you 've proven anything			1
take , for example , @entity84 's 1.4 million @entity16 followers			2
on @entity87 , @entity86 demolishes the notion that this means he 's popular among @entity20			2
half of those accounts are n't in the @entity91			2
and half of all @entity16 accounts are n't even active			0
@entity84 's numbers are a sign of online longevity and notoriety , not much more			0
@entity99 's late surge in @entity60 should also put the mania for tracking online buzz into perspective			1
all of last year , he trailed the pack online			0
meanwhile , he worked @entity60 the old - fashioned way and did his best to tap into a social network that is more locally rooted than anything @entity18 or @entity16 has to offer			0
that is , the evangelical church			0
as the other candidates with a claim on that community started to fall away , @entity99 's fortunes started to rise			1
and then in late december he got really lucky , sidestepping the negative attention and negative advertising that battered some of the other top - tier candidates while peaking at just the right time			0
now the issue is n't how many new followers @entity99 may get online , but how well he engages them and converts these low - level indications of interest into money , volunteers and votes			1
so far , the tidings are n't great			0
as my colleagues @entity129 and @entity130 pointed out yesterday , @entity99 's website was n't quite up to the task of handling the burst of traffic he earned tuesday night , potentially costing him millions in overnight donations			1
nor does his site offer supporters a way to self - organize , the way @entity140 or @entity141 invites supporters to start their own profile pages or set up their own house parties and fundraisers			0
( and i have n't even mentioned the @entity99 campaign 's failure to successfully address his " @entity149 problem , " which @entity151 's @entity150 dissects at great length today			1
) online politics is complicated and requires a level of technological literacy that most people , reporters included , simply lack			0
so as you encounter breathless headlines about the role of social media in the 2012 election , or how the race is going to be won or lost on @entity18 or @entity16 or whatever , just remember this : a link , or a follow , or a retweet , is about as meaningful as a glance or a nod			0
it 's an indication of fairly low - level interest , nothing more			1
organizing all those glances or nods into something powerful -- that 's what really matters			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity179 : growth in followers and retweets are signs of low - level interest
counting something and charting it does n't mean you 've proven anything , he says
@entity192 : @entity99 's surge should put the mania for buzz - tracking into perspective
