let me say at the start that there is no way around the topic of nakedness in front of your children without getting personal and slightly uncomfortable			1
i 'm already feeling somewhat tense as i type this			0
i joke that the only person who should have to see me naked is my husband			1
he signed up for it , right ? my kids certainly did n't			1
a lifetime of body image issues means i 'm not one to walk around naked at home			1
but i do n't cover up around my daughters , 7 and 8 , when i 'm getting dressed or in the bathroom , either			0
i do n't want them to think there is anything wrong with my body or theirs			0
and when they ask hilarious questions such as " @entity26 , why do your boobs hang ? , " i ca n't help but laugh and use the opportunity as a chance to tell them my body has changed over time and theirs will , too			1
' brutally honest ' : when is it ok to leave your teen home alone overnight ? in conversations over email with mothers and fathers across the country and in @entity44 , it 's clear there is no " one size fits all ' " approach to the questions of whether it 's ok to be naked in front of your kids and if there 's an age when it 's no longer ok			1
@entity56 , a mother of three , says ever since her children , now 20 , 13 and 13 , were little , she and her husband have been teaching them not to be ashamed of their bodies			0
they have also never hidden their bodies from their kids , she said			2
" as they get older , my husband is more discreet around our daughters and i am more discreet around our son			0
not because we are uncomfortable , but because they may be , " said @entity56 , a real estate agent in @entity68 , @entity69			0
" so when it is time for me to undress , i tell whichever of my kids is in my room talking to me , that i plan to do so and they have the option to leave			2
" ' brutally honest ' : what if you do n't like your kids ' friends ? comfort is key a common theme i heard from parents is comfort			1
if both you and your children are comfortable with you being naked in front of them , there is n't anything " inherently wrong with that at all , " said @entity92 , who says her 8 - year - old son is used to seeing her and her husband naked on occasion when they are getting dressed or in the shower			1
" if my son were ever to say or even act as if he was uncomfortable by it , we would of course respect that , " said @entity102 , editor of the motherhood anthology " @entity104 : redefining @entity105 to fit reality " and founder of the blog @entity109			0
" @entity110 , when it 's within your home and 100 % nonsexualized , is n't going to traumatize a child , especially if you 're all on the same page , are all consenting and are all comfortable with it			2
" @entity116 , a @entity117 mom of two middle schoolers , said while every child is different , most kids make it clear when their mom or dad 's nudity no longer works for them			1
' brutally honest ' : mean girls are getting younger " i think your kids let you know when it 's time to stop being naked in front of them -- usually about the time they decide they do n't want to be naked in front of you , " said @entity127 , co-founder of the video sharing site for tweens called @entity130			1
as children age , they certainly develop their own sense of modesty around others , said @entity145 , a mom of two in @entity148 , @entity149 , and founder of @entity151			0
" but even my 12 - year - old son does n't hesitate to undress in front of me			2
i figure that he will one day , and that 's ok , " said @entity145			2
" perhaps one day he will avert his eyes or become uncomfortable with my nudity as well			2
and that 's ok , too			2
" @entity158 , a mom of three boys in @entity160 , @entity161 , said she reached a point with each of her sons , usually no later than age 5 , when she thought it was no longer ok to be nude around them			0
" i began to feel uncomfortable being naked in front of them because of the questions and the poking and prodding and search for @entity173 's ' inside penis ' -- that 's what they thought a vagina was , " said @entity158 , founder of the blog @entity26			1
" i do n't think it makes them terrible people or scars them for life if they stumble into the bathroom while i 'm going , but it 's easily avoidable awkwardness none of us really needs to experience on a daily basis			2
" @entity189 , a divorced father of three , puts himself solidly in the no - being - naked - in - front - of - kids ' camp			1
" it would be very difficult to teach children any sort of modesty and humility if a parent thought it ok to be naked in front of their children			1
it also would bring up questions and conversations they might not be ready to handle , " he said			2
blogger : why i want my sons to see me naked a few months back , a post by blogger @entity210 about why she wants her four sons -- ages 2 , 5 , 6 and 9 -- to see her naked , was republished on the @entity213 and went viral			2
@entity210 said she wanted her sons to see what " real " women look like before they are bombarded with an ideal in the media that does n't match reality			0
" before they are exposed to boobs that are as round and firm as cantaloupes and pictures of taut , airbrushed , dimple-less butts , i 'm exposing them to a different kind of female body			0
mine , " wrote @entity210 , who blogs at fighting off @entity231			0
her words led to an onslaught of hate mail , nasty tweets and accusations she 's sexualizing her sons , she said			0
@entity238 , a father of two boys in @entity240 , wrote a blog post of his own in part as a response to all the outrage			0
he says he has been playing games called " naked baby " and " naked daddy " at bath time since his children were little while at the same time he teaches his kids not to stare when they are in the open shower in the men 's bathroom at their neighborhood pool			1
" @entity210 's doing what works for ( her )			0
i 'm doing what works for me			0
you 're doing what works for you			0
and we 're all just trying to teach our kids a little respect for each other , and themselves , " said @entity238 , who writes about parenting on his blog @entity262			1
there does n't seem to be much science to help guide us on whether it 's better or worse for your child , or it makes no difference at all , if they see you naked			1
i could n't find many studies when i searched for them , and those i found had conflicting findings			1
for instance , one study found no negative impact on adolescents who regularly saw their parents naked at ages 3 and 6 , but another study found that parental nudity when kids were ages 6 to 11 resulted in more permissive attitudes about sex and increased sexual frequency			1
for some parents , like @entity292 , a mom of two young girls on @entity294 , who only wanted to use her first name , it 's all about convenience			1
" i 'll be honest			0
sometimes it 's easier and faster just to pull them into the shower with me , " she said			0
" but my girls are 4 and 6			0
a year from now i may not be doing it any longer			0
by then , they may be showering by themselves ( dare to hope ? ) " do you think it 's ok to be naked in front of your kids ? share your thoughts with @entity311 on @entity312 or @entity313 on @entity314 .			1

in " @entity317 " video *series* , @entity311 tackles *provocative* parenting questions
there is no one size fits all answer to whether it 's ok to be naked in front of your kids , parents say
studies show conflicting findings on the impact of parental nudity on kids
