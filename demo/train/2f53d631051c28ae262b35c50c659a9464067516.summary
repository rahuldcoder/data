-- following this week 's revelation that @entity2 penned a crime thriller under the pseudonym @entity2 , the " @entity5 " creator has joined a long line of women who have written novels under a cloak of masculinity			1
while some authors choose to write under a pen name as a form of artistic expression , many female authors purposefully opt for a male pseudonym to appeal to a wider audience , says @entity18 , author of " nom de plume : a ( secret ) history of pseudonyms "			1
" sadly in certain genres , it still helps to be a man -- particularly in crime or science fiction , " @entity18 told @entity0			1
" sometimes it 's easier to be taken seriously as a man , and @entity2 is in a difficult position as her reputation means that her work ca n't be judged on merit alone , " she adds			1
with @entity2 's book " @entity33 " climbing the charts on @entity36 bestselling list , @entity0 takes a look at renowned female writers , past and present , who have adopted male pen names			1
@entity40 ( @entity41 ) best known for her seminal tale " @entity45 " , @entity40 , spent much of her early career writing under the nom de plume @entity40			0
featuring feisty women who did not conform to the ideal of the 19th century female , her early novels " @entity47 " and " @entity48 " were hidden beneath an ambiguous pseudonym , giving @entity40 the artistic license to explore different conceptions of the fairer sex without fear of disapproval			1
this darker literary alter ego confronted racier themes , and was discovered more than 50 years after @entity40 's death by book dealer @entity61 in 1942			2
letters between the author and a @entity66 publisher in 1855 and 1856 read , " we would like more stories from you ... and if you prefer you may use the pseudonym of @entity70 or any other man 's name if you will			1
" @entity73 ( @entity73 ) after a highly successful career as a novelist under her own name , @entity73 decided to adopt a more elusive tag for her " ... in @entity81 " collection : a canon comprising of 43 published works , with three more set for release later this year			0
unlike @entity2 's quick reveal -- a mere three months after joining the literary world as @entity2 -- @entity73 kept her pen name under wraps until the 12th installment of her romantic thriller series			1
@entity89 ( @entity89 ) famed for her novels exploring psychological realism , @entity89 -- better known to the literary world as @entity89 -- was not short of opinions on fellow female writers			0
publishing an essay in 1856 entitled " @entity98 , " @entity96 lambasted the glut of unremarkable work produced by women in the era , which she believed diminished the credibility of female writers as a whole			0
it was this that spurred the " @entity111 " writer on to use a male pseudonym , musing : " by a peculiar thermometric adjustment , when a woman 's talent is at zero , journalistic approbation is at the boiling pitch ; when it attains mediocrity it is already no more than summer heat ; and if she ever reaches excellence , critical enthusiasm drops to the freezing point			1
" @entity125 and @entity126 ( @entity127 ) " @entity130 " came across as a rather intriguing debut novel from novice author @entity127 when it was published in 2012			0
but it was soon revealed that the brains behind the book were @entity126 , an actress and author , and @entity125 , a journalist and tv producer			2
citing themselves as @entity127 's ' wranglers , ' the duo maintains his existence as an mysterious enigma , even ' interviewing ' him for their blog			0
explaining their decision to adopt a single fictitious name for themselves , @entity126 said : " we had both read a raft of articles talking about how men do n't buy books written by women			0
" they may have been proven correct , as their first novel has spawned a successful sequel with the male nom de plume still intact			0
the @entity160 ( @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 ) perhaps the most successful literary dynasty of all time , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity163 collectively produced some of the world 's best loved novels during the 19th century			0
publishing works under male names beginning with the same first letter as their own , @entity162 , @entity161 and @entity163 produced their first offering -- a collection of poems -- in 1846 , before going on to publish individual novels shortly after			2
" @entity164 really believed in their talents , and was actually very controlling about the publication of their work , " says @entity18			2
" she was incredibly bold for an unmarried woman , but she was determined that they would publish as men in order to get reviews that would n't be condescending			0

@entity2 is the latest female writer to publish under a male pseudonym
author @entity18 says in some genres it 's easier to be taken seriously as man
revealed after only three months , @entity2 *wanted* to keep the pseudonym under wraps
