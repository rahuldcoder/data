-- @entity0 's @entity1 interviewed @entity2 of @entity3 to the @entity4 about the recent murder of dr. @entity6 , whose women 's clinic frequently took center stage in the debate over abortion			1
@entity6 was shot and killed while serving as an usher at his @entity14 , @entity15 , church sunday morning , according to police			0
below is a transcript of @entity2 's interview			1
@entity1 : @entity2 , first off -- tell me about your group , and what you guys do and the name of it			1
we are @entity3 for the @entity4			0
there [ are ] a number of @entity3 of @entity4			0
the group in @entity31 is our judiciary of preborn			1
and we speak up for preborn child in different venues including the abortion rallies and on the street , political venues			1
and media types and venues like we are doing right now			2
@entity1 : when you heard the news over the weekend about the abortion doctor -- that i 'm sure you are well aware of -- was shot and killed , what was your reaction ? @entity2 : i was cheered by it because i knew that he would n't be killing any more babies			1
and i expect that would happen when all legal and moral -- legal ways of trying to stop it has been exhausted , as they have tried to prosecute him for giving abortions to people in violation of @entity15 law			0
@entity1 : when you say you were cheered by it , is there any inconsistency in your thought in that you are trying to protect life and at the same time here 's this doctor who was shot and killed and in your own words you are cheered by that ? @entity2 : no , because i 'm protecting innocent life			1
i 'm not -- and the doctor or the abortionist is guilty of murder as far as i 'm concerned			0
it 's no different for him to be killing a preborn child or a post-born child			0
the preborn child is entitled to the same rights , privileges and protections as a post-born child			0
@entity1 : so , you support this killing ? @entity2 : i do n't advocate it , i do n't support it			1
but i do n't condemn it , and i believe that what he did was justifiable			0
@entity1 : you told me earlier that he -- meaning the shooter -- he did what the law should have done ? @entity2 : right , exactly			2
the law should have protected the preborn child ; and the law is supposed to execute vengeance , you know , in protecting the child			0
but what the man did was not execute vengeance , as far as i 'm concerned			0
he was protecting preborn children , ones that are slated for abortion today and the future			1
i do n't feel that what he did is vengeance			0
@entity1 : do you seek this fate on all doctors performing abortions out there ? @entity2 : i believe that all abortionists are deserving of death , and they are not the only ones			1
there are politicians and judges and others who support this murder that are also deserving of death			1
@entity1 : would you care to name names , @entity2 ? @entity2 : @entity122 , @entity123			2
any politician that gives our tax money to @entity128 and organizations that kill babies are participating in the killing of innocent children deserve the same penalty			1
and you , again , stage a weekly protest at a @entity128 in @entity136			0
your wife has been banned from doing that ? @entity2 : right			2
she has a -- they -- she 's received an injunction from being there			0
@entity1 : but you will be there this wednesday ? @entity2 : i will be there this wednesday			2
@entity1 : and you were at @entity147 ? @entity2 : yes , and we were at [ unintelligible ] before that			2
well , @entity2 , thank you so much for the interview .			2

@entity2 says his group speaks for preborn children in different venues
@entity2 : " i believe all abortionists are deserving of death "
@entity2 : politicians who give tax money to groups that do abortions deserve death
