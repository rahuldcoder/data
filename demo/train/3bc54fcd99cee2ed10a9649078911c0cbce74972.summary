-- president @entity1 says he is n't bluffing when he says @entity2 should n't have a nuclear weapon , but he cautions against an @entity5 strike against the @entity7 republic			1
" at a time when there is not a lot of sympathy for @entity2 and its only real ally , ( @entity15 ) is on the ropes , do we want a distraction in which suddenly @entity2 can portray itself as a victim ? " he said this week in an interview with the @entity9			1
@entity1 , who is to meet monday with @entity5 prime minister @entity20 , said a permanent solution is necessary			1
" the only way historically that a country has ultimately decided not to get nuclear weapons without constant military intervention has been when they themselves take ( nuclear weapons ) off the table , " @entity1 said			1
" that 's what happened in @entity32 , that 's what happened in @entity34			2
" @entity1 said @entity2 and @entity5 understand that he is n't bluffing about his opposition to an @entity2 nuclear weapon			1
" i think that the @entity5 government recognizes that , as president of the @entity39 , i do n't bluff , " he said			2
" i also do n't , as a matter of sound policy , go around advertising exactly what our intentions are			0
but i think both the @entity2 and the @entity5 governments recognize that , when the @entity39 says it is unacceptable for @entity2 to have a nuclear weapon , we mean what we say			1
" @entity2 officials have insisted their nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes			1
but their statements have not persuaded @entity53 or @entity5			0
@entity1 said he 's not going to take " any option " off the table and will pressure @entity2 until it " takes a different course			1
" he stressed the importance of political , diplomatic and economic sanctions against @entity2			2
he said the @entity59 has a " sanctions architecture that is far more effective than anybody anticipated " and tough sanctions " put a world of hurt on them			0
" he also said that a transition to " a peaceful and stable and representative @entity15 government " from the @entity70 regime would be " a profound loss for @entity2			1
" " preventing @entity2 from getting a nuclear weapon is n't just in the interest of @entity5 , it is profoundly in the security interests of the @entity39 , " he said			1
@entity1 said that @entity2 's gain of a nuclear weapons would " run completely contrary to my policies of nonproliferation			1
" " the risks of an @entity2 nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terrorist organizations are profound			1
it is almost certain that other players in the region would feel it necessary to get their own nuclear weapons , " @entity1 said			1
" so now you have the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world , one that is rife with unstable governments and sectarian tensions			2
and it would also provide @entity2 the additional capability to sponsor and protect its proxies in carrying out terrorist attacks because they are less fearful of retaliation			1
" @entity20 said three years ago that @entity2 was being led by a " messianic apocalyptic cult			1
" gen. @entity103 , chairman of the @entity104 , has called the leadership " rational			0
" the interviewer , @entity106 , asked where @entity1 fell " on this continuum			2
" " there is no doubt they are isolated , " the president said			2
" they have a very ingrown political system			0
they are founded and fueled on hostility towards the @entity39 , @entity5 and , to some degree , the @entity59			0
and they have shown themselves willing to go outside international norms and international rules to achieve their objectives			0
all of this makes them dangerous			2
they 've also been willing to crush opposition in their own country in brutal and bloody ways			0
" i think it 's entirely legitimate to say that this is a regime that does not share our world view or our values			2
i do think , and this is what @entity103 was probably referring to , that as we look at how they operate and the decisions they 've made over the past three decades , that they care about the regime 's survival			0
they 're sensitive to the opinions of the people and they are troubled by the isolation that they 're experiencing			0
" @entity1 said @entity20 has a " profound responsibility to protect " @entity5 , given the @entity152 and anti-semitism			1
" i think it 's important to recognize , though , that the prime minister is also head of a modern state that is mindful of the profound costs of any military action , and in our consultations with the @entity5 government , i think they take those costs , and potential unintended consequences , very seriously , " @entity1 said			1
there have been reports of friction between @entity1 and @entity20			1
the president was asked if they are friends and talk about matters other than business			0
" the prime minister and i come out of different political traditions			0
this is one of the few times in the history of @entity39 - @entity5 relations where you have a government from the right in @entity5 at the same time you have a center - left government in the @entity39 , and so i think what happens then is that a lot of political interpretations of our relationship get projected onto this , " he said			0
@entity1 said he and @entity20 " can be very frank with each other , very blunt with each other , very honest with each other			1
" " for the most part , when we have differences , they are tactical and not strategic			0
our objectives are a secure @entity39 , a secure @entity5 , peace , the capacity for our kids to grow up in safety and security and not have to worry about bombs going off , and being able to promote business and economic growth and commerce			0
" @entity1 has been criticized by some for not adequately supporting @entity5 's security interests , but he said , " we 've never had closer military and intelligence cooperation			1
" " when you look at what i 've done with respect to security for @entity5 , from joint training and joint exercises that outstrip anything that 's been done in the past , to helping finance and construct the @entity218 program to make sure that @entity5 families are less vulnerable to missile strikes , to ensuring that @entity5 maintains its qualitative military edge , to fighting back against delegitimization of @entity5 , whether at the ( @entity224 ) @entity223 , or in front of the @entity226 , or during the @entity227 , or after the flare - up involving the flotilla -- the truth of the matter is that the relationship has functioned very well , " @entity1 said			1
" flotilla " was a reference to @entity5 's raid on a @entity236 - bound flotilla that left nine people dead			0
the @entity227 was a controversial assessment of @entity5 's @entity236 offensive			0
@entity1 said " there 's no good reason to doubt " him			1
" why is it that despite me never failing to support @entity5 on every single problem that they 've had over the last three years , that there are still questions about that ? " some of it has to do with the fact that in this country and in our media , this gets wrapped up with politics			0
and i do n't think that 's any secret			0
and if you have a set of political actors who want to see if they can drive a wedge , not between the @entity39 and @entity5 , but between @entity1 and a @entity263 - @entity39 vote that has historically been very supportive of his candidacy , then it 's good to try to fan doubts and raise questions , " he said			1
@entity1 cited his " full - throated defense of @entity5 " before the @entity226 as an example			2
" our goals are in sync			0
and historically , one of the reasons that the @entity39 - @entity5 relationship has survived so well and thrived is shared values , shared history , the links between our peoples			0
but it 's also been because it has been a profoundly bipartisan commitment to the state of @entity5			0
and the flip side of it is that , in terms of @entity5 politics , there 's been a view that , regardless of whether it 's a @entity291 or @entity292 administration , the working assumption is : we 've got @entity5 's back			0
and that 's something that i constantly try to reinforce and remind people of			0
" the president also countered those voices who say he is n't up to using military power to stop @entity2			1
" if people want to say about me that i have a profound preference for peace over war , that every time i order young men and women into a combat theater and then see the consequences on some of them , if they 're lucky enough to come back , that this weighs on me -- i make no apologies for that			2
because anybody who is sitting in my chair who is n't mindful of the costs of war should n't be here , because it 's serious business			0
these are n't video games that we 're playing here			0
" but @entity1 said the record shows he 's willing to take military action when necessary , citing the killing of @entity326 leader @entity325 and actions against the @entity328			1
drone strikes have been used regularly against militants along the @entity333 - @entity332 border during @entity1 's term			2
" so aside from the usual politics , i do n't think this is an argument that has a lot of legs , " @entity1 said			2
for his part , @entity20 said friday that any long - term talks with @entity2 on the state of its nuclear program would likely go nowhere			1
" it could pursue or exploit the talks as they 've done in the past to deceive and delay so that they can continue to advance their nuclear program and get to the nuclear finish line by running up the clock , " he said			0
the @entity5 prime minister was in @entity351 ahead of his planned meeting next week with @entity1			2
@entity20 repeated that @entity5 reserves the right to defend itself against @entity2 threats , leaving a unilateral , pre-emptive , military strike as a possibility			1
" this is a very dangerous time , actually , " said @entity357 , a @entity358 analyst and director of the @entity360 at the @entity361			1
for example , should @entity2 , right after these parliamentary elections , think that an @entity5 military strike is certain in the next few months , there is some incentive to go first			2
" @entity0 's @entity369 contributed to this report .			0

@entity372 : " this is a dangerous time , actually , " says @entity358 analyst
the president is set to meet with @entity20
" it 's unacceptable for @entity2 to have a nuclear weapon , " @entity1 says
the risk of an @entity2 weapon falling into terrorist hands is " profound , " he says
