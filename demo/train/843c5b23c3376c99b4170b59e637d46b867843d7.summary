editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior political analyst for @entity3 , appearing regularly on @entity3 's " @entity4 , " " @entity5 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity7 , " as well as special event coverage			1
@entity2 says @entity9 seem to be aiding the @entity10 in its attempt to defeat president @entity12 on health care			1
@entity14 ( @entity3 ) -- it 's always hard to be optimistic about the passage of any kind of health care reform			1
after all , history shows that for much of the past century , most attempts to reform the system have failed			2
there have been some exceptions -- such as @entity24 in 1965			0
but , for the most part , the political will has been insufficient to move anything			0
here 's where you have to give president @entity12 credit : he promised health care reform during the campaign , and he 's trying to do what he said he would do			1
( he 's also trying to do almost everything else he promised in the campaign at the same time , but that 's another story			0
) he has held health care symposiums and town halls , met with recalcitrant conservatives and moderates , and kept tabs with congressional leaders on their progress			1
and wednesday night , he 'll take the issue to the country in a prime - time press conference			2
the strategy was forthright : since the country has debated this issue for decades , there 's no need to redo it all			2
and do n't write a bill like @entity53 did so @entity54 can spend its time picking it apart			0
rather , let the committees ( five in all ) move their bills and reconcile them until the @entity59 and @entity60 each has a product			0
the president weighs in when the two chambers try to reach agreement on a final bill			0
@entity66 , health care reform			1
ah , but this is @entity54 we 're talking about			0
should it be any surprise that some congressional @entity9 -- having suffered in the minority under a @entity10 president -- have decided to unleash their inner liberal ? no matter how badly the @entity10 opposition behaves -- and no matter how bereft it is of ideas of its own -- the @entity9 seem happy to aid @entity10 in their one clear goal for @entity12 : defeat			1
the president has called for cost controls above all else in health care reform			1
he even wants to take @entity24 spending decisions out of the political arena and put them in the hands of the docs and technical nerds , who actually understand where real cost savings can be found			0
but that would require @entity54 to relinquish some power , so it has n't happened			0
instead , @entity12 's democrats have so far given him higher costs ( according to the @entity95 ) and higher taxes			1
or , in technical parlance , the same - old , same - old			0
one @entity59 version of health reform passed last week proposed a surtax on households with adjusted gross incomes of more than $ 350,000			1
it was enough to prompt an intervention by house speaker @entity105 , who changed it to $ 1 million for joint filers -- so it could be called a millionaire 's tax			0
have they asked @entity12 -- the change agent -- whether he really wants @entity9 to get back into that old class warfare argument ? the trouble for @entity12 is that he 's getting tethered to some of the bad ideas the @entity9 propose because he has n't denounced them			1
we know that he 's cool and patient , but maybe his drooping recent poll numbers will cause him to start drawing some lines in the sand			0
@entity120 still like their new president , but they 're clearly wondering why he has let congressional @entity9 inhabit his body			2
in a recent @entity128 poll , for instance , approval of his handling of health care has slid from 57 percent to 49 percent since april			1
and the @entity9 ' foray into taxing the rich has n't done @entity12 any favors , either : just one month ago , voters earning more than $ 50,000 liked @entity12 more than the @entity10 on health care by a 2 - 1 margin			1
today , those voters are evenly split			0
and independent voters -- the key to @entity12 's electoral success -- are leaving the flock			2
in april , 57 percent of independents approved his handling of health care ; that has now dipped to 44 percent , and 49 percent disapprove			1
all of which is not catastrophic , but it is a problem			0
and it 's not a problem the @entity10 have created for @entity12 , although they will no doubt try and take credit			2
in truth , it 's something the @entity9 have done all by themselves			2
during the campaign , candidate @entity12 waxed eloquent on the importance of bipartisanship , of turning the page on the politics of the past			2
" we need to stop the partisan point scoring and the petty bickering that serves the needs of politicians but not the needs of the @entity120 people , " he said in september in @entity157 , @entity158			0
" ... i 'm running for president because that 's the kind of leadership we need right now			0
and how about telling that to the @entity9 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : health care reform is always tough to accomplish
@entity2 says @entity9 are making it tougher by raising costs and taxes on rich
she says @entity12 needs to cut links to @entity9 ' *unpopular* ideas
@entity2 : people on both sides have to work together on the issue
