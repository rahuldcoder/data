-- with a star - studded client list that includes @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , @entity1 is an internationally known fashion designer			1
starting out with a boutique store in @entity14 , @entity15 , during the mid- 1980s , @entity8 's ascent onto the fashion stage -- and the front covers of @entity11 and @entity12 -- is made more remarkable by the fact that she never received any formal training as either a designer or seamstress			1
instead , @entity8 relied on her self - confessed " obsession " for detail , as well as a natural eye for fashion			1
" i was born a fashion designer " she says , and soon after she set up shop , her clothes acquired a reputation for their bold use of pattern and intricate stitching			1
@entity8 took up the " @entity34 " challenge to travel from @entity15 to @entity35 , @entity36 's capital			1
although it 's a city she had been to on business many times before , she says that she 'd never allowed herself the time to study its traditional dress in earnest			1
see more @entity44 there she was tasked with creating a new fashion line that would combine her own sophisticated modern style with the vibrant , brightly colored traditions of @entity36 dress - making			1
in her own words , @entity8 retraces the footsteps of her @entity34			1
@entity1 : i absolutely adore the historical aspect of clothing			1
my ranges are full of influences from 19th - century @entity57 , @entity58 , even @entity60 vintage styles			2
so it 's no surprise i have always enjoyed combing through flea markets in small towns and finding rare antique gems to steal some inspiration			2
i 'm also obsessed with detail , so when i find a @entity69 gown or a 50s bridal slip that i like , then it 's important for me to be able to emulate the exact stitching , embroidery or beading used at the time			2
in the @entity79 , unfortunately , most of our expert hand - stitching traditions have been lost -- the skills have not been passed on and the seamstress geniuses from the couture houses of @entity83 have not been replaced			0
that is why i 'm often traveling to @entity36			0
it 's one of the very best places in the world to find that expertise still thriving			2
from one village to the next you find whole families , generations , that have their own specialties of stitch work			0
honestly , i can give them any old historical piece that i 've found and they will either take it away and recreate it almost perfectly , or they 'll say " hmmm ... i do n't know this stitching , but i know a place nearby that does			0
" it 's a fashion designer 's dream ! so in one sense , i 've been fusing my clothes with @entity36 influences for a while			1
however , i think this was the first time i 've traveled to @entity36 with a conscious intention to create a fusion of styles : their own traditional dress with my more modern , western creations			1
i just love the color and the vibrancy that is @entity36			0
@entity35 is exciting and chaotic and noisy and dusty and smoky and hot			1
everything is so full of intense color and i realized that , on a subconscious level at least , i 've been influenced by @entity36 style ... in fact , when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich , deep dyes , how can anyone deny the huge influence of @entity36 on fashion around the world ? read related : dancing to the music of love in @entity131 walking through the streets , you see color combinations that you 'd never imagine would work			2
i recall a beautiful woman wearing a sari in bright , radiant pink mixed with a lime green print			0
i mean , lime and pink ! it sounds garish , but on her , with the quality of the dye and the way the colors had been combined it looked absolutely stunning			0
we made our way to a shop that i can only describe as a treasure trove of fabrics and other goodies			0
this was the place to find all the accessories , textiles , ribbons , bows , buttons , and beads that i could take back to my studio in @entity14 to use as inspiration for the final creations			0
there were ideas there , old and new , that i 'd never thought about			0
already i could envisage opportunities to use all sorts of different laces and braids , detailed examples of hand stitching , with some other antique dresses we 'd picked up from a local supplier			0
much as i love them personally , i do n't sell things like saris -- and i never would -- it 's not a style that would appeal to the tastes of my particular customers			2
however , what i took back to @entity15 , was their techniques , their intense celebratory colors , their detailed embellishments , their expert use of beads and sequins			1
i worked on the new line for many months , and these are the elements i hope i managed to incorporate into them			0
i think they 've added an opulence , a romance			2
but i 'll only know i have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that , no matter what , they have to have it			0
the garment takes them on a journey , and so my journey with the garment has finished .			0

@entity15 fashion designer @entity1 flew to @entity35 *seeking* new styles
@entity8 was drawn to the city 's tradition of *flamboyantly* colored clothes
she says that the journey helped her create a line of clothing fused with opulence and romance
