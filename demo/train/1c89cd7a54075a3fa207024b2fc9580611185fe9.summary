@entity0 -- the news was devastating for @entity3 and @entity4 : their 19 - year - old son , marine lance cpl. @entity5 , died in @entity8 's @entity7			0
the @entity11 , @entity12 , couple learned the survivor benefit paid to the families of fallen troops for burial and other expenses had been suspended because of the government shutdown			1
her sadness , @entity19 says , was compounded by worry and questions about how to pay off the debt			2
it 's a question that embarrassed and outraged government officials , who scrambled to find a way to provide the survivor benefits to the families of 26 troops who have died since the shutdown began on october 1			1
on wednesday , the @entity32 struck a deal with a private charity to ensure families of fallen troops are paid the survivor benefits , which include a $ 100,000 payment made within days of the death , defense secretary @entity31 said			1
the government will reimburse the @entity43 - based @entity42 once the shutdown is over , @entity40 said in a written statement			1
@entity42 founder no stranger to service members in need " i am offended , outraged , and embarrassed that the government shutdown had prevented the @entity32 from fulfilling this most sacred responsibility in a timely manner , " @entity40 said			1
" in the days before the shutdown , we warned @entity55 and the @entity57 people that ( the @entity32 ) would not have the legal authority to make these payments during a lapse in appropriations			1
" the announcement came just after the @entity63 voted unanimously to resume paying survivor benefits			2
it was unclear whether the @entity66 would take up the bill , given that a legislative fix may now not be necessary			0
president @entity69 ordered administration officials on wednesday to find an immediate solution			2
" the president was very disturbed to learn of this problem , and he directed the @entity32 to work with the @entity75 and his lawyers to develop a possible solution , and he expects this to be fixed today , " @entity73 spokesman @entity72 said			1
the survivors benefit includes funeral and burial reimbursements			2
it also includes a gratuity for travel to funeral or memorial services -- or to be at @entity86 , where remains of those troops who died overseas typically go			0
as the debate swirled around how to restore the military death benefits , @entity40 traveled to @entity86 for the arrival of the bodies of four soldiers killed sunday when insurgents attacked their unit with a improvised explosive device in @entity8 's @entity97			2
@entity100 , 24 , of @entity101 , @entity102 ; 1st lt. @entity103 , 25 , of @entity104 , @entity105 ; sgt. @entity106 , 25 , of @entity107 , @entity108 ; and sgt. @entity109 , 24 , of @entity110 , @entity111			0
it is rare for the defense secretary to attend a ceremony for the return of the soldiers , but @entity40 's appearance appeared to send a strong message about the government shutdown			2
@entity72 said the payments were not specifically addressed in legislation to ensure military personnel would be paid during any shutdown			0
he did not elaborate on what the solution might be			0
it 's unclear exactly when @entity69 learned of the situation , which reporters were briefed about four days before the shutdown began			0
at the briefing wednesday , @entity72 refused to say when the president learned benefits were being delayed			2
" i do n't know specifically , " he said			0
a senior @entity32 official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity1 that @entity40 warned senior @entity73 officials and some in @entity55 days ago -- before the shutdown began -- that death benefits would not be paid families of fallen troops during the shutdown			1
on september 27 , @entity32 comptroller @entity142 told reporters at a @entity32 briefing that death gratuities would be one of the things held up by a shutdown			1
" this is ghoulish , but it 's the law , not policy , " he said			0
if the death occurred after the lapse took place , then the money would be obligated after the lapse took place , and we would have no authority to pay based on that money until the lapse ended			2
so in that case , they could be delayed			0
" it 's the " worst nightmare " for military families , said @entity167 of @entity168 , a support network for families of the fallen			0
5 crazy side effects from the shutdown before the @entity32 worked out a deal , @entity42 -- a group that helps the families of troops in need -- offered an advance grant to families of the fallen during the shutdown , according to a letter sent tuesday from sen. @entity182 , @entity183 , to @entity40			1
even as the @entity32 entered into a contract wednesday with @entity42 , both sides in @entity0 were blaming the other			1
the holdup on death benefit payments is just one issue affecting military families because of the shutdown			1
child - care programs have been scratched , subsidized military grocery stores are closed , nonessential medical care has been cut back , and kids ' sports programs have been canceled , @entity192 reports			0
" the president is the commander in chief			0
he should not be using troops and their families as pawns in this political bickering , " rep. @entity199 , @entity108 , said on the @entity42 floor			1
" he should be doing everything he can to stand up for the men and women of our military			0
instead , he is refusing to negotiate until he gets his way			0
" sen. @entity211 , @entity212 , said : " should n't we be embarrassed about this ? should n't we be ashamed ? " meanwhile , the members - only gym at the @entity42 remains open			1
" the electricity , the hot water , the towels -- they are not provided by gym fairies , " rep. @entity217 , @entity218 , said wednesday , calling , on the @entity42 floor , for the gym to be closed			1
" they are provided by taxpayers			0
" " some of the most fanatic about inflicting unnecessary pain on the @entity57 public are regulars , enjoying our @entity42 gym while the staff gym is closed , " he said			1
