days ahead of a deadline to strike a deal , @entity1 's foreign minister engaged friday in what @entity5 's top diplomat deemed " complex " but " useful discussions " on @entity10 's controversial nuclear program that -- despite positive vibes on both sides -- have yet to produce a breakthrough			1
" there are still significant gaps , " @entity5 foreign secretary @entity14 said from @entity15			1
" ... we are going away for technical discussions			0
" one person who was n't going away -- or at least leaving @entity15 -- was @entity1 foreign minister @entity21			1
@entity21 met for a second time in recent days with @entity24 secretary of state @entity23 and the @entity26 's foreign policy chief , @entity25			1
his next meetings were with @entity14 and @entity29 foreign minister @entity28			2
the @entity1 minister once planned to return to @entity10 on friday night to consult with leaders there			2
but a member of his delegation said that , for the moment , the @entity1 minister had no plans to leave @entity35			2
there 's a lot at stake ahead of a november 24 deadline for the @entity24 and five other world powers to reach an agreement with @entity1 over the @entity44 nation 's nuclear program			1
@entity1 and the group known as the @entity46 -- consisting of @entity47 , the @entity24 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity29 and @entity5 , the latter five being permanent members of the @entity51 -- agreed last february on a framework for comprehensive negotiations over @entity10 's nuclear program			1
@entity46 and @entity1 agree on nuclear negotiation framework in july , they agreed to a four - month extension of those negotiations -- another positive step , but still anything but a long - term agreement to put the issue to rest			2
a deal could mean an end to significant sanctions against @entity10 and an opening up of the country to the @entity68 , a transition that would have begun with the june 2013 election of @entity71 as @entity1 's president			1
the lack of a deal could further inflame tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- perhaps more sanctions or even military strikes or a confrontation of some sort			0
@entity1 has insisted that like other countries , it has a right to develop nuclear power			0
western powers have accused @entity1 of not being forthright enough and trying to develop not just nuclear power , but nuclear weapons as well			0
to this point , the head of the @entity88 , who is not part of @entity15 talks , said thursday that @entity1 authorities are continuing to deny his agency access to a sensitive military complex suspected of being a site of nuclear activities			0
" @entity1 has not provided any explanations that enable the @entity88 to clarify the outstanding practical measures , nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the @entity103 , despite several requests from the @entity88 , " @entity98 said from @entity35			0
@entity23 , @entity24 's top diplomat , talked by phone with @entity107 , his @entity48 counterpart , about the @entity1 negotiations , @entity48 's @entity105 said			1
he had been scheduled to leave @entity15 on friday night but delayed his exit until at least saturday " in order to continue consultations " with @entity21 , @entity114 and others , @entity111 spokeswoman @entity110 said			0
the same day , @entity24 president @entity116 made an announcement that seems to signal that , at the least , @entity118 has n't given up hope on a deal by announcing a " pause ( to ) efforts to further further reduce @entity1 's crude oil sales during the " ongoing talks			1
" in return for this and other limited relief measures , @entity1 has taken steps that have halted -- and in key respects rolled back -- progress on its nuclear program , " the @entity125 said in a statement			1
" @entity134 has verified that @entity1 is meeting these commitments			0
" as to the talks , @entity14 in a statement described them as " positive discussions " conducted in " a very cordial atmosphere			0
" " it is clear that both sides want to try to get a deal done but none of us want a bad deal , and we are very clear that we have to get more flexibility from the @entity1 , " he said			1
" in return , we are prepared to show some flexibility on our side			0
" @entity152 , the head of @entity1 's parliament , sounded an optimistic note in remarks reported by @entity156			2
he said that when you look at the talks as a whole , there are grounds for a deal			0
" as far as i 'm informed , the two sides have had serious talks , " he said .			0

@entity24 wo n't push to reduce @entity1 's oil sales ; thinks @entity1 has halted nuclear progress
