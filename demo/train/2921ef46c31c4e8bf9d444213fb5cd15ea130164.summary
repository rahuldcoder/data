-- @entity1 has given up its quest to conquer the market for telecom network equipment in the @entity5 , where the @entity8 company 's sales efforts have been repeatedly blocked by security fears			1
" we are not interested in the @entity5 market any more , " @entity10 , executive vice-president , said at the company 's annual analyst summit on tuesday			2
the world 's second - largest supplier of network gear by revenue has shifted the focus of expansion away from the @entity5 over the past year			1
@entity1 's decision ends an aggressive push for business in the world 's largest economy			1
@entity5 security officials and politicians have repeatedly identified @entity1 as a threat to @entity5 national security -- an allegation the @entity8 company has consistently denied			1
although @entity1 has done business with 45 of the world 's top carriers , it failed to get contracts from any leading operators in the @entity5			1
last month , @entity39 , the third largest @entity5 mobile network operator , and its @entity42 suitor , @entity43 , both gave assurances to the @entity46 intelligence committee that they would not use @entity1 equipment			1
in october , a @entity5 congressional report officially branded @entity1 and @entity49 , its smaller @entity8 peer , a threat to national security			1
at the time , representative @entity52 , chairman of the @entity53 , called on the @entity5 government and private sector companies to shun @entity1 and @entity49			2
despite its success in other markets , including the @entity58 , @entity1 has struggled in the @entity5 for years because of concerns among politicians and security officials about the military background of its founder @entity63 , a former @entity64 officer			1
in 2008 , @entity1 retracted a bid for @entity66 , a @entity5 technology company , after it emerged that the proposed deal would not gain regulatory approval in @entity69			2
two years later , @entity1 bid for a multibillion - dollar contract to supply network infrastructure to @entity39 , one of the top @entity5 operators , but lost after the @entity5 government intervened			1
it also failed to win bids for other @entity5 telecom assets and , in 2011 , was forced to unwind a $ 2m deal to buy patents from a @entity5 company			0
in response to these setbacks , @entity1 launched a major @entity5 lobbying campaign			2
it hired a number of senior executives from ailing rivals such as @entity87 and @entity88 , in an effort to build a big research and development presence			0
@entity91 , a senior @entity1 executive , also wrote a passionate open letter calling on the @entity5 government to launch a formal investigation , which he believed would clear his company			0
but october 's congressional report made it even more difficult for the company to do business in the @entity5 , @entity1 executives say			2
as a result , it has halted its expansion there			0
while @entity1 still employs 1,400 people in the @entity5 , its r&d headcount has dropped from 800 to 500 , and the sales team has shrunk too			0
executives at the company 's consumer and enterprise business - groups said they no longer consider the @entity5 to be a strategic market			0
@entity1 on tuesday also revised downwards the long - term outlook for its enterprise business , its youngest but fastest - growing division			0
@entity112 , the unit 's chief executive , said its goal of generating $ 15bn in revenues from the business by 2017 -- a target set just last year -- was " too optimistic "			0
the company is now aiming for just us $ 10bn			0
but mr @entity10 still expects the unit 's revenues to grow 45 per cent this year , up from 25 per cent growth in 2012 .			0
