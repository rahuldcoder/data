-- what 's in the coffee in @entity3 ? apparently something that 's making a few folks pretty generous			1
at least six times this week , customers at @entity9 restaurants have paid for their own cups of coffee and cups of brew for the next 500 or more people in line , according to media reports			1
the first 500 free javas were gifts of an anonymous donor at a @entity9 in downtown @entity21 , @entity22 , on monday , @entity17 reported			1
a man in his 20s bought a double - double and a doughnut and told the clerk to put the next 500 large coffees on his debit card , according to the report			0
" ( the staff was ) thinking maybe he was so blessed that he wanted to share his blessing , or maybe he won the lotto or something , " store manager @entity31 told @entity17			0
