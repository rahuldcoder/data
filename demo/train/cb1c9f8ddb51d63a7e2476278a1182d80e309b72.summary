editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			1
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- based on the sheer volume of bodies , @entity19 should not work			2
as the world 's largest pilgrimage and one of the @entity26 , each year about 3 million people cram themselves into the relatively small holy city of @entity28 , @entity29 , to offer up this , the holiest of @entity32 rites			1
in late 2008 , i accompanied my parents on @entity19 and managed to sneak a @entity9 video camera past state security and capture the trip as we saw it			1
the scene was insane , beyond what i could have ever imagined			1
over a four - day period , @entity28 's population is more than doubled , with legions of devout @entity43 making their way shoulder to shoulder through the dozen rituals that comprise @entity19			2
if it were n't for the solemn and religious underpinnings , it would be an unnerving assembly of human beings for such a concentrated space -- like what @entity52 might have been , but less annoying and without the hippies , drugs , and @entity56			0
many @entity19 rites have been dramatized in movies and elsewhere , but it is essentially a highly choreographed succession of religious tasks : circling the @entity62 at the center of @entity64 ( the @entity64 ) , @entity65 ( pacing between two holy sites ) , the famous @entity67 , loads of deep prayer and meditation			0
the point is to purge believers of sins and free them for the next chapter in their lives			0
it is required that each muslim of means make the trip at least once			0
see part two of @entity81 at @entity9 given the number of pilgrims and the extremely short span of time @entity19 covers , it is virtually impossible to make the journey without the help of a tour group			2
there are dozens of agencies available to help usher visitors through the masses and ensure that all the requisite rituals are met			0
but even with their guidance , completing all the tasks , navigating the various holy sites , and sticking to the hurried itinerary is extremely challenging			0
compound the situation with several million people of every economic class and comfort from 100 - plus countries across the globe -- many lined up asleep on the side of the road , praying on hilltops , and making their way to and from holy sites -- and it 's no surprise that some pilgrims ca n't complete all the rituals			1
but despite this monumental challenge , the bottom line was that doing the @entity19 was amazing			0
it took us to another plane of existence , it forced a detachment from our lives , and it was unlike anything i 've ever experienced .			0

three million people take part in the world 's largest annual pilgrimage in @entity29
vice founder @entity132 went with his family in 2008 and shot *footage*
@entity132 : experience was " beyond what i could have ever imagined "
