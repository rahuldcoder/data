the investigation into @entity2 is now classified as a criminal investigation , @entity0 reported , citing the @entity5 police chief			1
inspector general of police @entity6 said authorities have already recorded more than 170 statements and will interview more people for the @entity2 probe , the @entity0 said			1
but @entity6 cautioned that what happened with flight 370 might still be unknown after the investigation			0
he added that the investigation into the flight simulator in the pilot 's house is still inconclusive			0
authorities are awaiting an expert 's report on the simulator , he said			2
after three and a half weeks , the search for the missing plane has come down to this : a lot of floating rubbish , hundreds of heartbroken relatives and , now , quibbling over words all acknowledge offer no clues into what happened to the doomed plane			2
@entity5 authorities on tuesday released the transcript of radio chatter between air traffic controllers and the plane in the hour or so before it vanished while flying from @entity37 , @entity5 , to @entity38 on march 8 with 239 people on board			1
the transcript shows the last voice transmission from the doomed plane was " good night @entity5 three - seven - zero " -- not the " all right , good night " transmission authorities had previously used			1
the comments are " exactly what you 'd expect " in a cockpit , airline safety expert @entity44 told @entity51 's " the lead			0
" still , even if this new transcript offers no clues about the plane 's mysterious disappearance , the discrepancy has provided fresh fodder for critics of @entity5 's handling of the investigation			1
read the cockpit transcript that authorities gave one version and let it stand uncorrected for weeks undermines confidence in the investigation , air accident investigation experts told @entity51			2
" high criticism is in order at this point , " said @entity67 , a @entity51 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity70 @entity69			0
and @entity74 , a former chief of staff at the @entity75 , added that people following the investigation " have n't had a straight , clear word that we can have a lot of fidelity in			2
" " we have the tragedy of the crash , we have the tragedy of an investigation gone awry and then we have questions about where we go from here , " he said			0
@entity5 officials have defended their work , with acting transport minister @entity91 recently saying , " @entity92 will judge us well			1
" regardless of one 's assessment of @entity5 's response , that does n't change the immense challenge it faces -- especially given the few apparent details on altitude , speed and , of course , location			1
" they are looking in a vast area in very deep waters , ... and we really have no idea where it went in , " @entity104 , an @entity105 scientist who helped create flight data recorders that could be key in determining what happened , told @entity51			2
" ... a needle in a haystack would be much easier to find			0
" inside the flight simulator search ' could drag on ' after refocusing their search friday to a new patch of @entity120 hundreds of miles from where they had been looking , authorities still have n't found anything definitively linked to flight 370			1
ten aircraft and nine ships crisscrossed a 46,000 - square - mile ( 120,000 - square - kilometer ) search zone on tuesday			2
with so many planes in the skies over the search zone , @entity105 sent an airborne air traffic control plane to guard against accidents			2
the search zone for wednesday shifted eastward toward the @entity105 coast from what it had the day before , according to the @entity137			1
while this means new territory will be covered , officials caution against expecting an imminent breakthrough			0
" it will take time , " retired air chief marshal @entity142 , the head of the @entity105 's new @entity143 , said tuesday			0
" it 's not something that 's necessarily going to be resolved in the next two weeks			0
" the plane disappeared over the waters between @entity5 and @entity150 , after signing off with @entity5 controllers , but before checking in with their counterparts in @entity150			1
authorities do n't know what happened on board after that , but radar and satellite data show the plane turned off course and flew back across @entity5 before turning south over the @entity120			1
based on sophisticated analysis of satellite data , investigators believe it went down in the southern @entity120 , but they ca n't pinpoint a location			0
a @entity5 government source told @entity51 on monday that the airliner 's turn off course is being considered a " criminal act , " either by one of the pilots or someone else			1
in a background briefing given to @entity51 , @entity5 investigators said they believed the plane was " flown by someone with good flying knowledge of the aircraft			1
" a senior @entity5 government official last week told @entity51 law enforcement analyst @entity181 that authorities have found nothing in days of investigating the two pilots that leads them to any motive , be it political , suicidal or extremist			1
" it 's one of the great mysteries of our time , " @entity105 prime minister @entity190 said in a radio interview wednesday from @entity192 , where he 'll host his @entity5 counterpart @entity193 later in the day			1
" ... we owe it to the world , we owe it to those families to do whatever we reasonably can do get to the bottom of this			0
" more help on the way @entity209 relatives of passengers got a chance wednesday to learn how the search is unfolding and how it 's been concluded that the flight ended in the @entity120			1
@entity215 and @entity5 's @entity216 led a closed - door briefing with the @entity209 kin in @entity37 , the @entity5 government said			1
technical experts from @entity5 , @entity209 and @entity105 were also expected to participate , as was the @entity209 ambassador to @entity5			1
meanwhile , even more assets are contributing to the search			2
@entity91 tweeted the @entity223 , a @entity225 nuclear submarine , will take part			0
it 'll be joined by an @entity105 ship with a pinger locator designed to listen for locator beacons attached to the plane 's flight data recorder plus a submersible capable of canvassing the ocean floor for wreckage			0
both pieces of technology come from the @entity238			0
the equipment wo n't be of any use , however , until searchers are able to find wreckage from the plane to help narrow the search zone			2
that 's because neither the pinger locator nor the submersible can quickly scan the enormous area being searched			2
under the best of sea conditions , the pingers can be heard 2 nautical miles away			0
but high seas , background noise , wreckage or silt can all make pingers harder to detect			0
it will take the ship , the @entity258 , two more days just to get to the search zone , leaving precious little time to locate the flight data recorders before the batteries on its locator beacon run out			0
time is running out : the batteries are designed to last 30 days			0
wednesday is the 26th day that authorities have been looking for the plane			1
there 's no guarantee it will be found anytime soon			0
for all the expertise and technology , there 's still more unknown about flight 370 than is known about it -- including its altitude , precise speed and , especially , its final resting place			0
as @entity51 aviation analyst @entity279 said : " we 're seeing what amounts to a big guess			0
" families of newlyweds still waiting @entity258 : a mission of hope in search for @entity2 mystery of @entity2 surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy			1

@entity0 : police have recorded 170 statements and will interview more people
search area for new day shifts eastward
@entity5 authorities revise language used in last radio *communications*
wednesday is the 26th day authorities have been searching for @entity2
