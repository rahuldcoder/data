@entity0 , @entity1 -- for more than 20 years , the bulletproof museum case housed a small piece of yesteryear : a gold bar recovered from a sunken @entity8 galleon			1
today , its case is broken , littered with black fingerprint dust			0
two thieves were caught in the act by the museum 's security cameras			1
" this is a special piece , " said @entity17 , executive director of the @entity18 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" all the pieces have an incredible historic value , but this is the piece that was shared with the public in a whole totally different way			0
" it was different because visitors could touch it			0
by reaching into the specially designed display case , more than 6 million people have touched the 74.85 - ounce bar , valued at more than $ 550,000			1
" they 're touching something that belonged to someone in 1622 , " said @entity31 , author of " @entity32			0
" " ordinarily people do n't get to touch something like that			2
you ca n't touch an @entity40 mummy			1
this is a hands - on connection to history			0
" but now , what does a thief do with a priceless , high - profile artifact ? is there an underground market that will pay $ 550,000 for this almost 400 - year - old piece of solid gold ? one expert says no. " that 's why these crimes do n't make a whole lot of money for the criminals , " said @entity52 , a former @entity53 agent who once headed the @entity53 's @entity54			1
" it does n't make sense to do it			2
" wandering through the museum , the thieves can be seen in security video trying to open museum doors			1
the video is incredibly clear			2
first , they appeared to be targeting a display case of gold chains			2
then , after a security guard left this part of the museum , a man can be seen reaching into the case housing the gold bar and placing the little piece of history into his pocket before exiting the museum			1
" we 're getting information and following leads , " said @entity0 police chief @entity80			1
" unfortunately we have n't got the best lead , which is , i know that person and we go out , and it 's a positive @entity87 , and we 're able to go out and pick those guys up			2
" what makes the crime so shocking , police said , is that the thieves were able to snap the glass at its edges			1
it 's not just any glass , but three - eighths - inch thick bulletproof @entity98 glass			0
" by designating this as a handling object , it brought certain risks to the bar , " @entity99 said			2
" but after your first five , and your next 10 , and when you get to 25 years , you start to get to the point when you think that it 's never going to happen			0
" treasure hunter and salvor @entity108 recovered the solid gold bar from the wreck of the @entity112 in 1980			1
@entity108 and his team had been searching for the @entity114 and instead found the sister ship , the @entity112			0
both ships had gone down in a hurricane off @entity0 shortly after leaving @entity118 , @entity119 , in 1622			1
the ships were headed home to @entity8 with a cargo of gold , silver and coins from the new world			2
the team found the @entity114 in 1985			0
the stolen bar is one of dozens of gold and silver bars retrieved from the bottom of the sea			1
experts say that about 90 percent of stolen art and artifacts is eventually recovered that but it often takes years to find			1
the @entity53 has recovered more than 2,600 items of cultural property valued at more than $ 142 million			2
the items range from @entity143 artifacts to @entity145 paintings			0
@entity52 , the former @entity53 agent and author of " priceless : how i went undercover to rescue the @entity153 's @entity152 , " said the market is incredibly small for these high - profile objects			0
he said thieves often steal the items and then try to figure how to sell them			1
" we recovered paintings and artifacts that were missing for many years			0
ten , 15 , sometimes 20 years , because the thieves could n't get rid of them , " he said			1
" they kept them in their closets			0
they made no money out of the deals			0
" in 1990 , thieves entered the @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171 , and stole 13 works of art , including three @entity174 from the 1600s			0
none has been recovered , and federal agents are using @entity178 to try to find the perpetrators			0
@entity52 said no legitimate collector would take the risks associated with buying stolen goods			2
" they do n't buy stolen property , because ... they ca n't show it , they ca n't enjoy it			1
... it makes them into criminals , and the last thing they want to do is spend a lot of money for a painting or for an artifact , whether it 's gold or whatever , and have it seized by the police and go to jail , " he said			0
@entity0 authorities said they believe the thieves were not locals and that they are probably long gone			1
the museum 's insurance company is offering a $ 25,000 reward for information leading to the return of the bar			1
police said they remain hopeful they will solve the crime but just hope they can recover this golden piece of history			0
" this is going to end up in somebody 's house probably , used as a paperweight , " said @entity80 , who is leading the investigation			0
" other than melting it down , which is the worst - case scenario for everyone , we 're just hoping that they will come to their senses somehow and return this back to the museum			0

gold bar stolen from @entity0 , @entity1 , museum is worth more than $ 550,000
video shows crime taking place , but leads are sparse
thieves often ca n't sell stolen treasures because legitimate collectors wo n't bite
but stolen treasures are often hard to find
