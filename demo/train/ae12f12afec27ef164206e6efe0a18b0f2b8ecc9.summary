-- in a country obsessed with its premier sport , @entity2 's football season kicks off saturday to heavy anticipation -- but without any fans in the stands			1
instead of the roars of raucous crowds , players take the pitch to the relative silence of secure military stadiums			0
saturday 's matches are the first since a gruesome riot at a football match last year that left 74 dead and 1,000 injured			1
dubbed the " massacre at @entity19 , " the riot in february 2012 broke out after @entity19 - based @entity20 defeated @entity22 's @entity21 , 3 - 1			1
fans from both sides bashed one another with rocks and chairs , and many of those who died fell from the bleachers while others suffocated			0
while the football rivalries between the cities have been a mainstay , recent political upheaval has only fueled the fire			0
last week , a judge issued death sentences for 21 @entity19 residents for their roles in the riot			1
those verdicts incensed @entity19 residents who blame security officials -- not fans -- for the mass tragedy			1
fear and loathing in @entity2 : the fallout from @entity19 decades of strife the history of tense relations between @entity19 and @entity22 date about 60 years , as residents of @entity19 have felt betrayed by @entity2 security forces during a series of wars with @entity55			1
thousands of residents were displaced several times because of the @entity58 , the @entity59 of 1967 , the @entity60 with @entity55 , and the @entity61			0
residents of @entity19 , in the northeastern corner of the country , believed security forces did not adequately defend their city			2
in addition , some say @entity22 has not invested enough in @entity19 's infrastructure , and that their city does n't reap enough tax benefits from trade with international ships that pass though @entity19 via the critical @entity71			1
some also contend that @entity19 is still getting the cold shoulder from @entity22 after a 1999 assassination attempt of then - president @entity74 , who was visiting the city			1
could @entity2 fall apart ? molotov cocktails and fire at the presidential palace the new football season also kicks off amid new turmoil embroiling the country			2
the latest spate of violence started during demonstrations last week to mark the two - year anniversary of the @entity2 revolution			0
protesters angry with the slow pace of change and with president @entity91 's actions clashed with @entity91 supporters and police in the cities such as @entity95 and @entity96			2
those clashes , combined with furor over @entity19 death sentences , led to scores of deaths			2
the chaos snowballed through friday , when a fire broke out at the entrance of the presidential palace as protesters hurled @entity107 cocktails and rocks at security forces			0
authorities responded with tear gas and water cannon , and @entity2 tv aired live footage of security forces beating a naked man on the ground			0
a presidential spokesman on saturday deplored the video of the man being beaten , calling it " shocking			1
" the government assures " that what happened was an individual behaviot and does not represent the ideology of the police force , " spokesman @entity119 said			2
he promised an investigation into the incident			0
the protests are the latest in the seesaw struggle between @entity2 's first democratically elected president and dissidents who say his leadership is a throwback to past dictatorships , particularly the reign of @entity74 , who was toppled two years ago in the popular revolt			0
protesters attack presidential palace in @entity22 more than just a game in @entity2 , football is n't just a sport			1
it 's an escape from the economic , political and social tumult wracking the country			0
the only times traffic virtually disappears from @entity22 streets are when residents break their daily fasts during @entity149 and when the city 's two main teams -- @entity21 and @entity152 -- take the field			2
saturday 's matches feature both those @entity22 teams -- @entity156 against @entity157 and @entity152 against @entity158			1
but while football has both unified and polarized parts of the country , fans now must cheer or lament from afar			0
@entity0 's @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
