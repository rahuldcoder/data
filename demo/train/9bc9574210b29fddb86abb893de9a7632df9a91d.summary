-- for me , predicting the future is a family business			2
my grandmother was a professional clairvoyant ( called , unimaginatively , madam clair ) and used to offer palm readings and crystal ball gazing in her living room			2
growing up around tarot cards and horoscopes has left me a bit cynical about making firm predictions , if only because they always seemed to be " you will meet a tall , dark stranger			2
" but it 's not impossible to make some intelligent guesses about the political world in the coming months based on the information we already have			1
here are five of them			2
the 2016 presidential election will start very early			1
in fact , it sort of began before the last election even ended , when vice president @entity27 told reporters that he did n't think 2012 was the last race he would run			1
in recent weeks , sen. @entity30 , @entity31 , and rep. @entity32 , @entity33 , have laid out some philosophical visions , and @entity36 gov. @entity35 has tried to brand himself as the @entity38 's mr. @entity37			0
we can expect some casual visits to @entity41 or @entity42 by outgoing secretary of state @entity43 or @entity46 gov. @entity45 , but an outsider candidate worth watching will be gov. @entity48 of @entity49			0
he has yet to establish himself on the national stage , but he has a strong reputation among grassroots liberals			0
what @entity53 want in 2013 2			2
guns will become a big legislative issue			2
we 're not going to see the kind of action that @entity59 wants , but the tragedy at @entity61 has certainly started a debate that should be continued by the new @entity63			0
@entity65 sen. @entity64 , a @entity66 , has promised to introduce legislation on @entity68 that will be similar to the federal assault weapons ban , which passed in 1994 and expired in 2004 , and she has likely support from the @entity71 and conservative democrats like sen. @entity73 of @entity74			0
but we 'll see tough opposition from @entity38			0
no , the tea party wo n't go away			1
it 's true that the anti-government movement has had a very bad year in 2012 and that it has been somewhat sidelined by @entity71 speaker @entity79 , but that does n't spell the end			0
first , the tea party has planted some strong roots in online activism and fund - raising : the big conservative event of 2013 will be @entity87 , and only the tea party has the resources to dominate it			1
second , @entity79 might find his leadership challenged on january 3 and be forced to accept the movement 's continued influence within the @entity38			0
third , the issue agenda remains favorable to the tea party			1
tax cuts , balanced budgets and gun control are exactly the kind of mobilizers that are likely to revive the right			1
the tea party disappeared from view in 2012 only because it was eclipsed by the drive to elect @entity105			1
now that the debate has moved back from the party / personal to the substantive / legislative , the tea party will capitalize			1
a big year for issues in the courts 4			1
gay marriage will return as a big talking point in the summer			1
in june , the @entity114 will likely make a decision on the fate of @entity65 's @entity117 and the federal @entity118			0
my instinct is that the justices will make decisions that satisfy no one , perhaps ruling against @entity118 but accepting proposition 8			0
certainly it feels unlikely that they 'd want to give a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of gay marriage , which would mean pushing the law in a direction that very few state governments seem willing to go			1
either way , president @entity134 's victory in 2012 did n't end the culture war ; it just evened the odds a little			0
from the perspective of a @entity139 , @entity53 remains a remarkably socially conservative country that has yet to be sold on marriage equality			2
opinion : @entity53 on the cusp of social change 5			0
we will come to miss @entity146			1
one of the real joys of the 2012 race was covering the campaign of " @entity150 , " a man with a chin for every insult he delivered			0
he jumped to the front of the nomination pack in early 2012 partly because @entity38 conservatives had few other options ( one @entity160 operative described him to me as " an imperfect vehicle " ) but also because of the sheer strength of his personality			2
and while the rest of the party limited itself to discussing petty matters such as health care or the federal budget , @entity146 's plans ranged from getting school kids to work as janitors to building mines on the moon			1
he seemed genuinely surprised that the cash - strapped voters did n't buy his idea of conquering the galaxy , but a prophet in his own land is always without honor			0
in a hundred years time , when the @entity53 colonists of @entity183 are still debating gun control , do n't be surprised if @entity146 is n't revisited as a man before his time			1
perhaps he 'll make the back of the $ 10,000 bill			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity193 : there are a few *reasonable* political predictions that can be made for 2013
for one thing , he says , the 2016 election will start early ; @entity27 already dropping hints
he says gun control and gay marriage will be big issues in coming months
he says the tea party will rise again , and we will all realize we miss @entity146
