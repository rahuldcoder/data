-- " shh ... shh get back , " the man with the walkie - talkie said			2
" @entity4 , one of @entity6 's @entity5 , draws visitors with beautiful beaches and excellent snorkeling			1
we had stumbled onto the set of a " survivor " - like television show			2
but i 'm getting ahead of myself			0
first let me tell you how we stumbled onto the @entity5 in @entity6 , and then i 'll tell you how we came upon the @entity15 on the island of @entity17			1
every year , my husband and i take my niece on a summer vacation			0
this year , we decided to go to @entity6			1
besides the canal , @entity6 has a lot to offer : there are mountains , beaches , colonial cities and rain forests			1
after we found a $ 158 round trip flight from @entity30 , @entity31 , the decision was made			2
my only fear was the weather ; it was rainy season in @entity36			0
after weeks of research , i was torn			0
we had enough time to visit one set of islands , and there were two island chains that i was having a hard time choosing between			2
the @entity44 are off the northeast coast of @entity6 in the @entity46			1
they 're also known as @entity48 and are home to the @entity50			0
it would be a chance to see the @entity53 up close , living as they have for centuries in grass huts along the water 's edge			2
the other option was the @entity5			1
the @entity5 , less well - known than the @entity44 , is off the southern @entity60 coast of @entity6			1
after an agonizing week of self - debate , i decided that our summer vacation would include a trip to the @entity5			1
the flight was only 20 minutes from @entity67 , but more importantly , i was told it did n't rain as much on the @entity60 side			1
the sales pitch to my niece : " we are going to where the 2003 edition of ' @entity71 ' and ' survivor : @entity74 ' were filmed			1
" i was referring to the popular @entity76 reality tv show , and i did n't realize that dozens of other countries had their own versions			0
i admit my destination choice was not as educational as a few days with the @entity50 , but i thought it would be better than being rained in with a bored teenager			0
after a short flight from @entity67 in a puddle jumper , we were on the island of @entity4 , one of hundreds that make up the @entity5 and one of three that can be reached by commercial flight			1
it 's a tiny island with a handful of places to stay and even fewer places to get a meal			1
golf carts , the primary mode of transportation , can be rented upon arrival			0
all of @entity4 's entertainment is provided by the sea			1
it 's a beach bum 's paradise			2
if you are a beach bum and a reality tv fan , you can sit on the sand and watch props being built for the contestants ' challenges			0
it 's probably the best set shop in the world , or at least the one with the nicest view			2
but the @entity5 offer more than just an exotic tv set			1
for $ 30 an hour , you can go snorkeling and island hopping in a small but comfortable wooden fishing boat			2
we found @entity116 , our boat captain and guide , on @entity118 , the beach in front of the @entity120			0
we did some of the best snorkeling i 've ever done anywhere in the world			0
after a morning of fantastic snorkeling , i asked @entity116 where " @entity71 " was filmed			1
i will take you there , " he said			0
@entity116 took us to @entity131 , one of many uninhabited islands just off the shore of @entity4			1
as the island 's white sandy beaches came into sight , we noticed a clearing where people were putting finishing touches on what looked like a game for contestants			1
our boat captain told us it was for " @entity145 " ( " challenge " ) , a @entity148 version of the popular reality show			0
the word on @entity4 was that a few countries ( @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 , to name a few ) were either finishing filming " @entity71 " - type shows or starting new seasons			1
a representative for the @entity158 told me the government had limited information on the filming and could not confirm the word on the street			0
we jumped out of the boat , waded through the clear , warm blue water and onto @entity17 , unacknowledged as work continued on the wooden set			0
noticing a well - worn path , we decided to check out the rest of the island			1
we thought we were alone when we reached the beach on the other side			0
but as we walked down what we thought was a deserted beach , we spotted an orange flag in the sand			0
we knew the @entity76 " survivor " was filmed on this island , but we did not expect to be standing in front of contestants in orange buffs , sitting on a log in the shade			1
this is when the man with the walkie - talkie shushed us because they were filming			2
the locals talk about the shows and the many countries they hail from , but they do n't seem to capitalize on the " @entity71 " fame			1
@entity4 locals certainly make money off the film staff , medics and contestants , but evidently they have n't printed the t - shirts yet			1
the only shirts we saw were on the backs of others that identified them as " @entity202			0
" perhaps a true fan could purchase a shirt directly off someone 's back			2
the island is only so big , and you are bound to run into a crew from some country			0
one night , we were the only non-reality show customers in @entity212 's restaurant , a popular place for beer and pizza			0
after our innocent but failed attempt at a guest appearance on " @entity145 , " we returned to the basic comforts on @entity4			2
that night , as we relaxed in a restaurant -- cold drinks in hand , a warm hearty meal just ordered -- darkness fell			0
the rain , as it often does in the tropics , started coming down in sheets			0
i leaned back and thought to myself , " if i was a contestant , tonight i would vote myself off of @entity131			0

" @entity71 " and similar shows have been filmed on @entity6 's @entity5
the island of @entity4 is a 20 - minute flight from @entity67
beaches and marine *exploration* are the main *sources* of entertainment
