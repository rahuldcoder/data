@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 commandos who died when their helicopter crashed in eastern @entity1 were targeting a @entity7 commander directly responsible for attacks on @entity4 troops , military officials with knowledge of the operation said sunday			1
the crash killed 30 @entity4 service members , the @entity1 war 's worst single - day @entity4 toll			1
among the dead were 22 @entity16 who were being flown in to assist an @entity18 unit pinned down by enemy fire in restive @entity20 early saturday morning			1
the current whereabouts of the @entity7 leader targeted in the raid were unclear , said the military officials , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of ongoing operations in the crash area			1
one civilian translator and seven @entity1 commandos were also killed in the crash , officials said			1
@entity33 troops were still combing through the wreckage of the downed helicopter on sunday , said lt. col. @entity36 , a spokesman for the @entity37 in @entity1			1
" they 're just trying to recover everything from the crash at this point , " @entity36 said			2
elsewhere , four other @entity33 soldiers were killed in separate insurgent attacks on sunday			1
two were killed in the country 's volatile east , while another two service members died in southern @entity1 , @entity33 reported			1
their deaths add to a heavy blow against @entity4 military operations in the region just as @entity33 troops are drawing down and a handover to @entity1 security forces is under way			1
the majority of the @entity16 -- considered to be among @entity4 's most elite warriors -- belonged to the same covert unit that conducted the may raid that killed @entity59 , though they were not the same men , a @entity4 military official said			1
the @entity7 has taken responsibility for the attack , claiming to have downed the helicopter with a rocket - propelled grenade			1
provincial council head @entity66 also said insurgents used a rocket - propelled grenade in the attack , though the actual type of weapon is still unclear			2
while military officials in @entity1 have not confirmed that an attack brought down the helicopter , they have acknowledged it was operating in an area rife with insurgent activity			1
@entity1 officials say the craft crashed in @entity20 's @entity80 , a corridor located roughly 60 miles southwest of the @entity1 capital and situated amid mountainous and rocky terrain			2
@entity80 village elders reported that insurgents shot at the craft when it was returning from an operation that left eight insurgents dead , according to @entity66			2
@entity33 declined to comment on the details of the operation or the circumstances of the crash			1
the specifics of the incident were first made public by way of a written statement from @entity1 president @entity97			2
" it was amazing to me that the first details came from the presidential palace , " said @entity98 , a parliament member from @entity0			2
" at the same time , we did n't hear anything from @entity33			1
" @entity98 said @entity97 's swift release of the crash details amounted to helping the @entity7 quickly claim responsibility for the incident			1
the @entity1 president has come under increasing criticism by @entity111 lawmakers over his willingness to negotiate with insurgent leadership			1
he has traditionally said he is trying to bring an end to the near decadelong conflict			2
a presidential spokesman dismissed @entity98 's allegations as " nonsense , " saying @entity97 's initial statement on the crash was meant to express condolences over the loss of @entity4 life			0
meanwhile , @entity97 called a security meeting of his top advisers sunday to discuss the incident , according to a statement from his office			1
he spoke to @entity4 president @entity129 , who " noted the extraordinary service of the @entity4 who gave their lives , and expressed his condolences for the @entity1 who died serving by their side , " according to the @entity135			2

because i know where i am going if something happens to me , ' " @entity153 recounted			0
" he is with the @entity169 now , " she added			0
" i will see him again someday			0
" saturday 's fatalities came as about 10,000 @entity4 troops are scheduled to depart by year 's end , with the full drawdown expected to take place by the end of 2014			0
@entity176 , the newly minted @entity4 ambassador in @entity0 , has pledged that no permanent @entity4 bases would remain inside the war - torn country -- but he also has suggested that @entity4 military commitments to @entity1 could extend beyond the draw - down date			0
saturday 's incident has also raised concerns among @entity0 lawmakers over the perceived strength of the insurgency			0
" this shows the @entity7 are now more mobilized than before , " said @entity187 , a parliament member from @entity189 province , the traditional heartland of the @entity7			1
" now there is an organized play in @entity1 that seems ( to suggest ) that @entity4 forces will soon leave			0
" meanwhile , officials are being especially tight - lipped because recovery operations -- which began immediately following the crash -- are still under way and body identifications and family notifications are just beginning , a @entity4 military official said			0
the @entity4 @entity202 in @entity0 said @entity37 " is still assessing the circumstances that resulted in these deaths			0
" @entity206 spokesman @entity205 said it 's too early to say if the @entity7 caused the crash			1

" information is still coming in about this incident			0
i think it 's important that we allow investigators to do their work before jumping to too many conclusions , " said adm. @entity212 , chairman of the @entity213			0
" it 's also important that we respect the process of notifying family members , no matter how long that takes			2
" there are 150,000 @entity37 troops in @entity1 , including just under 100,000 from the @entity4 -- the largest @entity33 presence in the region since the @entity4 - led war began in 2001			1
