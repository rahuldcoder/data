-- what most of us take for granted , assuming you are reading this page , has become an obsession for our next member of @entity7 , who is from the @entity8 at 26 , @entity9 has already proven herself a caring and accomplished individual			1
graduation from @entity14 , for most over-achievers , marks the launch of a stellar career in business , politics , law or medicine			0
but @entity9 has put her pursuit of a medical degree at @entity23 on hold as she works to better the lives of others			1
it 's really quite simple			0
@entity9 believes everyone should be able to see , regardless of their ability to pay for something as basic as sunglasses , eyeglasses , or even sight - restoring surgery			2
" it 's so satisfying and so gratifying to be able to hear the patients and their stories when they have their sight restored , " @entity9 said			2
this compassion followed her to @entity14 , where as a sophomore she founded what is now an international non-profit organization -- @entity44			1
@entity9 and her army of volunteers ( more than 4,000 at last count ) , have provided vision screening and education to some 500,000 people , free of charge			2
more than 9,500 people who lost their sight to cataracts and other eye disease have had their vision restored through surgeries provided by @entity44 volunteers			0

@entity9 will travel to @entity73 and @entity74 in the coming months , as well as writing a blog about her work at home			1
with all this dedication to others , i asked her if she ever feels like she missed out on being a kid , or an irresponsible college student , to which she replied , " nothing is more gratifying than being able to run the organization 's programs and help so many people throughout the world			0
" that 's vintage @entity9 -- her work is truly inspiring			1
