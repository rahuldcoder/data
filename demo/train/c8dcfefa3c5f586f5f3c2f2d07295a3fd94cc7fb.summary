hard questions are being raised about the @entity1 in @entity2 now that the @entity3 will formally meet with the erstwhile @entity5 ally			1
why is the @entity3 government engaging the hard - line islamic fundamentalist group , a regime that once sheltered @entity9 and his terrorist network and was eventually routed out of @entity2 by a @entity3 invasion after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks ? such tough questions were unleashed shortly after the announcement about upcoming @entity3 - @entity1 talks during a tuesday news conference held by @entity18 spokeswoman @entity17			1
she was asked point - blank : " in the eyes of the @entity3 , is @entity1 a terrorist group ? " responded @entity17 : " well , i 'm not sure how they 're defined at this particular moment			1
" to be fair , @entity17 described the @entity3 peace talks with the @entity1 -- which @entity2 president @entity24 opposes -- as the preliminary step toward long healing process in war - torn @entity2 and creating " reconciliation " within the country			1
at their office in @entity31 , @entity1 make changes in the meantime , many details remain to be worked out about the @entity1 , @entity17 said			1
on wednesday , @entity17 dismissed reports that the first meeting had been scheduled for thursday and said a date has n't been set			0
" the important thing here is that we 've long said that moving toward a reconciliation process , of which they are a key part -- the president has said this , the secretary ( of state ) has said this -- is an important part of moving towards a more stable @entity2			2
that 's why we support these efforts , " @entity17 said			0
" that 's why we 've been so engaged , why the secretary has been so engaged , at every level of the government			0
" what has influenced @entity3 leaders is the @entity1 's announcement that they oppose " the use of @entity2 soil to threaten other countries " such as the @entity3 and they support an @entity2 peace process , @entity17 said			1
to advance peace , the @entity1 has chosen , @entity31 , @entity64 , to open an office under the name " @entity67 of @entity2			1
" on tuesday , the @entity1 told reporters it wanted to improve its international relations			2
the @entity1 announcement has angered the @entity2 president , who said the country 's @entity73 wo n't take part in peace talks in @entity64 until the process is led by @entity2			1
in @entity78 , @entity24 met with politicians and members of the @entity73 on wednesday to talk about the @entity1 office in @entity64			2
why @entity1 would talk as @entity3 withdrawal looms in a statement , @entity24 said his country wants peace , " but the messages of continuation of fighting , which were sent out during the opening of the @entity1 office in @entity64 , are completely in contradiction with the peace - wanting spirit of the government of @entity2			1
" @entity24 was referring to how , during tuesday 's ribbon - cutting in @entity64 , a @entity1 spokesman said the group would continue its military campaign while at the same time renouncing international terrorism			2
seeming to make good on its military pledge , the @entity1 later tuesday claimed responsibility for the attack inside the @entity104 in @entity2 that killed four @entity3 soldiers			1
@entity24 criticized the @entity1 's promise about military advances			2
" this shows that the continuation of such policies of the @entity1 are for ... foreigners ' strategies and goals , " @entity24 's statement said			2
he charged that " foreign powers " are behind the opening of the @entity1 's office in @entity64			2
@entity3 officials , however , view the @entity1 office as a good start -- " good news , " in fact			1
" we 've long said that this conflict will likely not be won on the battlefield , and that is why we support this office , " @entity17 said			0
the ability to open a formal line of communication with the @entity1 is important to reaching an " end goal " of disassociating the @entity1 from @entity5 and bringing peace to @entity2 , @entity17 said			1
@entity17 asserted that the rights of women -- protected under the @entity2 constitution -- are not open for negotiation with the @entity1 , which has oppressed and mistreated women			0
" it 's not up for negotiation , " @entity17 said of the rights of @entity2 women and minorities			0
" that is the end goal of the process of reconciliation			0
this is a first step in the process			0
i 'm not overestimating or overstating what it means , but certainly , a first step is one farther step than we had just a few days ago			0
" what to know about the proposed talks @entity17 reiterated the " beginning of the process " theme -- even when asked whether the @entity3 government now considers the @entity1 " a legitimate fighting group " as opposed to " enemy combatants			1
" " our goal in @entity2 continues to be to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat @entity5 to ensure that the country can never again be a safe haven for terrorists			0
we 're doing both at the same time , talking and winding down our fighting in the country , " @entity17 said			0
but what about the several @entity1 leaders who are on a most - wanted list ? will the @entity3 delist them as the @entity1 has sought ? " this is just the first step in the process			1
there is a journey to go here , " @entity17 said			0
" so it 's significant because we are taking a step in the process , but there need to be negotiations , there need to be discussions			0
" @entity3 forces in @entity2 now stand at about 66,000 but are expected to fall to 32,000 by the end of the year , and there will be even fewer in 2014			0
gen. @entity178 , the former commander of @entity3 troops in @entity2 , recommended a level between 6,000 and 15,000 troops , but the @entity182 has cut the proposed figure further , to between 2,500 and 9,000 , according to a defense official			0
that @entity3 withdrawal raises the stakes for @entity2 to govern itself in peace .			2

peace talks between @entity3 and @entity1 are " a first step in the process " of reconciliation
but details remain to be worked out about the @entity1 *disavowing* @entity5
