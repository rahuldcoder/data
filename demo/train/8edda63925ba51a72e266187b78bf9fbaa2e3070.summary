@entity0 -- soldiers from outside @entity3 called to the @entity5 capital to boost troop numbers " were laughing " as they shot randomly at protesters in @entity8 on june 4 , 1989 , according to declassified @entity10 documents			1
the documents were among 25 @entity12 ( @entity12 ) records released to mark 25 years since @entity5 authorities sanctioned a brutal crackdown that killed hundreds , if not thousands , of pro-democracy protesters			1
each typed report is clearly marked as " not finally evaluated intelligence , " and some contain obvious inaccuracies including claims from the @entity10 source that supreme leader @entity26 had " died of heart failure			1
" the source even went as far as to quote a @entity5 official who reportedly said @entity26 's final words were : " originally , i did not want to use force			2
" in fact , @entity26 died almost 10 years later , in february 1997			0
still , the existence of a separate set of observations helps build a picture of the confusion and anger in @entity5 as authorities attempted to arrest and silence student protesters			1
soldiers shot ' at random ' according to one report , a source , whose name has been redacted , claimed members of the " @entity45 " shot " ' at random at any assembly of persons they encountered ' whether demonstrators or not			0
" another information report is said to contain details of an exchange between a @entity10 source and a female doctor who worked the night shift at @entity3 's @entity55 on june 4			1
the doctor said the hospital 's director stepped in to prevent the release of any more bodies after they discovered corpses were being cremated soon after being handed over to the @entity63 , the report said			0
hospital staff then started photographing the dead so they could later be identified			0
the doctor told the @entity10 source , 85 % of the hospital 's doctors had been trained in the @entity10 , and they were confident " friends in the @entity10 " would protect them from persecution by @entity5 authorities			1
in the same report , the @entity10 source said " the real heroes of the massacre were the flatcar pedicab operators who volunteered their services to transport the wounded and dead from @entity8 area to the hospital at the risk of losing heir own lives in the process			1
" ' very calm in @entity3 ' information filed back to the @entity10 also described the atmosphere in @entity3 in the months after the crackdown when the city was still under martial law			1
" on the surface , @entity3 appears very calm , " one report said			2
" shattered glass windows in buildings have all been replaced , but in the area of the foreign diplomats ' apartment houses , one can still see marks on the streets left by tanks			0
" standing guard at @entity8 were martial law forces , the report said			2
the " neatly dressed " troops " looked sharp " and stood at " rigid attention , " according to the report , which noted that it was the first time in recent years that the source had " seen such well disciplined @entity108 ( @entity108 ) soldiers			2
" however , outside @entity8 the report said other martial law troops were seen hanging around in groups of three or four " chatting or smoking , slovenly dressed , and appeared to lack discipline			1
" after the crackdown , @entity5 's leaders were said to be on alert for a possible terror attack			2
one report claimed leaders rarely left their homes and the license plates on their cars were changed " as an added security precaution			0
" the report noted that in the past observers could tell who was at a conference by checking the @entity129 cars parked outside			0
there was division , the report claimed , within " the top level of the party " as to whether the search should continue for students who had taken part in the protests			0
at that stage , the government had " more arrested students than they have prison space , " the report said			0
exit checks seemed to have been stepped up at @entity145 , the report claimed , and were " especially strict for any @entity5 who happened to look like a student or an intellectual			0
