an @entity1 judge this week gave a convicted rapist a sentence in which he could avoid jail time altogether , a move that shocked the victim and the defense			1
" i 'm still baffled , " the victim , @entity8 , told @entity9			1
she came forward publicly to express her outrage over wednesday 's sentencing			1
" i do n't know how any of this is possible			2
" the defense for @entity14 , 25 , was also caught off guard at first			1
" frankly , i think the judge 's sentence was surprising to most everyone in the courtroom , " said @entity14 's attorney , @entity16			1
@entity14 was convicted of one count of forcible rape and two counts of second - degree rape , attacks that occurred when @entity8 was a minor			1
@entity28 judge @entity27 handed down jail terms of 20 years for the forcible rape and 10 years each for the second - degree rape charges , to run concurrently , but he suspended those sentences			1
instead , he opted for three community corrections sentences of two years plus three years of supervised probation , to be carried out concurrently			2
@entity14 must register as a sex offender , but if he follows all the guidelines , he will stay out of prison			1
beyond expressing surprise at the judge 's actions , both sides found little else about which to agree			2
" honestly , i did n't understand when i first heard the sentence , " said @entity8 , now 20			2
" i was expecting him to spend a long time in prison			1
" she spoke of abuse that started when she was 13 , saying she kept quiet for years because of threats			2
" i was hurt for a long time , " she said			2
" i had to grow up at a very , very young age , and i know what it 's like to have your life threatened and that no one will understand me			2
" @entity54 did not return @entity9 's calls friday to explain his ruling			0
the county 's district attorney , @entity58 , told @entity9 he was " reviewing available options to set aside this sentence and to achieve a sentence that gives justice to our victim			2
" @entity58 could not offer specifics on what options are available saying he could not " comment publicly on the particulars of this case			0
" during the sentencing phase of the trial , prosecutors offered evidence that @entity14 had participated in a rehabilitation program for sex offenders when he was a teen			1
@entity14 's attorney confirmed his client 's history			1
" ( @entity14 ) did go through a program			1
he was sent to the @entity80 for a sex abuse case that occurred when he was well under 15 - years - old , " said @entity16			0
regardless of @entity14 's past troubles , from @entity16 's point of view the sentence was too harsh			1
" this is a case with two sides to the coin , " @entity16 said			0
" there are two sides			0
the evidence was not clear and convincing			0
" the lawyer says @entity14 is considering an appeal on the conviction			1
he has 30 days from the sentencing to do so			0
as the sentence stands , the requirements for community corrections are so stringent that they are in effect a form of house arrest , @entity16 said			0
" it sets a bar so high , i do n't know of a lot of people who could abide by these limitations , " he said			0
according to @entity14 's attorney , the relationship should not have happened because @entity14 was married and @entity8 was a minor , but it was consensual			1
@entity8 was good friends with @entity14 's wife and kept going to his house even after the initial attacks , @entity16 said			1
" it does n't appear from her actions that she was saying ' no , ' " he said			0
@entity8 wo n't hear any of that			0
at that young age , she could not legally consent to anything			0
she stayed in @entity14 's life , she said , because she was manipulated and threatened			1
at first , he told her it was ok , but that she could n't tell anyone			0
later , she said , it turned into threats on her life			0
" what am i supposed to do ? " she asked			0
" it takes everything i have to not just hate him			0
" @entity8 said she is in shock			0
" i have absolutely no idea how he got this sentence , " she said .			0
