@entity0 -- chatting casually over a pot of tea in the sleepy village of @entity0 , @entity5 , @entity6 remarks on his time spent in a maximum security prison in @entity9 in 1995 : " that was the one time i contemplated suicide			1
" thrown in with @entity14 gunrunners , @entity16 drug lords and sex offenders , " i would n't have been able to do it myself though , " @entity6 added , stirring in the milk			1
" but there were these two @entity22 boys			2
one of them was an ice cream vendor , @entity25 , and another well - dressed man , @entity26			2
" @entity6 began sipping his tea , and suddenly laughed at how his story sounded like an episode from @entity22 mafia drama @entity32			1
@entity6 , once considered the whiz kid of the @entity35 derivative markets before his bad trades on @entity38 stocks collapsed @entity40 merchant bank @entity39 , was thinking of doing a final deal : one with his own life			1
" it would have cost me Â £ 10,000 ( $ 15,268 ) i think , " he said , struggling to remember , as if the detail is minor			2
" i presumed it would happen in the showers one day , someone would just knife me			2
" from @entity49 to a @entity51 prison as the @entity49 - born @entity6 sat regaling the most definitive time of his life , the anthem from @entity61 " i dreamed a dream , " played on loop at the @entity54 , which is owned by his uncle - in - law			1
@entity6 was due to give a speech for charity in the hotel that evening			1
it provided an eerily fitting soundtrack to his tale			2
the lyrics " i was young and unafraid , and dreams were made and used and wasted " resonate with @entity6 's life			1
he went from high - flying trader to convicted fraudster , spending three and a half years in a gang - ridden @entity51 prison			2
he has now joined @entity74 , an @entity75 restructuring firm			1
at the @entity76 , the couple on the next table appear unaware they are seated next to one of the 20th century 's most infamous financial convicts			2
they 're chatting about the hotel 's renovations while @entity6 is calculating the cost of his trades			1
" the press were saying i could spend up to 84 years in prison , " he said , offering me sugar			0
" you do n't have to be an @entity93 mathematician to work out i was gon na be dead			0
" " i spoke to my wife and father about it [ suicide ] , " he said , explaining that they would have to negotiate the assisted suicide on his behalf from outside prison			0
" obviously they cried but you have to deal with the reality of situation			0
" surviving jail , divorce and cancer almost 20 years on and having weathered incarceration , divorce and colon cancer , the man dubbed the " original rogue trader " now makes his money on the after - dinner speaking circuit ; a far cry from his lucrative days earning $ 76,000 a year with bonuses of up to $ 228,000 as a trader speculating on @entity35 financial markets			1
when asked if he would press a magic button to take it all back , @entity6 told @entity1 : " there is no such button			1
" describing himself as a " realist , " it may be hard to understand how he could have lost $ 1.3 billion , destroying a 233 - year - old bank in the process			0
it 's even harder to understand why he thought he could hide it away in a secret account known as the " five eights			0
" public perception of him as a symbol of capitalist greed may precede him , but @entity6 does n't shirk the responsibility			1
" nobody other than me should be accountable for what went wrong at @entity39 , " he said			1
@entity6 has no sympathy for rogue traders @entity140 of @entity142 and @entity143 of @entity144 , who lost $ 6.4 billion and $ 1.8 billion respectively			1
" anything that they 've done and hidden is fraud			0
" i think it 's a macho culture that 's evolved			0
when things go wrong , there 's a certain age group that is usually involved ; young men			0
" after leaving his desk and fleeing with his wife to @entity155 , @entity6 resurfaced days later and was arrested in @entity156 at the age of 28			1
imprisoned and awaiting deportation to @entity51 , @entity6 started to reflect and accept responsibility for his actions			1
" prison was tough , " said @entity6 , who now found himself mixing with dangerous criminals from the @entity163 and @entity164 underworld			1
" i was the only white guy in there			0
" he rattled off details of a typical day of incarceration : " you 're locked up in a cell for 23 hours a day with two other people			2
you wake up at 6am in the morning and it 's a hundred degrees outside			0
you get three books a month			0
so there 's not much to occupy your mind			0
" @entity6 could still recall the sores on his pelvis , ankles and elbows that he developed from sleeping on the floor			1
at the time , @entity6 said he received messages of support to keep him sane , including nude photographs from air hostesses			1
" i never got the naked pictures , i just got the letter , " he joked			0
" the @entity51 authorities took the good bit away			0
" @entity6 paused for a moment , before recalling the darkest days of his incarceration			1
after a strip search and contraband swipe of his cell , he refused an order to return to a cell with two inmates he feared would fight			0
@entity6 was punished , put in solitary confinement for 31 days			2
" they would turn the lights on at night and turn them off in the day			0
there were no windows and there was a hole that they put your food through			0
" " i used to walk up and down 780 times in the cell and that was an hour			0
that 's how i passed time			2
you start singing to yourself			0
that was hard , because he did n't know the words to many songs			0
after his release from solitary confinement , @entity6 was diagnosed with colon cancer			1
" i had an emergency operation to remove a tumor in my stomach that was 9cm by 5cm			0
" peering over my notebook , he pointed and added quickly as if to make sure i got the all the detail : " oh , and i had six months of chemotherapy in prison			0
" @entity6 was released in 1999 , aged 32			2
broke , and with no job prospects , he returned to the @entity40 , where he continued cancer treatment			2
@entity6 overcame his illness , and set about rebuilding his life			1
he sold his story for a six - figure sum to the @entity231 , wrote a book and had a film made about his time at @entity39 called " @entity235 " starring @entity236			1
but " i 've never seen a penny of it , " he said			0
@entity39 ' liquidators had served @entity6 with an injunction of @entity241 £ 100 million and took 50 % of proceeds from his story			1
" i asked them ' if i got a job flipping burgers , how much would you want ? ' and they told me " half			0
' " a quiet life in @entity75 now 46 , @entity6 lives the quiet life in @entity251 , @entity75 , and it 's difficult to see from his retiring demeanor how he could have destroyed one of the world 's most prestigious institutions			1
@entity6 is philosophical about his past these days : " i created a success story that everyone at the bank wanted to believe			2
" he laughed at how absurd that sounds now			0
asked if a rogue trader will ever bring down a bank again , @entity6 confidently replied : " no doubt about it			1
if you ask anyone in the banking industry , they will say ' yes , but it wo n't be me			0

@entity6 is dubbed the ' original rogue trader ' for bad trades which collapsed @entity39
@entity6 now lives in @entity75 and has joined @entity74 , an @entity75 restructuring firm
@entity6 said his time in a jail , with drug lords and sex offenders , made him consider taking his own life
but he survived incarceration and colon cancer and has since rebuilt his life
