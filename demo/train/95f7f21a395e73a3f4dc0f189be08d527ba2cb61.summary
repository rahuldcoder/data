-- the @entity1 has returned to the geopolitical spotlight , eclipsing the @entity3 as the region 's most volatile flashpoint			1
but quite unlike the @entity7 or the associated @entity10 / @entity9 dispute , the @entity1 's claimant nations are at least as interested in developing the region 's economic potential as they are in asserting sovereignty and building military bases			1
this opens a window to resolving the dispute in a way that looks beyond the traditional frame of sovereignty and towards a win - win economic benefit			1
in the mid-to - late 1990s , @entity26 looked far from stable : naval vessels conducted provocative operations around the appropriately named @entity29 , the @entity25 - @entity7 military relationship was causing headaches with @entity31 , the @entity23 financial crisis destabilized the region 's " @entity38 " economies , and a violent struggle for independence was waged to liberate @entity36 , now known as @entity36 , from @entity37			1
but the decade since has been marked by almost universal growth across the region			0
growth surged from @entity31 to @entity43 , @entity37 became a $ 1 trillion economy , @entity42 rapidly normalized its relations with its neighbors and the world , and the @entity1 became the passageway for large volumes of energy and commodities			2
the main difference between today 's @entity1 dispute and that of two decades ago is that @entity31 is immensely more powerful			1
reflecting its growing clout , @entity31 is asserting its claims far more aggressively , claims which extend right up to the shores of the littoral nations of the @entity1			1
@entity31 claims the entirety of the @entity61 chain , as well as the @entity63 island group which it occupies , and the submerged @entity64 , in a region defined by the so - called " nine - dashed line "			2
@entity31 insists on negotiating bilaterally with other claimant states , dismissing the claims of other nations made in accordance with the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) , insisting that @entity31 exercises " indisputable sovereignty " in the area without fully defining the status of the nine - dashed line			2
@entity31 has built administrative and naval facilities on several islands , bullied vessels from other nations in dangerous and provocative manners not consistent with principles of good seamanship , and marginalized regional body @entity84 's role in attempting to address the dispute			1
most fundamentally , @entity31 's behavior has created a window for the @entity25 to return prominently to the region and shore up fraying alliances , giving the @entity90 and other nations more leverage to stand up to @entity31 , as @entity31 inadvertently pushes the nations of the region toward the @entity25			2
but at best this scenario will lead to stalemate ; militarization restores temporary balance but does not provide long - term solutions			0
most of the islands in the @entity1 are too small to be permanently inhabited without substantial outside assistance , and although the oil , natural gas , and mineral deposits lying beneath have not yet been fully assessed , no nation wants to give up its potentially lucrative claims			1
a similar situation existed a century ago in @entity109 -- and could serve as a role model for @entity26			0
the 1920 @entity111 ( signed during the @entity113 negotiations after @entity114 ) granted @entity116 sovereignty over the @entity111 archipelago , which @entity116 subsequently renamed @entity118 , in the @entity119			0
however , the treaty restricted @entity116 control to some extent , with limited taxation ( at a lower rate than mainland @entity116 ) and provisions to preserve the environment			0
@entity128 bases and other military fortifications were prohibited from the island , and @entity116 was obligated to be legally non-discriminatory against any nation or company from the signatory states seeking to undertake maritime or mining activity on the island			0
@entity116 , then , is effectively the steward of @entity118 , but not necessarily its master			0
the @entity119 , of course , remains disputed in various sectors , and @entity141 even went so far as to famously plant a titanium flagpole under what it thought was the @entity145 in 2007			0
but at the same time , @entity116 and @entity141 also built up sufficient confidence to legally resolve an outstanding maritime boundary dispute in the @entity148 in 2010 , providing the impetus for potential oil and gas exploration			2
as the @entity119 ice cap recedes , more countries are peacefully using the @entity153 to cut shipping time between @entity109 and @entity26			0
most importantly , @entity116 and @entity141 both are massive oil explorers and exporters , not letting territorial disputes interfere with the need to provide for global commodities demand			1
there is much @entity31 and the @entity23 maritime nations can learn from how @entity116 and @entity141 have handled @entity118 and the @entity119			0
parties must agree that the aim is peaceful exploration and exploitation of resources and mutually beneficial sales in international markets			0
since the parties clearly do n't trust each other to politically manage the islands , a joint - stock company should be created and listed on a major neutral regional stock exchange such as @entity175			1
the claimant nations -- through their national energy companies -- would collectively serve as the company 's board			0
this " @entity182 " would effectively be a multi-national joint venture with both legal and commercial authorities			1
in order to circumvent the massive overlapping and mutually exclusive claims to full sovereignty over the islands , all national - corporate members would be recognized as equally entitled to the development of the islands , but only through mutually agreed arrangements			0
in appreciation of @entity31 's cooperation in developing such a multi-national venture , no new claimants should be recognized as parties to the sovereignty dispute , and @entity7 's claim would have to be made in the context of an entity not acting in the capacity of a nation - state -- hence the need for energy companies , not governments , to serve on any board			1
this special purpose vehicle would adjudicate the exploration rights of ships registered and recognized by it in order to continue to guarantee freedom of navigation and passage for shipping , while also respecting environmental concerns with respect to economic development			0
existing occupations of territories would not be forcibly overturned , but the sovereignty question would be shelved for the time being without recognizing or dismissing the claims of the current parties to the dispute			2
much as uncertified conflict diamonds from @entity227 are banned from sale by major private dealers , the same could be true of minerals and energy resources from unregistered deposits and unapproved operations in the @entity1			1
@entity23 nations have been pragmatic about their disputes for over a decade ; all have benefited enormously from regional peace and the associated resultant economic growth			2
today , the claimants in the @entity1 face a choice between resolving the dispute in a creative , regional , and profitable manner versus escalating the conflict and potentially sparking a regional war involving major military powers			1
if @entity26 wants to demonstrate its capacity for independent leadership , it must start by calming its own waters			0
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity252 and @entity253 .			2

@entity252 : territorial disputes in @entity1 can be resolved to everyone 's benefit
@entity259 should put aside territorial claims and start joint venture to exploit the sea 's resources
@entity259 can either resolve dispute profitably , or risk regional war involving major military powers
