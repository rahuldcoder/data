-- this is where it gets really interesting			2
if your interest in the @entity6 died with your ousted team 's dreams , do reconsider			1
because , boy , will you be treated to some fancy footwork today			2
@entity10 vs. @entity11 in the semi-finals			1
it does n't get any more exciting than that			2
( well , until tomorrow , when @entity15 takes on the @entity16			2
) the only time the two nations met at a @entity6 was in the finals in 2002			1
@entity10 won 2 - 0			1
but this time , @entity10 is the unlikely underdog facing the very real possibility of being booted from a @entity6 in their own front yard			1
its goal - scoring talisman , @entity23 , is out with a fractured vertebra			1
and its key defender and captain , @entity27 , is out on a second yellow card			2
( if you get two , you automatically miss the next game )			0
the @entity32 , on the other hand , are on a tear			0
they have efficiently decimated their opponents , and they seem to be getting better and better with every match			2
here are 5 things you should know about today 's matchup : 1			0
it 's @entity41 time @entity23 's gone			1
@entity43 's @entity42 is gone			0
@entity45 's @entity44 is gone			0
@entity11 's @entity41 may very well emerge as the best player in this tournament			0
with his power and pace , @entity41 's scored four goals and helped with two more so far			0
fun fact : back home , @entity41 stars in a yoghurt commercial for , what else , @entity54			0
getting @entity56 - r to a record let 's not forget that other @entity32 dynamo , @entity56			1
he 's scored at least one goal in the last four @entity6 tournaments ( only two other players can boast that )			1
and if he scores today , he becomes the most prolific goal scorer in @entity6 history with 16			1
he 's tied with @entity10 's @entity42 at the moment			2
fun fact : @entity42 scored his 15th goal against @entity70 in @entity11			2
@entity56 scored his 15th goal against @entity70 , in @entity10			1
do n't rule out the one - name wonders @entity10 has held up the @entity6 trophy more times than anyone else ( five )			1
and the ugly , uber - physical game it played against @entity45 showed that it will do whatever it takes to get that trophy			0
it has committed more fouls than any other team ( 96 ) and , according to a @entity82 analysis , faked the most injuries			1
while @entity23 wo n't be there , @entity10 will have the home crowd acting as its 12th man			1
and it still has two formidable attackers in @entity87 and @entity88 ( yes , he 's named after the comic book character )			0
fun fact : so many @entity92 players go by one name because that 's just the convention in the country			0
even the former president , @entity97 , was known by his nickname @entity97			0
keep an eye on the keepers @entity11 's @entity101 has been unbelievable , charging out of his box to clear ball after ball			0
he 's only allowed in 3 goals in 5 matches			0
@entity10 's goalie @entity107 has yet to concede more than one goal in any game			1
those who say he is n't the player he once was were silenced when he saved two penalties against @entity113 and helped @entity10 advance			1
fun fact : @entity101 won $ 680,000 in the @entity32 version of " who wants to be @entity117 ? " 5			0
a word on the card - carrier the man refereeing the match will be @entity122 , the same guy who failed to see -- or punish -- @entity124 's @entity123 when he chomped down on the shoulder of @entity127 defender @entity126			1
otherwise , @entity44 came into the tournament as the most card - happy official			0
he sent off 51 players in 70 matches			0
( at the @entity6 , he red - carded @entity133 's @entity132			2
) fun fact : in @entity135 , @entity44 is known as " @entity136 " for his apparent resemblance to the actor who plays the character in a tv show there			0

@entity10 , without @entity23 , is the unlikely underdog
if he scores , @entity56 becomes *highest* goal scorer in @entity6 history
@entity10 has committed more fouls than any other team
referee for match is the man who did n't notice @entity123 bite
