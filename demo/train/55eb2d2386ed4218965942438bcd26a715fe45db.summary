-- republicans are consoling themselves with the claim that president @entity3 did n't win a mandate tuesday night , even if he did renew his @entity6 lease for another four years			1
they are fooling themselves , however , if they think the 2012 election merely ratified the political status quo			0
more than just a personal victory for @entity3 , the outcome was an unmistakable defeat for @entity14 ideology			1
disgruntled conservatives , of course , are already dressing @entity17 for the part of fall guy			0
but this is the politics of evasion			0
sooner or later , @entity14 realists will have to reappraise the party 's message rather than shoot its messenger			2
that message was a call for rolling back government			0
@entity31 by a potent brew of resurgent libertarian dogma and intense personal animus toward @entity3 , republicans vowed to undo his major achievements : health care reform , new rules for financial markets , the regulation of carbon emissions , higher fuel economy standards for autos , and so on			0
conservatives also railed against an alleged epidemic of dependency on government ; called for deep spending cuts ( but no tax hikes ) to reduce public deficits ; threatened to roll back women 's reproductive rights ; and took extreme positions on tax , immigration and energy issues that seemed calculated to thwart bipartisan compromise			0
such tea party radicalism seemed to work in 2010 , amid acute public dissatisfaction with the slow pace of economic recovery			2
but a different electorate -- larger , more moderate and more @entity64 -- rejected the conservative vision this time			0
in effect , the pragmatic center reasserted itself on tuesday			0
according to exit polls , a plurality of voters , 41 % , were moderates , and they favored @entity3 by 15 points			1
in general , voters viewed @entity3 as more for the middle class and republicans as tilting toward the interests of the rich			2
they did not accept @entity17 's claims that @entity3 has been an incompetent economic manager ; nearly half the voters instead blamed the weak economy on his predecessor			1
opinion : @entity3 's critics , repudiated at last and for all the @entity14 's ceaseless demonization of @entity86 , the issue seemed to work in the president 's favor			1
exit polls say health care registered as the voters ' second most important concern ( albeit a distant second to the economy and jobs )			1
@entity3 won massively among these voters , which suggests that @entity14 promises to kill health care reform may have backfired by spurring greater intensity among its advocates			1
some republicans point hopefully to the fact that the election barely changed the existing composition of political forces in @entity106			0
that 's true , but this was an election they could have won			0
with stubbornly high unemployment and the president 's low approval ratings ( often below the previously supposed " ca n't win " threshold of 50 % ) , the @entity14 had objective reality on their side			2
instead , they blew it by indulging in pathological partisanship and ideological hubris			0
the big question now is whether @entity14 will accept the lessons of their defeat or take refuge in the usual alibis			2
the biggest lesson , of course , is they lost because they picked the wrong candidate -- a @entity128 moderate who did n't given the country a clear choice between undiluted conservatism and @entity3 's alleged ultra-liberalism			1
this electoral math is no better than @entity17 's budget math. @entity136 may list slightly to the center - right , but no party can cede the center and win			0
what @entity14 really need is an analogue to the new @entity143 movement of the 1990s -- a determined effort by moderates and pragmatists to reassert control over their party 's agenda and electoral strategies			1
whether they realize that is another matter : democrats had to lose four out of five presidential elections between 1968 and 1992 before finally accepting that their message could no longer command electoral majorities			0
opinion : @entity3 will get little time to celebrate republicans do n't have that luxury			2
tuesday 's results made it blindingly obvious that the @entity14 's political strategy of relying almost exclusively on white voters already has reached a dead end			1
as expected , white turnout was 72 % , according to exit polls , two points down from 2008 , and is projected to be two points lower in 2016			1
the @entity14 's bet on a kind of white identity politics -- which dates back to @entity175 's successful 1966 run for governor in @entity177 and was ruthlessly perfected by @entity178 in 1972 -- is played out			1
meanwhile , what the @entity180 's @entity179 calls the @entity64 ' " coalition of the ascendant " is growing by about the same amount every four years			0
this coalition includes minorities , young voters and women ( especially single women ) , along with highly educated white professionals			0
as they pore over election returns , expect @entity14 strategists to look especially ruefully at @entity193 voters			2
@entity3 won them by 71 % to 27 % , according to exit polls , improving on his 2008 performance			1
assuming that @entity197 would focus mainly on their economic struggles and ignore the @entity14 's harshly anti-immigrant stance , proved to be a major miscalculation			2
a conservative governing philosophy centered on exploiting white voters ' sense of cultural dispossession is a formula for political marginalization , if not demographic suicide			1
any honest post-mortem of the 2012 election should lead @entity14 strategists to this inescapable conclusion : it 's the ideology , stupid			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity3 's *re-election* was an unmistakable defeat for @entity14 ideology , says @entity215
@entity222 radicalism seemed to work in 2010 , but not this time , he says
according to exit polls , a plurality of voters were moderates , says @entity215
the @entity14 strategy of relying on white voters has reached a dead end , he says
