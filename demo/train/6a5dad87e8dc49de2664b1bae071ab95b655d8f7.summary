@entity0 -- @entity3 's parents said tuesday they are " satisfied " with the sentence handed down to their daughter 's killer , as @entity4 started his first full day in a @entity6 prison			1
june and @entity11 told broadcaster @entity13 's " @entity22 " show that they accepted the five - year prison term @entity4 was given tuesday -- although they feel there 's still a " big missing piece of the puzzle " concerning their daughter 's final moments			1
" he 's got to pay for what he 's done , " said @entity23			0
" it 's not that we want vengeance or anything or him to suffer with his disabilities , but at the same time we feel satisfied that he will realize now that you ca n't go around doing things like that			1
" " we have gone along with the judge and her decision , " her husband said			0
" only @entity4 knows whether that sentence is acceptable to him ; i 've got my feelings to the whole thing but we do accept what the judge handed down			1
" @entity4 , who won global renown as a medal - winning double amputee track star before his dramatic fall from grace , woke up wednesday morning in @entity51 prison , formerly known as @entity52			1
he was convicted of culpable homicide , or negligent killing , but cleared of murder			0
his uncle , @entity56 , said the family accepted the sentence and that his nephew would " embrace this opportunity to pay back to society			0
" ' more to the story ' asked if she believed the athlete 's account that he shot @entity3 through a locked toilet door under the mistaken belief that she was an intruder , @entity23 expressed skepticism			1
" no -- there 's more to the whole story than everybody knows , only @entity4 knows , " she said			1
her doubts are based in part on the evidence heard in court that @entity3 was at times scared of @entity4			1
" she described exactly how she felt and that he was n't treating her properly , he was always irritable with her and snapped quickly , so we know all of that so that 's why we feel that it is not actually what happened , " said @entity23			2
the couple were disappointed , " even shocked , " that @entity4 was cleared of murder , she said , but feel that perhaps insufficient facts were put before the judge			1
@entity11 told " @entity22 " they had known " very little " about their daughter 's relationship with @entity4 before she was killed on february 14 last year			1
if an appeal is lodged over the sentence , they will have to accept it , hard though that may be , his wife said			0
the key thing , she said , is that he will now realize in prison what he has done			0
" i think he has lost everything but now he has to pay for what he has done to our daughter and no words can actually describe what that has done to us -- but we have to live with this now for the rest of our lives without her and it 's so difficult to go through this and to have that pain in your heart and in your soul for her			0
" blankets , place to sleep @entity122 , of @entity123 , told @entity1 that @entity4 was one of nine disabled offenders now held at the prison , notorious during the apartheid era for its harsh treatment of political prisoners			1

there , he will have undergone a health risk assessment within six hours of arrival , @entity122 said			0
within 21 days , a comprehensive assessment of his needs will be done			0
" he was allocated blankets , a place to sleep , " @entity122 said			0
" the second day he will undergo an orientation and induction process which includes explaining to him the services available to him in the correctional center and ensuring he knows the dos and don'ts			2
" the prison has 7,217 inmates in total , just over 4,700 of whom have been sentenced , with the remainder in custody awaiting trial , @entity122 added			2
the defense argued during the sentencing hearing that @entity4 was too vulnerable to be sent to prison and should be sentenced to house arrest with community service			1
but judge @entity162 ruled that the prison system was equipped to cater for @entity4 ' needs			2
@entity166 jumpsuit prison commissioner @entity167 said tuesday that @entity4 was placed in a cell for one person in the hospital section of the prison			1
