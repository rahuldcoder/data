@entity1 mayor @entity0 thursday announced a settlement in the long legal battle over the police department 's controversial stop - and - frisk policies , which a federal judge ruled violated the rights of minority residents			1
in addition to dropping its appeal of the ruling , the city will implement reforms aimed at improving strained relations between police and the community			1
@entity17 , who targeted the policing practice during his mayoral campaign to succeed @entity20 , called the settlement ending the @entity21 of @entity1 case " historic " and said it closes the years - long legal fight that found the overuse of stop - and - frisk unconstitutional			1
@entity17 said 90 % of the people who were stopped and frisked were innocent of any crimes			1
" we 're here today to turn the page on one of the most divisive problems in our city , " he told reporters			2
" we believe in ending the overuse of stop - and - frisk that has unfairly targeted young african - american and @entity38 men			1
... we believe in one city where everyone rises together , respecting every @entity1 's rights regardless of what neighborhood they live in or the color of their skin			1
" in august 2013 , a federal judge ruled that stop - and - frisk violated the @entity49 and ordered the city to develop remedies			1
the ruling stemmed from a class - action lawsuit representing potentially hundreds of thousands of people that never asked for monetary damages			2
they instead sued to have the policy changed			2
" we have been in negotiations with the city since the new administration came into office ... so it was n't a surprise , " @entity59 , senior staff attorney at the @entity60 , told @entity61			0
" but we still obviously consider today to be a very important step along a long struggle that goes back a decade			0
" @entity59 and others will now enter a new phase of talks with city officials in a collaborative attempt to reform the policy that dictates how and when police officers can stop and question someone on the street			1
" we are definitely cautiously optimistic that this can be a collaborative effort and we will work with them , but we also will remain vigilant throughout the process to hold them accountable to their promises , " he said			0
the much - criticized method , in which police stopped and searched those they considered suspicious , had been used to deter crime , the police department said			1
but it has also resulted in a slew of lawsuits by residents complaining of unlawful stops			1
" we will not break the law to enforce the law , " said the new police commissioner , @entity95			0
" that 's my solemn promise to every @entity1 , regardless of where they were born , where they live or what they look like			2
" @entity95 stopped short of calling the previous administration 's stop - and - frisk activity a quota system , but said it was " quite clear officers were strongly encouraged , were expected to produce activity			1
" " the officers themselves were asking why more , " he said			0
" they were being pushed to do more			0
i think that 's clearly understood			0
" last year , then - police commissioner @entity114 said the department did not engage in racial profiling			2
under the agreement with plaintiffs who sued the city over the practice , a court - appointed monitor will oversee the @entity124 's reforms of the policy for three years			1
the monitor will report to a federal court on the city 's progress			0
the city will also take part in a process with community members " to ensure people affected by stop - and - frisk play an active role in shaping reform , " @entity0 said in a statement			1
police department figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people " stopped and frisked " in 2011 were @entity140 or @entity141			1
the data showed that of the 685,724 stops made by police that year , 53 % of those questioned were black , 34 % were @entity38 , 9 % were white and 3 % were @entity146			2
the citywide population in 2011 was 23.4 % black , 29.4 % @entity141 , 12.9 % @entity146 and 34.3 % @entity148 white , according to the report			0
one of the subjects of the stops appeared with @entity0 at thursday 's press conference			0
the first time @entity154 , who is black , was stopped and frisked by police officers he was celebrating his 18th birthday			2
it happened three more times in the years since , despite having never committed a crime , he said			0
it prompted him to become a plaintiff the lawsuit			0
" we have made some significant steps , " said @entity154 , now 25			0
" this is a small part of a larger battle that we have			0
