-- @entity3 , a 10 - year - old @entity4 girl with cystic fibrosis whose family fought to have young children prioritized for adult organs , received new lungs wednesday , her family told @entity0			1
her surgery took about six hours , and there were no complications resizing or transplanting the adult lungs , according to family spokeswoman @entity14			1
a statement said the family was elated and that the doctors say @entity3 's prognosis is good			1
" we expect it will be a long road , but we 're not going for easy , we 're going for possible			0
and an organ donor has made this possible for her , " the family said , calling the family of the deceased person who donated the lungs " true heroes			0
" @entity3 " did extremely well " and was in intensive care after the procedure , @entity29 said			2
the parents ' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight			2
earlier this week , the @entity39 and @entity41 's executive committee approved a one - year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists			1
@entity3 received lungs donated by an adult , according to @entity29 , meaning the lungs needed to be modified			2
an @entity50 news release said monday that since 2007 only one patient younger than 12 had received adult lungs			2
@entity3 has been in and out of hospitals her entire life , but her condition worsened this year			2
her lungs had been deteriorating rapidly over the past few months -- much faster than anyone in her family expected			0
in may , doctors told her mother , @entity60 , that @entity3 had less than five weeks to live			2
with just weeks left , @entity3 fights the system for life - saving pair of lungs " we knew at some point , she would need new lungs , " her father , @entity64 , said in may			0
" we had hoped it would be much further down the road , but the disease has progressed			0
" at that time , @entity3 had been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months			0
the @entity74 were under the impression that the transplant would happen any day , since she was the first candidate on the priority list for children in her region			2
but children 's organs rarely become available			1
in 2012 , there were just 10 transplants in @entity3 's age group , according to the @entity85			1
comparatively , there were more than 1,700 adult transplants in the same year			0
only people 12 years and older qualified for the adult lungs			0
doctors previously have said they believe modified adult lungs could save @entity3 's life			1
last week , the @entity74 contacted a lawyer , who petitioned @entity95 secretary @entity94 to change the rules that keep children under 12 from being prioritized for donated lungs			2
@entity94 had previously told the family that she did n't have the authority to intervene in a particular case , but she did also call for a policy review			0
any change in the policy , though , could take up to two years -- time the @entity74 did n't have			0
so in the letter last week they argued the rule was making it all but impossible for @entity3 to receive a lung ; every adult on the list would have to turn down the lung to let the little girl have it			1
" the under 12 rule is unfair , arbitrary and capricious , inconsistent with the statute and regulations , and stands in the way of @entity3 potentially receiving a set of lungs that she needs to live , " wrote @entity114 , the family 's lawyer			1
dying girl 's plight sparks fight over organ transplants " we have never , ever asked that @entity3 get special attention or be placed in front of anyone more severe than her , " her father said at the time			1
" so if there ... is another adult who is more severe , who has a higher lung allocation score , they will still get their lungs first			0
" several factors determine someone 's place in line on the adult list : distance from donor to potential recipient , a lung allocation score determined by a patient 's diagnosis and test results , and a patient 's blood type			2
@entity3 's parents said her score was a 78			1
it went up to a 91 this week , according to a family spokeswoman			0
anything above 60 is considered a high score , according to the @entity50 's ranking system , and means a transplant need is particularly urgent			0
several lawmakers also got involved urging @entity94 to act			0
rep. @entity160 and sen. @entity161 , two @entity162 , co-signed a letter sent to @entity95			0
it read : " you have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for @entity3 and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs			1
" on june 5 , the @entity3 family asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block @entity94 from having the agency that oversees transplants apply the policy			1
the judge granted the injunction and ordered @entity94 to direct the @entity85 to waive the rule in @entity3 's case			1
a letter from @entity94 was sent to the @entity50 the following day directing them to comply with the judge 's order			0
@entity50 created a second candidate record for @entity3 that fudged her birth date so the system would treat her as a 12 - year - old allowing her to wait on the adult transplant list			1
her original record as a 10 - year - old also was kept , allowing her to remain first in line for a pediatric lung donation , as well			0
on the same day he granted the injunction in @entity3 's case , judge @entity193 also granted a similar injunction in the case of 11 - year - old @entity197 , making him eligible for adult lung			1
mother who lost one son fights for the other to get new lungs on monday , the @entity50 took further action , with the group 's executive committee approving the change for children under 12			1
@entity0 's @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0
