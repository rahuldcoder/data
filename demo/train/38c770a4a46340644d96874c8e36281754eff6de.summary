president @entity0 told @entity2 governors attending a luncheon monday that they are cutting too much funding for education and need to make reforms while continuing to invest in the future of @entity2 's students			1
while acknowledging the tough economic climate for state governments , @entity0 cited the need to prioritize the long - range significance of a strong education system			1
" we 've all faced some stark choices over the past several years , but that is no excuse to lose sight of what matters most , and the fact is that too many states are making cuts to education that i believe are simply too big , " @entity0 told a @entity14 gathering with the @entity15 that included some of his harshest @entity18 critics			1
" nothing more clearly signals what you value as a state than the decisions you make about where to invest , " @entity0 said			2
" budgets are about choices , so today i 'm calling on all of you : invest more in education , invest more in our children and in our future			2
" the luncheon is an annual affair that highlights the constant tension over funding issues between the federal government and states			0
one table included @entity18 governors and constant @entity0 foes @entity49 of @entity50 , @entity51 of @entity52 , @entity53 of @entity54 and @entity55 of @entity56			1
@entity0 noted the economic outlook is improving from the early days of his administration , saying , " our recovery is gaining speed			2
" however , he warned that a failure to maintain significant government investment in education now would cause economic harm in the future by leaving @entity2 workers unable to compete in a global marketplace			0
" i realize everybody is dealing with limited resources			0
trust me , i know something about dealing with tight budgets , " @entity0 said before citing statistics on decreasing numbers of teachers and higher university costs			1
" no issue will have a bigger impact on the future performance of our economy than education , " @entity0 said , adding that the unemployment rate for @entity2 with a college degree is roughly half the national average			2
" their incomes are about twice as high as those who only have a high school diploma , " he added			1
" so this is what we should be focused on as a nation			0
it is what we should be talking about and debating			0
the countries who out - educate us today will out - compete us tomorrow			0
that 's a simple fact			0
" @entity18 presidential candidate @entity99 called @entity0 a " snob " last week because the president advocates that @entity2 students to go to college			1
@entity99 framed the issue as @entity0 seeking to indoctrinate young @entity2 in what @entity99 called the liberal leanings of a majority of @entity2 colleges and universities over a four - year college career			2
@entity0 , however , made clear monday that he was talking about all kinds of higher education , including community colleges and specialized training programs to help young people prepare to enter the modern work force			1
" when i speak about higher education , we 're not just talking about a four - year degree , " @entity0 said			1
the first step is creating a national expectation that all students graduate high school , " at a minimum , " the president said			1
at the same time , federal and state governments need to do what they can to make college affordable , he added			0
" @entity2 now owe more in student loan debt than they do in credit card debt , " @entity0 said , adding that " state budget cuts have been a major factor in rising tuition costs at state universities			2
" insisting that " all of us have to do more , " @entity0 said , " we ca n't allow higher education to be a luxury in this country			1
" it 's an economic imperative that every family in @entity2 has to be able to afford and , and frankly i do n't think any of this should be a partisan issue , " he continued to applause			0
" all of us should be about giving every @entity2 who wants to succeed that chance			0
" after the meeting , @entity51 and fellow @entity146 gov. @entity146 of @entity147 said they agreed with @entity0 's thinking			1
" i think that we all realize that everybody 's not going to be headed to college , that we have to have ... community colleges and good job training , " said @entity51 , who has repeatedly clashed with @entity0 on immigration policy			2
" we need people that fit in with those kinds of skills that they have			0
so all of that 's really , really important			0
" @entity146 questioned @entity99 's wording when the presidential contender accused @entity0 of snobbery for advocating higher education			1
" i wish he 'd said it differently , " @entity146 said , adding : " i think what we say is , we want someone to be career ready or college ready			0
if we have n't done one of those two things for the young people , we 've failed you			0
you do n't have access to the @entity2 dream			0
" the bottom line , @entity146 said , is that " when you look what 's going on in other countries -- @entity182 , @entity181 , the premium they put on higher education -- we 've got to do better if we still want to be the global leader we are			1
