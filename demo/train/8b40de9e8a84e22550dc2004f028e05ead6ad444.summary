@entity0 -- he 's the 20 - something blogger who created the iconic @entity4 action figure			0
he 's also the @entity0 - based gadget fan who worked his supplier contacts in @entity7 to leak authentic components of the latest ipad before the official launch			2
and yet , despite his devotion to all things @entity13 , @entity12 's @entity11 says if it came down to just one device -- he would choose a @entity7 - branded smartphone over the @entity18			1
" i like spending less money to get a similar performance from the @entity18 or @entity22 series , " says @entity11			0
" the @entity7 - branded smartphone is my choice			2
" @entity11 shows me his preferred smartphone -- the roughly $ 400 @entity27			0
the @entity29 - powered phone is just 6.65 millimeters thin -- thinner than the @entity18			0
that said , it 's not a 4g handset			0
but it 's enough for @entity11 and a growing number of discerning @entity7 smartphone users			2
@entity7 is forecast to overtake the @entity36 in smartphone shipments and become the world 's leading smartphone market this year , according to research group @entity40			1
break it down by marketshare and , according to @entity44 , in the first half of 2012 , three of the top five smartphones sold in @entity7 are local @entity7 brands : @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
all three individually outsell @entity13 's @entity18 in @entity7			1
the mainland @entity7 smartphone market has been partly fueled by the demand for lower - cost handsets			1
in @entity7 , a @entity53 sells for @entity54 , 488 ( $ 712 )			0
traditionally , @entity49 and @entity48 have been selling to the lower - end of the market , below @entity57 ( $ 160 )			1
but @entity7 's @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity27 are climbing up the value chain -- not so high as to angle for the top tier of the market with @entity13 and @entity22 , but right in the middle			1
" @entity58 , @entity27 and @entity59 are poised to differentiate themselves as strong mid-range smartphones , like a sedan , " says @entity65 , @entity7 editor of @entity66			1
" at rmb 1,999 ( $ 317 ) , the ( @entity59 ) @entity69 will be ' good enough ' for millions of consumers who are n't willing to spring for the more expensive devices			0
" @entity58 was formerly the coveted smartphone brand in @entity7 , but that mantle has passed on to @entity59 which -- like @entity13 -- masterfully markets its technology like a lifestyle			1
@entity59 is the smartphone cult hero in @entity7 with its intensely loyal fans who adore the company 's charismatic founder , @entity82 , and the brand 's distinctive style			1
bottom line -- in @entity7 today , it 's cool to have a @entity59 phone			1
" watching a thousand @entity59 fans give @entity82 and the new phone a standing ovation last month really drove home the company 's success at connecting with its customers , " says @entity65			2
so how can the rest of the world get their hands on a cult @entity7 smartphone ? well , you ca n't			2
they 're only available in @entity7			0
@entity59 may have an @entity105 language @entity103 feed , but it did n't want to lend its @entity107 phone for review to international audiences on @entity1 's @entity110			0
( we had to borrow the phone from @entity11			0
) @entity58 has an @entity105 language @entity113 , but there 's no option provided to buy the phone			0
there is , however , a retail store outside the mainland ... in the @entity7 territory of @entity0			0
the fan base for @entity7 's sleekest smartphones will remain in @entity7 for now .			2
