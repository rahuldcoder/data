@entity0 -- everybody it seems has to wait in line -- at the airport gate , the grocery checkout or the opera recital			0
the question before the @entity9 on wednesday : if it occurs on the job site , should you get paid for it ? in one of the most closely watched business cases of the term , the justices appeared split during oral arguments , on whether time spent going through after - shift security screenings for warehouse employees is compensable under the @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
the company , which provides staffing for @entity23 , justifies the policy for contract employees , to prevent workplace theft			1
but labor rights groups say the waiting is " integral and indispensable " to workers ' overall job activities and deserving of overtime payment			1
the financial stakes are huge , since those hours of overtime for potentially tens of thousands of employees can add up to billions , say both sides			0
the law in question does not allow workers to be paid for " pre- or post-liminary " activities not directly related to core employment duties			1
defining those limits has been vexing @entity42 and the courts for nearly eight decades			0
discussions of principal activity " what 's a principal activity ? " requiring compensation , asked justice @entity47 of the anti-theft measures			1
" how is it defined ? and so i think , is n't a principal activity work that benefits the employer in some way ? " @entity56 of @entity57 provides employment contracting and storage services for a variety of companies , including mega online retailer @entity23			1
@entity62 and @entity63 are two former integrity warehouse workers whose responsibilities included taking items form shelves and fulfilling them for delivery			1
they brought suit , claiming having to regularly wait nearly a half hour at the end of their shifts to go through mandatory security checks			0
employees had to remove personal items like keys and wallets , and allow purses , coats , and backpacks to be searched			0
they also had to go through electronic and metal detector screening , to ensure no company property was being smuggled out , called " shrinkage " in the retail world			1
integrity argues heightened security is a workplace reality in the post 9/11 world , and that measures designed to keep workers safe -- and preserve the financial bottom line -- are necessary , but not subject to a larger paycheck			1
the workers say screening here took time because many shifts ended at the same time , causing a mass exodus of employees seeking to leave the warehouse at the same time -- when they had already punched the time clock			1
the company cited its data showing the waits were minimal most of the time			2
what role does staffing levels have ? during the one - hour arguments , the court debated about what the case really comes down to : money			1
" because there are not enough security checkers and because all the shifts get out at the same time , what could be a five - minute [ screening ] process turns out to be 25 minutes , " said justice @entity114			2
" and 20 of those allegedly would not occur if the employer had provided sufficient staffing			0
" @entity125 is n't the long line caused by very few checkers for the benefit of the employer ? it 's for the benefit of the employer to hire fewer checkers			2
" nothing wrong with that , countered justice @entity135			0
the employer " could move his plant , for example , to be closer to the city where the employees live , right ? " he said			0
" it 's his fault that it takes them an hour instead of just 10 minutes , and he should move his plant ? it 's just a matter of cost , right ? " now about that grapefruit judge justice @entity146 offered a more personal example			2
" there was a [ federal ] judge ages ago in the @entity155 who had his clerks , " in addition to their primary judicial duties , " come early in order to cut his grapefruit and otherwise make breakfast for him			0
and would that be compensable ? " " well , setting aside the question of whether the law clerks were covered by the @entity20 to begin with , " @entity162 lawyer @entity161 started to say in his best legalese			0
" yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , " replied @entity146 , smiling , who herself personally hires and employs four law clerks for prestigious one - year terms			2
the grapefruit judge was left otherwise unidentified			0
the @entity171 administration is backing the company in the current dispute , although government lawyers said there may instances where some security searches would be compensable			2
questions over how to read old law several on the bench suggested the screening activity was not subject to payment , because of its very nature			0
" no one 's principal activity is going through security screening			2
the employer does n't hire somebody : i need somebody to go through employee screening , " said chief justice @entity190			0
" he hires them to do something else			0
" but the @entity197 workers ' lawyer @entity195 replied , " their overall function is to move merchandise without losing it			2
if they do n't -- if they ship to the wrong address , if they drop it in the wrong bin and it ca n't be received , it 's not there the next day they look for that particular item in that particular bin , then they have n't done their job			2
and if they steal , it 's the same thing			0
" @entity190 , tersely : " well then , i guess i do n't understand what ' principal ' means			0
" the @entity9 in 1956 concluded , " activities performed either before or after the regular work shift , on or off the production line , are compensable under the portal - to - portal [ door - to - door ] provisions of the @entity20 if those activities are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed			1
" that case involved factory workers who were ordered paid for the time needed to shower after their assembly line shifts handling toxic chemicals			1
subsequent appeals dealt with whether miners had to be paid for the time spent traveling on trams , miles down the shafts to the coal seams ; or loggers being transported long distances in buses to remote forest sites			0
the justices in january said union workers could be paid for the time it takes to " doff and don " safety equipment , as part a collective bargaining agreement			1
other things like walking from the company parking lot , or attending a company picnic would not typically be compensable , even if they occurred on work property , or were activities sponsored by the employer			1
the case is @entity56 v. @entity63 ( 13 - 433 )			1
a ruling is expected in the next few months			0
@entity9 allows same - sex marriage to begin in @entity262 , keeps it on hold in @entity264			1
