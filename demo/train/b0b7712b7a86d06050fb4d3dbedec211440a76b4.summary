-- more than 1,000 miles away from the jungle where rebels allegedly kidnapped and killed his father , @entity1 is seeking justice			1
he filed a lawsuit in a @entity8 court this month , 13 years after the bullet - riddled body of his father -- a former senator and @entity12 ambassador -- was found on a dirt road in northern @entity14			1
in the civil complaint , @entity15 -- who now lives in @entity8 after receiving political asylum in the @entity17 -- says he was forced to flee his home country , abandoning property and businesses , and he wants those responsible to pay			1
the defendants are two guerrilla groups that have been at war with the @entity14 government for decades : the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) and the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			1
@entity15 " has suffered and continues to suffer emotional , psychological and economic damages " since rebel forces kidnapped , tortured and killed his father , the lawsuit says			1
he alleges that their actions violated @entity8 racketeering statutes and @entity17 federal laws , and that @entity14 laws hold the rebel groups liable for wrongful death			1
he aims to get " tens of millions of dollars " in damages , the law firm representing him said in a statement			1
but the money is only part of the battle , attorney @entity44 said			0
" there is a record that needs to be made			0
... people should not forget the horrific acts of brutality , " he said			1
" they took a person who was one of the most prominent people in the nation and discarded his body on a dirt road			0
" @entity1 's father , @entity59 , was a former @entity14 senator , political party leader and ambassador to the @entity12			1
he was 76 years old when he was taken hostage in february 1999 , according to the complaint			0
the politician was found dead more than six months later , the complaint says , after rebels had demanded a ransom of $ 6 million for his release			0
during the 184 days that they held him hostage , rebel forces tortured him daily , forcing him to walk through the jungle for hours and depriving him of food and water , according to the complaint			0
records from the @entity14 government 's human rights observatory also blame rebels for the death			2
according to the lawsuit , @entity59 was targeted because of his political positions against the rebel groups and because property he owned could be used to facilitate drug production and transport			1
although the killing occurred in @entity14 , the lawsuit argues that @entity17 federal laws -- including the @entity89 and the @entity90 -- give @entity17 courts jurisdiction in the case			2
the lawsuit was filed in @entity8 's @entity96 @entity95 because of the groups ' alleged drug trafficking activities in the state , and because @entity1 lives there now and returning to @entity14 to file a claim " would place his life in extreme peril , " the complaint says			1
" he 's under an ongoing threat that forces him to work within our system , " @entity44 said			0
there has been no comment on the case published on websites that the rebel groups typically use to release information			1
this is n't the first time @entity14 rebels have been tied to lawsuits in the @entity17			2
other lawsuits have been filed against the @entity24 in federal court , records show -- including a pending 2009 case seeking damages filed by three @entity17 contractors who were held hostage by the guerrilla group			2
that case seeks garnishment of millions of dollars in frozen assets from @entity17 bank accounts connected to the @entity24			2
the @entity17 has designated both the @entity24 and the @entity28 as foreign terrorist organizations			0
" these groups foster violence and instability ... in an attempt to advance their political agendas , and largely finance their operations through the illicit drug trade , " @entity132 , chief of intelligence for the @entity134 , said in congressional testimony last year			0
the @entity17 @entity144 describes the @entity24 as " @entity146 's oldest , largest , most capable , and best - equipped insurgency of @entity148 origin " and notes that it has " well - documented ties to a range of drug trafficking activities " tactics include " bombings , murder , mortar attacks , kidnapping , extortion , and hijacking , as well as guerrilla and conventional military action against @entity14 political , military , and economic targets , " the center says			2
@entity15 's lawsuit comes amid renewed peace talks between the @entity14 government and @entity24 rebels , who have been meeting in @entity167 , @entity168			0
@entity44 said tuesday that the case 's goal " is not to interject itself in the negotiations , " but he hopes the lawsuit will bring the group 's tactics to light			0
" terrorism is n't just something in the @entity179 , " he said			0
" it 's alive and well in the @entity181 as well , and it cost this man his life			0
