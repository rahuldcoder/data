@entity0 , @entity1 -- for just a moment we can hardly believe what is happening			1
the boyish leader takes a step towards the microphone , the massed ranks of the huge army he commands poised before him			2
the adoring crowd who have been chanting his name falls silent			2
@entity13 , not yet 30 years old , appears slightly nervous			1
his voice does n't waver but his body moves back and forth restlessly and his eyes dart around			2
if his nerves betray him slightly , his words stay strong			2
he stands atop the shoulders of the men who have gone before him , his grandfather and father			2
directly below him hang the huge portraits of the man @entity1 call the @entity26 , @entity26 , and his son the so - called @entity27 , @entity27			1
@entity1 marks founder 's 100th birthday the third generation of the @entity13 dynasty pledges to build on his family 's legacy			1
but already , just with this speech , he is veering from their path			0
it is something his father never did			0
@entity1 i speak to say they ca n't recall ever hearing his voice			1
to be here now is " the greatest gift i have received in my life , " one man says			0
@entity13 is speaking to two audiences : his people and the outside world he stands apart from			1
the newly - crowned @entity51 has a vowed to try to unite the fractured @entity53 nation , still separated after more than half a century			1
" we have suffered the pain of separation for nearly 70 years , " he declares			2
" we have lived as one people on the same land for thousands of years to suffer like this is heartbreaking			2
" our party and our government will work with anyone who truly wants reunification			0
" but this is not a day for talk of peace			0
this is a military parade with all the menace this isolated nation can muster			0
to @entity1 this says they can defend themselves			1
to their enemies , especially the @entity76 , there is a deadly message			0
" our military has become a powerful military able to handle any kind of modern warfare , with complete offensive and defensive capabilities , " @entity13 says			1
" the foreign powers are not the only ones with monopoly on military supremacy , and the days of their threatening and lying to us with atomic weapons is forever gone			0
" it is 100 years since the birth of the founding father of the nation , @entity26			1
installed as leader by @entity97 in 1945 after the liberation and the separation of @entity100 , he is still revered as a freedom fighter and hero			0
to honor his birthday , the military , one of the largest on earth , shows off its arsenal			0
soldiers -- men and women -- goose step with precision , while columns of tanks bearing the message " we will smash the @entity76 imperialists " roll across the great parade square			0
the latest hi - tech weapons then follow , including drones and missiles that could potentially strike targets thousands of miles away			0
this is an army battle ready , a country still technically at war and soldiers determined to follow any order			0
" with the strategy of the great leader @entity26 , the dear @entity27 and @entity13 , and with our bombs and weapons , we will destroy them , " a group of soldiers tells me			1
in @entity1 the army comes first , no expense spared			1
while it shows off its guns to the world , many people go hungry			0
the military is well fed , but aid agencies say the country 's rural population suffers from chronic malnutrition and stunted growth as they scrounge for food			2
in a rare concession , @entity13 says this regime will not allow people to suffer any more -- as close as he could get to admitting the government had failed the people in the past			1
" our fellow citizens , who are the best citizens in the world , who have overcome countless struggles and hardships , it is our party 's firmest resolve not to let our citizens go hungry again , " he says			2
across the capital , people watching on are alive to this moment			0
when i approach one group and merely mention the name @entity13 they explode into chants and loud clapping			1
one man beaming at our camera says , " we want to tell the world how proud we are to have such a man to lead us			0
" @entity13 has inherited the power , adulation and responsibility few people could possibly be prepared for			1
the world is watching and wondering if he will be different from his forefathers and whether he will even survive			0
when the parade passes , @entity13 will face the reality of ruling this poverty - stricken , pariah state .			1

@entity13 spoke during a *celebration* in @entity0 marking @entity26 's birth 100 years earlier
the third generation of the @entity13 dynasty pledges to build on his family 's legacy
@entity13 also acknowledged the suffering of many @entity1 , vowed never to let them starve again
but he also carried a *warning* that @entity1 remains able to defend itself
