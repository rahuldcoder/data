-- like many of us , @entity1 knows what it 's like to forget his phone			2
from time to time , he leaves his cell phone in the office overnight , which can be irritating in this age of constant communication			1
" it was kind of a personal problem for me , " he said			0
" i tend to forget lots of things , and i thought i was n't the only person having this problem			0
" but now @entity1 has come up with what he says is a solution for those lapses : a small gadget called @entity23			1
the device , which will go on sale later this month , stays in a car 's power port and alerts its owners with a buzzing tone -- " brrring , brrring ! " -- if they 've left their phone behind			1
@entity23 joins a number of other devices and services that employ more technology to try to help tech - enabled people locate the gadgets they 've lost			1
@entity39 's @entity38 software and products called @entity41 and @entity42 are also trying to accomplish similar feats			0
some say that because mobile phones are getting relatively expensive , with smartphones retailing for hundreds of dollars , these emerging technologies are more useful or necessary for consumers			1
" these phones are n't cheap , and increasingly , our lives are tied to them , " said @entity49 , principal analyst at the @entity50 , a technology consulting firm			2
" without my cell phone , i 'm kind of lost , so leaving it behind is a significant problem for me			1
" @entity1 , who also founded @entity57 ( an internet video company whose clients include @entity60 , the parent company of @entity0 ) , was able to test his hypothesis that other people lost their phones often with a survey last summer			2
the company polled 205 consumers in office buildings and shopping malls in @entity70 and @entity71			2
they asked people in the unscientific survey how often they forgot their phones and how much they would pay to be able to stop leaving them behind			2
overall , 80 percent of those surveyed said that forgetting their phones was a problem			2
thirty percent said they would pay $ 29 or more to fix it			0
" we came back with these results that were quite startling to us , " said @entity1			0
" that 's when it was full steam ahead			0
" the benefits of each of these new phone - location products depend on the problem the user is trying to solve , @entity49 said			2
since @entity23 plugs into a cigarette lighter or power port , it works best for people who drive frequently			1
the small gadget pairs with your cell phone so that when you start your car , it starts searching for your phone 's @entity100 signal			1
if @entity23 detects it , it makes a short , " reassuring " noise and emits a blue light			1
but if you 've forgotten your phone , @entity23 , which retails for $ 35 , will flash red and sound a warning that reminds you to go back to get your phone			1
it 's a setup that works for @entity49 , who says he almost never misplaces his phone but often forgets to bring it with him			0
" my problem is that i always forget to pull it out of my charger in the morning and put it in my belt , " he said			0
if you need help finding your charger , too , there 's also a gadget for that : a category of @entity100 - enabled " phone leashes " can help users keep tabs on their phones			1
one , called @entity41 , combines @entity100 and gps technology to keep your phone or other items , including chargers , in a designated range			1
it can also track misplaced items to help you find them			1
" my wife has a habit of leaving the phone around and searching all over the house for it			0
on vibrate , it can be a real problem , " said @entity49			0
" if you have a habit of leaving things around the house , maybe go with phone @entity41			0
" phone @entity41 costs about $ 60			0
another phone tether , @entity42 , retails for slightly more , at about $ 80			0
users attach @entity42 to their key chains , and the device alerts them if their phone gets too far away from their present location			1
the gadgets may not be foolproof , though			0
@entity23 's @entity1 says the key chain alerts can result in " false alarms , " such as when you leave your keys in your jacket pocket while carrying your phone with you to a meeting			1
@entity23 is less of a leash and more like " taking attendance at school , " he said			1
like a teacher taking roll , it makes sure that your phone is present in your car			0
meanwhile , @entity23 likely wo n't work for people who take public transit or cabs instead of driving cars			1
a phone leash such as the phone @entity41 or @entity42 , for example , might have prevented @entity176 writer @entity175 from losing her @entity177 in a taxi cab about four months ago			1
but @entity23 would n't have worked in that situation			1
as it was , @entity180 did n't have any of these devices , so she had to buy a new phone for $ 500 , she says			0
after that , she decided to look into yet another way for people to track their phones -- a location - based software called @entity38			1
she purchased @entity38 account from @entity39 for $ 99 a year , and she download the companion " @entity177 " app. the program allows you to track the gps coordinates of an @entity177 after it has been stolen or lost			1
" it was one of those peace - of - mind issues , " said @entity180			0
" i think that once you go through the experience of losing your phone -- especially if you rely on it for a lot of your communications -- the need [ for a reminder device ] becomes a lot more clear			0
" some of the phone leashes have various additional features			0
@entity42 includes a speakerphone with a noise - canceling microphone and personal safety device			0
@entity209 , set to ship in august , will double as a cell phone charger			2
@entity211 is also working on expanding its catalog			0
some consumer electronics make life more complicated instead of simpler , but these phone reminders can reduce stress , according to @entity49			2
" leaving your cell phone behind can be everything from annoying to potentially catastrophic , " he added			2
" if you had an accident or had to call for help and left your phone behind , that 's when you would miss a device like this			2
" @entity180 points out that today 's users store more data on their phones			2
find my @entity177 allows users not only to track and locate their phone but to lock or remotely wipe the device			1
" when you lose [ your phone ] , it 's a really horrible experience -- not just when you have to replace it , but when it 's gone and you do n't know where it is , " said @entity180			0
" when you use it for everything , finding your phone becomes really important			0

@entity23 alerts its owners with a buzzing tone if they 've left their phone behind
find my @entity177 allows users to track the gps coordinates of their cell phones
some say more expensive cell phones make these aids more useful for consumers
