@entity0 , @entity1 -- within a year that saw a massive earthquake , a spreading cholera epidemic and recurring signs of government instability , the poorest country in the @entity9 is gearing up for its latest battle : presidential elections			1
nearly all of the 19 candidates have campaigned on similar platforms : fighting corruption , creating jobs and addressing a series of natural disasters that has left the @entity21 nation reeling and prompted many to urge for a postponement of sunday 's vote			1
@entity1 , which has endured near constant health and environmental crises , is facing a growing cholera epidemic affecting nearly 70,000 people that many fear could further scare voters from the polls			1
the death toll stands at 1,603 , the @entity32 and @entity33 reported friday			1
more than 29,000 people have been hospitalized , with a stunning 18.3 percent mortality rate in the country 's cholera - affected northeast , it said			1
but @entity41 , the @entity42 ambassador to @entity1 , said the election process was on track			2
he said 250,000 new voters were registered and more than 11,000 voting stations have been identified in the fifth presidential election since the fall of the @entity50 dictatorship and the first since the devastating 7.0 - magnitude earthquake in january			0
among the candidates is perhaps @entity1 's most flamboyant politician , @entity54 , who is perhaps better known by his street name : @entity54			1
@entity54 's penchant for dressing in drag and organizing raucous street parties in the @entity1 capital has made him a popular choice among portions of the electorate			2
" yes , i 've been the bad boy , " @entity54 told @entity2			0
" but the people of @entity1 believe in that rebel status that i 'm selling			2
you know , in able to fight the system , you must be strong , must be courageous			0
" his style clashes sharply with that of a more soft - spoken front - runner and former first lady , @entity73			0
the 70 - year - old conservatively dressed @entity74 stands to be @entity1 's first female president			1
her husband , @entity76 , was elected president in 1988 under the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) party but managed to hold on to the office only four months after his election			0
" it was a coup d'etat , " @entity73 told @entity2			0
" a military coup against him			0
and we had to go again in exile for two years			0
" @entity73 ran again in 2006 , losing to current outgoing president @entity87 in a controversial election in which @entity87 failed to secure more than 50 percent of the vote , but managed to avoid a mandatory runoff			1
in a country accustomed to political upheaval , angry crowds in the @entity1 capital last week tore down posters of @entity87 's hand - picked candidate , @entity96 , amid frustrations with the country 's corrupt and often ineffective leadership			1
@entity96 , whose well - funded campaign has occasionally featured airplanes dropping confetti , leads the largest bloc of politicians competing for seats in both houses of the @entity1 parliament			2
but with no clear front - runner , elections could be forced into a runoff in january if no candidate gains more than 50 percent of the vote			1
last week , days of violent protests brought @entity1 's second - largest city , @entity115 , to a standstill amid voter frustration about government corruption and the growing cholera outbreak			1
" there 's a history of some violence [ during @entity1 elections ] , " @entity121 spokesman @entity120 told @entity2			1
" some irregularities , some accusations of fraud , before , during and sometimes after the elections			0
" despite billions of dollars pledged by international donors , little has been done to clean up mountains of rubble or resettle the 1.3 million homeless people living in tents who have often suffered most from the spreading epidemic			2
meanwhile , the @entity137 said it was planning to treat 400,000 cholera cases within the next year , up from a previous estimate of 270,000 over several years , as a result of the outbreak			0
" we need to plan for up to half of those cases occurring in the next three months because of the explosive nature of this epidemic , " the organization 's deputy director , dr. @entity142 , told reporters in @entity145 on tuesday			0
" we need more of everything , " he said			0
" more training for staff in @entity1 , more doctors , more nurses , more treatment centers , more medications , more toilets , more clean water			0
" sunday 's election could be among the most important in recent history , as incoming lawmakers will grapple with campaign promises meant to address the country 's staggering range of problems .			2
