-- @entity2 presidential contender @entity1 defended her position on gay rights , the hpv vaccine and the debt ceiling as she made her debut on " @entity8 with @entity9			1
" @entity1 has more usually been the butt of @entity9 's jokes -- a point he made as he thanked her for being a good sport			1
" we 've done a million jokes			0
hopefully , you have n't been ... watching any of them , " he said , as she joined him on set			0
but @entity9 largely skipped the jokes friday as he quizzed the @entity23 congresswoman on her political positions			1
first up was the issue of the hpv vaccine , a subject on which @entity1 hit fellow @entity2 contender and @entity32 gov. @entity31 hard in this week 's @entity0 / @entity34 @entity33			1
@entity31 signed an executive order in 2007 that required @entity32 schoolgirls to receive vaccinations against the sexually transmitted hpv , although it was n't implemented			2
@entity1 told @entity9 that @entity31 's action had been " an abuse of executive power " and had sparked concern over " crony capitalism , " an apparent reference to the fact that a former @entity31 aide was a top lobbyist for @entity45 , the manufacturer for the hpv vaccine			1
@entity45 donated to @entity31 's campaign fund			2
she added : " the concern is that there 's , you know , potentially side effects that can come with something like that			0
but it gives a false sense of assurance to a young woman when she has that that if she 's sexually active that she does n't have to worry about sexually transmitted diseases			0
" @entity9 responded : " well , i do n't know if it gives assurance			2
it can prevent cervical cancer ; correct ? " he then pressed @entity1 over comments she made earlier this week in which she said a woman had approached the congresswoman to say her daughter had suffered " mental retardation " as a result of receiving the vaccination			2
there had been no recorded cases of such side effects despite 30 million people receiving the jab , @entity9 pointed out			0
" i was n't speaking as a doctor			0
i was n't speaking as a scientist			0
i was just relating what this woman said , " @entity1 replied			0
the former tax attorney and mother of five , who won the @entity84 straw poll last month but has seen her poll ratings slide since @entity31 entered the race , also defended two clinics she runs with her husband , offering what she said was a christian counseling service			1
the clinics have come under fire over claims they use a controversial therapy that encourages gay and lesbian patients to change their sexual orientation			0
asking @entity1 why gay people should n't have the right to be happily married , @entity9 said : " that whole ' pray the gay away ' thing , what ? i do n't get that			1
" @entity1 said the clinics did not discriminate , but repeated her position that marriage should be between a man and a woman			1
quizzed on her opposition to raising the debt ceiling , @entity1 said she would have taken the same position whether it had been president @entity112 or @entity113 in power			1
on @entity115 , @entity1 failed to answer whether she thought @entity117 forces should withdraw , but paid tribute to the " unbelievable job " done by @entity117 service men and women there			0
@entity9 's final question was whom @entity1 would pick as a running mate if she wins the @entity2 nomination , suggesting she might want someone more moderate to balance her views			1
she joked : " well , you 're taken			0
you do n't want a cut in pay , so what can i say ? " @entity9 replied : " well , we 'd probably have an argument over that gay thing			2

@entity1 *continues* her *criticism* of @entity31 over the hpv vaccine
@entity9 presses @entity1 on gay marriage and the counseling clinics she runs
the presidential hopeful says her opposition to raising the debt ceiling was not political
@entity1 declines to say who her running mate would be
