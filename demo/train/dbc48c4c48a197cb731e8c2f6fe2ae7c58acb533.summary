" another flag from the battle site was found months later in an @entity57 village seized by @entity20 troops and is now owned by the @entity59 , but @entity42 said it is in very poor condition			2
@entity5 's last battle was part of the @entity20 government 's 1876 - 77 campaign to retake the @entity67 region , ceded in perpetuity by an 1868 treaty to the @entity13			1

the @entity81 for the @entity82 acquired the flag in 1895 for $ 54 but has decided to part with it and use the proceeds for future art acquisitions			1

" the sale will help with future acquisitions , " said @entity87			0
" with the proceeds we will get art for the collection			0

" it 's pretty intact and given what it went through , it 's amazing			0
" @entity119 , chief historian at the @entity92 , said he believes the flag is stained with the blood of a fallen soldier and that the banner belongs to the @entity20 people			1
" it was an act of courage and bravery , " said @entity119 , a 20 - year veteran of the @entity59			0
" to lose the colors was really something that a soldier would give their lives [ to prevent ] , " he said			0
@entity119 is helping oversee events for the battle 's anniversary this weekend at the national monument , where visitors will hear symposiums and view re-enactments			0
he is hopeful that a benefactor will purchase the flag and loan it to a national museum			2
@entity42 said expectations are good that the @entity5 flag sale price might exceed @entity43 's $ 2 million to $ 5 million estimate , but the hope is that the sale will come close to the $ 12.3 million paid for a revolutionary battle flag in 2006 , a record for any military relic at auction .			1
