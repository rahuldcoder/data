-- first the good news			0
significant progress has been made over the past 13 years in meeting the targets the international community set for social and economic development by 2015			1
thanks to the collaborative efforts of government planning agencies , @entity10 entities , global aid organizations , international foundations and civil society groups , half a billion fewer people now live in extreme poverty , four out of five children routinely get vaccinated for a variety of diseases , and deaths from malaria have fallen by one quarter			1
family planning programs have helped slow population growth , contributing , in particular , to a significant reduction in fertility in the developing world			0
maternal death has been reduced , and we are now saving the lives of about 3 million children every year who previously would have died from childhood illnesses			0
we are also providing primary education for a record number of boys and girls in the developing world			0
read this : men , step up on family planning however , it 's clear that come 2015 , the world 's report card on the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) will be scored " @entity45			1
" and that 's not just because we are likely to fail to meet some of the targets we set for ourselves in the early days of the new century			0
( we have fallen short on our goals on maternal health and family planning , for example			0
) we will also get an " incomplete " because we are now facing challenges , like climate change , whose significance we failed to appreciate when the original goals were drafted			0
with that in mind , @entity10 secretary - general @entity58 appointed a @entity61 on the @entity62 to facilitate consultation with stakeholders ranging from member states to civil society , academia and individual citizens			0
as part of their work , the @entity61 produced discussion documents proposing basic principles for a new development framework			0
the @entity58 also appointed a @entity74 to outline a new set of goals designed to complete the work of the original @entity44 and address the new challenges of the century ahead			1
the @entity58 's vision for the new development framework centers on ending poverty through sustainable development , dealing with the problem of global climate change , and reducing inequality -- between men and women , and between rich and poor			1
the authors of this article , one of us the president of a developing nation and the other the head of the @entity94 , believe that @entity95 will be the test case for the world 's resolve and success , or failure , to achieve these goals			1
this is n't a case of parochialism , though we both happen to be @entity106			0
it is , instead , our shared judgment that @entity95 is likely to become the litmus test for whether the global community will have the resolve to work cooperatively to tackle the big issues that will affect us all on our increasingly interconnected and interdependent planet			1
the world has added approximately a billion people since the @entity10 drafted the @entity44 , and is expected to add approximately 3.7 billion more by 2100			1
significantly , @entity10 experts predict that almost all of that future growth will take place in developing nations , and that a disproportionate share of it will take place in @entity95			1
with this population growth will come increased demand for food , energy and water ; increased pressure on the natural environment ; increased demand for medical care ; and an increased need for education and jobs			0
in addition , the effects of climate change are expected to hit @entity95 particularly hard , exacerbating all of the challenges above			1
but the flipside of challenge is opportunity , and the opportunities in @entity95 are abundant			1
the 54 countries of @entity95 comprise , collectively , about 1 billion consumers with an average age of just under 20			2
this will represent an enormous market for the world 's goods and services in the decades ahead			0
@entity154 : new wind of change is blowing through @entity95 by mid-century , @entity106 will also represent one quarter of the global labor force , and by the end of the century , @entity95 will have the world 's highest ratio of working age population to dependents			2
this is a giant potential " demographic dividend " that @entity95 can build upon			2
with far - sightedness , @entity106 countries can also tap the enormous potential of @entity106 women and girls			0
educating women , providing age - appropriate sex education and access to family planning methods , will free and empower women and girls to make even more significant contributions to @entity95 's economic development			1
in many ways , the " face " of @entity95 's future is the face of a teenage girl			2
@entity95 's economy will also continue to benefit from the continent 's enormous mineral wealth , which , if managed sustainably and equitably , should fuel accelerated economic growth in the decades ahead			2
the continent 's potential for growth is also underscored by the fact that @entity95 has the world 's largest share of underutilized arable land and water			2
the opportunities are extraordinary , the challenges many			0
as the @entity10 drafts a new set of goals to follow the @entity44 , @entity95 will be the ultimate testing ground for new strategies to end poverty , mitigate the impact of climate change and reduce inequality in the 21st century			1
however , if @entity95 gets it " right , " the continent will also be the new century 's greatest success story			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of president @entity209 and dr. @entity210 .			1

@entity213 president @entity209 and @entity94 chief write on development goals
international community made progress on @entity44 , but still has a way to go , they say
extreme poverty and vaccinations for children have seen an *improvement*
@entity95 will be testing ground for new strategies to reduce inequality
