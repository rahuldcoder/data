" are you open yet ? " a passerby asked			0
it was 10 a.m. on a sunny fall day here , where a small group of staffers met a @entity8 camera crew outside of @entity9			0
by the time the doors officially opened two hours later , a handful of others had inquired about when they could get a scoop			0
the people wanted their ice cream			1
you see , this is not your typical ice cream parlor			1
" here at @entity22 we actually make every single batch of ice cream to order , " explained store founder @entity20			1
" so nothing is frozen until you order it , and we make everything from scratch that morning			2
" using seasonal and local ingredients , @entity20 's team creates creative flavors like cinnamon apple crisp , maple brown sugar squash and meyer lemon gingersnap			0
@entity22 does n't use preservatives , emulsifiers or stabilizers in any of its ingredients			2
and because its creations are frozen before your eyes in seconds , the process involves some serious science			0
" we do get super nerdy about our ice cream and we get nerdy because we think it makes a better product , " said @entity20			1
no wonder vogue called @entity22 , " arguably the freshest , if not the best , ice cream on earth			1
" after a few years in the corporate world and attending the @entity54 , @entity20 decided to follow a childhood dream			0
" my mom used to tell me that i had two stomachs and one of those was solely reserved for ice cream , " @entity20 said			1
so the little girl with the big appetite invested her life savings , teamed up with some engineers and spent five years prototyping ice cream machines in her backyard			1
the final product was a high - tech , patented mixer called a @entity70 machine			1
those who serve the silky smooth ice cream at @entity73 are aptly named , @entity74			2
each order takes about 90 seconds to make and many customers took full advantage of that wait by snapping pictures and videos of the @entity81 machine in action			1
brrristas pour in organic cream along with other ingredients and set the @entity81 in motion			0
it whirrs and spins and the mixing bowls become surrounded by a fog of evaporating liquid nitrogen			0
" we use nitrogen because it 's super , super cold			1
it 's actually negative 321 degrees @entity94 , " explained @entity20 , " and a super , super cold freezing process actually has the ability to make a smaller ice crystal , and a smaller ice crystal means a really , really smooth product			1
" one of three different patents for the brr machine is a double - helical beater that 's designed to scrape every surface of itself and every surface of the bowl to develop the tiny ice crystals			2
it also has " smart " software that 's programmed to know when the ice cream is ready to be served			1
" a smaller ice crystal makes a smoother , more luscious texture , " said @entity20 , " so our ice cream is actually a lot creamier than other ice cream in addition to being a lot more fresh			2
" but before the brick - and - mortar store and the frenzy of foodie fans , @entity20 had to hit the streets to dish out her treats			0
she rigged up a @entity123 wagon with a battery pack to power the @entity125 and tweeted her location for the day			0
" i was totally broke and that 's why the only thing i could do was sell ice cream out of a @entity123 wagon -- which was a super amazing way to learn about what people wanted , " said @entity20			1
" i tested a bunch of different flavors and i already had teamed up with our amazing chef , @entity135 , and so she made a different flavor every day			0
i 'd pick it out at her house and go into the street			0
" the combination of fresh ingredients , the magic of the mixer , and word - of - mouth proved to be a winning combination			0
" this past summer we served over 20,000 people a month out of this tiny little 320 - square - foot shop , so that 's a pretty good number for us , " @entity20 said			2
@entity22 plans to open up three new locations in the @entity153 area within the next year			2
" we 're keeping it local , but we 're going to be spreading the @entity73 love , " @entity20 said .			0

a high - tech mixer , called a @entity70 machine , can make ice cream from scratch in 90 seconds
machine is behind the *success* of @entity22 , a @entity153 - based ice cream shop
