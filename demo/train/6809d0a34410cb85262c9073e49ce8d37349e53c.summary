-- a story this week by the @entity2 has caused quite a stir , especially among african - americans , when multiple news outlets ran it with the attention - grabbing headline , " some black pastors are telling their flocks to stay home @entity10			1
" the @entity12 ran the story , along with the @entity14 , @entity15 , and a host of conservative websites such as @entity18 and @entity19			2
when i first saw the headline , i was stunned , especially knowing the blood that has been shed over the years by african - americans and others to gain the precious right to vote			2
i read the more than 1,300 - word story by @entity27 , with a contribution from @entity29			0
the first line was " some black clergy see no good presidential choice between a @entity34 candidate and one who supports gay marriage , so they are telling their flocks to stay home on @entity10			1
" nothing in the story legitimately backed up that first line			0
anybody who had read the full article would know that			0
in reading the piece , @entity27 and @entity45 quote or mention pastors @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity51 - @entity50 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
politics : is @entity56 taking black vote for granted ? not a single one of these pastors was quoted as saying they have or plan to tell their congregations not to vote in the presidential election			1
several expressed misgivings about president @entity56 's support for same - sex marriage , and others had negative thoughts about @entity69 being a @entity34 or the effect of his policies on their congregants			1
one said he has n't decided whom he will vote for , and @entity53 said he 'll go fishing on @entity10			1
but not a one said they were telling their members not to vote			0
the only time this assertion that pastors are telling their congregations to stay home comes from a quote , lifted from another newspaper			1
the story quotes @entity47 as telling the @entity85 , " this is the first time in black church history that i 'm aware of that black pastors have encouraged their parishioners not to vote			1
" the reporters could n't reach him to ask him about it , but going ahead and using the quote is suspect			0
the writers provide no specifics , no context , or anything else			0
@entity47 said he was aware of this , not that he knew anyone			0
this is third - hand reporting			0
unless you as a reporter know of specific pastors telling their congregations not to vote , it 's wrong to make the assumption			1
@entity47 even tweeted the @entity2 after the story ran : " when did you contact @ jamalhbryant in order to get his statement on voting ? you need to revisit this & be accurate			1
" pastors recommending that their followers stay home on @entity10 would be jeopardizing their 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status with the @entity117			1
a pastor can say whom he or she is personally supporting , but directing their congregations not to vote for a candidate would be a violation of federal law			2
so these news outlets that ran the story could not have read the piece			0
if they did , they need to explain to their readers why they ran it			0
when contacted about this story , the @entity2 said it " stands by the version of the story that we distributed , separate and apart from versions that deviated from our own text			1
" but i believe @entity2 should thoroughly examine its internal controls because that story has other fundamental problems			2
it is clear that @entity27 and @entity29 chose to ignore compelling data that undercuts the article 's general thesis			2
if you look at any polling data , it is clear that african - americans overwhelmingly are going to vote for @entity56			0
one recent poll says he will get 94 % of the black vote			2
surely , there are black @entity154 among that particular group			0
can @entity2 explain why this recent polling was missing from this story ? surely the facts could put their story in perspective			2
second , the @entity56 campaign has an extensive faith - based outreach among @entity165 pastors , and the president has participated in conference calls with them , including one on the day he announced his support for same - sex marriage			1
political ticker : black pastors group launches @entity175 campaign around gay marriage why did n't @entity27 or @entity29 make mention of that or try to reach out to them ? that 's @entity181 101			1
last , it 's nonsensical to quote several black pastors who have misgivings about positions taken by @entity56 and @entity69 and conclude that " african - american @entity154 waver over vote , " as the first headline provided by @entity2 said			1
no , maybe those individuals are wavering , but the evidence is clear that a super-majority of african - americans , including @entity154 , are clear as to which candidate they are voting for in november			0
there is no denying that @entity56 's same - sex marriage position caused tremendous discussion in the black community , and i have heard from a handful of folks who say that has changed their view of him and dampened their enthusiasm to support him for a second term			1
but i would never offer up a sweeping claim that it is as widespread as @entity27 and @entity29 suggest			0
some would say this is internal journalism stuff			0
this story has led to editorials blasting black pastors ; caused some mentioned in the article to feel obliged to come out and state who they will endorse ; and has led to consternation among the general public			1
our job in the media is to inform and enlighten , not confuse			0
running such a confusing , unsupported story lacking basic context and perspective does not serve the public at all			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity2 article caused consternation by asserting black pastors urging flocks not to vote
@entity229 says story did not back that up with real evidence or context
@entity229 : no pastor quoted in the story said he told congregants to stay home on @entity10
@entity229 : president 's gay marriage stance is of concern , but vast majority of blacks support him
