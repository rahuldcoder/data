-- on friday , @entity1 stopped a concert in @entity3 to demand that everyone stand up			1
he looked around the crowd , pointing out those slow to rise			2
he said , " unless you got a handicap pass and you get special parking and s * * t , " he simply would not continue the show until everyone was on their feet			0
the crowd shouted , " stand up ! " or even , " f * * * ing stand up ! " after a minute , @entity1 pointed out two people who , he said , " do n't want to stand up			1
" one of them waved a prosthetic leg in the air , so @entity1 turned to the last holdout			1
he demanded to know if the fan was in a wheelchair			0
he complained , " this is the longest i 've had to wait to do a song , it 's unbelievable			1
" finally , as the crowd was shouting that the fan was in a wheelchair , @entity1 sent a bodyguard to verify it , then finally started his song , " @entity31			1
" reaction to this incident throughout social media and in numerous publications was swift and condemnatory			0
@entity1 , in return , lashed out at the media			1
but in fact , although @entity1 's celebrity magnifies the story , the bigger issue here is that his demand that his fans prove their disability is entirely typical			1
every day , in every context , people with disabilities get challenged to prove how disabled they are			1
this constant questioning isolates people with disabilities , increases stress and shame , and can lead directly to verbal or even physical abuse			1
here are a few examples : a few weeks ago , actor @entity55 shared a meme showing a woman standing up from a wheelchair at a grocery store to reach a liquor bottle			0
the caption , " there has been a miracle in the alcohol isle , " suggested that this woman was n't really that disabled if she could stand up to get some booze			2
disability advocates protested and @entity55 initially told them to lighten up , but he has subsequently apologized			0
i was alerted to the story by a woman who can walk about 100 feet before needing her chair , and who goes through life worried about being accused of faking			0
the parking lot , with its handicapped spots , can be particularly fraught for people with invisible disabilities			2
on my @entity81 page , one of my readers remarked that , " all i see are looks of disapproval , barely veiled disgust and constant scrutiny			0
i 'd gladly trade my ' good ' parking space for being able to walk more than 25 yards at a time			0
" who knows how many people with invisible disabilities , managing pain , enjoying the concert , were forced to their feet by the glare of @entity1 and the peer pressure of the shouting crowd ? invisible disability also gets people in trouble with the law			1
when a disabled person does n't react the way a law enforcement officer thinks he or she should , violence often follows			2
but visible disability is no protection			0
in 2008 , as shown in a disturbing video , a @entity107 deputy did n't believe a man who had been arrested on a traffic violation was really a quadriplegic , so she dumped him onto the floor to see if he would use his legs out of duress			2
these are just a few of the ways we constantly demand that people with disabilities prove themselves			1
we do it because , to the not - disabled , claiming disability seems to have a kind of power			0
thanks to the @entity124 , to claim disability is to ask for reasonable accommodation -- accessible buildings , more time on tests , audible formats for books , social security disability payments , and more			0
too many people seem to regard the request to accommodate as a burden and meet such requests with suspicion			2
the not - disabled exercise their privilege by demanding that people prove their disabilities ; then , all too often , proof just generates pity , not understanding or inclusion			1
by demanding everyone rise , by calling out the disabled members of his audience even as he grudgingly tolerated their inability to stand , @entity1 was being totally normal			1
if you think what he did was wrong , remember that the next time you are tempted to stare down someone walking from a handicapped spot at the grocery store			0
remember that the next time someone managing pain ca n't make it into work			2
remember that the next time a student needs a little more time on a test			0
because the problem is n't that @entity1 was so thoughtless , although he was			1
the problem is that he learned this thoughtlessness from us .			0

@entity1 *insisted* audience members stand before he would sing song in @entity166 concert
he relented when those who did n't stand turned out to have disabilities
@entity171 says it 's not at all *unusual* for people to be asked to prove their disabilities
@entity171 : do n't blame just @entity1 for conduct that many of us *routinely* engage in
