-- @entity1 , a nurse who worked with @entity2 to treat @entity4 patients in @entity5 , was placed under mandatory quarantine in @entity7 for three days even though she tested negative for @entity4 and is asymptomatic			1
after much protest , she was finally released on monday			1
in her opinion , her " basic human rights have been violated			0
" she appeared on @entity0 and criticized politicians ' reactions to @entity4 and the lack of forethought and plan			1
this newest quarantine has us wondering again how far the government can restrain individuals for the common good			0
no doubt , being physically confined by the government feels like a fundamental violation			1
but it 's rarely a legal violation			1
for over a hundred years , the @entity26 and other tribunals have upheld the right of states to enact compulsory laws related to health care issues such as vaccination			2
the seminal case , @entity34 , recognized " manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good			0
" so how far does this power to regulate for the public health go ? consider the infamous 1927 case of @entity41 -- a cautionary tale for all medical students -- in which the court upheld a state 's involuntary sterilization of " feebleminded " persons in state institutions			1
the court broadened state power drastically to allow forcing unwanted surgery on a female for the express purpose of neutering her			1
perhaps most shocking to modern sensibilities was the court 's use of the @entity59 logic of contagious diseases			1
justice @entity61 stated in a judicial opinion that the " principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes " to avoid further generations of " imbeciles			0
the @entity26 actually said that			0
since then , the court has specifically recognized that the general health and welfare of the public may require adults be dealt with by compulsory treatment including quarantine , confinement or sequestration			1
along with many other cases echoing similar sentiments , little doubt remains about the matter			0
state governments have historically enjoyed nearly unfettered power to restrain our liberty in the name of public health			1
these cases were decided in times when crowded urban conditions , less - advanced medicine , and lack of public education required drastic measures to avoid the scourge of disease infection			2
but times have changed , and the collective views of citizens and governments today bear little resemblance to those of centuries past			0
thanks to the dizzying advances in medical sciences and education , the citizen - patient is more informed and empowered			0
of course , the unintended side effect of patient autonomy is overreaction			0
in researching rashes on @entity114 , a simple poison ivy may become the bubonic plague in the minds of some			0
while the internet unquestionably contributes to quicker and bigger waves of panic , make no mistake -- the connectivity of communication is a boon to , as well as bane of , public health			1
for example , most of us are aware on some level of the individual right to refuse medical treatment			0
and most of us have a general understanding of the right to privacy preventing undue interference with a woman 's " right to choose " abortion			2
the court cases that protect these liberties may leave the public with a strong and perhaps unrealistic impression about what constitute unassailable , bedrock " rights			2
" however , these are actually narrowly defined liberties that affect only one patient 's life ( and , depending on your view of abortion , the life of a fetus )			2
by contrast , it appears little has changed in the jurisprudence of outbreaks and communicable diseases			2
the courts continue to recognize the government 's broad " police power " to legislate for its citizens ' health , safety and morals			2
but state authority is not without limit			2
states seeking to take your personal liberty with a quarantine must establish necessity , reasonable means , proportionality , and seek to avoid harm			1
what those concepts actually mean is surely a case - by - case analysis , because it 's impossible to know what 's reasonable until a medical expert tells us what 's reasonable			0
@entity1 's allegation , for example , was that there was no intelligible plan , and therefore no reasonable tailoring of the government intrusion into her liberty			1
she may be right if the medical evidence supports her view			0
still , it 's an uphill battle for the nurse - as - plaintiff			0
it 's exceedingly difficult to sue state agencies to begin with			2
moreover , courts have upheld compulsory measures on numerous occasions involving vaccinations or quarantines , and even jailing those with serious cases of tuberculosis			0
ultimately , other than reproductive freedoms and end - of - life decisions , courts have not recognized a fundamental " freedom of the body			0
" what undoubtedly feels to @entity1 like a violation of " basic human rights " may not automatically be the same as the " fundamental rights " closely guarded and scrutinized by the @entity26			1
when it comes to infectious diseases , the collective jurisprudential message is as clear today as it was in centuries past : public health concerns can warrant the state 's intrusion on personal freedoms			1
the individual 's liberty can still theoretically outweigh public safety , but practically , you 're talking about convincing a court that your right to walk to the corner store outweighs the risk of an epidemic			1
better fire up the @entity234 and @entity235 , and get comfortable with a couple weeks ' house arrest .			0

@entity1 , who tested negative for @entity4 but was quarantined , was finally released
@entity239 : being confined feels like a violation , but it 's rarely a legal violation
he says when it comes to infectious diseases , the court is not taking any chances
@entity239 : public health concerns can warrant the state 's intrusion on personal liberty
