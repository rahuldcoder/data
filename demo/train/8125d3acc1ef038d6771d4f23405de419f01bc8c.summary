@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 has not been vigilant enough or fast enough in responding to the problem of sexual abuse by priests , pope @entity3 said thursday			1
" these revelations were for me a shock and a great sadness			1
it is difficult to understand how this perversion of the priestly ministry was possible , " he told reporters aboard his plane to @entity1			1
" how a man who has done this and said this can fall into this perversion is difficult to understand			1
" he added , " it is also a great sadness that the authorities of the church were not sufficiently vigilant and insufficiently quick and decisive in taking the necessary measures			1
" @entity26 people feel overwhelmingly that the pope has not done enough to punish priests who abuse children , according to a @entity31 poll for @entity2 released as @entity3 arrived in the country			1
three out of four @entity26 people -- and two out of three @entity4 in the country -- say he should do more to punish abusive clergy			2
critics of the church were quick to pounce on the pope 's remarks			1
" it 's disingenuous to say church officials have been slow and insufficiently vigilant in dealing with clergy sex crimes and cover ups			1
on the contrary , they 've been prompt and vigilant , but in concealing , not preventing , these horrors , " said @entity46 of @entity47 , the @entity47			1
another campaigner took aim at the pontiff personally			2
" the pope affects the stance of a shocked bystander , when in fact he has been for decades the church 's central handler of sex abuse cases , " said @entity52 of @entity53 , a group that tracks reports of abuse by priests			1
the pope made the comments as he arrived for a historic four - day state visit to @entity26 , where the issue of abuse , and the @entity68 's perceived lack of response to it , has created anger			1
but there was a warm welcome for him on a cold afternoon in @entity0 , @entity1 , for the first major mass of his visit			1
tens of thousands turned out to hear him preach , with members of the faithful describing it as a " happy day " and calling it a " great honor " that he had come			0
@entity3 elaborated in @entity0 on what 's expected to be a major theme of his visit , the value of religion in a society that he sees as increasingly secular			0
" there are some who now seek to exclude religious belief from public discourse , to privatize it or even to paint it as a threat to equality and liberty , " he said in his homily			0
" yet religion is in fact a guarantee of authentic liberty and respect			0
" he also urged bishops to look after their priests -- possibly an oblique reference to the sex abuse scandal -- and warned young people against the temptations of " drugs , money , sex , pornography , alcohol -- which the world tells you will bring you happiness , yet these things are destructive and divisive			2
" @entity3 started his visit in @entity119 , where he held a meeting with the queen and greeted thousands who turned out to see him on the streets of the @entity1 city			1
@entity125 shook hands with the pope at her @entity1 residence near @entity119 , the @entity129 , before they sat down for a private meeting			1
a military marching band played the national anthem @entity133 , for which the pope removed his white cap			2
the pope used relatively strong language in a speech delivered after the meeting , reflecting on the " sobering lessons of the atheist extremism " of the 20th century			2
he reminded the media of its " greater responsibility than most " to promote peace and the spread of human rights , and he reminded the country of its " deep @entity147 roots " that he said are still present in " every layer " of @entity26 life			0
" today , the @entity26 strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " the pope said			2
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate			0
let it not obscure the @entity147 foundation that underpins its freedoms			0
" those comments , too , resulted in " disappointment " from the @entity168 , which said the notion that atheism " somehow fuels intolerance in @entity26 today is a terrible libel against those who do not believe in @entity171			2
" the @entity175 said @entity26 secularism " is not something to criticize , but to celebrate			0
" " we have rejected dogmatic religion devoid of compassion , " the group said in a statement			0
" in its place we have embraced and included gay people and given them the right to full equality , given women the right to control their own fertility , given scientists a free hand to seek cures for horrific diseases by the use of stem - cell research			0
" though a pope has visited @entity26 once before -- pope @entity198 in 1982 -- this is considered the first state visit by a pope to @entity26 because it comes at the invitation of the queen , not the @entity4 , as was the case 28 years ago			2
@entity3 's september 16 - 19 trip is scheduled to include meetings with political leaders , royalty , and bridge - building events with @entity211 officials			0
it will culminate in the beatification of @entity26 cardinal @entity214 , a @entity4 convert who died in 1890 and is credited with helping rebuild @entity26 's @entity4 community			0
assistant chief constable @entity217 , of @entity1 's @entity218 , said earlier this week that she estimated only 65,000 pilgrims would attend the @entity220 there , short of an initially anticipated 100,000			1
there has already been widespread outcry over the estimated 12 million pounds ( $ 18.7 million ) @entity26 taxpayers are having to pay for the visit , though @entity226 , the prime minister 's representative for the papal visit , has pointed out that one day of last year 's @entity230 summit in @entity231 cost 20 million pounds			0
criticism has also focused on the armed police squads needed to protect a religious figurehead previously targeted by attackers			0
along with anger about the @entity68 's response to child and sexual abuse , there is criticism over the pope being granted a state visit , given the @entity4 's attitudes towards gender equality and homosexuality			1
@entity4 leaders and government officials have defended the trip , with prime minister @entity250 saying @entity26 and the @entity68 have " incredibly important work to do together " in promoting a " multi-faith dialogue			0
" @entity2 's @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
