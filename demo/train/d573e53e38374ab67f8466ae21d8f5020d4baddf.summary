-- with no way to counter toxic jellyfish that brought intense pain and partial paralysis during an attempted 103 - mile ocean crossing from @entity7 to @entity8 , endurance swimmer @entity1 said monday that she will not make another attempt at the feat. " i ca n't beat those guys			1
they 're too much for me , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 , 62 , swam 82 nautical miles of the 103 - mile crossing before two stings from what her team identified as potentially lethal box jellyfish forced her out of the water sunday morning			1
in a frequently emotional news conference in which she removed her shirt to reveal sting marks , @entity1 said she initially planned to muscle through the intense pain			1
but she said she eventually had to give up as the toxins began to cause partial paralysis and made it increasingly difficult for her to breathe			0
what 's a @entity29 man - of - war ? @entity1 still had a wheeze monday , said one of her doctors , @entity31 of the @entity33			1
toxins from the stings also affected members of her crew trying to help her			0
" this was a life - threatening situation we were in , " @entity31 said			2
@entity1 stopped the swim sunday morning after 40 hours in the water			1
" it 's not easy for me to let go of this dream , and i 'm in distress about it , " she said			1
she said it was " naive " of her not to anticipate problems from the jellyfish , which she said are proliferating throughout the world 's oceans because of climate change			2
unlike sharks , which her team countered with divers and electronic devices , no good tools exist to fend off jellyfish , @entity1 said			1
she said she knows she could complete the crossing were it not for the creatures			2
she said the last two years of training were not wasted			0
" it 's been a grand , elevating , life - confirming experience these last two years , " she said			2
@entity1 began her attempt friday evening from @entity67 's @entity66 , expecting to spend about 60 hours in the water			1
it was her third attempt to complete the swim			0
her first , in 1978 , was brought to an end by strong currents and bad weather after almost 42 hours in the water			0
she made a second try in august , but she was pulled from the water after 60 miles and almost 29 hours of swimming			0
she blamed a shoulder injury she suffered early in the journey and an 11 - hour - long asthma attack			0
she said people inspired by her efforts should continue to train their bodies , test their wills and dream big			0
and , said said , not being able finish the crossing against such odds was no sign of failure , for her or her team			0
" there 's so much boldness in living life this way , and we did it all , and no one can take it away from us , " she said .			0
