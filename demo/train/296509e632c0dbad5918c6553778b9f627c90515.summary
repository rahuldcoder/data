-- answers have been elusive on what may have contributed to the february 15 , 2011 , ambush that killed a @entity5 agent and injured another while on assignment in @entity8			1
was @entity11 agent @entity10 's death due in part to negligence by his supervisors ? do the @entity5 gun shops that sold the weapons used in the attack share some responsibility ? what about the armored vehicle company whose suv failed to protect the agents ? now , the family of the slain agent , in a $ 75 million lawsuit filed tuesday , alleges that all these and more were responsible for @entity10 's death			1
the court docket originally listed a $ 75 billion demand , but was amended on thursday			1
a second immigration agent , @entity31 , was wounded when he and @entity10 were ambushed on a highway in @entity33			1
the two were traveling to @entity35 in an armored car with diplomatic plates			0
they were run off the road and attacked from two vehicles by gunmen who fired indiscriminately , @entity8 authorities said			0
@entity31 is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit			1
the lawsuit names more than 20 defendants , including the @entity5 government , the straw purchasers who acquired the weapons used , and the federal firearms officials who oversaw the flawed " @entity53 " operation aimed at tracking the flow of weapons across the @entity5 - @entity8 border			1
some people , including sen. @entity55 of @entity56 , have asked whether a " gun - walking " program similar to @entity53 played a role in @entity10 's killing			1
is @entity8 becoming the new @entity60 for @entity5 agents ? the lawsuit alleges that as early as 2010 , the @entity65 had identified brothers @entity66 and @entity68 and @entity69 as straw purchasers for @entity8 cartels , but did not act to stop them from purchasing more weapons , a pair of which ultimately found their way to the crime scene in @entity8			1
" @entity65 had an opportunity and probable cause to arrest the @entity68 brothers and @entity69 but failed to do so , " the lawsuit states			1
it names the departments of @entity82 and @entity83 , as well as the supervisors of @entity53 , as the group that developed the strategy of letting guns " walk " that was allegedly also used in @entity56			0
the government " placed weapons in the hands of a dangerous criminal organization and failed to warn , thereby placing agents @entity10 and @entity31 in harm 's way , " according to the lawsuit			1
tuesday 's filing follows a similar lawsuit filed two months ago by the family of slain @entity99 agent @entity99			1
his killing in @entity102 , near the @entity8 border , brought the strategy of gun walking to light			0
@entity99 's family sued federal officials and the owner of a gun shop			1
the @entity10 suit goes further , blaming the agents ' supervisors for sending them on the risky trip to pick up a package			0
the @entity5 @entity117 in @entity8 had issued a warning to avoid driving in certain regions , and there were other options for delivering the package , the lawsuit states			2
" despite opposition by @entity31 and despite having full knowledge of the dangers present with the package pick - up , ( the supervisors ) instructed @entity31 and @entity10 to proceed with the directive , " the court document states			2
the company that built the armored @entity131 that the agents were in also shares responsibility for " faulty safety features " on the vehicle , the lawsuit alleges			2
after @entity10 was forced to pull over after being boxed in by his assailants , he placed the vehicle in " park , " which automatically unlocked the doors , creating the opportunity the attackers needed to breach the vehicle , it says			0
finally , the lawsuit says the gun sellers should have been aware of false statements made by the straw buyers whose gun purchases ended up in @entity8			2
" all of these illegal firearm purchases occurred under extremely suspicious circumstances , " according to the lawsuit			2
one of the gun sellers named in the suit , @entity151 's @entity150 in @entity152 , @entity56 , says it did nothing illegal			0
the president of the pawn shop , @entity157 , said he was not aware of the lawsuit , but remembers the gun purchase in question			2
the @entity65 and @entity161 both went through the buyer 's paperwork and approved the sale , he said			0
the @entity11 agency continues to mourn @entity10 's loss and honors his sacrifice , but it does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy , spokeswoman @entity165 said			0
responses were not immediately available from the other named defendants			0
one of the suspects in @entity10 's killing , @entity176 , also known as " @entity177 , " was arrested in @entity8 and extradited to the @entity5 in late 2011			0
he is charged in a four - count indictment with murdering an officer or employee of the @entity5 ; one count of attempted murder of an officer of employees of the @entity5 ; one count of attempted murder of an internationally protected person ; and one count of using , carrying , brandishing and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence causing death			0
@entity176 pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial .			0

new : the court docket is amended to state that the lawsuit is for $ 75 million
the family of a slain immigration agent is suing the government and many others
an agent who survived the attack in @entity33 is also a plaintiff
the lawsuit calls a number of people negligent in *decisions* leading to the 2011 attack
