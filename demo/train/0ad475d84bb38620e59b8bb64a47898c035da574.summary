@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has never been accused of wanting for opinions , but the former @entity1 leader 's tuesday commentary stumped many of his fellow citizens			1
the subject was not the bloodshed in @entity11 or the economic crisis in @entity13 , but yoga			0
yoga ? " yoga does things with the human body that defy the imagination , " @entity3 wrote in a front - page editorial in the island 's state - run @entity18 newspaper			1
the 35 - word ode to the @entity26 art of meditation and stretching was the latest " reflection from comrade @entity3 , " a newspaper column dedicated to @entity3 's musings that has appeared regularly since he stepped down from power in 2006 due to a mystery illness			1
@entity3 's praising of yoga , which according to @entity18 , occurred at 2:40 p.m. on monday , did not include whether @entity3 himself was a practitioner			1
the column was atypically short for the famously verbose former head of state			0
opinion : is @entity41 's @entity40 ? since his illness , @entity3 's " reflection " opinion pieces often have filled whole pages in the newspaper -- not a difficult task for a world leader who in his heyday spoke for hours without notes on a variety of subjects			1
but in recent weeks , @entity3 's published opinions resemble microburst streams of consciousness more akin to a @entity57 message than a formal treatise			2
" he thought of himself as a wise man and , doubtless , he was			0
but he made a small mistake , " @entity3 wrote friday about an apparent long - ago rift with former @entity62 leader @entity61			1
" @entity1 has to be punished , " @entity3 wrote that @entity61 said			1
" our country never even pronounced his name			0
" @entity61 died in 1997 and it is not clear what punishment @entity3 referred to			2
another " reflection " praised former @entity71 leader @entity70 , who @entity3 wrote was the " most revolutionary @entity71 i have known			1
" " i had the privilege of observing his conduct , " @entity3 continued in the brief column			0
" when he was paying bitterly for the debt contracted by the man who sold his soul to the devil for a few shots of vodka			0
" " the man " selling his soul for vodka was not identified , sparking a debate among @entity1 , some thinking @entity3 meant former @entity85 president @entity84 , a reputed lover of the beverage			0
others argued he meant former @entity92 leader @entity91 , whose reforms helped lead to the end of the @entity92 empire and to vital economic aid from the @entity92 to @entity1			0
@entity98 's daughter endorses @entity99 for his monday " reflection , " @entity3 switched topics from politics to farming , authoring a one - sentence endorsement of the moringa olefeira and mulberry plants for their nutritional benefits			1
the brief and sometimes cryptic " reflections " have also stirred debate in @entity110 , where @entity3 's health is an oft - discussed topic among the city 's large @entity1 - @entity114 community			2
@entity3 has not been seen publicly since march , when video was shown of him meeting with pope @entity118 during the pontiff 's visit to @entity1			2
in the video , @entity3 appeared frail and had to be assisted while he walked			0
" it may be that he is not coherent enough to write longer ' reflections , ' " said professor @entity122 of the @entity123			0
" but it 's clear even if @entity3 is no longer in the limelight , he is not ready to stop talking just yet			2

since his illness , @entity3 has written regular " reflection " newspaper commentaries
his topics have ranged from former leaders to plants
tuesday 's topic : yoga
