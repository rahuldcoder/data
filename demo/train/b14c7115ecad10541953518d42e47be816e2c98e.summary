@entity0 -- promoters yanked the rock band @entity3 from the @entity6 tribute show tuesday after fans called their attention to negative remarks @entity3 leader @entity10 made about the pop star in the weeks after his death			1
the reversals came a day after @entity14 appeared live on @entity1 to announce the addition of @entity3 to the lineup for " @entity17 : the @entity18 , " scheduled for october 8 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
" we have listened to @entity17 's fans and are grateful to have been alerted to these unfortunate statements by @entity10 , " @entity22 ceo @entity21 told @entity1 tuesday			1
fan clubs appeared in open revolt against the tribute show after promoters added the group			2
fan websites pointed to published interviews in which @entity10 spoke about his suspicions that @entity6 , who was acquitted of child molestation in 2005 , was a pedophile			1
the executors of the @entity6 estate also spoke out late monday , sending a letter to the promoters saying they were " especially disappointed " by the announcement that @entity3 was in the show			1
the estate asked promoters to provide an explanation			0
" as i am sure you are aware , mr. @entity10 has made numerous disparaging public comments about @entity6 after his passing , " estate lawyer @entity43 wrote in the letter obtained by @entity1			1
he called media coverage of the controversy " extraordinarily embarrassing			0
" the estate , which has not sanctioned the event , also questioned the promoters ' promise to share profits with charities and a provision in the terms of the ticket sale that so long as 50 % of the billed acts show up there would be no refunds ,			0
" it is a concern to us that loyal @entity6 fans will pay for tickets and not receive full benefit for their purchase , nor will they be able to get a full refund if certain artists they paid to see cancel their participation , " the letter said			2
the promoters replied tuesday morning			0
" under the circumstances we fully agree that even though @entity3 is a band @entity17 admired , we have no choice but to rescind our invitation to them to appear in our tribute concert , " @entity21 said			1
promoters , who had hoped the addition of the legendary group would bolster their lineup , said they were unaware of @entity10 ' statements when they booked @entity3 for the show			1
" we offer our sincerest apologies to @entity14 and the family for this oversight			0
our primary concern must be to do justice to @entity17 's memory , and to put on a tribute that the family and the fans will find suitable and fit for a @entity6 , our @entity6 , " @entity21 said			1
@entity10 ' comments were well - known among many @entity6 fans			1
fan websites quickly posted scathing objections after monday 's announcement			2
" in the days following @entity6 's death , @entity10 has made slanderous , derogatory comments about @entity17 and his children , " the fan site united for @entity6 's @entity99 said			1
" it is quite ironic that @entity10 has now agreed to himself pay tribute to the man he called a child predator			2
" the fan website @entity107 was one of several calling for a boycott of the show			2
" either they do n't have access to computers , telephones or do not know how to use @entity119 , " @entity113 said in an online statement			0
" but , there is no excuse for the tribute organizers not to know @entity10 should not be part of any @entity124			1
" global live events executives appeared with @entity6 matriarch @entity14 on @entity1 monday to announce the signing of @entity3			1
" i know he would be very excited about @entity3 , " @entity6 's mother said			1
but within minutes , their tribute 's facebook page was filled with negative fan reactions			1
" this is a complete disgrace , " wrote one fan			0
" you can kiss your audience goodbye folks			0
i doubt whether any self - respecting fan will pay a penny to see that man after the comments he made about @entity17			1
i 'm shocked this act was even considered			0
" the @entity3 controversy overshadowed other announcements that promoters expected would gain fan support for their show , including word that many of the musicians who played in @entity6 's touring band for the past two decades would reunite as the show 's house band			1
@entity154 , who served as musical director for several @entity6 tours , will direct the show			2
other acts signed for the show include @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164			0
alternative rock band @entity165 and @entity167 r&b singer @entity166 are also on the bill			0
members of the @entity171 set to take the stage include " the next generation of @entity174 " and @entity175 , which consists of @entity177 's three sons , the promoters said			0
it is also expected that one or more of the three @entity6 sisters -- @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 -- will perform			2
it appeared unlikely the tribute stage would be the scene for a reunion for the surviving members of the @entity174			0
while @entity191 , @entity177 and @entity192 support the concert , brothers @entity188 and @entity190 have publicly objected to the show being held at the same time as the trial for @entity6 's doctor			2
" while we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding @entity17 's death , " @entity188 and @entity190 said in a joint statement last month			1
dr. @entity208 's involuntary manslaughter trial is scheduled to begin in september and is expected to continue through october			0
" the trial is very important and i can understand how @entity190 and @entity188 feel , but it 's been two years , " @entity14 told @entity1 monday			0
" i thought it was a good idea ; i 'd like to keep @entity17 's legacy alive			1
" @entity14 plans to attend the trial , although she will miss some days to fly to @entity20 to attend the show with @entity6 's children , she said			2
" it will be on a saturday when the courtroom is dark , " said @entity215 , a @entity22 executive			0
