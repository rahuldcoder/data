-- across the seas and oceans of @entity3 , islands and the waters around them are frequently a source of dispute and even military confrontation			1
@entity11 and @entity12 squabble over @entity13 ; @entity11 and @entity14 claim sovereignty over islands in the @entity17 ( @entity18 to the @entity11 ; @entity18 to @entity14 )			2
several nations lay claim to the @entity21			2
but the coastline of the @entity23 -- where @entity24 meet -- is the most explosive of all			2
the @entity26 between the two @entity27 has long been settled in the permafrost of a diplomatic cold war			0
down to the last inch , the two sides know their limits			0
that 's not so at sea , where the @entity35 have long disagreed on whose waters end where -- especially in the @entity39 , which is dotted with islands			1
the @entity42 warship @entity43 was torpedoed in march in this disputed area , leaving 46 sailors dead			0
the island of @entity47 , the target of a @entity50 artillery barrage this week that killed four people , is in the same area			1
and upcoming exercises involving the @entity54 and @entity42 navies will take place in this part of the @entity23			0
at the heart of the dispute is what 's called the @entity61			1
in 1953 , after the @entity63 , the @entity62 unilaterally drew this line three nautical miles from the @entity50 coastline			1
that put five islands close to the coast under @entity42 control			2
it also hemmed in the port of @entity72 , the only deepwater harbor in the @entity24 that does n't freeze in winter			0
what was supposed to be a temporary arrangement has become permanent in the absence of a full peace agreement			0
the @entity61 is still in place today -- running close to the @entity50 shoreline for about 100 miles			1
@entity79 has never been happy about the arrangement , but only in the 1970s did it begin to challenge it			0
@entity50 has subsequently proposed a different line -- one that would roughly extend the @entity83 southwest out into the @entity23 , rather than hug the @entity50 shoreline			1
a few years ago , in typically colorful language , the @entity24 labeled the @entity61 " an illegal and brigandish line drawn by the @entity54 on our sacred territorial waters			1
" but the @entity17 has always resisted @entity79 's alternative line -- as it would have brought @entity50 's maritime boundary closer to its main port of @entity90			1
now add the fact that these waters are important fishing and crab grounds			2
for @entity50 fishermen especially , the blue crab season between june and september is an important source of income			1
ironically , those crabs have a habit of migrating south during these months			0
so these waters are frequently crowded with boats from both countries -- as well as vessels from @entity14 , just to complicate the picture			2
disputes over fishing rights have resulted in dozens of boat seizures			2
according to the @entity109 , the @entity24 seized 36 boats in the @entity23 in the 1990s			0
more recently , the coastal waters have seen armed clashes			0
the most serious of them were in 1999 and 2002 , which led to loss of life			0
the @entity50 may not wish to risk a full - scale naval engagement -- its warships came off much worse in the 1999 skirmishes and the technological gap between the two fleets has only widened since			1
last year , a @entity42 warship fired on and reportedly damaged a @entity50 vessel that was alleged to have crossed the @entity61 , leading @entity79 to condemn what it called " a grave armed provocation			1
" so the coastal waters of the @entity23 have long been the " theater " in which @entity79 could most easily provoke a crisis , and most easily legitimize it			0
added to which , such confrontations -- using artillery and patrol boats -- can be contained and managed			0
nuclear threats tend to leave less room for maneuver			0
in the wake of the latest incidents , both sides appear to be hardening their positions			0
@entity42 has strengthened its rules of engagement in the @entity23			0
far from reducing the marines stationed on the five islands off @entity50 's coast , as was planned , they will be reinforced			1
and there 's plenty of pressure in the @entity42 media for a hard line , with the conservative @entity152 claiming thursday that " the military has been implementing reforms that weaken defense capabilities " on the islands			1
few analysts expect any compromise on the @entity61 in the near future , given the overall deterioration in relations and the complex negotiations that would be necessary to find an alternative to what was meant to be a temporary solution nearly 60 years ago .			1

@entity3 islands are a common source of friction between countries in the region
the @entity61 was drawn in 1953
@entity50 wants to push the line further out to sea
the dispute also involves fishing *zones*
