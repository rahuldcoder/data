@entity0 walked out to her date 's car and found roses , a teddy bear and a card sitting in the passenger 's seat			2
inside the card was the million - dollar question : will you go to prom with me ? the 17 - year - old high school senior was touched			1
everyone at her all - girls private school in suburban @entity23 was hoping for some sort of " promposal , " the act of inviting someone to prom in an elaborate fashion , often involving props , dancing flash mobs or maybe even police or actor @entity19			1
in the moment , @entity26 said yes , " because it was such a nice gesture and he was so sweet and brave to go through with it			2
" later that evening , when she had a chance to process what had happened , she realized she did n't actually want to go with him			2
" i realized that prom is more of a couples atmosphere , " she said			1
" i did n't want to be there with someone i was not in a close relationship with			2
" while prom is a great excuse to dress up , party with friends and mark the passage of another school year , the annual rite of passage also carries a lot of pressure -- to look perfect , arrive in style and have the ideal date on your arm			1
@entity53 can add to the pressure , becoming almost as important as prom itself and raising expectations for young men and women , especially when they get posted on social media for all to see			1
sure , some promposals can be thoughtful , charming or downright heartwarming			1
they can teach teens to take healthy risks and nurture their romantic side in the hookup - culture era			2
but , as with anything , it 's all about intention			2
" as promposals have become more elaborate and public , so , too , does the potential for increased humiliation and social pressure , " said @entity70 , director of training and curriculum of @entity72 in @entity73 , a nationwide youth mentoring program that focuses on violence prevention and healthy relationships			1
" as promposal clips go viral , more and more young people think that you need to create these elaborate schemes to ask someone to prom and the reality is that it should be just a fun event for young people to dance and celebrate			1
" going all out and all in what used to be a potentially awkward phone call or hallway conversation is becoming an extremely public ceremony with high stakes			1
for some girls ( and , even some boys ) , not getting a promposal is their worst nightmare			1
and yet , being approached with flowers in the hallway can be a letdown , especially if a friend was serenaded in a flash mob			2
for others , these grandiose public gestures put invitees on the spot , forcing them to accept even if they do n't want to for fear of being perceived as mean or stuck up			1
opinion : the damaging message of proms boys also face pressure to be creative and do whatever it takes to get a yes			1
that 's the whole point , after all			0
sometimes , the effort comes from a genuine desire to make the invitee happy and have fun doing it			0
other times , the point really is to force a yes			1
@entity123 high school senior @entity122 has seen it go both ways			0
friends in relationships have staged promposals for the fun of it			1
he 's also seen classmates do them in front of invitees ' families to get a yes where they probably would not have received one otherwise			1
" it takes a lot for a guy to put himself out there for a girl , and they want to do everything they can to make sure they 're not humiliated , " he said			1
" by doing it in a special way , or publicly showing that he really wants to go with that person , 99 % of the time the girl will say yes			0
" either way , it can be a source of stress for both sides , @entity122 said			0
" i think it 's gotten to the point that if you do n't do it , you 'll have a hard time finding a date , " he said			0
if the answer is no , the emotional fallout can be damaging , @entity70 said			0
programs such as @entity72 in @entity73 's mentors in @entity168 work with teens nationwide on how to have mature conversations with potential love interests and how to deal with a breakup or rejection			1
" if their identity could potentially be challenged by a ' no ' to prom , we need to provide young men with the skills and ability to handle what could be a really embarrassing and traumatic public refusal , " @entity70 said			1
that 's where parents and adults come in , he said , to talk about realistic expectations around prom dating in general			1
" as adults , we should n't minimize promposals or teen relationships as puppy love or harmless crushes , " he said			1
" instead , we should view ( them ) as the first steps in developing intimate relationships , and how they handle them sets the stage for more complicated situations , like long - term dating , breakups , marriage and divorce			0
" testing the waters not all promposals are bad or ill - intentioned			1
to avoid potential embarrassment or hurt feelings , teens often put out feelers among friends to see if their potential date is interested			1
in best - case scenarios , the person knows what 's coming ; it 's just a matter of how and when , said @entity219 freshman @entity218			0
" i did n't feel any pressure to say yes because i already knew he was going to ask me , " said @entity218 , who accepted a promposal in 2012 from a close friend during dance class			1
" in that way it was fun because i did n't know how he was going to ask me ; it was a surprise			0
" promposals get iffy when the other person has no clue as to what 's coming , she said			1
in those situations , some girls say yes in the moment but then later turn down the guy in private			0
the alternative of public rejection can be worse for the girl , @entity218 wrote in a 2012 blog post for @entity243 , a girl - fueled activist movement that challenges media portrayals of women			0
" turning him down marks her as a ' huge bitch , ' a label she does n't deserve in any way			0
yes , rejecting him will hurt his feelings , but does n't every girl deserve the chance to make the decision that she wants to make ? " she wrote			0
further raising the stakes , though , is the " necessity " of capturing the event as a picture or video so it can be shared on social media , said @entity262 freshman @entity261 , whose 2013 promposal came in the form of a " prom " sign underneath the hood of a friend 's car			2
her twin sister got asked when a boy showed up at their home shirtless on a moped with roses in his mouth while his friends filmed the whole thing			0
" the filming was important ; it 's sort of a necessity to put something on @entity282 or @entity283 so everyone will know who asked who and when and how			1
it 's also critical that everyone watches the video so the next boy does n't accidentally copy a proposal that has already been done , " @entity261 said			0
" i remember being so happy that i was asked to prom , but also so disappointed that no one had been there to see it or to take a cute picture of us and post it on @entity282			2
" the pressure to couple up @entity26 , the suburban @entity23 teen , has nothing against promposals , especially among friends and couples			1
they have great potential to be sweet or thoughtful when done the right way			0
that 's what caught her off guard about her date 's promposal			0
they knew each other through mutual friends , but she knew in her heart that she did not want to bring someone she was not serious about to prom			2
she discovered this at her junior prom , when she brought a guy she did n't know well because she did n't want to be the only person without a date			2
they did n't really hit it off			0
" i realized i would rather go alone or with my friends , " she said			0
this year , @entity26 faced pressure from various corners to bring someone			2
even her grandparents offered to attempt to set her up with a busboy from their favorite restaurant			0
" it 's almost taboo at my school to go alone			0
" inspired by a friend who decided not to bring a date , @entity26 texted her date two weeks after his promposal and told him she changed her mind			0
he took it well , she said , and he found another date for his prom			2
@entity26 ended up going to hers without a date last week			0
she had a great time dancing and posing for pictures with her friends , including others who went alone			0
i have no regrets , " she said			0
" to girls who get promposed to and do n't know what to do , i would just say you only have one prom			2
think about what 's going to make you happy and remain true to who you are			0

" @entity53 " are becoming almost as important as prom itself
sometimes , they work ; other times , they can be awkward
@entity53 can create pressure for boys to outdo peers
sometimes , promposals put invitees on spot to say yes
