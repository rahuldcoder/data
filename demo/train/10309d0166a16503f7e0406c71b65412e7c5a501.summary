the sound of metal hitting the floor echoed through the hallways of the childless elementary school			1
it was an empty clip from a gun , fallen to the ground			2
" that sound should be imprinted in your brain , " @entity8 , co-founder of @entity9 , told the educators in the audience			1
" that is the sound of survival			0
that is the sound of opportunity			0
" that , @entity8 said , is the best time to attack a shooter if one enters the school or classroom			1
on a recent saturday in @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity8 and his partner , @entity26 , conducted a free active shooter self - defense workshop for teachers and school staff members			1
since the deadly school shootings in @entity32 , @entity33 , last year , school security plans have included arming teachers , adding police officers and armed security guards , changing how schools are designed and adding bulletproof backpacks and whiteboards to schools			1
in the new school year , some educators are taking it upon themselves to be prepared for the unthinkable			1
what really makes schools safer ? the self - defense trainers , both parents , believe that workshops like this one should be mandatory for educators			1
" you got to make sure you get those fire drills in every year , " said @entity8 , who was a @entity50 in 2012 for his work with senior citizens			0
" fire drills are important , do n't get me wrong , but guess what , kids are n't dying in fires			0
they 're dying because they are being shot			0
that 's the truth , and that 's the threat			0
" they passed out a pocket - sized active shooter reference guide published by the @entity65 ( @entity66 ) that says people have three options when an active shooter enters a location : run , hide or fight			1
" fight as a last resort and only when your life is in imminent danger , " it says			1
this course offered guidance on how to escape or take cover but focused most of its four hours on how to fight and disarm an attacker -- something few educators have ever considered how to do			1
" it 's very sad that we have to go through this kind of training to know how to protect our kids , " said @entity82 , a teacher of 25 years who works with young children			1
the protection exercises started with a fake gun pointed at the educators			2
" it takes the fear out of it , " @entity8 said			0
participants were taught how to grab the barrel and point it away while holding the slide so the handgun can not fire			0
parts of the workshop were similar to a self - defense classes , where participants learned how and where to hit and the best position to stand when approaching an attacker			1
" you have eight weapons , " @entity26 told the class			0
" two hands , two elbows , two knees , two feet			0
" the educators of all ages practiced how to use those body parts on pads held by the instructors ; they were encouraged to make every strike fueled with aggression and anger			1
" we do n't need to be armed with a weapon -- a gun per se , " said @entity119 , a day - care owner who took the class			2
" but if we have knowledge of how to use our bodies and our surroundings , than that in itself is the best form of arming ourselves			0
" the tactics and strategies were tailored toward a school setting , instructors said , and part of the workshop focused on the school and classroom setup			1
teachers were told which ordinary items found in a classroom might be used as weapons -- for example , throwing a stapler at the shooter or using it to hit an attacker in the temple			2
if scissors were available , educators were told to aim for the eyes			2
" who cares how you incapacitate ? " @entity26 said			0
" just attack the attacker			0
that 's the mind set			0
" teachers lessons ' in heroism and healing in the school 's hallway , educators got a detailed lesson in how to run from the sound of bullets			1
" ' cover ' means that whatever you are behind will stop a bullet , " @entity8 explained , urging them to run from cover to cover			2
when told to hide , @entity8 reminded the group that if they are n't seen , they 're less likely to be shot			2
the workshop ended with a " bad guy " with a gun entering the classroom			0
the educators were taught how to find the room 's " blind spot " : a place where they wo n't be seen when the shooter entered the room			2
it was also the best position , the trainer said , to use the element of surprise if they needed to disarm the shooter			0
a shooter , of course , that these educators wanted to prepare for but never hope to encounter			2
" in addition to us providing exceptional education for the students , first and foremost , they have to be protected , " @entity82 said			1
" if they 're not safe , then it does n't matter what we do from an educational standpoint			0

some @entity24 educators recently took self - defense training in case of a school shooting
instructors say guides on how to hide , run or fight should be mandatory for teachers
teacher and trainee : " students , first and foremost , they have to be protected "
