@entity0 -- every spring , when @entity3 in @entity4 opens for the season , the @entity2 flies in six people to staff the airport 's one - lane security checkpoint			1
every fall , it flies the screeners home			0
all of that will soon change			0
the @entity2 said monday it will allow the state - owned airport to hire a private company to conduct the @entity2 screening , making those six screener jobs available to local residents and , quite possibly , saving the federal government money			1
locally hired screeners cost half as much as flown - in screeners , because the government does n't have to pay for travel , per diem and housing , according to a 2008 report by the @entity26 's @entity25			2
that came to $ 219 a day , versus $ 511 per day , in 2005 , the year cited in the report			0
but the @entity2 's decision to allow @entity3 to privatize its security workforce is a rare concession these days			1
the @entity2 simultaneously rejected requests to privatize screening at two other airports : @entity35 , also in @entity4 , and @entity36 in @entity37			2
@entity2 administrator @entity38 one year ago put the brakes on the government 's privatization program , saying he would approve contract security only if airports could demonstrate it would not hurt security and if there was a " clear and substantial " advantage to the federal government			1
@entity38 's action demonstrated his philosophy that protecting aviation is a federal government responsibility , and that privatizing the workforce can decrease his flexibility to move screeners between airports in response to threats			1
on tuesday , a @entity60 will take up the question of whether airport security is best provided by government screeners or the private sector			1
subcommittee chairman @entity65 , @entity66 , said the " @entity72 , " as the privatization effort is formally known , creates jobs by replacing federal screeners with private screeners , without impacting security			1
though little noticed by the traveling public , the government already allows 16 airports to employ private screeners , including @entity77			2
the private screeners wear @entity2 uniforms , work under @entity2 supervision and follow @entity2 rules and protocols			1
but other airports want to join			0
some airport executives have argued that contract security personnel are more courteous than government workers			2
" it was felt that a private contractor would provide friendlier customer service to the traveling public , " the head of a @entity89 , @entity90 , airport wrote to @entity91			2
for @entity95 , a @entity4 state transportation department official who sought the change at @entity3 , it 's a simple question of jobs			0
the six @entity2 jobs held by nonresidents soon will be held by residents , she said			0
" we support our people , " she said			0
" even if we could get one @entity4 job we would be happy			0
" the @entity2 said it soon will request bids to operate the airport 's security			1
the change " could allow the agency to reassign federal resources to other airports , which would be advantageous to the comprehensive security network , " a spokesman said			0
the other two airports -- @entity119 and @entity36 -- " failed to demonstrate an operational , security , or cost advantage that provides a clear and substantial benefit over federalized screening operations , " he said .			0

instead of *flying* in federal employees , airport will be able to hire locally
plan may save the federal government money
@entity2 decision to allow private security workforce is a rare concession these days
