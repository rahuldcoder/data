-- the leadership of @entity3 's airport fired back saturday at critics who had rallied around a commercial pilot who had posted videos online showing what he described as shortcomings in security			1
the series of videos featured scenes from inside the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) and were narrated by the pilot , who pointed out the contrast between the passengers , who were heavily scrutinized , and airport employees who just passed through a single door			1
the footage was posted , and later removed , from the popular video - sharing website @entity20			0
" a recent @entity20 video , posted by a @entity25 airline pilot , presents false and misleading information on @entity12 's security program , " the airport said in a statement			1
" the video shows a door with a card swipe and suggests that access is gained to the airfield area through this door			0
in fact , the door shown in the video provides access only to an employee lunchroom			0
" the pilot who posted the videos requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue			1
" i was trying to bring up the obvious , ludicrous @entity43 - type of security , " he told @entity0			1
the pilot said he did n't think much about posting his videos online in late november , but that within a matter of days his chief pilot called him to ask him to remove them because they were " stirring a commotion			1
" in its statement saturday , the airport defended its practices , stressing that there are variances in the security system based on various factors and that many layers of protection can not easily be seen			2
" proper and effective security requires multiple layers of systems , procedures and policies that are interlaced and constantly monitored , " the airport said			2
" the vast majority of the widespread layers of this security program are behind the scenes and transparent to casual observers			2
" a few days after the pilot posted the videos , he said , the @entity43 told him he was being suspended from the @entity76 program			1
as an officer in that program , the federal agency had deputized him , among others , to carry a handgun in the cockpit			2
the pilot said four air marshals and two local deputies then showed up at his home near @entity85 to personally confiscate his weapon			0
the only answer he could get from the security agency as to why he was suspended from the program was that he may have violated a regulation , the pilot said			1
the @entity43 said that it holds those serving as federal flight deck officers to " the highest ethical standards , " and said it took action because the pilot was in the program			1
" ( participants in the flight deck officer program ) must be able to maintain sensitive security information , " said the agency 's spokeswoman @entity95			1
" as the issuing authority of credentials and firearms , @entity43 reviews each possible violation of those standards and acts accordingly up to and including removing an individual from the assigned role			2
" in the aftermath of the incident , the pilot said he resigned from the program			0
he added that he did n't consider that divulging such sensitive information online would stir controversy			0
" i did n't think anything would come of it , " said the 50 - year - old pilot , a veteran who was a maintenance test pilot			0
" this is really about getting the message out and demanding intelligent security , " @entity118 , the pilot 's attorney , told @entity0			0
" no state secrets are being shown here			0
what 's being shown here is a lack of security			0
" but the airport disagrees			0
" @entity12 is proud to both an innovator and a trendsetter in aviation security , " it said in its statement			0
" @entity12 meets , and in many cases , exceeds every federal security requirement			1

online videos show what a pilot claims was *lax* security at the @entity3 airport
the airport says the videos present " false and misleading information "
it says it meets or exceeds every federal security requirement
the @entity43 has suspended the pilot from the @entity76 program
