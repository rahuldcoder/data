-- even hardened race fans , accustomed to witnessing spectacular crashes , were stunned to see the shattered body of 20 - year - old race car driver @entity4 sprawled on a @entity6 dirt track saturday night			1
he had been run over and killed by a car driven by @entity9 , one of the most famous , charismatic and controversial drivers on the $ 3 billion - per - year @entity12 race circuit			1
much of the public 's interest in @entity9 undoubtedly derives , not only from his winning record but also from his tough guy , bad boy image reminiscent of the sport 's early rough - and - tumble days			1
that image will certainly be one of the things authorities in @entity6 will be looking at when trying to decide whether to close this case as a tragic accident or to press forward with criminal charges			0
the preliminary signals from the @entity27 would indicate a favorable outcome for @entity9			0
sheriff @entity29 has announced that the @entity4 tragedy is viewed as an " on track crash , " and that to date there was no evidence of " criminal intent			1
" the sheriff did hedge a bit by saying that the " investigation was continuing			0
" the sheriff has undoubtedly been carefully reviewing the amateur video of the crash			1
it depicts @entity9 's car in close proximity to @entity4 's car coming out of @entity45 in the race			1
@entity4 's car then appears to be pushed into the outside wall , forcing his car out of the race			1
@entity4 then appears to exit his vehicle angrily and charges on to the racetrack , pointing in the direction of @entity9 's and other drivers ' swiftly approaching cars			1
in graphic and stunning video footage , young @entity4 is hit , apparently by the right rear tire of @entity9 's vehicle , causing him to be dragged down the track to his death			1
we can expect that @entity29 will continue his investigation by interviewing witnesses and undoubtedly obtaining copies of other videos taken from different angles			0
he will likely consult with experts in racing			0
his key questions : 1			0
was @entity4 's decision to stand in the track , so close to moving vehicles unusual ? 2			2
should @entity9 , knowing he may have struck @entity4 's car , have anticipated a problem when approaching the turn as a " yellow flag " had been thrown warning drivers to proceed cautiously as an accident or debris ahead was likely ? @entity29 will be working in close conjunction with the @entity82 , @entity83 , a seven - term veteran of criminal investigations and trials			1
@entity83 supervises a staff of about 10 attorneys that serves a county with a population of about 107,000 residents			0
@entity6 , on average , prosecutes 5 % of vehicular accident death cases as criminal matters			0
most cases are viewed as tragic accidents caused by either driver or pedestrian negligence			0
cases prosecuted criminally usually involve charges of drunken or drugged driving			0
so far no allegations of intoxicated driving have emerged in the @entity9 / @entity4 investigation			2
in this case it will be impossible to know what was going through @entity9 's mind as he approached the @entity4 vehicle under the warning of a yellow flag			1
to prosecute this case as an intentional murder or even as a more serious form of manslaughter , there would have to be proof that @entity9 " intentionally " aimed his car at @entity4 seeking to kill or injure him seriously			2
@entity9 's intent here is impossible to prove regardless of his bad boy reputation unless he were to confess to an intentional murder			1
i think it 's safe to say that is not going to happen			0
prosecutors will next examine whether @entity9 operated his vehicle with " depraved indifference , " " recklessness " or " criminal negligence " at the track that night			2
evidence of such conduct would be necessary to support any nonintentional murder , manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide charge			0
the evidence supporting criminal charges is conspicuously absent given what we now know about the case			0
@entity4 recklessly choose to walk into an active and highly dangerous racetrack exposing himself to injury or death			2
an experienced professional driver such as @entity9 had a right to expect that his fellow drivers would conduct themselves in a safe and professional manner during the race			2
collisions are a common part of the race scene , and one would expect a driver in @entity4 's vulnerable position to get off the track and out of harm 's way immediately			1
@entity9 was , no doubt , shocked to see @entity4 in the roadway pointing in his direction as he approached the turn again			2
in fact , @entity9 's car appears to fishtail slightly , indicating an attempt to avoid contact with @entity4			1
in determining whether @entity9 's conduct was reckless or criminally negligent , the conduct of the other drivers in the race will be examined			1
they appear to be proceeding at a similar speed as @entity9 under the yellow flag warning			0
they too were probably surprised to see @entity4 positioned in such a dangerous place			0
the evidence supporting criminal charges is just not here			0
in the end , all signs point to a red flag for any criminal charges against @entity9 in this tragic accident arising from @entity180 's most popular summer sport .			2

@entity12 driver @entity9 's car hit and killed driver @entity4 during race
@entity185 : sheriff likely to look at @entity9 's bad boy image and amateur video of crash
@entity185 : still , sheriff says , no evidence of criminal intent on @entity9 's part
@entity185 : @entity4 recklessly walked onto track ; @entity9 had right to think that would not happen
