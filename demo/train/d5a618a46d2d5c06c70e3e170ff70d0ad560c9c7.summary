at gun stores from coast to coast , and on the @entity3 , they are known as " exploding targets			1
" but the man who oversees @entity7 's bomb squad has another name for them : @entity10			1
amazingly simple to assemble -- just pour two powders into one container and shake -- the targets are a safe and fun way to enhance target shooting , manufacturers say			1
shoot it with a bullet from a safe distance , and you 'll be rewarded with a concussive blast and a cloud of smoke , indicating you 've hit your target			2
but if you search @entity25 for " @entity26 " -- the most popular brand -- and you 'll find more than 100,000 videos depicting the use -- and more frequently , the misuse -- of the product			1
on - line videos show people in a veritable contest to see who can detonate the most explosives in the most innovative way , demolishing pumpkins and watermelons , dead cows and pigs , washing machines and refrigerators , old cars and trucks , @entity47 dolls and even a trailer home			1
to heighten the impact , diehards mixed it with gasoline , diesel fuel or propane tanks , creating explosions that crater the land , trigger car alarms , and shaking nearby communities			2
in one video that is now an internet staple , a @entity60 man in 2008 detonated 100 pounds of @entity26 in the dump box of an old dump truck , sending the truck aloft -- while rattling a nearby nuclear power plant and , inconveniently , the police department			2
the nuclear plant went into a short lockdown and the man later pleaded guilty to two felonies involving explosives			2
last year , @entity7 became the first state to regulate exploding targets , requiring users to be trained and licensed to handle explosives			1
some @entity76 jurisdictions have also interpreted state law to restrict use of the targets			1
and last month , exploding targets got even more notoriety when the @entity82 banned the targets on its property in five western states ( @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 ) saying the targets ignited 16 fires on @entity82 lands coast - to - coast since january 2012			1
the cost of extinguishing those fires : more than $ 33 million			2
@entity82 officials say they hope to extend the year - long ban , and extend it nationwide			1
and in march , the @entity99 distributed a bulletin to law enforcement agencies nationwide warning that exploding targets could be used " as an explosive for illicit purposes by criminals and extremists " and its components could be used to make ieds			1
one state 's decision @entity7 chief deputy state fire marshal @entity110 said he fought to regulate exploding targets after the product appeared on local gun store shelves			1
gun stores were giving @entity7 residents a " false sense that it was ok to use , " he said , even though customers unknowingly broke @entity7 law preventing them from " manufacturing " explosives whenever they combined the targets ' two ingredients			1
so @entity122 pushed a bill to expand the definition of explosive to include " two or more components " when packaged together that create a bomb			2
the bill failed on its first two attempts , but passed in 2012 after a representative from the @entity130 signed a letter saying the @entity130 was taking " no position " on the bill			2
gun rights advocates did not oppose the measure " because there are so many other things that are more important to us , and it does n't really involve guns , " said @entity140 , legislative vice president of @entity141 of @entity142			2
" we looked at it , considered the impact on our members and wrote it off as another feel - good issue by the left wing that has nothing better to do			2
" @entity140 said he remains " philosophically " opposed to the restrictions since " we banned one more thing that was n't causing a problem			2
" @entity110 acknowledges that exploding targets had not caused many problems in @entity7			1
but , he said , as the products began appearing on local store shelves , @entity7 wanted to be in front of the problem			1
" this is a high explosive and it belongs in the category with other high explosives , " @entity110 said			2
" we 're not going to wait for an incident to occur where this product is used , where it 's just purchased off the shelf			1
we are not sorry for the action we took			2
" fire marshals from several other states have sought @entity7 's guidance as they contemplate similar regulations , he said			1
in @entity174 this year , self - described " very pro-gun " @entity176 state sen. @entity175 introduced a bill to require retailers to place @entity26 in locked displays , and to require that purchasers to be at least 18			0
there are currently no age limits on its purchase			0
the bill died under the weight of legislative business , @entity175 told @entity188 , although he may introduce it again			0
" i considered this a homeland security issue , and i can envision this being a real problem for law enforcement someday , " @entity175 said			0
few federal restrictions exploding targets consist of ammonium nitrate ( an oxidizer ) and aluminum powder ( a fuel )			1
but because neither component individually is explosive , they not regulated by the @entity201 ( @entity201 )			0
once the components are mixed , the results is an explosive material and subject to @entity201 regulations			0
however , under federal law , individuals can manufacture explosives for their own personal , non-business use			0
there is no federal limit on the amount of explosives an individual can make			0
federal law , in short , does not prohibit exploding targets			1
but , federal officials say , federal law does regulate the manufacture of explosive devices , and federal laws could be used to prosecute individuals who use the targets in the construction of explosive devices			1
the intent of the individual is a factor in determining legality , officials said			0
some state and local governments have taken action against sports shooters , especially in cases in which they 've mixed large volumes of the target ingredients			0
in the case of @entity241 , the @entity60 man who shot at the 100 pounds of @entity26 in the dump truck , prosecutors viewed the truck not as a target , but as a bomb			0
" it looks like they legally bought ( the components )			0
it was shipped to them by the @entity26 people , " said @entity248 , assistant county attorney for @entity249			0
but when the components were mixed and placed in the dump truck , " we looked at our definition of an explosive device and it definitely qualified , " @entity248 said			0
" it was how they used it , which was enormously dangerous and ill - conceived , " @entity241 said			0
" it was enormously reckless how they were using it			0
they had no idea what they were doing and you can tell by their reaction ( in a videotape of the incident )			0
" according to a police report , a large piece of metal flew over @entity279 head , even though he was 300 yards from the blast			0
fire problem @entity283 , the @entity284 - based manufacturer of the most popular brand of explosive targets , said it is being harmed by the widespread misuse of the product			1
and by people wrongly claiming that other products are " @entity26			0
" " you can @entity292 all day long and the first thing that will be popping up , people will be misusing our product and other products , other brands of binary exploding targets			1
it 's a misuse , " said @entity299 , a publicist for @entity283			0
" our produce was created to be used as a shot indicator			0
with @entity26 , you can see if you actually hit your target without having to walk down the range			0
and when you misuse a product , you could potentially be breaking the law			1
" the rampant misuse of exploding targets is a " threat to our business , " @entity299 concedes , so much so that the company is now soliciting videos of people using the product as intended			1
" if people get hurt they 're going to be more regulations and restrictions			0
we want people to be able to have fun with the product ... if they keep misusing it , people may not have that liberty anymore			1
" but federal officials take issue with @entity26 's claims that their product can not result in fires			1
at a press conference announcing the ban on exploding targets in certain national forests , it released a video showing a bale of hay catching fire after an exploding target was shot			1
the target was tannerite , said @entity82 spokesman @entity342			1
@entity342 said other brands also cause fires , and the @entity82 is likely to extend its ban to other regions			1
a big bang at a farm on @entity7 's @entity350 , bomb squad member @entity348 takes aims a @entity352 rifle at targets at a range bounded by soybean fields , woods and an earthen berm			1
he flawlessly shoots at a series of targets set up to demonstrate the fire marshal 's concerns about exploding targets			1
first , a one - pound binary target sitting on a stump , as intended by the manufacturer			0
then he flawlessly shoots at targets in front of a human silhouette , a watermelon , and finally , an old bomb squad protective suit			2
it shreds part of the suit , dislodging one of the protective plates			0
looking at the damaged bomb suit , @entity110 says he has no reservations about restricting access to the targets			2
he believes the targets are dangerous , even when used as intended			2
" it ( the explosive ingredients ) are all in a kit			0
it 's already made for me			0
i have instructions on how to do it			0
it 's an explosive kit for dummies , and it 's pretty easy to make			0
" says his bomb squad commander , @entity389 , " the fact of the matter is , this is recreational use of explosives by people who have not been trained			0

videos *proliferate* of " exploding targets "
many @entity25 videos show the product being misused
@entity82 blames targets for 16 *wildfires*
@entity7 regulates the targets ; predicts other states will follow
