-- a labor union representing nearly 20,000 border patrol agents and staff friday disputed comments made by @entity6 gov. @entity5 that most illegal immigrants coming across the southern border are smuggling drugs			1
@entity5 initially made the comments earlier this month during a debate of @entity13 gubernatorial candidates			2
she repeated them friday when asked by a reporter for the basis of the claim			0
" well , we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to @entity6 and trespassing are now becoming drug mules , " @entity5 said			2
" they 're coming across our borders in huge numbers			0
the drug cartels have taken control of the immigration			0
" so they are criminals			0
they 're breaking the law when they are trespassing and they 're criminals when they pack the marijuana and the drugs on their backs			0
" when pressed , @entity5 explained that many are simply coming to the @entity39 to look for work but " are accosted , and they become subjects of the drug cartels			1
" @entity44 of the @entity45 told @entity0 that @entity5 's claims were " clearly not the case			1
" @entity44 said that some undocumented immigrants caught by border patrol agents have drugs on them , and that they sometimes blame pressure from the drug cartels			1
but , he said , those claims have little credibility because drug smugglers are typically transporting much larger quantities of drugs			0
and besides , he said , if what @entity5 said were true , there would be many more prosecutions for drug smuggling			2
@entity5 's comments , @entity44 said , do n't " comport with reality -- that 's the nicest way to put it			1
" @entity5 doubled down on the comments later friday , however , issuing a statement reiterating them			2
" the simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels , which are by definition smuggling drugs , " @entity5 's statement said , according to the @entity67 as reported in the @entity68			1
" it is common knowledge that @entity80 drug cartels have merged human smuggling with drug trafficking			0
" @entity5 said the " human rights violations that have taken place ( by the cartels ) victimizing immigrants and their families are abhorrent			1
" @entity5 's statement is the center of a controversy over a recently passed law that requires law enforcement officials to ascertain the citizenship of the subject of any investigation if they have reason to believe their suspect is in this country illegally			1
the @entity39 @entity98 is considering whether to file suit against the law .			0
