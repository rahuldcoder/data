-- the death of @entity3 superstar @entity2 , who wrestled under the name " @entity2 , " has sparked discussion in wrestling circles over the rigors of the sport			1
@entity2 , 36 , died friday of a heart attack in a hospital in @entity12 , @entity13 , a family friend confirmed			1
also known as " the @entity14 , " the 6 - foot - 4 - inch , 350 - pound wrestler earned a reputation for executing moves with more ease than one might expect from someone his size , facing off in high - profile bouts with @entity3 celebrities such as @entity23 and @entity24			0
" he was basically known for being an athletic , big man who carried some extra weight around , but moved very well for a guy his size , " said @entity25 , an assistant sports editor of the @entity26 who also runs its professional - wrestling blog , @entity28			2
comments on @entity25 's blog range from messages of condolences to speculation over whether drugs were involved and the struggles wrestlers grapple with outside of the ring			1
" [ @entity43 ] ardly do we realize what do these wrestlers go through ...			2
. not that long ago he looked as if he could go on for 20 years in the ring looking as vicious as he was , " one post says			0
@entity2 worked on and off for the @entity3 for several years before the organization terminated his contract in june for violating the @entity3 's @entity51 and refusing to enter rehab , the @entity3 said on its web site , without providing specifics			1
the organization offered its condolences to @entity2 's family in a brief statement on its site			1
details of @entity2 's death have not been released , but @entity25 said the death highlights a larger problem of professional wrestlers dying in their 30s and 40s			1
@entity2 's death comes less than nine months after @entity67 pro wrestler @entity66 reportedly died of a drug overdose , and follows a string of high - profile deaths in the past decade , including those of @entity72 and @entity73			1
" it 's happening a lot more frequently in the sport than it ever did , and it 's a huge problem , " @entity25 said			1
" if this was @entity79 and you had guys dropping dead under 40 , it would be a much bigger deal -- but because it 's wrestling , it flies under the radar			2
" though wrestlers today have more support systems available through the @entity3 and other groups , the rigors of the sport have increased dramatically compared to the days of capt. @entity90 , who died this year at 76 , @entity25 said			1
" the expectations for what wrestlers are supposed to look like have evolved			2
in @entity90 's day , some were in good shape , some were not , but you did n't see the superhuman physiques like you started seeing in the 80s , " he said			1
as the industry has gone global , wrestlers also are traveling more and going farther than they did @entity102 , when wrestlers and promoters worked within limited territories , he said			0
and the demands in the ring are higher than ever			0
" you could get by with doing less back in the day , you did n't see a lot of high - risk maneuvers			0
and as it has evolved , so has the need to do more risky - looking stunts , and that 's why guys get a lot of bumps and bruises , and you can sort of make the correlation that that leads to more painkillers			0
" in an interview with @entity0 after @entity90 's death , @entity3 spokesman @entity121 said the organization provides medical assistance and financial guidance through the @entity3 's @entity51 to all its wrestlers , even though they are considered independent contractors			1
" if they 're injured on the job in the ring , we take care of their medical expenses and get them to the best doctors possible , " @entity121 said			0
" in addition to their physical well - being , we also take them through financial counseling and financial workshops so they know what to do with their money as far as income , earnings and sponsorships			0
and those are just a few aspects of the program			0
" to friends and family , @entity2 was a devoted family man who was looking forward to spending more time with his children after leaving the @entity3			2
" he had his demons , but he found a lot of strength in his family , " said family friend and former @entity3 personality @entity158			0
" he comes from a long line of professional wrestlers and did his family proud			0
" @entity158 , the founder of @entity165 , a support group for aging and retired wrestlers , says @entity2 's death highlights the unique struggles that wrestlers face as independent contractors who do n't receive the benefits of athletes or professional actors			1
like many wrestlers , @entity2 did not have health insurance when he died , leaving friends and family scrambling to cover his medical expenses , @entity158 said			1
" we make above average income , but most of what we make goes toward the expense of being in the business , and health care is a huge expense for a wrestler , " @entity158 said			0
@entity158 said she started @entity165 with the goal of working with insurance companies to create an affordable health care plan for wrestlers			1
" to find health care that covers wrestlers costs quadruple the price of regular coverage , so a lot of the guys end up going without			2
they continue to wrestle way past their prime because there 's no pension , and because there 's no health care , they never prepared for their future health concerns			2
it 's an endless cycle			0
" but @entity158 and former @entity3 diva @entity209 say camaraderie and the thrill of being in the ring are worth the risks			0
" yes , we make good money , but for what we do it 's paltry			0
we are like paupers compared to most other professions , but our pride in entertaining and making sure that when you pay money and come to a show you are absolutely entertained , that 's why we do what we do , " @entity209 said .			2
