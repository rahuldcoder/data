the open mike i - wish - i - had n't - said - that moment when @entity3 president @entity2 called @entity5 prime minister @entity4 a " liar " and @entity6 did n't disagree is a tale as old as the hills for @entity11 presidents and secretaries of state			1
for decades , @entity11 presidents and diplomats have been locked in uneasy relationships with @entity5 prime ministers from the @entity18			1
one example : " who 's the f --- - superpower here , " a frustrated @entity19 exploded to his aides after his first meeting with @entity4 in 1996			2
it 's a good thing for @entity6 that the open mike caught @entity2 with the ad hominem attack on @entity4 rather than the president			1
" i ca n't stand him			0
he 's a liar , " @entity2 said			2
@entity6 was heard to say , " you 're tired of him -- what about me ? i have to deal with him every day , " according to a @entity3 website			0
i 'm sure many people would have loved to have heard more of what @entity6 thinks			0
there 's no doubt that @entity6 is frustrated and angry in the extreme with what he perceives to be @entity4 's recalcitrance when it comes to @entity46 - @entity5 peacemaking			1
indeed if there was a cartoon bubble over the president 's head , i guarantee you his sentiments would have matched or even exceeded , @entity2 's			2
when it comes to " @entity4 " @entity4 , our somewhat detached and cool president is hot and very combustible			2
when @entity4 was dismissively lecturing the president during their press conference last june in @entity61 , the look on @entity6 's face was somewhere between mortification and raw anger			1
if looks could kill , we would have had a new @entity5 prime minister by now			1
@entity11 - @entity5 relations on any number of issues are extremely close , even intimate ; and the @entity69 nuclear challenge will almost certainly make them even closer			1
but the @entity46 - @entity5 peace issue seems to bring out the worst in both sides , and it has for years now			2
@entity72 and @entity73 went at it in 1975 over a second @entity76 disengagement agreement ( @entity72 recalled our @entity78 ambassadors as part of his so - called reassessment of the @entity11 - @entity5 relationship )			1
president @entity82 and prime minister @entity83 had a huge flap over settlements during the @entity87 summit			1
president @entity88 believed then - @entity5 prime minister @entity89 misled him on settlements during their first meeting in 1989 ; and the relationship really never recovered			1
and secretary of state @entity93 wrestled with @entity89 as well during the run - up to the @entity96 peace conference in 1991			0
so @entity6 is only the latest in a line of frustrated @entity11 presidents and secretaries of state			1
they have had to deal with a close ally who can also be withholding and maddening when it comes to protecting @entity5 's political and security interests in a conflict in which they have much more to lose than the @entity11 mediator if things do n't turn out right			1
but president @entity6 's @entity4 problem is different in several respects from his predecessors -- a fact that all but guarantees that tensions with the @entity5 on this issue are not going to subside anytime soon			1
the 2012 election has kept them in a box			0
indeed , the president 's speech at the @entity121 last month notwithstanding -- more a campaign speech than one that addressed the @entity5 - @entity126 issue -- if @entity6 is re-elected , buckle your seat belts			1
it 's going to be a wild ride with the @entity5			2
first , the others -- @entity72 , @entity82 , @entity88 41 , and @entity93 , unlike @entity6 ( so far ) -- all succeeded			0
their fights with their @entity5 counterparts were productive ; indeed they all had a strategy -- and sufficient will and commitment on the part of @entity5 and @entity46 to do serious diplomacy			0
at the end of the day , despite the tensions , everybody went home a winner			0
even @entity19 managed to hammer out two agreements with @entity4 , though neither was completely implemented			0
second , part of the reason these three succeeded was that despite the toughness and the tension , there was a third " t " -- a modicum of trust that allowed each side to work with the other in something other than a zero - sum game environment			0
they built a mutual stake in the other 's success			0
former secretary of state @entity93 will tell you that he had plenty of struggles with @entity89 , but the two worked out a good personal relationship -- no leaks , respecting mutual red lines and so on			0
president @entity6 has yet to do that , and neither has @entity4			1
on the @entity46 - @entity5 issue , the president believes @entity4 is a con man , and @entity4 thinks the president wants somebody else as prime minister			1
the president is almost certainly persuaded that @entity4 is buying time , playing @entity11 politics and hoping that the next president is a @entity180 who wo n't be so focused on pressing @entity5 on the peace process			1
if the administration could find a way to engineer regime change in @entity5 , it would			0
indeed , the key folks that deal with the peace process at @entity190 and at the @entity191 are veterans of dealing with @entity4 ( @entity192 and @entity193 )			2
they have seen the movie before , and they had hoped not to be in the sequel			0
finally , there 's the president himself , who clearly believes he knows best how to run the peace process			0
@entity6 does n't just have a @entity4 problem , he 's got an @entity5 problem			1
@entity6 is not anti-israel , but unlike his two predecessors -- @entity19 and @entity203 -- he 's not in love with the idea of @entity5			2
he falls somewhere north of @entity82 on the @entity207 spectrum and south of @entity88			0
here the president 's coolness and detachment works against him			0
his early tough rhetoric against settlements and his commitment to fix the peace process whether or not @entity5 agreed created a pretty rocky foundation for gaining the trust and confidence so critical on the @entity5 side , if a president wants them to do politically tough things later			2
yes , mr. president , @entity5 can be frustrating			0
just ask @entity72 , @entity82 and @entity93			0
and this @entity5 prime minister may simply not be willing or able to do the deal you want him to do			1
but if there 's any chance of it , you 're going to have to find a better way to deal with him , figure out how to stabilize the relationship and find a better balance than pandering to @entity4 on one hand or trying to punish him on the other			2
and in the meantime , stay away from any live mikes .			0

president @entity6 did n't *object* when @entity2 called @entity5 prime minister a " liar "
@entity243 says there 's a long *history* of @entity11 presidents *clashing* with @entity5 *leaders*
he says @entity6 - @entity4 relationship is worse because there 's no trust
@entity243 : to *achieve* *progress* on peace , @entity6 needs improved relationship with @entity4
