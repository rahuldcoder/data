-- @entity1 ended 2012 on an incredible high after a fairytale first victory on the @entity3 , but his hopes of capitalizing on that breakthrough win have been blown away in the season - opener in @entity7			1
the @entity9 golfer overcame a debilitating panic attack in @entity11 to qualify for the 30 - man @entity12 , returning to the course at @entity15 after being taken to hospital			1
however , the traditional curtain - raiser for the elite @entity9 circuit has yet to get going , with high winds and rain causing play to be canceled on friday , saturday and sunday			1
the $ 5.7 million event has been reduced from four rounds to three , with 36 holes to be played on monday and the final 18 on tuesday			1
@entity1 : i thought i was going to die if the wind continues to blow , even that is looking unlikely			2
organizers face the prospect of it being reduced to " unofficial " status if only two rounds are possible -- while a cut to 18 holes would mean none of the purse counts for the 2013 money list			2
@entity3 chief of operations @entity37 said the forecast is improving , with winds due to drop from nearly 50 miles per hour ( 80 kph ) to 25 - 30 mph ( 40 - 50 kph )			1
" it 's the gusts that creep up above 40 that have knocked us out			0
we had registered gusts up to 48 mph right before we suspended play today , " @entity37 told the @entity3 website on sunday			1
" somewhere in the low 40s is what puts us out of business			0
" while players actually got out on the course on saturday and sunday , they were left frustrated as balls blew off their tees and disappeared off putting greens after being placed			0
" they have not mowed the greens in two days and the wind is still blowing balls off the green , " @entity1 wrote on @entity59			2
" brutal been in @entity7 for a week and still have not played a competitive round of golf			2
" @entity68 golf star @entity67 also took to @entity59 after being accused of taking too long over a putt by @entity71 commentator @entity70			0
" oh that was why i was taking a while			0
@entity74 had a 40ft putt then it blows 15ft off the green into the rough			0
then 4 putts that hole , " the 2012 @entity79 winner wrote .			0
