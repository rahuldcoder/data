@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's new coalition government has embarked on a budget - deficit cutting strategy that is bold , brave and potentially very risky , says analyst @entity6			1
it could turn out to be a model for the @entity9 to follow -- or a prime example of what not to do in the wake of a severe recession			0
after forming a government in the wake of the may election , the ruling coalition of conservatives and @entity16 announced plans last month to cut spending and raise taxes in an effort to reduce the budget deficit			1
@entity6 , the author and host of @entity2 's " @entity26 " spoke to @entity2 on wednesday from @entity0			1
here is an edited transcript : @entity2 : the new coalition government in @entity4 has announced major steps to cut the budget deficit			1
what has the impact been ? @entity6 : in general , i 'd say the government is benefiting from having announced these cuts			1
there 's a sense that they 're being bold , they 're being brave , they 're taking on a big challenge			2
it particularly helps them that you have this coalition government , so the fact that the @entity16 , who are really quite a left - wing party , are supporting the budget has given conservatives more cover			1
... it 's important to remember that it 's not just budget cuts , it 's also tax raises			0
you have to give them credit for being serious about this			0
it is not pure ideology as with the right in the @entity9			0
they understand that if you 're going to do something serious about the budget deficit , you 've got to do both spending cuts and tax increases			0
there 's simply no way for the math to work without doing that			0
now , on the political side though , these changes have not come into effect yet			0
so there are two big questions , what happens economically when these budget cuts start going into effect and what happens politically -- how popular does the government remain at that point ? but the biggest question is what happens economically			1
@entity2 : is it too soon to take these steps as the world is coming out of a big recession , and government spending is seen as a way to speed the recovery from a recession ? @entity6 : the crucial question here is about timing , and very few people would disagree that @entity4 had to get its public finances in order			1
there 's a universal sense that the last @entity99 government spent too much money and borrowed too much money			2
but in the midst of a very weak economic recovery , does it make sense to slash spending , raise taxes , all of which will have the effect of putting some people out of work and reducing people 's spending power			2
here 's the debate -- one side says that will reassure markets , that will bring interest rates on things like mortgages even lower , and that will give businesses confidence to invest , and the other side says once you inflict that much pain on the economy , people are going to spend less as people lose jobs or are taxed more heavily , which will cause an even more severe downturn			2
@entity2 : what does this mean for the rest of the world ? @entity6 : @entity4 is the guinea pig here			1
we 're all going to watch the outcome very closely because president @entity141 has taken a position in this debate			0
he told the @entity145 countries , which includes @entity4 of course , that it is too soon to start withdrawing the stimulus measures			2
@entity4 is going further than withdrawing the stimulus measures , it 's actually cutting spending			1
the big debate is over what will restore business confidence and what will make businesses start spending again			1
because everyone agrees that government spending is only a bridge to business spending			2
at some point business has to start spending again			0
i 'm pretty persuaded that the timing on this is bad			0
i think it would have made more sense to wait at least six months , if not nine to 12 months before beginning these measures			0
@entity2 : if you 're going to have to do it eventually , why wait ? @entity6 : it 's really quite brave of the @entity172 to take on the fiscal problem but there is definitely a danger that they are doing it too soon and will put the economy into a lower growth mode			1
this is something that you have to remember for the @entity9 as well			0
if you have lower growth , you also have a worse deficit because the biggest contributor to deficits is a decline in tax revenue			0
so the slower the economy grows , the fewer people who are employed , the lower the taxes going to the government treasury , the bigger and bigger the deficit becomes			2
so , in a strange sense , even to help the deficit in the short term , you need a little bit of government spending to get the economy going , to get people spending , to get them paying taxes			2
@entity2 : does @entity202 's victory in the @entity4 election tell us something about the future of conservatives in @entity9 ? @entity6 : outside @entity4 , people are struck by @entity202 , the fact that he 's become prime minister , that he 's fairly popular and he seems to be taking big , bold measures			1
but here people are still struck by how limited was the @entity172 victory , if you could call it a victory			2
after 13 years of @entity99 rule , when it would be only natural for the @entity172 to be given power for just cyclical reasons , after a very unpopular @entity99 prime minister and the worst economic crisis since the great depression , the conservatives still were not able to muster a majority and had to go into a coalition with the @entity16			1
@entity2 : why could n't the conservatives put together a majority in the election ? @entity6 : what thoughtful observers say was that the @entity172 still made no inroads in @entity231 , did not make many inroads with working women -- which is a growing part of the population -- and they did not make many inroads with nonwhite minorities , people from @entity238 , and @entity239 and the @entity240			1
as somebody put it to me , the @entity172 brand is still a tarnished brand			2
to me , that was a very interesting lesson for the right in @entity9			0
you can have the small government argument @entity202 was making			1
it did have a lot of appeal -- but to @entity1 , not @entity231 and not to the nonwhites in @entity1 either			0
it made me wonder about the @entity253 in the @entity9 , which of course has broader appeal , but still faces some of these same challenges			0
the midterm election looks like it 's going to go very well for the @entity253 because there is a lot of anti-incumbency sentiment and some anger at the @entity262			1
but to seal the deal , @entity253 need to close the gap with nonwhites and working women , and there , the @entity253 , like the @entity172 , still faces some challenges			1
@entity2 : what other lessons are there for conservatives in the @entity9 ? @entity6 : the @entity253 should really watch the @entity172			1
what @entity202 is trying to do is to modernize the @entity172			1
the @entity172 was seen in @entity4 as too right wing , too extreme and too intolerant in many ways and what he 's been trying to do is to broaden its appeal			1
@entity202 is more green , more environmentally active , than @entity276			0
he 's come out very strongly in favor of gay rights , he 's come out in favor of the @entity280			0
all of this is a signal that he 's not a conservative who 's going to completely destroy @entity1 's welfare state			0
in a sense , working with the @entity16 has been a godsend for @entity202			0
the fact that he 's in coalition with them means that when the far right of his party asks him to do something , he can say , i 'm sorry guys , i just ca n't do it because we 're in coalition with the @entity16 , and to keep the coalition together i have to moderate my stance			1
now there 's an interesting debate in @entity4 about whether he 's modernizing the @entity172 because he is himself a great moderate or because he just wants to win and he knows the center is where the electability is			1
in a sense it does n't matter for republicans watching it			0
you still need to be attractive to the center , to the younger generation , to working women and to ethnic minorities			0
of course it will all depend on how this economic experiment goes			0
if these cuts put @entity4 in a double - dip , you 'll see great strains on the coalition itself , and the @entity16 will find it difficult to stay in this coalition			2
then this whole thing spins out of control .			0

@entity4 's *aggressive* plan to cut its deficit is a bold but risky move , says @entity6
the coalition government has announced plans but they have n't gone into effect , he says
@entity6 : question is will it restore business confidence or cause recession
he says @entity253 should take note of how @entity202 is modernizing the @entity172
