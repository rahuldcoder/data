" their father is dead , " @entity11 responded			2
" i almost lost my daughter ! she is devastated			2
she tried to kill herself			0
she does n't feel she has a life anymore			0
" @entity10 , 15 , attempted suicide in early june and is still being treated in a facility for her emotional problems			0
jurors sitting for a 70th day of testimony in the wrongful death trial of @entity4 's last concert promoter have laughed loudly at times during the colorful testimony of @entity11 , who alternated between tears and jokes			1
when she and @entity4 divorced after their three - year marriage in 1999 , the singer " got custody of the doctors , " she joked wednesday			2
@entity11 returned to the witness stand thursday for a second day of testimony in the small @entity0 courtroom			2
she was ordered to testify about the singer 's drug use by lawyers for @entity39 , the concert promoter being sued by @entity4 's mother and three children			1
wednesday 's questioning by @entity39 lawyer @entity43 centered on @entity4 's use of prescription drugs -- to deal with pain from scalp surgery , and two times in @entity49 , where doctors used the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia			1
thursday 's testimony , however , began with @entity11 's description of @entity4 's skin problems , which included vitiligo -- a condition in which his pigment disappeared , leaving large white spots on his face , hands and body			1
" everyone says he bleached himself , but he did n't , " @entity11 said			1
many of his visits to dr. @entity68 , the @entity69 dermatologist where she worked for 18 years as a medical assistant , were to treat the condition , she testified			0
@entity4 compared himself to the " @entity73 , " a 19th - century @entity74 who became a circus sideshow curiosity because of severe disfigurements , she said			2
" he was worried that people would see the disease or the disfigurement before they would see him working sometimes , " @entity11 testified			2
he also suffered from discoid lupus , which made his skin tissue " mushy , " especially on his scalp , she said			0
@entity4 's scalp was severely burned during a pyrotechnics accident while he was filming a @entity87 commercial in 1984			1
@entity4 's insomnia struggle two @entity49 doctors treated @entity4 's insomnia with propofol 12 years before he died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic , @entity11 testified wednesday			1
dr. @entity94 -- @entity4 's general practitioner in the @entity96 -- arranged for the @entity49 anesthesiologists to infuse the singer with propofol in a @entity100 hotel in july 1997 after sedatives failed to help him sleep between concerts , @entity11 testified			1
" i think they tried it and it had n't worked , and if he could n't sleep , he could n't perform , " she testified			0
@entity4 " was at the end of his rope ; he did n't know what else to do			2
" he " felt better " after eight hours of propofol - induced sleep and decided to get a second treatment after his second @entity100 show , she said			0
@entity94 testified at the criminal trial of dr. @entity113 that he was never involved in propofol treatments for @entity4 and was not aware of the drug until much later			2
@entity11 backed away from her previous statement during a deposition , in which she said doctors also gave @entity4 propofol infusions in hotels in @entity122 during the @entity124 tour , in the late 1990s			1
@entity39 contends that @entity4 used propofol for years to treat his insomnia , including when @entity11 was traveling with him in @entity127 in the 1990s			1
the coroner ruled @entity4 died on june 25 , 2009 , from a propofol overdose administered by @entity113 , who is serving a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter			2
@entity39 executives , who were promoting and producing @entity4 's comeback concerts , had no way of knowing that @entity113 was infusing him with propofol each night for two months in the spring of 2009 , @entity39 lawyer @entity43 said in his opening statements 16 weeks ago			1
" almost no one knew until after his death , " @entity43 said			0
" @entity39 certainly did n't know about it			0
" the @entity141 's lawyers contend that the promoters ignored warning signs that @entity4 's health was deteriorating in the two months before his death			1
instead of getting him to another doctor who might have saved his life , they gave @entity113 the responsibility of getting @entity4 to rehearsals , they argue			0
@entity4 's mother , @entity150 , and three of her children contend @entity39 is liable in his death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised @entity113			1
the company 's agreement to pay @entity113 $ 150,000 a month put the doctor in a conflict of interest because he was in deep debt and could not risk losing the job by refusing @entity4 's demands for propofol , their lawyers contend			1
@entity39 argues that while its executives negotiated with @entity113 to serve as @entity4 's physician for the " @entity168 " tour , it was @entity4 who chose and controlled the doctor			1
" getting a grip ' on @entity4 's pain @entity4 underwent surgery in 1993 to repair burns suffered in the 1984 accident , including placement of a balloon under his scalp to stretch it over several months , @entity11 testified			1
his doctors " could n't get a grip of the pain " the procedure caused and two doctors " were having a pissing contest over who gave him the better drug , " she said			1
" @entity4 had a very low pain tolerance , and his fear of pain was incredible , " @entity11 testified			2
" and i think that doctors took advantage of him that way			0
" @entity11 said many of the doctors who treated @entity4 were " idiots , " including the dermatologist she worked for from 1979 until she quit in 1996 before she married @entity4			1
" @entity4 respected doctors immensely , that they went to school , that they studied ... to do no harm , " @entity11 said			1
" unfortunately , some of the doctors decided that when @entity4 was in pain or something that they would try to outbid on who could give him the better drug , and so he listened to those doctors			1
" @entity94 tailored a plan to help @entity4 withdraw from dependence on demerol , a powerful painkiller given him because of the scalp pain , she said			0
that plan , however , was derailed when @entity4 resumed traveling on his " @entity217 " tour , she said			0
after six weeks , when the tour reached @entity219 ( in autumn 1993 ) , @entity4 was " a hot mess , " she said			0
" he was depressed , " she said			0
" he had taken something			0
i do n't know what he had taken or who he had got it from			0
" after a three - day argument with @entity4 , @entity11 said , she convinced him to end his tour early and enter a drug rehabilitation program			1
" you need to straighten up , " she said she told @entity4			0
" you need to face whatever it is that is going on and we 'll get through this			0
" @entity4 eventually announced publicly that he was entering a rehab program to deal with an addiction to prescription drugs			0
@entity11 said @entity4 's drug use was not a secret among people in the " dangerous " tour production			1
@entity39 co-ceo @entity240 , who was the over the " @entity168 " production when @entity4 died , was also tour manager for the " @entity217 " tour			0
one revelation from @entity11 was that a @entity69 plastic surgeon faked doing a procedure on @entity4 on two occasions , although he told the singer he had done it			2
@entity4 complained about painful scars in his nose and went to dr. @entity252 to inject them with collagen , she said			0
" he put @entity255 out and did n't do anything but put tape on him as if he had treated him , " @entity11 testified			2
the doctor told her he did that because he could not find the scars @entity4 thought were there			0
thursday is the 70th day of testimony in the trial , which the judge told jurors would likely be given to them for deliberations in late september .			0
