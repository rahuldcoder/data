fourteen files , containing over 4,000 pages of @entity5 sightings from 1981 to 1996 , have now been placed on @entity11 's @entity19 database and are publicly available online			1
the sightings range from lights in the sky to close contact with aliens , and the files contain detailed analysis on some of the @entity11 's most popular cases -- a number of which remain officially unexplained			1
in one incident in 1995 , two men in their 20s from @entity33 , central @entity34 , told police they saw an alien with a lemon - shaped head descend from a hovering @entity5 and tell them " we want you ; come with us			1
" in another sighting recorded by defense officials in 1994 , two women at the @entity6 music festival reported seeing a @entity5 floating above the jazz stage however , 90 percent of cases have been accounted for			1
multiple sightings of a brightly illuminated oval object in @entity48 during 1993 and 1994 were later explained as an airship advertising the launch of the @entity52 car			0
in 1993 , more than 30 reports of illuminations over central @entity34 during a six - hour period led to senior defense staff being briefed , before it was established that the lights had been caused by a @entity59 rocket re-entering the atmosphere the documents reveal that in 1996 there were 608 sightings , a dramatic surge from the previous year 's 117			0
however , this may have less to do with exceptional levels of extra-terrestrial activity , than with the release of blockbuster film " @entity70 " and the popularity that year of sci - fi tv series " the x-files			1
" @entity74 , a @entity5 expert and journalism lecturer at @entity76 who has studied the files , said : " obviously , films and tv programs raise awareness of ufos and it 's fascinating to see how that appears to lead more people to report what they see			2
" @entity74 's comments certainly correspond with the other periods of high - frequency sightings in @entity11 -- one of the other busiest years was in 1978 , the same year in which @entity93 's alien - themed " @entity92 " was released			2
the files also shed new light on @entity11 's own ' @entity101 ' , the @entity98 sightings of december 1980 in which @entity95 air force men saw a series of mysterious lights in the trees at the perimeter of an air base used by the @entity107			0
the then government of @entity109 was quick to dismiss the incident , but a letter from a former chief of defense staff in 1985 warned that the affair could prove a ' banana skin ' for the @entity10			0
" the case has puzzling and disquieting features which have never been satisfactorily explained ... which continue to preoccupy informed sections of the public , " said the letter			0
other documents reveal a @entity5 incident in @entity122 between 1989 and 1990 when @entity122 @entity107 f - 16 fighters were scrambled to intercept abnormal , brightly - lit , triangular flying objects reported by police and others			2
in november 1993 general @entity128 , chief of operations in the @entity122 air staff , confirmed that the fighters had locked - on to something with their radar but were unable to explain what it was			0
the @entity10 affirmed that there had been no threat to the @entity11 and that it has never detected a " structured craft flying in @entity11 airspace that has remained unidentified			0
" this latest release of documents represents the fourth set of @entity5 files released since 2008 as part of a three - year project in conjunction with the @entity19 .			1
