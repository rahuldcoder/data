@entity0 -- despite protests outside his office and boycott threats , @entity3 's governor signed into law friday one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration measures enacted by an individual state			1
the measure , which gov. @entity12 inked about a month after it cleared the @entity14 - dominated @entity13 , allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in certain criminal investigations			1
@entity19 87 also imposes prison sentences of up to one year and fines of up to $ 1,000 for people who knowingly transport illegal immigrants during the commission of a crime			1
it also asserts that workers convicted of using fake identification to get jobs could be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $ 250,000			2
" this legislation is a responsible step forward in the absence of federal action , " @entity12 said after the bill signing			1
" illegal immigration places an incredible burden on @entity3 taxpayers			1
" as they have throughout the debate , leaders in the local @entity41 community railed against the measure			1
among them were several dozen people who demonstrated friday outside the governor 's office at the state @entity47 , chanting , " shame on you			0
" the legislation drew threats of lawsuits targeting the bill , as well as boycotts aimed at forcing the government 's hand			1
the group @entity57 on @entity59 is calling for a national boycott of conventions and vacation travel to @entity3 , while a blog entry on the website of the group @entity3 warned , " veto @entity19 87 or @entity66 ! it 's your choice , governor deal ! ! " " this is the beginning of a road that we 'll travel that will take a long time , " @entity70 , president of the @entity71 , said friday in @entity0			0
similar efforts have been pursued -- with some success -- targeting other states that have passed legislation aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration			2
nonetheless , anti-illegal immigrant bills can still be found from coast to coast			0
the @entity84 found that , in 2010 alone , more than 1,400 bills were introduced aiming to give individual states more of a role in immigration enforcement			1
of those measures , 208 laws were enacted , 10 were vetoed , and 138 resolutions were adopted			0
the best - known such effort was in @entity93			0
among other things , that legislation would have required local law enforcement officers in @entity93 to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants			1
the @entity98 sued , arguing that only the federal government has that authority			0
last month , a three - judge panel on the 9th @entity102 sided with the @entity98 and against gov. @entity103 , who signed @entity104 into law last year			2
@entity103 has asked the @entity106 to lift the court order that is blocking enforcement of parts of the law			1
@entity110 , the head of the advocacy group @entity111 , blasted what he called @entity3 's " odious piece of legislation			0
" he said it was a " copycat " of the @entity93 law and effectively legalizes " racial profiling			2
" " @entity3 's lawmakers have not learned from @entity93 's mistakes , " @entity110 said friday in a statement			0
" these laws presume everyone is guilty , contradicting the fundamental @entity124 presumption that those accused are innocent until proven otherwise			0
" the @entity127 government added friday that it " regrets " @entity130 's decision to sign the law			1
" the legislators and state executive ignored the many contributions of the immigrant community to the economy and society of @entity3 , " the @entity127 government said in a statement			1
but some who support the @entity3 legislation -- including @entity130 and @entity141 , a spokesman for the conservative group @entity142 -- said it is not about discrimination but rather about protecting taxpayers			0
" the illegal immigrants in our state have been swamping our hospitals and schools , " @entity141 said			2
" it 's a very expensive proposition			0
we just want to make sure that people are welcome here and that they come here legally			0
and then we can cut back on the illegal immigration			2
" president @entity156 's administration has opposed such state - specific measures , including fighting them in court , saying that having as many as 50 different immigration policies ( one for each state ) would be counterproductive from a law enforcement standpoint and damaging from an international relations standpoint			1
asked about @entity19 87 last month by @entity1 affiliate @entity164 , @entity156 defended the federal government 's actions			0
" the truth on the matter is we 've done more on enforcement than any previous administration , " the president said			2
" we have more border patrols ; we have had serious crackdowns on employers who are hiring undocumented workers			0
