-- the lines extended into the street at times , voters waiting to pick their choice to succeed @entity7 president @entity6			1
some 70 % of some 50 million registered voters -- men and women , young and old -- turned out according to state broadcaster @entity10 , to pick a man who 'll deal with high - stakes challenges domestically and internationally			1
and now the results are starting to trickle in			1
based on two sets of still very early results , centrist candidate @entity17 had more votes than any other candidate , @entity16 officials said early saturday			1
as of about 7:15 a.m. saturday ( 10:45 p.m. et friday ) , @entity17 had 834,859 votes ; @entity23 had 320,562 ; @entity24 had 257,822 ; @entity25 had 214,368 ; @entity26 had 106,144 ; and @entity27 had 25,324			1
even counted cumulatively , these votes represented a small fraction of the total vote			1
if the 70 % turnout figure is correct , there would be about 35 million votes ; the early results reflect about 1.76 million			1
when the final tally does come in , that does n't necessarily mean the election is over			1
if no single candidate gets more than half the vote , the top two finishers will face off in a runoff next friday , june 21			1
that victor will take @entity6 's mantle as one of the most visible figures , at a time it 's dealing with widespread sanctions tied to international anger over its nuclear program			2
but he wo n't be @entity7 's most powerful man : that distinction belongs to ayatollah @entity52 , who has been @entity7 's supreme leader since 1989			2
he 's got plenty of backing , from conservative citizens to paramilitary to , most notably of all , the @entity55			2
" whoever is president , he 's going to have his hands relatively tied by the @entity55 if they do n't really like what he 's doing , " said @entity56 , a policy analyst at the @entity57 think tank			2
centrist candidate complained of irregularities this reality of @entity7 governance , though , did n't prevent 680 men and women from officially seeking the office			1
the @entity69 -- a non-elected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader -- narrowed that group down to eight			0
two others subsequently dropped out			0
the final six contenders do n't include any women			0
nor do they include @entity6 's aide and protege @entity79 , who was among those excluded by the @entity69			0
@entity26 , @entity23 and @entity24 , who is @entity7 's chief nuclear negotiator , are considered close to @entity52 and would be unlikely to challenge his authority			0
of the three , @entity24 has seen the most popular support going into the vote			1
@entity17 , meanwhile , has the backing of the highly influential former president @entity87			1
hours into the voting , @entity17 had complained of a voting irregularity			1
a reform candidate , @entity90 , who dropped out of the race earlier in the week , is still on some ballots			1
@entity17 is worried that voters may mistakenly select @entity90 , which would amount to a vote thrown away			1
it was not clear how many ballot papers were concerned			0
@entity0 's view on the streets of @entity100 @entity7 's semi-official @entity101 reported via @entity102 that voting lines got longer in the afternoon , and that there were insufficient voting slips in some polling stations			0
@entity0 's @entity107 on 2013 vs. 2009 elections 2009 chaos images of bleeding and dying @entity7 flickered across social media four years ago after allegations of election fraud sparked protests and clashes			1
police and the @entity117 , a feared paramilitary group , cracked down on the protests			1
protesters were jailed , and human rights groups alleged many were tortured and killed behind bars while the government quashed the uprising			0
reform politicians representing the movement , including @entity6 's election rival , former prime minister @entity127 , have remained under house arrest			1
despite the unrest , @entity6 's re-election was formally certified by the clerical establishment			0
since his reelection , conservative politicians close to the supreme leader have assailed @entity6 for being too liberal , and he has often been at odds with @entity52			0
some of @entity6 's associates have faced heavy repression , and hardliners attempted to link the president to the largest embezzlement case in the country 's history			0
ahead of the vote this time round , campaigning was more muted although @entity52 's office repeated his call to the ballot boxes friday with posts on social networking site @entity102			2
" i humbly expect from our nation to participate all in # @entity154 & do this as soon as possible , " the supreme leader 's post said			2
voting is not mandatory in @entity7 , but there are major incentives to push people to the polls			0
an active voter has a better shot at promotions in the workplace and preference when it comes to collecting social welfare benefits			2
this can be vital in an economy that is chronically weighed down by international sanctions over nuclear concerns			0
@entity52 also tweeted a jab at the @entity173 , which has often led the charge to tighten those sanctions			0
" i have heard that # @entity176 said they do n't recognize # @entity177			0
hell with their recognition ! " he said			0
clampdown on dissent ? rights group @entity181 said this week that it was " concerned by evidence that the @entity7 authorities are intensifying their clampdown on dissent " in the run - up to the vote			1
" those targeted include political activists , journalists and other media workers , trade unionists , advocates of greater rights for @entity7 's religious and ethnic minorities , students and others			2
in many cases , the full reasons for arrest and detention are not known ; in others , those arrested have been brought before the courts on sweeping but vaguely worded charges , convicted and sentenced to prison terms , " it said			0
the head of language services for @entity210 , @entity211 , also complained thursday of " unacceptable harassment " of its staff and other independent journalists in @entity7			0
" the @entity210 is very concerned by the unprecedented levels of intimidation being suffered by families of @entity220 staff living in @entity7 in the final days of the presidential election campaign , " she said			2
" the harassment has included threats that relatives will lose jobs and pensions and be prevented from traveling abroad			0
for the first time the lives of @entity220 staff living in the @entity229 have also been threatened			0
" @entity7 's minister of culture and @entity232 , @entity231 , said more than 2,000 local reporters and 450 foreign journalists were covering the election in @entity7			2
the head of the @entity237 within the ministry , @entity236 , said the number of foreign reporters covering the presidential election had increased by about 15 % compared with four years ago			1
@entity0 's @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
