" they can not use us to batter the unions , to dismiss them or to say they have no respect for the victims			1
... ( the protest ) absolutely does not bother us , " she told @entity1 radio network @entity24 in response to criticisms , the unions have countered that some conservatives have shown a lack of respect for the victims -- which included many workers and students killed or maimed in the attacks -- by fomenting unfounded conspiracy theories about the bombings			1
