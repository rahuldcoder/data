@entity0 -- creating and saving jobs while boosting investment in the future are among the top goals of the @entity8 administration 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan			1
president @entity8 chats with students at a @entity11 , @entity12 , elementary school this week			0
and according to a preliminary report on stimulus funding for schools by the @entity17 and the @entity18 , the stimulus plan has created jobs			1
state governments have created and saved at least 250,000 education jobs -- and restored nearly all their projected education budget shortfalls for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 -- according to preliminary findings released monday by the @entity24			1
but some states that used the funds to fill existing budget gaps could face a crisis when the money runs out after 2010			1
and the @entity17 has chastised certain states for their stimulus funding programs and warned them that they risk their chances at getting other @entity34 grants down the road			1
the stimulus funds appropriated $ 48.6 billion for the @entity38 to help keep and create jobs and advance education reforms over a period of two years , the report said			1
the program dedicates $ 39.8 billion for public elementary , secondary and higher education and other services			0
another $ 8.8 billion will go for other activities such as public safety or government services			0
" to date , $ 35.5 billion of the @entity38 allotment has been obligated and $ 13.2 [ billion ] is forthcoming , " the report added			0
in a recent memo , the @entity17 's inspector general 's office warned @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 about not following the rules			0
at issue is the government 's " maintenance of effort " provision , which makes states receiving stimulus funds promise to maintain funding at fiscal year 2006 levels			1
the provision also requires states to pledge to use these funds to advance certain education reforms : increasing teacher effectiveness , implementing statewide data systems , and providing support for struggling schools			1
the september 30 memo pointed out states are using k - 12 stimulus funds to fill gaps in their education budgets due to decreasing revenues and resources			1
@entity56 's actions led to a terse letter on june 18 from education secretary @entity84 to gov. @entity85			0
the letter said : " if a @entity38 has disproportionately reduced its education budget and / or if a @entity38 has done nothing more than backfill budget holes with these dollars when the state had other resources available to it , such as a rainy - day fund , the @entity38 's competitive position to receive ... competitive grants may be negatively impacted			1
" those states employing the practice , some argue , will face dire straits in fiscal year 2011 when the stimulus funding runs out			1
" @entity102 and districts were repeatedly warned about funding [ problems ] , " said @entity100 , a policy analyst with the nonpartisan think tank @entity101			0
but @entity100 notes that there may have been a lack of communication between states and the federal government over how to spend the money			1
" they [ states ] were told to focus on one - time investments as much as possible , " he said			1
" at the same time , the @entity17 sold this as a job and reform package			0
... they say on one hand , preserve and create jobs			0
on the other hand , they talk about education reform			0
" the @entity8 administration argues the early results from monday 's report show the money already is having an effect			2
" this is one more indication of how the @entity132 is helping soften the blow of tough times , by keeping educators on the job and teachers in the classroom , " vice president @entity129 said in a statement			2
but there has been criticism over the way the government is handling and tracking the @entity132			2
" if these issues and the stimulus money being made available ... are not handled carefully , conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue , " said @entity143 , a professor at @entity144 and director of the @entity146 , in a recent @entity1 commentary			2
" the president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers			0
" @entity100 points out that some of the accountability problems seen with the @entity132 likely occurred during the time the federal government was doling out money to states			1
" the states were cutting employees that were designed to draft federal grants and to track and follow money as it flowed through [ at the same time the federal government was giving out stimulus funds ]			1
... they were cutting monitors and accountants that would have been able to follow this better , " he said			0
despite some of the accountability and tracking problems , @entity84 said early feedback from states " also tells us that many districts are using stimulus dollars in ways that will move us beyond the status quo			2
" and @entity84 's concept can be seen in school programs cited in monday 's report			0
@entity184 , superintendent of the @entity186 , @entity187 , schools , said the stimulus funding is not only helping to create jobs in the short term but also investing in the future after the funding is gone			2
" our philosophy has really been around making some investments in the short term to build our capacity so that those investments will continue to pay off in the long term around student achievement and learning , long after the dollars are gone , " he said			0
@entity203 's school district was cited in the stimulus report as a success story for facilitating greater inclusion of students with disabilities into the regular educational setting			2
the funds , according to the report , helped the district to add special education instructors in its middle and high schools , " while supporting needed training for teachers and aides who work with special education students			2
" @entity187 , @entity203 said , has been supportive in helping his school district plan and obtain stimulus money to " really invest in our people and hopefully invest in our kids for the long term			1
" the @entity17 report offered other examples that it said showed funding is working , such as : " in several communities these dollars are being used to enhance information systems to help measure progress by both teachers and students in meeting educational standards , " the report added			0
@entity240 's @entity239 contributed to this report .			0
