" it 's like survival of the fittest			1

authorities have sent police and military reinforcements to try to bring the situation under control			0
still , little aid was reaching victims , especially those in remote locations			2

the initial death toll projection of 10,000 was " too much , " president @entity75 told @entity2 's @entity77			2
he estimated that the final accounting would more likely be around 2,000 to 2,500			0
the toll from @entity10 -- known in the @entity1 as " @entity10 " -- grew to 1,833 dead and 2,623 injured , the @entity80 said wednesday			1

@entity154 : @entity10 's impact @entity75 defended the pace of relief to some of the hardest hit areas			1
