-- the day after an internal review blasted @entity2 for its handling of a child sex abuse scandal that implicated top administrators , including the school 's iconic head football coach , the board of trustees made it clear that a lucrative deal the university made with @entity11 that now benefits his estate will still stand			1
" contracts are contracts , " board of trustees chair @entity14 said friday during a trustee meeting in @entity17 , @entity18			1
" and no there 's no plan to ( change ) that			0
" renegotiations over @entity11 's contract began with university officials in january 2011 , according to a source , the same month that @entity11 testified before a grand jury about what he knew of child sex abuse accusations against @entity31 , a former assistant coach on the football team			1
ten months later , @entity31 was arrested			0
he was convicted last month of sexually abusing children over a 15 - year period , with much of the abuse occurring on the @entity2 campus			2
according to the university website , @entity11 's amended contract was finalized in august 2011 and totaled $ 5.5 million in payouts and benefits , which included a $ 3 million bonus and title as head football coach emeritus if he retired at the end of the 2011 season			1
the package , which was published online in april , also included a $ 425,000 head coach bonus , $ 900,000 in television and radio revenue , $ 250,000 in debt forgiveness , use of the university 's luxury box , use of the school 's hydrotherapy equipment and $ 1,000 monthly payment to @entity11 's wife for the rest of her life , among other benefits			1
both former university president @entity66 and former vice president @entity67 were involved in the renegotiation , while the board of trustees as a whole had been left out of the loop until november when @entity31 was arrested , a source told @entity0			2
@entity66 was fired after the grand jury presentment against @entity31 came to light while @entity73 was charged along with former athletics director @entity74 with lying to a grand jury and failure to report suspected child abuse			1
after being " bombarded with hate mail and threatened with a defamation lawsuit " following @entity11 's firing over the scandal , the board eventually approved @entity11 's new contract , according to the @entity80 , which first reported the story			1
" board members who raised questions about whether the university ought to go forward with the payments were quickly shut down , " the newspaper reported			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm those accounts			0
former fbi director @entity92 released the results of the university - funded probe on thursday , reporting that his team of investigators had found that several school officials had " empowered " @entity31 to continue his abuse			2
@entity11 also could have stopped the attacks had he done more , @entity92 concluded			0
" our most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of @entity31 's child victims by the most senior leaders at @entity2 , " @entity92 wrote			2
the 267 - page review implicated @entity66 , @entity73 and @entity74 in the scandal , but is separate from a government investigation into the charges of perjury and failure to report abuse against @entity73 and @entity74 , whose attorneys blasted the report , calling it a " lopsided document " that did not have access to critical witnesses			0
@entity122 , a lawyer for the @entity11 family , could not be immediately reached for comment saturday			0
the former head coach died of lung cancer in january at the age of 85			0
on saturday , a halo that had been painted above @entity11 after he died was removed from a @entity130 , @entity18 , mural titled " @entity131			1
" meanwhile , @entity31 is awaiting sentencing on his abuse convictions			2
@entity0 's @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0

contract negotiated amid grand jury *testimony* in the @entity31 scandal will stand
" contracts are contracts , " board of trustees chair says
an internal @entity2 probe found @entity11 could have done more to stop the abuse
a @entity130 mural is altered to remove halo from @entity11 's image
