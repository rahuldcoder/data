-- to the devout , the concept of becoming " muslim for a month " -- or any other religion , for that matter -- could verge on the sacrilegious			2
" it 's a provocative title , ' @entity11 , ' so we were bracing ourselves for ( criticism ) , " said @entity7 , who runs cultural exchange programs with that name			1
the tours take non-muslims from around the world into @entity18 mosques and homes for a first - hand experience of @entity21			1
" there has been a little of that -- ' being a @entity11 is for life , not just a month , " he added			1
but overwhelmingly , he said , the response from @entity28 has been positive because the tours help to dispel negative stereotypes about the religion and leave participants with an enriched spiritual perspective			1
" people are very visibly moved , " @entity7 said			0
" there 's lots of tears			0
it 's a rich , multi-layered experience and people are coming out with changed ideas and changed perceptions -- they are more aware of the positive side of the religion than before			0
" @entity11 for a month , run by @entity44 , is part of a new breed of cultural immersion tourism being dubbed " pray - cations			1
" it promises travelers a rich , meaningful experience , by exposing them to religious beliefs and practices " in a country where spirituality is still very much alive , " he said			0
bowler , a @entity59 - based @entity58 , has run half a dozen of the tours in recent years , during which participants are taught the basics of @entity21 practice , study @entity21 history and calligraphy , pray in mosques and live and eat with @entity11 families			1
the itinerary also includes a day of fasting			0
during the 10 - day or 21 - day tours ( the " month " in the tour name is slightly misleading , organizers admit ) , tour members stay in a 400 - year - old @entity77 lodge in @entity80 's @entity79 district , visit the ancient city of @entity82 to visit the tomb of @entity84 , and admire the ecstatic services of the whirling dervishes who follow his teachings			1

@entity97 , who lived in 13th century , was " somebody who , during a time of ethnic tensions , was able to hit a very high note of love and tolerance and acceptance that we want to hold up as relevant today , " he added			0
@entity106 , a 56 - year - old @entity107 social worker and convert to @entity108 , took part in one of the tours on the recommendation of her son			2
he had been on one himself , and given her a book on @entity97 , as he believed it would resonate with her			0
she said the course gave her a deeper understanding , both of @entity21 , " as a systematic way to get closer to @entity120 , " and of herself			1
the rituals of @entity21 , she said , helped her in her quest to resolve the " inner conflict between individuality and community			1
" it also emphasized the connections between all people -- whatever their faith			0
" @entity97 loved people , not because of what they did or showed , but because he saw the little flame in their heart that waits to be illuminated , " she said			0
" i was born in @entity135 , baptized @entity136 and converted to @entity108 ... if i had been born in @entity18 , i might have been @entity11			1
if i had been born in @entity59 , i might have been @entity137			0
does it matter ? " @entity140 - @entity106 's experience reflected the aims of the course , which were twofold , said bowler : to correct the current " low pr of @entity21 itself , and religion in general			2
" he hopes the tours will promote " global understanding " by establishing direct contact between outsiders and the @entity11 world			1
" so many of our ideas are formed through second - hand information , " he said			0
" we 're wanting this to be an example of first - hand experience , which makes people 's preconceptions fall away			0
" @entity7 also wishes for the tours to encourage participants in " the search for spirituality " in an increasingly secular world			1
" i 'm from @entity58 , my wife is @entity107 , so we 're both from very secular backgrounds , and it feels like we might be missing out on something , " he said			0
" it 's ( a ) living , breathing religious experience just being on the tour			2
we hope they go away not just with a broader understanding of @entity21 , but with a broader personal spiritual perspective as well			1
" no participants had converted to @entity21 , he said , although that was not something the tours particularly sought to encourage			1
he said that typically , the most challenging aspect of @entity21 life for tourists was the segregation between the genders , particularly given that some tours were 70 % women			1
" but most of our participants come away realizing it 's part of the culture and that these women are n't subjugated -- they 're often living their lives happily , " he said			2
see also : the story of @entity193 as it 's never been told before religion is always a sensitive subject , and the tours have faced some resistance			2
the group 's @entity199 page has been targeted with derogatory @entity202 comments by the far - right @entity203 , while some travel agents have been reluctant to promote the tours due to unease about @entity21 , said @entity7			1
meanwhile , some @entity28 have expressed discomfort with their all - encompassing faith being treated as something that can be dipped into as a touristic experience			2
but @entity7 , who has also run " @entity215 for a month " tours with @entity217 , and is launching an " @entity214 " tour in @entity18 focusing on the three @entity213 faiths , believes there is nothing wrong with the tour 's approach to religion			1
" we might be the first generation that gets to experience a variety of religions , " he said			0
" i grew up in an @entity228 family where my dad was @entity228 because his dad was catholic and that was as much thought that went into it			0
" these days we 're blessed to be able to experience @entity234 or @entity21 or @entity235 or whatever it might be and to take the values and the meanings we find and apply them to life			2
" i see a remarkable opportunity we have being alive today to be able to go and benefit from the various traditions ... by taking what makes sense to the individual			0
