-- family members of thousands of @entity2 who were killed or who disappeared are suing @entity5 , alleging the produce company is liable because of its payments to paramilitaries			1
" we 're holding them accountable , " said @entity9 , a @entity10 - based attorney who is handling cases for family members of more than 2,000 victims			1
@entity5 counters their claims and says the lawsuits should be dismissed			1
the company , which had more than 200 banana farms in @entity2 before selling them in 2004 , argues that it was a victim of extortion and has no responsibility for any crimes armed groups committed			1
a federal judge in @entity27 is weighing whether the lawsuits , which constitute more than 4,000 claims against @entity5 , will go to trial			1
in 2007 , @entity5 pleaded guilty and paid a $ 25 million fine for violating @entity33 antiterrorism laws when it provided payments to the right - wing paramilitary @entity35 , known as the @entity35			1
but family members and representatives of people killed by paramilitaries say the criminal case settlement was n't enough			0
" this is a something entirely distinct , the reparations that ( @entity5 ) must make for the victims that suffered the consequences of the armed groups , " said @entity41 , a @entity2 lawmaker and victims ' advocate			1
@entity5 spokesman @entity49 said the civil lawsuits are " entirely without merit			1
" " @entity5 gave in to the extortion demands only to protect its employees from being kidnapped and killed , " he said in a written statement			2
" once the company became aware that these payments could potentially violate @entity33 law , the company voluntarily disclosed the facts to the government and cooperated fully with the government 's investigation			2
" the lawsuits , however , allege that the company knew it was funding terrorism			0
a lawsuit @entity9 filed on behalf family members of 677 victims in march alleged that @entity5 officials " were aware that their acts and omissions assisted in the violations of international law " and " acted willfully , wantonly and recklessly , with the intent to aid the terrorist acts of the @entity35			2
" under the guise of protecting the @entity2 public from leftist rebel groups , the @entity35 committed numerous human rights abuses , according to the @entity80 and @entity81			0
the abuses included " the massacre of hundreds of civilians , the forced displacement of entire villages and the kidnapping of political figures to force recognition of @entity35 demands , " then - @entity33 secretary of state @entity82 said in 2001 , when he designated the group a terrorist organization			0
in their criminal case , federal prosecutors accused the @entity97 - based company of paying more than $ 1.7 million to the @entity35 in two parts of @entity2 where the company grew bananas			2
as part of those proceedings , @entity5 acknowledged that it had also made payments to the leftist @entity104 -- known as the @entity104 -- from 1989 to at least 1997			2
at least one pending lawsuit -- also filed by @entity9 -- seeks damages from @entity5 for hundreds of killings and disappearances related to the @entity104			0
it is unclear when @entity33 district judge @entity110 will rule on whether the cases will go to trial , @entity9 said			1
in a motion filed this month asking the judge to dismiss the lawsuits , @entity5 argued that the suits did not show any connection between @entity5 and violence in @entity2 " apart from the one fact that @entity5 has admitted -- that it authorized its @entity2 subsidiary to accede to the extortion demands of right - wing and left - wing armed groups in @entity2 in order to prevent retaliation against its employees			1
" if the lawsuits go to trial , @entity9 said it is impossible to estimate the damages that could be awarded , but he said he hopes it will be a large figure that stops similar situations from occurring in the future			0
" these kinds of lawsuits raise the price - tag for them ( @entity5 )			0
these are not completely powerless people who if they 're killed , it does n't matter , and nobody can do anything about it , " @entity9 said			0
" it does matter , because they can sue for billions of dollars			0
" @entity0 's @entity143 and journalist @entity144 contributed to this report .			0
