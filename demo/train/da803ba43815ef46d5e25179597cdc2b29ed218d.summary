-- it has become a great @entity3 tradition , an act of small - town civics , an example of direct democracy in action where citizens get to meet presidential candidates multiple times			1
but it is also an overhyped media circus , which helps give @entity14 disproportionate influence on who gets the @entity18 nomination , despite the fact that no binding delegates are actually selected			1
the @entity14 caucuses are low - turnout , high - intensity elections			1
there are 2.1 million registered voters in @entity14			1
but the total turnout for the @entity18 caucus in 2008 was just 118,696 people , despite the months of media hype			0
@entity30 won the caucuses that year with nearly 41,000 votes , beating @entity33 by more than 10,000 votes while being outspent considerably			1
that 10,000 - vote margin represented less than half of 1 % of the entire state 's electorate			1
overall , the state of @entity14 is representative of heartland @entity3 -- 37 % registered independent , 32 % @entity40 and 30 % @entity18			1
but caucus - goers do not represent that political spread			0
instead , 88 % of @entity18 caucus voters in 2008 identified themselves as " conservative , " and only 11 % described their views as moderate			0
nearly two - thirds were evangelical			0
as a result , center - right @entity18 candidates who might have the best chance of winning @entity14 in a general election have a hard time making inroads in the conservative caucuses			1
conventional wisdom states that the top three finishers in the @entity14 caucuses are all winners , with a chance to win the nomination , especially if they exceed expectations			1
but jowly former sen. @entity59 came in third in @entity14 and dropped out of the campaign			2
@entity61 gained the endorsement of the @entity63 in 2008 as well as the nomination , but he did n't finish in the top three in ' 08 or ' 00			0
in fact , since 1980 , the only @entity18 nonincumbent who has won the caucuses and gone on to win the presidency is @entity70			2
this year , we have a real horse race with no clear leader -- polls say establishment candidate @entity33 is in pole position , followed closely by libertarian @entity76 and the surging social conservative @entity77			1
@entity80 's once commanding lead has been shrunk by more than $ 2 million in negative ads , most from a @entity33 - affiliated pac			1
@entity83 's invested his considerable campaign cash in a combination of in - state ad - buys and ground - game organization			1
@entity89 's campaign , which once was strong enough to win a straw poll in the state , has collapsed under the weight of the candidate 's considerable overreach , marked by high - level defections and rock - bottom polls			1
@entity89 has taken to desperately trying to compare herself to @entity97 at every stop while her campaign cites the judgment of a conservative @entity102 group that she is " biblically qualified to be president " -- whatever that 's supposed to mean			0
one of the real questions in this caucus is whether retail politics matters as much as it used to			0
@entity33 basically dissed the state for the first 10 months of 2011 , still stinging from his expensive rejection in 2008			2
but his well - funded campaign was able to buy aspects of a statewide organization and negative ads to tear down rivals			0
one of the fascinating aspects of the @entity33 campaign is that he seems to have a glass ceiling of 25 % -- the same percent of the caucus vote he received in 2008			1
the other candidates have famously traded the other 75 % of the vote over the past several months			0
if the deck is shuffled just right , with a number of other candidates in the mid-teens , @entity33 can win @entity14 in this crowded conservative field			1
and if he wins @entity14 on tuesday night , his months - long double - digit lead in @entity129 will solidify and he will be almost assured of winning the first two states , well on the way to winning the nomination			1
additionally , he has the weight of precedent on his side : the front - runners who have conventional wisdom behind them tend to win the @entity18 nomination eventually , after the party flirts with a dark horse			2
but @entity76 is a wild card			0
his supporters are by far the most dedicated , if not the most numerous			0
they will turn out come sleet or snow ( though the temperature is supposed to be above average )			0
the january 3 caucuses are smack in the middle of winter break for universities , but @entity76 's younger supporters might just come back early to vote for their hero			2
if @entity77 's recent momentum continues , he can claim the evangelical mantle as the consistent social conservative alternative to @entity33 , the man he endorsed in 2008			2
he provides at least one other clear point of contrast -- @entity77 has been hammering away at middle class and blue collar issues , while @entity33 embodies the one percent of the wealthiest @entity3			2
the most dire scenario for @entity33 would be a @entity80 or @entity83 surprise surge , which the polls say seems unlikely			1
but either of their campaigns could come out of @entity14 with new momentum and at least a real chance of winning @entity168 and possibly @entity169			2
three out of four states by the end of january makes a candidate extremely likely to win the party 's nomination			0
the countdown to the @entity14 caucus can now be measured in hours , instead of weeks or months			0
whatever you think about the disproportionate influence this heartland state has on our politics , it can not be ignored			0
the presidential election year of 2012 is here			0
and on tuesday night , the race for the @entity186 will really kick off			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

the 2012 presidential race begins tuesday with @entity14 caucuses
@entity189 says the caucuses are low - turnout , high - intensity elections
he says worst case for @entity33 would be a surprise surge by @entity80 or @entity83
@entity189 : @entity33 could win with only a quarter of the vote
