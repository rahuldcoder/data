behind a @entity1 shop front in the @entity3 heartland of @entity5 's @entity4 hides an urban agriculture initiative that claims to be the world 's first farm in a shop			1
the aptly - named farm : shop sits along a busy main road next to a ragtag bunch of more conventional retail outlets , most of which are in various phases of decay			2
there are chickens grazing on the rooftop -- seemingly oblivious to the red double decker buses roaring past below			0
inside are fish tanks filled with @entity23 ; mushrooms sprouting in the basement ; fruit blooming in a polytunnel greenhouse ; and endless rows of herbs and salad leaves growing from the hydroponic troughs that line the shelves			1
" i think places like farm : shop can reconnect people with their food , " says engineer and co-founder @entity33			1
" we 've had this separation of countryside and city living ... so the connection has been severed between what you eat and how it 's grown			2
" while the ethos is community focused , the shop 's interior is more like a laboratory than a local gardening center			2
white low - energy strip lights facilitate the growth of vegetables in lieu of sun rays , and the cabbage patch looks more like a cluster of giant @entity61 dishes than an allotment			0
" we 've been learning as we go with most of this technology , " admits @entity33			0
that said , the shop -- which opened in 2011 -- is already a modest commercial success			0
having diversified into a grocery store , cafe , rentable office and events space , it now employs two staff and is turning a profit -- all of which is ploughed back into the business			0
" we 've experienced a great amount of goodwill and enthusiasm about the project			0
people just want to come off the street , learn how to raise a fish ; look after a chicken ; grow some food -- and that means you get a more people - powered agriculture , " says @entity33			1
infographic : the secret life of drinking water while few would contest the rehabilitative social value of projects like @entity10 : shop , its founders argue it could be the start of something much more : a radical new approach to ecologically sustainable agriculture			1
" if you 're growing food directly where it 's eaten , there 's less refrigeration ... less energy use through transport and distribution , " claims @entity33			1
he says farm : shop could be scaled up and replicated in cities around the world to help reduce the enormous carbon emissions linked to food production			1
it 's a pressing issue			0
according to a 2008 @entity118 report , the food industry is responsible for creating 30 % of the world 's total annual carbon emissions			1
" the dominant food production system is based on fossil fuel at every level , " says dr @entity121 , professor of food and @entity123 at @entity5 's @entity124			1
" it needs oil to make the fertilizer ; oil for the farm ; oil for the food processing ; oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops , " he adds			2
among these stages , transport , processing and packaging account for the lion 's share of pollutants			0
the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) estimates that between 65 % to 85 % of food - related emissions in the @entity147 is created once produce has left the farm			1
" this is why these type of projects are much more than feel - good gimmicks , they are absolutely vital as part of a diverse array of sustainable agriculture systems that we must pursue further , " says @entity149 , the @entity145 's special rapporteur on the right to food			1
for @entity161 , the fact that food is often produced thousands of miles away from where most people live represents an irrational system , both from an ecologic and economic perspective			0
" rising fuel prices and the increasing concentration of the population in urban areas is bringing about serious logistical problems for the delivery of food , " he says			2
" traffic congestion , high refrigeration costs and , after all that , poor quality produce			0
" food destined for the @entity180 alone travels 30 billion kilometers a year -- adding 19 million tonnes of co2 to the atmosphere -- according to international development agency @entity183			0
it 's also easy to overlook the damage inflicted on local ecosystems and economies -- a large portion of which are in the developing world -- as a consequence of current industrial - scale agriculture practices			1
" the system is not working , " says @entity194 , chairman of the food for @entity196			0
" @entity199 agribusiness disrupts natural resource management with its demand for monoculture crops , synthetic packaging and habitat contamination from factory waste			0
" read related : farm in the city could be supermarket of the future both @entity194 and @entity149 agree that , even on a vastly escalated scale , initiatives like farm : shop are unlikely to resolve the food sustainability issue by themselves			1
" right now , no - one is saying you 're going to feed nine billion people like this , " says @entity194			0
" but agriculture reform is an incremental process requiring many solutions -- and growing perishable , fresh produce near to where it 's consumed seems like one very sensible step			1
" back in east @entity5 , @entity33 is optimistic about the future			2
" farm : shop itself is experimental , it will always be our laboratory at the heart of our ideas			2
but going forward we 'll be looking at bigger sites , scaling up , growing more food and selling more food together -- and if we get those kind of sites we 're really confident we can roll this out and make a real lasting difference			0
