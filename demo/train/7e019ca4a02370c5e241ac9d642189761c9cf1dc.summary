the @entity5 crisis escalated friday			1
a @entity7 official confirmed to @entity8 that armed @entity7 drones started flying over @entity10 in the previous 24 hours to provide additional protection for 180 @entity7 military advisers in the area			1
until now , @entity7 officials had said all drone reconnaissance flights over @entity5 were unarmed			1
using the drones for any offensive strikes against insurgent @entity18 in @entity5 and @entity21 fighters would continue to require approval from @entity7 president @entity23			1
also on friday , @entity25 leader @entity24 said disputed areas in northern @entity5 , including the oil - rich city of @entity3 , are part of the @entity25 autonomous region from now on after the @entity5 central government failed to hold a long - awaited referendum			1
earlier this month , the @entity5 army withdrew from @entity3 and @entity35 forces took control of the city and small villages in the areas as @entity40 carried out a lightning offensive and took several cities in northern @entity5			1
@entity24 : ' we have waited for more than 10 years ' the move could complicate efforts by the @entity7 and its allies to get @entity5 leaders to form a new government representing all three major population groups -- sunnis , shias and @entity25			1
@entity24 , the president of the @entity52 , cited the failure by the @entity5 government to hold a constitutionally mandated referendum on the status of @entity3 and nearby villages			1
" we have waited for more than 10 years for the @entity5 federal government to address and solve the issue of these areas covered by @entity65 , but it was of no avail , " @entity24 said at a joint appearance with @entity60 foreign secretary @entity59			1
according to @entity65 of the 2005 @entity69 , which was drawn up two years after the ouster of @entity5 leader @entity71 , a referendum would determine the final status of several disputed areas such as @entity3 and small villages in @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 claimed by the central government and the @entity52 regional government			1
however , the vote never took place because of instability in most of the disputed areas			0
@entity84 : how to understand the @entity5 crisis the news came on the same day that @entity87 said two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of @entity5 soldiers , police and civilians killed by the @entity40 fighters and their militant allies have been discovered in @entity71 's hometown of @entity96			1
claims of atrocities by both sides have increased as the conflict widens in @entity5			1
reports of killings ' deeply alarming ' earlier friday , @entity103 released a report saying it has evidence pointing to a pattern of " extrajudicial executions " of @entity40 detainees by government forces and @entity111 militias in the northern @entity5 cities of @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			2
" reports of multiple incidents where @entity40 detainees have been killed in cold blood while in the custody of @entity5 forces are deeply alarming , " said @entity116 , @entity103 's senior crisis response adviser , who is currently in northern @entity5			2
" the killings suggest a worrying pattern of reprisal attacks against @entity50 in retaliation for @entity40 gains			0
" meanwhile , witnesses said gunmen shot down an @entity5 military helicopter with an anti-aircraft weapon placed on a truck near @entity134 in @entity96 , about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) north of @entity10			1
the @entity5 @entity135 denied the helicopter was shot down			2
prime minister : we needed @entity7 jets the developments follow news that prime minister @entity142 told @entity60 broadcaster @entity144 that @entity40 advances may have been avoided if @entity5 had proper air cover in the form of fighter jets the country has been trying to secure from the @entity7 for some time			1
" i 'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract " with the @entity7 , @entity142 told the @entity144 in an interview this week that was released early friday			2
@entity5 has now turned to @entity152 and @entity153 to buy fighter jets , he said			1
" @entity156 willing , within one week , this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists ' dens , " he said			0
@entity5 ambassador @entity159 told @entity8 's " @entity164 " that his nation appreciated the help it has received from @entity162 but now faces " an immediate threat			2
" " we do n't have the luxury of waiting ; we need the support now , " @entity159 said			0
@entity7 and @entity170 diplomats tell @entity8 that the @entity7 is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against @entity40 and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in @entity5			1
but that is unlikely to happen quickly			0
@entity175 resumes tuesday , and @entity142 's political party controls 90 seats , the largest block of seats in parliament after april 's elections			0
to form a government requires a majority of at least 165 seats			0
@entity23 has promised @entity5 the aid of 300 @entity7 military personnel to advise and train @entity5 's security forces after a near collapse in the face of the lightning isis advance in northern and western @entity5			1
but there have been no @entity7 airstrikes , something that @entity5 's military commanders have said is desperately needed			1
claims of prisoner executions at the same time , disturbing claims have surfaced , with detainees and relatives of those killed providing graphic accounts that suggest @entity5 forces killed @entity40 detainees before withdrawing from @entity113 and @entity114			2
both cities are under the control of @entity40 , and @entity5 security forces and @entity111 militias have been battling isis and militant allies in @entity115			2
" even in the midst of war there are rules that must never be transgressed			0
" killing prisoners is a war crime			0
the government must immediately order an impartial and independent investigation into the killings , and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice			0
" @entity219 , spokesman for @entity5 's @entity220 that oversees the country 's judicial system , said the government knew of the @entity103 allegations but had yet to see any evidence			2
" at this stage , this is all just media reporting , " he told @entity8 on friday			0
" no witnesses have come forward , and no families have come forward with such claims			0
no one has officially asked for an investigation			0
" he called for the rights group to provide evidence , saying that " we are still monitoring and checking , and we will keep checking , " adding that " under @entity5 law , we can not move on it without claims and evidence			2
" using satellite imagery and publicly available photographs purportedly released by @entity40 , @entity87 says it appeared that @entity40 fighters in @entity96 executed three groups of men a short distance from former @entity5 leader @entity245 on the banks of the @entity248			1
" the analysis suggests that @entity40 killed between 160 and 190 men in at least two locations between june 11 and 14 , " the rights group said in its report			0
" the number of victims may well be much higher , but the difficulty of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation			0
" from the photographs posted online by @entity40 , it appeared the fighters killed the men at the site in at least three groups			0
" the photographs show one group of men lying in one trench and a second group of men lying on top of the first			0
a third group of men is seen lying in a second trench , " the group said			0
@entity87 says the photographs show a third mass grave , but investigators have been unable to find it			0
