@entity0 offered her firm backing thursday of president @entity3 's plan to issue an executive action to overhaul the nation 's immigration system			1
" i support the @entity14 decision to begin fixing our broken immigration system and focus finite resources on deporting felons rather than families , " @entity7 said in a statement emailed to reporters after @entity3 finished his prime time address on the topic			1
" i was hopeful that the bipartisan bill passed by the @entity21 in 2013 would spur the @entity22 to act , but they refused even to advance an alternative			0
" @entity7 went on to argue that although @entity26 was n't able to " finish the job by passing permanent bipartisan reform , " she is " confident that people of good will and good faith can yet find common ground			2
" shortly after the speech ended , @entity7 sent a tweet with a similar message			2
" thanks to @entity38 for taking action on immigration in the face of inaction , " she tweeted			0
" now let 's turn to permanent bipartisan reform			0
# @entity44 " the fact that @entity7 -- the prohibitive favorite for the @entity48 ' nomination in 2016 -- sent a paper statement on the issue is in itself telling			1
since leaving the @entity51 in early 2013 , @entity7 has rarely issued statements to reporters in favor of using her high profile speeches to address issues in the news			1
but immigration has been an issue that followed @entity7 for much of the last year			1
after telling @entity63 earlier this year that she would support looking at deportations for immigrant children coming to the @entity67 , the former secretary of state 's appearances became frequent venues for immigration protests			1
" i think it should be looked at as part of an overall package , " she told @entity63 in july			0
in @entity74 and then again a few days later in @entity75 , protesters interrupted @entity7 's stump speech to call for her to come out against deportations			2
" choose families over politics , " read one sign in @entity75			0
the protesters were usually from @entity81 we dream , a pro-immigration reform group			0
@entity7 responded in @entity75 by stating that immigration is an " important issue			1
" " if they would have just waited a little while , i was getting to the @entity88 , " @entity7 said			0
" i am really proud to be in a state who has opened the doors of opportunity to students who work and study hard regardless of their parents immigration status			0
