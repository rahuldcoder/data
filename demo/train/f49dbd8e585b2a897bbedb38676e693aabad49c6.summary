-- cholera is an intestinal infection that 's rare in the @entity3 currently			1
but in the developing world it 's a serious problem , with 3 to 5 million cases every year worldwide , according to the @entity7			1
the disease brings on diarrhea , which can kill a person if he or she is not properly hydrated			1
a tremendous advance in hydration was invented by @entity14 , along with his colleague @entity15			1
@entity14 was working in @entity16 during a cholera epidemic in 1968 , when intravenous solutions were the only treatment			1
he knew that an oral method of rehydration would be much more accessible and cost - effective for the people who needed it most			2
this idea had been around before			0
other doctors had tried oral methods but failed because they had the wrong proportions , and because they were focused on trying to give every person the same " magic bullet " dosage of therapy			0
@entity14 recognized that the volume of oral rehydration therapy required is n't the same for every patient			1
individual losses need to be replaced with equal volumes of the absorbable solution			2
what exactly did he deliver to patients ? essentially , a mixture of salt , water and sugar in the right proportions			0
this simple idea has saved millions of lives -- not just from cholera , but from any diarrhea			2
the @entity49 , a prestigious @entity51 medical journal , called this " potentially the most important medical advance of this century			0
" " the devastating conditions suffered by the @entity16 refugees as they fled the war with @entity56 offered @entity57 ( oral rehydration therapy ) its definitive test , " according to an august 2003 paper published in the journal @entity62			0
" when the medical team ran out of intravenous fluids at the camp , oral glucose - salt packets were used to treat ( more than ) 3,000 patients , resulting in a reduction in the mortality rate from 30 % to only 3.6 % , " the journal said			0
@entity0 's @entity70 contributed to this report .			0

there are 3 to 5 million cases of cholera every year
it can kill those who are n't properly hydrated
@entity14 developed the rehydration solution in 1968
