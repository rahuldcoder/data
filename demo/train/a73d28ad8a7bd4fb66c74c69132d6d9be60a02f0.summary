-- members of the law enforcement community must sound their voices in support of comprehensive immigration reform for the sake of public safety and for the sake of our country			1
i write this as a former police chief in @entity14 , @entity15 , who now serves as the district attorney of @entity17			2
i am an immigrant who came to the @entity19 from @entity20 at age 13 , as my family sought democracy and freedom			0
i cherish the history and values of our nation and hope that @entity30 , as it debates immigration reform , will courageously embody the best of our country , enact a humane solution to bring 11 million unauthorized immigrants out of the shadows and fully integrate them into @entity19 society			1
in the absence of federal action , states have taken immigration law into their own hands , implementing laws that drive a wedge between law enforcement and the people we are sworn to serve			2
a new study commissioned by @entity47 found that 45 % of @entity48 in @entity50 's @entity49 , @entity52 's @entity51 , @entity53 and @entity55 's @entity54 were less likely to report crime because they fear police will inquire about their immigration status			1
more disturbing is that 70 % of undocumented immigrants surveyed reported they are less likely to contact police if they are victims of crime			0
when immigrants -- unauthorized or authorized - feel isolated from the protection of law enforcement , the entire community suffers			2
i saw this evidenced during my tenure as police chief in @entity14 , @entity15 , where local sheriff @entity72 's reign of terror over the @entity74 community led to increased crime rates in his county			1
@entity72 blamed most crimes in @entity78 on undocumented immigrants and made racial profiling a common practice			0
he frequently detained people who " looked @entity74 " until they could prove their status in the country			0
in direct contrast to this approach , i worked side by side with community groups and civil rights organizations to foster a sense of trust between the @entity74 community and the @entity94			0
the effects of a broken immigration system were a constant thread in the stories of @entity74 mothers , fathers and workers who refused to report crime for fear of being detained or deported			0
in @entity14 , we lowered crime by some 30 % , according to @entity108 data -- a result of the trust our police department created with all communities , and not because of immigration enforcement			1
law enforcement should focus on community safety , not enforcing immigration laws			2
that is not just my opinion , but that of the @entity19 @entity118 , which ruled against @entity15 's @entity119 , and of many police officers and law enforcement officials around the country			1
when undocumented immigrants live in the shadows , they become wary of law enforcement , crimes go unreported , perpetrators remain on the loose , and the safety of our communities is affected			1
anti-immigrant forces have long scapegoated undocumented immigrants as the reason for higher crime rates and the need for greater border security			0
we in law enforcement must come together and inform our senators that immigrants are a valuable part of our communities			2
research shows that areas with a high immigrant population often have much lower rates of crime than similar areas without high immigrant representation			0
our borders are also more secure than they have ever been , with the @entity19 already spending more than $ 17 billion annually on immigration and border enforcement			1
while it is important to control access to our nation and keep track of those who visit or come to work , establishing complete border security should not hold hostage the rest of the needed changes : immigration reform means both border security and a sensible path to citizenship for aspiring @entity19 , instead of a narrow focus on just enforcement			1
as the immigration bill moves through @entity30 , the law enforcement community must lend its voice to demanding real comprehensive reform of our immigration system			1
we must rally around the most important aspect of the legislation -- an honest pathway to citizenship , not one filled with landmines , for the majority of aspiring @entity19 who already contribute to our economy and our communities			0
passing comprehensive immigration reform will make our communities safer and make our country stronger			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			0

@entity184 : law enforcement should lend support to immigration reform
he says immigrants less likely to report if they are victims of crimes if they fear police
when he was top *cop* in @entity14 , @entity15 , he built trust with immigrants ; crime rate fell
@entity184 : secure borders *key* , but at the same time @entity19 needs path to citizenship
