the @entity0 unanimously ruled on thursday that human genes can not be patented			1
but in something of a compromise , all nine justices said while the naturally occurring isolated biological material itself is not patentable , a synthetic version of the gene material may be patented			1
legal and medical experts believe the decision will have a lasting impact on genetic testing , likely making varieties more widely available and more affordable			1
the overriding legal question addressed was whether " products of nature " can be treated the same as " human - made " inventions , allowing them to be held as the exclusive intellectual property of individuals and companies			1
the broader issue involved 21st century conflicts over cutting - edge medical science , the power of business and individual legal rights , and how their convergence might influcence decisionmaking over how people and medicine manage the prospect and reality of certain diseases , like cancer			1
the issue has deeply divided the scientific and business communities			1
but it was a blockbuster celebrity , actress @entity40 who brought it to the public in announcing last month that she underwent a double mastectomy following a genetic test			1
the @entity0 case involves @entity45 , a @entity46 - based company that was sued over its claim of patents relating to two types of biological material that it identified -- @entity54 and @entity55 , whose mutations are linked to increased hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer			1
since @entity45 owns the patent on breast cancer genes , it was the only company that could perform tests for potential abnormalities			1
it says 1 million patients have benefited from its " @entity66 " technology , and that about 250,000 such tests are performed yearly			0
an initial test catches most problems , but the company also offers a second called @entity72 to detect the rest , a diagnostic that can cost several thousand dollars			1
@entity40 had @entity45 's breast cancer test			1
plaintiffs and testing among those challenging the @entity45 patents were sisters @entity80 and @entity82			0
@entity80 was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40			1
the initial brca test proved negative , meaning her family members were not likely at risk			0
but @entity82 later developed ovarian cancer			1
the second @entity72 testing proved positive , meaning the siblings carried the cancer - causing mutation all along			2
money was not an issue for them , but @entity80 and @entity82 , along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say @entity45 has not made the @entity72 tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers			2
breast cancer survivor @entity104 was another plaintiff			1
she faced having to pay thousands for @entity45 's test to see if she had a mutation for ovarian cancer			2
because of cost , she waited 18 months before she could afford it , learning she carried a mutation , according to the @entity111 , which represented plaintiffs			0
all sides agree the science of isolating the building blocks of life is no easy task			0
@entity45 has said it has spent several years and hundreds of millions of dollars in its research			0
but the issue of patenting has divided the scientific and business communities			2
a history of patent protection in the past 31 years , 20 percent of the human genome has been protected under @entity126 patents			2
on one side of the @entity45 case , scientists and companies argued patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives			2
on the other , patient rights groups and civil libertarians countered the patent holders were " holding hostage " the diagnostic care and access of information available to high - risk patients			0
outside the court during oral arguments in april , several protesters held signs , such as " your corporate greed is killing my friends " and " my genes are not property			2
" the patent system was created more than two centuries ago with a dual purpose			0
one is to offer temporary financial incentives for those at the ground floor of innovative products like the combustible engine and the x-ray machine			2
the second is to ensure one company does not hold a lifetime monopoly that might discourage competition and consumer affordability			2
all patent submissions rely on a complex reading of applicable laws , distinguishing between abstract ideas and principles , and more tangible scientific discoveries and principles			0
the @entity0 ruling the @entity0 has long allowed patent protection for the creation of a new process or use for natural products			1
whether " isolating " or " extracting " genes themselves qualifies for such protection became the central argument			0
the justices took the position offered by the @entity186 administration -- @entity187 itself is not patentable but so - called " cdna " can be			0
complementary dna is artificially synthesized from the genetic template , and engineered to produce gene clones			2
use of this protein - isolating procedure , known as " tagging , " is especially important in mapping and cataloguing the vast human genome			0
" genes and the information they encode are not patent - eligible under [ federal law ] simply because they have been isolated from the surrounding genetic material , " said justice @entity197 , who wrote the 9 - 0 court opinion			1
" @entity45 did not create anything , " said @entity197			0
" to be sure , it found an important and useful gene , but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention			0
" but @entity197 said , " cdna does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring , isolated dna segments			0
" see also : @entity0 backs dna swab after arrest reaction to the decision the @entity111 said the decision represents a major shift in patent law and overturns established policy			1
" today , the court struck down a major barrier to patient care and medical innovation , " said @entity222 , senior staff attorney with the @entity223			0
" @entity45 did not invent the @entity55 genes and should not control them			0
because of this ruling , patients will have greater access to genetic testing and scientists can engage in research on these genes without fear of being sued			0
" dr. @entity237 , a professor at @entity238 and director of genetic and genomic testing at @entity241 in @entity242 , said the decision will not undermine the genetically engineered drug industry and expects the costs of tests to fall			0
we can offer @entity55 1 and 2 testing to low - income women without concerns about how it will be paid for , " he said			0
@entity40 also hoped for a meaningful impact			1
" i hope that this ruling will lead to more women at risk of breast cancer being able to get access to gene testing and to take control of their lives , not just in the @entity126 but around the world -- whatever their means and whatever their background , " she said			1
@entity265 , president and chief executive officer of @entity45 , said in a statement the company believed the court " appropriately upheld our claims on @entity270 " the ruling , he added " underscored the patent eligibility of our method claims , ensuring strong intellectual property protection for our @entity276 test moving forward			1
" investors in @entity45 were pleased with the ruling with the stock soaring as much as 9 % before settling back but still higher			0
the case is @entity282 ( 12 - 398 )			0

unanimous ruling a compromise ; court says synthetic material , @entity270 , can be patented
actress @entity40 drove attention to the issue involving breast cancer
issue was whether " products of nature " could be treated *similarly* to human inventions
company at center of case says decision upheld a key claim on synthetic dna
