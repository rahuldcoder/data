-- two therapists who try to turn gay people straight , along with a student who says he was successfully converted to heterosexuality , are suing nearly two dozen @entity6 state officials , including gov. @entity7 , saying a new state law infringes on their civil rights			1
the plaintiffs ' legal team will file a motion sometime this month seeking an injunction before the law goes into effect , attorney @entity10 told @entity0 on thursday			1
the legislation known as @entity18 -- which the state @entity19 passed in may , @entity7 signed into law this weekend , and will take effect january 1 -- prohibits attempts to change the sexual orientation of patients under age 18			1
" we have not seen the state of @entity6 go this far before in trying to restrict speech , " @entity10 said			2
the non-profit @entity31 , whom @entity10 works for , filed the lawsuit monday in @entity34 on behalf of family therapist @entity35 , psychiatrist dr. @entity36 , and @entity37 , who is studying to become a therapist , and who court papers say " seeks to share his personal experiences with future patients as a mental health professional			2
" @entity6 governor @entity45 ban on gay conversion therapy the institute describes itself as a " legal defense organization specializing in the defense of religious freedom , parental rights , and other civil liberties			1
" the plaintiffs say they 're seeking a judgment finding the new law unconstitutional , injunctions against the law 's enforcement , and attorney 's fees , according to the legal complaint			1
among other concerns , the complaint details arguments that @entity66 violates @entity6 ' rights to privacy , freedom of religion , and due process			2
" certainly , the religious freedom aspect is very strong in this case , " @entity10 said			2
the @entity73 -- which is the world 's largest of its kind , with more than 36,000 members -- has determined that sexual orientation change efforts , as the complaint calls the controversial therapy , pose a great risk , including increasing the likelihood or severity of depression , anxiety and self - destructive behavior for those undergoing therapy			1
therapists ' alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self - hatred already felt by patients , the association says			2
" this bill bans non-scientific ' therapies ' that have driven young people to depression and suicide , " @entity7 recently tweeted			1
" these practices have no basis in science or medicine			0
" earlier this year , psychiatrist @entity105 apologized for his 2003 study of reparative therapy in which he suggested that the practice could help gays and lesbians become straight			0
he said the study was deeply flawed			0
" i believe i owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy , " @entity105 said in a letter to the editor of the @entity114			0
" i also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that i had proven that reparative therapy works with some ' highly motivated ' individuals			0
" but according to the complaint , when @entity37 underwent " therapy described in the statute as " sexual orientation change efforts and reparative therapy , he " found it quite helpful in achieving his goals			1
" @entity37 had " experienced same - sex attractions			0
... however , he never believed the simplistic message of the @entity141 , which states that ' we are born this way and should just live accordingly , ' " the complaint says			0
the case revolves around a legal issue , not a moral one , according to @entity10			0
" it 's not a debate in court about whether reparative therapy is a good thing , or how well it works , so much as it is a debate of the role of the government dictating to professionals , patients , and religious institutions what their options are going to be in that area , " he said			0
@entity160 , a spokesman for the @entity161 , told @entity0 on monday his group would file its own lawsuit against the new statute			0
" we do competent therapy , therapy that truly works , " said @entity160 , who said he underwent such therapy and now administers it to others			0
a summons filed on wednesday requires that each of the defendants respond to the @entity31 with an answer to the complaint within 21 days after receiving the paperwork			0
beyond @entity7 , the defendants include state officials @entity176 and @entity178 , as well as the members of the @entity180 and the @entity181			1
the first scheduled court hearing in the case is a pretrial scheduling conference on january 22 , according to court papers			2
however , @entity10 said he expects the court will respond to a motion for a preliminary injunction by setting a hearing date later this year , prior to the january 1 implementation of the new law			1
opinion : oops , i left my sexual orientation at home @entity0 's @entity196 contributed to this story			1

new : @entity200 ' attorney says he hopes for a preliminary injunction before the law takes effect
gov. @entity7 signed the bill into law this week
the plaintiffs say the law infringes on their constitutional rights
the law bans trying to change minors ' sexual orientation ; it will take effect january 1
