while the nation waits to see whether the @entity2 will be dismantled by the @entity4 @entity3 , it is worth reviewing how the act affected one group that had long opposed black suffrage : southern white politicians before 1965 , many white officeholders helped build their career by preventing blacks from voting			1
they could easily ignore black citizens			0
in the very first primary election after passage of the @entity2 , that began to change			2
in @entity17 in 1966 , @entity16 was standing in for her husband , @entity18 , who was unable to run again because of term limits			1
she faced a challenge from attorney general @entity21 , the first @entity22 to seek black votes			1
if elected , he promised to remove the @entity25 flag that flew atop the @entity26 and delete the words " @entity28 " from the party emblem			0
flowers campaigned mostly in black communities and joined in singing " @entity33			0
" in return , he received the support of the rev. @entity36 and @entity17 's two largest black political groups , the @entity37 and the @entity38 , groups shunned by white candidates			1
other candidates , once intensely racist , surprisingly followed @entity31 ' lead			2
@entity45 -- head of @entity17 's @entity46 and one of the architects of @entity49 , the assault on @entity52 - to - @entity53 marchers on march 7 , 1965 , by state troopers and deputies -- sought black votes in his race for @entity57 sheriff			1
" i want the support of everybody , white or colored , " he said			0
as for @entity49 , he claimed that he had wanted to let the marchers proceed , but the governor overruled him , making him the " scapegoat " for what occurred			0
if elected , he promised that the sheriff 's office would include black deputies			2
even more startling was the behavior of @entity66 , sheriff of @entity67 , who was seeking re-election			0
just the year before , @entity66 had treated african - americans seeking the right to vote in @entity52 with unparalleled savagery and led the @entity49 assault			2
now he attempted to woo black voters			0
on april 24 , he invited them to join him at a picnic where beer and barbecue were served			0
" a man ca n't beat us in 1964 and 1965 and expect us to vote for him in 1966 , " noted one black leader			1
because black votes now counted , reporters covering the campaign noted that the n - word , once a political staple , had disappeared			0
@entity18 , accustomed to saying " @entity87 , " now struggled to remember that it should be pronounced " @entity89			0
" while @entity16 won an overwhelming victory on @entity91 , @entity45 received less than one - tenth of the number of votes cast for his opponent			0
@entity66 , facing defeat , attempted to steal his election , but he was blocked by assistant attorney general @entity97 , who took him to court in the first lawsuit brought under the @entity2			1
@entity66 lost in court , ending his long reign of terror in @entity17			1
the 1966 @entity17 primary was a preview of what was to come			1
in the years that followed , @entity18 apologized for his earlier racist views and sought the support of black voters			2
but perhaps more important -- and more striking -- was the evolution of @entity110 's @entity109 , who had opposed the @entity2 in 1965 and its renewal in 1970 and 1975			1
in 1982 , civil rights activists worried that @entity109 would use his power as chairman of the @entity115 to kill the act 's reauthorization			1
@entity109 's opposition to integration went back decades			1
in 1948 , @entity122 's civil rights programs had led @entity109 to bolt the @entity123 and run for president as a " @entity125			1
" as a senator , @entity109 launched a historic filibuster against the 1957 @entity128 and denounced the 1964 @entity128 as " vicious			2
" that same year @entity109 became a @entity129 and supported @entity130 for president , beginning the political transformation of the @entity110 from staunchly @entity123 to reliably @entity129			0
by 1982 , 30 % of the voters in @entity109 's state were black , leaving the senator little choice but to vote for the act			1
in doing so , he said that he did not want to fall victim to " the common perception that a vote against the bill indicates opposition to the right to vote and , indeed , opposition to the group of citizens who are protected under the @entity2			2
" or , as he earlier told a racist colleague who lost a campaign for governor of @entity110 , " we ca n't win elections any more by cussin ' @entity87			0
" the @entity2 had succeeded in doing what it was created to do : create millions of new black voters , and -- less understood -- free white @entity154 politicians from always opposing black gains			1
there is no better example of democracy in action			0
in 2006 , not a single senator from a state covered by the @entity2 voted against its renewal			0
should the @entity3 now significantly weaken the protection of minority voting that the act provides , we may well return to a time when " cussin ' @entity87 " is again a politically acceptable strategy .			0

@entity171 : court to consider 1965 's @entity2 provision
he says in 1966 , @entity17 's white attorney general broke ground seeking the black vote
he says racist candidates , even @entity109 , would end up courting the black vote
may : @entity2 *increased* the black vote and altered the *approach* of white @entity154 politicians
