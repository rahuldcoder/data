-- the next train arriving at platform three will be ... completely stuck			0
that was nearly the scenario in @entity7 where , it 's been revealed , the country 's main train company ordered a fleet of new trains that were too big to fit in hundreds of stations			1
@entity11 , whose swift and efficient services are normally a point of pride for the @entity7 , spent 15 billion euros ( $ 20.5 billion ) on the trains , only to belatedly realize they were n't quite slim enough			2
the revelation that the new @entity19 trains were too " paunchy " for the regional stations they will be serving was made by investigative newspaper @entity22 , and widely reported in the @entity7 media			0
the mixup is reported to have occurred when @entity25 , which operates @entity7 's rail network , gave station dimensions to @entity11 in advance of the train order			1
measurements were taken from more modern stations , but neglected to include older facilities where the gap between platforms is narrower			0
@entity25 and @entity11 both released statements saying the new trains were part of a network upgrade to cope with a 40 % increase in passengers over the next decade			0
they said 50 million euros were being spent on upgrading 1,300 platforms to accommodate the new trains .			1
