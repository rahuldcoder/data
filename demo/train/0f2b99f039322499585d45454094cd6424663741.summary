-- ten years ago , @entity1 and @entity2 entered the wine business with nothing more than a bare plot of land			1
@entity1 and @entity2 with their wine awards			1
both were approaching 60 and , while they were familiar with what made a good bottle of red , they had no idea how to make it			2
that did n't stop them			2
this year , industry experts judged their 2005 @entity19 pinot noir the best red wine in the world			1
it beat 4,760 other entries to take the @entity25 award in the @entity26 , the world 's biggest blind tasting			1
and , it was the first time a vineyard outside @entity31 took @entity33 's top prize for best pinot noir over Â£ 10			1
" we were amazed , " said @entity35			2
" it 's impeccable timing for a small vineyard in the face of such extensive competition			1
" success has come rather suddenly for @entity1 and @entity2			1
after 45 years of marriage , three children and varied careers in management , real estate and teaching , they had been looking to wind down			2
they sold their house in @entity51 and moved to rural @entity52 to search for something to keep them occupied in later life			1
" i 'm really wary about the word retirement , " @entity1 says			1
" i do n't quite understand it , although the reality is that it is our income so you could say it 's our retirement			2
" they had been considering entering the dairy industry , but as they criss - crossed the country searching for a place to settle down , the stunning landscape of @entity63 in @entity52 's @entity64 won them over			1
" just the sheer beauty of the place led us to say right let 's give it a go , " says @entity35			2
as it turns out , @entity74 , one hour outside @entity73 , was an ideal place to grow grapes			2
" we knew that from research on record we had good soil types and in relative proximity we could see grapes growing			2
the plot was just a bare 11 hectares , or 27 acres			2
it had a nice slope to the north , north - west , so you 've got that sun bearing down on it all of the day			2
everything seemed to be lined up and , as it turns out , it has been			0
" they planted their first vines in 1997			0
back then it was a part - time job			0
every weekend they 'd drive up into the hills from their home in @entity95 , @entity96 to tend their vines			0
they built a house on the site and moved there in 2001			0
even then it did n't demand their full attention			0
until june , @entity35 was working full - time as the chief executive of the local hospital			0
" not bad for an old fella , " he laughs			0
@entity2 , 68 , shares his passion for a day 's hard work washed down with a glass of fine wine each night			1
" some people just are energetic and love what they 're doing			0
that 's a huge help , " she says			0
" we 're avid learners really			0
we used to spend a lot more time in the vineyard but as time went by we discovered that there was more and more paperwork to be done			1
" " @entity1 still loves to get out and do the mowing up and down the rows and have a good look to see what 's actually going on out there			1
from time to time we 've both got out and done some picking			0
" @entity1 is quick to correct the suggestion that their success is anything other than the result of hard work by a dedicated viticulturalist and his team , as well as an expert winemaker			1
renowned @entity52 winemaker @entity137 started working with them before the first grapes were picked			1
he has his own label and is very selective about to whom he lends his expertise			0
" i have worked with many , many grape growers in 28 years of winemaking			0
i never try to push my thoughts on them because usually they will cost the grower money , but simply say what i think and let them make the decision , " he says			0
" @entity1 and @entity2 have listened , then acted			1
they have been fine tuning their viticulture , i have been fine tuning the winemaking , and the vines have been getting older and doing their job better			0
but underneath it all is a shared philosophy , which is to do everything in the vineyard and winemaking to make the best wine possible			1
there are no shortcuts aimed at saving money			0
" pinot noir grapes are notoriously difficult to nurture			1
they 're thin - skinned , susceptible to rot and are really only successfully grown in three locations : @entity167 in @entity31 , @entity168 in the @entity169 , and @entity52 's @entity63 region			1
there , growers go to great lengths to ward off winter frosts in the cold mountain ranges			0
some fly helicopters low over the vines to stir up the icy air			0
at @entity19 , there are two wind - machines on standby if the temperature starts to plummet			0
the rest of the season , the vines are pruned and tended by hand , the grapes individually picked			0
strangely , the vineyard 's " spare no expense " philosophy has n't produced a hideously expensive wine			1
visitors to the cellar door can buy a bottle for 38 @entity52 dollars , or less than u.s. $ 30			1
and , despite the scarcity of the product -- there are only 100 " uncommitted " cases left -- the @entity199 have not put up the price -- yet			0
" we 're contemplating that , and the consequences of doing that in the longer term			0
at the end of the day you 're talking about long term viability and sustainability rather than short - term gains , " @entity1 says			1
this couple , although approaching 70 , is in it for the long haul			2
the judges called their 2005 pinot noir well integrated , harmonious and impeccably balanced			1
the same might be said about them			0

@entity1 and @entity2 own the @entity220 vineyard in @entity52
the couple started making wine without any previous experience
their 2005 pinot noir has been judged the best wine in the world this year
