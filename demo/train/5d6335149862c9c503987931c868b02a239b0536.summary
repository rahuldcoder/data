-- when @entity3 co-founder @entity2 succumbed to cancer in his @entity6 home a year ago today , the world rushed to eulogize him in glowing terms : genius			1
a modern - day @entity9			0
obituaries and video clips focused on how he led a mobile - computing revolution , upended the music industry with @entity15 and , at @entity16 , changed the way movies are made			0
pundits marveled at his brilliance in creating a mystique about @entity3 products and knowing which unborn electronic gadgets consumers would most desire			1
fans lit candles outside @entity3 stores around the world , and more than a million people left thanks or tributes to @entity2 on @entity3 's website			1
10 things @entity2 taught us but in the 12 months since , as high - profile books have probed @entity2 ' life and career , that reputation has evolved somewhat			1
nobody has questioned @entity2 ' seismic impact on computing and our communication culture			1
but as writers have documented @entity2 ' often callous , controlling personality , a fuller portrait of the mercurial @entity3 ceo has emerged			1
" everyone knows that @entity2 had his ' rough ' side			1
that 's partially because he really did have a rough side and partially because the rough @entity2 was a better news story than the human @entity2 , " said @entity52 , author of " @entity53 : the obsession that drives @entity58			1
" " since @entity3 is the most - watched company on @entity60 , there are a ton of writers always looking for the new angle , " @entity52 added			1
" after all the glowing tributes to @entity2 ran their course , it 's not surprising that the more negative articles would start to pop up			1
" 10 great quotes from @entity2 the book nineteen days after @entity2 ' death , @entity71 's much - awaited biography of the @entity3 leader hit stores and immediately became the top - selling book in the country			1
in " @entity2 , " @entity71 crafted a compelling narrative of how @entity2 ' co-founded @entity3 with @entity78 , got pushed out of the struggling company a decade later and then returned in the late 1990s to begin one of the most triumphant second acts in the annals of @entity84 business			1
but he also spent many pages chronicling the arrogant , cruel behavior of a complicated figure who could inspire people one minute and demean them the next			0
according to the book , @entity2 would often berate employees whose work he did n't like			1
he was notoriously difficult to please and viewed people and products in black and white terms			0
they were either brilliant or " sh - t. " as a young man @entity2 abandoned his pregnant girlfriend and was later a cold , distant father to his daughter , @entity103			1
and in one especially callous episode , @entity2 refused to give founding stock options to one of @entity3 's earliest employees , even after a fellow employee intervened and offered to match whatever @entity2 was willing to spare			1
" what @entity71 's book did was puncture a hole in the image the rest of the world had of @entity2 , " said @entity109 , a senior editor at @entity110 and author of " @entity112 : how @entity84 's @entity118 -- and secretive -- @entity119			2
" thanks to @entity71 , " the population at large has gotten a much fuller picture of who he really was , " @entity109 added			0
" i do n't think that really changes anyone 's opinion of his accomplishments			0
it just may change their opinion of him			0
" the @entity71 book , and other accounts of @entity2 ' life and work , have reinforced parallel images of the late executive as an ingenious innovator but a demanding , unpleasant person			2
" his stature is greater than ever			0
no one denies his brilliance and his legacy , " said @entity142 , editor and publisher of cult of @entity145 and author of " @entity147 , " a book about @entity2			2
" however , his personality , his methods , have been thrown into a harsh new light by @entity71 's biography , " @entity142 told @entity0			0
" everyone knew he was a taskmaster , but his cruelty -- his relentless , humorless pursuit of corporate perfection -- was n't so widely acknowledged			0
it 's certainly put some people off			0
some see his life as a warning			0
it 's a lesson in how not to devote your life to your work			0
" this dichotomy was reinforced in july when @entity171 published a cover story , " do you really want to be like @entity2 ? " and a cover image of @entity2 wearing both a halo and devil horns			2
the article argued that @entity2 ' example has created two camps of people : those who want to emulate his ruthless , idiosyncratic business style , and those who are turned off by his failings as a father and a human			2
" indeed , his life story has emerged as an odd sort of holy scripture for entrepreneurs , a gospel and an anti-gospel at the same time , " said the article , by @entity187			0
" to some , @entity2 ' life has revealed the importance of sticking firmly to one 's vision and goals , no matter the psychic toll on employees or business associates			2
to others , @entity2 serves as a cautionary tale , a man who changed the world but at the price of alienating almost everyone around him			2
" did @entity3 's fanboy fever peak with @entity2 ? @entity3 since @entity2 some observers say that @entity3 's mighty financial performance over the past year , its stock price is almost $ 300 higher now than it was when @entity2 died and @entity3 is now the world 's most valuable company , diminishes @entity2 ' legacy			1
if he was so crucial to the company , why are they doing better without him ? others say @entity3 's ongoing success cements @entity2 ' business reputation because the company is being run by a team that he handpicked and is still releasing products , most notably the third - generation @entity223 and the @entity224 , that he helped design			1
( and @entity3 's product launches are n't as interesting anymore			2
) " it 's hard to argue that @entity3 's great financial performance in the last year diminishes @entity2 's importance at all			1
it 's safe to say that everything we 've seen so far has had @entity2 's mark on it , " @entity52 said			2
" from this point forward , not as much			0
the next year or two should be interesting times for @entity3 watchers , as @entity2 's direct influence slips further into the past			1
" then there 's the issue of the much - maligned new @entity3 maps , which replaced @entity243 as the default mapping system on @entity245 , @entity3 's new mobile operating system			1
@entity3 ceo @entity247 issued a rare public apology last month for the maps , which have misplaced or mislabeled multiple streets and landmarks			2
who is the next @entity2 ? a few pundits grumbled that @entity2 the perfectionist , with his obsessive attention to detail , never would have allowed @entity3 to release such a flawed product			1
others pointed out that @entity2 presided over such @entity3 flops as @entity259 , a subscription service for owners of @entity3 products , and @entity263 , a social network centered around music			1
@entity52 does n't think the maps fiasco will have much impact on @entity2 ' legacy either way			2
" i do n't think anyone can conclude that @entity2 would have made a different decision about releasing @entity273 , " he said in an e-mail to @entity0			2
" but i also do n't think @entity2 would have been as apologetic as @entity247 was in his open letter			0
i imagine he would have done something similar to what he did when dealing with the backlash against @entity3 's ban on @entity280			0
of course there is a big difference here , in that @entity280 had a lot of enemies and @entity243 has a lot of fans			0
" your thoughts on the next @entity2 in the long term , however , @entity3 's fluctuating stock price and flaps over maps probably wo n't do much to change consumers ' opinions of the man who birthed their beloved phones and tablets			1
and if @entity2 is remembered decades from now , it 'll likely be as the man who invented the @entity299 , @entity224 and @entity223 , not as the executive who was sometimes a tyrant			0
does anybody really care whether @entity302 was cranky ? " among @entity3 employees , i 'd say his reputation has n't changed one bit			0
if anything , it 's probably grown because they 've realized how central his contributions were , " @entity109 said			0
" history tends to forgive people 's foibles and recognize their accomplishments			0
when @entity2 died , he was compared to @entity9 and @entity315 and to @entity316			1
i do n't know what his place will be in history 30 , 40 , 50 years from now			0
and one year is certainly not enough time ( to judge )			0
" how @entity3 has changed under @entity247			0

the *initial* rush to *declare* him a brilliant visionary have evolved
