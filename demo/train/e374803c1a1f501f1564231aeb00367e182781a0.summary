-- @entity2 airstrikes earlier this month during a western @entity5 battle with @entity7 militants may have killed up to 30 civilians , an interim @entity2 military report said on wednesday			1
villagers sit near the graves of victims of airstrikes in @entity13 , in western @entity14			2
the report is part of an ongoing investigation into a fight in @entity14 , where villagers reported civilian casualties as a result of @entity2 bombing runs on may 4			1
" a review of the physical evidence is inconclusive in determining the exact number of civilian and insurgent casualties , " the military said in a statement detailing the report			1
" in all , the investigation team estimates that 60 - 65 @entity7 extremists were killed in these engagements , while at least 20 - 30 civilians may have been killed during the fighting			1
the investigators continue to attempt to better confirm casualty numbers			2
" the report was released amid widespread dismay and anger in @entity5 over several incidents of civilians caught in the crossfire of the war between international and @entity5 forces , and @entity7 militants			1
as the report was released , @entity46 's command reported that a tuesday airstrike caused casualties among civilians it says were held as human shields by insurgents in the southern @entity5 province of @entity55			1
complicating the @entity2 military effort to determine an accurate death toll for insurgents and civilians in the @entity61 incident is the fact that @entity63 quickly bury their dead and the @entity7 do n't wear traditional uniforms			1
the military statement said that incident began when " a large number of @entity7 fighters " came to the villages of @entity68 and @entity69 on may 3 and demanded payments from village officials			2
the military said there were reports that militants executed three former officials of the government of the @entity80 of @entity5			1
@entity82 and soldiers embarked on an operation to oust the @entity7 militants , the report said			0
when police approached @entity69 , they were ambushed and five police died			0
that prompted the local governor to call in coalition troops			0
as coalition and @entity5 troops worked to help the police , @entity7 militants fired on those forces			1
during this fight , the coalition called in @entity97 air support to counter enemy fire and rescue a wounded @entity5 soldier trapped by @entity7 fire			1
that soldier , a first sergeant , was hustled to safety by coalition and @entity5 troops			2
" following this , one @entity106 provided fires in coordination with the ground commander on buildings and a tree grove insurgents were firing from or massing in , " the military said			0
@entity5 and @entity2 forces remained in the area until morning and saw the return of villagers who fled the area before fighting			1
a @entity2 military source , who requested anonymity because the full investigation has not been made public , said a review of combat camera footage and cockpit audio recordings indicates three @entity125 and a single b - 1 bomber took sequential turns over @entity14 during the fighting			2
the @entity106 dropped three bombs and the @entity125 dropped five , the official said			0
the military statement said video " clearly depicts insurgents entering the buildings , which were then targeted in the final strikes of the fight			0
" " combined with audio recordings of the ground commander and air crew conversations , the investigators were able to confirm that the insurgents fleeing from the firefight were regrouping in several small rural buildings , which were then subsequently destroyed			0
" the source said civilian deaths were " most likely " accidental			1
military investigators who went to the region found one grave site with 22 fresh mounds and another site with four			0
they also went to a mass grave , but could not determine how many people were buried there			0
military investigators thought it was an insurgent grave site , because the mass grave was not pointed toward @entity158 -- usual for @entity160 burials -- and did not have the markings of a traditional grave of the region , the official said			0
insurgents usually are buried in that untraditional manner , the @entity2 military source said			2
in the past , the @entity2 military has paid compensation to victims ' families and intensely criticized the @entity7 for holding civilians in conflict zone -- and did so again on wednesday			1
" we regret the loss of any civilian life and express our condolences to the families who lost loved ones in this fighting with insurgents firing from and regrouping in villagers ' homes , " said col. @entity172 , a @entity2 military spokesman			1
" we continue to work closely with the @entity183 to bring security and progress to @entity5 , and to do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties			1
we strongly condemn the @entity7 for their brutality in deliberately targeting and using civilians as human shields			2
" @entity46 's @entity191 said on wednesday that an airstrike targeting militants in @entity55 caused civilian casualties and said possibly eight civilians died			1
the incident occurred in @entity196 -- south of @entity197 in @entity55 on tuesday , and it began when about 25 insurgents attacked an @entity191 patrol			0
troops called in air support during what @entity191 called a " dangerous situation , " and an aircraft dropped " one piece of ordnance , which ended the engagement			0
" " the @entity191 troops , however , were not aware that the insurgents were once again using civilians as human shields			2
if this information had been known by @entity191 troops , no ordnance would have been used , " @entity191 said			0
" this terrible incident again shows the insurgents ' blatant disregard for the lives of @entity5 people			2
" the bombing happened about 8 a.m. wednesday ( 0430 gmt ) on the road between @entity222 and @entity223			0
the attack was under investigation , a military statement said			0
further information was withheld , pending notification of next of kin			0
@entity0 @entity231 correspondent @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
