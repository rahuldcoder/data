@entity0 -- @entity2 made a practice run in @entity4 the day before he allegedly tried to blow up a car bomb in @entity6 , according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of his questioning			1
last friday , @entity2 drove his white @entity11 from @entity12 through @entity6 , where he staked out potential locations for the following night 's planned attack , the source said			1
he then parked the @entity11 several blocks away from @entity6 , though the precise location was unclear , and took a train back to @entity12 , the source said			1
on saturday night , with his recently acquired @entity20 loaded with his makeshift explosives , @entity2 drove southbound along @entity4 's @entity22 on @entity23 to the 49th street exit , the source said			1
@entity2 then pulled over and reached into the @entity20 's rear compartment where he attempted to set into motion the process needed to set off the homemade bomb , the source said			1
the source , who did not explain how @entity2 had attempted to set off the bomb , said he then took a number of turns and wound up entering @entity6 by driving south down @entity34			1
the source said @entity2 told investigators he turned right onto 45th street toward @entity37 because he saw a place to pull over			1
it 's unclear why @entity2 left the @entity20 's engine running and hazard lights blinking			1
but because of an incredible goof , @entity2 could n't use his escape car			2
he had accidentally left the keys to that vehicle in the @entity20 that he thought was about to blow up , the source said			1
he apparently went to a train station , where he boarded a @entity49 train back to @entity12			2
another law enforcement source said investigators found a train receipt used by @entity2 that is stamped about 7 p.m. , a half hour after a witness notified authorities that the car in @entity6 was filing with smoke			1
sources say investigators believe he ran to catch the train that pulled out around 7 or 7:15 saturday night			0
the source added that police investigators have discovered a surveillance video of @entity2 walking in @entity62 -- which runs between 44th and 45th streets just west of @entity64 -- moments after witnesses saw the smoky suv			1
in the video he is wearing a white baseball cap			0
efforts also continued wednesday to determine what may have motivated @entity2			2
an official familiar with the investigation said wednesday that @entity2 felt @entity74 was under attack			1
any grudge @entity2 may have held against the @entity77 appears to have developed recently , according to a senior @entity77 official who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly			1
the investigation has found nothing to indicate that @entity2 had any long - standing grudge or anger toward the @entity77 , the official said			1
" what we know is , the dynamic appeared to have changed in the last year , " the official said			1
investigators have not determined whether @entity2 had any training from @entity91 groups in anything , the source said			1
additionally , the official suggested , detentions in @entity91 have been carried out to collect information and not because officials had reached any conclusions about their guilt or ties to any groups			0
" they are reaching out to people , bringing them in and doing their due diligence , but ' arrest ' suggests a strong connection to the guy			0
while anything is possible , they have n't arrived at any conclusion , " the source said			0
authorities in @entity91 have rounded up a number of people for questioning , as @entity77 law enforcement sought wednesday to piece together the actions and motivations of @entity2			2

they said others were taken into custody for questioning on wednesday , but could not say how many , who they were or where they were seized			0
a senior @entity77 official said investigators were looking into possible links between @entity2 and @entity91 groups and had found none , " but that does n't say there is no connection			1
" the official added that there was nothing to indicate @entity2 is from an extremist family			1
asked whether @entity2 was a " wannabe " who may be inflating his contacts , the source said , " it is going to take a little more time for the investigation to gel			1
" investigators have uncovered no evidence that @entity2 had @entity77 - based associates related to the plot , a federal law enforcement official said wednesday			1
investigators believe he handled the logistics himself , from purchasing the car to buying the materials for the bomb , the official said			2
investigators are looking for any associates who may be overseas , the official said			0
the federal law enforcement official said wednesday that @entity2 was still cooperating with the @entity183 and had waived his right to a lawyer			1

a @entity217 agent exposed his badge and said , " @entity217 , " an administration official said			0
in @entity221 , @entity220 spokesman @entity219 told reporters that " the @entity91 are fully cooperating in the investigation			0
they recognize , as we do , that this is a shared responsibility and a shared threat			0
" the charges paint him as a terrorist who received explosives training in @entity91 's volatile @entity134 region , where government forces have been working to root out @entity126 militants			0
the @entity91 @entity126 , a major militant group in the region , praised @entity2 but denied any link to him			2

last weekend , as they investigated the failed bombing attempt , @entity183 agents turned up a telephone number but no name in connection with @entity2 's purchase of a @entity20			1
when agents searched databases containing the numbers called by or to that phone , they found the number on the @entity217 report , the official said			0
that is how they came up with @entity2 's name			2
