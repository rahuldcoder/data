-- the number of unexplained dolphin deaths on @entity3 , @entity4 , rose friday , with rescuers tallying the toll at 103			1
about 160 common dolphins have been found since the animals began stranding themselves in early january , said @entity10 , a spokesman for the @entity11 , the organization leading the rescue the effort			1
the beachings have puzzled investigators , as rescue team members struggle to treat , tag and transport the living dolphins to the outer @entity3 coast to be released			1
while dolphin strandings are not uncommon on the cape , @entity21 , a marine manager for the group , said earlier this week the event is extraordinary in its " protracted " nature as well as the number of dolphins involved			1
" there is a large variability year to year , " she said , but this event represents " more than half my annual average in a month , " said @entity21			0
once beached , a dolphin is vulnerable to predators and susceptible to organ damage and sunburn			0
if a dolphin is still alive , the responders get it onto its stomach , if it is not already , for easier breathing			0
they keep away seagulls that would otherwise peck at it and warm it with blankets or cool it with water as necessary , @entity21 said			0
necropsies had been performed on at least nine of the dolphins , and blood and microbial swab samples have been taken from some that were found alive , @entity21 said			1
so far , no pattern of disease or trauma has been found that would point to a cause			0
although the winter and early spring are the normal time of year for dolphin strandings to occur , the weather this season has been unusually warm , leading to speculation about climate change and subsequently low " distribution of prey " as possible causes			2
@entity70 harbormaster @entity68 had earlier explained that usually , in the winter , " the harbor ices over and inhibits the animals from coming close to the shore			2
but now that the water is warmer , we 're seeing lots more dolphins washing up than ever before			2
" @entity21 cautioned that , while climate or other external factors such as acoustic disorientation ca n't be ruled out , " we do n't have a single answer			0
