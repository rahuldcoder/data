mass shootings have been occurring more frequently in recent years , an @entity2 study shows , with nearly one incident a month from 2000 to 2013			1
the study , which was released wednesday , reported 160 incidents during that time , with 486 people killed and 557 wounded			1
those figures do n't include the deaths or injuries of the shooters			0
the bureau called such shootings " active shooter incidents " -- which the report described as " individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in populated areas ( excluding shootings related to gang or drug violence )			1
" underscoring the difficulty authorities have to prevent such incidents or reduce their lethality , the study found that 60 % of the shootings ended before law enforcement officials arrived			1
in cases where investigators could determine the length of time of the incident , most of the shootings lasted under five minutes and many under two minutes			2
in 40 % of the cases studied , the shooters killed themselves			2
most of the shootings were carried out by males			1
only six of the " active shooters " in incidents during that time period were female			1
seventy percent of the incidents " occurred in either a commerce / business or educational environment , " the @entity2 said			2
@entity46 , the @entity2 's assistant director overseeing the @entity47 , said at a briefing that the study is part of a @entity52 - directed response to some of the recent mass shooting incidents and the need to understand what 's behind them and how to prevent them			1
because police and other first - responders often also are shot or wounded , the @entity2 hopes to implement better practices for local agencies usually first on the scene			2
" in essence , we 're trying to improve our readiness , " @entity46 said			0
frequency increasing and if you think such shootings seem to be happening more frequently in the past few years , you 're right			2
" in the first half of the years studied , the average annual number of incidents was 6.4 , but that average rose in the second half of the study to 16.4 , an average of more than one incident per month , " the study said			2
" recognizing the increased active shooter threat and the swiftness with which active shooter incidents unfold , these study results support the importance of training and exercises -- not only for law enforcement but also for citizens			1
" the @entity2 said the goal of the study is to " provide federal , state , and local law enforcement with accurate data so they can better understand how to prevent , prepare for , respond to , and recover from these incidents			1
" active shooter incidents differ from " a defined crime , such as a murder or mass killing , " the study says , because " the active aspect inherently implies that both law enforcement personnel and citizens have the potential to affect the outcome of the event based upon their responses			1
" 25 deadliest mass shootings in @entity106 history @entity107 leads the @entity2 's @entity108 2 in @entity109 , @entity110 , which is helping to study the motives for shootings and assists local police in detecting early signs that may indicate a suspect is planning one			1
@entity107 said at wednesday 's briefing that while the motives vary widely , more shooters appear to be inspired by past mass shootings			0
" the copycat phenomenon is real , " @entity107 said			0
anecdotal evidence shows that " many active shooters have a real or perceived deeply held personal grievance and the only remedy that they can perceive for that grievance is an act of catastrophic violence against a person or an institution , " @entity107 said			2
many shooters research major shooting events and find inspiration from the notoriety that killers receive			0
" as more and more notable and tragic events occur , we think we 're seeing more compromised and marginal individuals who are seeking inspiration from these past attacks , " @entity107 said			0
case studies among the incidents studied by the @entity2 for the report was the @entity141 shooting in @entity142 , @entity143 , on december 14 , 2012			1
gunman @entity144 , 20 , killed 20 children , ages 6 and 7 , and six adults at the school before killing himself			0
@entity149 later found the body of @entity144 's mother at her home			0
" in at least nine incidents , the shooter first shot and killed a family member ( s ) in a residence before moving to a more public location to continue shooting , " the @entity2 report said			1
another case studied for the report was the mass shooting at an @entity163 , @entity164 , movie theater in 2012			0
twelve people were killed and 58 wounded			0
accused gunman @entity166 pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the killings ; his trial begins next month			0
in 2007 , @entity172 student @entity171 shot and killed 32 people and wounded dozens more in a classroom building and a dorm on campus before killing himself			0
maj. @entity178 killed 13 people and wounded 32 at @entity180 , @entity181 , during a shooting rampage november 5 , 2009			0
he was convicted and sentenced to death .			0
