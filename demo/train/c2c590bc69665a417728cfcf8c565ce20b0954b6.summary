" @entity16 told @entity0 's " @entity36 " on monday the incident has provoked mixed reactions in the community , but " has really raised the fear factor for everyone			1
... we see the different type of fear with our children			2
it is very hard to explain to children what is going on			0
it is hard to explain to the little kids when they ask you , ' @entity46 , are these people for us or against us ? ' " a candlelight vigil , organized by @entity49 in response to the alleged arson , was held monday night in front of the @entity53			1
@entity54 , spokesman for @entity55 , said about 100 people attended the vigil			1
he said a truck with three or four men drove up bearing a sign that said " no mosque			1
" joined by three or four other mosque opponents , the men debated with some of those at the vigil for about an hour , @entity54 said			1
although voices were raised and there was some shouting , police did not interfere			0
" we did not step in , " said @entity54			0
" he added officers would have intervened if there were threats or physical altercations			0
the blaze is being investigated by the @entity19 , the @entity75 , and the @entity76			1
@entity75 spokesman @entity78 told @entity0 on monday night the investigation is continuing			1

the @entity15 has existed in the @entity5 area for more than a decade , according to its website , and currently meets about a mile from the site of the future mosque			2

" the congregation purchased a 15 - acre plot in 2009 and announced plans for a center that will include a mosque , educational facilities , a gym , cemetery and various recreational areas , including tracks , pavilions and a playground			2
the project has provoked controversy in @entity5 , about 35 miles southeast of @entity24 , and statewide			1
in july , several hundred opponents of the mosque staged a march against the project			1
some objected to @entity153 itself , carrying signs like " @entity156 , " while others opposed the project for environmental reasons			2
last month , @entity6 lt. gov. @entity160 publicly criticized the project			1
" you could even argue whether being a muslim is actually a religion , or is it a nationality , way of life , a cult , whatever you want to call it , " @entity160 , then a candidate for @entity6 governor , said at a rally			1
@entity160 placed third in @entity6 's @entity171 primaries earlier this month			1
" i think a lot of this has to do with timing , " said @entity16 , who said her husband is a @entity7 and she converted about 10 years ago			0
" this was an election year			0
you had a lot of candidates running their campaign off of terrorism or things like that , so i think it had to do with timing and misinformation			0
" the community has an open - door policy , she said , and welcomes the opportunity to answer questions posed by members of the public about @entity153 .			0
