@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity3 , @entity5 's postal service , has unveiled a range of stamps commemorating some of @entity5 's most notable @entity9 drivers , ranging from @entity10 in the 1950s to @entity11 in the 1980s			1
@entity12 is @entity5 's most successful formula 1 driver , having won world championships in 1969 , 1971 and 1973 the six stamps , in varying denominations , depict @entity10 in his 1957 @entity16 , @entity17 in his 1962 @entity18 , @entity19 in his 1963 @entity20 , @entity12 in his 1973 @entity21 , @entity22 in his 1976 @entity23 and @entity11 in his 1986 @entity24			2
the stamps were timed to capitalize on @entity28 's home grand prix at @entity29 , such is the fervor for the young @entity32 driver in @entity5			0
but industrial action -- a dispute about modernization plans and pay -- throughout the @entity3 has overshadowed their release			0
as a matter of protocol no @entity5 stamp can depict the face a living person other than the monarch , her majesty @entity45 , which explains why the cars are pictured from above , revealing only the tops of the drivers ' helmets			0
@entity3 has celebrated @entity9 1 before -- in 2004 it released a set of " smilers " stamps interspersed with non-postal stamps depicting the @entity55 formula 1 team -- but it is the first time it has created a set of postage stamps with a @entity9 theme			1
the stamps have caused some controversy as they celebrate one driver -- @entity10 -- who never won a world championship , while omitting @entity64 , the first @entity5 driver to win the title , and @entity67 , the last @entity5 driver to win the title			0
however @entity5 dependency , @entity69 , one of the @entity71 between @entity5 and @entity72 , has redressed the balance by releasing its own set of @entity9 postage stamps			1
the eight stamps -- released to coincide with the centenary of the @entity80 motor racing track , home to the very first @entity5 @entity82 -- depict all the drivers to have won world championships : @entity64 ( 1958 ) , @entity17 ( 1962 , 1968 ) , @entity19 ( 1963 , 1965 ) , @entity12 ( 1969 , 1971 , 1973 ) , @entity22 ( 1976 ) , @entity11 ( 1992 ) and @entity67 ( 1996 )			1
@entity5 is not the only country to have celebrated its @entity9 heritage in postage stamp form			0
in 1999 @entity88 produced a stamp to commemorate 70 years of the @entity90 @entity82 , picturing a single - seat @entity92 racer and @entity93 in a 1998 @entity94			0
even countries without an obvious @entity9 heritage have celebrated the sport and the @entity94 team in particular			2
@entity99 , which has been home to many formula 1 grands prix has produced @entity103 - themed stamps but so too have @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 & @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 & @entity113 and @entity114			1

@entity3 releases set of stamps celebrating @entity5 @entity103 drivers
@entity5 dependency releases rival set that does *n't* omit *key* drivers
several countries around the world have produced @entity94 - themed stamps , *including* many with no known @entity9 *association*
