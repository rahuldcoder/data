-- the future in video games is usually depicted in one of two ways			2
there is the techno version of the future , filled with personal electronic implants , space travel and laser weapons			2
or there is the apocalyptic version , where a world has been bombed back into the @entity14 -- and somehow still has laser weapons			2
" @entity16 : @entity22 , " the first - person shooter game that hit stores tuesday , transports players into two separate time periods : the 1980s and the not - so - distant future of 2025			1
the relatively narrow time lapse was necessary to build a story around a new villain , @entity23 , a terrorist bent on revenge against a world he feels has wronged him			2
the battles in the 1980s will use traditional weaponry expected for the time			2
however , @entity34 said the bigger challenge for the game 's developers was creating futuristic tech for 2025 that would be both recognizable and unpredictable			1
" once you go beyond 10 years out , i think there is quite a bit of discussion about what does this mean , where do energy weapons come into play , where does ( artificial intelligence ) and advanced robotics go ? " @entity34 said			0
the game is a sequel to 2010 's " @entity16 : @entity51 , " which sold more than 13.7 million units in the @entity53 alone to become one of the best - selling console games of all time			1
for the new game , creators tapped author @entity58 to help them imagine and design a world not too unlike the present day , but with a feel of advancement			1
@entity58 is a senior fellow in foreign policy at the @entity63 whose book , " @entity65 : the @entity70 and @entity71 in the @entity72 , " projected a vision of the future of war that developers were seeking			1
@entity58 told @entity0 he tried to identify key trends happening right now to help writers build a narrative for the new " @entity16 " game			1
" we focused on everything from technical trends , the emergence of robotics , some of the greater attention to warfare , and then also political trends , " @entity58 said			1
" the potential emergence of a proto - @entity87 between the [ @entity53 ] and @entity88			1
" the two superpowers are competing over a valuable new resource -- the rare earth elements used in the construction of nearly all smartphones , tablets and other electronic gadgets			0
@entity58 suggested this dwindling supply of rare earth elements could be a feasible backdrop for a new @entity87			1
" i was not aware of the significance of them and we all educated ourselves and became quasi-experts , " @entity34 said			0
" ( @entity58 ) was more than our military consultant			1
he became our political consultant for the future			2
" review : ' @entity106 ' is franchise 's best yet @entity58 said the world is no longer just driven by the motives of countries but the actions of non-state actors , such as terrorists or criminals			1
in creating a future for the new game , developers chose not the most likely scenario but one that is more entertaining for gaming purposes			1
" you 're not just trying to identify what 's likely and important , but also frankly , what 's cool , " he said			2
" what gives you the most ground to cover ... ( is it ) going to be cool for the gamers to play with ? " as development was progressing , some of @entity58 's projections for the future began appearing in the news			1
the game 's creators were excited but a little unnerved to be building the future before it happened			1
referencing @entity138 's @entity137 -- " any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic " -- @entity58 said the 2025 setting allows a familiarity with future technology that makes it seem more real			1
he tried to put his ideas into three different categories for developers			0
" ( @entity146 , ) it 's here and it 's being deployed in small numbers but you may not have heard about it , " @entity58 said			1
" secondly , it 's here but it 's in prototype stage			2
it 's in the stage where it is working somewhere , a lab , and we should expect to see it on the battlefield in the next coming years			2
" @entity58 's third category includes tech that 's still at the research stage and has n't emerged into a viable , working form			1
this is where @entity34 and his team focused much of their effort			0
" we did n't want it to feel too sci - fi			0
that was a term we used a lot , " @entity34 said			0
" we wanted it to feel grounded			0
it was also important on how it fit into the game			0
" @entity34 expected and planned for future tech to be smaller and more powerful , but @entity58 pushed them into going farther with their thinking			1
@entity34 also told him the designs had to work within the game 's narrative			1
" it is n't that we did n't want to take a leap of faith in mankind			0
you look at military technology and some things advance , but you see things that hang around for a while , " he said			0
" for example , there are a fair bit of weapons ( in the game ) that exist right now and that 's because we actually think they 'll be around ( in 13 years )			2
" designers also came up with new some equipment that 's never been seen before			0
" you 'll know it when you see it , " @entity34 said about what felt futuristic enough without being too much like science fiction			0
" sometimes , it was just art direction			0
it 's just a gut call , but we have to create our universe			0
" @entity34 hopes gamers will be impressed with their vision of the future			0
" i think when people start to play with the drones , they feel pretty badass , " @entity34 said			0
" there 's a sequence where we have a jet wing ( jet pack ) insertion that people are going to crap themselves over			0
" today 's cutting - edge weaponry inspired what appears in the game 's futuristic battles			1
but the influences also went the other way , too			0
an early trailer for " @entity16 : @entity22 " showed a piece of future military hardware that is n't on the current battlefield			1
a military contractor asked why it was n't being built and is now showing a prototype at trade shows , @entity58 said			2
" i say it half in jest , but this is one of the ways i will have a great deal of influence in shaping that future , " he said			0
" the world of science fiction continually inspires the real world in everything			0
" " @entity16 : @entity22 " is available for the @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255			1
it is scheduled for release on the @entity258 on november 18 in @entity259 and november 30 for @entity260 and @entity261 .			0
