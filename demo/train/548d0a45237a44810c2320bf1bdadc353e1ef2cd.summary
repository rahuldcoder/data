-- @entity2 is suggesting she , her husband and several aides were poisoned during a 2007 visit to @entity7 for the @entity8 , one of several new details in the former first lady 's forthcoming memoir , " @entity1			1
" due to hit bookshelves may 4 but purchased by @entity0 at a @entity15 - area bookstore , mrs. @entity2 says she and former president @entity16 became mysteriously sick on the @entity7 trip to such a degree that the president became bedridden			1
according to mrs. @entity2 , doctors and the @entity21 investigated the possibility a poisoning had occurred but were unable to make a definitive conclusion			1
news reports filed during the event show the @entity27 did disclose @entity16 missed a series of morning sessions at the summit because he had contracted an apparent virus , but @entity27 officials did not provide further details at that time			2
@entity34 : @entity16 illness investigated , poisoning unlikely " nearly a dozen members of our delegation were stricken , even @entity16 , who started to feel sick during an early morning staff briefing , " mrs. @entity2 writes			1
" [ @entity41 ] ne of our military aides had difficulty walking and a @entity27 staffer lost all hearing in one ear			2
exceedingly alarmed , the @entity21 went on full alert , combing the resort for potential poisons			0
" " @entity16 felt so ill that he met with [ @entity51 president @entity50 ] @entity52 and did not even stand up to greet him , " she continues , adding later , " we never learned if any other delegations became ill , or if ours , mysteriously , was the only one			2
" excerpts of the book were first published by @entity59 on tuesday			1
the 432 - page memoir is both a recount of the rare experience of being a first lady and a reflection of the eight years she spent in the @entity27 as her husband 's popularity gradually declined			1
among the book 's most poignant passages are those that delve into mrs. @entity2 's involvement in a 1963 car collision in @entity73 , @entity74 , that killed her good friend who happened to be driving the other car			1
the spotty details surrounding the accident became fodder for @entity16 's opponents during his first run for the @entity27 , and mrs. @entity2 rarely addressed the matter in public			1
mrs. @entity2 covers the accident extensively in the memoir , revealing it occurred after she ran a stop sign in a rush to a drive - in theater			1
then 17 , mrs. @entity2 was driving a car that collided with that of @entity92 , a fellow student at mrs. @entity2 's school			1
@entity92 was pronounced dead when he arrived at the hospital			0
" in the aftermath , all i felt was guilty , very guilty			0
in fact , i still do			0
it is a guilt i will carry for the rest of my life , far more visible to me than the scar etched in the bump of my knee , " mrs. @entity2 writes			1
" the whole time i was praying that the person in the other car was alive			2
in my mind , i was calling ' please , @entity106			0
please , @entity106 , ' over and over and over again			0
" mrs. @entity2 writes she and a friend were talking when she ran the stop sign but also says the intersection was highly dangerous , the road was dark , and she could barely see the stop sign			1
guilt - ridden , mrs. @entity2 says she lost her faith for " many , many years			1
" " it was the first time that i had prayed to @entity106 for something , begged him for something , not the simple childhood wishing on a star but humbly begging for another human life			0
and it was as if no one heard			0
my begging , to my seventeen - year - old mind , had made no difference			2
the only answer was the sound of mrs. @entity127 's sobs on the other side of that thin emergency room curtain			2
" much of the book 's early chapters are devoted to a recounting of family history , with a special emphasis on the tragedies faced by her family as they weathered the @entity137 and her own personal beginnings as a young woman coming of age in @entity73 , @entity74			2
mrs. @entity2 writes passionately about the time she spent after college teaching minority students in the large cities of @entity74 , before she met her future husband			1
mrs. @entity2 also reveals that she initially received a cold reception from @entity146 after marrying her son			1
" [ f ] rom the start , she was ferociously tart - tongued			1
she 's never shied away from saying what she thinks , " @entity16 writes			0
" she 's managed to insult nearly all of my friends with one or another perfectly - timed acerbic comment			0
" the relationship improved , however , when @entity2 and @entity16 moved to @entity15 to be closer to his parents , she writes			2
the memoir covers in detail many of the policy initiatives that the first lady undertook while in office , including her efforts to promote women 's rights in @entity162 and childhood literacy in the @entity164			0
the first lady also acknowledges a misstep made by her twin daughters , who were caught trying to order alcoholic drinks in @entity168 , @entity74 , before their 21st birthday			2
" that night in @entity168 was just dumb , in the way that so many nineteen - year - olds are dumb , " mrs. @entity2 writes			1
" but what bothered me long after the incident was over was the image left behind in the public mind , that @entity146 and @entity176 were party girls			2
" much as she did during her time as first lady , mrs. @entity2 for the most part avoids commenting on politics			1
but she does point to the 1992 presidential campaign of @entity182 as being particularly nasty			0
mrs. @entity2 writes that during the campaign , critics created " the most hideous caricatures of @entity182 until i barely recognized my own father - in - law			1
" @entity16 also criticizes former presidential candidate @entity187 for mentioning the sexual orientation of vice president @entity190 's daughter during a 2004 debate , calling the move " cheap and tawdry " and suggests the campaign opened the door to a more hostile atmosphere for political candidates and their families			0
" the strategy of making @entity199 's private life an issue failed with the voters in november of 2004 , " @entity16 writes			0
" but in the years since , it has become acceptable to mock candidates and their families , and other elected officeholders , in highly personal ways ; @entity206 feels free to ridicule @entity208 's teenage daughters , and the audience laughs			0
that is the legacy of the 2004 campaign			0
" mrs. @entity2 also uses the memoir to air a few gripes against her husband 's most vocal congressional critics , specifically @entity217 majority leader @entity216 and @entity27 speaker @entity218			1
@entity216 once called @entity16 a " loser , " while @entity218 said he was an " incompetent leader			0
" " the comments were uncalled for and graceless , " @entity16 writes			0
" while a president 's political opponents , as well as his supporters , are entitled to make what they see as legitimate criticisms , and while our national debates should be spirited , these particular worlds revealed the petty and parochial nature of some who serve in @entity231			0
" " @entity16 , as president , would never have used such language about them , " she adds			0
president @entity16 's own memoir , " @entity237 , " is set for a november 2010 release .			0

@entity59 : book says she and husband became ill , husband bedridden , in @entity7
@entity2 says 1963 car crash in @entity74 that killed *schoolmate* caused loss of faith
criticism of president from @entity217 majority leader , @entity27 speaker graceless , she says
mrs. @entity2 says her mother - in - law , @entity146 , can be " ferociously tart - tongued "
