-- @entity1 is ceo of @entity2 , one of the leading logistics and transportation companies in the @entity6 and south @entity7			1
he founded @entity2 in 1982 and 15 years later it went onto become the first company from the @entity10 world to go public on the @entity13 @entity12 stock exchange			1
in 2002 , @entity1 , in collaboration with private equity firm @entity15 , took the company private			1
today @entity2 is a public company again , trading on the @entity17			1
between 2003 to 2005 , he was the @entity6 and @entity20 area chairman of the @entity21			1
and he continues to be actively involved in community socio - economic development and @entity24 work in the region			1
@entity0 's @entity26 talks to @entity1 , one of the leading entrepreneurs in the region , on the importance of developing an entrepreneurial spirit			1
@entity30 : @entity2 is now about 25 years old			1
you were among the first entrepreneurs , especially when it comes to service - based industries , in the region			1
how pressing a need is there to develop entrepreneurship in the region ? @entity1 : i think it 's extremely pressing			1
i think it 's extremely important that entrepreneurs are nurtured in the region			1
they need to be looked after and they need to be taught now to be entrepreneurs , the new students			0
the youth of the @entity10 world needs to understand that entrepreneurship is the way to get out of the stifling job market that is being looked at today			1
because historically the @entity10 world , the region , had been a place where most people look for governments to employ them			1
this means very little innovation , very little space for creating news jobs			0
and in today 's world , governments are unable to employ			0
they do n't want to employ			0
if we are going to hire the hundred million people that are going to come into the job market in the coming 20 years , we 're going to have to tell them that they 're going to have to create their own businesses			1
se : what changes have you seen in the @entity10 business climate since you 've started ? @entity74 : you can think of the @entity10 world pre- 9/11 and post- 9/11 as far as the business climate			1
post 9/11 , which is a blessing , because suddenly the @entity10 world decided to invest in the @entity10 world			1
@entity10 capital decided to look for opportunities within the @entity10 world and decided to take risks on the @entity10 world			1
and the boom that you see in the region is a direct result of the @entity10 world finally being convinced that the opportunities are here and not anywhere else			1
and that 's what makes a big difference			0
that 's what 's making @entity93 at the end of the day ; that 's what 's making @entity97 ; @entity98 in terms of the new business boom that is happening			0
and at the same time there is , i think , a talent and brain regain in the region			2
we 've gotten a lot of experienced @entity110 - educated , or @entity110 - employed talented people			2
they want to come back here and that is because the business opportunity is here			0
and the biggest loss of the @entity10 world was to have lost its brain			1
i see a very strong trend of people coming back			0
se : is that changing the face of business in the region ? @entity74 : absolutely			2
it 's changing the face of business in the region because you 're bringing habits of modern economies , of developed economies into economies that are developing			2
it 's not that we do n't have our own capabilities , but we need a lot of help			0
we need people to come back and tell us what is happening outside of our region : how big companies have made it ; how big governments outside of our region have made it			2
se : and that 's partially what you benefited from listing on the @entity12 and being the first and only @entity10 company to list on the @entity12			1
you did develop , learn and bring back with you these @entity110 standards of best practices			0
when talking about @entity110 management practices , i need to be careful			0
but the reality is that modern management is a @entity110 concept			0
what i did when i went public on @entity12 is say that companies from the region can make it over there			2
se : was there increased pressure from the market and from shareholders to constantly deliver quarter - on - quarter ? did you want to take more long - term strategic decisions that maybe would n't immediately show high turnover ? @entity74 : sure			1
the entrepreneurial spirit may have been a little bit stifled when we were on @entity12 because of the pressure of quarter - to - quarter			2
but we 're also a public company today and we still continue to live quarter - to - quarter but maybe with less pressure because the research community on public companies is not as pressurizing as the community in the @entity177			1
but i would n't make it that big an issue			0
but being part of a private equity firm for three years , a lot of entrepreneurship was pushed because private equity by nature pushes you to grow and pushes you to take risks			2
if a shareholder wants you to take risks , then you are going to take risks			0
when you are public , shareholders are much more conservative than when you are private			0
se : when you began you really started as a niche business supporting global players			0
now you 've become a very significant player regionally and you 've expanded to other markets as well , such as in south @entity7			0
how can you and will you be able to compete with the big boys like @entity196 and @entity197 in mature markets ? @entity74 : sure , we think we have the product , the services and quality of global standard			0
the brand is not recognized , but the brand can be built			0
we 've been able to build what we have in 25 years , competing with the giants in our traditional markets			0
we 're competing in @entity209 for instance			0
@entity209 is a massive market that has all the big boys in it and we have a respectable share of the international express market			2
so we 're also taking those habits and our presence into not only south @entity7 but into southeast @entity7			0
we 're going to build a @entity219 company and we 're looking at acquiring a company in the @entity13			2
we 've also , as you know , acquired a company in @entity223 that has a @entity225 base			2
se : and what do you think is really the key change that needs to take place in the region in the coming years in order to create a more vibrant , viable regional economy ? @entity74 : i think the region needs to decide what it 's going to do with the extra cash that it has			2
if we continue to invest in real - estate then i 'm worried			1
if we 're not going to invest in our people , if we 're not going to invest in our youth , if we 're not going to change the way we invest in our youth , we 're going to be in trouble			1
that is the single biggest challenge that the @entity10 world has			1
it is what we are teaching our students , our youth , the people that are going to come into the economy in the coming 20 years			2
are we going to teach them skills that will allow them to create their own jobs , that will allow them to become entrepreneurs , that will allow them to become business people , to become innovators , to become creators ? or are we going to continue to think that the traditional way of making money is the only way ? we need to move from the hard asset mentality to the soft mentality of investment			0
and this is a long - term investment and this is a window of opportunity that has opened for us			0
the blessing of the oil price needs to be continuously looked at as a blessing in investing in the youth			0
it will be a curse if we do n't take advantage of that extra cash and invest it in the future by investing in people			0

@entity1 is ceo of @entity2 , the leading logistics company in the @entity6
entrepreneurship is route for @entity10 youth to *escape* stifling job market , he says
region must invest in youth . " if we continue to invest in real - estate , i 'm worried . "
