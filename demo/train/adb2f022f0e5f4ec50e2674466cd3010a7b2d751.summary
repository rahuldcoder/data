" your dad is off fighting for this country			2
" the boy replied , " as soon as he gets home , we 're going to go on a camping trip , just me and him			2
" @entity12 can not stop replaying that scene in her mind			0
that 's because only a few days later , on saturday night , she was cradling her boy who was crying once again			2
except this time she could not tell him that his father was coming home			1
she had just received a call informing her that @entity3 was one of the 30 @entity34 who died that afternoon when their @entity36 helicopter was shot down in @entity37 in east - central @entity4			1
" it was just so devastating that a week ago or so @entity1 had that worried look on his face , thinking about his dad , " she said			1

@entity1 was in his room , still awake and playing			1
@entity12 walked toward the room , and stood by his door for a moment , overcome with grief			0

@entity12 pulled herself together as best she could and phoned her brother who lives nearby			0
he came to her house to support her			0
together , they called @entity1 downstairs			1
in his pajamas , @entity1 stood in front of his mother and uncle			1
" i said , ' @entity1 , do you know much your dad loves you ? do you know how proud of you he is ? " before she could say anything more , the boy wilted in her arms , sobbing			1
" i said , ' i 'm sorry ... your ... dad died			1
" the mother and son held each other and cried			0
an hour , maybe , went by			0
at one point @entity1 got off the couch and ambled over to a @entity89 puppy , @entity90 , that his mother bought him when his father got deployed			1
he held the dog for awhile			0
then he fell asleep for a bit , and she went out to their porch			0
the night gave way to day			0
on sunday morning , @entity12 and @entity1 watched the national news broadcast the first reports about the downing of a @entity36 helicopter			1
they listened to reporters say that 38 @entity34 and @entity4 service personnel were killed , including 22 @entity107			0
it was the single deadliest loss for @entity34 troops since the war in @entity4 began in late 2001			0
" @entity1 asked me why they were n't showing his dad 's picture like they were showing some of the other guys , " @entity12 told @entity0			1
" i told him it was because people had gone online and were posting photos			2
" that gave the boy an idea			0
the two went to the family computer			0
@entity1 started saying , " @entity124 ! @entity124 ! " like his father , @entity1 is an information sponge			1
he 's always on the hunt for facts , his loves the computer , and he likes watching the news , his mother said			2
