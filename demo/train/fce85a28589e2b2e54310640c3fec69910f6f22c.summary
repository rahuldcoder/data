-- @entity2 champion @entity1 has labeled @entity3 a " fat bum " after the @entity6 boxer suffered a humiliating one - round defeat to his heavyweight rival @entity8			1
the elder @entity8 brother was awarded a technical knockout after just three minutes of his @entity12 title defense on saturday night , much to the disappointment of the 19,000 - strong crowd ringside in @entity15			1
@entity3 , the 2004 @entity16 champion , was unbeaten in his last 17 professional fights , but appeared to injured himself after being floored by his 6ft 8in @entity20 opponent -- who was defending his title for the sixth time in his second reign as @entity12 champion			2
@entity26 's @entity1 -- who is preparing to face @entity27 in a unification bout later this year -- lost to @entity3 in the amateur ranks 10 years ago and has launched a damning critique of his one - time conqueror			1
@entity1 confirms showdown with @entity8 finally on " now that 's why you should n't have excess body fat ! a lean , 30 - years - old healthy athlete should n't have joints / ligament popping for no reason , " @entity1 wrote on his @entity37 website page			2
he continued : " he beat me 10 years ago when he weighed 46lbs less			0
he used to be ripped ! why become obese before a huge fight ? " @entity3 knew how to beat @entity44 , but years of obesity stopped him being able to execute			0
he will unfortunately go down as yet another fat bum			0
" after a promising opening two - and - a - half minutes of the much - anticipated encounter , @entity3 was caught by a right hook to his temple			2
like the crowd , the champion initially seemed angry that @entity3 could not carry on , but it quickly became clear he had hurt himself as he clutched onto his knee and hamstring while lying on the floor			0
according to the @entity59 news agency , it is now believed the 30 - year - old has sustained further damage to an already injured leg , and could potentially need surgery to repair the problem			1
@entity3 ' failed challenge has increased the pressure on @entity1 to defeat @entity67 and @entity68 heavyweight champion @entity27 -- and perhaps even take on the 39 - year - old @entity8 before his retirement in october -- in order to put an end to the brothers ' dominance in the sport			1
as the build - up to the long - awaited showdown continues , @entity27 , present at his brother 's fight in @entity77 , commented : " you can see why @entity1 chose to fight me and not my brother			0
" @entity1 is definitely going to say to @entity8 , ' i will fight you down the road but @entity27 is next because he is weaker '			0
