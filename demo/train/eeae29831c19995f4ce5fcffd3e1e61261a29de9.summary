@entity0 -- veterans groups are angry after president @entity3 told them monday that he is still considering a proposal to have treatment for service - connected injuries charged to veterans ' private insurance plans			1
president @entity3 , with @entity10 secretary @entity11 , spoke with leaders of veterans groups monday			1
leaders of the country 's most prominent veterans groups met monday at the @entity16 with @entity3 , @entity10 secretary @entity17 , white house chief of staff @entity19 and @entity20 , the director in charge of defense spending for the @entity23			1
some of the veterans groups were caught off guard when the president said the administration is still thinking about the idea as a way of generating $ 540 million for the @entity10 in 2010			1
the groups and some members of @entity31 have been very vocal in opposing the idea			2
the message , according to some of the people in the room , was that if the groups do not like this idea , they need to come back with another way of saving or raising revenue for the @entity10			1
" i got the distinct impression that the only hope of this plan not being enacted is for an alternative plan to be developed that would generate the desired $ 540 million in revenue , " cmdr			1
@entity48 of the @entity49 said in a written statement			0
but the chairman of the @entity52 vowed tuesday that the plan would never gain the panel 's approval			2
" @entity10 's sacred duty is to care for veterans injured in honorable service to our nation , and the department should not turn to wounded warriors ' private insurance to pay for combat injures , " said sen. @entity55 , @entity56			1
" under my chairmanship , the @entity66 will not advance any such legislation			0
" @entity16 spokesman @entity69 said no decision has been made			0
" the president and the [ veterans service organizations ] had a good conversation , and veterans can be assured that the president understands any concerns that they would have , " @entity69 said			1
" the budget the president has proposed represents an historic increase in discretionary spending to take care of our wounded warriors : those that have been sent off to war , have protected our freedom and have come back wounded			2
" he added , " this president takes very seriously the needs of our wounded warriors that have given so much to protect our freedom on the battlefields throughout the world			0
" @entity3 did most of the talking for the administration in the session with veterans representatives , participants said			1
@entity17 did not speak much in the meeting , which was described as " professional " by @entity100 , executive director of @entity101			0
the president was sympathetic to the needs of veterans , @entity100 said , but insisted that the insurance companies are getting away with not paying for anything			2
" the vets are paying premiums to insurance companies , and that is a free ride that needs to stop , " @entity100 said in describing the president 's message to the group			0
the groups oppose the idea because they believe that the government has a moral obligation to pay for service - connected injuries for the men and women who risked their lives serving the country			1
" this flies in the face of the @entity10 's covenant to cover all service - related health - care expenses , " said @entity124 , a spokesman for @entity125			1
the groups also say that the cost of treating service - connected injuries could lead to veterans quickly maxing out their benefits in third - party insurance , risking coverage for not just them but their families , who are also covered under the plans			1
in addition , they foresee premiums rising to cover the cost of treating the service - connected injuries			1
" we are going to go back in and fight this thing tooth and nail , " @entity100 said			0
he said the president complained that instead of commending the significant budget increase for the @entity10 -- an 11 percent increase in 2010 and $ 25 billion over five years -- the groups are complaining about this proposal			1
but @entity100 said that the issue of third - party billing is fundamental to the @entity10 and that it is a " distraction " from discussing the budget increases			1
another group , the @entity155 , said that although it is encouraged by the increase in money for veterans ' health care , the billing proposal is not acceptable			1
" veterans of all generations agree that this proposal is bad for the country and bad for veterans			2
if the president and the @entity23 want to cut costs , they can start at @entity171 , not the @entity10 , " said @entity166 , the group 's executive director , in a written statement			2
the opposition is not a surprise to the @entity16			0
the groups had sent a letter opposing the idea when it was just a rumor			2
last week , @entity31 weighed in when members of both the @entity16 and @entity179 committees told @entity17 at separate meetings that they objected to the plan			0
@entity17 was told by sen. @entity182 , @entity183 , that it would be " dead on arrival			0
" rep. @entity186 , @entity187 , said that if it were presented , he would oppose the entire budget			0
it is unconscionable , and it is an insult to our veterans who have been hurt overseas , " @entity186 said			0
" it is just unbelievable that anyone would ever think of doing that in this budget			0
" at the time , @entity17 would say only that the idea was under consideration but no decision had been made			0
the groups have another meeting with the @entity16 on thursday to suggest other options			0
both @entity125 and @entity101 believe that the @entity10 could raise more revenue by being more aggressive about pursuing billings for non-service - connected treatments			1
increasing third - party billing for non-service related injuries by 10 percent , suggested @entity124 , would free up more money to help service - related injuries			1
another idea that will be presented would be to bill @entity212			0
" this , we believe , would more easily meet the president 's financial goal , " said @entity48 , of the @entity49			0
@entity100 said his group is willing to concede some money in the @entity10 budget to avoid the insurance proposal			2
" if it comes down to this issue , which is fundamental to the @entity10 and what it should do , we are willing to give up a couple billion to salvage this issue , " @entity100 said			2
a @entity10 spokesman deferred all questions to the @entity16			2
@entity16 officials were not immediately available for comment			0
@entity1 's @entity230 contributed to this report			0
