-- @entity1 is on track to become @entity4 's youngest double world champion after topping the qualifying timesheets for sunday 's @entity6			1
the 24 - year - old headed off @entity8 teammate @entity7 to claim his 11th pole position this season as he seeks a ninth victory from 14 races			1
that would give him another championship crown -- the first was clinched at the last race of 2010 , but this one would be with five to go as he seeks to build on his 112 - point lead in the night event			2
@entity1 can beat the mark of second - placed @entity19 , who was 25 when he won his second title with @entity21 in 2006			1
but the @entity22 could delay @entity1 's celebrations if he finishes fourth on a testing @entity24 where he led from the start to win last year from @entity1 and @entity7 -- and also triumphed with @entity21 in 2008			1
how the @entity4 title can be won : @entity1 on the verge @entity19 will have to improve on saturday 's qualifying , where he was fifth fastest ahead of @entity30 teammate @entity29			1
@entity8 team boss @entity31 downplayed chances of the title being decided this weekend			2
" the moon and stars have got to line up			0
we have n't booked anything for a party should we win			0
we 're focused on the race , " he told reporters in quotes carried by @entity42			0
@entity1 set the pace in the first two sessions before clocking an unbeatable one minute 44.381 seconds in his only run of @entity47 to give @entity8 a perfect record in qualifying this season			1
@entity1 fastest in @entity51 practice " i decided to abort my second run when i made a mistake because it is very easy to damage the car so i went wide , " he said			0
" i was quite happy with my first lap. i think the circuit ramped up at the end and i think it was possible to go faster , but i 'm very happy			0
it 's a very difficult track with such a long lap to get everything right			0
i think we learned from our mistakes that we made last year			0
" @entity7 then surged into second with 1:44.732 to push past @entity65 's former world champions @entity66 ( 1:44.804 ) and @entity67 ( 1:44.809 )			1
@entity67 was unable to make a second run due to a fuel problem , and watched from the pits as his time was beaten			0
@entity19 timed 1:44.874 to be well clear of @entity29 ( 1:45.800 ) and the @entity73 of @entity74 -- whose legendary teammate @entity72 failed to set a time along with @entity77 's @entity76 and @entity78 -- who both opted to conserve tires .			2

@entity1 wins his 11th pole position of 2011 at @entity82
@entity85 heads home @entity8 teammate @entity7 in saturday qualifying
@entity1 is *hoping* to secure his second world title in 14th of 19 races this season
@entity30 's @entity19 can deny him by finishing fourth in the night race
