@entity0 -- the once - taboo topic of @entity4 's exit from the common currency is now being openly discussed			1
two years of pushing cash into the country have barely kept it afloat and the collapse of political talks this week injected a new urgency into the situation			0
the potential for a run on the banks increased with the admission by the country 's president @entity17 that up to â ‚ ¬ 800 million ( $ 900 million ) , was pulled out of the banks monday			1
it is a tiny slice of total deposits but a trend , @entity17 noted , that could create " fear that could develop into panic			0
" @entity4 , which is facing its fifth year of recession , will go to a second election june 17 after its may 6 voting left no single party with more than 20 % support and negotiations to create a unity government failed			1
an interim government has now been sworn in			0
an unplanned exit from the eurozone could cost up to $ 1 trillion , according to @entity36 , of the @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity39 noted : " the end of the euro in its current form is a certainty			2
a currency with the name euro may survive but even if it does it will be radically transformed			1
" negotiations between @entity4 and its lenders might seem a game of chicken , and analysts remains skeptical the end - game is near			1
but the odds are increasing -- gaming house @entity53 even stopped taking bets on a @entity4 exit from the eurozone -- despite the legal , financial and political difficulties			1
@entity1 explains how it could happen			0
legal hurdles @entity4 could be forced to exit the @entity61 , rather than just the common currency itself , because one comes hand in hand with the other			1
the @entity66 has the exclusive right to issue euro notes , for example , so any move by @entity4 to print its own currency would immediately put it in breach of the treaty			1
changing the treaty would take some time , so a more likely maneuver is an agreement between euro nations on when and how they would boot @entity4 out of the bloc			1
according to @entity82 , partner at @entity83 , " the dam has burst , because so many people are now talking about [ an exit ]			2
it is not a possibility that can be ignored			0
" however the legal difficulties mean " any solution would have to take place effectively outside this document			0
" a withdrawal from the eurozone by @entity4 " would be breach of the treaty without any question , " @entity82 added			1
" but these things happen			0
" getting back the small change @entity4 could revert to the drachma -- the currency it had before entering the euro in 2001 -- but there is also speculation it could operate with a @entity4 - specific euro until a full switch can take place			1
if @entity104 is used as a guide , this could be announced over a weekend			0
the banks could then remain shut for a fortnight while the currency transition is bedded in			2
at this point capital controls would need to be in place to ensure money in the country stays there			0
this could be done in co-ordination with other euro countries , or unilaterally			2
according to a @entity119 / @entity118 note , @entity4 banks have lost 30 % of their private sector deposits since their peak in late 2009			1
such capital flight is likely to be increasing and the fear -- as articulated by @entity17 -- is that an emotional response to the crisis will create even greater problems			0
as @entity137 's @entity136 , notes , " talk of firewalls and guarantees disappears in a puff of smoke if the challenge for banks is not liquidity , nor solvency , but an existential crisis			2
" the new currency would be worth significantly less -- estimates put it at perhaps 50 % -- than the euro			1
according @entity119 / @entity118 , the country could then issue @entity143 to pay salaries and recapitalize the banks			0
this , however , would risk the creation of a " shadow currency			2
" the note adds : " how long @entity4 could be within the euro and live with its own internal currency is an open debate			1
" once the new currency is in place , mortgages to @entity4 banks would likely be repaid in drachma , while repayments of mortgages to foreign banks may have to be renegotiated			1
the biggest issue could be foreign banks ' loans to major @entity4 businesses			1
debt which was previously due to be repaid in euros would have be renegotiated in drachma			0
legal disputes are likely to ensue as creditors battle to get back as much money as they can			0
payback time creditors attempting to squeeze their money out of @entity4 could be out of luck			1
the @entity171 and @entity66 are the country 's most senior creditors and defaulting on these debts would be politically unpalatable			2
but there are precedents : @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 , for example , remain in arrears to the @entity171			0
private creditors have already taken 50 % losses on their investments in @entity4 debt but are likely to face further reductions in repayments			2
money owed to @entity4 's eurozone peers , via the bailout fund , would likely be up for some ferocious negotiation			1
the flow - on effect the so - called " contagion effect " remains the greatest fear			0
allowing one country to exit the euro opens the floodgates for others to follow			2
this risk will push up the premium attached to buying sovereign debt of troubled eurozone economies -- such as that of @entity204 and @entity205 , whose ten year bonds are nudging toward the " danger zone " of 7 % yield -- on the back of the uncertainty			1
according to @entity214 , of @entity215 , the direct costs of @entity4 euro exit would be huge for @entity4 , but manageable for the rest of the bloc			1
" our concern is contagion , " she wrote in a note			0
the note said a forceful policy response would be needed in the case of a @entity4 exit , such as further strengthening of the bloc 's bailout fund			1
a @entity4 exit could also trigger shifts in geo - political influence , as countries such as @entity233 may step up with financial assistance			1
according to @entity235 , of @entity215 : " the risk is we may lose @entity4 from the @entity239 sphere of influence			2
" is @entity4 actually going to exit the euro ? the next few weeks will be vital for @entity4 , and the future of the eurozone			1
much depends on the results of the new election			0
@entity4 's @entity247 party -- which wants to remain in the eurozone but does not support the bailout program -- has thus far reaped the benefits of voter frustration with the austerity measures			1
it bumped out mainstream party @entity253 to come second in the may 6 election , with almost 17 %			2
opinion polls indicate it could come first in the next election			0
@entity258 , which supports the program , narrowly won the may 6 election with almost 19 % support			2
it could get a boost if sentiment shifts and fear of a euro exit drives @entity4 back to the mainstream parties			1
if this happens , the crisis could ease			0
economists remain unconvinced an exit is the next step			0
@entity235 believes the " huge poker game " between @entity4 and its creditors is set to continue			2
" there is still some distance to the last chance saloon , " he says			0
if it did , the consequences could be dire , @entity136 notes			0
he points to the bankruptcy of @entity279 , @entity280 's largest bank , in 1931			0
" that was the main cause for the @entity282			0
and this is the same sort of thing , " he says			0
economic shakedown a new currency would take some time to find its true value , as markets adjust to @entity4 being outside the eurozone bloc			1
in @entity104 's case , its break with the @entity292 dollar peg in 2002 -- which devalued the peso by 30 % -- sank its economy , with 60 % of @entity104 under the poverty line , according to the @entity297			0
however , the economy then rebounded around 8.5 % annually for six years			0
if @entity4 unshackles its currency it will become a more competitive exporter and an attractively cheap tourist destination			1
but @entity4 , who have suffered rising unemployment , brutal austerity measures and protests which have claimed lives , will be forced to pay higher prices for imported goods			2
the country 's economy -- which accounts for just 5 % of the @entity61 's economic output and relies on agriculture and tourism -- would likely take years to recover			0
@entity313 , @entity314 and @entity315 contributed to this report			0

once - taboo topic of @entity4 's exit from the common currency is now openly discussed
@entity4 , which is facing its fifth year of recession , will go to a second election june 17
support for *anti-austerity* *package* parties could push @entity4 toward a euro exit
one estimate puts the cost of an unplanned exit from the eurozone at up to $ 1trn
