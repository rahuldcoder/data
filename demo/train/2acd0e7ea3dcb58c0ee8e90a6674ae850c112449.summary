-- " style -- all who have it share one thing : originality			1
" with her heavily rouged cheeks , hawk nose , fondness for costume jewelry and quotable musings delivered with a smoker 's rasp , @entity6 is certainly regarded as an original			1
under her editorial watch , some of the most iconic images of our times were published : the first picture of the @entity21 as a presidential couple in @entity23 , @entity25 's pronounced profile on the cover of @entity27 and 19 - year - old up - and - comer @entity29 on the pages inside			1
@entity31 is the director of the new documentary " @entity6 : the eye has to @entity34 , " an intimate reflection and celebration of @entity6 's remarkable life and clout in the fashion scene			1
the film goes into limited @entity42 release today			0
in 1936 , @entity6 was hired as the fashion editor for @entity23 -- a position she would hold for 25 years before being named the editor - in - chief at @entity27			1
at 70 , after being fired from @entity27 rather brusquely and disdainful of the idea of retirement , she became a special consultant to @entity49 at the @entity50 until she died in 1989			1
@entity31 is married to @entity51 , @entity6 's grandson , but never got to meet @entity6 before she died			1
@entity31 spoke to @entity0 about the renowned tastemaker , her fabled life and how we could all dare to look at the world with a more astute eye			1
@entity0 : what made @entity6 's concept of beauty so revolutionary ? @entity31 : i think that @entity6 's definition of beauty was so open because she was such an open person			1
i think she understood what low and high culture was , and i think that 's one of the most important outlooks that she had because beauty does n't have to be just physical			1
beauty has to be deep down , it has to be soulful			0
it 's not about the dress you wear , it 's about the life you lead in the dress			1
i feel that is very important for what life is about			1
beauty transcends fashion , and in a sense , she transcended fashion			2
for her , it was an awareness of people , of people 's personalities , and that was one of the most important aspects that she had			2
@entity0 : in the case of ' 60s icons such as @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity29 , she was known for seeing things in them before they saw it in themselves			1
she also was n't afraid of pushing people 's " faults			2
" why was this so significant ? @entity31 : i think it 's about being your true self			2
whatever was real was what she was ultimately striving for			0
she was always looking at the layer underneath everything , even if that layer contained faults			0
for her , it was about the depth of a person that counted			0
she , of course , understood what real beauty was			0
for her , somebody like @entity93 , who was brought up in a good family in @entity122 , she saw a girl under there that was totally different			1
she was not the normal beauty			0
she really represented the ' 60s , which was original thought			2
@entity0 : she once said of style , " it helps you get down the stairs			2
it helps you get up in the morning			0
it 's a way of life			1
without it , you 're nobody			0
i 'm not talking about lots of clothes			0
" what can people learn from @entity6 about this concept of personal style ? @entity31 : i think you 're going to have to go with yourself -- especially today when you travel throughout the world and you find all the same stores everywhere			1
when @entity6 was around , it was about when you go to @entity147 , you can get certain things			1
it was about having your own sense of identity and , for her , that 's what counts			2
it 's about how you 're living your life in that dress			1
it 's about the decisions that you 're making			2
if you 're comfortable with this , then everybody else should be comfortable with this			0
do n't forget , she was not this remarkable beauty -- and that was one of her driving forces			0
she grew up with a mother who was very difficult -- she not only called her " her ugly little monster " but then continued to challenge her			0
in fact , when she was married to @entity170 ( @entity6 ) , and he was just unbelievably handsome , the same day in the gossip columns in @entity122 , it was announced that her mother was having a huge affair			1
so , all the attention was taken away from @entity6 on her wedding day and put on her mother			1
she understood you have to trust yourself , believe in yourself and that , for me , is fundamentally what her message is			0
@entity0 : on " the @entity182 " in the late ' 70s , @entity6 said , " @entity183 is part of the daily air and it changes all the time , with all the events			1
you can even see the approaching of a revolution in clothes			0
you can see and feel everything in clothes			0
" what do you think she meant by that ? @entity31 : it 's interesting because shoes and clothes are like this			2
you can see what 's going on in history through all of these things			2
it shows and marks what 's going on socially , culturally and politically during that time and in the end , when she was doing these shows at the @entity50 's @entity49 , she was educating us on those periods of history			2
if you look at the ' 60s , it 's clear it 's the ' 60s			1
if you look at @entity215 , you know that it 's the ' 40s and the ' 50s			2
she 's making us aware that clothes show us so much more of history			2
@entity0 : why do you think her legacy has remained relevant ? @entity31 : this is a message of life			0
this is the oracle side of her			0
she is talking about life , about passion , about being driven			0
we should n't be driven by ambition , but for a discovery of the world			0
i think that the title of the film , " the eye has to @entity34 , " it 's about the mind traveling , it 's about having imagination , it 's about fantasy			1
and this is not anything that has to do with fashion ; she transcends fashion			0
i think we could stand to be inspired			0
i think we 're living in such a moment of lack of inspiration ; i think it 's crazy			0
it 's not only because we 're all stuck behind computers all day , including myself			0
we 're not looking , we 're not observing , there 's so much more to life			1
she used fashion to give a message .			0
