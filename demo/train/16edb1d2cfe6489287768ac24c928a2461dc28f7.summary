-- when @entity3 majority leader @entity2 announced he would be pushing for a public option in the final health care bill , it looked as if he had given up on the possibility of a bipartisan agreement			1
most @entity8 have been steadfast in their opposition to the @entity11 health care proposals			1
the only serious possibility for @entity8 backing has come from sen. @entity14 of @entity15			1
while expressing support for much of the @entity18 bill , she has said she would accept a public option only if private markets and new regulations fail to control costs and lower premiums			0
@entity2 's decision is not a sign of commitment to an ideal but rather an act of political realism			1
the notion that either party will be able to find substantive bipartisan support for legislation today is dubious			1
the political forces that generate partisan conflict in @entity36 are deeply rooted and hard to change			1
partisanship is not always a bad thing for politics			0
strong parties can give voters real choices at the ballot box , and party leaders are willing to push for bold objectives that centrists often avoid			2
but bipartisanship is also a valuable objective , and good to have as part of our political mix. when both parties are open to sometimes entering into negotiations and reaching agreements , this improves the chances for major policy breakthroughs that will last over time			2
when @entity58 see that their leaders are willing , under the right circumstances , to focus on doing what the country needs even if the other side might receive more credit , citizens are exposed to a side of government that is usually overshadowed by the political machinations that dominate the news			0
but the pressures against bipartisanship are enormous			2
gerrymandered congressional districts favor representatives who play to the party base			2
the number of centrists in both parties has steadily diminished			0
the campaign finance system empowers party leaders and conservative activists who are able to raise and distribute substantial amounts of campaign funds to pay for television ads and get - out - the - vote operations			2
within the @entity8 , their power was recently on display in @entity88 's 23rd district			1
conservatives pressured centrist @entity8 @entity90 to step down from the special election to clear the way for @entity94 candidate @entity93 , who has received the strong support of national conservative groups			1
" @entity93 's campaign , " @entity98 chairman @entity102 announced , " will receive the financial backing of the @entity98 and get - out - the - vote efforts to defeat @entity100 on tuesday			0
" in the @entity3 , the constant threat of the filibuster offers the minority party an easy way to thwart the agenda			2
the media favors stories about conflict over consensus			0
people tend to be a nostalgic for moments when the two major parties worked together			0
in fact , this has rarely been the case			0
but when there were periods with some bipartisanship in the 20th century , what is striking is how much more substantial they were			2
they involved significant numbers of legislators from one party joining forces with the other			1
one of the most famous examples of bipartisan leadership involved @entity131 sen. @entity131 , who in 1947 and 1948 chaired the @entity132			0
@entity131 worked with president @entity133 to pass some of the key policies of the @entity135 , including the @entity136 , the @entity137 and the @entity138			0
many republicans disagreed with @entity131 , focusing much more on attacking @entity133			0
but @entity131 still delivered @entity8 votes for that short period			1
during the @entity3 vote on the @entity138 in 1948 , which provided economic assistance to help rebuild @entity144 , 31 @entity8 joined 38 @entity145 to vote for the bill			1
the same held true with the @entity147			0
we often remember the important work of @entity150 sen. @entity150 , an @entity152 conservative who joined forces with @entity155 in the summer of 1964 to vote for cloture to end the filibuster by @entity145			1
@entity150 was one of 27 republicans who voted to end the filibuster and then to vote for civil rights			0
today , discussions of bipartisanship focus on obtaining one or two votes from the opposition party			1
this is a phenomenon we have seen intensifying since the 1970s			0
republicans also had trouble obtaining @entity11 votes under president @entity169			0
until politicians are able to deal with some of the underlying forces that make bipartisanship difficult to achieve , party leaders should not give so much weight to legislative strategies that hinge on appealing to the other side			1
seriously searching for bipartisanship , for example , would require reforming the campaign finance system so that legislators are not in such desperate need of private campaign contributions , over which party leaders and activist organizations maintain tight control			1
citizens should also support media outlets that place solid journalism above partisan analysis			0
right now , bipartisan votes are not coming			0
in the past few weeks , @entity145 seem to have come to this conclusion and are now focusing more on what will unite their own party than what will win sen. @entity14 's vote			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity199 says @entity2 appeared to be giving up on bipartisanship
he says @entity145 are more focused on unity than on attracting @entity8 votes
bipartisanship once involved many legislators crossing party lines
today , @entity199 says , many forces make bipartisanship hard to achieve
