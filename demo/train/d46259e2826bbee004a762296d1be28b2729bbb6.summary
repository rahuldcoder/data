-- as sens. @entity3 and @entity4 battle over who has the best approach to national security , a new @entity0 poll finds @entity9 ' concerns about terrorism have hit an all - time low for the post-september 11 era			1
a poll finds fewer @entity9 fear an imminent terror attack than at any time since september 11 , 2001			1
according to a @entity15 survey released wednesday , 35 percent of @entity9 believe a terrorist attack somewhere in the @entity9 is likely over the next several weeks			1
the figure is the lowest in a @entity0 poll since the september 11 , 2001 , @entity20 attacks , which killed nearly 3,000 people			1
between 2002 and 2006 , summertime polls typically showed that a majority of @entity9 believed that a terrorist attack was likely			2
last summer , that figure dropped to 41 percent			0
this summer , it dropped another 6 percentage points			0
the latest @entity0 poll also indicates that the war in @entity30 remains deeply unpopular			1
three in 10 voters favor the war , while 68 percent oppose it			0
similarly , a third of voters would like to see the next president keep the same number of troops in @entity30 that are stationed there now			0
see how the poll numbers stack up Â» for @entity3 , who is seeking to highlight his national security credentials and has staunchly defended the @entity9 presence in @entity30 , the latest poll results may not be viewed in a positive light			1
" sen. @entity3 's greatest strength is in foreign policy , particularly his reputation as the candidate best able to fight the war on terror , " said @entity42 , @entity0 's polling director			1
" as the threat of a terrorist attack continues to recede in the mind of the @entity9 voter , the state of the economy and other domestic issues are likely to become even more important			2
that would be good news for sen. @entity4 , since the @entity58 currently beat or tie the @entity59 on every issue except terrorism			0
" another potential problem for @entity3 may be found in president @entity64 's latest job approval ratings			2
according to the survey , 30 percent of @entity9 approve of how @entity64 is handling his job , while 68 percent disapprove of @entity64 's job performance			1
these numbers are roughly consistent with the president 's approval ratings over most of the last two years			0
they also reinforce the need for the presumptive @entity59 nominee to create an impression of distance and distinction between himself and @entity64			0
democrats , on the other hand , are eager to tie @entity3 to the unpopular outgoing president and portray his possible election as the equivalent of a third @entity64 term			0
the poll , conducted thursday through sunday by phone , surveyed 1,026 adult @entity9 and carries a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .			2

@entity0 / @entity15 survey finds fewer @entity9 think attack imminent
percentage who *expect* attack is lowest since september 11 , 2001
survey also finds strong *opposition* to @entity98 , current troop levels in @entity30
