the announcement that @entity2 's prime minister , @entity1 , will run for president in next march 's election and will , if elected , appoint the current president , @entity5 , as his prime minister brings to mind one of the most famous lines of @entity10 literature			1
in @entity13 's novel " @entity12 , " set in 19th century @entity14 , a young nobleman tells his conservative uncle that clinging to the past will not work			2
" if we want things to stay as they are , " he says , " things will have to change			2
" the @entity21 's proposed game of musical chairs is the kind of change whose only purpose is to keep things as they are			2
@entity1 and company have made clear for years that they do not intend to leave the scene quietly in 2012 when @entity5 's presidential term expires			1
the only question was in what configuration the two leaders would return			0
to stay in the same positions would have smacked of stagnation			0
switching places , although hardly an inspired move , is the simplest way to stir the waters without fear of rocking the boat			0
it will provoke a temporary burst of indignation from @entity1 's many critics in the @entity47 , some of whom saw in @entity5 a champion of liberalism and civil rights			1
some will predict a tightening of authoritarian rule			0
yet the reality is that @entity1 's return to the @entity21 will not , in itself , change much			1
for the last four years , he has made all key decisions , with @entity5 's advice , and he will continue to do so			1
those who imagine that a second @entity5 term would have produced dramatic breakthroughs face the problem of explaining why his first term did not			1
unless @entity68 leaders seek to punish @entity1 for his return , there is no reason to think it will undermine the " reset " of recent years			1
improved relations with the @entity73 could not have been pursued had @entity1 not approved of the policy			1
despite rumors of disagreements between the two leaders -- or , more often , their aides -- @entity1 and @entity5 have always worked together as a close - knit team			1
ordinary @entity2 understand this well			1
fifty - eight percent think stories about conflicts between the two are dreamed up by journalists and opposition politicians			0
seventy - three percent see @entity5 as having continued @entity1 's policies rather than introducing new ones of his own			1
both want to make @entity2 a strong , modern country and understand the need for an efficient economy linked into global markets and capital flows			1
at the same time , both want to protect a circle of friends and acquaintances who have grown rich during their years in power			0
obviously , these two goals at times conflict			0
to maintain their popularity , the two leaders have employed a political division of labor			0
@entity1 's priority has been to keep mainstream @entity2 loyal			1
his occasional @entity106 jibes and earthy aphorisms aim to appeal to provincial sensibilities			0
but his main weapon has been money			0
during the financial crisis , the prime minister spent lavishly to soften the pain , increasing pensions by 24 % in real terms in 2009 and another 13 % in 2010			1
although the economy shrank by 8 % in 2009 , government spending grew from 34 to 41 % of gdp			0
@entity2 ' real disposable income rose by 2 % in 2009 and almost 5 % in 2010			2
the strategy has largely worked			0
although @entity1 's -- and @entity5 's -- approval ratings have fallen in the last two years , the decline has been relatively slow			1
the latest polls by the respected @entity124 show that 68 % still approve of @entity1 's performance while 63 % approve of @entity5 's			1
barring a sudden collapse , this should be enough to get @entity1 comfortably through next march 's election , even without the predictable electoral irregularities			2
but the support , although high , is thin , resting on economic performance and little else			0
@entity2 are worried about the future			2
even as the economy stabilized after the worst of the global crisis , the percentage who think the country is heading in the right direction fell during the past year from 48 % to 36 %			0
@entity5 's political constituency has been the urban , educated elites in business , academia , the arts , and other spheres			2
he has courted them with articulate interviews , technology incubators , and tweets about modernization			0
the problem is that , after years of empty promises and speeches , almost all have given up on him			0
as prime minister , @entity5 will be plunged into the operational details of managing the economy at an unusually tricky moment			1
although @entity2 achieved growth of 4 % last year , it is not clear how long it can continue at this rate without major reforms to restore battered investor confidence			2
oil and gas output is unlikely to increase much in coming years , especially if growth in the developed economies stalls			0
aware of this , the two leaders have already announced reforms to simplify rules for investors and privatize large stakes in state - owned companies			0
@entity5 's first task will probably be implementing unpopular cuts to rein in public spending			2
he may have to back away from a commitment to triple defense expenditures -- a promise that prompted @entity177 , the long - serving finance minister and leading budget hawk , to say he would refuse to serve under @entity5			1
the need to trim social spending threatens to turn @entity5 into a lightning rod for discontent , and could shorten his tenure			2
yet there is also the chance that he will survive for long enough to see reforms bear fruit -- and claim a share of the credit			0
having visibly chafed at the lack of levers to get his policies implemented , he will now get opportunities to implement some himself			0
how effective he proves in this new role -- and how much leeway @entity1 allows him -- remain to be seen .			1

@entity1 will run for @entity2 president ; @entity5 to become prime minister
@entity200 says the change is mostly about preserving the status *quo*
he says @entity1 and @entity5 both *recognize* the *importance* of keeping economy growing
@entity200 : the two work together , *dividing* up tasks in *bid* to remain in power
