-- @entity1 is dipping its toes in the camera market with the new re : a supersimple handheld action camera that pairs with a smartphone			1
the l - shaped re camera looks like an inhaler or small periscope			1
just under 4 inches high , the waterproof gadget is mostly handle			2
it turns on when you grip it and features a fixed ultra-wide - angle lens , a single button and no viewfinder			1
it captures 16 megapixel still images and shoots 1080p hd videos at 30 frames per second or 720p videos at 120 frames per second			0
though it works independently , the re does a lot more when used with its @entity27 or @entity28 apps			0
the apps can turn a smartphone into a viewfinder and make it possible to shoot time - lapse and slow motion videos			2
why is @entity1 , traditionally a smartphone company , making a camera ? in a way , all smartphone makers are already in the camera industry			1
starting with @entity41 's @entity40 , smartphone manufacturers have mostly obliterated the point - and - shoot by putting powerful cameras in everyone 's pocket			0
part of the problem was that traditional pocket cameras just could n't catch up fast enough with the editing and instant sharing features smartphones offered			0
@entity1 is approaching its camera from a different angle : it 's built as a phone accessory			1
though aimed at a more casual user , @entity24 is similar to the many portable action cameras available			2
led by the hugely popular @entity58 , action cameras have taken off in recent years			1
rugged and powerful , they can be mounted on vehicles , heads and animals for intense videos			0
like @entity58 , the @entity24 will have a line of custom mounts and clips			1
it can shoot up to 1 meter underwater			0
@entity1 says the camera will be available before the end of the year and cost $ 199			1
it comes in white , navy and red			0
the @entity74 company announced the new camera on wednesday , along with the @entity77 smartphone			2
built to capitalize on the selfie craze , the @entity77 puts its most powerful camera on the front side of the phone , so people can get the highest quality image of their face and make sure they look good at the same time .			0
