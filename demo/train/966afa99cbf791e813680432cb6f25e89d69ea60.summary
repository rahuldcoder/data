-- the next wave of smartphones and tablets might have super-sturdy screens fashioned from the human - made version of a gemstone			1
manufactured sapphire , a substance already used to armor some military vehicles , would be an almost unbreakable alternative to the glass now used on the displays of mobile devices , according to a report in the @entity16			1
@entity17 is the second - hardest material on the planet , behind only diamond			0
according to the @entity16 report , a sapphire smartphone screen would n't break when you dropped it and could n't be scratched with a car key or by a sidewalk			1
" i 'm convinced that some ( manufacturers ) will start testing the water and release some high - end smartphones using sapphire in 2013 , " @entity26 , an analyst for the market research firm @entity27 , said in the report			2
currently , @entity34 uses manufactured sapphire to protect the camera lens on its @entity37			1
manufactured sapphire is made by melting down aluminum oxide , the compound that crystallizes into sapphire in nature , allowing it to cool and then cutting it with a diamond - coated wire saw			2
one stumbling block could be price			0
currently , a sapphire display for a smartphone would cost about $ 30 , compared with $ 3 for the screens made by @entity50 's @entity49 , the protective cover that 's on more than 1 billion devices			1
the @entity16 report estimates that sapphire would be about three times stronger than @entity49			1
but @entity50 spokesman @entity55 said the company is n't too worried			0
" it is unclear to us if this could provide better overall performance than actual glass , " he wrote in an e-mail			0
" there also are the questions about cost and product weight that must be addressed before sapphire would be a serious consideration for mass market applications			0
" @entity55 noted that @entity49 can be molded into curved designs and multiple shapes without losing its strength , and he questioned whether the same could be said for manufactured sapphire			1
the company says its most recent product , @entity49 3 , will be in phones this year and is twice as strong as previous versions			2
@entity26 said the cost for a sapphire screen could fall to $ 20 in the next few years , which might be affordable enough to make consumers give it a shot			1
another alternative would be ultrathin ( and less costly ) sapphire covers that would fit over glass screens for added durability			0
@entity88 , a @entity89 company , is developing a method to make synthetic sapphire sheets that are the width of a human hair			0
other companies in the @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 are working on similar technologies			0
" if costs can get low enough , these manufacturers may have a large market waiting for them , " @entity99 , senior editor of the @entity16 , wrote in the report			2
" but they 'll have to continue to contend with the incumbent technologies -- @entity49 and similar materials offered by other manufacturers			0

manufactured sapphire could be on screens for smartphones and tablets
@entity16 says the screens would be three times stronger than current displays
currently , a sapphire screen costs $ 30 to make , while @entity49 costs $ 3
@entity49 maker @entity50 says its product is moldable and getting stronger
