@entity0 -- the @entity3 government shut down at 12:01 a.m. et tuesday after lawmakers in the @entity5 and the @entity6 could not agree on a spending bill to fund the government			1
the two sides bickered and blamed each other for more than a week over @entity11 , the president 's signature health care law			1
@entity5 @entity13 insisted the spending bill include @entity16 amendments			1
@entity17 were just as insistent that it did n't			2
federal employees who are considered essential will continue working			2
but employees deemed non-essential -- close to 800,000 -- will be furloughed			2
most furloughed federal workers are supposed to be out of their offices within four hours of the start of business tuesday			1
president @entity24 issued a statement early tuesday to military members and @entity28 employees about the outcome of the shutdown			1
" those of you in uniform will remain on your normal duty status , " the president said			2
" @entity37 has passed , and i am signing into law , legislation to make sure you get your paychecks on time			1
and we 'll continue working to address any impact this shutdown has on you and your families			2
" " to all our @entity28 civiliansâ € ” i know the days ahead could mean more uncertainty , including possible furloughs , " the president added			1
" and i know this comes on top of the furloughs that many of you already endured this summer			1
you and your families deserve better than the dysfunction we 're seeing in @entity37			2
... that 's why i 'll keep working to get @entity37 to reopen our government and get you back to work as soon as possible			2
" the final hours the shutdown appeared inevitable monday night as @entity65 acknowledged they could n't overcome @entity6 objections to a proposal that includes provisions aimed at derailing @entity11			1
they planned to have another vote overnight that would request a conference with the @entity6 to work out their differences			1
but the move , which would not have averted a shutdown , was dismissed by senate majority leader @entity75			1
" we will not go to conference with a gun to our head , " @entity75 said			1
@entity81 rep. @entity80 said the reason there was n't a budget deal is because @entity13 refused to negotiate months ago			2
" they want to go to conference with 45 minutes left , " @entity80 said late monday night			1
" that is a recipe for a government shutdown			2
" @entity90 ping pong for the second time monday , the @entity6 rejected a @entity5 @entity13 effort to derail @entity11 by linking it to a proposal that would avert the shutdown			1
the @entity6 voted to table @entity5 amendments that would have delayed the individual mandate in the health care law and eliminated health insurance premium subsidies for members of @entity37 , their staffs and the president			1
in the latest volley of legislative ping pong over a short - term spending plan needed to avoid the shutdown , @entity65 were expected to meet to discuss their next steps			1
earlier , @entity17 had rejected a @entity5 proposal by a 54 - 46 vote , strictly along party lines			1
@entity24 made a previously unscheduled statement to reporters on monday afternoon , blasting the attempts by @entity65 to undermine @entity11 that he said threaten to harm the economy with a shutdown			1
" you do n't get to extract a ransom for doing your job , for doing what you 're supposed to be doing anyway , where just because there 's a law there that you do n't like , " the president said			2
@entity24 later called @entity123 and other party leaders in the @entity5 and @entity6 , the @entity5 said , but a @entity123 spokesman indicated there was no breakthrough			1
moderate @entity13 revolt against @entity123 ? @entity13 sources told @entity1 that moderate @entity65 were trying to galvanize what would amount to a rebellion against @entity123 and their tea party colleagues by defeating the latest proposed spending plan with attached @entity16 provisions			0
however , a procedural vote on the measure passed with only six @entity13 voting " no. " without congressional approval of new spending legislation , parts of the federal government will begin shutting down when the current fiscal year ends at midnight , forcing agencies to furlough thousands of workers and curtail some services until there is a resolution			2
" i feel sad about it			0
we expect more from our @entity37 , " said @entity150 , a worker for the @entity151 who said he faced being furloughed in a shutdown			0
polls show public opposition to a shutdown , and stocks ended lower monday on @entity158 due to concerns over the economic impact			0
the blame game @entity13 rep. @entity162 of @entity163 said on @entity1 's " @entity164 " that her party continues to be deeply concerned about tuesday 's scheduled opening of @entity11 health insurance exchanges and " keeping the checkbook out of @entity24 's hands and the damage can be done there			1
" get up to speed on the showdown rep. @entity174 , @entity175 , appearing alongside @entity162 , characterized the @entity13 strategy of tying overall government operations to at least a delay in health care changes as " irrational			0
" " it jeopardizes the economy and it makes no sense , " she said			0
weeks of hot potato last week , the @entity6 voted down a @entity5 @entity13 plan to eliminate funding for @entity11 in a short - term spending plan to keep the government running in the new fiscal year that begins tuesday			1
@entity17 have pressured @entity123 to give up a losing fight over @entity11 forced by tea party conservatives and instead hold a vote on a " clean " spending plan that includes no provisions seeking to undermine the health care reforms			1
@entity195 predicted that such a measure would pass easily with support from all @entity17 and more moderate @entity13			0
some @entity13 expressed frustration monday with the tactics of their congressional colleagues			0
veteran @entity13 sen. @entity201 of @entity202 noted that any attempt to repeal @entity11 would fail because of @entity24 's veto , which would require a two - thirds majority in the @entity6 to overcome			1
" there 's not 67 votes in the @entity6 , therefore , ergo , we 're not going to repeal @entity11 , " @entity201 said			1
" ok ? that 's it			0
we may do this for a day			0
we may do it for a week			0
we may do it for a month			0
it 's going to end up the same way			0
" @entity13 rep. @entity216 of @entity217 told @entity1 chief congressional correspondent @entity218 that whichever party was to blame , a shutdown will make everyone look bad			0
10 ways the shutdown would affect you @entity11 still a @entity13 focus @entity24 and @entity17 reject what they call @entity13 efforts to use the threat of a government shutdown to force negotiations on the president 's signature health care reforms			1
noting that the @entity234 has been upheld by the @entity235 , they say it is settled law that voters endorsed last year by re-electing @entity24 over @entity13 candidate @entity239 , who campaigned on repealing it			1
a new @entity1 / @entity242 poll shows that @entity3 are not happy about the prospect of a shutdown , which is happening because @entity37 has been unable to pass a budget for the new fiscal year that begins tuesday			2
a game of chicken between @entity81 , @entity13 according to the poll , 68 % of @entity3 think shutting down the government for even a few days is a bad idea , while 27 % think it 's a good idea			0
and it appears most @entity3 would blame congressional republicans for a shutdown : sixty - nine percent said they agreed with the statement that the party 's elected officials were acting like " spoiled children			0
" democrats , however , were n't far behind : fifty - eight percent of respondents said they too were acting like spoiled kids			0

" " you 've got an economy right now that 's very tied to government spending and government contracts , so that could have a ripple effect all across @entity288 , " she said on @entity1 's " @entity164			2
" if the government does shut down , it would be the first time it has happened in more than 17 years			2
that previous shutdown , sparked by a budget battle between @entity81 president @entity294 and a @entity37 , lasted for 21 days			0
@entity1 poll : @entity13 would bear the brunt of shutdown blame while the military will remain on duty , as will many essential public safety , health and welfare operations , many government offices will close			0
about a quarter of the federal government 's 3.3 million employees -- those frequently referred to as " nonessential " -- will be told to stay home from work until the shutdown is over			0
