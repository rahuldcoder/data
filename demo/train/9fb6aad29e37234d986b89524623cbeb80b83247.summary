what do you get when you combine a cryptocurrency , 752 left turns and a 16 - year - old @entity5 user ? for @entity8 driver @entity7 , it all adds up to sponsorship for one of the most exciting races of the year and a new bunch of tech - savvy fans			1
the story begins with a teenage racing fan from @entity16 , @entity17			0
@entity5 user @entity18 was watching some of the early races in the 2014 @entity8 season and noticed a black @entity21 with no sponsorship and a driver " racing the wheels off the car			1
" @entity18 was also a member of the subreddit / r / @entity8 and had seen the online community rally behind other drivers and the various fundraising and other campaigns they endorsed			2
the teenager wanted to get the no. 98 car sponsored at one of the fastest tracks on the circuit : the @entity37 in @entity38			1
@entity39 side - by - side on the 2.66 - mile track , sometimes reaching speeds of more than 200 mph			0
introduced in late 2013 and named for a silly internet meme , @entity44 is digital currency like @entity47 -- basically cash for the @entity45			2
money can be transferred nearly anywhere in the world for less than a penny per transaction and has been used prominently for charitable and notable causes			0
related : man selling home for $ 135,000 in @entity57 " i knew that @entity44 had done some significant fundraisers , like sending the @entity60 bobsled team to the @entity61 , " @entity18 said			1
" i was thinking what kind of response i would get if i did ask the ( @entity5 ) community about sponsoring a @entity8 car			1
they were all with it			0
" armed with support , @entity18 reached out to the owner of the no. 98 car , @entity71 , through @entity72			1
after exchanging telephone numbers , @entity18 told @entity74 about the plan to sponsor the car and how it was going to happen			2
" i asked if he knew about @entity5 or @entity44			1
he said no , " @entity18 said			0
" he told me the pricing of a full wrap and just a logo on the quarter panel			0
i do n't know if he thought i was pulling his leg			0
" @entity74 told @entity18 that a full wrap , meaning main sponsorship all over the car , would cost $ 50,000			2
@entity18 felt confident the / r / @entity8 community would get there with the help of @entity44			1
within a week , the community raised more than $ 55,000 , or 67 million @entity91 , to sponsor the car and put the @entity93 in the @entity95 race in may			1
@entity7 , who admits he had not been very active on the @entity45 , has been pumped up by the online support			2
" the more we 've walked through this ( fundraising effort ) , it has really been special to us , " @entity7 said			1
" people are noticing our effort			0
we 're a tiny little team with 7 or 8 employees			0
the amount of support we 're getting from the @entity5 community ... we 're just trying to do the best job we can			2
" for his part , @entity7 promoted the effort on @entity72 and also did an @entity5 ( @entity5 ) session on / r / dogecoin			1
he even claimed the @entity5 user name " dogedriver " to keep the momentum going			2
@entity112 , a board member at the @entity113 , said that raising the money for the sponsorship was done in record time			0
beyond sports ventures , @entity44 has raised money to build clean water wells in @entity119 and for a charity that trains service animals to work with children with autism and other disabilities			1
" we are all about fun and goofiness , " @entity112 said			0
" at the same time , we want to make sure that digital currency is really giving back to the world			0
we do feel like this is a technology that can make the world a better place , and we want to put that into practice by doing fundraisers			0
" @entity112 said the @entity8 sponsorship is one of the largest fundraisers they 've done to date			2
since the money was raised on the @entity45 , it was only fair that the color scheme of the car be chosen there as well			2
a poll posted on / r / dogecoin asked users to choose between gold , silver or black as the main color			0
@entity150 garnered more than 57 % of the vote , and the design was finalized			0
reddit users also helped develop the fire suits that will be worn by the team on race day			0
@entity7 said users asked him during his @entity5 what he wanted the design to look like			1
he told them just have fun with it			0
" i was n't going to hold them back on anything they wanted , " he said			0
" it actually a little more conservative than i probably expected -- something wild and off the wall , but they kept it pretty tame , actually			0
" the car and suits prominently feature the @entity173 dog face commonly associated with the " doge " internet meme , along with a rocket ship and the phrase " to the @entity177 , " commonly used for the popularity of @entity44			1
but @entity7 and @entity74 were n't done with @entity44 after just one race			1
the @entity8 all - star race at the @entity183 on may 17 pits the previous year 's race winners and two top qualifiers in a winner - take - all race			1
one driver voted in by the fans gets to participate as well			2
@entity7 and @entity74 said they would race the @entity44 car if @entity5 users vote @entity7 into the race			1
the @entity44 car is also likely to be made into a die - cast 1:24 scale car as part of a @entity8 deal with @entity197			1
fans of the @entity8 ' 14 video game will also get the chance to race the @entity44 car for themselves when it is added in an upcoming @entity202 pack			1
" as the company behind the @entity8 video games and mobile games , we love to see more technology - oriented partners getting involved in @entity8 , " said @entity203 , executive vice president of @entity204 , developer of the video game			1
" i think it will bring @entity8 to the attention of a lot of people that have n't been exposed before			2
" for @entity18 , who has loved @entity8 racing all his life , the video game might be the closest he gets to his dream			0
" i want to get into @entity8 and want to head to my local tracks like @entity219			0
i hopefully one day want to get into a real race car , " he said			0
for now , @entity18 will cheer on the @entity221 and @entity7 at @entity37 on may 4 .			1
