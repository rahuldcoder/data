@entity0 , @entity1 -- every year , i take at least one vacation out of the country to get my international travel fix			1
and this time , i 'm taking you with me			2
the travel bug is a forever - itch that leaves you longing to wake up in a foreign country , @entity8 says			1
this year , you can weigh in on where i go and what i do once i get there			2
we 're calling it : let 's ruin @entity8 's vacation ! by adding your comments below or sharing your ideas on @entity2 's @entity21 page , you can send me to either @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 or @entity25			1
the destination that gets the most positive response is where i 'll go			2
and to make it more fun , i wo n't even find out where i 'm heading until i actually get to the airport this sunday , august 30			2
there , i will tear open an envelope , read the results for the first time , and then head to my departure gate -- hopefully with at least a few articles of appropriate clothing			0
once i get to wherever it is you send me , i 'll be blogging on @entity2 and and checking in from time to time on @entity2			1
by sharing your ideas on @entity21 , you 'll be able to guide many aspects of this vacation			1
and i 'll cry myself to sleep at night wondering why i agreed to work on vacation and let other people plan it			1
i suppose , now , you might want a little background on why i 'd actually want to do this			0
i mean , besides the fact that clearly , i 'm a glutton for punishment			0
really , though , i think i just like a challenge			0
in the fall of 2003 , after an entire month of fruitlessly waiting by my phone to hear back about an entry - level position with @entity2 , i finally gave up hope and took my apparent job snub as some sort of cosmic sign from the @entity59			1
i decided , then , that the only reasonable course of action was to buy a plane ticket to @entity63 to spend the next three months running around with my backpack , trying -- again , quite fruitlessly -- to meet foreign chicks			0
though not quite a rucksack @entity67 , i did come back from these magical three months with a far greater ability to entertain myself in a completely new place among absolute strangers			0
( granted , for me , this can be accomplished by the presence of shiny objects			0
) amazingly , the day after i returned from @entity63 , @entity2 called and offered me the position			1
it took four long months , but the timing was remarkable and i could n't have been happier			0
but , as i started my new professional life , i was sick			0
i had the travel bug			1
now , this is not to be confused with bed bugs , which , fyi , i painfully fell victim to in @entity82 at a horrible , bomb - shelter - of - a - hostel they call @entity85 in @entity86			0
apparently , @entity86 smells like mildew and leaves you with a rash			0
no , this was the travel bug -- the forever - itch that leaves you longing to wake up in a foreign bed in a foreign country , rising to face new ideas and new people beneath an unfamiliar sky			1
of course , that 's just my poorly poetic way of saying : the world is huge and amazing			2
it 's so good ! once it hits your lips , it 's so good !			2
