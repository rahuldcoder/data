-- i am a 54 - year - old black woman -- a mother , lawyer and law professor			1
i teach at the @entity5 in @entity6 and live 12 miles away from @entity7 , @entity8			1
the median household income in my suburb is $ 85,000 per year			1
in @entity7 , it is $ 36,000			1
in my suburb , 3.5 % of the people are black			1
in @entity7 , almost 70 % are black			1
yet i share things in common with black people in @entity7 and , indeed , throughout the @entity16			1
when i shop , i 'm often either ignored as a waste of time or scrutinized as a potential shoplifter			0
in june , my daughter and i walked into the china and crystal department at a @entity23			1
i was about to speak to the salesperson directly in front of me			0
she walked right past me to welcome the white woman behind us			1
my daughter looked at me and said : " really ? did she just ignore us ? " my daughter is a young teenager at the crossroads of " skin color does n't matter " and " oh yes , it does			1
" she is in transition			0
i felt hurt , anger and embarrassment			0
but this kind of encounter happens routinely			0
driving , i tend to have a bit of a lead foot -- hitting 45 in a 35 mph zone			0
the few times i have been stopped in my suburb , the first question i 'm asked is whether i live " around here			1
" not one of my white friends has been asked that question when they were pulled over by a police officer			1
last summer , my teenage daughter was shopping with four white friends at a mall in an affluent @entity6 suburb			1
as they left the store , two mall security guards approached my daughter			2
they told her the store had called them and reported her as a shoplifter , and asked her to come with them			0
after a search , they found she had nothing			0
so far in her young life , mall security guards have stopped her on suspicion of shoplifting three times			1
each time she was innocent			0
i also have three sons			2
my two oldest are 22			0
they are 6 - foot - 5 and 6 - foot - 4 and each weighs more than 220 pounds			0
one recently graduated from college ; the other will graduate in 2015			0
all three like to wear jeans and the latest sneakers			0
these three young men have never been arrested or even been in a fight at school			1
every time my sons leave the house , i worry about their safety			2
one of my sons loves to go out at night to clubs			2
i worry about potential unrest at the clubs -- yes , black - on - black crime is a problem , and despite what many people think , black people complain about it all the time in their communities and churches and in newspapers and on radio stations			2
i also worry about his drive home and his being stopped by police			2
the data in @entity7 are an example of the larger picture in the @entity99 area			1
police stop , search and arrest black people at a disproportionate rate , even though they are less likely to possess contraband than white people			1
this son of mine who likes to go out at night is big and tall and he has brown skin			0
he graduated from college in may but can not find employment			0
he is an intelligent , clean - cut young man			2
but the negative stereotypes automatically assigned to his skin color follow him everywhere , even in job interviews , like extra weight			0
it reminds me of the airline employee who asks before you can check your suitcase : did a stranger ask you to carry something or pack your bag ? in my son 's case , the answer is yes			0
he is carrying extra weight , unfairly , and without his knowledge or consent , packed in his luggage			0
a few years ago my husband and i went on a cruise			0
my older boys were teenagers at the time and were taking summer enrichment classes at a school about a mile from our home			2
they planned to walk to school in the morning			2
at the top of a long list of things to do before we left for our trip was " e-mail chief of police			2
" i explained to the chief that my husband and i were going on a cruise , i was a member of the community and that my two sons would be walking to school			1
i attached pictures of the boys , explaining that only a couple of black families lived in the neighborhood			2
my sons did not normally walk in the neighborhood , so they would draw attention			2
i offered to bring my sons to the police department so officers could meet them			1
the police chief and i met and all went well			0
but i 've asked myself : how many parents of white sons have thought to add to their to - do - before - leaving - town list , " write letter to local police department , introducing sons and attaching photos , so police do not become suspicious and harass them " ? even though my older boys are men , i still worry about them			1
i worry about my 13 - year - old			0
this worry is a stressful , and sadly normal , part of my daily existence			0
my youngest will be 6 feet tall in the coming weeks			0
these young black men have arrows pointed and ready to shoot at them daily -- black - on - black crime , police encounters , societal bias and mistrust			1
shortly after the @entity181 shooting , i met with a group of my 13 - year - old 's black male friends to explain to them what happened in @entity7 , and what to do and how to respond if they are ever stopped by the police			1
my words reminded me of stories and fears my grandfather used to share with me about his encounters with police during the @entity195 era			0
these are just a few of the many ways in which people in @entity16 are treated differently based on the color of their skin			1
this has been going on for a long time			0
i hope the events in @entity7 will encourage people to see the stark differences in the experiences of black people -- not just black people who struggle economically but also black people like me -- and white people as they go about their routine , daily lives .			1

@entity214 , a black woman and lawyer , lives in a suburb 12 miles from @entity7
she has been ignored or seen as shoplifting risk in stores , as has her young daughter
she notified police when her sons were walking to school so they would n't harass them
@entity228 hopes @entity7 will start *conversation* on black @entity16 ' daily experiences
