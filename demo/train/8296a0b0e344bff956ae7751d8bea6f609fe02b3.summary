@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 's senior commander in effect ordered his soldiers wednesday not to commit suicide , a plea that came after 11 suicides since january 1 , two of them in the past week			1
an @entity12 honor guard stands ready to fire a salute at @entity0			1
" if you do n't remember anything else i say in the next five or 10 minutes , remember this -- suicidal behavior in the 101st on @entity0 is bad , " brig			1
gen. @entity19 told his forces			1
" it 's bad for soldiers , it 's bad for families , bad for your units , bad for this division and our army and our country and it 's got to stop now			1
suicides on @entity0 have to stop now			2
" @entity0 's suicide rate , the highest in the @entity12 , " is not a good statistic , " he said in remarks to one of four divisions he addressed during the day			1
after nearly one soldier per week committed suicide at the post between january and mid-march , the @entity12 instituted a suicide prevention program that " seemed to be having good effects " until last week , when two more suicides occurred , he said			1
" suicide is a permanent solution to what is only a temporary problem , " @entity19 said			1
" @entity4 do n't quit			2
no matter how bad your problem seems today , trust me , it 's not the end of the world			1
it will be better tomorrow			0
do n't take away your tomorrow			0
" he urged anyone feeling hopeless or suicidal to " tell somebody			0
" " you would n't hesitate to seek medical attention for a physical injury or wound ; do n't hesitate to seek medical attention for a psychological injury			1
" @entity19 exhorted any soldier who suspects that a fellow soldier may be feeling suicidal to act -- first by asking how the soldier feels , then by escorting him or her to help			2
" do not wait , " he said			0
soldiers can turn to their leaders , chaplains , medics , social workers , teammates , family and friends , he said			0
" do n't let yourself , your buddies or your families down , " he said , ending his comments by repeating , " this has got to stop , soldiers			1
it 's got to stop now			0
" but @entity19 's message -- called a @entity84 event -- is likely to be ineffective , said dr. @entity85 , a professor of community health at @entity87 in @entity88 , who has researched veterans ' suicide and served last year on a @entity92 blue - ribbon panel on suicide risk			1
" it sounds like an order , " he told @entity2 in a telephone interview			0
" i 'm not sure that a command like this is going to alter the course of somebody who is on a trajectory of self - harm			0
" he suggested the @entity12 might want to adopt the @entity103 @entity92 model			2
" they 're dealing with a comparable problem with a similar population , " @entity105 said			0
" they have infused more sensitivity to their approach to suicide prevention as opposed to this			0
this is like any other order			0
" the military culture attaches a stigma to mental illness that needs to be reduced , he said			0
soldiers who acknowledge they are considering suicide can suffer severe repercussions , such as losing opportunities for promotion and access to firearms , he said			2
if the @entity12 is serious about addressing the problem , it needs to address the stressors common to soldiers , including financial problems , marital problems , frequency of deployments , length of deployments , deployments to hostile environments , exposure to extreme stress and service - related injuries , he said			1
the role of alcohol too must be addressed if the rate of suicide is to be lowered , he said			2
" more often than not , these are individuals who 'll get liquored up , so to speak , and have access to a gun and die from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , " @entity105 said			0
@entity150 , who serves on the board of the @entity152 for @entity153 , the advisory council of the @entity154 at @entity155 , and on the advisory board of @entity157 , was equally unimpressed with @entity19 's tack			1
" it 's the equivalent of ' @entity160 ' to prevent drug abuse , ' " he told @entity2 in a telephone interview			0
screening techniques that involve a series of questions are available to identify people at risk for suicide , he said			0
" prominent among them , if not the most important question is : have you made a plan for suicide ? using a simple battery of questions , you can suss out people who might be at risk , which is far more important than telling somebody , ' do n't take your life , ' " @entity150 said			2
the problem is not limited to @entity0			1
the @entity12 has reported 64 potential active - duty suicides this year ; 35 have been confirmed as suicides , and 29 are pending determination of manner of death			2
