-- @entity2 's face is a picture of concentration as she crouches over the table tennis table , batting ball after ball back to her opponent			1
as she rocks back and forth , executing every flick , chip and smash with lightning speed , it 's easy to see why she says the game calls for a nimble mind as well as quick hands and feet			2
" table tennis is often compared to a 100m run while playing chess , " @entity2 told @entity0 's human to @entity18			1
" it 's really right			2
you have to think as well as move -- so not only does your energy get used up , but also your brain gets exhausted			2
" despite being only 26 years old , @entity2 is a veteran of the sport honing her game over the course of 16 years in the professional ranks and before that as a precocious amateur			1
the girl affectionately known as " @entity2 " ( her first name means " love " in @entity36 ) shot to fame in her native @entity38 following a series of appearances on national television when she was a toddler			1
" i started table tennis at three years and nine months old and i 've been covered by the media since i was four , " she explains			1
tv viewers marveled at the little girl from @entity46 who could barely see over the top of the table but could hold her own against adult opponents			1
but it was her tears when she lost a points that most people remember , earning her the nickname " cry baby			2
" some of the footage , which can be found on @entity57 , looks traumatic at times , but she recalls her early duels against tv opponents with a sense of fondness now			0
" i was just putting my whole energy against them , " she says			0
" i was just enjoying surprising people			0
i wanted to win the game			0
i was happy that people cheered for me			0
" the performances helped lodge @entity2 's name in the public consciousness and set the tone for a life devoted to table tennis			1
today , @entity2 trains for around six to seven hours every day and estimates to have completed more than 25,000 hours ( nearly three years solid ) of practice to date			1
this work ethic , instilled by her mother , @entity76 , laid the foundations for her rapid rise through the junior ranks			0
at five years old , she won her first national competition and turned pro at the age of 10 in 1999			0
four years later , she was representing her country at the world championships in @entity85 where she reached the quarterfinals , before making history at the @entity88 in @entity89 when , aged 15 years , 287 days , she became the youngest - ever female table tennis player to appear at the @entity91			1
a medal proved elusive at both @entity89 and @entity93 four years later where she was afforded the honor of flag bearer for the @entity38 team			1
but a silver medal in the team event in @entity99 in 2012 earned her and @entity38 their first - ever medal in table tennis since it became an @entity104 sport in 1988			1
" everyone was so happy ( back at home )			0
i was amazed how pleased they were			0
" i was happy to win the medal but i felt even happier to show my medal to the people , and people living in the disaster zone , " she says referring to her hometown of @entity46 , which was devastated by a tsunami in march 2011			0
there have been other triumphs at the table , notably five world championship bronze medals ( four team and one mixed doubles ) , an individual bronze at the 2005 @entity123 and a much coveted national title in 2012			2
finally winning her national championships was one of her proudest achievements			0
" i finally won at my 13th try -- the competition was hard for me mentally ( because ) i could n't win it for such a long time			0
" @entity2 has also made an impact off the table , helping to popularize the game in her homeland while also cultivating an avid following in @entity136 by competing in the country 's @entity137			1
she also speaks fluent @entity139 and was given an unofficial rubber stamp of approval when she played a few rallies against then @entity136 president @entity143 during an official trip to @entity38 in 2008			1
today , her popularity in @entity136 remains strong and so does the rivalry against the sport 's strongest nation			1
" right now , the biggest goal is to beat @entity136 , " she says			1
it 's likely she will have to defeat them if she is to fulfill her childhood ambitions and claim gold at the @entity154 in just under two years ' time			2
" i want to be on the podium in both team and individual events there			0
i ca n't forget the view from the podium in @entity99 -- i feel so proud to see the @entity38 flag being raised at ( medal ) ceremonies			2
" @entity2 has defied the simplistic classifications that are frequently applied to child prodigies -- she has n't become an all - conquering hero , yet , nor has she gone off the rails			1
instead , she has trodden a middle ground , retaining a sense of perspective and satisfaction despite having done much of her growing up in public			0
" i 'm very proud that i 've been able to continue playing table tennis for such a long time , " she said			1
" i can play thanks to the support of a lot of people			0
and what makes me happy is to see those people 's delighted faces and share a joy of victory with them			2
" " seeing happy people gives me the most energy			0
" she just wishes more people would take up the game			0
