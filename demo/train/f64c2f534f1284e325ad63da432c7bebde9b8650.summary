-- @entity4 , if you 're reading this , for goodness sake return this woman 's calls			1
ask your assistants if there 's a box of yellowing fax messages lying around somewhere in @entity11 -- she sent you one daily for a while			0
track down the ton of letters asking -- pleading -- for your help starting a @entity18 - style talk show in @entity19			1
because this is n't just another eager fan			0
her name is @entity23 , and in the last eight years she 's done it -- and then some			1
with no tv experience whatsoever , @entity23 has become the " @entity30 " -- it 's impossible not to read an interview with the glamorous 49 - year - old without the moniker cropping up			1
breezing into @entity0 's @entity38 studios , electric blue dress clinging to her slim figure , glossy pink eye shadow and lipstick to match , @entity23 is in her element , the sound bites coming thick and fast			1
and why would n't the mother - of - two be comfortable in front of the camera ? this is the face of " moments with @entity46 , " the hugely successful talk show @entity23 founded in 2006 , attracting such high profile guests as @entity48 and @entity50 chief @entity49			1
the manicured @entity46 and her guests lounge in plush apartments , chat over coffee , contemplate tasteful visual cues			0
@entity19 's first syndicated talk show was so slick that people initially questioned whether it could actually have been created in @entity57			1
@entity23 assured them it was			1
there was more to come			0
nine months ago she started @entity61 -- @entity19 's first global black entertainment network			2
@entity4 who ? " when i started my journey into television , there was nothing that i did n't try , to reach this woman , " says @entity23 about her early attempts to contact ms @entity18			1
" we sat for days on end , would send daily faxes , would send weekly faxes			0
at some point , when we did n't get a response , we realized that @entity4 was n't going to save us , she was n't there to help us to get this talk show of @entity19 started			1
and then i just basically got out there and said ' let 's just do the very best that we can			0
' " @entity46 's big moment winfrey or not , in less than a decade @entity23 has built a tv network creating 1,000 hours of programming yearly			2
and there are plans to make even more channels -- all under the @entity61 banner			0
but what makes @entity23 's story remarkable is not that she conquered @entity19 tv -- but that she did it without any prior media experience			1
" i went on a training course for learning how to present , went back and said : ' here i am and i want to produce my own talk show ! ' " said the @entity93 - born entrepreneur in an interview with @entity0 's @entity95			1
" of course , there were many knock backs along the way , many people telling me ' you ca n't do these things			0
' but i think what 's important in life is that you believe in yourself and the things you can do			0
" before she was the queen of @entity19 chat shows , @entity23 was a head of human resources at oil giant @entity110 for a decade			1
then there 's the consultancy firm she set up , the executive - training center she developed , and the charity she founded			0
the ' other ' @entity19 so where did this drive to be on tv come from ? @entity23 puts it down to a " deep - seated passion to tell @entity19 's story			1
" even if that meant standing in the middle of @entity38 with a microphone			0
" a couple of years ago i stood there with a microphone , and just randomly stopped people in the street , " explained @entity23			2
" i said : ' when you hear the word @entity19 , what comes to mind ? ' " " i heard ' starving children , poverty , @entity133 , @entity134			2
' i heard ' babies with flies on their faces			0
' and my next question was : ' why do you think this of @entity19 ? ' and the response was : ' it 's what i read in the newspapers , it 's what i see on television			2
' because that 's the popular notion of @entity19			2
" not if @entity23 has anything to do with it			2
her show celebrates a very different continent , one brimming with entrepreneurs , academics , and artists , all taking their place on her coveted couch			2
" it 's glossy , it 's got razzmatazz , " she says about her network 's distinctive style			0
" it shows that there 's a new generation of @entity19 out there that want this content they can identify with , that speaks to them			2
" dream big born in @entity38 , @entity23 spent her early years between the @entity93 and @entity19			1
on holidays she would visit her grandparents ' cocoa farm , and remembers them spreading out beans to dry in the @entity57 sun. growing up in 1960s @entity93 was tough for one of only three black children in her school			1
she was asked questions like : " do you guys live in tress ? do you dance around fires ? what do you eat for breakfast ? " when she was 11 years old , @entity23 's father died , and her 73 - year - old mother still remains a huge source of strength and inspiration			1
" she is very prayerful woman			0
i am very prayerful woman			0
so i find that through working hard and praying hard a lot of things just get done , " she said			0
it seems the ' @entity30 ' does n't need ms @entity18 after all			0
watch : from orphan to billionaire @entity194 ' @entity193 ' inspire : @entity196 says gender equality is a myth @entity0 's @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
