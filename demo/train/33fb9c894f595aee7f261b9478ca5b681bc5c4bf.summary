@entity0 , @entity1 -- given all their country and people have been through , between political upheavals , human rights abuses , hurricanes , abject poverty and last week 's earthquake , " if @entity4 were constantly questioning their faith , they would all be atheists			1
" these words came from the rev. @entity15 as he prepared to lead @entity4 mass sunday at @entity17 in @entity0 , @entity1			2
some of the 100 @entity4 parishioners who gathered raised their hands to the heavens in praise , grateful their loved ones had been found			2
others bowed their heads and clenched their hands for those lost , still missing and all who suffered			0
one woman wept out of guilt because she -- a @entity30 citizen -- had been able to leave her devastated homeland a day after the quake , while so many were left behind			0
their unshaken faith and devotion to @entity36 is the same sort that 's played out in other houses of worship , in living rooms and on the torn - up streets of @entity4			1
are you in @entity4 and safe ? share your story , photos with @entity45 @entity46 of @entity47 , @entity48 , said her mother clung to her @entity50 for days , reading psalms over and over again , as they waited for word on the whereabouts and condition of @entity46 's sister and other relatives			1
when her sister , who was in @entity4 on a missionary trip with their @entity61 , called late thursday , @entity46 said , " i went straight to church and prayed and prayed and prayed			2
we continue to pray for those who are lost and still in need			0
" on the streets of @entity68 , with many of their churches crumbled , people have gathered to worship and sing @entity72 and @entity74 hymns			1
" that 's the soundscape of the country right now , " said @entity75 , a professor of religion and anthropologist of @entity4 who teaches at @entity79 in @entity80			1
" it 's the business of religion to create meaning out of chaos			0
... tragically , the business of religion is getting a lot of trade today			0
" see complete coverage of @entity4 earthquake it 's often said that 80 percent of @entity4 are @entity72 , although other estimates range from 55 percent to 85 percent			1
@entity75 , who puts her best estimate at 70 percent , said getting a proper census in @entity4 to nail down numbers is impossible			2
but between protestant denominations and @entity72 , it is without doubt a majority @entity100 country , she said			0
weaved in , however , are the nuances that come with the country 's troubled history			2
colonized by the @entity107 , the land then known as @entity106 emerged as one of the wealthiest colonies of the 18th century			0
it 's flourishing sugar production and aggressive deforestation was achieved on the backs of half a million african slaves			0
they brought with them their own belief systems , rooted in @entity118 and @entity120 traditions			0
@entity121 , often misunderstood and branded with stereotypes , has its own ceremonies and rituals meant to honor spirits , or loas			1
these spirits , seen as intermediaries with @entity36 and links to ancestors , can be called upon for help			2
and for practicing @entity132 , especially @entity133 who can view saints as they would spirits , the two systems do not have to be mutually exclusive			0
not everyone is necessarily practicing @entity138 , commonly anglicized as @entity138 , but @entity75 said the @entity140 @entity4 traditions are usually kept alive and the ancestral spirits are inherited by at least one member of every family			2
@entity4 - born @entity144 remembered being hurt as a boy by the words of @entity100 missionaries who misunderstood and demonized his peoples ' traditions			1
theirs were sentiments much like those uttered last week by televangelist @entity153 who said the @entity4 people are " cursed " because they " swore a pact with the devil " to get out from under @entity107 rule			1
@entity153 's comments were " insensitive , theologically unsound and loaded with racial connotations , " said @entity144 , a professor of religion and international studies at @entity162 in @entity80			1
in the @entity0 church sunday , the priest reminded his congregants that theirs is an all - loving @entity36 , not a vindictive one			1
their @entity36 , he said , is in the international outpouring of support from people who , one week ago , did n't know where @entity4 was			1
their @entity36 is a rock of stability when the earth trembles			2
their @entity36 is the one who lifts them up " to mend our broken bones , to brush us off and to bury the dead , " @entity15 said			0
and during this first @entity180 after the earthquake , their @entity36 was in the music that moved them			0
to the distinctly @entity186 sounds of their band and choir , they sang hymns of praise to the one they believe stands with them			0
" people continue to be @entity36 's instruments , " the pastor said , with the help of a @entity197 translator			1
" @entity36 will work through all of us to bring new life to @entity4			1
" as he spoke , a little girl , too young to understand the pain around her , did what she could			0
she planted kisses on the forehead of her anguished father , his face buried in his hands , before skipping off to make fish faces and giggle with other children .			0

@entity4 would be atheists if they questioned faith , given all they *'ve* seen , priest says
instead belief in @entity36 remains unshaken , as seen in churches , homes and on streets
@entity121 , often misunderstood , is part of people 's rich history
their @entity36 is all - loving , not vindictive , priest says in answer to @entity153
