-- in 1999 , i moved with my wife and 8 - month - old daughter from @entity4 to @entity5			2
i 'd been given an apartment to live in and a small stipend to survive on , compliments of the @entity9 , which has been bringing foreign artists to the city since 1961			2
among the things i 'd packed in my large suitcase was the unfinished manuscript of " @entity16			2
" the fellowship had come at a fortunate time			2
our landlord , a mean old man who owned the brownstone we lived in ( hi there , @entity24 , still living alone ? ) was kicking us out for the offense of having a kid			2
we had nowhere else to go and little money in the bank			2
my book , which i 'd been working on for a number of years already , was far from finished , and the more i tried to put on an appearance of painstaking , @entity35 calm , the more my inner self began to betray me			2
the shakes i had at my desk could not be entirely blamed on the massive amounts of caffeine i was imbibing			2
moving to @entity5 solved all these problems			0
we had a nice two - bedroom apartment in the sleepy neighborhood of @entity43			0
my wife and i slept in one bedroom , i worked in the other , and we converted the surprisingly spacious broom closet into a nursery for our daughter			0
@entity49 , it turned out , had lived in @entity43 during the 1920s			0
a building one block from us had a historical marker indicating that @entity55 had rented an apartment there , too			1
@entity0 : 7 gifts from the universe that everybody gets when you 're writing a book , not going outside much during the day , time tends to blur			0
though i liked @entity5 and enjoyed the anonymity of living in a foreign city where nobody cared if i ever finished my book or not , my reprieve from literary anxiety was only temporary			1
at some point during our first or second year in @entity5 , the physical symptoms i 'd been suffering back in @entity72 — a constriction in my chest , as though a corset were being tightened over my ribcage — returned			0
more than usual , i mean			0
sometimes when we were out bike riding , or pushing our daughter 's stroller through the aisles of @entity84 , the big department store in @entity5 , hoping she 'd fall asleep so we could eat , i became paranoid that we 'd left the gas stove on at home			1
fearing that my computer and manuscript would go up in the blaze , i made us race home , unjustifiably furious with my wife the entire way , only to find the burner off and the apartment intact			0
shut up in my office all day , coming out to stand on the balcony and stare moodily down at the wet leaves on the pavement , at night either self - absorbed and silent or trying to loosen myself up with multiple glasses of @entity101 beer — that 's what i was like at the time			1
that 's what i was like to live with			1
and then , one night , i had a dream			0
i know dreams are boring , but bear with me			1
plus , it 's short			1
all that happened in the dream was that an owl , descended out of nowhere , seized me in its talons and blew into my mouth a single breath tasting of blood			1
the dream lasted no more than four or five seconds			0
but it was one of those dreams that seems somehow more real than a typical dream , as if it were playing out at a level just below my conscious mind , or as if it originated not from my mind at all but from a source outside of me			1
the owl , by the way , was gigantic			1
in fact , the bird was stylized in the manner of a @entity135 , with lozenges of color running up and down its wings and over its breast , and a large helmeted ceremonial head			0
its eyes were fierce , omnipotent , bright yellow			0
it fixed these eyes on mine			0
when the owl lowered its beak to my lips , i opened my mouth			1
and then the owl exhaled one long forceful breath			1
with a whooshing sound , my lungs inflated			0
this inspiration had a taste : the mineral , meaty flavor of a predatory diet			0
i awoke from this dream feeling that a message had been delivered to me			0
the great owl in the @entity165 had taken a personal interest in me and my book			1
the owl had come to give me the power to write it			1
@entity0 : page - turners you 'll tear through did i believe this ? in my half - awake state , i did			0
the dream put me in such a good mood that i did n't want to debunk it , even as i came to full alertness			0
at breakfast , i described it to my wife in detail			0
later that same morning , when my @entity101 publisher arrived to take us to a local flea market , i described the dream to him			0
as we walked to the flea market , the sun was shining			0
i was nattering on my about my dream , saying that it was " prophetic			0
" my publisher responded , " well , i hope you are right about this dream because it would be very good , @entity193 , if you finished your book soon			1
" by this time we were entering the flea market			0
i looked up at the first table we came to and stopped in my tracks			0
@entity198 on the table were a few hundred owl figurines			1
there were wooden owls , metal owls , owls carved from stone and jade , owls made of colored glass , owl bookends , owl ashtrays and owl lamp stands			1
the @entity101 guy who ran the stand must have thought it was his lucky day			0
here was this @entity214 , who did n't even know the @entity101 world for owl , suddenly buying up much of his stock			1
i got about 15 different owls that morning			1
ever since that day , with increasing discrimination , i 've hunted for owl - themed merchandise at any secondhand store i happen into			1
for christmases and birthdays , my wife and daughter invariably give me something owl - related			1
i have owl cuff links , an owl tiepin and a wonderfully informative book by @entity231 titled , simply , @entity232			1
from the shelves of the room i 'm writing this in , these owls stare down at me			1
i keep them around to remind myself of the dream			0
of course , there 's a perfectly rational explanation for all of this			1
i was in the middle of writing a long and difficult book when i had my dream			0
my unconscious , processing the anxiety of my waking life , sent me the owl as a kind of psychic @entity249			1
the owl is sacred to @entity251 , goddess of wisdom			1
traditionally , the owl represents vigilance , knowledge and sagacity			1
@entity231 tells us that , for the ancient @entity261 , the appearance of an owl was a good omen			1
@entity0 : why the best way to get creative is to make some rules likewise , my happening upon all those flea - market owls is n't that remarkable			1
as i 've since learned from my collecting habit , there are always owl figurines for sale at flea markets			1
i 'd just never noticed them before			0
that 's how coincidence works : the signs from @entity277 people are always claiming to find are really a function of their own brain 's selecting , from the myriad objects in the world , those that cohere to the story they 're telling themselves			1
but explain this to me			0
we now jump forward 10 years			0
i 'm living in @entity290 , @entity291 , writing the last chapters of my recent novel " @entity293			0
" it 's winter , and my editor has given me until the end of the year to hand the book in			1
working day and night , i soon reach a state of anxiety at least as great as the one i suffered in @entity5			1
in this predicament , lying in bed late one night , sleepless with worry , i hear what sounds like an owl outside my bedroom window			1
of course i think i 'm imagining it			0
it 's probably some other kind of bird , or not a bird at all			1
but the next night , it returns			0
next , a few days after that			0
finally , i go on @entity315 , type " hooting owls " and am rewarded with a video of an owl that sounds exactly like the one i 'm listening to in the darkness			1
and it 's right outside my bedroom window			2
@entity0 : the best new books of october 2012 for two straight months , as i finished " @entity293 , " the owl visited me			2
as soon as i handed in the book , the owl vanished , so far for good			2
did i believe @entity251 sent it ? no. still , it was n't a dream owl this time but a living one , and lying in bed at night , listening to its cry in the frigid air , i could n't help feeling encouraged , feeling that the owl was on my side			2
in the end , whether my owls came from my unconscious , at the prompting of the universe , or due to a migratory pattern does n't matter			2
what matters is that the experience — both of my dream owl and the living one outside my window — arrived at the point i needed it , and helped me persevere			1
in the midst of my skeptical , cynical , often pessimistic nature exists a slender capacity to believe , if only temporarily , in a guiding , unseen power , and whenever this happens , i go with it			0
that 's what inspiration is			2
you do n't get it from the gods			0
the owl at my window was just a bird , after all , trying to get through the winter			2
the owl in my dream was my own creation			2
it was me , breathing into myself , in order to breathe out again in a flow of words			0

one writer 's experience with dreams and totem *animals* cures his anxiety
@entity193 just happened to be *buoyed* by owl imagery during writer 's block
ultimately , whether or not the owls were *divine* *messengers* , @entity193 found them inspiring
