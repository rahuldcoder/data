-- on the evening of @entity3 's death , renowned recording artist @entity1 told the audience of @entity7 ' @entity6 party , " first it was @entity9 , then it was @entity11 , and now , the magnificent @entity3			1
i 'd like to have every gentleman and lady in this room commit themselves to get our government to legalize drugs -- so they 'll have to get it through a doctor , not to some gangsters who just sell it under the table			0
" @entity1 's idiotic comments were followed closely by the often original , but in this case mistaken , @entity28			1
on monday morning 's edition of " @entity0 starting point with @entity31 , " she agreed with @entity1 : " the point i think is absolutely fair -- that the war on drugs has failed , and we are not acknowledging it			1
we are spending over $ 50 billion a year fighting a war that has become a war on our own people			0
" first , we do not know the immediate cause of @entity3 's death			1
but we do know that she had a long and public struggle with drugs , both legal and illegal			1
but legalizing drugs and making them more readily available would not have saved her life , or the life of @entity9 , or the thousands of other drug - related deaths each year			1
lest @entity1 forget , @entity9 died from acute propofol intoxication administered to him by a doctor			1
@entity11 died from alcohol poisoning -- a legal , easily available substance			2
a fatal combination of painkillers , sleeping pills and anti-depressants -- all legal prescription drugs -- killed @entity60			2
@entity61 died from multiple drug intoxications ( only prescription and over-the - counter medications according to the medical exam ) combined with pneumonia			2
and @entity67 overdosed on prescription and over-the - counter drugs			0
all these drugs are legal and prescribed by doctors			1
contrary to what @entity1 and other legalizers would like to think , legalization does not prevent the abuse and misuse of drugs			1
in fact , it accelerates it			0
according to the @entity82 , prescription drug abuse is the nation 's fastest - growing drug problem			1
in 2007 , there were 28,000 deaths from prescription drug overdoses			0
this is five times higher than the number in 1990			0
more people die in @entity91 every year from prescription drug abuse ( i.e. , legal and available drugs ) than from heroin and cocaine combined			1
the @entity96 reported that the number of deaths from prescription narcotics increased fourfold over the past 10 years			0
this coincided with a fourfold increase in the number of prescriptions written for powerful painkillers			0
legalization increases supply and when you increase supply , you increase the use and misuse of deadly drugs			2
as for @entity1 's envy of @entity114 , he should realize that its legalization experiment has backfired			1
with the legalization of marijuana came an increase in drug addictions and dependency followed by illegal drug trafficking , human trafficking and crime			2
after a rapid influx of organized crime , the @entity125 has announced that it will ban foreigners from the country 's pot shops starting in 2013			0
drug decriminalization in @entity132 has also been a failure			0
as of 2007 , @entity132 was still the country with the most cases of injected drug related @entity137 , and it was the only @entity139 country to show a significant increase in homicides from 2001 to 2006			0
" with 219 deaths by drug ' overdose ' a year , @entity132 has one of the worst records , reporting more than one death every two days			2
along with @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , @entity132 is one of the countries that recorded an increase in drug overdose by over 30 % in 2005 , " according to the @entity154			0
@entity1 and @entity28 's misguided solutions would result in more tragic deaths like @entity3 's			1
illicit drugs are not harmful because they are illegal , they are illegal precisely because they are harmful			0
it is my hope that in the national dialogue surrounding @entity3 's death , our country 's loudest voices would speak honestly and seriously about the drug problems in @entity91			1
in the 1980s and ' 90s , the @entity91 beat back the cocaine and heroine epidemics , not by legalization or decriminalization , but by tough law enforcement , strong prevention and education programs and public outcry			2
you could hardly watch tv without seeing the @entity178 's famous " this is your brain on drugs " advertisements			2
if we are to be successful today , we must reignite that same national effort			0
@entity3 's mother , @entity183 , understood the seriousness of drug abuse			1
in a 2009 interview with @entity187 , @entity3 recalled how her mother showed up one day at her doorstep with sheriff 's officers and a court order in a drug intervention			1
" ( my mother ) says , ' i have a court ( injunction ) here , ' " @entity3 said			0
" either you do it my way , or we 're just not going to do this at all			0
we are both going to go on tv , and you 're going to retire			0
' " if more @entity91 , celebrities in particular , spoke and acted like @entity183 , rather than like @entity1 or @entity28 , fewer @entity91 would be victims to drug addiction			1
follow @entity204 on @entity205 join the conversation on @entity207 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0

@entity3 had a long and public struggle with drugs , but cause of her death is *unknown*
@entity210 : some have said legalizing drugs would have saved @entity3 's life
numerous celebrities have died from using drugs that are legal and prescribed by doctors
@entity1 : legalization does not prevent the abuse and misuse of drug ; it accelerates it
