they were part of an elite squad confronting wildfires on the front line , setting up barriers to stop the spreading destruction			0
but in their unpredictable world , it does n't take much to turn a situation deadly			0
in this case , a wind shift and other factors caused a central @entity15 fire , which now spans 8,400 acres , to become erratic , said @entity16 , @entity17 spokesman			1
though the deaths are under investigation , the inferno appears to have proved too much , even for the shelters the 19 firefighters carried as a last - ditch survival tool			1
" the fuels were very dry , the relative humidity was low , the wind was coming out of the south			0
it turned around on us because of monsoon action , " @entity16 told @entity29 affiliate @entity28			0
" that 's what caused the deaths			0
the firefighters -- members of the @entity37 's @entity36 -- were killed sunday while fighting the @entity38 , northwest of @entity39			1
among the dead was @entity41 , the unit 's 43 - year - old superintendent			1
honoring the fallen also killed , according to the city of @entity44 : @entity45 , 29 ; @entity46 , 23 ; @entity47 , 31 ; @entity48 , 24 ; @entity49 , 30 ; @entity50 , 21 ; @entity51 , 26 ; @entity52 , 28 ; @entity53 , 22 ; @entity54 , 24 ; @entity55 , 23 ; @entity56 , 36 ; @entity57 , 32 ; @entity58 , 27 ; @entity59 , 25 ; @entity60 , 28 ; @entity61 , 21 ; and @entity62 , 27			1
the deaths of the 19 -- representing about 20 percent of @entity44 's fire department -- devastated the city			1
@entity44 fire chief @entity66 , who sent the unit at the request of regional authorities , said he was told that one of the firefighters had radioed they were about to deploy their fire shelters , a sort of aluminum blanket that protects against the flames and heat -- and a measure of last resort			1
all he could do was wait			0
" we just lost 19 of some of the finest people you 'll ever meet			1
right now , we 're in crisis , " @entity66 told reporters			0
a 20th member of the unit was working on an assignment away from his team and survived , @entity66 said			1
" he feels terribly , and we all feel terribly			0
unfortunately , we have very few words to express that kind of sorrow , but we understood each other			1
when you take a person in your arms and you hug them , you do n't have to say too much , " he said			0
a tribute to the firefighters grew monday outside @entity101			1
flowers , @entity104 flags and signs -- including those reading " 19 great guys gone -- you will be missed " and " @entity44 19 forever in our hearts " -- were placed on or near a fence that separated the station from a road			1
the tokens also included 19 bottles of water , arranged in a circle			2
also left was a copy of @entity117 , which contains the lines , " and if , according to my fate , i am to lose my life / please bless with your protecting hand my children and my wife			0
" gov. @entity125 called the loss " unbearable " during a monday news conference and said she understood the pain people are dealing with			2
" for now , we mourn , " she said			0
the wildfire , which is considered the deadliest in state history , began friday near @entity132 , apparently because of lightning strikes , according to @entity135 's office and other authorities			1
the fire was n't contained at all on monday morning , and about 200 homes and other structures have burned in the area of @entity132 , a community of about 600 people , the state forestry division said			2
about 400 ground personnel and 100 incident - management staff were working to control the fire monday			1
there are no other reported injuries from the blaze , @entity16 said			2
" as we face the day the highest priority is for the fallen comrades , " said @entity150 , an incident commander with the state forestry division			0
" we got a lot of hotshot crews in the nation , and they are the elite of the ground firefighters			1
they 're highly trained and highly specialized			0
they are a younger generation			0
that 's the tragedy of it , that lives would be lost of such a young group			0
" he added of the fire , " we know that there are values to be protected and efforts that need to be ongoing in this fire			2
it 's a long ways from being over			0
" firefighters will work on the eastern side of the fire in an effort to protect homes in evacuated areas , as air tankers drop fire retardant on the perimeter and five helicopters douse hot spots with water			1
@entity188 of thick black smoke covered the sky as the giant flames leaped from one stretch of parched land to another			0
with high temperatures -- it hit 98 degrees in @entity132 on monday -- and dry fuel in the fire 's path , firefighters faced tough conditions in a race to contain the blaze			1
hotshot crews are elite firefighters sunday was the deadliest day for firefighters since the 9/11 attacks			1
and it is the deadliest wildland fire since 1933 , when 25 firefighters died as a blaze burned in light chaparral near @entity212 , @entity213 , according to a list from the @entity104 @entity215			1
@entity216 , spokeswoman for the incident command team charged with fighting the blaze , said the cause of the firefighters ' deaths is being investigated , and answers might come in the next three days			1
authorities have information that during the blaze , the firefighters deployed their fire shelters			1
the shelters must be timed well			2
set it up too soon , and the heat inside the shelter can become suffocating			0
deploy it too late , and the fire is already on top of you			2
wearing gloves , a firefighter will lie on the ground under the shelter , the ground being the only thing keeping the firefighter cool			0
the shelter will block 100 % of the heat from flames and hot gases and 95 % of the radiant heat from the flames themselves			0
wildfires : fast facts drivers fleeing the area were chased by dark plumes filling the air			0
some evacuees paused to look from afar , wondering if the flames had torched their homes			0
the blaze had n't touched @entity44 yet			1
but like many other fire departments across the state , the @entity44 team jumped in to help			1
" a hotshot crew are the elite firefighters , " state forestry spokesman @entity263 said			1
" they 're usually ( a ) 20 - person crew , and they 're the ones who actually go in and dig the fire line , cut the brush to make a fuel break			1
and so they would be as close to the fire as they felt they safely could			2
" " in normal circumstances , when you 're digging fire line , you make sure you have a good escape route , and you have a safety zone set up , " @entity263 said			2
" evidently , their safety zone was n't big enough , and the fire just overtook them			2
" ' words cant describe the loss ' one of the firefighters -- @entity61 , the son of a @entity289 fire captain -- joined the @entity44 unit just three months ago			1
@entity61 , an avid outdoorsman , always wanted to be a firefighter like his father , @entity291 told " @entity294 " on monday evening			2
@entity291 said he last talked to his son by phone on sunday morning			0
" he said , ' @entity298 , we got a fire in @entity132 , @entity15			2
... i 'll give you a call later , ' " the elder @entity61 recalled			0
he said it has n't sunk in yet that he wo n't get that phone call			0
