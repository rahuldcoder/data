-- director @entity1 has won countless film awards			1
his works , including " @entity4 : the @entity6 , " " @entity7 " and " @entity8 , " are considered classics			0
he 's been recognized for his artistic passion , his eccentricities ( he once ate a shoe after losing a bet ) and his disdain for many aspects of commercialism			2
so why is @entity1 doing a public - service documentary on the perils of texting and driving ? sponsored by a consortium of cellular carriers , no less ? why , the man does n't even own a cell phone			1
but he looks at the statistics for texting - while - driving incidents -- as well as our smartphone obsession and its cost in simple human contact -- and recognizes the necessity of saying something			1
" i immediately understood there was something very , very important ( about the subject ) , " he said via @entity30 from @entity31			0
@entity1 's new work , a short film called " @entity1 , " premiered last week online			1
sponsored by it can wait , a driver - safety campaign launched by @entity40 in 2009 that now includes @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , it 's received more than 1.7 million views on @entity45 and will be distributed to more than 40,000 high schools in the coming months			1
the film chronicles the impact of four incidents in which texting and driving led to catastrophic injury or death			1
the first left a @entity56 child , @entity55 , a paraplegic after he was hit by a driver who ran a stop sign			0
the second is about an @entity62 man , @entity61 , who rear - ended a horse - driven buggy and killed three members of an @entity67 family			1
the third profiles a brain - damaged @entity70 woman , @entity69 , hit while walking her dog			2
the film concludes with a @entity74 man , @entity73 , whose distracted driving caused a chain reaction that left two men dead and a third severely injured			1
each story has the kinds of small , wrenching details that @entity1 , in typical style , underplays			1
@entity55 's mother says she sleeps on the couch , listening for changes in the rhythm of her boy 's ventilator			2
@entity69 's family says her chocolate lab was thrown through the air , knocked down a distant mailbox and -- before he died -- wagged his tail as @entity69 was placed in the ambulance			2
the men whose text - checking led to tragedy sit on roadsides , pondering the moment their lives changed			1
but @entity1 points to another incident , one that did n't make the film , as representative of the problem			1
a young man , while texting his girlfriend , hit a boy on a bicycle			2
the boy died ; the man is now in prison			0
" the young man was texting with his girlfriend , and the girlfriend was right next to him , " @entity1 said			1
" in the same car			0
" ' a powerful storyteller ' @entity1 admits he 's an unlikely choice to direct such a film			1
unlike some of his colleagues , he does n't do commercials , and his subject matter is famously varied , whether it 's @entity124 cave drawings or a lone air - crash survivor			1
but @entity126 , @entity40 's executive director for integrated brand marketing , says @entity1 made sense			1
he was approached through the firm 's ad agency , @entity132 @entity131			2
" he 's really such a powerful storyteller			2
he does a great job of bringing to life the juxtaposition of an insignificant text with a very dire and significant consequence , " she said			0
that 's been part of @entity143 's goal since it started four years ago			2
the program is aimed at teens and adults from 16 to 25 , people who text frequently but are inexperienced drivers , says @entity126			0
it 's not just the kids who can benefit , though			2
an @entity40 survey in march indicated that adults text and drive more than teenagers do -- even though they know it 's wrong			2
it 's a tough point to bring home			2
@entity0 comments on that story varied between finger - wagging and shrugs , with neither side willing to concede			2
" jail time , i say ... give ' em jail time			0
period , " said @entity164			0
" it is possible to safely text and drive , but they would prefer to use paranoia and misinformation to push their agenda , " retorted @entity165			0
@entity1 's documentary , with its intimate , raw interviews , delicate music and frequent silences , may seem a poor prod to get texting drivers to change their ways			1
a @entity180 @entity179 that begins with a terrifying car crash and a goodly share of gore ( discretion advised ) may seem more effective , a modern - day version of the old drivers - ed film " @entity187			1
" but @entity1 believes his style is more effective			1
" in this case what immediately connected to audiences , younger audiences , was the kind of deep insight , the interior appearance of the catastrophes , " he said			0
" i do n't need to show any gore , blood or car wrecks			0
" @entity40 's research backs him up , says @entity126			2
' i 'm very glad i did this ' laws regarding texting and driving are uneven			1
in most states , the practice is banned , but the punishments vary greatly			0
in " @entity1 , " the @entity70 driver who hurt @entity69 received a 30 - day jail term and some community service ; her insurance company paid $ 50,000 , though @entity69 's medical bills topped $ 1 million			1
@entity1 hopes the film prompts stronger legislation , but he 's bluntly realistic about the possibilities			1
" what 's more important than legislation is awareness , " he said			0
" you ca n't legislate stupidity			0
" awareness , at least , is high , particularly thanks to the director			0
the @entity223 , referencing the film , ran an editorial on texting and driving thursday ; a broad range of media outlets including @entity227 , @entity228 , the @entity229 and @entity230 have featured the documentary in articles			1
@entity234 's @entity233 called it " the greatest and most disturbing driver 's ed movie of all time			0
" @entity1 , whose films generally fare better with critics than the box office , seems a little dazed at the attention			1
" it has shown that real filmmaking somehow connects to an unbelievable amount of people in a very quick period of time , " he said			0
" it 's going through the roof			0
i 'm very glad i did this			0
" but it 's the idea of reaching even one young driver that really moves him			0
" one single accident less , and i have done the right thing , " he said			0
he mentions an e-mail he received from a 15 - year - old girl who watched " @entity1 " and immediately had a talk with her mother			1
" ( she wrote , ) ' i sat my mother down and told her , you are texting and driving			1
you are not going to do that anymore			0
not when you take me to school , ' " he said			0
" and the mother stopped it			0
so the signals are good			0
