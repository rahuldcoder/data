@entity0 -- assisted by a colorful cast of characters , @entity3 funnymen @entity2 and @entity4 held a raucous rally on the @entity8 saturday in typical fashion before a cheering throng of supporters			1
amidst all the hilarity , however , the " @entity19 " carried a message about @entity14 turning their backs on hate and working together to make the world a better place			2
@entity2 and @entity4 staged a mock battle , with @entity2 supporting peace and sanity and @entity4 promoting fear before a crowd that stretched nearly the length of the mall , most of the distance between the @entity29 and the @entity30			1
during the rally 's opening , @entity4 appeared on a video screen , saying he was trapped in his " fear bunker " and worried no one had shown up			1
drawn by cheers , however , @entity4 ascended to the stage in a device like that used to bring up the trapped @entity41 miners earlier this month , wearing a superhero costume			2
former " @entity44 " character @entity43 -- played by comedian @entity45 -- provided a benediction , thanking @entity47 for " making it so easy to find parking spaces			2
" and actor @entity54 of " @entity55 " fame read a poem entitled " are you sure ? " about fears including " funnel clouds and hail / @entity59 in the mail ... someone 's robbing your house / i can see through your blouse / your mother was right , you chose the wrong spouse			2
" @entity64 , who now goes by @entity64 , sang his song " @entity66 " as part of a duel with @entity69 singing " @entity70			1
" @entity2 stopped @entity69 , rooting for @entity71 , as @entity4 urged @entity69 on			1
the two compromised on the @entity72 , who showed up to sing their hit " @entity75			1
" @entity1 's @entity76 on the rally @entity80 and " @entity81 " robot @entity78 provided a lesson in tolerance and against stereotyping			1
" we 're all on the same team , " said @entity80 , referencing @entity4 and @entity2 's discussion about @entity86			1
there were some serious notes struck during the event , however			2
@entity92 and @entity93 performed a musical number about changing the world , including the lyrics , " the least that i can do is care			0
" " this was not a rally to ridicule people of faith , or people of activism , or to look down our noses at the heartland , or passionate argument , or to suggest that times are not difficult and we have nothing to fear , " @entity2 told the crowd as the rally drew to a close			1
" they are , and we do			0
but we live now in hard times , not end times			0
and we can have animus and not be enemies , but unfortunately one of our main tools in delineating the two broke			0
" he was speaking of what he called " the country 's 24 - hour politico pundit perpetual panic conflictinator			0
" it did not cause the nation 's problems , @entity2 said , " but its existence makes solving them that much harder ... if we amplify everything , we hear nothing			1
" crowd : serve us up sanity , not tea " there are terrorists and racists and @entity138 and theocrats , but those are titles that must be earned , " @entity2 said			1
" you must have the resume			0
not being able to distinguish between real racists and tea partiers , or real bigots and @entity146 or @entity147 is an insult , not only to those people , but to the racists themselves , who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate -- just as the inability to distinguish terrorists from @entity86 makes us less safe , not more			0
" most @entity14 , he said , do n't live their lives solely as @entity159 or @entity160 , but as " people who are just a little bit late for something they have to do , often something they do not want to do			2
" some may paint the nation as fragile and torn by hate , he said , " but the truth is ... we work together to get things done every damn day			0
" " there will always be darkness , and sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel is n't the promised land , " @entity2 said			1
" sometimes it 's just @entity180			0
but we do it anyway , together			0
" after the rally , @entity2 and @entity4 deflected questions from reporters about whether they would attempt to parlay the rally into a sustained movement			1
" we 're not running for anything , " @entity2 said at the @entity187			1
" we do n't have a constituency , " he said			2
" we do television shows for people that like them and we hope that they continue to like them so that @entity3 can continue to sell beer to young people			0
" " we wanted to do a really good show for people that wanted it , " he said of the rally			2
asked what his next steps would be , @entity4 said , " we have a show on monday and we have to go write that and we have a live show tuesday			0
" at the rally , @entity2 awarded his " @entity217 " to recipients including @entity210 pitcher @entity209 , who lost a perfect game in june when an umpire mistakenly called what would have been the last batter safe at first base despite the fact replays showed he was clearly out			1
@entity209 , who lives in @entity218 , accepted via videotape , telling the audience the umpire is " a good man			0
" another recipient was @entity223 , chief financial officer for @entity225 , who challenged president @entity227 at a town hall meeting in september ; and comedian and wrestler @entity230 ; and @entity231			0
a video of @entity231 telling how he swiped a kerosene - soaked quran from would - be burners , telling them , " dude , you have no quran , " went viral , and was set to a dance mix. @entity4 's " @entity242 " went to recipients including a 7 - year - old girl who he said had more courage than the media organizations who did not send representatives to cover the rally out of fear they would appear biased , as well as to " @entity250 's tight black t - shirt			2
" @entity4 said that when @entity1 's @entity250 " shows up on your front yard , you know something terrible has happened in your community			0
" a small black t - shirt was brought on stage on a hanger , and the medal hung on it			0
@entity2 and @entity4 announced the rally in september , less than three weeks after conservative talk - show host @entity262 hosted a much - publicized " @entity265 " rally on the @entity8 , urging large crowds to " turn back to @entity47 " and return @entity14 to the values on which it was founded			1
