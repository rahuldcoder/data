-- @entity1 has been taking her son with her when she votes ever since he was born			2
they 've been talking about politics since he was 4			2
now 7 years old , @entity5 likes to say that he 's going to become a science teacher -- and the president of the @entity8			2
@entity1 herself was raised by a politically motivated mom and accompanied her on @entity11 marches when she was as young as 8			1
it inspired her to become a political blogger , both with @entity14 and her own blog , @entity16			1
tackling heated discussions , educating yourself about issues and getting candid about candidates can be difficult , even for the politically inclined			1
but political mom bloggers have taken the challenge to a new level : combining the delicate art form of being a parent with being politically active , and including their children in the entire process			1
" i think it 's really important to raise children with a sense of public responsibility , " @entity1 said			2
" one of the values i want to instill in my son is this idea that as an @entity8 citizen , he 's responsible for paying attention to what the government is doing so later , when he 's old enough to vote , he 's empowered to make rational decisions			2
" @entity5 may not be running for president any time soon , but he 's on the right track			2
children inherently possess a sense of fairness , which makes them prime candidates for political understanding and conversations , @entity1 said			1
while reaching out on a smaller scale than other parenting - centric mom blogs , these politically motivated websites are a great way to connect like - minded mothers and share ideas			1
these blogs tend to become increasingly active around elections , @entity1 said			1
@entity58 was one of only 55 national blogs to attend the @entity60			2
" the blog had literally been started in 2007 by three moms talking over coffee in a cafe , " @entity1 said			0
" so we personally felt like recognition as legitimate press from the @entity60 was a pretty powerful sign that the trend of mothers blogging about politics was being taken seriously by the political establishment and the wider media			1
" in addition to political blogging , these moms try to incorporate politics into their home life			1
@entity80 's kids would n't be as interested in politics if their family were n't so actively involved			0
while she is holding a central committee meeting in the gym , her kids are playing basketball just a few feet away			0
" when parents become involved and talk about it , you become a model for your kids , and then they understand that it 's their responsibility to seek out news and information you can trust and make solid decisions on , " said @entity80 , a conservative who runs the @entity90 blog			0
she was also an official blogger for the @entity100			0
@entity80 's reasons for being so politically active run deep			1
her grandmother once posed the question , " why do you keep having these children ? why would you want them to grow up in this world ? " @entity80 knew that she had to do something to make a difference in the world her children were growing up in , and that route was politics			0
blogging as a politically inclined mother has connected her with both like - minded and opposing party - affiliated women all across the country			1
while there may be tension between their differing views on issues , @entity80 considers the political mom blogger movement to be a beautiful thing			1
" when women start to collaborate , there 's this warm , holistic nature , " she said			0
" we may be affiliated with different parties , but we come to a consensus and an understanding when the day is over			0
both online and at conferences , i just see so much ' come together			0
' " her 10 - year - old son , @entity135 , is getting caught up in the spell of the election because while his dad has picked a favorite in the political season , @entity138 has not			1
" he likes to set himself up right between us and ask questions about how we make our decisions , " @entity80 said			0
" he asks what we 're looking for if we 're watching one of the debates , he asks who 's asking the question , why do they want to know , what 's the reporter , what 's their role ? " in fact , these mom bloggers say there has never been a more exciting or engaging time for kids to become interested in some facet of the election scene			1
" as they talk about issues in school or they come up naturally in history or social studies classes , your kids come home and talk about that , " said @entity161 , the mind behind the @entity164 blog			0
" we 're in an election season and that provides a good opportunity to have a conversation , if you want to			0
" while @entity161 and her husband align with progressive @entity60 politics , they do n't want to influence their daughter or her future decisions			0
this age range , " between the elementary and tween years , " can be a great time to have political discussions with kids , but it is also incredibly easy to sway their views			1
@entity161 takes the same kind of balanced approach that she sees in some of the families she interviewed for her book , " @entity195			0
" she has witnessed a trend of families aiming to indoctrinate their kids with hyperpartisan politics , but does n't agree with it			1
instead , she suggests explaining all partisan beliefs and objectives , even if they do n't align with your own			0
" our kids understand there is more than one side to every issue , " she said			0
" i tell them , we may believe this , but there are other people who think this other thing for varying reasons			0
" @entity215 , founder of @entity217 blog , tries to keep her party affiliation as a separate entity from her children , although she actively talks about politics with them often			1
politics actually bring her family together			0
" as a political activist myself , i ca n't help but talk with my kids about why i take the stands i do , " she said			1
" after all , i share my values about everything else in my life -- i tell them why i recycle , why i drive the speed limit , why i eat my vegetables , and i tell them why i prefer @entity235 to @entity236 , so i might as well explain why i voted for @entity237 ! " @entity238 takes her kids with her to abortion rights rallies , candidate events , marches and even a few @entity244 - allied demonstrations in @entity245 and @entity246			0
she encourages them that while they are n't old enough to vote now , they can still be a part of the political process with her			1
her children are becoming activists in their own right			0
" the even greater reward of their childhood activism , though , will be growing into adults who are confident that they have the ability to participate in the political process , no matter where on the liberal / conservative spectrum they eventually fall , " she said			1
" civic engagement is an important part of being a healthy , fully rounded person			0
" while some moms have the ability to be actively involved in their community or work directly in politics , not all mothers have that ability			2
blogging about parenting and politics connects them to this sphere			2
they can talk about the two topics separately , or how to talk about political news with their kids			2
" we do n't talk to our neighbors as much as we used to , so the online community helps , " @entity1 said			1
" the internet is a wonderful outlet , a great place for women to connect and share parenting experiences			2
this movement has the potential to create new common - ground alliances between women with very different backgrounds			0

@entity138 bloggers are tackling the challenges of parenting and being politically active
no matter their party affiliation , these bloggers agree that the community aspect helps them
