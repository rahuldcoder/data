-- rumors that the @entity4 or @entity5 were somehow involved in the sex crime accusations against @entity8 founder and editor @entity7 in @entity10 are " complete nonsense , " the attorney for the alleged victims said tuesday			1
@entity12 of the @entity10 law firm @entity12 and @entity14 said the two women he represents have nothing to do with any kind of conspiracy			2
" what i can say is that those rumors that the @entity4 or the @entity5 are supposed to be involved lack all connection with reality , " @entity12 said from @entity19 , @entity10			1
the women " have been subjected to sexual crimes , and the added pressure of the intense worldwide media interest has been very hard on them , " he added			0
a warrant issued friday for @entity7 in @entity10 listed charges of rape and molestation , but it was revoked less than a day later by chief prosecutor @entity32			1
@entity32 said monday that she had not spoken to @entity7			2
@entity33 , the lawyer representing @entity7 , said tuesday that his client strongly denies all the accusations			1
" his view is that he has not done anything that is morally and legally wrong , " @entity33 said			0
he also denounced the prosecutor who identified @entity7 to the media			1
" normally they should neither confirm nor deny the identity of a suspect , but in this case the prosecutor made two serious mistakes : the first was that she so quickly arrested @entity7 in his absence over a very serious crime without finding out all facts first			1
the second was that she confirmed his identity to the media			0
that , to me , almost constitutes a serious misconduct , " @entity33 said			0
the website founded by @entity7 , @entity8 , has triggered controversy by recently posting 76,000 @entity60 documents related to the war in @entity62 , a move that has drawn criticism from both the @entity60 and @entity62			1
another 15,000 documents are to be released soon , @entity7 has said			2
he told the @entity67 - language television network @entity66 on sunday that the accusations are " clearly a smear campaign			2
" " the only question is , who was involved ? " he asked			0
he told the @entity10 daily newspaper @entity72 in a story sunday that he does n't know who was behind it , " but we have been warned that , for example , the @entity4 is planning on using dirty tricks to destroy our work			1
" he said he was also warned about " sex traps			1
" asked by the paper whether he has fallen for one of those traps , he said , " maybe			0
" when asked monday whether the @entity4 had any involvement in the charges or the allegations , @entity4 spokesman @entity84 replied , " no , that 's ridiculous			1
" @entity90 spokesman @entity89 also denied that the department had any involvement in the situation			0
@entity33 declined to comment on the conspiracy allegations			0
@entity12 said the two alleged victims contacted him over the weekend , and he met with them monday			1
one is about 25 years old , and the other woman is about 35 years old , he said , but he did not want to give any more details about his clients for fear that they 'll be identified			0
" i also ca n't give any details of the events			0
@entity7 has not been heard yet , and giving out any details could interfere with the investigation , " @entity12 said			2
" what i can say is that these are two @entity10 women who have had two experiences completely independent of one another			2
they are not friends from before , but these events were connected with @entity7 's tour in @entity10			1
" @entity12 says @entity7 's actions should be classified as at least sexual molestation			1
" i understand why the prosecutor judged one incident as rape			0
my judgment is that the two women have been subjected to at least sexual molestation , " he said , adding that there are still many questions about the incidents that need to be answered			0
@entity7 told @entity72 that he had never , " either in @entity10 nor in any other country , had sex with anyone in a way that was not based on both sides being completely voluntary			1
" @entity12 also criticized the prosecutor for not questioning @entity7 immediately in the case			1
" it is obvious that he is a suspect of sex crimes , and if he leaves the country , then we may never be able to hear his explanation , " the attorney explained			2
the fear that @entity7 might leave @entity10 was apparently what provoked the warrant last week , according to a statement posted monday on the @entity140 's website			1
the prosecutor " decided that @entity7 was to be arrested , " based on information that police gave her over the phone about the allegations -- a typical procedure , authorities said			1
" the prosecutor was also made aware that the individual concerned was a foreign national and that he was about to leave the country , " the chronology said			2
one reason for issuing the warrant was " that there was a risk that he would have time to leave the country before authorities had time to interrogate him			2
there was also a risk that he could have interfered with the investigation			0
" a group that claims to work to protect individuals ' legal rights in the @entity10 justice system said monday that it has reported the on - call prosecutor to the @entity10 parliamentary ombudsman of justice			1
it was unclear what action , if any , the ombudsman could take against the prosecutor			0
" we can see that , time after time , prosecutors do n't follow the @entity10 objectivity laws , " said @entity172 , founder of the @entity173			1
" when accusations come in , prosecutors do n't even check facts before they take coercive measures , and this is contrary to @entity10 laws			2
in this case , the prosecutor only listened to one individual 's story but did n't bother checking the other side of the story before accusing mr. @entity7 of a very serious crime			1
this is why we have reported her			0
" news of the warrant reached a @entity10 media outlet , the prosecution authority said , but " the authority does not know how this happened , and the authority is not allowed to investigate this			1
" under @entity10 law , news outlets are protected from police investigations into their sources			2
the news organization contacted the on - call prosecutor friday night , the authority said			0
" once the on - call prosecutor was made aware that the news organization already knew all the details in the case , she confirmed that there was such a case ongoing and that it involved @entity7			1
" however , she provided no details to the media , the authority said			0
" this is very important , especially in cases involving sex crimes , since information about the individuals involved must be protected			0
this is governed by @entity10 privacy laws			2
" after the news broke in the media on saturday , the on - call prosecutor " came under intense pressure " and it became clear the case needed to be transferred to someone else so that she could continue her usual duties , the prosecution authority said			0
@entity32 was then appointed lead investigator and immediately began looking into the case , the authority said			0
she made the decision saturday to revoke the warrant " because she did not consider it possible to suspect him of rape , " the statement said			0
" the amount of information available to her was more extensive than what the on - call prosecutor had on friday evening			0
exactly what that information was can not be disclosed at this point , since the investigation is ongoing			0
" @entity7 said the on - call prosecutor should be criticized , as well as the media " who so blindly reported these accusations			1
" @entity32 , however , said in a statement monday , " my decision that mr. @entity7 should no longer be arrested in his absence because he could not be suspected of rape is by no means criticism of the decision of the duty prosecutor			1
i had access to more information on saturday than the duty prosecutor had on friday			0
" @entity7 told @entity72 that he was at a friend 's cottage in northern @entity10 and had initially planned to stay until wednesday but was delaying his departure for reasons unrelated to the investigation			1
@entity10 media , citing unnamed sources , reported that the two women reported the allegations to police , which led to the warrant			1
@entity72 said the older woman told the newspaper that the younger woman had approached her with a story similar to hers : that she had consensual sex with @entity7 but that the situation had turned abusive			1
@entity285 , spokeswoman for the prosecution authority , would not confirm those reports			0
@entity32 has " still not decided what other potential offenses [ @entity7 ] may be suspected of in the incident previously labeled rape , " the prosecution authority 's statement said			1
" she also has not yet decided on the suspected molestation			0
the investigation is still ongoing and the suspicions against @entity7 are still there			2
" @entity285 said monday that if @entity7 is convicted of molestation , he could face a sentence of up to a year in jail			2
prosecutors may also request in court that he be held in jail while awaiting trial , she said			0
@entity285 earlier had said he would not face jail time if convicted of molestation but corrected that monday			0
@entity0 's @entity307 and @entity308 contributed to this report .			0
