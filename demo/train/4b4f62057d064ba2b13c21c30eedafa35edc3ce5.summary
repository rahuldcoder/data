@entity0 , @entity1 -- for 1st lt. @entity6 the golden day of coming home from a lengthy deployment in @entity5 was everything he had dreamed it would be			1
" the day i came home from deployment was just euphoric , " recalls @entity6 , who is part of the @entity10			1
somebody dropped me off at home , and the kids are all running out and hugs and kisses			0
" but as @entity6 had been warned the honeymoon welcome home period would soon be over and hard work lay ahead			1
" yes , the first day back is just a fairy tale , of course			2
and then you have to start trying to put yourself back into the life of your family			1
" " and of course they 've been working with you gone for a year , and they 've changed how they do things			0
i was advised to expect that and also to try not to come back and suddenly be in charge			2
i did n't listen to that advice			0
" @entity6 , who has been with the guard for seven years is married and has three young children , @entity34 , 9 , @entity35 , 4 , and @entity36 , 3 , who was born while @entity6 was deployed			1
he knew of many of his friends also deployed were going through tougher times			0
divorces were not uncommon , nor were separations			0
his wife @entity42 offers some advice : " it 's not like if there was anything broken before deployment , it 's all of a sudden going to be fixed			2
" mrs. @entity48 knows what she is talking about			0
she 's in the armed forces and was herself deployed during 9/11 to @entity51			0
she admits it 's hard to seamlessly re-introduce a spouse who has been gone for so long			0
" welcoming the old husband back , it 's a brand new feeling of ' yeah you 're new , and i like you and you smell nice , " @entity6 said			1
" and then there is this ' no this is my routine , and my part of the dresser , and do n't take this over			0
' it 's kind of mixed up			0
" mixed up all right and entirely too common			0
@entity63 knows all about the new normal for family life after deployment			1
in fact she and her team at the @entity67 are conducting a five - year program trying to help just those families affected			2
" deployment is tough , " @entity63 said			2
" it 's tough when one parent is away and the other parent is single parenting			0
but the most stressful time is when families have to kind of reconstitute and parents have to get back on the same page and that can be really tough			1
" the program is called @entity82 and stands for after @entity83 : @entity84			1
it 's only offered in @entity1 to deployed parents with school age kids			2
the 14 - week class offers skills and tools to help the transition back into family mode			1
the premise is that if the parents are stressed , parenting suffers and that trickles down to the kids			2
" when you have been in combat , there are sights and sounds and smells and even tastes that remind you of terrible things , " @entity63 said , " and so everyone who comes back from an environment where you had to react not respond because you could be killed if you did n't react instantaneously , they 'll have to recalibrate their emotional responding			1
" @entity82 teaches parents to learn to take a pause before they start , for example , yelling at their kids if they drop their backpacks on the floor			1
their approach is to take a breath , maybe even leave the room			0
then when their initial fear over hearing loud noises has passed , go back to their kids and instruct them in just what want them to do			2
in this case , put backpacks where they belong			0
" going to the ( @entity82 ) classes i realized how many things we were doing wrong , " said @entity6			1
the couple completed the program some months ago and gives it credit for making his re-integration back into family life a lot easier			1
" frankly we were turning into the yelling , shouting parents that if a child is n't doing what they are supposed to be doing we just keep saying it over and over again louder to their faces until they comply			2
" now @entity6 explains he has a new approach			1
" you ca n't yell from another room ' @entity145 your room ! ' because they 're not going to understand that			0
you have to get down to their level , maybe put a hand on them and look them in the eye and say , ' hey you need to clean your room right now , please			0
' " according to the @entity159 , just a few of these simple tools and techniques have greatly lowered the level of stress felt in the household			1
tools , techniques and most importantly communication seems to be at the forefront for making the transition easier on those that have been deployed as well as their families who have stayed behind			1
@entity63 sums it up this way , " when families do n't communicate , there is a sense of walking on eggshells especially with someone who has come back with lots of scars			1
there is a sense that if we talk about it , it will be worse because it 's so painful			0
but our treatment of @entity184 indicates that exposure or talking about it is really the key to recovery , and i think that is no less true in a family context			0
" as for the @entity6 family , they are doing just fine			1
with the help of the @entity82 tools , lots of communication and a good and ever ready sense of humor , they thrive			1
but on top of that @entity6 has some good advice for those soon to be coming home : " listen to what you are being told about how hard it is , because it is that hard			2
and do n't expect it to be fantastic when you get back			0
" in fact he suggests : " lower them a lot and then you 'll be pleasantly surprised			0

for returning troops , getting back into the family *dynamic* is not easy
1st lt. @entity6 *struggled* transitioning after a deployment to @entity5
the @entity82 program teaches parents tools and techniques to make *reintegration* easier
when parents bare emotional and *physical* scars , communicating more helps
