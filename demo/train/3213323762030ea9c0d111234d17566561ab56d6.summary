-- when @entity2 was shot for demanding that @entity4 girls receive an education , the world took notice			1
but the din from the 15 year - old 's assassination attempt by the @entity9 resonated perhaps most loudly for people like @entity11 , the co-founder of the @entity12			1
" after the reality of what happened settled in , it only emphasized how important our mission is , " @entity13 said			1
in january 2012 , the @entity19 was formed to promote the educational and economic advancement of @entity23 women and girls			2
the fund is a special project of @entity27 and has funded pilot projects in @entity4 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity33 territories			1
@entity13 's mission with the @entity19 is a simple concept with complex realities			1
the philanthropy supports @entity23 women and girls and their communities by investing in strategic and innovative nongovernmental organizations			2
the fund tries to accomplish this goal in societies where there is no level playing field for women			1
" according to data from the @entity50 , muslims represent 22 % of the world 's population , " @entity13 said			2
" yet muslim - majority countries only contribute 11.2 % to global gdp			0
there are more than 800 million @entity23 women and girls in the world who represent an eighth of the world 's population , but gender disparities contribute to the gap in global gdp			1
" but @entity13 says the @entity19 knows that the approach in @entity23 societies needs to be sensitive to the local culture in order to work			0
in @entity29 , the group partners with the @entity69 and @entity70 to train 100 imams and 25 active female leaders to address women 's rights across madrassas , or religious schools , in the war - ravaged country			1
the program is changing the way women are perceived			1
@entity13 describes an incident after one of the friday sermons when an elderly man spoke out , clearly moved by the experience			0
" he said , ' i have committed all sorts of violence against my daughters			0
i have received walwar ( bride price ) for them			0
i stopped them from getting an education			2
they are suffering every day because of my wrongs			0
why were these imams not talking on these issues before ? ' " @entity13 says that reaction is evidence that the program is working			2
" men are very much a part of the solution			0
without engaging men and boys in some aspect of our work , the sustainability of the varied projects could be adversely impacted , " she said			0
" this training effort is an important step in dispelling the myths of human rights in @entity23 and combating domestic violence			0
" the project , in partnership with he @entity69 and @entity70 , is also a @entity122			2
director @entity123 says the program is its own kind of revolution because religious leaders once known for oppressing women now use the words of the @entity130 to promote fairness for them			1
" these imams then have to work with other imams and preach the issue of women rights during the @entity138 ( friday sermons ) to the public attending the prayers , so by this way we could reach thousands of people both male and female , " @entity123 wrote in an e-mail			2
a similar project in neighboring @entity4 is also under way			0
teacher training in female madrassas in @entity4 was broadened to include subjects such as math , science , history , gender equality , non-violence and human rights			0
@entity13 said this project was particularly successful because the local tribal leaders believed in its importance			1
" we know how important it is to work within the local communities to address these challenges and opportunities in a way that is non-threatening to their environment			0
@entity12 believes that these challenges are global but the solutions are indeed local , " @entity13 said			0
the fact that these programs are occurring in regions plagued by conflict is not lost on organizers who say the prospect of gender equality promotes peace			1
" peace and prosperity abroad means peace and prosperity for all of us in @entity182 , " @entity13 said			0
" it 's in our national interest to invest in women and girls			1

@entity2 's shooting *reinforces* program 's mission

the program is changing the way women are perceived
project was successful because tribal leaders believed in its importance
