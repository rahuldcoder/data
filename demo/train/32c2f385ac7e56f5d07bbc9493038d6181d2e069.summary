@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was a @entity4 , @entity5 , who laid out the blueprint for getting elected president : in the primary , you court the extremes to please the party 's base ; in the general election , you race to the center to get as many votes as possible			1
but nowadays , candidates in both parties tend to follow it			2
many voters have probably become used to the idea that candidates go through this moderate makeover			2
this year , however , there is a twist			0
only one of the major candidates is in the center , and it 's not the @entity4			1
the candidate on the right is staying put , well , on the right			0
when @entity35 spoke wednesday to the annual conference of the @entity37 , the presumptive @entity4 presidential nominee did not sugarcoat his opposition to president @entity40 's policies , especially the president 's health - care overhaul , which @entity35 promised to eliminate along with " every non-essential , expensive program " he could find			1
that pledge was met with a loud chorus of boos that lasted more than 10 seconds			0
still , @entity35 did n't back down			1
he deserves credit for addressing a group that is so heavily invested in @entity40 , and even more credit for not turning himself inside out to be liked			1
he also maintained his composure a few weeks ago when he addressed the annual conference of the @entity53			0
@entity35 did n't apologize for taking a hard - line against illegal immigration during the @entity4 primary to the point of portraying illegal immigrants as takers who hurt the economy and drain social services			1
nor did he say he was wrong for opposing the @entity63 , which would have given legal status to undocumented immigrants who go to college or join the military			0
in my opinion , @entity35 should have said those things			1
he has a lot for which to apologize			0
after the @entity37 speech , one @entity35 adviser privately told a reporter for the @entity75 that @entity35 has presented basically the same agenda to every audience throughout the campaign , and he commended the candidate for not backing away from positions that the audience was likely to find unpopular , like repealing @entity82			1
political observers can argue over why they think this is happening			0
maybe @entity35 only knows how to give one generic speech			1
maybe he 's not comfortable pandering to special interest groups , especially those with an ethnic or racial agenda			0
from other things i 've read , i think that @entity35 and his campaign advisers are terrified of him being labeled a " flip - flopper " and that this dissuades them from making any sharp turns or dramatic course corrections			2
more than anything , they want to do something that @entity35 has had trouble doing in the past : appear steady and consistent			2
meanwhile , president @entity40 has had liberal supporters scratch their heads as he claimed for his own a series of conservative positions that they oppose			1
this is not simply an election year gimmick			0
it has been going on for sometime			0
in fact , if you ignore what @entity40 says and focus only on what he does , you 'll see that @entity40 has actually spent most of his presidency in the center , even , on some issues , following the example of his predecessor			1
while neither liberals nor conservatives are eager to admit it , they can no longer deny it : @entity124 are living through @entity126 's third term			1
@entity40 loves to criticize the 43rd president , almost as much as he loves to emulate him			1
in the war on terror , aspects of foreign policy , education reform , immigration , corporate bailouts and a host of other issues with the exception of health care reform , @entity40 has taken up the sorts of positions that conservatives usually champion			2
and the left has noticed , which is why the president now and then gets blowback from parts of the same liberal coalition that helped elect him			0
they must wonder what happened to the person they helped put in office , and many of these disillusioned liberals now talk about voting for @entity40 as the " lesser of two evils			2
" the president 's decision this week to extend the @entity126 tax cuts for incomes under $ 250,000 is just the latest example of the president taking his cues from the former president that liberals love to hate			1
( true , @entity40 is campaigning against the part of the @entity126 tax cuts that applied to income above $ 250,000			1
) we 'll soon know which of these strategies proves more successful in garnering votes : moving to the center , or staying the course			2
there are advantages and liabilities to each			0
of course , what would really be nice and refreshing , is , if just once , someone running for president on a major party ticket took positions not to manipulate the outcome of an election but because he believed they were the correct positions to take			0
maybe @entity40 and @entity35 are doing that			1
maybe what we 're hearing is what they really believe			0
it 's hard to tell			0
and even harder to believe			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity194 : presidential candidates *typically* move to the center after primaries
he says this year , @entity35 is staying on the right , and @entity40 continues to take centrist stands
he says president has *governed* as if this was the third term of @entity126
