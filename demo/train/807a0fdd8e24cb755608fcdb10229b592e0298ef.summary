-- does your dog object to vacationing in a cage ? ca n't count on your brother - in - law to commit to dog - sitting for two weeks ? now there are home stay websites for four - legged creatures			1
frustrated with kennels that keep dogs cooped up and charge extra for petting and walks , the founders of @entity9 and @entity10 are connecting dog lovers who want to earn extra cash with travelers who want dog - friendly people to care for their pets close to home while they 're away			1
@entity21 founders @entity22 and @entity23 loved getting away when they first moved in together but hated taking their dogs to the kennel			1
" every time we traveled , the dogs hated the kennel and came back with kennel cough , " said @entity22			1
and they paid up to $ 120 a day for the privilege			1
when they took their dogs to a local trainer 's home instead , the animals came back happy and rested			1
it was as if the dogs had been on vacation , too			1
so they decided to host dogs with traveling owners in their home			1
with @entity23 working at home , he had plenty of time to bike and run with the dogs and keep them company			1
the couple found an incredible demand for their services , which culminated in the launch of @entity21 last month			2
@entity10 launched in @entity55 in november and went national this week , attracting over 10,000 people signing up to both host dogs and use the services of dog hosts			1
@entity60 launched in march and already has had 6,000 people apply to be hosts across the country ( 1700 have been accepted so far )			1
similar to a dating site or @entity66 rental site , hosts fill out detailed profiles about their canine experience , including training , medical certification and licensing qualifications ; the size and dog - friendliness of their homes and any resident dogs or other animals on site			1
some hosts specifically will take puppies that are n't ready for their vaccinations yet and others will not take dogs that do n't like children			1
customers also fill out detailed profiles of their dogs , behavior issues and medical or other special needs			1
fees start at around $ 15 per day for smaller apartments with hosts who are dog lovers to much higher fees for dog trainers with large yards where dogs can roam			1
extra services , like a departure day bath , can often be had for an extra fee			2
owners can even get photos or videos texts or emails sent to their mobile phones			0
@entity10 ceo @entity106 , formerly in advertising for @entity108 , would get upset at the thought of @entity110 , his 4 - pound @entity111 , getting stressed out before he leaves on a trip			0
" every time i leave town , i 'm in a frantic rush as to what to do with her , " said @entity106 , who now uses @entity10 's services for @entity110			0
" when i see how she behaves even temporarily in a cage at the vet or groomer , i would not take her to a kennel			0
when i take her to someone else 's house , she 's totally excited			0
the fact i 'm leaving ? she could n't care less			0
" now he screens the potential hosts listed on @entity10 near where he lives to pick the best option for his wallet and comfort level			1
the company also has a bill of rights and a 24 - hour hotline ( " @entity138 " in the company 's terminology )			0
@entity21 offers a 100 % guarantee that includes insurance and emergency support			0
both sites try to screen hosts and customers but agree that host and customer alike must vet their counterpart and feel comfortable with the match			2
both sites recommend a meet - n - greet so dog owners and humans and dogs can meet and sniff out the temporary digs			2
" generally mass murderers and animal lovers do n't overlap , " said @entity22			0
" part of the phone interview process is making sure this person has truly devoted their life to animals			0
a lot of our hosts have long histories around animal rescue or trainers or work for shelters			2
they are known in community as animal lovers			0
" customers pay through the sites , which company officials said protects the customer in case of a negative experience			0
both sites also only allow customers who have paid for a host 's services to review that host , while @entity10 also allows testimonials from anyone who wants to recommend the host			0
@entity60 allows the hosts to review their canine guests as well			2
@entity10 also holds payment for three days after a home - stay has ended to allow the customer to make any complaints before payment is made			1
a pre-stay visit is a good idea , according to veterinarian @entity199 , because you can see if a dog - sitter keeps a clean house or has too many animals			0
owners also want to make sure the other dogs are current on their vaccinations			2
" you definitely want to take your dog 's own food with you because a change in food can cause a lot of gastrointestinal distress , " said @entity199 , a @entity207 , @entity208 , veterinarian			0
" make sure the dog sitter is knowledgeable about pets and has a fenced in yard that looks very safe			2
the main thing would be safety of the dog , not being able to escape and its exposure to other dogs			2
" " you 'd also want to have a backup vet available			0
i would actually call the vet and give permission for any major disasters			0
the vet hospital will ( usually ) write it down in your chart			0
" @entity10 , which collects 3 - 15 % of the charge depending on the host 's reviews and other factors , recently announced that it has raised $ 3.4 million from investors			1
@entity60 , which collects 3 - 10 % of the charge , just announced $ 1 million in funding and is on a @entity239 press tour this week to draw more attention to its @entity239 listings			2
