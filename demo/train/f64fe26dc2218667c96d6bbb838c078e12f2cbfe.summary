-- former model @entity1 sashayed down the catwalks and graced the covers of magazines around the world , until she decided to use her inside knowledge of the fashion industry to launch e-commerce platform @entity8			1
here the mother of three girls , who is also a @entity13 certified gemologist , shares her insights on the future of online shopping and talks about her transition from a model to a businesswoman			1
watch out for @entity1 at @entity20 , where she is @entity21 and @entity22 behind the scenes exclusively for @entity0			1
@entity0 : why did you switch career from being a model to a fashion writer and now entrepreneur ? @entity1 : i would n't say that i changed my career , but more that i took it to the next level			1
modeling has given me the opportunity to travel and learn about business from an early age , and that experience has helped me become an entrepreneur			1
it all started with a blog in 2009 where i put together various looks and photographed them , and then @entity42 gave me the opportunity to sell clothes through an affiliation system			2
it made me realize the potential online and @entity8 became a commercial platform			1
i also studied gemology to gain a deeper knowledge of exclusive markets , as at the time many fashion brands were launching their own jewelry lines			1
@entity0 : what have been the greatest challenges you 've faced in the transition ? @entity58 : as a model , people have preconceived ideas of you , and you have to fight them to gain credibility			1
but that can also be a good thing , because it pushes you to work harder and prove yourself more			2
you might need more time for people to take you seriously , but once you succeed you know that you 're fully prepared to operate on that level			0
@entity0 : what advice would you give to someone changing careers in the way you 've done ? @entity58 : think about what you have done in the past , and start something based on what you have experienced and learned			0
if you want to make a drastic career change , consider what your passion is			0
today , to be successful you must be professional , but also patient and persistent			0
you need to know what you are never willing to give up			0
ask yourself - if this job would n't pay anything , would i be able to do it every day for a long time ? if the answer is yes , then you have found your passion			0
@entity0 : how do you see consumer behavior changing over the next decade ? how will shopping be different ? @entity58 : the financial crisis has made people think more about the way they spend their money			2
they want to invest in lasting pieces which wo n't go out of fashion			2
i have always selected garments for my website according to that principle -- elegant clothes with a modern touch , which are wardrobe staples			0
@entity0 : do you think there will still be a role for high - street clothes shopping in the future ? @entity58 : i believe that we need both markets : virtual and physical			1
people shop online because it saves them time , they do n't have to worry about opening hours , or maybe they ca n't find what they are looking for in shops			0
it gives them a certain " shopping freedom " , but not everybody knows how things will fit them based on a picture from an e-boutique , no matter how detailed it may be			2
this is why at @entity8 we offer our clients services such as online personal shopping			1
@entity0 : how easy is it for new designers to find an audience these days compared to previous years ? @entity58 : i think it 's becoming harder and harder			0
so many designers are coming out of schools trying to launch their own brands , and it 's hard for them to stand out from the crowd			0
once they have found their brand identity it is n't over , they have to be able to keep it fresh and renew it for every collection - almost four times a year			0
this is why i am so impressed with designers that have been in fashion for decades , and have managed to reinvent themselves without losing what identifies them			2
@entity0 : has the @entity143 improved exposure for those who are up - and - coming ? @entity58 : of course ! internet is the best way to communicate , it offers easy access to up - and - coming designers , and social networks help them go beyond the constraints of a studio and show - off their work to a global audience			0
good or bad advertising , it does n't matter , as long as it spreads the news and people remember you and your work			0
@entity0 : how important are events like @entity20 for designers ? what opportunities are there after a good show ? @entity58 : fashion weeks are extremely important for designers			2
they are an opportunity to impress the most important people in the fashion media , whose reports will influence department store buyers and potential customers			1
a fashion show is not only about designing garments of clothing , it 's about inviting an audience into your world and showing your vision through a collection .			1
