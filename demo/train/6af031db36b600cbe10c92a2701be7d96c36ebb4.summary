-- @entity1 , the ceo of @entity2 , proudly proclaimed his opposition to marriage equality and drew flak from politicians and citizens nationwide , who said @entity9 's position made the chain unwelcome on their turf			1
some of the condemnation crossed the line , offending the @entity14			2
many do n't understand where the line is , and now a population already sharply divided over same - sex marriage is collectively less informed about the @entity14			1
the @entity14 protects you from government action suppressing your right to free speech			1
it does not protect you from private individuals ' negative reaction to your speech			2
as an extreme example : in my younger and more impulsive days , i punched out a guy who offended my then - girlfriend ( now wife )			2
he said he was exercising his first amendment rights			0
i agreed and told him that i would defend him if the government messed with him , but the @entity14 did n't protect him from a private punch			1
i broke a few laws that day , but i did n't violate the @entity14			1
similarly , the @entity14 does not protect you from criticism			2
@entity37 infamously took us all back a few steps by ignorantly criticizing the media for its negative commenting on her views			0
she said , " i do n't know what the future of our country would be in terms of first amendment rights and our ability to ask questions without fear of attacks by the mainstream media			2
" this statement is utterly wrong			0
the @entity14 does not protect you from scrutiny or criticism by the media or others			2
christian groups allege threats to religious freedom in @entity61 - a campaigns therefore , those claiming that the private calls to boycott @entity2 have any @entity14 implications are wrong			1
@entity9 put his thoughts into the marketplace of ideas , where they may be bought or rejected			0
he has no @entity14 right to our approval , or to our money for his sandwiches			2
but can cities use zoning to combat unpopular speech ? unfortunately , when we chip away at the @entity14 , unpleasant unintended consequences are not far behind			1
in @entity80 , the @entity79 allowed municipalities to use zoning to regulate strip clubs and adult bookstores to combat their " adverse secondary effects			0
" in other words , a city ca n't ban adult bookstores because it does n't like the books it sells			1
the city can effectively ban them by claiming it is doing so to prevent litter , traffic , lowered property values or other secondary effects it claims the business may cause ( and needs scant evidence to support the regulation )			0
over the years , courts expanded the doctrine to be virtually limitless			0
now a city need only mouth the words " adverse secondary effects " when enacting a regulation , and for the most part , courts will uphold it -- even though everyone knows the real reason is that the city does n't like the books and movies that the store sells			0
@entity114 : why i 'm celebrating @entity116 when municipalities are told for years they can make up zoning or other regulatory issues to make an end run around the @entity14 , is it any surprise that they would look to zoning obstacles to stop @entity2 from coming into town because they do n't like the ceo 's views on same - sex marriage ? some cities responded to @entity9 's statements with proper deference to the @entity14 , but others have not			1
@entity134 mayor @entity133 initially said , " if they need licenses in the city , it will be very difficult			0
... " after considering the issue , though -- and probably talking with his attorneys -- @entity133 acknowledged he did not have the power to block the chain from operating in @entity134			0
in contrast , @entity144 went further , saying he would work to block any @entity2 in his ward			1
@entity144 defended his view by saying , " you have the right to say what you want to say , but zoning is not a right			0
" he then took a page out of the " adverse secondary effects " doctrine playbook by saying he had concerns about increased traffic in the area			0
so far , @entity144 has not backed down			0
@entity2 wades into a fast - food fight over same - sex marriage rights these statements clearly raise @entity14 issues			1
a city ca n't deny permits because it disapproves of the owner 's exercise of his first amendment rights			1
both @entity133 and @entity144 were dead wrong even to claim they would do so			0
that crosses the line between simply speaking out and abusing government power			0
@entity133 's critics are right about his initial misuse of zoning law being a violation of the @entity14 , but after backing down on his threats , the mayor maintained he did not welcome @entity2 in @entity134			1
he was within his rights to do so -- expressing his own opinion , both personally and as mayor			0
in a letter to the chain , he wrote : " when @entity183 became the first state in the country to recognize equal marriage rights , i personally stood on @entity187 to greet same - sex couples coming here to be married , " he added			1
" it would be an insult to them and to our city 's long history of expanding freedom to have a @entity2 across the street from that spot			1
" as mayor of @entity134 , @entity133 has a @entity14 right , and perhaps even a duty , to express his views , as all political figures do			1
they have a position that gives them a platform to speak out , and be heard , on matters of public concern			0
@entity210 had a right to say that a mosque should n't be built in @entity213			0
a mayor in a less enlightened city has a right to say that @entity2 is especially welcome , just as he might want to say that @entity217 is not welcome because it gives benefits to same - sex couples			1
a city council member has a right to say that " my district does n't want an adult bookstore , " and @entity133 has a right to say that @entity134 does not welcome a business run by someone who is prejudiced			2
as long as they do not then try and give their views the force of law , they are within bounds			2
and if their constituents disagree with their views , then they use the political process to cure the problem			0
politicians ' rights , however , do not bleed over into using their official power to deny a business its fair due because of its , or its ceo 's , exercise of our cherished first amendment rights			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			2

@entity248 : dustup over @entity2 shows *confusion* over @entity14
after ceo 's remarks on same - sex marriage , some politicians said business unwelcome
@entity248 : politicians ca n't deny permits to block free speech but have other *recourse*
he says pols should have and express opinions but ca n't give them the force of law
