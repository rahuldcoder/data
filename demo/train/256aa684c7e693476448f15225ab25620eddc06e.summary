-- if you ever need motivation to slide off the couch and hit the gym , just think of @entity5			1
at 45 , the superstar swimmer has been training feverishly to make her sixth @entity8 swim team at @entity10 's @entity9			1
her event : the 50 - meter freestyle , which is one frenzied lap. the swimmer ( and model , tv sports commentator , author , and mother of 6 - year - old @entity18 , with ex-boyfriend @entity19 ) loves a challenge , but she 's had some tough ones thrown her way in the past few years			1
in 2009 , she underwent major knee surgery for arthritis and had to take off a year to recover			1
last year , her coach , @entity25 , whom she adored , died at 61 from a rare blood disorder			1
and she has found that her body -- as insanely fit as it is -- does n't bounce back from training as fast as it did a few years ago			1
so this time around , she 's shaking things up and taking a more scientific approach			1
in her adopted hometown of @entity31 , @entity32 , she 's assembled a team that includes a naturopathic doctor , a cook ( " because it 's just me and @entity18 , and she wants mac ' n ' cheese every night " ) , a nutritionist , and a pair of therapists who stretch her for two hours post-workout			1
recently , she even saw a specialist who analyzed her eye movements and prescribed exercises to improve her motion sickness			1
fun and games ? actually -- surprisingly -- yes			1
over a dinner of steak and yukon gold potatoes one night in the weeks leading up to the @entity61 , which start in late june ( if she comes in first or second , she goes to @entity10 ) , the funny , down - to - earth athlete talked about what she eats , how she got those killer abs , and what it 's like to share the pool with a bunch of 20 - year - olds			1
if you compete in @entity10 , you 'll be the oldest female @entity8 swimmer everâ € ” how do you feel about that ? you know what ? to me , it 's an honor			1
people say , " you must get sick of everyone talking about your age , " but it really does n't bother me			1
@entity0 : defy your age , inside and out so it does n't psych you out to be competing against people half your age ? not many things psych me out ! [ @entity79 ] i just try to have fun			2
i mean , i definitely have aches and pains that most middle - aged people have			2
what 's funny is that i listen to music before i swim a race and while i train			2
and i 'm surrounded by teenagers -- everything is hip - hop for them			2
so i 've really gotten into the hip - hop scene ! i 'll always have my classic rock -- the @entity92 , the @entity93 , the who -- but i 've made some other playlists with @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98			2
. how did changing your weight - training strategy in 2006 help improve your swimming ? my old school of training was the heavier you lift in the weight room , the stronger you 'll be in the water , but i felt like i was sinking because i had so much bulk on me			1
when my strength coach first came to see me , he said , " if you 're using every muscle in the pool , why should n't you use every muscle in the weight room ? " now my core is involved and the stuff i do really elongates my body , and i do n't feel so heavy in the water			2
@entity5 , the entire nation is obsessed with your abs. we want to know your secrets			1
ok , the first thing is genetics			2
my brother and i , our body types are exactly the same : ripped abs , big arms , skinny legs			2
and the second thing is my training			1
as far as ab sets , the most i do is maybe 30 reps , but there are always some kind of rotational movements using my core while i 'm working out			2
and i train extremely hard , so that 's why my abs are so strong -- i use my core in almost every exercise i do			2
@entity0 : @entity5 's moves for rock hard abs there 's so much pressure on you			1
how do you sleep the night before a big race ? it 's called @entity144			2
do you really ? oh , yeah			2
there are a lot of athletes who will take it if they need to fall asleep before they compete -- because you 're thinking about your race and you 're tossing and turning			2
i 'll take an @entity144 if i 'm having a really hard time going to sleep			0
but the next day is the @entity8 -- are n't you groggy ? no , i feel pretty good			1
it 's not like i 'm doing it all the time , but it definitely helps you to conk out			0
how do you deal with jitters in general ? any tricks ? i always feel sick to my stomach before i swim			0
but the minute i 'm on the block , everything is calm and i 'm ready to go			0
the way i look at it is , " i 've done everything i can at this point , i should just enjoy it			0
" that takes the pressure off			0
@entity0 : stressed ? 7 steps to instant calm let 's talk about food			0
how much wiggle room do you have for splurges ? women are going to hate hearing this , but i just have a really good metabolism			1
i used to take advantage of that and eat whatever i wanted			1
this is my last @entity8 and i need to give it 100 %			1
but i told myself that this summer -- when i 'm done training for good -- i 'm going to go back to drinking @entity183			1
even with a fabulous metabolism , do you ever have days where you feel fat ? oh yeah			1
and in my cycle , absolutely			0
i just got it a few days ago , and i was like " why is my stomach so bloated ? oh , hello			0
" other people may not see it , but i do			0
that 's the other thing that 's interesting -- working with a naturopathic doctor , i know that there are certain times in my cycle where my hormones are so low that if i train hard , it will take me forever to recover			1
so i actually have to let my nice 30 - something male coach know so he does n't train me hard during those times			0
you 've talked about battling bulimia during the early part of your career			0
any regrets about coming clean ? no. i wrote about it in my book because i wanted people to know me and not just , " i 'm first place			0
" i had such a fear of food for so long , but i finally got over it			0
what 's your biggest energy sapper ? probably being in the sun too much			0
i take my dog , @entity214 , to the beach on sundays , and i 'm in the sun every day anyway with my training			1
i never go outside before i 'm going to swim in a meet			0
@entity0 : 8 ways to instantly boost your energy you 're very competitive -- for you , second place is losing ! but what about outside the world of swimming ? are you the type that says , " lady , i 'm taking that parking space , " and jams on the gas ? constantly ! [ @entity79 ] it 's just in my makeup			0
it does n't matter if it 's in the pool or in a parking lot , i always have to be first -- it 's ridiculous			0
i have bets with friends all the time			0
i just have to win			0
i 'm hoping when i hang up my suit to dry this summer that it will go away			0
what 's motivating you this time ? why keep proving yourself ? i do n't think i have to prove anything anymore			0
it 's just the fact that i love challenges , and this is a huge one i 'm taking on -- much more so than four years ago			0
my coach and i had spoken about taking on this challenge before he passed away , and i want to finish what we talked about			0
@entity251 , the fact that so many people come up to me and say i inspire them really gets me going			0
i want to still give people hope that they can do the things that they thought , maybe , they could n't do			0
