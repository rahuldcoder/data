i despise almost everything i have ever heard him say			2
i wish that he were no longer on the air			0
that is why i write today to defend him against those who call for him to be silenced			0
far too frequently , @entity11 find offense in another 's art , music or other expression , and then they call for censorship			0
the @entity18 stands for principles like that espoused by the @entity21 in @entity22 v. @entity23 : " of there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation , it is that no official , high or petty , can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein			2
" or that wisdom given to us by @entity41 , " debate on public issues ... [ should be ] ... uninhibited , robust , and wide - open			2
" the @entity18 requires neither tact nor politeness			1
it requires that we permit all views to set up stalls in the marketplace of ideas , and we let that marketplace decide which ideas prevail			1
@entity2 has a right to his views			1
just as important , his fans have a right to hear him			0
those of us who disagree with him have a right to fight him , but we must do so on our own			0
using the government to support our view is constitutionally intolerable			0
trying to bully him off the air is wrong			0
some call for the @entity67 to pull @entity69 's broadcast licenses if they keep @entity2 on the air , because they believe that @entity2 does not " serve the public interest			1
" this is inaccurate and not permissible under the @entity73			0
it is a terrifying prospect that the government might review the political and social positions of a broadcaster when deciding who gets access to the airwaves			0
should the government censor books that it finds to be unpopular or offensive ? opinion : @entity67 should clear @entity2 from airwaves there is the argument that with a limited number of radio frequencies available , broadcasters should use them in the " public interest			1
" but how would these would - be censors expect the @entity67 to make that determination ? should there be a " politeness test ? " would this ban programming featuring @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 or @entity101 ? these would - be - censors want @entity2 off the air because he does not serve their interests			1
that does n't mean he does n't serve a " public interest			1
" there is no clearer " public interest " than the dissemination of political speech			1
@entity2 brings together millions of listeners who share his views			1
if that is not the " public interest , " then what is ? another way to get @entity2 off the air is to try and pressure his syndicator or his advertisers -- gathering people of like mind to use their collective economic power to force @entity2 off the air			1
this is constitutionally tolerable , but morally wrong			0
if you disagree with someone who is on stage , it is wrong to stand up and yell to drown out his voice			0
this improperly interferes with your fellow citizens ' right to receive information			0
@entity2 's audience has a right to hear him			1
drowning out his voice by organized bullying is no way to pay tribute to our most cherished liberty			0
it may be your right to do so , but it does n't make it the right thing to do			0
should the marketplace of ideas lose a stall because someone in it said some " naughty words ? " justice @entity151 wrote : " when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out			2
that at any rate is the theory of our @entity73			0
" the challenge in this view is that it requires hard work on the part of those who wish to beat @entity2			1
it requires us to place our ideas into competition with @entity2 's			1
i despise @entity2 not because he uttered one or two nasty words , but because his views are truly evil			2
i debate those who agree with him			0
i place my ideas into the marketplace , and i believe that ideas like mine will win out			2
i realize that my work is difficult , and i may not even live to see @entity2 's ideas repudiated			1
but my commitment to free expression requires me to engage his ideas , to parry them and to let my beliefs stand on their own -- without using the government or other improper means to tip the scales			2
free speech means tolerating views that you despise			0
otherwise , one day , it will be your views that someone does n't like			2
if you do n't stand up for @entity2 's liberty today , someone may come for yours tomorrow			1
discredit him , but do n't silence him			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211			2

@entity213 says he ca n't stand @entity2 but will defend his right to be heard
he says the @entity18 does n't require politeness ; it requires right to express ideas
he says @entity2 draws millions to hear his views . that 's not " in the public interest ? "
@entity211 : debate @entity2 in the marketplace of ideas ; discredit him , do n't silence him
