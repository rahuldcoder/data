-- on this week 's @entity5 podcast , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 discuss some pretty big advances in car technology that could be just a few years away from becoming a reality			1
@entity9 has endorsed what 's called vehicle - to - vehicle communication technology			1
the tech , which is being tested now , lets automobiles , in effect , talk to each other -- for safety and other reasons			2
there 's also growing talk that cars that drive themselves could be closer than we think			2
in other news we talk about a billboard in @entity25 that shows you a different ad based on your gender			0
it uses facial recognition to decide ( supposedly with 90 percent accuracy ) whether you 're a man or woman and respond accordingly			0
we talk about what this might mean for the future of advertising			0
our @entity39 come from our stories this week about internet privacy -- most notably concerns by lawmakers and state attorneys about @entity45 's upcoming changes to its privacy policy			1
@entity45 says it will be pulling all of your data from all its sites and tools into a single profile			1
and our @entity52 goes to some folks who we feel are taking @entity54 -- a pretty fun app to play with that attempts to measure your online influence -- a little too seriously			0
