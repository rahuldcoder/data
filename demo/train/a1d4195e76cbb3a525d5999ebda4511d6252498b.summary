@entity0 , @entity1 -- for the past decade , @entity3 has been home to the greatest concentration of cranes anywhere in the world as billions of tonnes of concrete , steel and glass have refashioned the city skyline			1
but the rapid growth of the past six years has slowed recently due to the global slump in property prices			1
hopes of a recovery have now been further imperiled by the news that the state - owned @entity19 has requested to delay paying its massive debts by six months			1
@entity3 has become a playground for architects as well as millionaires commissioning a string of audacious building projects aimed at helping reposition the city as the financial and cultural hub of the @entity29			1
billions of dollars have been spent transforming the landscape , erecting buildings which continue to break records of all dimensions			0
the @entity3 -- at 818 meter the world 's tallest skyscraper , the vast @entity34 -- built on land reclaimed from the sea , the @entity39 -- the largest shopping center in the world and the @entity42 ; home to the world 's biggest indoor ski slope form part of a very long list of completed construction projects			1
" the whole place is kind of like a time - lapse film			0
you wake up in the morning and it 's just a little bit different , " @entity53 , author of " @entity54 : @entity3 and the @entity55 " told @entity2			1
but , according to @entity53 , some of these projects , like the @entity3 , suffer from a severe lack of practicality			1
" @entity3 does n't really need to have to build tall asides from prestige purposes			1
if you look at it , it 's a really bad idea			0
it uses as much electricity as an entire city			0
and every time the toilet is flushed they 've got to pump water half a mile into the sky , " he said the telescopic shape is also presents problems of a more practical nature @entity53 thinks			2
" the upper 30 or 40 floors are so tiny that they 're useless , so they ca n't use them for anything else apart from storage			0
they 've built a small , not so useful storage warehouse half a mile in the sky , " he said			0
this prestige over practicality issue something of a recurring theme in @entity3 's banner building projects			1
@entity53 , who lived and worked in @entity3 from 2005 to 2007 , also called into questions the attraction of the @entity88			1
the $ 12 billion @entity34 -- populated with valuable villas and hotels -- could have been a lot better he says			0
" it 's not been very well done			0
you ca n't even see the sea and all the fronds which house the communities are gated			0
" its sister islands the @entity97 -- which developers say will be the size of @entity100 housing 1.5 million residents -- has yet to be completed			0
@entity53 hopes it never is			2
" it 's on the @entity106 border [ one of the six other emirates ] and is the most densely populated part of the city			0
there 's no infrastructure at all over there for and extra 1.5 million residents " and despite the best efforts of the property companies the @entity88 have still harmed the area 's marine environment			0
the environmental damage is n't limited to the coastline according to @entity53			2
the huge boulders helping lay the foundations for coastal reclamation projects like @entity125 project -- which developers boast will be twice the size of @entity128 -- are , he says , slowly laying waste to some of the @entity133 's more picturesque mountain regions			2
but with the renewed financial uncertainty @entity3 's ambitions are likely to be reigned in			1
in 2008 , it was announced that the new @entity138 hotel in @entity3 would have a beach which featured refrigerated sand			2
at the moment the only people getting cold feet are the people looking to invest in @entity3			2
and while that situation continues , many of @entity3 's construction projects will remain on ice .			1

@entity3 's construction boom has slowed in recent months due to *economic* *slowdown*
new financial concerns over @entity19 debt *repayments* add to uncertainty
former @entity3 resident @entity53 questions the *wisdom* of some construction projects
