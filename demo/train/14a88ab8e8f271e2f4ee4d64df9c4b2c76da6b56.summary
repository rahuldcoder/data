-- @entity1 defied the odds to win her first major trophy at the 65th @entity5 women 's open on sunday after recovering from a career - threatening thumb injury			1
the 23 - year - old @entity5 thought she would never play golf again after aggravating her injured left thumb while playing in the season - ending @entity9 in @entity10 last year			1
the win at @entity12 is even more impressive given that @entity1 had surgery as recently as march and had to play through the pain in her thumb during the final day , when she played 23 holes due to earlier rain delays			1
" you do n't have surgery on your thumb and win a championship , " she told reporters , quoted on the @entity20 website			2
" i do n't think the odds are very good after that			0
" i had my surgery , and yes , there was a time before my surgery where i thought , ' oh , my gosh , i may never play golf again ' or , you know , if the surgery goes wrong			2
" but it was what i had to do , and here we are with a @entity5 open championship next to me			1
so it 's been pretty cool			2
" @entity1 , who had previously won eight @entity39 titles , went into her fourth tournament since the surgery far from 100 percent fit			1
the @entity43 , who is limited to hitting mostly shots off a tee in practice , said her win shows how important the mental side is to the sport			0
" i do n't even think i 'm 80 percent [ fit ] , " she said			2
" jeez , i 've said this whole time i think i 'm about 60			0
" it just shows , you know , how much the mental side of golf can really take over			0
you know , i believed i could do this			0
i believed i could do this when i had a cast on my hand			0
" that 's what i just kept thinking about was @entity61 , @entity61 , @entity61			0
" @entity1 , nicknamed the " @entity69 " because of her fondness for wearing the color , beat joint second - placed @entity64 of @entity65 ( 66 ) and @entity67 's @entity66 ( 69 ) by four strokes			1
she completed her rain - delayed third round of 70 before carding a closing 69 , at three - under for the tournament making her the only player to break par. she was in tears after watching her final putt sink in the hole to end years of questions from the media as to whether the former teenage amateur star would ever win a major tournament			1
@entity1 became the first @entity5 to win the @entity82 since @entity83 in 2007 and the second after @entity86 's 2004 triumph			1
" it 's incredible , it really is , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's been amazing			0
" i 've always thought of my career as i 've always been a pretty solid player , but yes , that question always lurked : how come you never won a major ? " and now we have , and we never get to get asked that question again ! "			0
