@entity0 -- forget @entity3 's predictions			2
the words " play ball ! " are the most dependable sign that spring has arrived in @entity7			1
finally , baseball season is here			1
maybe because it is an outdoor game , with a schedule stretching across three seasons			2
maybe because it is a child 's game played by men , bridging the different times of our lives			2
but the start of the baseball season is always greeted with relief , a sign of rebirth and hope , that this year appropriately coincides with @entity24			1
the bleak time has been survived			2
and slowly but soon the familiar rhythms of life will reassert themselves			2
this , as it 's referred to in the film " @entity31 , " is the church of baseball , open to all			1
it is a sport more appropriately known as a pastime , " the national pastime			2
" the pace of the game is part of its charm -- meditation and strategy interspersed with furious action			0
the sounds of the game are the background track to summer			0
as a sport played without a clock , a baseball game occurs out of time			1
it could theoretically go on forever			0
the past is always present in baseball -- it is " a haunted game , " as @entity58 ' documentary " baseball " intones , with typically perfect pitch			1
the best players of today compete not just with the players in their league , but the best players of all time			0
statistics are the unlikely portal to this bit of metaphysics			0
fans can compare players of different eras and dream up their own all - time all - star team			0
this is another reason to love the game : @entity56 can inspire young fans to see the fun in math and history			0
i am a @entity80 fan , first minted in 1979 , looking up at a poster of @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 -- meaning that i waited 17 years to see them return to @entity87 - winning form			1
it was a case of bad timing : i stayed true when just about everyone my age in @entity0 was rooting for the @entity92 in their championship 1986 season			1
this takes not quite as much character as remaining a @entity98 fan , but it 's somewhere in the same ballpark			0
now with the yankee players of the legendary late 1990s teams reaching the twilight of their careers , i am not expecting to win our division this year , let alone see the @entity87			1
but with the start of the new season , a blank slate in front of us , the possibility exists , and that in itself is liberating			1
as much as i love the @entity80 , i love the game of baseball more			1
which is why i always harbor a secret hope on opening day that the long - suffering @entity98 fans will finally get to see a @entity87 win in their antique jewel of a ballpark , @entity120			0
i want to see baseball tradition and fan faith rewarded			1
even when the @entity80 ' archrivals , the @entity123 , won their 2004 @entity87 after 86 years of waiting , i quietly cheered , because @entity126 fans had waited long enough and deserved some deliverance			0
the love of the game comes first			0
these are a fan 's notes before opening day , a rambling love letter to a game that still surprises me with how much i miss it in the offseason			0
none of these thoughts or emotions is entirely original , but they are from the heart			0
the church of baseball has many hymns , from @entity58 ' epic " @entity56 , " to films like " @entity146 " and " @entity147 , " to books like " @entity149			1
" sports columnists like @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 captured enduring moments in the newspapers of their day			0
but the finest tribute , to my eyes and ears , came from the typewriter of @entity160 , the one - time president of @entity162 and @entity123 fan , who died of a heart attack at the age of 51 , just 154 days into his tenure as the commissioner of baseball : " it is designed to break your heart , " he wrote			1
" the game begins in the spring , when everything else begins again , and it blossoms in the summer , filling the afternoons and evenings , and then as soon as the chill rains come , it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone			1
" but this is the beginning of the season			2
the knowledge that " this too will pass " takes away none of the thrill that comes with new beginnings			0
there are green outfields and long summer days ahead of us			0
the story of this season is about to be written and we will all get to be witnesses			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

the start of the baseball season coincides with @entity24 this year
@entity191 says the church of baseball is open to all
