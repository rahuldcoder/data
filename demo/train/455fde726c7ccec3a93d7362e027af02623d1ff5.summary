@entity0 spent two hours killing death row inmate @entity1 this week , an unusually long time for an execution			1
@entity1 's death has reopened the debate about capital punishment and lethal injection			1
lethal injection is used in all 32 states that have the death penalty			1
some witnesses said @entity1 was gasping for breath and seemed to be in pain			2
others said he was simply snoring			2
the state of @entity0 said @entity1 did n't suffer			1
either way , there are renewed concerns that executions , which are supposed to be quick and painless , are neither			1
typically executions are performed using three drugs in stages			2
the first drug is an anesthetic			2
the second drug is called a paralytic and the third drug is supposed to stop the heart			2
for years , executioners used a drug called sodium thiopental as the first drug , the anesthetic , until the only @entity33 producer of the drug stopped making it			2
then the @entity33 turned to @entity37 manufacturers , but they refused to sell the drug for use in executions			2
since sodium thiopental was taken off the market for executions , states have turned to a drug called midazolam for the anesthetic			0
but experts believe there have been problems with the drug in at least three executions			0
the problems described by witnesses included gasping , snorting or choking sounds and , in one execution , the inmate was described as speaking			1
@entity1 was injected with midazolam on wednesday , as well as hydromorphone , a narcotic painkiller that , with an overdose , halts breathing and stops the heart from beating			0
it is one of the new combinations that states have tried , with some controversial results			0
what would qualify as a botched execution ? @entity70 , a professor of sociology and law , said an execution is botched when it looks like the inmate endured " prolonged suffering " for 20 minutes or more			1
whether they 're " botched " or not , plenty of executions do n't go by the book			0
most of the executions listed here were compiled by @entity82			0
@entity83 , executed january 16 , 2014 , in @entity84			0
@entity86 reporter @entity85 said the execution process took 24 minutes , and that @entity88 appeared to be gasping for air for 10 to 13 minutes			1
he had been injected with midazolam and hydromorphone , a two - drug combination that had n't been used before in the @entity33			0
@entity88 , 53 , was convicted in 1994 in the rape and murder of a 22 - year - old pregnant woman			0
@entity96 , executed april 29 , 2014 , in @entity97			0
@entity96 was injected with midazolam , but instead of becoming unconscious , he twitched , convulsed and spoke			0
the execution was halted , but @entity96 died after 43 minutes			1
a team that prepared @entity96 for execution failed to set a properly functioning iv in his leg , according to preliminary findings of an independent autopsy			1
@entity96 was convicted in the 1999 death of an @entity97 woman who was buried alive after she was raped and shot			1
@entity108 , executed november 7 , 2001 , in @entity109			0
this execution illustrates a common problem			2
the execution team had trouble finding a usable vein and spent 39 minutes looking before finally sticking a needle into @entity108 's hand			1
a second needle was inserted between his neck and shoulder by a physician			0
sixty - nine minutes after the execution began , he was pronounced dead			1
@entity108 was convicted in a 1976 store robbery and the kidnapping and murder of an 11 - year - old boy			0
@entity128 , executed december 7 , 2000 , in @entity129			0
the execution team spent 30 minutes looking for a suitable vein , a difficult task because of @entity128 ' history of drug abuse			1
he was convicted in the 1990 murder of a liquor store owner			0
@entity138 , executed april 23 , 1998 , in @entity129			0
the needle popped out and @entity138 said to witnesses , " it 's come undone			2
" the needle was reinserted and 15 minutes later a weeping @entity138 made his second final statement			2
he was convicted of murder			0
@entity145 , executed may 10 , 1994 , in @entity146			1
lethal chemicals solidified and clogged in the iv tube leading to @entity145 's arm			1
a new tube was installed and the execution proceeded			1
@entity145 , one of @entity33 's most notorious killers , was convicted in 1980 of raping and killing 33 boys and young men he lured into his home			1
@entity157 , executed september 12 , 1990 , in @entity146			0
the execution was prolonged because a kink in the plastic tubing stopped the flow of chemicals into @entity157 's body and an intravenous needle pointed at @entity157 's fingers , instead of his heart , said a @entity168 engineer hired to assist in the execution			1
@entity157 was convicted of two counts of murder			0
@entity172 , executed december 13 , 1988 , in @entity129			0
the catheter dislodged and flew through the air two minutes after injection of drugs into @entity172 's body			1
the execution team spent 14 minutes inserting it again and @entity172 was pronounced dead 40 minutes after being strapped to the gurney			1
he had been convicted of murder .			0
