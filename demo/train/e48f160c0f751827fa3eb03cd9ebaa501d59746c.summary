residents of three villages in northeastern @entity4 took security into their own hands this week , repelling attacks by @entity9 insurgents and killing more than 200 of them , residents and officials said			1
hundreds of @entity9 fighters stormed the villages of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 in the ethnic @entity16 - dominated @entity15 on tuesday			1
@entity9 -- the group responsible for the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls from the same region -- was met with stiff resistance as locals put up a fierce fight , witnesses said			1
a month has passed since the girls were kidnapped , and the @entity4 government has been accused of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect villages in the region threatened by @entity9			1
in the three villages attacked tuesday , gunmen arrived in dozens of all - terrain vans , armored tanks and motorcycles , but villagers quickly mobilized and engaged the attackers in a prolonged battle			1
" they attacked @entity12 and killed around 60 people and burned some homes before proceeding to @entity13 and @entity14 villages , " resident @entity36 said			2
when news of the attack filtered out , people trooped out from nearby villages carrying arms			0
locals seized an armored tank , three all - terrain vans and 90 motorcycles from the attackers , residents said			2
" at @entity13 and @entity14 , they met a big surprise as residents engaged them in a fierce battle in which over 200 of the @entity9 fighters were killed			1
more than 150 were killed in @entity13 , " @entity36 said			0
a lawmaker in @entity57 's @entity56 confirmed the incident			0
" i received information on the gallant action taken by the people in @entity15 in which at least 200 @entity9 gunmen were killed , " said the lawmaker , who asked not to be named for security reasons			1
a relief worker in the area said he counted more than 100 bodies in @entity13 alone			0
" i believe the number of the gunmen killed is up to 250 , " said the worker , who also asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from @entity9			1
it was the second defeat @entity9 has suffered from locals in the area in over a month			2
scores of @entity9 gunmen were killed by villagers in early april in a foiled raid , residents said			1
20 soldiers killed in ambushes the director general of the @entity84 , which acts as a communications arm of the government , commended the villagers ' actions , but defended the military			2
" the vigilante is a common phenomenon in @entity4 -- it is not a new development , " @entity90 said			2
" they were able to do what they did because they had prior information that these people were coming to attack them at a particular time in the night and particular time of the day			0
" @entity90 said he did not know how the villagers would have received that key information			0
" the military can not be in every village at the same time -- like i said for emphasis , if the military had not been on the ground sufficiently , perhaps the entire northeast would have been overrun by now			0
or the entire country would have been overrun , " he said			0
meanwhile , the military was having problems among its ranks after 20 soldiers were killed in two separate ambushes on wednesday			2
one of those ambushes happened after troops left @entity119 , the village from which the girls were kidnapped			0
according to military sources , @entity4 soldiers upset over the deaths of their colleagues opened fire on a convoy carrying a military commander			1
the commander escaped unhurt , the military sources said			0
" soldiers have been angry with the poor treatment they receive from their superiors in terms of inadequate arms and poor allowances in their combat against @entity9 , " a military source said			1
" the death of their colleagues was too much for them to bear			0
" the @entity4 defense spokesman , maj. gen. @entity141 , downplayed the incident as " an internal issue that has been sorted out			2
" families , friends identify girls in video @entity119 is located in a remote part of northern @entity4			1
many people there do not have access to television			0
those who do have held viewing sessions at their homes to watch a @entity9 video , released monday by @entity155 , a @entity156 news agency			1
parents crowded around the screens , searching for any sign of their missing daughters			0
the governor of @entity57 , @entity161 , also arranged special viewings for some families and girls who escaped the clutches of @entity9			1
a spokesman for the @entity57 governor said parents , students and teachers have so far identified 77 of the girls in the video , which shows about 100 girls , not the full 276 abducted from @entity119			1
some relatives interviewed by @entity175 -- an uncle of one of the girls who escaped and the parents of two missing girls -- said they believe the video also shows some girls abducted as long as two years ago			1
the confusion is significant because the video had been hailed as proof that at least some girls in the @entity119 abduction -- the object of international search efforts -- were alive and well			2
such proof would be a crucial part of any possible negotiations that could lead to the release of the girls			0
" i think we 've got to be realistic , " @entity175 analyst @entity193 told @entity175 's " @entity195 " this week			0
" even in a negotiation , because of the large number of captives , you are unlikely to return all approximately 300 girls to their families and reunite them healthy , safe and well			0
