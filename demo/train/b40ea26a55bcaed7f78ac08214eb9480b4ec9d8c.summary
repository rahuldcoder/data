-- have you ever put on a full - body wetsuit ? it takes some time			1
lots of pulling , tugging and wriggling around to get it in the perfect position			1
in early june , i raced my first triathlon relay , completing the swim and run portions			1
it took three people -- my mom , my sister and my relay partner -- to help me get into my wetsuit			1
i joked that day that it " takes a village to get me in my wetsuit			2
" as with any joke , there is a kernel of truth in that statement			2
upon hearing that i had been selected for the @entity25 team , i immediately began to imagine what the upcoming months of training would hold			1
i envisioned myself running , biking , swimming and eating super-nutritious meals			1
in all of these scenarios , i was alone			2
after all , triathlon is not a team sport , right ? wrong			2
it takes a village to train for a triathlon , and i have an amazing tribe by my side ! reflecting on the sheer quantity , not to mention impeccable quality , of folks who are sharing this journey with me brings tears of gratitude to my eyes			2
sometimes you just have to lose control my relationship with my husband , @entity49 , has deepened through shared bike rides , running sessions and healthy meal planning			1
my 7 - year old - daughter , @entity54 , cheers me on at races , does squats and sit - ups with me and tells strangers her mommy is strong ( and famous ) ! my local mentors , @entity61 and @entity62 , were strangers at this time last year			1
now i ca n't imagine my life without them			2
@entity61 has generously offered invaluable advice from his more than 30 years of racing experience			2
@entity62 is my constant training buddy			1
we meet up for runs , rides and races , and she pushes me to get outside my comfort zone			1
professional triathlete and @entity75 world champ @entity74 has become my friend and mentor			2
at her invitation , i participated in her extraordinary training boot camp			1
more important , i attended a talk @entity81 gave about her journey to @entity83 , in which she was brutally honest about her failures as well as her successes			0
hearing an athlete at her level speak so openly of her struggles empowered me to take more risks , in triathlon and in other areas of my life			0
i met local coaches @entity95 and @entity96 at my second triathlon relay			1
they offered to help me with my swim form through weekly clinics they hold at my local @entity101			0
their expertise and encouragement is taking my swim fitness to the next level			0
work out what matters most : your mind @entity110 , owner of a local boutique gym , has welcomed me with open arms			0
i strength train there three times a week with trainer @entity116			1
@entity116 's enthusiasm for my triathlon challenge is undeniable			0
she spends time researching new exercises geared toward triathletes to maximize my gym time			0
@entity110 and @entity116 are not only helping me build muscle ; they are helping me build confidence			0
i 've rekindled old friendships and moved existing friendships forward			0
instead of meeting for dinner and drinks , i bike with my friend @entity131 and go to spin class with my pal @entity133			0
while on vacation in @entity135 in april , i met up with my former colleague @entity136 for a run			0
i 'm currently making plans for a long bike ride with @entity140 , a friend from primary school			0
you can build your own village			0
tell friends about your goals and invite them to training sessions			1
talk to strangers at the gym , on the track , on the trail and at your race			0
introduce yourself , ask them about their training goals , and surround yourself with friends and supporters who help move you forward			1
as you gain experience , share your knowledge with new athletes			0
so what 's stopping you ? take the first step and tell the world you are ready to tri			0
you 'll be amazed at how quickly your village will grow			0
follow @entity165 on @entity166 @ @entity167			1

when she *joined* @entity25 , @entity169 imagined running , biking , swimming alone
now , @entity165 runs and bikes with her husband , does strength training with her daughter
she also has several coaches and mentors who have helped her along the way
