-- between the presidential candidates and congressional races , at least $ 4.2 billion may have been spent on an election that ultimately ended up preserving the status quo in @entity5			1
voters elected the same president and the same political parties -- the @entity9 in the @entity10 and the @entity11 in the @entity12 -- will run @entity13			1
did all that record spending really matter ? at the presidential level , maybe not so much			2
partial totals of what was spent so far show that between the candidate , his party and well - heeled outside groups , the " @entity21 " spent more money on the effort to elect @entity9 @entity25 than the " @entity26 " did to re-elect president @entity27 , according to an analysis by the @entity29 , a nonpartisan group that monitors the influence of money on politics			1
combined , the candidate , the national party , and outside spending groups , like conservative issue - oriented nonprofits and super pacs , had spent more than $ 1 billion on @entity25 's effort			1
the liberal version of that combination of groups spent about $ 96 million less on the @entity27 re-election			1
that number will change once the final accounting is completed			2
there was a ton of last - minute spending on attack ads and get - out - the - vote efforts			0
however , the @entity27 campaign raised almost twice as much as the @entity25 camp			1
business group blows $ 29 million on election losers " i 'd be surprised if he left anything in the bank , " said @entity55 , editorial director at the @entity56 , a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for greater government transparency			1
no matter who spent more , @entity61 worries that the amount of money involved in this election will dramatically change politics			1
" i think the most worrisome thing is that this is the first billion dollar - plus presidential campaign , so what this means is this amount will become the benchmark , " @entity61 said			1
" if you want to be a serious contender in the future , you will have to have those kind of resources and it gives an outsized role then to the outside groups who are able to raise unlimited funds			0
" difference seen in congressional races @entity61 believes money may have made the most difference in congressional races			2
it seemed to have played a particularly big role when interests outside of a candidate 's state got involved			0
the @entity29 estimates that outside groups spent some $ 1.3 billion and counting on the election			1
in 2008 , they only spent $ 262.7 million			1
the difference this time was mainly due to a landmark court ruling two years ago that effectively permitted a sharp increase in outside spending , especially by corporations and unions			0
" at the presidential level , candidates are able to raise enough money to get their message out and drive their own narrative , " @entity61 said			0
" down the ballot though , where you 've got outside groups dumping $ 500,000 into a race and the opposition does n't have the cash on hand to compete , that could make a real difference			2
" in a @entity0 analysis of spending in a dozen key @entity12 races , most of the candidates who won spent the most money			1
one @entity12 race that saw record amounts of outside money was in @entity124			1
senator @entity125 , a @entity126 who had held his seat since 1989 , decided to retire this year			0
both candidates who ran for his seat had strong name recognition in @entity124			0
@entity130 defends campaign spending to donors democrat @entity133 served seven terms in the @entity135			2
she is well known nationally as the first publicly - out lesbian to be elected to federal office			0
her @entity9 opponent , @entity138 , was a popular @entity124 governor before becoming health secretary in the administration of @entity141			0
after winning a bruising @entity9 primary , @entity138 was seen as an early favorite -- partly because @entity124 has recently leaned much more ' red			0
' in august , @entity138 had a nine - point lead in the polls , but @entity133 had fully turned the tables by the end of september			0
@entity138 rallied and by @entity149 , the race was too close to call			0
the primary had left @entity138 cash poor while @entity133 was able to outpace him in fundraising			0
she spent virtually all of it -- $ 11.6 million -- as of the october reporting deadline			1
@entity138 raised $ 7.36 million and spent $ 6.04 million , according to the @entity29			1
outside groups , super pacs spent more outside groups spent even more on the race than did the campaigns			2
@entity162 and special interest groups spent some $ 18.9 million on efforts opposing @entity138 and only $ 2.6 million in support of him			1
the groups spent $ 15.5 million against @entity133 , $ 1.2 million for her			1
the biggest outside group that tried to hurt @entity133 's chances created a slew of negative ads. in them , @entity9 operative @entity173 's group , @entity172 , called @entity133 a " rubber stamp " for the president , who was " too extreme " for the state			0
@entity172 spent more than $ 6 million on this race , but lost			1
" you have to keep in mind though candidates do n't win elections just because they spend more , " @entity61 said			0
" a win is also based on how effectively a candidate spends their money and on just how effective a campaigner the candidate is			0
" analysis : it 's never too early to talk about 2016 in the @entity12 race in @entity194 , for instance , @entity9 @entity191 outspent @entity11 opponent @entity195 by about $ 7 million			1
@entity191 ran a strong race , but took a hit in the polls when , at a debate , he made a controversial remark about rape and abortion			0
in @entity124 , @entity138 's campaign also hit a few bumps along the way			2
a low point may have been when @entity138 's son told an audience , " we have the opportunity to send president @entity27 back to @entity212 , or @entity213			1
" he later apologized for the remarks			0
while the race remained tight throughout election night , @entity133 defeated @entity138 51 % to 46 %			2
@entity133 will become the first female senator to represent @entity124 and the nation 's first openly gay person to win a @entity12 seat			2
" i did n't run to make history , " @entity133 said in her acceptance speech			0
" i ran to make a difference			0
" it looks like the money she spent on the race may have made a difference , too .			2
