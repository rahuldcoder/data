@entity1 gov. @entity0 halted all executions in his state friday , citing the state 's " error prone " justice system and " inherent biases " among his reasons for the moratorium			1
" i take this action only after significant consideration and reflection , " @entity0 said friday			1
" there is perhaps no more weighty a responsibility assigned to the governor than his or her role as the final check in the capital punishment process			1
" @entity0 , a @entity20 who ran his family 's cabinet manufacturing business before becoming governor in january , said the moratorium would be in place until a task force examining capital punishment in @entity1 issues its final report			1
" if the @entity31 of @entity1 is going to take the irrevocable step of executing a human being , its capital sentencing system must be infallible , " he said			1
" @entity1 's system is riddled with flaws , making it error prone , expensive and anything but infallible			1
" it is a flawed system steeped in bigotry , according to @entity0			1
" numerous recent studies have called into question the accuracy and fundamental fairness of @entity1 's capital sentencing system , " he said			1
" these studies suggest that inherent biases affect the makeup of death row			0
while data is incomplete , there are strong indications that a person is more likely to be charged with a capital offense and sentenced to death if he is poor or of a minority racial group , and particularly where the victim of the crime was @entity57			0
" the governor stressed that the impetus was to re-examine a flawed system of justice , and in no way a sentence commutation for the 186 individuals on @entity1 's death row			2
" this moratorium is in no way an expression of sympathy for the guilty on death row , all of whom have been convicted of committing heinous crimes , " @entity0 said			2
" this decision is based on a flawed system that has been proven to be an endless cycle of court proceedings as well as ineffective , unjust and expensive			0
" according to the @entity79 , @entity1 has executed three inmates since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 , the last being in 1999			0
@entity0 's action friday has the most immediate effect on @entity85 , a convicted killer who was scheduled to die march 4			2
a district attorney who is prosecuting a man charged with killing a state trooper decried @entity0 's move as " unilateral and potentially unlawful			2
" @entity92 district attorney @entity91 's office last month said it would seek the death penalty in the case of @entity95 , accused of killing cpl. @entity96 and injuring trooper @entity97 in a september ambush outside a state police barracks in @entity100 , @entity1			2
@entity91 said @entity0 's move " does not serve as any legal impediment to my office 's pursuit of justice " in the case against @entity95 , charged with first - degree murder , terrorism and other counts			0
" in announcing his action , the governor has usurped the authority of the legislature and courts in setting the lawful punishment for convicted killers			0
this unilateral action will only cause more pain and confusion to families who have suffered the actions of the worst criminals , " @entity91 said			0
@entity95 , who was arrested in october after a nearly seven - week manhunt , pleaded not guilty last month			0
@entity2 's @entity123 contributed to this report .			0
