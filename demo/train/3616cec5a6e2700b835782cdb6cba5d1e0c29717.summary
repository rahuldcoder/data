-- the current chaos in @entity2 is tragic in almost every way			2
in retrospect , it is easy to conclude @entity2 was not nearly ready enough to assume control of its own security situation when the @entity9 made the decision to withdraw forces in december 2011			1
the wisdom of that decision will long be debated , but having made it , the @entity9 is now understandably reluctant to undo it			2
even as the @entity19 administration sorts through a galaxy of unattractive options , none of which is guaranteed to provide stability , it would be well - advised not to overlook one of the biggest strategic lessons of the @entity2 deterioration			2
that would be the warning signal it provides for another country headed down the same disturbing path : @entity31			2
while @entity2 and @entity31 are of course vastly different in terms of demographics , history and terrain , the parallels emerging between them in terms of security implications and political process are too important to ignore			1
an extremist militant group rising quickly and taking over large swaths of the country			0
a government focusing more on retribution and vengeance than reconciliation and governance			0
and a supposedly well - trained army essentially disintegrating in the face of real conflict			0
all of these characteristics describe the situation in @entity2 , but all may be equally descriptive of @entity31 in only a few short years			1
similar to @entity2 , @entity31 has an ethnic , well - organized and well - funded insurgent group poised to retake significant amounts of territory once @entity9 troops leave			1
there can be no doubt that the @entity62 , having seized power once before in @entity61 , is only biding its time until it can do so again			0
much like the @entity63 in @entity2 and @entity64 , the @entity62 takes advantage of the limits of federal influence and governs by fear and aggression			1
it is only a matter of time before the @entity62 , newly emboldened by the recent prisoner swap that freed five militants , takes control of southern @entity31 and challenges @entity61 's authority			1
compounding this situation is the shaky and corrupted political process under way , which makes @entity2 look like a well - functioning democracy			0
in a variation of @entity2 prime minister @entity83 's sectarian tendencies , outgoing @entity31 president @entity80 has done little to unite @entity31 's many tribal factions during his 12 years in office , instead often fomenting discontent			1
while both of the leading presidential candidates have pledged to focus on unity , there is little reason to believe that either will make it a priority			0
ominously , one candidate has already boycotted the electoral process before the results of the june 14 run - off election even being announced			0
as a result , @entity31 could become even more politically divided than @entity2 is today			1
perhaps the biggest wild card in @entity31 's future is the @entity100			1
much like the @entity2 army , the @entity31 army will be charged with maintaining the security situation once the @entity9 departs			1
and much like the @entity2 , the @entity31 have been trained by the @entity9			1
as we heard in @entity2 , the training of the @entity31 will be sufficient preparation to defend the country from any threats that may arise			1
while the @entity31 may be courageous soldiers , there have been numerous reports of lackluster performances			0
so much so that their abilities in actual combat situations remain uncertain			0
in addition , @entity31 has never had a real national fighting force , meaning there are few examples and fewer role models for current soldiers to emulate			0
as a national army , the @entity31 came from a much less mature and much less professional starting point than the @entity2			1
as illustrated in @entity2 , without the right training and leadership , soldiers may not be willing to defend against insurgents , despite an enormous numerical advantage			0
given all this , it is not difficult to look at the situation in @entity2 and see @entity31 's future			1
indeed , with a resurgent @entity62 , political instability in @entity61 , an untested army and if the @entity9 continues with its plan to drawdown forces at the end of 2014 , especially without an agreement in place for the retention of @entity9 security personnel , a future similar to @entity2 's may be inevitable			1
however , unlike @entity2 , this bleak @entity31 future need not necessarily become reality			2
the @entity9 still has an opportunity to avoid making the same mistakes it made in @entity2			2
to accomplish this , the @entity9 needs to redouble its efforts at training the @entity31 army to develop it into a legitimate fighting force			2
it needs to put diplomatic pressure on the new president as soon as he takes office to embark on a unification and reconciliation process			0
and most important , it needs to plan for a withdrawal based on appropriate benchmarks and conditions , not on a political timetable			0
such a change in strategy would undoubtedly be domestically unpopular			0
but sometimes , unpopularity is a necessary price for avoiding a far worse alternative in the future			0
