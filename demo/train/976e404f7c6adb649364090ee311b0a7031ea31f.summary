nearly 10 months after their son died , the parents of @entity1 are finally getting what they 've been asking for : another investigation into the teen 's mysterious death in the gym of @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
@entity11 , the @entity12 , said thursday that federal authorities will investigate the circumstances behind the death of @entity1 , whose bloody body was found inside a rolled - up gym mat on january 11			1
@entity1 's family suspects the 17 - year - old was murdered and that someone has tried to cover up evidence in the case			1
while warning his jurisdiction is limited as a federal prosecutor , @entity11 said that after lengthy review of evidence collected by authorities and the family 's own investigator that " sufficient basis exists " to warrant a formal review of the facts			1
should evidence gathered in the investigation warrant criminal or civil rights charges , he said he would recommend them			0
" i will follow the facts wherever they lead			0
my objective is to discover the truth , " he said			0
who was @entity1 ? in addition to suspicions of a coverup , the family 's lawyer has also raised civil rights concerns , questioning whether officials in the predominantly white county took the investigation of an @entity51 teenager 's death seriously enough			1
" we 're happy that a fresh pair of eyes is starting to look at @entity1 's case , " @entity1 's father , @entity53 , told @entity55 's @entity54 on thursday			1
" we 're just waiting on the truth to really come out			2
" @entity55 legal analyst @entity60 called the announcement " a significant development for this family and this case			2
" " now you have the resources of the federal government , in particular the @entity69 , " she told @entity55 's @entity65			2
" with that type of resources directed at this investigation , there will be more answers to be found			0
" the announcement comes a day after a judge granted the family and @entity55 access to surveillance images and investigative files related to the case , which the @entity83 sheriff 's office had declared accidental			1
@entity55 has been reporting on the case for months , uncovering new details of the teen 's death and raising questions about the sheriff 's office handling of the case			1
among other things , @entity55 obtained death - scene images that led outside exerts to question the official explanation that @entity1 had suffocated reaching for a sneaker			1
" his parents never accepted this explanation that he climbed into a wrestling mat got stuck and died			0
it flew in the face of all common sense , " @entity97 , a family attorney , told @entity55 's @entity54			1
" this is a murder - mystery and we 're going to get to the bottom of it , " he said			1
gym mat death shocker : body stuffed with newspaper a mysterious death authorities found @entity1 's body on january 11 , wedged into a rolled - up wrestling mat in the high school gym			1
imagery obtained by @entity55 -- a 15 - minute video and nearly 700 photos taken by sheriff 's investigators -- show his body clad in jeans and layered orange and white t - shirts			2
his face was bloated with pooled blood , some of which had poured out of his body , soaking his dreadlocks and spilling onto the floor			0
within 24 hours of finding the body , @entity83 sheriff @entity128 announced that investigators had no reason to suspect foul play in the death			2
on thursday , @entity128 's attorney said that the sheriff welcomes @entity11 's decision to review the case , and will continue to cooperate " in every way			1
" " we appreciate mr. @entity11 's interest in these tragic circumstances and applaud his urging of the community to come forward with facts and evidence rather than feelings or opinions , no matter how sincere they may be , " said attorney @entity139			1
" while sheriff @entity128 has every confidence that his office 's investigation was handled with the necessary diligence to assure that all leads were examined and exhausted , he welcomes the @entity158 's further review of the case , " the attorney said			1
but a former @entity69 agent contacted by @entity55 to review the materials questioned those conclusions			0
@entity162 , now a private investigator , questioned how authorities handled evidence in the case , including blood smears found on a nearby wall they said were unrelated to the case			2
@entity162 also questioned the handling of a pair of gym shoes that had a substance that appeared to be blood on them			0
investigators told @entity55 the shoes were n't collected as evidence because the substance was not blood			0
despite the findings of state medical examiners who found no evidence of foul play , a private pathologist hired by the family to conduct a second autopsy after exhuming the teen 's body found that @entity1 had a blow to the right side of his neck " consistent with inflicted injury			1
" the pathologist also discovered that the teen 's organs had not been returned to his body after the initial autopsy			0
it had instead been stuffed with newspapers			0
the absence of the organs fueled the family 's suspicions of a coverup in their son 's death			1
" they know something happened in that gym , and they do n't want it to come out , " @entity53 said at the time			0
@entity1 's parents want answers brick walls for months , the family 's quest for answers went nowhere			1
it took until may for autopsy results to be issued , and then the sheriff 's office said the investigation had been closed			0
the sheriff 's office and school officials resisted the family 's request to obtain school surveillance images and other records , citing state law that exempts the release of " education records of a minor child			2
" after months of pursuing official answers and getting nowhere , they began staging daily rallies			0
a @entity236 tribute page and a @entity237 submitted by @entity1 's aunt spread the message far beyond the southeast @entity10 town			1
on monday , a @entity83 judge ruled that authorities had to turn over the surveillance records and files sought by the family -- the first step , family attorney @entity247 said -- in finding what they say is the truth about what had happened			1
@entity251 included in the release and reviewed by @entity55 shows him walking in a hallway and entering the gym			0
it also shows him inside the gym prior to his death , along with other students playing basketball			0
there is no indication that any of the people shown in the video have any knowledge of the events surrounding @entity1 's death			1
see the evidence a civil rights case ? @entity247 has alleged that if @entity1 had been white , the investigation would have gone differently			1
he does n't believe race tells the whole story though			0
" you have to consider race as a factor , but i do n't think that that 's the end - all in terms of trying to understand why this case was handled in the way that it was , " he said thursday			2
" we believe that , certainly , if there is a coverup it is a coverup for somebody , and not a nobody , " he said			0
@entity128 , the sheriff , is white , as are about 60 % of the county 's residents			0
however , sheriff 's office officials have rejected the claim that race influenced the case			2
" race never played into it , " @entity294 of the @entity295 said in may			0
" the victim played into it			0
that 's who we 're working for is the victim and the victim 's family			1
" @entity247 said none of the materials released monday are expected to show exactly what happened to @entity1			2
but they could cast doubt on the official explanation and nudge officials toward reclassifying @entity1 's death to allow a new investigation into what happened , @entity247 said			1
" essentially , it shifts the focus from what the sheriff had offered to other theories that were not explored and that have i think begun to slowly creep to the surface , " @entity247 said after the hearing			0
on thursday , @entity325 @entity324 said he has not made a decision yet on whether to open a coroner 's inquest into the death			2
that would be the first step in reclassifying the death to something other than accidental to allow a fresh investigation into the circumstances			2
@entity324 said he would make that decision in " the next day or so			0
" " and i 'm emphasizing the ' or so ' , " he said			0
regardless of what happens , @entity53 said thursday the family has no choice but to keep pressing on			0
" we 're fighting for @entity1 to the end , " he said .			2

" this is a murder - mystery and we 're going to get to the bottom of it , " says attorney
@entity1 's father : " we 're happy that a fresh pair of eyes is starting to look "
@entity352 attorney @entity11 announces " formal review " of case
@entity1 's family believe he was murdered ; authorities say the death was accidental
