@entity1 , @entity0 -- variations of two deadly superbugs that had previously only been discovered in the @entity5 have surfaced in @entity6			1
variations of two @entity5 strains of killer bacteria have cropped up in @entity6 , researchers say			1
the drug - resistant microorganisms are sweeping across communities in @entity13 and have the potential to unleash devastating results , according to researchers at the @entity17 at @entity18			2
" the people of @entity13 are not aware this is coming			0
it is killing people here and it is going to kill a lot of people there if we do n't act quickly , " dr. @entity21 , one of the lead researchers of the study , told @entity2			2
the study , which was carried out with the @entity31 in @entity32 , was published in the @entity33 on thursday			0
the bugs that have emerged in @entity13 are genetically related to two strains of bacteria -- @entity38 and @entity39 -- that have spread across the @entity5			1
@entity38 , or methicillin - resistant @entity40 , was once spread mainly in hospitals			0
in recent years , a number of people not in contact with hospitals have presented with the disease , which is a leading cause of severe skin infections in the @entity5			1
@entity39 , which stands for vancomycin - resistant @entity48 , mainly arises in hospitals and infects people in critical care units			0
both so - called superbugs can cause lethal infections and are resistant to antibiotics			1
there were no known cases of this type of @entity38 in @entity13 before 2005 , and no cases of @entity39 before 2001 , the study said			2
but a total of 15 mrsa infections have been reported in @entity13 in recent years and some 50 cases of @entity39 have been identified since it was first documented in the country			2
the @entity38 strain has also been found in @entity65 and @entity66			0
for some reason , the bacteria in @entity6 are acting in a similar way as their genetic forebears in the @entity5 , @entity21 , who is an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the @entity73 at @entity18 , said			1
they are becoming more resistant and spreading the same way , @entity21 explained			0
" the dramatic thing is the first 15 patients who had this disease presented out of hospital , and 20 percent of these patients died , " he said			0
researchers are tracking the cases to see how the organisms got to @entity6			1
the focus now , @entity21 said , is to establish the link between the two regions and to figure out how to control their spread .			0

superbugs that can cause lethal infections are *hitting* @entity6
the germs are genetically related to two strains of bacteria found in the @entity5
researchers are tracking cases to understand how the organisms got there
