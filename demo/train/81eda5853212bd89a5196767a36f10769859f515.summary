-- the flagging economy has been the clear - cut no. 1 issue for this year 's presidential race			1
but some other concerns are just timeless			0
" do n't underestimate the pull of safety and security in the minds of @entity14 voters , " said @entity5 , host of @entity0 's " @entity6 " and moderator of last week 's presidential debate			1
" there is no issue closer to home and hearth than the safety and security of your family			2
that is the most basic question the federal government has to answer			0
" president @entity25 and @entity27 challenger @entity26 face off monday night in the last of the three presidential debates , and they will be looking to convince voters that they can protect @entity14 and @entity14 interests abroad better than their opponent			1
foreign policy will be the focus in @entity35 , @entity36 , and there is plenty to talk about			1
there 's an ongoing war in @entity41 , civil war in @entity43 and a tense standoff between @entity45 and @entity46			1
terrorism is still an issue , as evidenced by the recent embassy attack in @entity50			0
and then there is a perceived threat from @entity53			2
whoever wins this election will have to make decisions on all of these global issues -- issues that might affect you personally			2
here 's a look at these likely debate topics and what 's at stake for @entity14			1
@entity41 : will the war really be over soon ? @entity25 has promised to withdraw combat troops in @entity41 by the end of 2014 , 13 years after the war began			2
@entity26 has said he would generally abide by the deadline , although he said he would solicit the advice of military commanders first			0
the plan , already under way , is to withdraw troops while gradually handing over power to @entity41 forces			2
but the feasibility of that plan is being questioned after some recent setbacks , including a rise in " green - on - blue " insider attacks			0
" insider attacks are particularly worrying because they call into question the most critical pillar of the @entity25 administration 's @entity41 strategy , which is to train and build a capable and credible @entity41 force that can maintain security and prevent the return of the @entity87 and @entity88 after foreign troops ' departure in two years , " said @entity89 , a senior research associate at the conservative think tank @entity90			1
" training and mentoring requires close partnership and is impossible without trust			0
" 5 things to watch in tonight 's debate will @entity41 be ready by the end of 2014 ? or will more @entity14 troops be needed longer to oversee security and ensure a successful handoff ? polls have shown that most @entity14 are tired of the war			1
a @entity0 / @entity105 survey from march indicated that only 25 % of @entity14 favored the war , and 55 % said the @entity14 should remove all of its troops before 2014			2
" we can not fight wars by polls , " defense secretary @entity108 said in response			0
" if we do that we 're in deep trouble			0
we have to operate based on what we believe is the best strategy to achieve the mission that we are embarked on			0
and the mission here is to safeguard our country by ensuring that the @entity87 and @entity88 never again find a safe haven in @entity41			2
" @entity45 : are we nearing the ' red line ' ? while the @entity14 tries to end one war , it is trying to prevent another			1
there are fears that @entity46 might stage a pre-emptive attack on @entity45 's nuclear facilities , drawing the @entity14 into conflict			1
or that the @entity14 might be the one to attack to protect its ally @entity46			2
@entity45 insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , but @entity46 and many @entity134 leaders believe @entity45 is trying to build atomic weapons			2
at the @entity137 last month , @entity46 prime minister @entity136 said : " it 's not a question of whether @entity45 will get the bomb			1
the question is at what stage can we stop @entity45 from getting the bomb			2
" this " red line " is under dispute			0
experts and policymakers differ about the time @entity45 would need to develop a nuclear weapon			0
but the clock is ticking			0
13 reasons to watch the last debate on @entity0 's platforms and nowhere else " @entity14 wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy , and we believe that there is still time and space to do so , " @entity25 said			1
" but that time is not unlimited			0
" make no mistake , a nuclear - armed @entity45 is not a challenge that can be contained			0
" @entity26 agrees , although his red line might be sooner than @entity25 's			0
@entity46 is also taking a much more urgent approach			0
" just imagine @entity45 aggression with nuclear weapons , " @entity136 said at the @entity137 " who among you would feel safe in the @entity168 ? who would be safe in @entity170 ? who would be safe in @entity14 ? who would be safe anywhere ? " @entity43 : should @entity14 step in ? the @entity175 has seen dictators fall as fledgling democracies try to find their feet , but one country , @entity43 , is still mired in civil war			1
every day , there are more reports of bloodshed and the humanitarian crisis worsens			0
thousands of @entity43 are dead , and more than a million people have been displaced as rebels battle the regime of president @entity188			0
" @entity14 are understandably reluctant to become embroiled in another war in the @entity168 , but as the situation in @entity43 continues to deteriorate , the costs of standing on the sidelines -- in terms of human tragedy , regional instability , and rising extremism -- are growing , " said @entity189 , a senior fellow for @entity14 foreign policy at the @entity191			1
" at what point does your cost - benefit calculation tip toward greater @entity14 intervention ? " @entity43 's key role in the heart of the @entity168 means there might be long - term geopolitical consequences at stake			1
@entity0 / @entity209 : ads , money and travel many analysts see the conflict as a proxy war between @entity45 and its @entity218 @entity217 rivals in the region , between @entity45 and the @entity14 , and even between the @entity14 and @entity220			1
there are also concerns that @entity43 could devolve , like @entity223 once did , into a bloody , sectarian battle that could further destabilize the region			0
and any time you talk about instability in the @entity168 , there are worries about @entity88 and other hard - line militants filling any power vacuums or failed states			0
one thing 's clear , says @entity0 's @entity235 : @entity43 's neighbors are getting worried			1
" @entity43 's problems will not stay confined to @entity43 , " he said			1
" @entity43 is a multi-sectarian society with shared identities with groups in other countries			0
as a result , the sectarian tensions that are being unleashed there are also spilling over from @entity43 's borders			1
" terrorism : @entity248 's dead			0
now what ? @entity248 was killed on president @entity25 's watch , and @entity88 's been significantly weakened over the past decade			0
but last month 's attack at the @entity252 in @entity50 -- an attack that killed four @entity14 , including @entity14 ambassador @entity253 -- shows that terrorists can still pose a threat			1
@entity25 has been criticized for security failings at the embassy and for not having enough intelligence about the attack , especially in the immediate aftermath			0
former house speaker @entity261 said the tragedy reflects the president 's foreign policy failings			1
" if we ca n't figure out what went on in a relatively open city in a country we had helped liberate , why do we think we know what 's going on with @entity45 's nuclear program ? " the former @entity272 speaker said on @entity0 's " @entity6			2
" @entity26 's new debate strategy @entity25 has taken an aggressive approach to pursuing @entity88 terrorists abroad , and he 's authorized six times as many drone strikes as his predecessor , according to @entity0 national security analyst @entity279			2
but will voters see the @entity282 attack as an indictment of his anti-terrorism efforts ? or will they consider it a tragic exception ? @entity53 : a different kind of threat @entity53 has been accused of anti-competitive trade practices that are undercutting @entity14 industries and handicapping the @entity14 economy			1
" one of the ways they do n't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency , " @entity26 said last week			0
" @entity53 has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years			0
" by keeping the value of its yuan low compared to the dollar , @entity53 makes its goods cheaper ( and more attractive ) to @entity14 consumers while @entity14 goods are more expensive to @entity53 consumers			1
that , of course , directly impacts @entity14 businesses and jobs			2
@entity25 has been applying pressure behind the scenes , said @entity313 , an economist at the @entity315 , and @entity53 has raised its exchange rate nearly 8 % from 2010 to april 2012			0
other economists , however , think the yuan is still undervalued			0
another way @entity53 directly the @entity14 is that it is one of @entity14 's leading creditors			1
there is concern that because @entity53 owns so much @entity14 debt , it might hold too much sway over what the @entity14 wants to do in the future			1
@entity329 : the race to 270 " a nation with our current levels of unsustainable debt ... can not hope to sustain for very long its superiority from a military perspective , or its influence in world affairs , " adm. @entity331 , former chairman of the @entity332 , said last month			0
a recent poll shows that the public is divided about what to do about @entity53			2
should the @entity14 be tougher on @entity344 or try to build a stronger relationship ? but a large majority in the poll say the @entity14 debt with @entity53 is a very serious problem , as is the loss of @entity14 jobs to @entity53 and the @entity14 trade deficit with @entity53			1
so even if tonight 's debate is about foreign policy , expect the economy to make a cameo			1
7 foreign policy questions you would ask @entity0 's @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 and @entity361 , and @entity363 's @entity362 , contributed to this report .			1

foreign policy is the focus of the third and last presidential debate monday night
safety , security have always been important issues to the @entity14 public
decisions on @entity41 , @entity45 , @entity43 might have a major impact on the military
@entity53 's policies are having a direct effect on @entity14 economy , jobs
