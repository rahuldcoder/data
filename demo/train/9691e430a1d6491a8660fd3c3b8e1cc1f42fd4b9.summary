-- they 're familiar characters in the debate over controversial @entity4 costumes : suicide bombers , geishas , gangsta rappers , rednecks and sexy nurses			1
such costumes regularly draw allegations of racism , sexism or insensitivity			0
but where do fully - clothed folk legends fit in ? @entity17 featured characters on both ends of the spectrum this month in its annual do - it - yourself @entity4 costume guide			1
below a collection of pin - up girl costumes -- including a model donning a breast - baring serape -- was " @entity27 , " the ghostly weeping woman who kidnaps wandering children , according to folklore in parts of @entity32			1
true , she was wearing a lace bustier under a shawl , but the layers upon layers make her appear more like the haunted bag lady than a sexy spirit			2
it 's the folk legend 's cultural significance -- and the lack of skin , save an inch of midriff -- that , for some , make this costume more acceptable than sexy señoritas or @entity50 tequila guy			1
@entity4 costumes inspired by internet memes " one is mythology , and the other is a stereotype that comes with a lot of baggage , " said feminist blogger @entity53 , assistant director of the @entity54 on women and gender at @entity57			1
it 's like dressing up as the @entity65 goddess @entity66 and paying tribute to a specific character instead of impersonating a stereotype that does n't represent the culture as a whole , she said			1
" @entity27 is a folk tale , our bogeyman , our witch from our culture			1
that as a costume is better than the idea of someone dressing up in a sombrero or poncho and deciding ' i 'm @entity50 today ! ' " @entity53 said			1
" we 're a culture , not a costume " returns it 's an argument similar to the one an @entity89 student group made last year in its " we 're a culture , not a costume " campaign that spoke out against dressing up as racial and ethnic stereotypes			1
the campaign went viral , generating memes often more offensive than the original images and sparking debate over the line between distasteful and playful			2
the response prompted the group , @entity100 , to refresh its campaign this year			2
in response to criticism that the campaign did not incorporate a " @entity106 stereotype , " the group added a new image of an " @entity109 costume " representing " hick " stereotypes , said @entity89 senior and @entity100 president @entity113			1
" [ we ] decided to continue with the posters because we agreed that they were not only successful last year but actually made a difference on campus and in the global community , " he said			0
" we were told by many professors that students wanted to talk about it , and this is exactly what we were looking to do			0
so we hoped we could put out another strong campaign this year that will continue the message of racial awareness and inclusively			2
" @entity113 says the line between playful and offensive falls at the point where the costume plays on negative and derogatory stereotypes of a marginalized culture			1
" when the costume portrays a hero or legend in general , i would say it is not offensive , " he said			2
" it is the act of either using the hero or legend ( or constructing a separate costume ) that over-exaggerates negative stereotypes that often stigmatize marginalized cultures that makes the costume offensive			2
" natural part of the " assimilation process " in other words , it 's the way the character is depicted that makes the differences			0
like the cartoonish skulls and decorations that traditionally adorn altars on @entity156 , the appropriation of @entity27 as a costume is a sign of mainstream @entity32 absorbing aspects of @entity163 culture , said @entity164 , founder and publisher of @entity166			1
" i think it 's a natural progression of the whole assimilation process , " @entity164 said			0
however , that she appears in the @entity17 ad alongside women in hot pants , tube tops and garter belts shows that the tendency to exploit female sexuality for the sake of costumes still prevails , both women agreed			2
in some ways , sexism in @entity32 's mass media bears some blame for perceptions of @entity184 as buxom sex objects , @entity164 said			0
" spanish - language media bring in programs from @entity188 and @entity189 on a daily basis that portrays @entity184 in this very sexy , provocative way			0
for people channel - surfing who are not familiar with the @entity163 community , those images stay in their mind , " she said			0
it 's not just a concern for @entity184 , @entity53 said			0
it 's something that all women should think about before they decide to dress as a sexy anything : geisha or farmer 's daughter			0
" there are costumes that take both of those problems and push them together and we need to deal with them , " she said			0
" it 's getting outrageous			0
" how are you celebrating @entity4 ? share your spooky photos with @entity212 .			0
