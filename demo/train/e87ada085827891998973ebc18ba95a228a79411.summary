@entity0 -- @entity2 , a rundown neighborhood near downtown , sits in the shadow of @entity6 , home to baseball 's @entity7			1
vacant buildings abut empty lots , which are rented for parking during games			2
the area feels like a ghost town during the day -- it 's not the sort of place you want to be at night -- but it can fill in fast			1
the @entity7 played the @entity18 on tuesday			2
police set up roadblocks while tailgaters cracked beers and music blared			2
as fans flooded the streets , they were struck by something new			0
painters , moving over walls like mechanical ants , were transforming nearby buildings into brightly colored murals			1
they were there for a project called @entity34			1
twenty artists converged on @entity0 this month as part of the annual conference , now in its fourth year			1
they come with one goal : to put art in the streets , in places it usually is n't , with the hope of sparking a conversation and effecting change			0
this year , 10 of the artists are local ; 10 are international			1
" it 's been so dead around here , " said @entity47 , 62			1
she sat under an umbrella in a @entity52 lot , where she has sold parking spaces for some 35 years			1
@entity55 ' spot gave her a clear view of at least one of the buildings being painted			0
" it 's beautiful where it used to be desolate			1
it brings everything alive , " she said			1
from graffiti to galleries : street vs. public art ' a change brings on new things ' the @entity69 artist known as @entity70 matched his wall			1
the artist wore blue pants and a blue shirt			0
both were covered in white paint , which he had used to draw birds against a blue background			1
" you can take your art and it can become part of real life , " he said			1
" when you place it in a certain environment , it becomes a part of the daily lives of the people that live in the space			1
" @entity70 , 27 , was one of several artists this year assigned walls in @entity52			1
they clustered around three blocks on @entity98			0
spray cans were stacked in cardboard boxes on the street			0
drops of yellow , blue and orange paint peppered the sidewalk			2
the murals were so large in some cases that the artists used cherry pickers to move around -- stopping to spray there , paint here			1
conference organizers provided the equipment and materials and worked to secure permission			0
unlike graffiti , these murals are legal -- a distinction many in the neighborhood were keen to draw			2
" i do n't like seeing graffiti			0
that 's just something that messes up peoples ' buildings			2
this is more like art , " said @entity123 , 66 , a house painter			0
he has been hired over the years to buff over graffiti on some of the same @entity52 buildings the artists painted			2
@entity130 , 50 , manager of a local restaurant , likewise said he had covered graffiti in the past , but would be happy to see more murals			1
" it makes you want to take care of your ' hood a little better now			0
you know , if you 're constantly waking up every morning -- seeing the same old thing that 's been here for years -- you think that 's how it goes			2
but a change brings on new things , " he said			2
' what we 're doing is extremely political ' as part of its conference , @entity34 hosts parties , lectures and a bike tour of the newly minted walls			1
the project has not been without controversy			1
two of the pieces created last year were subsequently painted over because of complaints			2
in one case , neighbors objected to nudity			0
in the other , some thought the image looked demonic			0
" after those two , i realized that what we 're doing is extremely political , " said @entity162 , 30 , co-founder of @entity34			1
this year , she said she warned artists their work could be short - lived			1
they were asked to submit sketches ahead of time , but no subject was off limits			0
" whatever you decide to do , it has to be part of this area , " @entity162 said she told the artists			1
the @entity178 artist @entity177 , who did one of the murals that got covered , came back to paint again this year			1
he worked on a so - called recycled wall , a space previously painted by another artist			0
" i love the ephemeral aspect of street art or graffiti			0
i do n't believe that things should stay put , " said @entity162			0
" even though it sucked that we had to lose two walls , it 's like @entity177 says , those two walls had beautiful lives			1
they were short lives , but they were very intense lives			0
they did what they needed to do and they made people think , " she said			0
" it created a dialogue			0
" @entity177 , whose first name is @entity205 , comes from a graffiti background and continues to work in that medium			0
he declined to give his last name because he said some of what he does is not legal			0
unlike some @entity52 residents , @entity177 , 24 , sees little difference between graffiti and murals			2
he aims to provoke in either case			0
" graffiti 's a sport			2
they 're just taking it to a whole new level , " said @entity162			0
