-- a @entity4 reservist who has been held in a @entity6 prison for more than six months on a weapons charge is " highly despondent " and his mental health has dramatically deteriorated in recent days , his mother said			1
sgt. @entity9 is currently in the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity6 , where he was transferred after allegations of torture at the prison where he was first incarcerated			1
while his family says cell conditions have improved , @entity9 's communication with the outside world has been limited in the last week after the prison phone he was using to talk to friends and family broke , limiting his contact , his mother @entity15 told @entity0			1
meanwhile , over the last six months his court case has dragged on and been unpredictable , with no certainty or timetable for his release			0
" he is lacking confidence that this will end soon and expeditiously , " his mother told @entity0 in an exclusive phone interview			0
" all we have ever asked for is an expeditious due process since he is a current @entity4 under contract until 2016			2
and the merits of the case surely point to accidental entry			0
" @entity9 was arrested march 31 at a @entity39 , @entity6 , checkpoint after @entity6 customs agents found three firearms in his truck , including a .45 - caliber pistol , a pump shotgun and an ar - 15 rifle			1
@entity6 's strict federal gun laws prohibit anyone illegally bringing weapons into the country			1
since his arrest , @entity9 has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the @entity53 side of the border into @entity39			1
his mother told @entity0 in may that @entity9 , who served in @entity55 , had moved to the @entity57 , @entity53 , area to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder			2
" he has unresolved , or untreated ptsd , and he can not get the cognitive therapy behavior that veterans of @entity64 receive ... in a @entity6 jail , where there is no such thing , " his mother told @entity0			2
" he 's highly discouraged there is no light at the end of the tunnel			0
" opinion : should @entity4 be in @entity6 prison ? doubts about his story the day of his arrest , @entity76 spent the day in @entity6 hanging out with other @entity4			1
he also rented a hotel in @entity39 where he had spent the previous night , he told @entity0 in an interview this summer			0
that detail has led some to doubt his story , including some in the @entity81 , who believe instead that he intended to cross into @entity6 the day of his arrest , a @entity81 source told @entity0			1
@entity9 's mother called any doubt about her son 's story " highly concerning " and said , " there is not one piece of evidence brought forward by the prosecution that would substantiate an intentional entry			1
" when asked by @entity0 , a @entity81 official did not respond to the question of doubt , but did release a statement			0
" we continue to provide extensive consular assistance to mr. @entity9 , and will do so until his case is resolved , " it said			2
" consular officers have visited mr. @entity9 20 times since his arrest on march 31			2
while we wo n't go into detail about our private diplomatic discussions on this case , @entity64 officials , including the secretary , have talked to @entity6 officials at the highest levels regarding mr. @entity9 's case			1
" the statement closed by saying , " we would like to point out that the @entity6 authorities have been extremely accommodating and willing to engage on this issue			2
" fueling speculation of wrongdoing , @entity116 , the director of the @entity39 checkpoint , told @entity6 media in june that border agents gave @entity9 a chance to surrender his weapons and return to the @entity64 without incident			1
" never , and i want to say this categorically , never did he say that he had made a mistake , " @entity125 was quoted as saying			0
" he never said , ' i got lost			0
' he never said , ' i am a @entity4			2
' " @entity9 told @entity0 in a phone interview from jail this summer that @entity125 's statement is " a lie " and added , " that 's not true at all			2
they never told me anything of that sort			0
" @entity9 said the @entity136 translator provided to him at the border added to the confusion			2
" after i had got off the phone with 911 and i felt like there was no one there to help me , i even told them , i said , ' you can take my guns , take my truck and take all my possessions			0
just let me go back to @entity64			0
' and they shook their head no in frustration			0
" admittedly , @entity9 had traveled into @entity6 several times before his arrest , but only on foot , according to his mother			1
opinion : a mother 's worst nightmare : my son is detained in @entity6 911 tape backs story ? in his latest evidentiary hearing , @entity9 's third official appearance before the judge , his defense submitted surveillance video that " coincided with @entity9 's truthful and forthcoming statement of accidental entry , " defense attorney @entity167 told @entity0			1
the video , which has not been made public , is said to show @entity9 hesitate and " appear lost " in his car at the border before driving up to the port of entry , his attorney said			2
the night of the incident , @entity9 called 911 to request assistance because he had accidentally crossed into @entity6			1
an operator can be heard telling the @entity4 that there was nothing that the @entity64 could do since he was already on @entity6 soil			1
" that 911 tape has not even yet made it to the hands of the judge , " his mother told @entity0			0
part of what 's complicated things for @entity9 is the drama surrounding his defense			0
the first two attorneys hired by the family were fired , one after trying to coach @entity9 into lying about prior visits to @entity6 , his mother told @entity0			1
there were also " missed opportunities , " something @entity167 , his current defense attorney , said is one of the reasons the @entity4 is still in @entity6 custody			1
" for anybody being involved in a criminal case in @entity6 ... those first 96 hours are crucial , " @entity167 told @entity0 in a july interview			0
" a lot can be done , and releases can and are obtained regularly , but you have to aggressively address a defensive strategy			0
" now , @entity167 says , his client is at the mercy of the @entity6 judicial system , and there is no timetable for his release			0
@entity4 says he 'd walked into @entity6 before his arrest on gun charges celebrity takes up cause over the last few months , there has been a groundswell of support for the jailed @entity4 from a wide range of people			1
not all of them have the @entity9 family 's backing			0
one rogue supporter has gone so far as to start an online petition for people to help her shut down ports of entry in the @entity229 until @entity9 is released			0
tv talk show host and mental health advocate @entity230 does have the @entity234 ' support and is working closely with the family to secure the @entity4 's release			0
a retired @entity238 lieutenant commander , @entity230 has written letters to @entity6 's president and others , calling for an end to the incarceration , citing concerns for @entity9 's declining mental health			1
" yes he broke the law , but he did n't have the capability mentally at the time , " @entity230 told @entity0			0
" it 's very easy for you to make one wrong turn			1
he knows he made a mistake			0
" as for those who do n't believe @entity9 , @entity230 said , " how about those who say that , you have a right to say it because he spent two tours in @entity55 protecting your @entity259 , which gives you the right to say anything you want			1
" pushing back tears , he continues , " all i 'm saying is , why do n't we look at this a little differently			0
he 's a sick young man , he 's an @entity64			0
he paid the price for us ! he 's this way because of us ! bring him home ! " @entity230 is among a list of people expected to testify at an october 1 hearing on @entity9 chaired by congressman @entity270 , head of the @entity271			1
just as support for @entity9 's release has grown , so has criticism of president @entity275 for his inaction on the case			0
congressman @entity278 of @entity279 said he urged vice president @entity280 to ask @entity275 to request @entity9 's release during a june meeting with @entity6 's president			1
the president never brought it up , @entity278 said			0
on the @entity6 side of the border , high level meetings regarding @entity287 are also taking place , according to a source in @entity6 's attorney general 's office			2
within the last week , senior @entity6 administration officials and others have met to discuss @entity9 's mental health and whether his condition could be cause for his release , the source told @entity0			1
ultimately , the decision of what to do with @entity9 is in the hands of the district judge hearing the evidence			2
if convicted , @entity9 is facing up to 21 years in prison			2
his next court hearing is september 29			1
@entity4 tells of abuse in @entity6 prison , but says he 's still hopeful @entity0 's @entity309 contributed to this report .			1

@entity9 has spent six months in a @entity11 , @entity6 , prison on a gun charge
the @entity4 reservist has repeatedly said he entered @entity6 after taking wrong turn
while some have expressed doubts about his story , lawyer says 911 call backs account
