-- filmmaker @entity3 has been arrested on an arrest warrant stemming from a decades - old sex charge , @entity2 police said sunday			1
@entity3 attends a film premiere in @entity7 , @entity8 , in june 2009			1
the @entity10 - winning director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13 - year - old girl , but fled the @entity16 before he could be sentenced			1
@entity16 authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 1978			0
he was taken into custody trying to enter @entity2 on saturday , @entity21 police said			0
@entity3 , 76 , has lived in @entity8 for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the @entity16 he declined to collect his @entity24 in person when he won it for " @entity26 " in 2003			1
he was en route to the @entity29 , which is holding a tribute to him , when he was arrested by @entity2 authorities , the festival said			1
@entity3 was nominated for best director @entity10 for " @entity34 " and " @entity35 , " and for best writing for " @entity37 , " which he also directed			1
" @entity3 , who is one of the greatest film directors of all time , would have been honored for his life 's work in @entity21 today , " the film festival said in a statement			1
" however yesterday , on saturday , he was taken into custody while attempting to enter @entity2 due to a request by @entity16 authorities in connection with an arrest warrant from 1978			0
" the @entity48 said @entity3 was put " in provisional detention			1
" but whether he can be extradited to the @entity16 " can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised , " a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail			2
" it is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision , " the spokesman wrote			1
" their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice			2
" @entity3 was accused of plying a 13 - year - old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor @entity72 's house			1
he was 43 at the time			0
@entity72 was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress @entity75 , was			0
according to a probation report contained in the filing , @entity76 described the victim as " sullen			0
" " she appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25			0
she did not look like a 13 - year - old scared little thing , " @entity76 said			1
she added that @entity3 did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl			1
" i do n't think he 's a bad man , " she said in the report			0
" i think he 's an unhappy man			0
" @entity3 pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor			1
there have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been @entity3 's refusal to return to attend hearings			2
prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who " drugged and raped a 13 - year - old child			1
" @entity3 's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a @entity110 judge rejected the request			1
in doing so , @entity113 judge @entity112 left the door open to reconsider his ruling if @entity3 shows up in court			1
@entity117 also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way @entity3 's case was handled years ago			2
according to court documents , @entity3 , his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they 'd worked out a deal that would spare @entity3 from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial			1
but the original judge in the case , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum - security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing			0
then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send @entity3 back to prison for another 48 days			2
@entity3 fled the @entity16 for @entity8 , where he was born			2
in the february hearing , @entity117 mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media - obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he did n't send @entity3 to prison			1
" it 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , " said @entity117			0
but he declined to dismiss the case entirely			0
legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare			0
@entity3 's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out			2
@entity155 filed court papers in january saying , " i am no longer a 13 - year - old child			1
i have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception			0
" every time this case is brought to the attention of the @entity113 , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others			0
that attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case			0
" @entity171 , now 45 , married and a mother of three , sued @entity3 and received an undisclosed settlement			2
she long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled			0
following @entity117 's ruling earlier this year , @entity171 's lawyer , @entity176 , said he was disappointed and that @entity117 " did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption			0
" he argued in court that had " mr. @entity3 been treated fairly " his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime			1
@entity3 was arrested two days after one of his wife 's killers died			2
the director 's pregnant wife , actress @entity190 , and four others were butchered by members of the @entity194 " family " in august 1969			0
@entity3 was filming in @entity195 at the time			2
by her own admission , @entity196 held the eight - months - pregnant @entity198 down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26 - year - old actress 16 times			1
@entity196 , 61 , died thursday			0
she had been suffering from terminal brain cancer			0
@entity0 's @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
