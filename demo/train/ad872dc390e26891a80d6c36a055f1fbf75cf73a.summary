-- the individual mandate might prove to be the death knell for president @entity4 's health care reform			1
politically , the polls have been clear			0
while most parts of the @entity8 are immensely popular with the public , as recent data from the @entity11 has shown , the individual mandate is unpopular			0
( a @entity0 poll found that a bare majority of @entity14 oppose the mandate to buy health insurance			2
) the @entity17 heard arguments last week over whether the mandate is constitutional , and the administration is now waiting to see if the court will dismantle this key part of the program -- or possibly throw out the entire health care law			1
although the individual mandate was born out of conservative proposals in the 1990s -- an effort to lower costs by requiring people to buy into the private market rather than creating a government program -- the presence of the mandate is also a product of the timidity liberals have displayed about their ideas since the 1990s			1
as @entity37 sociologist @entity36 has written in the @entity38 , during the 1990s the mandate was perceived as the " conservative alternative to the @entity41 ' proposed mandate on employers to pay for a share of health insurance			1
the @entity46 proposal was thought to represent a more individualistic , market - friendly approach			0
" whereas liberals were once willing to defend the role of the federal government in @entity14 life and , even more importantly , defend the costs that federal programs imposed on the citizenry , liberals since the @entity56 have relied on developing jerry - built solutions to domestic programs that are often unpalatable politically -- and do n't accomplish their goals			1
for much of the 20th century , liberals argued that government was an essential part of national life and that @entity14 would have to live up to certain obligations to support social programs that came with the privileges of citizenry			1
during the @entity69 , president @entity68 was not bashful about defending the value of government			0
in 1935 , for instance , @entity72 passed the @entity74 in which the federal government took over the role of providing old age insurance to the elderly			0
to finance the benefits , @entity68 and @entity72 created a payroll tax paid by workers and businesses			0
during @entity87 , as government spending skyrocketed as a result of defense needs , the @entity68 administration supported a massive expansion of the income tax			2
when the war started , only 4 million people paid income taxes			0
when the war ended , 44 million people were paying and taxes were withheld directly from paychecks			0
the @entity97 conducted a public relations campaign to sell the tax to @entity14 that emphasized that these were " taxes to beat the @entity101			0
" at the movies , @entity14 saw short films where a voice explained to @entity105 just how his money was being used ( and how he could take as exemptions @entity107 , @entity109 , and @entity110 )			0
this liberal ethic flourished for decades , even as liberals remained leery of the power of conservatism and aware of the long tradition of resistance to government in @entity14			2
during the 1960s , @entity118 , who avoided proposing any tax increases until 1967 , did talk to citizens about how a wealthy nation could afford to pay for programs that dealt with issues such as poverty and urban decay			0
with civil and voting rights , he called on the government to do what the private sector would not do on its own			2
on health care , @entity118 and @entity72 created @entity132 , which provided for a government takeover of the insurance costs of hospital stays for the elderly , funded through higher payroll taxes			1
when @entity139 championed health care , his vision was still very much akin to the " single - payer " model of other countries where the government would be the insurer of first resort			1
but during the 1980s , after @entity145 entered the @entity146 and the modern conservative era began , liberals retreated into a defensive stance			2
after @entity41 candidate @entity150 suffered at the polls in the 1984 campaign when he admitted that he would call for higher taxes , most democrats were resistant to proposing any kind of revenue increase			0
the shift could be seen with health care			1
when president @entity159 proposed health care reform in 1993 , he avoided the single - payer model that had been favored by older liberals like @entity139 for decades and instead opted for a complex system that aimed to create new mechanisms for offering and purchasing health insurance and stronger regulations to lower costs			1
the complexity of @entity159 's plan , which involved an employer mandate , left his program vulnerable to attack from @entity46 who characterized it as a frankenstein monster that would result in massive deficits			2
@entity4 fell into a similar trap with health care			1
although he was more open than many of his predecessors to championing an active government , he acted from a defensive posture			0
his health care proposal was even less ambitious than that of @entity159			1
he essentially chose a path that regulated the existing system and required all @entity14 to be part of it			0
@entity4 was not enthusiastic about any kind of single - payer option to compete with private markets and he allowed @entity72 to drop the public option that would create an alternative to private insurance			2
the result was an extraordinarily complex system , which depended on a mandate requiring the purchase of private insurance to make sure that costs were covered			2
the government intervention was indirect ; the financing mechanisms were murky			0
it is not surprising that the individual mandate has caused so many problems			0
at its core , the mandate constitutes a conservative solution to the problem of costs and part of an effort by liberals to ensure health care coverage without resorting to the kinds of government interventions that liberals once championed			1
@entity4 ultimately promoted the health care bill as a cost - cutting measure that would create greater efficiency in markets			1
he did not focus as much as his predecessors on the right to affordable health care that is implicit in the name of the bill			1
while conservatives have attacked the program -- focusing on the mandate -- with great clarity , the president 's hesitant defense of this complex system has done little to rally the public behind it			1
now he must wait to see if the @entity17 offers his critics justification that he overreached with his agenda			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			2

@entity239 : since @entity145 , liberals have been cautious about expanding government
conservatives first backed a private health care mandate in the 1990s
@entity4 *touted* efficiency in his bill , not the right to affordable care , @entity239 says
@entity4 's hesitant defense of a complex bill has n't *inspired* support , he says
