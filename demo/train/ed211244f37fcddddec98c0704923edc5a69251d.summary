an electrical failure ignited a dry , 15 - foot - tall christmas tree in a fire that destroyed an @entity5 , @entity6 , mansion , killing four children and their grandparents , @entity10 fire officials said wednesday			1
technology executive @entity11 ; his wife , @entity13 ; and four grandchildren died in what @entity16 agent @entity15 called " a tragic accident that occurred at the worst possible time while the @entity20 and their grandchildren were sleeping			1
" " the involvement of the christmas tree explains the heavy fire conditions , " fire chief @entity23 said at a news conference			1
the grandchildren have been identified as @entity29 , 8 ; @entity31 ( @entity30 ) @entity29 , 7 ; @entity33 , 8 ; and @entity32 , 6			0

" our tragedy has touched many lives in many families , and , in different degrees , is shared by each of us			0
our hope is that our loss will raise awareness that this tragic event could happen to any family			1
" the blaze started in the waterfront mansion 's great room , with 19 - foot ceilings and connections to living and sleeping areas			1
it was fed by a towering christmas tree that was cut about two months earlier , fire officials said			1
the tree was lit most of the time , officials said			0
" the fuel load from the christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and heat to cause the fire to spread as quickly as it did , " deputy chief @entity67 said			1
authorities were alerted within minutes by a fire - alarm system monitored outside the home and a neighbor 's 911 call			1
the home , which was constructed before 2005 legislation requiring a sprinkler system , did not have the devices			0
" we 're very comfortable that this was an accidental fire , " @entity23 said			1
the medical examiner 's office positively identified the victims , officials said			0
five bodies were recovered in the days after the fire ; the final one on monday			2
the children were visiting their grandparents for a sleepover because january 19 was a school holiday , a family spokeswoman said			1
" we believe that life is about making memories			0
as we work through our pain and loss , the memories we made with our family will sustain us , " the families ' statement said			1
officials said they were still conducting tests to determine the exact sequence of events , but believe the fire was sparked by a faulty electrical outlet			2
smoke detectors in homes are common but fire sprinklers are not , says the @entity113			2
fire sprinklers reduce the death rate by 83 % , property damage by 69 % and firefighter injuries by 65 %			2
fires in homes are responsible for more than 80 % of fire deaths in the @entity121 , according to the agency			2
christmas tree fires are three times more deadly than home fire in general , according to the @entity126			2
local and federal officials last week secured the structure and accessed the foundation of the 16,000 - square - foot house			2
cadaver dogs led them to the bodies , officials said			0
authorities were initially treating the house as a crime scene			2
officials said it is standard procedure for a case such as this and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity			0
the house belonged to @entity11 , chief operating officer for @entity145 , and his wife , @entity13 , company spokesman @entity143 said			1
the sheer size of the structure and the fact that three - fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement , with deep piles of debris still smoldering days after the blaze , compounded the search , @entity148 capt. @entity147 said			0
he led the investigation along with a team from the federal @entity16			0
" you 're looking at five standard houses put together , " he said last week			0
" this is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire			2
there are a lot of businesses that are n't 16,000 square feet			0
" fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. january 19			0
the @entity16 national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious , @entity147 said			0
the fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded , apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene			1
photos the fire department posted on @entity183 showed hoses stretched for long distances			0
@entity186 said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control			0
@entity11 's company biography described him as an industry veteran who has held multiple ceo positions , with more than 25 years ' experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management			1
