-- if golf has a reputation for being a bit stuffy , then the @entity2 brothers and their trick shots are a much - needed blast of fresh air			1
hailing from @entity9 , @entity10 and younger brother @entity11 have been attracting a growing band of followers with a colorful array of videos			1
from casually shooting hoops with a wedge to smashing shots from mid-air in the dark , the siblings are hoping to show off golf in a new light and attract a younger generation of players back to the sport			1
" we love golf , but most people think it 's kind of boring , " @entity2 told @entity0			2
" we 're providing something that 's a little different			0
we 're bringing a kind of hip , fun way to view golf and hope that it brings in a younger demographic			2
we want them to say : ' that 's fun , i wan na go try the game ' , " the 26 - year - old added			0
both brothers are qualified professionals and started filming trick shots as a hobby earlier this year , but it has quickly grown into a mini-industry after racking up tens of thousands of clicks on their website and @entity48			1
" most of the tricks are done on the fly , " explains 24 - year - old @entity11 , who smashes the balls set up by @entity10			0
" a lot of them work on the first or second try			0
if the ball comes into my hit zone then it normally goes pretty quick -- a lot quicker than what people say on the comments board , " he added			0
the pair started out experimenting at @entity64 & @entity65 , their local club in state capital @entity68 , but have since diversified their content			0
in the summer , a football - themed " @entity81 edition " celebrated this year 's tournament in @entity72 and collaborations with basketball trick shot specialists " @entity76 " and pro golfer and model @entity77 have widened their appeal			1
the brothers are not the only trick shot artists to showcase their skills online			2
@entity89 golf professional , @entity87 's incredible ball - juggling skills has received over half - a - million views on @entity48 and @entity92 trick shot specialist @entity91 has performed his routine at dozens of pro events including the @entity95 and the @entity96			2
when the @entity2 brothers are not dreaming up new routines , they compete on the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) @entity101 and the @entity102 , a developmental tour for the main @entity104 -- which is where the pair hope to end up playing one day			1
" the goal is really to use this to help our pro golf careers out , but at the same time we view this as a hobby , we both enjoy it , " @entity10 says			0
" and when we do have an off week , it 's good to get out minds off tournament golf and there 's no better outlet to be creative than trying some trick shots out and seeing how far we can take it			1
