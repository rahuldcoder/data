a judge in @entity8 is expected to hand down a verdict next week against @entity10 , 30 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , whose case has become the focal point of a grassroots letter - writing campaign via @entity16 that calls for his release			1
" it 's hard to be hopeful at this point , " @entity10 told @entity0 by telephone thursday from @entity8 , where he has been detained since his february 26 arrest			1
" i do n't want to think i 'm going to be getting out of here in a few days and then find i have to stay for seven years			0
" the @entity2 has charged @entity10 with theft of government property , possession of police paraphernalia and theft at night			1
if found guilty , he faces up to seven years in prison			0
the @entity29 confirmed that @entity10 was detained			1
@entity1 consular officers met him on february 28 before @entity2 authorities released him on bail march 1			1
officials in the @entity2 did not respond to a @entity0 request for comment			1
but investigators claim @entity10 stole a pair of official police handcuffs during questioning in an unrelated matter at a @entity8 police station the night before was due to leave the city , according to his attorney , @entity42			1
@entity10 has said it was a coincidence , saying he was brought in for questioning because he was in possession of a bottle of @entity48 rice wine -- a parting gift from colleagues			1
he was released without charges			0
@entity10 said he found the handcuffs a day earlier on the ground at a mall parking lot , about a mile and half from the police station where he was questioned			1
" i was thinking ' souvenir , ' " @entity10 said			1
" they were lying on the ground			0
so i picked them up			0
" @entity10 , who was on his way home after a six - week stint as a contractor for @entity65 , was arrested after authorities found the handcuffs in his luggage during a routine security screening at the @entity8 airport			1

it was during that second round of questioning , after hours of maintaining his innocence , he said he was beaten and forced to confess			0

' " @entity10 said he then signed a confession written in @entity91			2
" i have no idea what it said , " he said			0
@entity42 said there is little recourse for @entity10 as there were no witnesses to the alleged torture , though court documents show he initially said he was innocent , confessed and then recanted			1
" it is up to the judge to consider this , " @entity42 said			0
@entity10 said he recanted his confession after he was released from jail			2
he said he did not tell @entity1 consular officials who met with him while he was in jail nor did he file a complaint against the officer in the case because he was afraid he would be beaten again if he professed his innocence			1
@entity111 , a public affairs officer at the @entity112 in @entity113 , declined to comment because @entity10 had not authorized consular officials to act on his behalf with the media			2
the @entity1 @entity112 strongly advises travelers to the @entity2 and those transiting through the country to avoid carrying any type of law enforcement or security item , including weapons , body armor and handcuffs , according to its web site			1
it warns that people caught carrying such items will face criminal charges			1
" i do n't understand how they can do this ? " @entity10 said			2
" how can they put me away for seven years with no proof whatsoever ? " @entity10 has been living at a @entity8 hotel since authorities released him on march 1			2
in lieu of bail , @entity2 officials confiscated his passport to ensure he would appear in court , @entity42 said			2
nearly 1,000 people have appealed to @entity141 , the @entity2 ambassador to the @entity1 , and @entity143 of the @entity29 's @entity144 to intervene on @entity10 's behalf			1
" i urge you to do everything in your power to ensure @entity10 is treated fairly on may 19 with consideration of his illegal torture and coerced confession , " according to a sample letter posted on @entity16			2

" hundreds of others have posted messages of support			0
" imagine yourself in his place for about five minutes			0
then do something to help him , " urges @entity16 user @entity162			0
@entity10 said he was hanging on to hope that the letters from friends and family might make a difference in his case			2
last year , @entity2 authorities detained @entity171 of @entity172 for more than three months on charges of possessing weapons accessories -- parts that could accompany a gun , though no firearm itself			0
