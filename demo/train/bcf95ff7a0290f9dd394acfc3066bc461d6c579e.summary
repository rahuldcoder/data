" it is a completely different track to those at which we have raced before , and these 25 points feel different to @entity37			0

" i think i had my best start in all my career in @entity6 , i took four positions and in the first laps i was really quick			2
eventually though i could n't keep the same distance to second place so little by little they caught me			0
