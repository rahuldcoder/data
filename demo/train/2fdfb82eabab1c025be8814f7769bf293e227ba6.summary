-- bad news for @entity3 fans : @entity4 will not be playing drums at any of the group 's three gigs scheduled this year			1
in a long message posted on his website , @entity4 explained that he was simply not able to come to terms with his bandmates			1
the metal pioneers are playing their first show since 2005 this saturday evening at their hometown of @entity15 , @entity16 -- and @entity4 claims that he first learned of the gig through an ad on the @entity19			1
the original @entity3 lineup announced last november that they would reunite for a tour and their first album since 1978 's " @entity24 ! " less than two months later , guitarist @entity25 was diagnosed with lymphoma , prompting @entity3 to cancel the vast majority of their summer tour			1
weeks later , @entity4 announced via a @entity30 that he would not participate in the group 's reunion until he was presented with a " signable contract			1
" the group vowed to carry on without him and had recently announced a headlining gig at @entity36 , as well as a warm - up show in @entity15 this saturday			1
in his new letter , @entity4 says that the group asked him to play drums on three songs during their set at the @entity43 in june , an offer that he refused			1
on may 9 , @entity4 says , @entity3 asked him to play this saturday 's gig for free without any guarantee that he 'd get to perform at the other shows , which he ultimately turned down			1
here is the complete text of @entity4 's letter : " @entity51 , i sincerely regret to inform you that after a final effort to participate in the upcoming sabbath shows a failure to agree has continued			1
at this time i have to inform you that i wo n't be playing with @entity3 at the @entity15 gig dated may 19 , 2012 , nor will i be playing at @entity43 on june 10 , 2012			1
further , i will not be playing at @entity36 on august 3 , 2012			2
it is with a very sad heart that i bring you this news			2
i am sincerely passionate in my desire to play with the band , and i 'm very , very sorry that it 's fallen to this			1
this statement is even more painstaking to write , as i was particularly excited to play alongside @entity25 after the recent treatments he underwent			1
i wanted that to become a reality			2
to express my thoughts about you , the sabbath fans , i 'm going to speak to you all through an experience my brother @entity74 had recently			1
my brother @entity75 lives in the @entity76 when speaking with him a couple of days ago , he told me that an acquaintance had stopped him on the street and confronted him , ' is your brother playing @entity15 ? what 's going on ? i waited in line with my son and paid x amount for the concert tickets			1
' the man 's son is a young drummer			1
he 's going to see @entity3 , and he wants to see @entity4 play drums			1
upon hearing this news , i felt horrible			2
i could n't help feeling some resentment towards the failure to reach an agreement , the failure to remember where we came from , the failure to be as brothers , as we once were			2
to be clear , i 'm not blaming the other guys or finding any faults with them			1
i would think it ca n't be easy for them either , but this situation is just really sad			2
it 's sad that it 's come to this			1
' this ' will surely leave a mark and be unwelcome to the memory			0
hopefully ' this ' will heal and pass in time			0
my heart sank when @entity75 told me about this young boy			0
i know this boy is going to be disappointed , and i do n't know how to amend it , other than to put my arms around the boy and tell him i love him			0
sabbath fans have a voice and a face , to me you 're human , you have families and despair			1
you have ferocity and emotions and graciousness , and at this moment as far as i 'm concerned you are also that young boy in @entity16			1
i do n't know how to amend my part in these failings other than to put my arms around you and say i love you and let you know i 'm very , very sorry			1
throughout this process , which began over a year ago , i have had to stand up for myself time and time again			1
i have had to stand up for myself and in doing so realize my actions indirectly , although unintentionally , are upsetting and hurting a lot of you			0
i know in my heart i could n't have done these concerts by agreeing the terms suggested			0
i made a solemn vow after the last @entity137 and @entity138 concerts that i would never again enter into what was , in my opinion , a totally unsatisfactory contract			0
i have to stand for something , and as painful as it is , i 'm doing it			1
earlier in april 2012 , i 'd been asked to participate ' minimally ' in the download festival			1
i believe i 'd been offered no more than three songs to play while another drummer presumably played the rest of the show with @entity3			1
i was not willing to participate in that offer			0
i was not prepared to watch another drummer play a sabbath set , while i was to play only three songs			1
i found out about the @entity15 gig on monday , april 30 through the @entity19 ad			2
i was taken aback somewhat by the date , and the fact it was @entity15			0
knowing the " signable " contract negotiations were at best in shreds , i was upset by the idea that the band was going to play @entity15 and play it assumedly without me			2
i had no prior knowledge of the date and location , and i felt totally excluded			0
we contacted the representative for @entity3 to see if something could be worked out			1
in the meantime my drum crew and i , along with our @entity170 endorsers , finished all the necessary planning for a swift departure to the @entity76			0
there was n't a whole lot to complete ; we 'd all been on standby more or less since mid-january 2012			0
the remaining work in the @entity76 was confirmed done by our @entity137 and @entity76 endorsers and we were good to go by friday , may 4 2012			0
there were two stress points : firstly , getting an agreement in place , and secondly , getting to @entity16 in a timely manner			0
jetlag time was taken into account as well as drum practice , a drum practice room in the heart of @entity15 , accommodation , and travel arrangements were all in place to meet with any band rehearsals that may have transpired before the @entity15 show			0
so far everything that had been arranged was on my dime , but we did n't move ahead without a realistic confirmation			0
communications between the representative and my lawyer continued through the weekend of may 5 finalizing on wednesday , may 9			0
the offer we received on may 9 was , ' come to the @entity76 , play for free and see how the first show goes			1
playing for free would not have been a problem for me , but ' seeing how the first show goes ' left an element of risk which could have affected download			2
my ideal thought was to play in full the @entity15 show , in full @entity43 , and in full @entity36			2
i had notified the representative that may 10 was my cutoff day in order to have good lead - in time for @entity16			0
on the night of may 9 i asked for a brief letter to be sent to the representative asking to find out if we were at an end			2
on the morning of thursday , may 10 , i received a reply in the affirmative			0
after consulting with my advisors and crew a decision was made to let go and stop			0
i ca n't prioritize the sabbath fans making one show more important than the other			2
i ca n't do that			0
all of you are important			0
it 's all the gigs or none at all			1
i ca n't come to @entity15 and ' see what happens ' knowing there is a risk of not being able to play @entity43 or @entity36			2
again , for me , it 's all or nothing			2
i had to say ' no ' to @entity15 on the principle of wanting to play all the shows			2
saying no to @entity15 is very difficult for me			0
my family grew up in @entity15			0
@entity3 grew up in @entity15			1
it 's still my hometown and i resent having to arrive at such a difficult choice			2
although the statement was made that , ' the door is always open ' for me , as explained above , walking through that door is not always as easy as it sounds			2
there are many complicated issues and unseen and unspoken agendas on hand			0
i can assure you , my criteria for a " signable " contract is based in mindful principles , respectability , and acknowledgement of my history within the band			0
i hold no malice or resentment towards the other band members			0
i love them ; i 'm tolerant of them ; i 'm frustrated with them , as they may be with me			2
my fight has never been with them			0
i 'll love them forever			0
in my opinion , nobody wins this time ; the band does n't win ; the fans for an original lineup do n't win			0
even the ones who thought they did			0
i did n't want to make this decision , but i have to be honest and transparent			0
this is the statement i did n't want to write ; it 's the last thing i wanted to do			1
but , i have written it , and now it can go into the universe			0
since @entity279 of 2011 , i 've waited patiently and hopefully for a signable contract , you know the rest			0
i stand for the boy in the @entity76 , for the coming drum student , for all the drummers , who write their parts out and get stiffed on the publishing , i stand with the sabbath fans chanting ' @entity4 ' and asking ' why ? ' and i stand with @entity25 and @entity289 and @entity290			1
on a final note , even though i 'm at an end with the upcoming announced concerts , i will remain with an open mind and a position of willingness to negotiate ' signable ' terms with @entity3 's representatives in the future			1
with all my heart and strength , i love you , @entity4 " see the full story at @entity0			1
