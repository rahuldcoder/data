-- it is hard enough to make one good video game			1
trying to make two at the same time is a challenge not many developers try to tackle			2
but the creators of a recently released , turn - based strategy game hope that by blending two differing styles of play in one title they will find a pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow			1
" @entity15 : @entity20 " is a science fiction , strategy game pitting @entity18 against an invading alien force			1
an elite group of soldiers , scientists and engineers from all over the globe is tasked with repelling the aliens and restoring peace to our planet			2
while most games take two to three years before hitting the shelf , lead designer @entity30 said his split - personality labor of love has taken more than four years to come to fruition			1
" i 've been trying to make this game for as long as i 've been in the industry , " he said			1
" the original ' @entity15 ' game is my favorite game			1
" the resource management game mainly takes place in the @entity15 headquarters			1
it is where you find out about each new mission , but also where you tell scientists to start exploring new technology or have engineers build a containment area so you can interrogate alien captives			2
you 'll also have to manage finances , deal with demands from different countries and develop your military force			2
building out the " ant farm , " as @entity30 calls it , takes some planning by the player , but can result in bonuses if done well			2
" some things are tied into the narrative and you only get one base , " he said			2
" but we wanted players to have an emotional connection to their base			0
in the ( on - base ) bar , soldiers who are killed during combat will have their names on a plaque to show you what your victories cost in human lives			1
" the field squad portion of the game is more about combat tactics , maximizing your weaponry and out - thinking ( and out - shooting ) the enemy			1
squads consist of four to six soldiers , each with their own names , backgrounds and expertise			0
use them wisely ( i.e. , keep them alive ) to complete the missions and they get stronger			0
the action is still turn - based , so planning and strategy are important at this level as well			1
set up your soldiers , hope the aliens walk into your kill zone and cut them down			0
@entity98 wrong and players can only watch helplessly as their soldiers get outflanked and end up on the board in the bar			0
@entity30 said developing the combat portion of the game was fun from the very beginning , but that , for the longest time , the resource part was n't			1
it created a lot of tension and sleepless nights for @entity30 and his crew , but they hit on a revelation that helped them find the sweet spot for " @entity15 : @entity20			1
" " the way it has to work -- they have to feed off each other in a symbiotic relationship			0
they give each other meaning , " he said			0
" you research lasers and now my favorite soldier has a laser rifle			0
when i shoot , i see a laser coming out			0
( the connection between the modes ) feels more real because there are all these concrete things behind it			0
" there was initially a lingering fear with how the game was being developed , he said			2
developers ran the risk of alienating players who might like one part of the game , but not the other			2
" ( @entity151 creative director and ' civilization ' creator ) @entity147 " has a quote -- ' one good game is better than two great games , ' " @entity30 said , jokingly referring to @entity147 as " my lord and master			1
" " the danger of having two games in one game is that people are going to enjoy one of them more than the other			2
" but he said his team tried developing a resource strategy - only game and a combat - only game , and both felt like they were missing something			1
the soldiers really had no personal connection to the player in the resource portion and the mission rewards did n't mean as much in the combat game			1
" there are some games that have these multiple modes to them , but nothing like this			0
in ' @entity180 , ' you go back to the ship or in ' @entity182 , ' you go back to the town			0
those are n't really games ; they are just breaks			0
in ' @entity15 , ' you have a game , then you go on to another game			1
" trying to find the middle ground took a lot of trial and error			0
the pendulum kept swinging from overly complicated to overly simplified , @entity30 said			0
in the end , decisions were made based on how well they worked with both aspects of the game			1
" it just came down to stripping out a lot of things that were n't working and getting a flow in there , " @entity30 said			0
" you come back to the base and say these things have meaning for me			0
on the soldier side , deepening the class system and customization became important			0
" " it was pretty organic			0
it was a process that i did n't have a road map for			0
" @entity30 was very careful not to tread on the memories of fans of the original " @entity15			1
" " they have a very large ownership in the game , so it is important to honor the name , " he said			2
" i ca n't tell you how many nights i 've lost sleep worrying about whether i 've made the game fun			2
" now , players can decide			0
the game was released tuesday in @entity226 and comes out friday in @entity227 and @entity228			1
the game will be released on both the @entity231 and @entity232 consoles as well as for @entity233			1

" @entity15 : @entity20 " combines resource management and combat strategy
turn - based game is from @entity147 *'s* @entity151
designer says the elements felt lacking by themselves
