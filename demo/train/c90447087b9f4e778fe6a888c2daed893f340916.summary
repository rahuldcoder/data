@entity0 , @entity1 -- inside a sparkling new pool house off a dusty , bustling street in @entity1 's capital , sits a young man with a dream			1
@entity10 , an 18 - year - old double amputee , has already overcome so many challenges in his young life , some might be tempted to think he requires no assistance whatsoever			1
but adversity has made him wise beyond his years , and @entity10 knows better			2
his struggle has been a lonely one			0
" i need support , i need help because i 'm representing @entity1 -- especially disabled people , " says @entity10 , who more than anything , wants to swim for his country at the @entity19 in @entity20			1
landmines took his legs at age 11 as he was walking through a field near @entity0 's airport			1
it was while he was in the hospital that an @entity32 visitor noticed @entity10 and paid for him to go the @entity32 and get prosthetic limbs made			2
during his two years recovering there , @entity10 was encouraged to participate in sports and he learned @entity36			2
then he returned to his family in @entity1			2
@entity10 's younger brother , @entity38 , beams with pride as he watches his sibling swim the length of the pool			1
" he did n't lose his courage and power			0
he is very strong , and i am sure that he can take part in any competition			0
i am sure he will be successful and then the whole world can be proud of him			0
" at the pool , @entity10 shows us how athletics turned his life around , using his arms to lift his body off the tiles and then dive into the pool			2
" i do n't have any coach or any trainer to teach me how to swim , how to prepare for the games , so i 'm doing by myself , because i love swimming , " says @entity10			1
in a country torn apart by far too many years of war , @entity10 is far from the only athlete facing these types of challenges			2
female boxer trains in stadium where @entity68 executed women " i think the government of @entity1 has given the @entity71 too little assistance and enough attention has n't been paid to it either , " says @entity71 member @entity70			1
" the budget that the government has allocated to the @entity71 is almost nothing while we have got more sport federations than a lot of other countries			0
" to date , @entity1 has won a medal at the @entity83 only once -- at 2008 's @entity85 games when @entity86 won a bronze medal in taekwondo			1
@entity86 , who was swimming in the same pool as @entity10 when we visited , is keenly aware how difficult it is to excel in athletics in @entity1			1
" i know that we do n't have enough resources for sportsman in @entity1 , " says @entity86 , " but the younger generations in this country love sports , so they are making efforts to try and go out of the country for competitions			1
" they want to bring medals back home			0
that is why we are not hesitating and making every possible effort to compete on the worldwide scale			0
" @entity10 uses two pools in the city to practice , but neither are @entity71 regulation size			1
when he 's not swimming , @entity10 spends time at the track running and working to stay in shape			1
the tough regimen is rough on his prosthetic limbs and the tread on the bottom of them are wearing thin			0
@entity118 says replacements are impossible to come by in @entity0			0
@entity86 is very happy to see @entity10 make progress			1
" he is super smart and full of energy			0
i am really hoping for him to compete in the @entity19 , " says @entity86			0
" because at this point he has no legs but is still trying to serve his country in a way that he thinks he can and that is a very good thing			0
" @entity10 has others encouraging him to chase his @entity71 dream			1
friends and family also find hope in him -- something they say is missing in a country torn apart by far too many years of war			0
" i am so happy to see someone like him , who has no legs , still swimming , " says friend @entity135			0
" and often , even better than other people on the team			0
" as @entity10 waits to find out if he 's earned a spot at the games , he remains optimistic			1
he realizes the odds are n't exactly in his favor , but is sure things are bound to get better			0
" i am sure someday i will have some professional trainer , good teacher , good support and [ be ] representing @entity1 , and that my job will be to bring some medal for my country			2
" @entity10 knows that whatever happens , in a sense , he 's already won .			2
