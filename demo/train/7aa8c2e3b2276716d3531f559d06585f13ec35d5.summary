-- @entity1 watches at least part of every @entity4 game , every week , every year			1
after all , it 's part of his job			2
you may not have heard of him			2
but while @entity1 is watching the best football players in the world , they 're watching him , too			1
" i get a lot of feedback from @entity18 , " said @entity1 , the so - called ratings czar for " @entity13 , " the uber - popular video game franchise that rolled out its 25th annual edition on tuesday			1
" guys like ( @entity21 cornerback ) @entity20 , ( @entity22 wide receiver ) @entity20 -- these guys all follow me and make sure to give me feedback			2
" they always want to know ahead of time : ' what have you got me at ? ' " that 's because it 's @entity1 's job to come up with the numerical ratings -- from 1 to 100 -- that determine how skilled players , and by extension their teams , are at various facets of the game			1
it 's a unique challenge			2
although there are shooter games that emulate real - world weapons and military units , only sports games require their creators to assess , and then re-create , real - life humans as virtual avatars			2
that 's bound to rankle some folks -- if not the @entity4 players themselves , then " @entity49 " gamers who are often their most rabid fans			1
by most accounts , though , @entity1 and his team at @entity51 , publisher of the " @entity49 " series , do a good job			1
" @entity51 is not just pulling numbers from a hat , " said @entity56 , host of @entity57			0
" gamers are uptight about their favorite team 's ratings because ... they see their team 's running back make one great spin move that completely fakes out a defender , and when they try it in a game , they fail			1
they look up the player attributes and realize he has a 64 @entity72 , then they get angry and tweet @entity1			1
" that 's all part of the job , says @entity1			1
" if you 're a @entity77 fan who was mad some @entity77 were underrated , we 're probably doing our job , " he said			0
" everybody ca n't be a 99			0
" @entity1 has a lot of raw data to work with			1
in addition to on - field stats , there are 40 - yard - dash times , scouting - combine scores for rookies , injury reports and the like			1
and a whole host of websites have sprung up to hyperanalyze performance , breaking down stats into super-specific categories , like " downfield passing completion percentage			1
" but football is also a game of intangibles			1
sometimes it takes watching a player accomplish things on the field that the raw data do n't show			0
@entity1 is thankful for @entity49 's weekly online updates ( a feature that earlier versions obviously did n't have ) , which let him tweak player stats based on their performance throughout the season			1
he cites @entity110 , the lightly regarded sixth - round pick out of @entity112 who ended up tallying 1,613 yards and 13 touchdowns last year for the @entity115			0
" there was not a whole lot of buzz around him , really ; he ran a terribly slow time at the combo , " @entity1 said			1
" then , he started blowing up			0
" @entity110 started the season on " @entity49 " with a 65 rating			0
by the end of the year , thanks to weekly updates , he 'd risen to an 89			1
" we were wrong about him to begin with , but the whole league was , " he said			0
" ( @entity115 head coach ) @entity129 was probably surprised			0
" after actually watching on - field performance , @entity1 said , his best tool for adjusting player ratings may be those same fans who argue with him online			1
he adopted a stock response to fans who thought a player on their favorite team should have his numbers moved up			0
he says " ' ok , give me five up and five down , ' " he said			0
" when you made the fans give you the guys who should go down , that was some of the best feedback ever			0
" but it 's always more amusing when it 's the players themselves complaining , especially when it 's over something relatively ridiculous			2
every player gets a rating in every category , meaning kickers are rated for @entity155 -- the ability to bull over defenders -- and 300 - pound defensive linemen get @entity161 scores			2
but that did n't sit well when @entity164 defensive back @entity163 saw his throwing power rating of 21 and 23 for @entity166 -- a full 17 points behind @entity168 , a @entity164 offensive lineman			0
@entity163 played some quarterback in college and high school and posted a good - natured video titled " @entity49 ! " in it , he and @entity168 go through a series of passing drills , in which he predictably beats his 307 - pound teammate			0
" after that , i bumped up @entity163 ' power to way outdistance @entity168 , " @entity1 said			1
" but it was still terrible			0
you 'd never play him at quarterback			0
" that 's a silly example , but illustrates a bigger point : there are a lot of eyeballs on the best - selling " @entity49 " game series			2
@entity1 has worked at @entity51 since 1999 , when he was hired for the " @entity49 " testing group after winning an " @entity192 " tournament			1
he says that , for him , making the game as close as possible to the real thing is serious business			2
" i treat it with a lot of pride , " he said			0
" i know what 's at stake here			0
i just want to get it right			0
" @entity0 contributor @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 is the " ratings czar " for " @entity207 "
@entity1 says players sometimes ask , complain about their scores
he watches every @entity4 game and studies stats
with weekly updates , mistakes can be fixed *quickly* now
