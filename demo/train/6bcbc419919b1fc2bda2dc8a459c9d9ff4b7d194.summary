meets every year and brings about 3,000 national delegates together in @entity5 's @entity4 to discuss government reports , pass legislation and formalize appointments of government officials			1
the @entity1 is constitutionally the highest organ of government power in @entity2 although it has long been considered a rubber - stamp parliament			1
it passes virtually every measure , resolution and law put forward by the government or the @entity17			2
since the early 1990s , the @entity1 has passed several laws aimed at building up a legal system and has sought to promulgate a " rule by law " rather than a " rule by men " -- an attempt to steer the party away from its @entity27 structures to fit more closely the international norms that govern the world 's capital markets			1
the raft of new legislation passed at the @entity1 includes labor laws , securities laws , corporation laws , banking laws and environmental protection laws			1
the body also has the power to elect , dismiss and reassign local and central government officials , including the state president , the premier , top judges and ministers			0
despite this , elections are carefully choreographed , and typically there is only one candidate for one position			0
token disapproval or dissent is usually shown by means of abstentions rather than straight " no " votes			0
@entity55 and a new , younger crop of leaders are set to lead the @entity17 and the government over the next 10 years			1
the @entity17 is due for the reshuffle in the fall and the government will follow suit in spring 2013			0
barring any big surprises , current vice premier @entity63 , a protege of president @entity64 , is set to replace premier @entity66 , who will retire			2
when @entity2 's leaders convene , they will have a wide range of problems to tackle			1
among them : -- how to keep the economy growing at a fast enough rate ( the @entity74 currently estimates growth at 8.2 % ) at a time when the global economy is in recession			0
much of the @entity17 's legitimacy is predicated on economic growth which mitigates unemployment and social tensions			2
-- how quickly @entity2 can shift its economic growth model from manufacturing and exports to domestic consumption and services			2
-- how to bridge the growing divide between the rich and the poor to maintain social stability			0
-- how to keep these problems in check without significantly changing the political system and how to deal with pressure for political reforms			0
-- how to keep ethnic unrest in places like @entity98 and @entity99 in check			0
-- how to deal with the growing desire in @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 for more freedom while at the same time maintaining @entity2 's claim of sovereignty over them			1
@entity104 is likely to be in focus this congress because of its upcoming elections			0
-- how to manage its growing economic and political strength overseas without triggering a backlash among other countries , especially its neighbors and the @entity117			0
following three decades of economic reform , @entity2 is now an extremely complex and diverse country			2
problems of regional rivalries , corruption , environmental degradation , joblessness , fiscal shakiness , massive in - migration and social tension are now visible features of @entity2 's political and social landscape			1
what the @entity17 will have to face is that the old way of governing -- rule by edict over a submissive and poorly informed population -- is no longer working			0
more and more @entity2 are informed through the power of the media , particularly through microblogging sites like @entity138 which are now a valuable litmus of popular public opinion			2
more than 500 million @entity2 are internet users , and the country 's microbloggers are believed to number more than 200 million users			1
more and more @entity2 are unafraid to air their grievances , leading to thousands of " mass incidents " or spontaneous protests every year sparked by corruption , environmental damage , official abuse and land grabs .			1
