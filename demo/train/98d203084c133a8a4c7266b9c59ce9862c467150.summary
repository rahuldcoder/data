@entity0 , @entity1 -- an undersea cable plugging east @entity1 into high speed internet access went live thursday , providing an alternative to expensive satellite connections			1
the cable links southern @entity1 to @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity10 , the cable provider company , opened its 17,000 kilometer submarine cable , capable of 1.28 terabytes per second , allowing the region true connectivity			1
most @entity14 rely on expensive and slow satellite connections , which make the use of applications such as @entity17 and @entity18 extremely trying			1
" this is going to reduce the cost of doing business in @entity1 , within @entity1 and with international parties " said @entity19 , @entity10 spokesman in @entity1			1
" the cable is as thin as a hair strand , and in one second it can download the same amount of data that 160 people use in a month			0
" @entity10 , privately funded and 75 percent @entity1 owned , will provide retail carriers with open source access to inexpensive bandwidth			1
it has taken less than three years to complete the mammoth project , providing landing stations at @entity1 , @entity34 , @entity35 and other points along the east coast of @entity1			2
but telecoms analyst @entity38 said that some of the more ambitious hopes for the system -- such as impacting the continent 's socioeconomic problems -- will be long - term , and that initially it will be those already connected who will see the benefits			0
the launch was delayed by a month because of increased activity by pirates along parts of the @entity1 coast			2
security teams were beefed up to protect the slow moving cable layers			0
@entity54 , a @entity1 communications network operator , is the largest @entity10 customer in @entity1 and is the country 's landing partner , providing both the coastal landing station and @entity0 data center for the submarine cable			1
@entity54 managing director @entity62 is excited about the opportunities for growth presented by the @entity10 cable			2
" with this cable coming in , the pipe size opens up , so more and more people are able to get faster and better connectivity , hopefully at a lower price			0
it ca n't be more expensive than what it is today			0
" @entity10 chief executive officer @entity74 added : " turning the switch ' on ' creates a huge anticipation , but ultimately , @entity10 will be judged on the changes that take place on the continent over the coming years			0
" @entity1 has been hobbled by high costs and extremely slow bandwidth , effectively keeping the country on an information back road rather then the superhighway			0
there is much anticipation and hope that the cable will ensure @entity1 keeps up with the developed world in internet connectivity , providing greater speed , flexibility and , potentially , a complete socioeconomic transformation			2
@entity95 president @entity94 said in his opening address : " it 's the ultimate embodiment of modernity			0
" his speech was beamed via @entity10 from a launch in @entity101 , @entity95 , to the simultaneous launch in @entity0 , @entity1 .			1
