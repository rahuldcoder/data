it also called for a review of its working agreement with the @entity12 , demanded an independent investigation and ordered the immediate end of drone attacks along its border region			1

the government is deeply " distress ( ed ) on the campaign to malign @entity1 , launched by certain quarters in other countries without appreciating @entity1 's determined efforts and immense sacrifices in combating terror , " the resolution said			1
it also said more than 30,000 @entity1 civilians and more than 5,000 military personnel had been killed in its fight against terror " and the blowback emanating from actions of the @entity7 / @entity34 forces in @entity9			1
" anger over @entity12 drone strikes has mounted during the past year after it stepped up efforts along the @entity1 - @entity9 border			1
on friday , a suspected @entity12 drone strike killed four suspected @entity98 militants in the @entity100 region of @entity101 , according to two @entity1 intelligence officials			1

the demands by the @entity1 civilian government come as new details emerge about the raid on @entity13 's @entity113 compound			2
members of the @entity117 seal team that attacked the compound were wearing helmet - mounted digital cameras that recorded the mission , a @entity12 military official told @entity2 on friday			2

@entity13 's compound is also undergoing intense analysis , and @entity12 officials say he apparently enjoyed a support network in @entity1 that allowed him to stay in one location for the past several years			1
he had no escape plan or means to destroy his reams and gigabytes of documents in the event of an enemy assault , according to the @entity12 sources			2
two @entity12 lawmakers joined a public chorus for the release of photos of @entity13 's body after seeing the images themselves			2
" these are very graphic , gruesome pictures , " said rep. @entity171 , a @entity172 from @entity173			0
but seeing them " gave me a sense of finality and closure			0
