-- it might have felt as if the lights had been turned off but @entity3 still has a flicker of hope at the @entity6			1
woods was forced to abandon his efforts on the opening day of the inaugural $ 7 million tournament as thunderstorms brought a halt to proceedings on a gray and gloomy day on the on the @entity16 coast of @entity17			1
the @entity18 managed to complete 10 holes before play was stopped at 16.42pm local time with @entity3 six shots off the leaders			1
" i thought when we teed off we would be lucky to get in 11 holes and i was pretty spot on , " 14 - time major winner @entity3 told reporters			1
" so we got in about the right number of holes as it just gets dark so quickly and it 's like someone just turned off the light switch			2
" the air now also is heavy with moisture so the ball is not going very far compared to when we were warming up on the range and early in the round			0
" but towards the end we were hitting about a half - a - club short			0
" i 'm still working on getting a bit of the rust out of my game but then tomorrow is going to be a long day for all of us			0
" heavy thunderstorms around @entity44 meant that play did not get under way until 12.05 local time -- allowing only 15 players out of the 78 - strong field to complete their rounds			1
@entity7 will resume friday with six shots separating him from @entity54 duo @entity53 and @entity55 who sit on seven under part alongside @entity58 's @entity57			1
" it was a very aggressive start , " world number 97 @entity53 told reporters			2
" there are opportunities out there with two very reachable par - fives in the first four holes			2
" i knocked a driver and three - wood on the green at the first and holed for an eagle			0
it was foot flat to the floor today and just fire at the pins , take advantage of the soft conditions and see what happens			0
" " the field is exceptionally strong and with the layout of the golf course , and the way it is set up , i fully expect somebody is going to get to maybe 20 plus under par this week			0
" the course , which has been designed by @entity83 , appeared to suit @entity53 's game			1
that should be of little surprise however , given @entity53 's past successes on courses set out by the @entity89			1
the @entity54 's past two @entity92 victories at the 2011 @entity93 and this year 's @entity94 have both come on @entity83 's courses			1
" i seem to play very well around @entity97 's golf courses , " he added			0
" i won in @entity98 a couple of years ago and then @entity99 this year			0
i do enjoy his golf courses			0
i have no idea why , but maybe the fact that you can be incredibly aggressive does bode well for me			0
" @entity104 and @entity105 both finished on six - under after recording rounds of 66 , while @entity108 's money - list leader @entity107 was forced to stop after reaching four - under through 10 .			2
