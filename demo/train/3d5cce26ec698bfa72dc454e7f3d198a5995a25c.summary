" could very well have been the theme music for the world of comedy in 2011			1
one month after the song 's april release , " bridesmaids " -- a movie seen as a risky box office proposition when it first came out -- landed in theaters , drawing in audiences ( of both genders ) in droves			1
some $ 169 million later , having quickly surpassed the records for highest grossing female - driven comedy and highest grossing @entity21 - produced comedy , it has also helped transform @entity23 , @entity24 and the rest of the cast into major stars while also racking up @entity28 and @entity30 nominations			1
so , looking back , why was it seen as so risky ? quite simply , as " bridesmaids " co-star @entity36 put it to @entity0 earlier this year , " there are n't a lot of huge studio films with huge female ensembles			1
" @entity39 writes for @entity40 and pointed out that , " we still have a long way to go in the way women are portrayed , especially in movies			2
for every ' bridesmaids , ' there are three depressing rom - coms in which a woman derives her self - worth from the success of her relationship			1
" @entity52 will tell if that changes			2
there were also some changes on the small screen this year			2
as " bridesmaids " surprised just about everyone in the movie business , the major television networks ( otherwise known as " @entity58 , " @entity62 and @entity59 and " @entity63 's " @entity61 's day job employers ) , picked up a number of comedy series with female protagonists , all of which have since been successful enough to get a full season order			1
in fact , the only sitcom with a lead male character to get picked up for the remainder of the season is @entity79 's " @entity78 " on @entity80 , as opposed to quickly canceled male - centric shows like " @entity82 " and " @entity83			1
" if there is one big star to come out of this tv season , it is @entity88 , whose show " @entity90 " has beaten lead - in " @entity94 " in the ratings on several occasions			1
" @entity88 is a genuine breakout star , " said tv critic @entity95 of the site @entity97			2
" without her , maybe that show would n't work			2
she really makes the show			2
i instantly liked it , because she brought something very distinctive and appealing			2
" @entity88 's quirky ( or " adorkable , " if you will ) character is based in large part on " @entity90 's " creator , first - time show runner @entity108			1
" i think probably ( after ) ' bridesmaids , ' there 's just sort of a feeling of more trust from the people in charge that women actually want to see shows and movies that are written and created by women as opposed to sort of shows created by men that women are just supposed to like , " @entity109 told reporters in november			1
" i feel like that trust just from a business sense is really important for empowering more women ( who create ) shows			2
" one such creator has not one , but two series that were given full seasons early on in the fall			2
stand - up comic @entity134 is the creator and star of the @entity138 sitcom " @entity140 , " and the co-creator , with " @entity141 's " @entity142 , of " 2 @entity143			1
" the @entity145 series , about a street smart food server ( @entity147 ) who has to teach a former rich girl ( @entity149 ) how to get by , has been regularly appearing among the 10 shows with the highest ratings each week			2
" it 's very telling to the times -- our dealing with being broke and being in that time where it 's hard to get a job , and i think people can relate to it , " @entity149 said			1
" with ' @entity90 , ' the way they play with that relationship with her and the guys , it 's very relevant to the times			1
i think that 's one reason they 're all so successful			0
and seeing women pushing boundaries , like on our show			0
" indeed , one thing that sets " 2 @entity143 " apart is the bawdy dialogue between the two stars			1
" girls our age do talk like that a lot of the time , " said @entity149			0
" it 's shocking , but a lot of what we say and do is very realistic to that , in our generation			0
" " i remember growing up on ' @entity186 ' reruns and i was always a big @entity187 fan , " said @entity149			0
" women in comedy have been something i 've followed my whole life			1
i do n't think it 's like , ' look , we 're letting women be funny			0
' women have always been funny , it 's just more recognizable , and there 's just so much at once			0
it 's not just one tv show , there 's this influx of it -- and i 'm definitely glad to be a part of that			1
i 'm proud to be in the company of all these funny women			0
" indeed , one only needs to say the two words " @entity208 " ( or " @entity209 " , for that matter ) , to realize this moment has been a long time coming			0
" what 's really interesting to me about the surge of women in television and film comedies is that a large part of it is really driven by ' @entity219 , ' " said @entity39			1
" @entity220 is directly responsible for @entity208 being able to do ' @entity221 , ' which really kicked off the whole movement by showing that women can be the driving force of comedy on a show , instead of just the beleaguered wife reacting to her husband 's jokes			1
@entity220 also produces ' @entity230 , ' which does a great job of letting both @entity233 and @entity235 shine , even in a more traditional sitcom setting			0
" " @entity230 " stars @entity233 and @entity238 as a couple adjusting to a new baby , and in a change of pace for tv , even in 2011 , @entity233 works as a producer for a talk show host , played by @entity246 , while @entity238 's character stays home with their daughter			1
@entity246 , who also starred in " bridesmaids , " was asked about the movie having positive implications for women in comedy , shortly after " @entity230 " ( created by her writing partner , @entity255 ) premiered on @entity138			1
" having people say that out loud certainly does n't hurt			0
it 's just kind of surprising to me because if i knew people felt that way i think i would have thrown in the towel a long time ago , " she said			0
" i 'm just going to keep my head down and keep doing what i 'm doing , because it should n't matter , because that 's not what i 'm doing it for			0
but if it allows people like me and my friends more work and more jobs , it 's great			0
but i 'm not going to lie			0
it 's surprising to hear that people are really that behind the times			0
" @entity246 is n't the only former " snl " female cast member joining prime time with @entity208 and @entity209			1
@entity279 , is a regular presence on @entity80 's new hit , " @entity286 , " which focuses on a teenage girl 's move from @entity284 to the suburbs			0
" we always looked at the fictitious suburban town , @entity289 , as being the land of the moms			0
the idea was this family without a mom moves into a town that is dominated and run by moms , " said @entity292 , creator of the show , who like @entity149 was also a big @entity187 fan growing up			0
" creating an ensemble of these women who -- parenting is their full time job , not just parenting these children but other people 's children			0
we found the best and brightest we could think of to populate this world			0
" those moms include @entity309 of " @entity310 , " in the scene - stealing role of @entity313			1
" i think you 're getting roles for women that are written by women that come at it differently and feel in some ways more authentic , " said @entity292			0
" i was a single mom when i had my older son , and everyone wanted a single mom show and i was always so surprised at the way they wanted to develop those shows			0
' why does she have to be perfect ? why is n't she a mess , why does n't she fall down on her face ? ' i think right now , we have so many female show runners , you have a more undiluted feed to what their point of view is and i think people are identifying with that and it feels different			2
" @entity95 said that women being behind the camera more and more will be the most important thing			0
" this season , ( that development ) is welcome and it should continue and if these shows work , it will continue			0
" ( on that note , already on tap for 2012 : @entity138 's " are you there , @entity348 ? " and @entity80 's " @entity349			1
" ) as for right now , " @entity90 's " @entity109 said that it 's great to see the diversity of shows by and about women being produced			1
" i personally think that they are all really funny , so i 'm just really happy to be sort of a part of this , whatever it is ... new moment , i guess			2
