@entity0 -- it reads like a palate - pleasing menu			1
you start out with a truffle soup , followed by oysters and then a main course of flounder with risotto and vegetables			2
there 's a side of potatoes and you finish it off with a scoop of ice cream			0
here 's the twist -- this all comes with a generous helping of dirt			1
not normal , backyard variety dirt , special nutrient - rich soil			1
the unique tasting menu is the creation of @entity26 , a former gymnast and boxer turned culinary inventor			1
@entity26 says the dirt menu was a logical addition for his quaint restaurant , @entity32 , which is located in @entity0 's @entity34 neighborhood			1
" this is a seafood restaurant , so we have the flavors from the ocean , " he says			0
" i was also looking for flavors from the earth			0
" the best sushi restaurants in @entity0 but this is not the typical dirt you 'd find it your backyard			1
it comes from a garden wholesaler , which provides the high quality soil , taken deep beneath the earth 's surface -- 10 meters down , in fact			2
@entity53 can take some comfort , perhaps			0
@entity26 tells us the soil is first lab tested , and then heated to extreme temperatures , to kill off any bacteria			1
after that process is complete @entity26 will work it into his menu			2
this special fare is certainly not dirt cheap			1
the set course is about us $ 110 per person			0
and how does it taste ? according to one adventurous eater , who wished to remain anonymous the night of our visit , " i did n't think it would be real dirt			2
i was a bit nervous			0
but it was a subtle taste			0
" when we ask @entity26 , about his next key ingredient , he shrugs and says he 's not sure			0
" this idea came about naturally			0
" whether diners dig into the dirt or not , it does take the idea of organic to a whole new level			2
@entity32 : 3 - 15 - 19 @entity86			1
@entity87 - ku , @entity0 ; @entity88			0

@entity32 ' special menu features *dishes* made with dirt
soil is heated to kill bacteria
menu is anything but dirt cheap
