-- @entity1 has gotten under my single - status skin			1
i 'm not sure how it took nearly a week for her @entity6 column , " why you 're not married , " to land in front of me , but it finally did			1
and now i 'm fired up -- not in an angry way but in the sort of way that made me skip to my desk , excited to type			1
to hear it from the thrice - divorced @entity1 , i 'm 41 and not married because of one ( or more ? ) of six reasons : i 'm a bitch , a slut , a liar , shallow , selfish or not good enough			1
is that all ? maybe i smell , too			1
i 'll be the first to admit i 've got issues ( c'mon , who does n't ? ) , but i 'm not owning these			1
perhaps she was talking about why her own marriages failed or was simply setting out to get a rise , which she did brilliantly			1
and while i 've been guilty of occasional transgressions that might fit in some of those unflattering boxes , @entity1 does n't touch why i 'm not married			1
based on the buzz surrounding her conversation - starting piece , i 'm laying down and lining up behind reason number seven : life happens			1
before reading on , know that i am not and refuse to be woe - is - me			1
like @entity37 , minus the killer body and bank account , i 'm happy			1
i skipped to my desk , dammit			1
of course i 'd love to meet and marry that one and only , but in the meantime i 'm living my life , and i 'm taking everything that 's been given me on the journey			1
maybe , like me , that 's where you are , too			1
maybe you spent your adolescence clashing with a stepfather who did n't get you emotionally			1
and maybe the father who did get you had been relegated by the courts , when you were 2 and your parents divorced , to every - other - weekend access			1
maybe your first love cheated on you , just around the time a second divorce rolled through your family			2
so maybe your faith in men and marriage was a little shaken before you teased your hair for the prom			2
but that 's nothing some therapy and better hair sense ca n't fix , right ? maybe you 're a searcher with a healthy dose of wanderlust , someone who needed time to commit to furniture , let alone a man , because there was so much you needed to see , do and become			1
maybe you were and still are a hopeful ( i refuse to say hopeless ) romantic who for years held a candle for the one you thought was @entity72			2
he 'd changed your life , after all , when he lured you to @entity75 ( though it could have been @entity77 , for all you cared ) -- allowing you to claim that @entity79 side of yourself you 'd never embraced before			1
and maybe he slipped and called you his soul mate at one point , a statement you caught and remembered			2
so even after you read the diary he 'd left out , oops , learned about the @entity86 woman with amazing eyes , broke up and dated others , you still held out hope for him			2
you stupidly took the crumbs he tossed you from time to time and thought they had meaning			2
finally , you got through your thick noggin that the guy just was n't that into you			2
hell , he was n't even all that nice to you			2
you learned he was n't the one who got away			2
he was the one who got in the way			2
then , maybe you met the one who was that into you			2
he loved and respected you like no man had before			2
and the dog -- how could you not fall for the man and his dog ? one day , while taking a break from kayaking , when you least expected it , maybe he pulled out a ring and asked you to marry him			2
maybe you said yes but then freaked out			2
you could n't eat dinner , and you love dinner			2
maybe you snuck out of the b&b in the middle of the night			0
you found a pay phone and called your father , with whom you 'd grown profoundly close , sobbing			0
maybe you were seized by fear			0
but everyone around you , including your therapist , said they expected nothing less , given your family history			1
they even said it would be weird if you did n't freak out			0
so you were engaged to be married			1
but maybe after you moved to a new state and settled into engaged life , you still worried			1
that fear , that inkling that something was missing or wrong , grew stronger			0
maybe you became a genius at dodging wedding questions			0
maybe you lost countless hours of sleep , watching him and the dog as they slept peacefully , struggling with what you felt			0
you did n't want to quit the race , but at some point you knew with painful clarity there was a hurdle you two could n't clear			0
so maybe , out of your love for him and yourself , you handed back the ring and left			0
maybe you wished you could share custody of the dog			0
maybe , even as you licked those wounds in your pathetic little apartment , you began to appreciate your courage			0
you learned to trust yourself more			0
you realized your past did n't define your future ; you did			0
and then , maybe when you were finally prepared to date again , you woke up a single jew living in @entity150			0
but being a single jew in @entity150 would n't matter , because then life tossed you a doozy that put the pain of a called - off engagement to shame			1
maybe you suddenly lost your father			0
being emotionally available for someone else was n't something you could even entertain			0
now you had an excuse not to date			0
but maybe you knew that your dad -- not to mention your amazing mom and stepmom , and your now - gentler ex-stepdad -- wanted nothing more than for you to love and be loved			0
so when you were ready , with a fresh start in a new city , you were excited to put yourself out there again			0
maybe you were approaching 40 when you arrived in the @entity168			0
maybe you were slapped across the face with the reminder that most people your age are married with children			1
maybe you went to a singles event and became convinced you were the oldest one there , so you ducked out early			0
but maybe you held onto hope and optimism			0
you sucked up your pride and whipped up an online dating profile			0
you found out that men in @entity182 , as well as men with odd fetishes and offensively bad grammar and spelling , have a thing for you			0
you received horrifying -- yet hysterical -- notes from suitors that made for great @entity191 status updates			0
maybe you agreed to go on dates you dreaded because you were determined to have an open mind			0
maybe you learned you had good reasons to dread those dates			1
you wolfed down a nice piece of salmon as one man told you , within the first hour of meeting , that he cheated on his wife , still loves his ex-girlfriend and did n't go to his own father 's funeral			1
maybe you thought you should charge him for therapy			0
but maybe you still believe there 's someone great out there for you			1
you 're ready , you know you have so much to give , and you look forward to meeting him -- wherever and whenever that might be			1
and in the meantime , you know you have a lot to be grateful for			0
maybe you have a career you love , and through the stories of suffering you hear , you know that if still being single is your biggest problem , you are damn lucky			0
sure , you might be a bitch , a slut , a liar , shallow , selfish or not good enough			0
maybe , though , you happen to be 41 and single because life , real life with all its complications , has just worked out that way			1
but , hey , what do i know ? maybe that 's just me .			1
