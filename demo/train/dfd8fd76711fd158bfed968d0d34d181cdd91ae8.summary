-- @entity2 experts are throwing cold water on an idea backed by billionaire @entity6 founder @entity5 aimed at controlling the weather			1
@entity5 and scientists have applied for patents aimed at reducing the strength of oncoming hurricanes			1
gates and a dozen other scientists have raised eyebrows by submitting patent applications for a technology to reduce the danger of approaching hurricanes by cooling ocean temperatures			1
it 's a noble idea , given the horrible memories from @entity22 , which slammed into the @entity23 four years ago this week			2
the storm , which rated a frightening category 3 when it made landfall in @entity27 , was blamed for $ 81 billion in damaged and destroyed property and the deaths of more than 1,800 men , women and children			0
skeptics applaud the motive of the concept but question its feasibility			2
" the enormity of it , in order to do something effective , we 'd have to do something at a scale that humans have never really done before , " said @entity37 , a research scientist with the @entity38			1
how exactly would this hurricane - zapping technology work ? hurricanes are fueled by warm water , and cooling the waters surrounding a storm would slow a storm 's momentum			1
according to the patents , many tub - like barges would be placed directly in the path of an oncoming storm			1
each barge would have two conduits , each 500 feet long			0
one conduit would push the warm water from the ocean 's surface down			1
the other would bring up cold water where it lies deep undersea			0
world renowned hurricane expert @entity67 , who 's been studying and predicting the storms for a half - century , also doubts whether the proposal would work			1
" the problem is the storms come up so rapidly , " said @entity67 , a professor of atmospheric science at @entity73			1
" you only get two to three days warning			0
it 's very difficult to bring up enough cold water in two to three days to have much effect			0
" the idea itself is n't groundbreaking , according to @entity67 , who said it could only be feasible if the barges were put into place at the beginning of hurricane season with the idea that storms will come			1
" but you might do all that , and perhaps no storms would come			2
that 's an economic problem , " @entity67 said			1
even if the technology does work , @entity67 said it wo n't completely halt a hurricane			1
" there is no way to stop it			2
the storm might weaken in the center , but the outer areas would n't be affected much			2
" and flooding and storm surges are determined by these outer winds , @entity67 said			1
when word of @entity5 ' five patent applications first made headlines in july , alarmed bloggers lit up the @entity106 , expressing fears that playing with ocean temperatures could lead to catastrophe , possibly forcing a storm in a different direction			1
that 's not likely , said @entity113 , a professor in atmospheric sciences at @entity115			2
" you 're doing something to the ocean that the hurricane would have done anyway , " @entity113 said			2
cold water that churns up during a storm slows down a hurricane naturally			0
but the coldest water is usually at the rear of the storm , so sometimes it 's too late to weaken [ the storm ] , @entity113 said			0
" the key is doing it a little sooner than the storm itself does it and make [ the hurricane ] weaker than it would have been , " he said			0
" there are enough experiments to find out whether hurricanes ' natural cooling could steer the storm in a different location , and the answer is no , or it 's a very small chance			0
" while @entity113 believes the physics are conceivable , he says the cost of implementing the system should n't outweigh the benefit			0
" this would only be practical if the amount [ of money ] you spend doing this would be less than the damage caused by the hurricane , " @entity113 said			0
gates and scientist @entity154 , both listed as inventors on the patents , did not respond to @entity0 's requests to comment about their venture			0
the patents , which were only made public last month by the @entity160 , were filed in january by @entity161 the company is a subsidiary of @entity163 , an invention firm run by @entity6 's former chief technology officer @entity164			0
a spokeswoman for @entity163 , which holds about 27,000 technology patents , did n't elaborate on the cost associated with the patent			0
" at this point , there are no plans for deployment , so there is no talk of funding , " she said , adding that it could take up to 18 months for the patent application to be approved			0
regardless , inventors say that this technology is not something they 'll be rushing to use anytime soon			0
" this type of technology is not something humankind would use as a ' @entity184 ' or ' @entity185 , ' " @entity186 , an inventor in the @entity163 laboratory , wrote on the company blog			0
" these inventions are a ' @entity191 , ' where humans decide that we 've exhausted all our behavior changing and alternative energy options and need to rely on mitigation technologies			1
if our planet is in this severe situation , then our belief is that we should not be starting from scratch at investigating mitigation options			0
" @entity2 expert @entity67 agrees			1
" i do n't think this is anything that 's going to be done in the next few decades in a practical sense , but maybe further down the line , " @entity67 said			1
" i would love to see @entity5 , with all his money , use some of it to experiment			2

@entity2 experts doubt feasibility of @entity5 - backed weather - control idea
idea is " on a scale that humans have never really done before , " says @entity38
renowned @entity218 professor @entity67 : it wo n't completely stop hurricanes
theory : barges would cool ocean surface sapping energy from oncoming storms
