celebrations in @entity0 began saturday and continued overnight after the parliamentary vote , which many saw as the @entity51 nation 's first steps to building a free and democratic nation			1
the city 's main square -- once called @entity55 for @entity27 's political philosophy but now known as @entity58 's square for all those who fell in last year 's revolution -- became a focal point for the celebrations , with cars packing the square and surrounding streets			0
families and young men were driving , waving flags and honking horns , many to the tune of the revolutionary chant " raise your head up high , you are a free @entity4			2
" the last time @entity1 held an election was almost half a century ago and for many people , the act of casting a ballot was novel after 42 years of @entity27 's autocratic rule			2
@entity81 secretary - general ban ki - moon congratulated the @entity4 people on the election and also hailed the electoral staff for " well - conducted and transparent " polling			1
" last year , thousands of @entity4 sacrificed their lives or suffered lasting injury in order to win the right of the @entity4 people to build a new state founded on human dignity and the rule of law , " @entity86 said in a statement			1
" yesterday , their determination was again on display as men and women , young and old , cast their ballots , many with deep emotion , even in some areas where they faced threats to their security			0
