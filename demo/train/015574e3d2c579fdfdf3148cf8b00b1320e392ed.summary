-- long established as the premier portal for sound , your ears are facing increased competition from emerging techniques for transmission through your skeleton			2
bone conduction has rapidly become a critical asset for treatment of hearing loss			1
while a new generation of cochlear implants has had spectacular success in recent years , they rely on air conduction and the patient possessing a functional pathway from outer to inner ear			1
for patients with severely damaged pathways , such implants offer no solution			2
@entity28 ( bone anchored hearing aids ) units work by passing sound from a microphone to a magnet or implant beneath a patient 's skin , which is converted into vibrations in the skull and eventually arrives at the inner ear			1
this process extends the miracle of restored hearing to victims of such conditions as microtia or atresia , where the ear or canal is closed or deformed			1
" it 's the natural spectrum of sound compared with traditional hearing " , says @entity48 , spokesperson of hearing treatment company @entity49			1
" even with amplification it 's the same , there 's no distortion			0
" the company recently launched a wireless @entity28 set , an indication of the technology 's progress and growing popularity			1
implants have become smaller and less invasive , while cosmetics have improved so that the system can be worn without advertising it			0
bone conduction is not a new discovery			1
@entity70 overcame deafness by biting a metal rod attached to his piano to hear his work			1
neither do they need to be compensation for disability - such systems have been used by military in environments that require awareness as well as audio instructions			0
a member of the seal team which killed @entity85 wrote in his autobiography that bone conduction communication was critical to co-ordinating the raid			1
the innovation is beginning to seep into consumer electronics			0
in the early 2000s , headphone sets appeared that played music via the user 's bones , but the systems were hamstrung by high cost and low quality , with common complaints about muffled and distorted sound			1
the makers of @entity102 believe they have solved those problems with a unit that retails for $ 79			0
" the difficulty for bone conduction has been transmitting vibrations through bone with enough power for music , you need to be on the 20 - 20,000 hz frequency range , " says ceo @entity105			1
" we have been able to power dual transducers with enough vibration to make the sound musical , which has been our big breakthrough			0
" the bone conduction system offers key safety advantages over traditional earphones , by leaving the user 's ears free so that they are not distracted from their environment			1
it is even possible to drive wearing them , as they comply with the legal requirement to be able to hear on the road			2
the @entity130 of @entity131 have also supported the concept , stating that it causes less damage to the ears than ear buds			2
a flood of competitors are entering the market and innovation is not limited to headphones			2
@entity141 are using bone conduction rather than ear buds for their speaker system , although there have been teething problems			1
multiple patents are emerging for underwater and deep sea communication systems , and the technology has become cheap and accessible enough to be viable for novelty items such as talking pillows			1
the field has even expanded to offer audio communications through diverse body parts including the teeth and eyes			0
" in theory you can hear from anywhere " , says dr. @entity157 , ear biomechanics expert at @entity159			1
" although practically there would be disruption by having to pass through soft tissue depending on the point of contact			0
" the technology has offered a new dimension to advertisers , with @entity171 trialling a system on @entity174 trains that plays targeted messages to commuters as they lean against the window			2
the company claim a positive public reaction , and promise the concept will deliver social benefits through delivering announcements and emergency warnings			0
but the scheme has been controversial , with civil liberty activists arguing it is invasive and delivers content without consent			0
dr. @entity157 foresees another ethical concern			0
" as it vibrates your skull to generate sound , others around you can also potentially hear a message sent to you , so there will be privacy issues			2
that 's a problem that needs to be solved			0
" but he believes the major technological hurdles have been overcome			0
" there has been tremendous progress , from miniaturization , to wearable and wireless , so that we have reached the holy grail of not requiring earphones			0
" from medicine to entertainment , from reef diving to sleeping in our beds , we may have to get used to a whole new set of voices in our head			0

bone conduction technology is helping some **people** with hearing loss to hear again
but it could soon improve the lives of **people** with healthy hearing too
@entity141 uses it to communicate with users without blocking the ear
talking pillows , safer headphones , and underwater music are all in the *pipeline*
