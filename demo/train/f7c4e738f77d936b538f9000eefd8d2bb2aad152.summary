@entity0 , @entity1 -- at least 15 people were killed and more than 40 wounded in battles between the @entity6 militant group @entity5 and forces loyal to a renegade general in the eastern @entity1 city of @entity10 on monday , according to hospitals in the city			1
@entity13 erupted at about 2 a.m. when @entity5 fighters surrounded and attacked a @entity10 base belonging to a @entity1 army special forces unit that allied itself with renegade gen. @entity17 , according to residents and col. @entity19 , a spokesman for the self - declared @entity20			1
battles continued for hours in different parts of the city through the morning hours			0
live pictures on the privately owned @entity25 showed plumes of black smoke rising as explosions and gunfire could be heard in the distance			0
the fighting in @entity1 's second - largest city comes more than two weeks after the previously retired @entity33 -- without the consent of the @entity1 government and military command in @entity0 -- launched a ground an air assault against @entity40 groups in @entity10			1
most of the casualties that @entity43 received monday were @entity1 army soldiers			1
the @entity44 , meanwhile , said the son of its director was killed when a shell hit the director 's home during monday 's fighting			0
hospitals in the city called for blood donations as security forces asked residents to avoid the areas of fighting			0
" we remain concerned about the safety of @entity10 residents who are caught in the armed clashes			0
we urge all those involved in the clashes to spare residents and infrastructure , and urge @entity1 authorities to ensure the protection of @entity10 residents , " said @entity62 , @entity1 researcher for @entity63			1
the clashes appeared to be the most intense to hit @entity10 since @entity33 's may 16 offensive , dubbed @entity70 , against @entity40 militia bases in and near @entity10			1
more than 70 people were killed in that assault			0
without the blessing of the central government and the military command in @entity0 , some @entity1 military members joined @entity33 's offensive			1
the move underscored the difficulty that @entity0 has had in controlling the security situation in @entity10 , more than 400 miles to the east of the capital , since the 2011 revolution that toppled longtime ruler @entity85			0
in recent days , forces loyal to @entity33 have launched airstrikes in the city , according to residents and videos uploaded onto social media sites			2
one of the main targets of @entity33 's @entity10 campaign , which he said is an open - ended war to purge @entity1 of extremist groups , is @entity5 , which the @entity98 earlier this year named a terrorist group			1
the @entity98 says the group was involved in a september 2012 attack on a @entity98 diplomatic compound , killing ambassador @entity103 and three other @entity98			2
@entity104 has been mounting in @entity10 , the cradle of @entity1 's 2011 revolution , over deteriorating security in the past two years			2
bombings , killings and kidnappings became near daily in the city , and an assassination campaign mainly targeting security forces intensified in recent months			0
foreigners , judges , activists and , most recently , an outspoken newspaper editor are among the victims of these assassinations			0
no group has claimed responsibility for the violence that has gripped the city , but officials and residents have blamed it on @entity40 extremist groups that have grown in size and influence since the revolution			1
@entity1 's weak central government has been unable to secure the city , and one army unit in @entity10 , known as the special forces , has clashed several times with @entity5 since november			1
@entity135 divided over @entity17 's campaign @entity33 's campaign has further divided an already polarized country			1
a number of military units , officials and many @entity1 support his offensive against what they say is terrorism in their country			0
opponents , including moderate @entity149 , have described the move by @entity33 as a coup attempt			0
while many say they do not support @entity33 the person , they are backing his campaign as a first significant use of force against extremist groups			1
however , some fear the campaign does not make a distinction between the extremist @entity6 groups and moderate @entity149			2
on friday , hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of @entity0 , @entity10 and other cities in support of @entity33 's @entity70			2
in the capital , protesters carried a symbolic coffin -- with " @entity5 " written on one of its sides -- through @entity0 's @entity171			0
demonstrators hit it with their shoes before stomping on it and smashing it			0
the latest wave of outrage against the @entity6 group came a few days after one of its leaders held a news conference accusing @entity33 of carrying out a war against @entity185 and warned of consequences if the offensive continues			1
" we remind the criminal @entity33 and those who chose his path ... their insistence on this dirty war will unleash hell on him and the whole region , " @entity188 said			0
@entity198 accused the @entity98 of supporting @entity33 and threatened it if it intervened			2
" we remind @entity98 , if it tries to intervene , of its heinous defeats in @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202			0
@entity1 ... will only show @entity98 what is more severe than what it saw there , " he said			2
the @entity98 has denied any support to the campaign or recent contact with @entity33			1
meanwhile , @entity211 released a statement calling on @entity1 to fight @entity33			2
the statement , which appeared on @entity6 sites sunday , said @entity17 was waging a " war on @entity185 under the pretext of fighting terrorism " -- a war it said was backed by the @entity98 and financed by @entity219 @entity218 countries			1
the @entity211 affiliate in the region described @entity17 's assault as a " crusader plot " to stop the implementation of @entity228 , or @entity185 law , in @entity1			1
@entity2 's @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
