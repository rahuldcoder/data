-- pregnant again after two miscarriages , @entity1 was desperate for answers that could help prevent losing a third baby			2
when she heard about a small study to test the blood of pregnant women for chemicals , she signed up			2
the result was shocking : @entity1 's blood tested high for mercury , a heavy metal that can cause brain damage to a developing fetus			1
a @entity16 subcommittee tuesday will examine how chemicals that @entity18 are exposed to in daily life might be harming the health of children , including those developing in the womb			1
witnesses scheduled to appear at the @entity26 hearing include @entity28 administrator @entity27 and @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity29			1
@entity29 examined the topic in the @entity0 special " @entity35 " first broadcast in june , which focused on the impact of exposure to chemicals in daily life			1
the first hour was " @entity41 , " which looked at a once - rural town in @entity43 now surrounded by chemical plants , and the second hour was " @entity37 , " which examined chemicals in everyday life and their possible health effects			2
@entity29 : chemicals around us -- we must know more the special exposed stories such as @entity1 's situation , which she called " scary and disheartening			1
" " somehow my son was being exposed to mercury , and that 's a weight to carry because i feel like our job as parents is to protect them , to care for them , to nurture them and to keep them out of harm 's way , " @entity1 told @entity0 earlier this year			1
toxic chemicals finding their way into the womb a growing number of studies are finding hundreds of toxic chemicals in the bodies of mothers , and subsequently , in their babies after birth			2
while there is no science that demonstrates a conclusive cause - and - effect relationship between chemicals children are born with and particular health problems , studies are finding associations between elevated levels of chemicals in a baby 's body and their development			1
tuesday 's hearing , called by sen. @entity84 , @entity85 , will take place at the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity85			1
@entity84 has called for updating the federal regulations to require manufacturers to show chemicals are safe before introducing them on the market			1
other planned witnesses include @entity95 , a @entity85 mother of a child with autism and an immune system disorder ; dr. @entity99 , executive and medical director of the @entity102 ; and dr. @entity103 , director of the @entity104			1
@entity103 's center has been following hundreds of pregnant women over the past 12 years to measure chemicals entering the womb during pregnancy			1
the women trudge through @entity111 for 48 hours wearing special backpacks , each with a long tube that is slung over the shoulder			1
the tube , resting inches below the pregnant mom 's mouth , sucks air into a special filter , giving an approximate measurement of the air that she is breathing			1
the backpack is designed to measure ambient toxics spewed by vehicles and pesticides , along with chemicals from common household products			0
5 toxic chemicals : protect yourself " it surprised me when we analyzed the air samples [ from the backpacks ] and found 100 percent of them had detectable levels of at least one pesticide and the air pollutants we were interested in , " @entity103 , who also is a professor at the @entity132 , told @entity0 earlier this year			1
" so far , the toxics measured in the backpacks match what scientists are finding in the cord blood of the babies once they are born			0
small studies by other groups also are finding common household chemicals in babies			0
" we 've measured hundreds and hundreds of toxic chemicals in the blood of babies that are still in the womb , " said @entity149 , president of the @entity150 , a non-profit environmental advocacy organization			0
" flame retardants , the chemicals in consumer products like personal care products , makeup , shampoos			0
it 's a very long list			1
" the organization 's study found an average of 232 chemicals in the cord blood of 10 babies born in late 2009			2
they are chemicals found in a wide array of common household products , including shampoos and conditioners , cosmetics , plastics , shower curtains , mattresses , and electronics like computers and cell phones			0
everyday plastic , toxic fears @entity103 and her colleagues are following the children in their study from the uterus , through birth , and up to their first several years of life			0
they recently published a study in the journal pediatrics demonstrating an association between the chemicals they found in babies ' cord blood and later problems on intelligence tests and development			0
" fifteen percent of children [ in our study ] have at least one developmental problem , " @entity103 said			0
the amount of chemicals measured in the cord blood of the babies seems to matter			0
the higher the concentration , the more the iq among children seems to dip			0
the study is also being conducted among pregnant women in @entity211 and @entity212 , and finding similar results			0
@entity1 still struggles with the idea that mercury from her blood may have been passed to her baby			0
" there 's plastics , there 's mercury , there 's pesticides , " said @entity1 , who also is a practicing midwife			2
" the things that we 're cleaning our homes with , the things we 're building our houses with			0
i think the sheer volume of the things we have to worry about is a little overwhelming			0
" even when her son , @entity229 , now more than a year old , was born healthy , @entity1 and her husband remained vigilant			0
they steer clear of any products with potentially toxic chemicals			0
" knowing that he got these chemicals from my blood , it 's really scary , " @entity1 said , adding : " @entity229 and all of our future generations are carrying around this burden that we do n't know what it means yet			2
it 's the huge sea of unknown			2
" @entity0 medical news producer @entity244 contributed to this story .			1
