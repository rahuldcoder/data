-- back in 1950 , the @entity1 organized a contest for posters promoting the @entity5 @entity4			0
among over 10,000 entries , the winner was @entity8 , then barely 25 years old			0
his entry portrayed a ship braving stormy waters and a dark fog , pulled forward by multiple sails : the @entity15 's flags			2
the hull of the ship was made of letters spelling " @entity19 " and the caption read , " all our colours to the mast			1
" early on friday , the @entity23 in @entity24 did something unusual : instead of rewarding the @entity27 to an individual , it gave it to the @entity30 -- an international institution facing a 3 - year - old existential crisis that looks nowhere close to being over			1
almost immediately , critics pointed out the odd choice , mocking the award to an agglomeration of countries , many of which are in recession and internal turmoil			0
in the last two years , many a respectable economist has argued the end was nigh for @entity19 's single currency , as well as the @entity30 at large			1
@entity45 has been likened to the @entity46 and a fascistic government due to its perceived " democratic deficit , " the indictment that current supranational institutions do not answer to electorates directly enough			0
it 's safe to assume no comparison featuring the @entity46 is a happy one			2
but such criticism is gravely misplaced			0
the @entity57 communique does not begin to describe what the @entity30 has done for @entity19 , but history can			1
in the century between 1848 and 1945 , the @entity15 lived in constant crisis			1
nationalisms emerged , empires crumbled , and conflagration became the rule			0
@entity67 did @entity65 and @entity66 go to war with each other , and twice they dragged the whole world with them			1
one of those world wars involved an unspeakable genocide conducted at industrial scale by a developed nation			2
in its aftermath , as @entity77 warned , " an iron curtain descended across the @entity15 , " and whole nations lived in the misery and rubble left behind by aerial bombing			0
opinion : @entity27 a wasted opportunity along with demography and economics , ideas have the power to drive history			1
like @entity92 - sponsored free trade in the 19th century and revolutionary @entity93 in the early 20th , @entity90 integration caught on			1
a year after @entity95 finished his poster , the ship of @entity19 began to be built in earnest through the @entity99 , which effectively tied the economies of @entity66 and @entity65 together			1
by 1956 , the @entity101 proved itself no better than the devils it had once fought when it violently crushed the @entity104			0
in stark contrast , a year later six @entity90 nations signed the @entity107 , pledging " ever closer union " and giving birth to the @entity109 , which has since evolved into the @entity30			1
for countries long mired in internal divisions , @entity19 became a shining light			1
a remarkably peaceful transition in @entity115 followed three decades of iron - fisted dictatorship by @entity117 , brought about by a devastating civil war			1
in a country where philosopher @entity122 had once written that " @entity115 is the problem and @entity19 the solution , " the promise of integration underwrote @entity115 's first - ever successful experiment with democracy			1
similarly , authoritarian regimes in @entity128 and @entity129 gave way to @entity132 republics respectful of human rights			0
and when the @entity136 finally fell , what former @entity101 subjects wanted turned out to be not so different			0
they sought the freedoms and opportunities that the @entity30 embodies			1
the process of integration -- along with the work of organizations like the @entity143 -- contributed to a strengthening of democratic institutions in the @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148			0
no lasting dictatorial strongmen emerged , forcing many political scientists to revise their overly deterministic models			0
just compare the @entity153 fate of dictatorial @entity154 with that of democratic @entity156			0
with all its imperfections , @entity19 today is the largest single market in the world , featuring effective anti-trust regulations , curtailing economic nationalism , and promoting free trade agreements with counties as far away as @entity164 and @entity165			1
new potential members are eager to join , from booming @entity167 to crisis - ridden @entity168			2
despite all the talk of stalling , @entity167 membership will eventually come to pass			0
true enough , the sovereign debt crisis has revealed flaws in the design of the monetary union			2
and the democratic deficit must be addressed through directly elected @entity30 officers			1
but @entity19 is far more likely to emerge strengthened from the ordeal than apart			2
it 's not just @entity90 institutions like the central bank and the @entity182 that speak of " more @entity19 " as the solution			1
so do national leaders like the @entity66 president and the @entity187 prime minister			0
the disagreement is not so much about the federalist future , but about how to get there			0
that is why even the careful @entity193 chancellor speaks of @entity19 as a " @entity194 " -- a " community of destiny			2
" indeed , looking at the research from this year 's @entity199 winner in economics , @entity198 , @entity19 does not compare badly with the early @entity5 , which took a decade to transition from the @entity201 to the @entity202			1
the success of @entity8 's ship " @entity19 " is ultimately twofold			1
within its members and potential members , it has made the word " dictator " into an anachronism , a seemingly impossible feat from the perspective of 1945 , not to mention 1848			0
and beyond the @entity15 , it has proven that post-national integration is not only possible , but also desirable			0
the individual colors on the mast are still there -- but they all sail together			0
the @entity218 -- where the founding fathers in both @entity221 and @entity222 republics once dreamt of integration -- should take note			0
perhaps one day the @entity27 will reward that project			2
in the meantime , @entity19 sails on			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity229 : @entity27 awarded to @entity30 *stirred* *controversy*
he says the @entity30 helps ensure peace after a century of war and dictatorship
@entity19 is the world 's largest market , offering an arena for trade and commerce , he says
@entity229 : @entity19 financial crisis reveals need for reform , but @entity30 is still worth having
