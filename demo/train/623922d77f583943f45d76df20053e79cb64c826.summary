the quest to complete the first solar - powered flight around the world moved a bit closer to reality tuesday			1
@entity8 pilots @entity6 and @entity9 announced the @entity10 2 aircraft will depart the @entity12 on their historic adventure in late february or early march , making a total of 12 planned stops			1
the route includes landings in @entity18 ; @entity19 ; @entity20 ; @entity21 , @entity22 ; and @entity24 's @entity23			1
at speeds between 50 and 100 kilometers per hour ( 31 - 62 mph ) @entity6 and @entity9 aim to circle the globe flying about 25 days over a total of about five months			2
an earlier version of the plane was the first solar - powered aircraft of " perpetual endurance " to fly " day and night without a drop of fuel , " according to its website , thanks to advanced solar cells that charge light - weight lithium batteries			1
the batteries are able to store enough energy to allow the plane to fly long distances at night			2
developers say @entity10 2 takes what engineers learned from its predecessor and pushes it a step further			1
compare the aircraft 's wingspan to a giant @entity51 : solar impulse 2 is 12 feet wider -- at 236 feet			1
and it 's very lightweight , just 2Â½ tons , lighter than a large suv			0
with just one seat , designers acknowledge @entity52 is n't commercially practical			2
but that 's not the point			0
instead , engineers aim to demonstrate the possibilities of solar - powered aviation and to promote clean - energy technology			1
soon , the plane 's unique silhouette may be visible across the horizons of @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
cities on the planned route include the @entity19 communities of @entity73 and @entity74 , as well as @entity75 and @entity76 in @entity20			1
the pilots have already set a few solar aviation records			2
in 2010 , with @entity9 in the cockpit , a previous @entity10 became the first manned plane to fly for 24 hours on nothing but solar - powered batteries			1
the team followed that up in 2012 , when the plane flew from @entity86 to @entity87 , making it the first manned sun - powered plane to fly to another continent			1
and in 2013 , @entity6 and @entity9 flew an earlier version of @entity10 on a mission across the @entity93			2
@entity6 is a bona fide adventurer -- with world records to prove it			0
decades after pioneering ultralight aircraft in the 1970s , @entity6 and his colleague @entity96 were the first to circle the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999			0
their gondola is displayed at the @entity103			0
breaking barriers is a @entity6 family tradition			0
his grandfather explored the stratosphere in a pressurized chamber carried by a balloon			0
ten miles high , he was the first human to see the curvature of the planet with his own eyes			0
@entity6 's father plumbed the @entity114 , taking a special submarine to a record - setting depth of nearly 7 miles			0
@entity9 came to the project with more than two decades as a @entity8 @entity119 fighter pilot .			0

an attempt at the first solar - powered flight around the globe is set for late february
stops for @entity52 include @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity24
its lithium batteries store enough solar energy for nighttime flight
@entity10 2 's giant wings are wider than a *747* - 8 @entity133
