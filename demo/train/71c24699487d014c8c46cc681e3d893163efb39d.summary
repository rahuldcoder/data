-- " @entity1 " may have flopped , and " @entity2 " may have been all buzz and no buck , but @entity10 's " @entity9 " proved that there is a place for videogame - themed movies at the box office this weekend			1
the $ 165 million animated film topped the chart with $ 49.1 million out of 3,752 theaters — the strongest debut ever for a @entity10 animation production ( i.e. , not including @entity17 titles )			1
@entity10 's " tangled " opened with a whopping $ 48.8 million over the more lucrative @entity18 weekend in 2010 , so " @entity9 's " slightly larger bow ( and its hefty $ 13,086 per theater average ) should be viewed as a major victory for the @entity22			1
now the studio is looking ahead not only to @entity18 , but @entity24 as well , both huge moviegoing seasons since kids are out of school and parents are off of work			0
" there really are few things for families in the time between now and then , " says @entity30 , @entity10 's executive vice president of domestic distribution , who cites @entity32 ' " @entity31 " and @entity10 's own @entity34 re-release of " @entity35 " as the only animated competition for the rest of 2012			1
" [ we ] have great word - of - mouth and a story that resonates , " @entity30 says			0
" we feel really good about where we 're headed for the rest of this run			0
" @entity10 has every right to feel good			2
" @entity9 " earned an " a " cinemascore grade from polled audiences , and very positive reactions will help the film hold up even better than a typical family film would anyway			0
the @entity54 - directed drama " flight " soared in second place with $ 25 million from just 1,884 theaters , giving the $ 31 million @entity59 film the strongest per theater average in the @entity61 , with $ 13,275			1
for star @entity62 , one of the few actors working today who can legitimately be called a box office draw , " flight " marks his second hit of 2012			1
his last picture , " @entity68 , " opened in february with $ 40.2 million on the way to a $ 126.2 million finish			0
while it remains to be seen whether " flight " will fly that high , a finish above $ 100 million certainly seems likely given the film 's strong reviews , awards buzz and " a- " @entity78 grade			1
fellow adult - targeting drama " @entity84 " opened substantially lower ( with $ 19.8 million ) in substantially more theaters ( 3,232 to be exact ) , and , as you 'll read in a moment , is headed past the $ 100 million mark thanks to slim declines			1
with better per - theater averages and room for expansion , " flight " should enjoy a similar fate			0
speaking of " @entity84 , " the @entity92 - helmed thriller finished in third place in its fourth weekend , dropping only 15 percent to $ 10.2 million ( anytime a film is still in double digits after four frames , you know it 's clicking with crowds )			1
that lifts its total to $ 75.9 million			0
@entity103 ' $ 45 million investment is proving to have been a smart one — the film is earning massive @entity107 buzz and will pass the $ 100 million mark in the next few weeks			0
that last @entity92 vehicle to gross $ 100 million was 2003 ′ s " @entity110 , " which earned $ 102.5 million			1
welcome back , @entity92 ! the martial arts picture " @entity112 " debuted in fourth place with $ 8.2 million — certainly not a knockout result , but in line with studio expectations considering @entity118 audiences have never consistently taken to flying daggers and karate chops			1
fortunately , @entity121 spent only $ 15 million on the film , which was directed by @entity123			0
the studio boasted producer @entity126 's name heavily in advertising , but audiences , which were 64 percent male and 53 percent below the age of 30 , did n't take the bait			0
those that did see the film were n't especially enthusiastic and issued " fists " a " c + " cinemascore grade			0
rounding out the top five was " taken 2 , " which fell 22 percent in its fifth frame to $ 6 million and has now grossed $ 125.7 million in @entity139			2
though @entity142 's $ 45 million sequel will finish a tad below the original " taken 's " $ 145 million domestic finish , it has more than made up for that fact overseas , where " taken 2 " has grossed $ 210.8 million ( the original " taken " found $ 81 million internationally )			1
all told , the @entity147 picture has grossed a tremendous $ 336.6 million worldwide			0
" @entity9 " -- $ 49.1 million 2			1
" flight " -- $ 25.0 million 3			1
" @entity84 " -- $ 10.2 million 4			2
" @entity112 " -- $ 8.2 million 5			0
" taken 2 " -- $ 6.0 million the biggest story at the box office this weekend , however , does n't have anything to do with the domestic chart			1
" @entity158 , " the 23rd @entity154 picture , grossed an incredible $ 156 million this weekend internationally , giving it a remarkable 10 - day total of $ 287 million — by far the best ever initial numbers for the @entity154 franchise			2
for perspective , " @entity162 , " which finished with $ 417 million internationally , did n't achieve that total until its fourth week of release			0
" @entity158 's " best market was once again the @entity164 , where it fell only 21 percent in its second frame to $ 25.7 million , good for an $ 85.8 million total			2
the film 's top new market was @entity169 , where it earned $ 23.9 million — the best opening of 2012 in that country			2
" @entity158 " debuts in the @entity118 next weekend , and taking into account how engaged the rest of the world seems to be by the film ( and taking into account its glowing reviews ) , it 's looking increasingly likely that " @entity158 " will score the best debut ever for a @entity154 film — perhaps in the $ 80 million range			2
