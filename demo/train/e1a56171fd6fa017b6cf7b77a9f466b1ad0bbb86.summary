@entity0 , @entity1 -- prosecutors are expected to rest their case friday in the seven - week - long trial of model @entity7 's boyfriend and two doctors			1
they are expected to call their last witness friday afternoon			1

@entity7 's boyfriend @entity13 and two doctors are on trial for allegedly conspiring to feed her drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs			1
one expert witness for the defense , a pain medications expert , has already testified for the defense			2
dr. @entity22 testified early because of scheduling issues			0
jurors watched a video on wednesday of the @entity27 model singing , kissing and bathing with her infant daughter just two months before her february 2007 death			2
" @entity33 did n't mean it , i 'm sorry , " @entity7 said when @entity31 began crying as she washed her face			2
prosecutors showed the 13 - minute video to support their argument that @entity7 's speech was slurred and her mind was groggy from drugs			1
the defense does not deny @entity7 took a lot of drugs , but they contend drs. @entity44 and @entity45 were treating her for chronic pain that other doctors had also diagnosed			1
" if she 's being treated for pain , it 's not illegal , " @entity49 judge @entity48 said last week			0
judge @entity48 has suggested several times in recent weeks that the prosecution had fallen short in proving the core of its case , including that @entity7 was a drug addict			1
the judge told the lawyers on monday that he was considering dropping some of the charges before the case goes to the jury			1
" i expect some charges will likely survive in some form , " @entity48 said			0
the three are charged with a conspiracy to provide drugs to a known addict and using false names on prescriptions for @entity7			2
they are not charged in her death , which a @entity73 medical examiner ruled was from an accidental overdose of a sleep aid , a lethal mix of prescription drugs and a viral flu			0
