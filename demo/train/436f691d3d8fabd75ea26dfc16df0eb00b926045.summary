-- historian @entity1 has written that the first @entity2 took place in @entity4 , @entity5			0
on may 1 , 1865 , a crowd of african - americans -- recently freed from slavery -- honored the @entity10 soldiers entombed in the rocky ground of the @entity12			2
twenty - nine days later , @entity13 concluded his farewell order from the @entity15 with the words , " your general now bids you farewell , with the full belief that , as in war you have been good soldiers , so in peace you will make good citizens			2
" on this @entity2 2014 , we must acknowledge , not as a member of @entity25 , a veteran of the @entity27 and a journalist - filmmaker , but as one nation indivisible , that @entity13 's hope for @entity32 soldiers is not being realized today			1
according to current @entity35 estimates , 22 @entity32 veterans take their lives every single day			1
high rates of unemployment , homelessness , alcoholism , substance abuse and post-traumatic stress are decimating our community of veterans			1
with the wars of the past 13 years in @entity46 and @entity47 coming to a close , we are seeing too many casualties among @entity32 soldiers in this transition to peace			1
in light of this crisis , we need a new kind of @entity2			0
many veterans are desperate to talk about their experiences with fellow @entity32 who accept shared responsibility for what is done in war , particularly the killing			1
yet these conversations rarely happen today			0
how can a veteran truly come home unless we acknowledge that our nation 's wars are something we all chose and paid for ? returning @entity27 veterans were treated shamefully			1
that , thankfully , is behind @entity32			1
we 've moved from outright hostility to awkward , if well - meant , expressions of " thank you for your service " and the creation of a number of new veterans services organizations			2
however , there remains an abiding sense of national indifference , or worse , a sense that somehow veterans are victims			2
there are more than 2 million @entity46 and @entity47 veterans in @entity32			1
that they are all proud volunteers does n't excuse us from helping them come home			0
yes , the @entity35 and other government services that cater to veterans need to work better , but there is an additional , crucial step that @entity32 must take : the entire nation must accept responsibility for the wounds , psychological and physical , that they bring home from war			1
opposing the recent wars does not exempt one from this responsibility any more than opposing national health care exempts one from having to take care of @entity32 's sick and injured			1
many veterans did n't see combat , but all were separated from their families for long periods and subjected to the enormous stresses of life in a war zone			2
ironically , a consequence is that veterans often feel excluded from the very society they helped defend			1
other cultures understood this obligation to help rebuild the bond between a returning warrior and his community			0
in early @entity119 cultures , a warrior back from battle participated in purification ceremonies intended to reaffirm his identity			0
these rituals also empowered the community to welcome the warrior home : to listen to his battle tales , to appreciate his sacrifice , and to assert his value in society			0
in our modern society , tribal rituals should give way to a concerted , national effort to share in the stories of our fighting men and women			0
pomp and circumstance are fine , but what our veterans really need is a solemn commemoration that the wars of the past 13 years -- wars waged by all of us -- are over			0
our veterans also need public forums in which to tell their stories			0
our soldiers ' stories are visceral , and sometimes repugnant , and their telling can close the widening gap that exists between our military and the rest of @entity32 society			1
we are either one nation or we 're not			0
we ca n't have it both ways			0
this is what future @entity159 in @entity32 could mean to us all			2
whether through community forums , statewide listening tours or action at the federal level , a national embrace of our veterans ' experiences is a profound way to combat today 's veterans ' crisis			2
each and every @entity32 must make a commitment to help return our soldiers to society : cleansed , rehabilitated , welcomed , and empowered			1
our soldiers deserve a @entity2 2.0			0
and , as we help our veterans navigate their paths of reconciliation and reintegration , we may become better citizens ourselves			0
we may also find that the answers to many of @entity32 's most pressing challenges are found in the pain and pride , the tragedies and triumphs , of @entity32 soldiers .			1

writers : @entity32 is not fulfilling promise to soldiers to help them on their return to society
they say veterans *adrift* face unemployment , homelessness , substance abuse , *suicide*
they say many cultures see embrace of veterans as *critical* . all @entity32 should , too
writers : we must be one nation , together with our veterans , help them reintegrate , reconcile
