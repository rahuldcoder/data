this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : today , we are exploring the connection between your education and your community 's economy			1
thank you for spending part of your thursday with @entity0			0
first up : quake update @entity26 : massive devastation , severe loss of life , uncertainty about what to do or where to go : that is what is facing survivors of tuesday 's deadly earthquake in @entity5			1
the @entity38 island nation is home to around 9 million people			0
the @entity41 says that one out of every three of those residents was affected by this quake			0
yesterday , @entity5 's president told @entity0 that it was too early to know how many people had died in the tremor , although he had heard reports ranging from 30,000 to 100,000			1
to make matters worse , he said it 's difficult to help people who have been injured because many hospitals were destroyed by the earthquake			1
several @entity5 officials have said that all of @entity4 , the capital city , is either damaged or destroyed			1
the quake struck about 10 miles from the city			0
one @entity0 reporter on the scene described the devastation as " horrifying and disturbing			1
" in downtown @entity4 , he said , " block after block after block , there is not one building			0
" the country 's president is calling on the international community for aid , saying , " we need doctors , we need medicine , we need medical help			1
" the @entity80 , along with nations from @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , as well as global relief agencies -- all of them have already begun sending relief workers and assistance to @entity5			1
president @entity83 has pledged that @entity78 will have a major role in the relief efforts			0
@entity80 president @entity83 : the people of @entity5 will have the full support of the @entity80 in the urgent effort to rescue those trapped beneath the rubble and to deliver the humanitarian relief : the food , water and medicine that @entity5 will need in the coming days			1
@entity26 : @entity5 is part of the island of @entity97 , along with the @entity98			1
and that island has a fault line that runs along its southern side			0
that 's why scientists have warned that @entity97 was at risk for a major earthquake			1
@entity5 itself is a little smaller than the state of @entity108			1
it 's the poorest country in the @entity109			1
80 percent of its population lives under the poverty line , and that economic situation might create additional challenges as the country tries to recover from this natural disaster			0
impact your world @entity26 : that recovery process : likely to be long and difficult			0
we 've already mentioned that several countries and agencies have launched relief efforts			0
but if you want to get involved , head to the @entity127 section at @entity128 and click on the " @entity130 " link			0
you 're going to find a list of organizations that can use your help			2
word to the @entity135 @entity136 , @entity14 : a word to the @entity135 ... censorship ( noun ) the act of deleting or restricting something @entity141 v. @entity6 @entity26 : @entity141 has been practicing self - censorship for years in @entity6			1
when the internet giant first started operating in the communist country -- that was in 2006 -- @entity6 's government demanded that some search results be restricted			1
@entity141 said okay , arguing that it was providing at least some information to @entity6 citizens			1
but now , the company is changing its policy			0
@entity151 explains why and what it might mean for @entity141 's future in the world 's most populated country			1
( begin video ) @entity151 , @entity158 , @entity159 : after all the self - censorship , the government web crackdowns , after compromising its own stated ethics , @entity141 , it seems , has finally had enough of doing business the @entity6 way			1
@entity166 , @entity167 : @entity141 has been subject to inordinate amount of harassment in @entity6 over the last year			1
@entity170 : the tipping point , it seems , is what the internet giant calls " sophisticated " cyber attacks originating from within @entity6 , targeting gmail accounts of @entity6 human rights activists			1
none were breached , but the company says the attacks " ... have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in @entity6 , " and it 's " ... no longer willing to continue censoring our results on @entity184			1
" this may well mean having to shut down @entity184 and potentially our offices in @entity6			1
" @entity187 : i imagine the @entity6 government 's reaction is going to be well , if you do n't like our laws , get lost			1
@entity170 : within hours of the announcement , the self - censorship was being rolled back			1
search results from @entity141 's @entity6 server showed images of the 1989 crackdown on @entity200			1
so too , the @entity201 and the outlawed religious group @entity203			0
for a company with " do n't do evil " as its motto , this defiant new stand one praise from supporters of free speech , who in the past have been critical of @entity141 for agreeing to government censorship as a condition for setting up shop in @entity6			1
@entity215 , @entity216 : they 've revisited the idea of censorship and are now saying that the price they 're paying is perhaps too high			2
@entity170 : if @entity141 really does pull out of @entity6 , it could come with huge financial cost			1
this country has more than 300 million internet users , more than any other , and the internet advertising market here is seen as one of the most important and fastest growing in the world			0
@entity141 has not directly accused the @entity6 government of being involved in the cyber attacks and says it will seek negotiations with @entity159 over the next few weeks to see if it 's possible to continue to operate here			1
@entity6 government officials declined to comment when asked by @entity0			1
meantime , all @entity159 @entity141 staff are now reportedly on paid leave			1
@entity151 , @entity0 , @entity159			0
( @entity235 ) @entity236 @entity26 : in @entity239 , a commission set up by @entity238 is investigating the @entity80 financial crisis			0
they 're looking into what caused it and hopefully how to avoid another one in the future			2
as part of that investigation , the commission has been talking with some government officials			0
and yesterday , it met with the chief executives of four of the country 's biggest banks			2
the head of the commission said he wanted to hear the bankers talk about their companies ' roles in causing the crisis			0
the executives acknowledged that their banks had made mistakes , but said they did n't realize how bad those mistakes were at the time			0
@entity263 @entity264 , @entity14 : time for the shoutout ! what percent of @entity80 students earn their high school diploma ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) 50 percent , b ) 70 percent , c ) 85 percent or @entity275 ) 95 percent ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! only 70 percent of students earn their high school diplomas			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! dropout @entity281 @entity26 : okay , that number may surprise you			2
another thing you might not realize is that getting your high school diploma can help many more people than just you			0
a new study looked at how communities would 've benefited if more people stayed in school			2
take a look at what it found out			0
( begin video ) @entity26 : soaring unemployment , states trying to avoid running out of money : could students dropping out of high school actually make this worse ? absolutely , says the @entity299			2
the group 's been analyzing the effects that dropouts have , not only on themselves , but on the places where they live , and they found that just getting a high school diploma can dramatically affect communities			1
here 's how the study worked : an estimated 600,000 students dropped out of the class of 2008			1
the @entity299 figured out how the country could 've benefited if just half of them , 300,000 , had gotten their diplomas			2
it estimated they would 've earned a combined $ 4.1 billion more money in an average year			0
then , they could 've spent $ 2.8 billion more and invested more than $ 1 billion more			0
so what ? well , all that additional spending could 've supported 30,000 more jobs ; you know we could use them now			0
and down the road , these hypothetical graduates could 've bought homes valued at $ 10.5 billion more than what they 'd have spent without diplomas			2
and they 'd probably have the money to spend $ 340 million more on cars			0
with the taxes that come with all that spending , the @entity299 estimates that states and communities would be pulling in an extra $ 536 million a year			1
and the point ? to show how getting a diploma does n't just help students , it helps the country			2
@entity341 , @entity0 business news correspondent : right now , there are 7,000 kids , estimated , that drop out of school every day			2
the @entity299 president says this report underscores the notion that the best economic stimulus package is a high school diploma			0
@entity26 : another reason why all this means so much			0
( @entity235 ) @entity354 @entity26 : all right , when you get home today , we want you to go to @entity359 / @entity358			2
we 've got a new video up			0
you 're going to love it			0
you 've got to check it out			0
it 's at @entity359 / @entity358			2
and if you 're not a fan of our show , that 's where you can click the button to become a fan			2
we 'd love to have you			0
looking forward to seeing you there ! before we go @entity26 : before we go , a couple who 's trashing their wedding plans , ' cause that 's how they plan to pay for the big day : with trash ! cans , to be specific			2
the bride - to - be said she got the idea in the middle of the night : collect 400,000 aluminum cans , recycle them , and then use the money to cover the cost of the wedding			2
they 've collected more than 10,000 so far , with a web site and @entity354 page helping the cause			0
goodbye @entity26 : we 're sure they can meet their goal			0
if not , they can just postpone the wedding for a while and recycle the idea down the road			0
a fresh @entity0 with a fresh pun is coming your way tomorrow			0
we 'll see you then .			0
