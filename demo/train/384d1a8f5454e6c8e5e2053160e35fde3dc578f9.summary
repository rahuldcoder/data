-- @entity2 plans to continue using a controversial subsea dispersant to break up a plume of oil gushing into the @entity6 , saying that the leading alternative could pose a risk over the long term , the @entity1 indicated saturday			1
the @entity1 issued a directive on thursday , ordering @entity2 to find , within 24 hours , a less toxic but equally effective chemical than its current product , @entity13 -- and one that is available in sufficient quantities			1
the directive also gave the company 72 hours to stop applying it to the undersea gusher			0
@entity13 has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 @entity1 - approved dispersants , according to testimony at a congressional hearing wednesday			1
the @entity1 released @entity2 's response to the mandate on saturday			2
the response , which @entity2 submitted late thursday night , said that the oil company identified the only other effective , less toxic alternative available in mass quantities as @entity29 4			1
however , @entity2 said the @entity29 product " contains a small amount of a chemical that may degrade to a nonylphenol			1
" @entity34 is an organic chemical that is toxic to aquatic life and may persist in the environment for years			0
@entity13 , however , " does not contain chemicals that degrade into @entity40 [ and ] the manufacturer indicates that @entity13 reaches its maximum biodegradeablility within 28 days of application " and does not persist in the environment , @entity2 's response said			2
" based on the information that is available today , @entity2 continues to believe that @entity13 was the best and most appropriate choice at the time when the incident occurred , and that @entity13 remains the best option for subsea application , " @entity2 said			2
despite the continuing use of @entity13 , @entity2 is not in violation of the @entity1 directive , which said that should the company not be able to identify alternative products , " @entity2 shall provide ... a detailed description of the products investigated [ and ] the reason the products did not meet the standards " required by the agency			1
" we will continue to review and discuss the science through the end of the 72 - hour window on sunday , and then we will reach a decision , " an @entity1 spokesman said saturday			0
@entity66 , president of @entity67 , which manufactures @entity29 , took issue with @entity2 's response , saying saturday that the company is " nitpicking my product because they want to use what they 've always used			0
" @entity66 told @entity0 that he discussed the nonylphenol issue with @entity1 officials earlier this week , saying the chemical makes up less than 1 percent of the @entity29 dispersant			1
" i 've already diffused this issue with the @entity1 , " he said , adding the agency " accepted that response days ago			0
" the @entity1 has not yet publicly issued a formal response to @entity2 's letter			2
@entity1 officials met with @entity2 executives on friday to discuss the issue and to explore alternatives			0
the @entity1 said saturday that it " will continue to work over the next 48 hours to ensure @entity2 is complying with the directive , " but did not respond to requests for additional comment			1
meanwhile , the @entity88 announced saturday that interior secretary @entity89 and homeland security secretary @entity90 will lead a bipartisan @entity92 delegation to inspect the @entity94 coastline after globs of thick , heavy oil began washing into some of the state 's marshlands this week			0
the delegation will meet with federal officials and @entity2 representatives to discuss the ongoing response efforts			0
@entity0 's @entity103 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 says it " will continue to work over the next 48 hours to ensure @entity2 is complying "
@entity1 issued directive to find less toxic chemical than @entity13 , the current dispersant in use
@entity2 says only other less toxic alternative is @entity29 4 , which may " degrade to a nonylphenol "
@entity2 *maintains* " @entity13 was the best and most appropriate choice "
