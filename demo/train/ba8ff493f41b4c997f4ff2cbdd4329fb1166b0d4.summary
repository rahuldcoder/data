@entity0 -- the deaths of 16 children aged five and six together with their teacher in the @entity7 town of @entity8 in 1996 was one of @entity11 's worst incidents of gun - related violence			1
the massacre stunned the country , but what did the @entity11 do to try to prevent such a tragedy happening again ? what happened at @entity8 ? shortly after 9 a.m. on march 13 , 1996 , @entity18 , a 43 - year - old former scout leader , burst into the gymnasium of a primary school in the tranquil @entity7 town of @entity8			1
within minutes 15 children aged five and six had died in a hail of bullets			0
one died later in hospital			0
their teacher , @entity28 mayor , a 44 - year - old mother of two , died in the attack , reportedly while trying to shield her pupils			1
two other teachers were also seriously injured while heroically trying to protect children			0
@entity18 turned one of his four handguns on himself and was found dead at the scene			0
tennis star @entity37 , who grew up in @entity8 , was present during the attack at his school , but normally refuses to speak about his experience			1
he posted this tribute during the weekend on his website : " my heart goes out to all those poor children , their families and the community in @entity47 in @entity48 , so so sad			1
" in his autobiography " hitting back , " @entity37 recalled how as an eight - year - old boy he was walking to the gymnasium when shooting broke out			1
a teacher led him and his classmates into the headteacher 's study where they took refuge			2
" some of my friends ' brothers and sisters were killed			2
i have only retained patch impressions of that day , such as being in a classroom singing songs			0
the weirdest thing was that we knew the guy [ @entity18 ]			0
he had been in my mum 's car			0
it 's obviously weird to think you had a murderer in your car , sitting next to your mum			0
" who was @entity18 ? many local people said @entity18 was an oddball -- a loner obsessed with guns and young boys , someone who did n't fit into society			1
he was reported to have held a grudge against the scouting movement and his local community after police questioned him about inappropriate behavior to boys in his care			0
@entity88 , secretary of a local shooting club that rejected @entity18 for membership , described him as " sleazy			0
" " he was just one of these people that you got a gut feeling about ... did n't like -- or at least i did n't particularly like him , " @entity88 said			1
nevertheless , @entity18 held a permit to own handguns , possibly including the ones he used at @entity8			1
what was the reaction to the massacre ? the massacre , one of the worst incidents of gun violence in @entity11 , had a massive impact in @entity7 , the rest of the @entity11 and around the world			1
" this is a slaughter of the innocents , unlike anything we have ever seen in @entity7 , and i think @entity7 is going to have to come to terms with it , " said @entity7 mp @entity107 at the time			0
after the massacre , appalled residents of @entity8 and bereaved relatives demanded to know how a person like @entity18 could be allowed to own guns			1
a highly successful public campaign in the months after @entity8 against gun ownership culminated in a petition being handed to the government with almost 750,000 signatures , according to @entity11 media reports			1
in response , then @entity126 prime minister @entity125 set up a public inquiry to look into gun laws and assess ways to better protect the public			2
what happened next ? in the wake of the 1987 @entity135 massacre , in which one lone gunman killed 16 people , @entity11 introduced new legislation -- the @entity139 -- making registration mandatory for owning shotguns and banning semi-automatic and pump - action weapons			1
within a year and a half of the @entity8 massacre , @entity11 lawmakers had passed a ban on the private ownership of all handguns in mainland @entity11 , giving the country some of the toughest anti-gun legislation in the world			1
after both shootings there were firearm amnesties across the @entity11 , resulting in the surrender of thousands of firearms and rounds of ammunition			2
@entity11 has never had a " gun culture " like that of the @entity166 , but there were about 200,000 legally - registered handguns in @entity11 before the ban , most owned by sports shooters			1
all small - bore pistols , including the .22 caliber , were included in the ban , along with rifles used by target shooters			2
penalties for anyone found in possession of illegal firearms range from heavy fines to prison terms of up to 10 years			0
" it was one of the most shocking things that has ever happened in this country and it united the country in a feeling that we had to do something , " @entity178 , of the @entity179 , told @entity1			0
" and i do n't think that it would have been possible to make the kind of progress that we have made without that tragedy			0
" the public generally supported the ban , with most saying they saw no need for guns			1
however , others complained bitterly that the ban deprived legitimate sports shooters of their hobby and demonized them			2
" just because we enjoy shooting does n't mean that we think everybody should be free to go into any shop on any street corner and buy a gun without having some suitable checks , " firearms expert @entity202 , spokesman for @entity11 's @entity203 , said at the time			1
" there is obviously a balanced position			0
what we do n't like is being scapegoated			0
" anyone who has any expert knowledge in this field realizes that a simplistic ban , bureaucratic ban on one category of firearm , was never going to solve a real world problem , " @entity202 said			2
" but that 's what 's happened , and what we 're going to see is handgun crime will continue as ever			2
" what effect did the ban have ? according to bare statistics , the ban initially appeared to have little impact , as the number of crimes involving guns in @entity233 and @entity234 rose heavily during the late 1990s to peak at 24,094 offenses in 2003/04			2
since then the number has fallen in each year			0
in 2010/11 there were 11,227 offenses , 53 % below the peak number , according to the official crime figures			0
crimes involving handguns also fell 44 % -- from 5,549 in 2002/03 to 3,105 -- in 2010/11			0
despite this , the effectiveness of @entity11 's gun laws has been repeatedly questioned			1
the most high - profile mass shooting happened in 2010 when a lone gunman killed 12 people in a four - hour shooting spree in rural @entity250 , northern @entity233			1
after a huge manhunt , the body of 52 - year - old taxi driver @entity252 was found alongside two powerful rifles , one equipped with a telescopic sight			0
criminologist @entity256 said the real picture shows a slight but significant decline in the use of firearms since @entity8			2
the figures do n't tell the whole story , he said , but " the murder rate has fallen and all the indicators are moving in the right direction			0
" @entity256 , professor of criminology at @entity266 and a member of the @entity179 , said he believed the fall in crimes where guns were used was due to new legislation coupled with better policing against gangs			2
" any weapon can be misused in a crime			0
gun control will never be a complete solution to events like the mass shooting we saw in @entity48			1
the swamp of gun use has not been fully drained and while tighter gun control removes risk on an incremental basis , significant numbers of weapons remain in @entity11			1
" he added it was important to note that a big problem remained in @entity11 and other countries with imitation guns , converted weapons such as starting pistols and air guns , " which many people regard as only one step up from a toy			1
