@entity0 , @entity1 -- the murder trial of @entity8 , the wife of a recently deposed top official in the @entity6 , has begun in the eastern @entity1 city of @entity0 , local officials said thursday			1
@entity8 and a family aide , @entity11 , are accused of poisoning @entity12 , a @entity13 businessman who was found dead in the southwestern @entity1 metropolis of @entity15 in november			1
the trial is the latest phase in the fall from grace of the prominent family of @entity20 , @entity8 's husband , who until earlier this year had appeared destined to join the elite committee of leaders at the top of @entity1 's ruling party			1
the saga has become the most sensational @entity1 political scandal in recent years , creating an extraordinary set of challenges for the central government as it prepares for a once - in - a - decade leadership transition later this year			0
@entity12 , a 41 - year - old @entity13 citizen , was found dead in a hotel in @entity15 , the city where @entity20 was the @entity6 chief			1
but the trial is taking place in @entity0 , in @entity36 province , more than 1,200 kilometers ( 750 miles ) east of @entity15 , where lingering support for @entity20 and his family remains			1
" this is definitely more than a criminal trial , " said @entity39 , a professor of political science at the @entity41			2
he added that the process is being closely watched for signs of what might happen to @entity20 , who is being investigated for " serious discipline violations " after being removed from his @entity15 and party posts			1
@entity8 's family had wanted to hire two prominent @entity52 lawyers to represent her , but @entity1 authorities have chosen two local attorneys to form her defense team , a family friend told @entity2 on wednesday			1
the family is sending one of the attorneys -- along with another well - known @entity52 attorney -- into the courtroom as observers , with the approval of the court , said the friend , who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the case			2
the cards appear to be stacked against @entity8 and @entity11 , who are at the mercy of a @entity1 court system that has been criticized by human rights advocates as being little more than a tool of the country 's powerful state security apparatus			1
" in this trial , frankly speaking , nobody believes that it 's a totally independent judiciary and it will be judged just on the merits of the case , " @entity39 said			2
" it has been managed by the most senior level of leadership at every step			0
" the defendants have n't seen their relatives since they were arrested in early april , a friend of @entity8 's family said last week			1
@entity20 has not been seen in public since he was stripped of his titles			1
when the murder charges were announced last month , @entity88 , the state - run news agency , reported that " the facts of the two defendants ' crime are clear , and the evidence is irrefutable and substantial			0
" if convicted , the two could face the death penalty			0
the @entity88 report said that @entity8 and the couple 's son , @entity98 , had " conflicts " with @entity12 " over economic interests			1
" it alleged that @entity8 and @entity11 had poisoned the @entity103 because @entity8 was worried that he was " threat to her son 's personal security			1
" international media reports have speculated about the nature of @entity12 's work in @entity1 and his ties to the @entity112			0
he had lived in @entity1 for more than a decade and was married to a @entity1 woman			0
among the companies he advised was a consulting firm founded by former officers of the @entity13 spy agency @entity117			2
@entity98 , 24 , said in an e-mail tuesday that he had submitted a witness statement to the defense team for his mother			0
" i have faith that facts will speak for themselves , " wrote @entity20 , who graduated from @entity123 's @entity122 in may			1
he previously attended @entity126 , graduating in 2010			0
his illustrious education is an indication of the influence and ambitions of his family , which is now engulfed by scandal			0
as the son of @entity135 , one the " eight immortals " of the revolution that created modern @entity1 , @entity20 was considered a strong contender for promotion into the @entity138 of the party 's @entity139 , whose nine members decide how to run @entity1			1
he stood out as one of @entity1 's most dynamic and controversial politicians , notably for his populist policies in @entity15 that promoted @entity6 culture and aimed to crack down on organized crime			0
@entity8 is also descended from a revolutionary hero : maj. gen. @entity150 , a prominent military figure			2
fluent in @entity153 , she is a lawyer who took a leading role in a legal battle in the @entity157 involving several @entity1 firms			0
she eventually won the lawsuit for the @entity1 companies and later wrote a book about it			0
as well as being involved in her most notable professional triumph , the @entity157 has also played a role in her undoing			0
the case she is now facing may never have come to light had it not been for an extraordinary series of actions by @entity172 , @entity20 's longtime lieutenant			1
officials had quickly blamed @entity12 's death on excessive alcohol consumption , and his body was cremated without an autopsy			2
but on february 6 , @entity172 , the former police chief who had run the anti-crime push in @entity15 that helped to build @entity20 's reputation , sought refuge at the @entity157 @entity181 in nearby @entity182			1
he wanted political asylum and apparently feared for his life			0
media reports and online posts have claimed that he had clashed with @entity20 after suggesting that @entity12 had been poisoned amid a business dispute with @entity8			1
he gave information about @entity12 's death to @entity157 officials before he left the consulate and was taken into custody by @entity1 security forces			2
the @entity13 government was made aware of @entity172 's comments and made a formal request to the @entity1 authorities to investigate the case on february 15			1
a month later , @entity88 announced that @entity20 had been removed as party secretary of @entity15			2
and less than a month after that , @entity8 and @entity11 were arrested			2
the case has forced the @entity6 leadership to confront allegations of wrongdoing by a high - ranking member in an unusually public way , according to @entity207 , a top @entity1 analyst at the @entity208 in @entity209			0
" the disruption of his departure from office and his wife 's crimes have made it difficult to present a facade of unity to their people , " @entity207 said			0
that united front has been key to ruling @entity1 for 2,000 years , he said			0
the current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining it since 1989 , when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with the pro-democracy demonstrations in @entity52 's @entity228			0
@entity2 's @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 , and journalist @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
