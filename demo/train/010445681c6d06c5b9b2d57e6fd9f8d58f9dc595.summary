@entity0 poured into the streets thursday to celebrate the death of @entity3			1
after months of intense fighting , rebel fighters finally overran @entity3 's last stronghold in his hometown of @entity8 , marking the end of his 42 - year rule			2
although @entity3 's rule effectively ended two months ago when he fled @entity13 , his death provides closure and a sense of relief to many in the country who had opposed his tyrannical rule			2
it also greatly reduces the likelihood of a prolonged insurgency by @entity3 loyalists and allows the transitional government to move forward with the hard work of building a new political system			2
the challenges ahead are great : since the @entity3 regime so effectively monopolized the public sphere , @entity0 has no real civil society or effective political institutions			1
after decades of tyranny , there is a deep distrust of government			2
there is also fear of revenge killings by those who suffered under @entity3 's brutality			2
tensions are already evident between @entity43 and secularists , and between technocrats returning from abroad and those who stayed and opposed the regime at enormous personal expense			0
well - armed militias have yet to be formally disbanded or integrated into a national army ; large caches of arms , including some sophisticated missiles , are not accounted for and could end up in the hands of extremists			0
nevertheless , of all the @entity56 states that have been convulsed by revolts this year , @entity0 has by far the strongest economic prospects			1
its relatively small population of 6.5 million and vast oil wealth give it the best chance of meeting the economic aspirations of its citizens			1
just recently , the transitional government announced that it had discovered an additional $ 23 billion in the @entity67 , enough to cover the costs of government for at least six months			1
it has an additional $ 160 billion in foreign assets , which are frozen overseas but will eventually be released			1
@entity0 also has a relatively well - educated population			1
public education was free and compulsory through secondary school under @entity3 , and the country enjoys a literacy rate of nearly 90 %			1
in the 2007 - 2008 school year , women enrolled in universities outnumbered men significantly			0
according to the @entity83 constitution , legislative and presidential elections to form a new government must be held within a year of liberation			0
the constitution also stipulates that no member of the council can participate in this newly elected government , a provision meant to limit the influence of the interim body			0
so far , transitional leaders seem willing to abide by that provision , but jockeying for power has only just begun			0
interim prime minister @entity94 , @entity95 educated and unabashedly secular , announced recently that he would step down at the close of the fighting , but it is not clear if he will follow through on his promise , or if he does , who will succeed him			2
@entity94 and @entity101 , the acting finance and oil minister who was teaching economics in the @entity95 before joining the rebellion , have been criticized for being outsiders , too secular and too connected to remnants of the former regime			0
some are pointing to @entity110 , the @entity83 commander of the militia in @entity13 , as a major player in the future political field			0
@entity110 was arrested in 2004 by the @entity114 and rendered to @entity0 , where he was held and tortured in the infamous @entity115			1
the warrant for his arrest accused him of ties to @entity119 , which he has denied			0
@entity110 has also disavowed extremism and pledged tolerance			0
islamists will undoubtedly play an influential role in @entity0 's new government , and outward signs of @entity43 piety , suppressed under @entity3 , are now on the rise across the country			1
but leaders across the political spectrum continue to insist on moderation and tolerance			0
@entity134 , chairman of the transitional council , has called for a @entity0 state founded on @entity137 that is also inclusive of women and minorities			1
@entity95 and @entity141 support for the rebels over the past seven months generated positive feelings among @entity0 for @entity145 countries , which points to a possible @entity147 - aligned @entity0 government that is nonetheless markedly @entity43 in character			1
@entity3 's death marks an important moment of transition for @entity0			1
reconciliation and integration will be imperative at this point , especially as the dust of war clears and evidence emerges of brutality committed by both rebel forces and @entity3 loyalists			0
as demonstrated painfully in @entity162 , lasting stability requires opportunities for @entity3 supporters to participate in the new order , but with war wounds still fresh , this will require remarkable leadership and forbearance on the part of transitional leaders			2
a stable , prosperous @entity0 undergoing a process of democratization will enhance the chance of successful transitions in neighboring @entity175 and @entity176			1
this helps explain the sense of jubilation across the region that erupted on the news of @entity3 's death			0
the era of tyrants seems to be coming to an end			0
protesters in @entity186 and @entity187 held out signs asking their leaders if they want to go the same violent way .			0

@entity192 : @entity0 best positioned economically of @entity194 nations
she says the population is well educated , with literacy rate near 90 $
@entity0 has billions in the bank and more money in frozen foreign assets
@entity204 : new leadership is *unclear* and transition may be rocky
