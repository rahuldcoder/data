at the start of a big week for the @entity3 , the most sought - after particle in all of physics , scientists in @entity1 said monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion			1
the scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the @entity11 @entity14 's @entity13 collider near @entity15 , @entity1 , whose budgetary woes shut it down last year			1
what is the @entity3 and why is it important ? their announcement came two days before researchers at the @entity23 under the @entity24 are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the @entity28 particle physics laboratory in @entity29 , @entity30			1
" our data strongly point toward the existence of the @entity3 , " @entity31 , a spokesman for one of two independent experiments at the @entity13 , said in a statement			1
" but it will take results from the experiments at the @entity23 in @entity40 to establish a discovery			0
" read more : the woman at the edge of physics finding the @entity3 would help explain the origin of mass , one of the open questions in physicists ' current understanding of the way the universe works			1
the particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist @entity54 reportedly wanted to call his book " @entity55			0
" but he truncated that epithet to " @entity55 , " which may have helped elevate the particle 's allure in popular culture			0
more science news from @entity62 @entity61 the results from the @entity13 , stemming from the two different experiments , suggest that if the @entity3 does exist , it would have a mass between 115 and 135 gev -- about 130 times the mass of the proton			1
before the @entity13 closed , the experiments there sent beams of particles whizzing around a four - mile circumference in opposite directions			2
traveling at a fraction below the speed of light , the particles would crash into each other , creating conditions similar to those at the dawn of the universe for scientists to observe			0
but so far , neither the results from the @entity11 collider experiments nor from the the @entity23 , located 328 feet underneath the border of @entity85 and @entity30 , have enough statistical significance to constitute a discovery			1
" it is easier to look for a friend 's face in a sports stadium filled with 100,000 people than to search for a @entity3 - like event among trillions of collisions , " said @entity88 , a physicist at the @entity11 facility			2
attention now turns to the latest analysis of data from the $ 10 billion @entity40 machine , the world 's most powerful particle smasher			2
" we now have more than double the data we had last year , " @entity104 , the director for research and computing at @entity28 , said last month			0
" that should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the 2011 data are still there , or whether they 've gone away			0
it 's a very exciting time			0
" scientists getting clearer picture of ' @entity117 particle '			0

@entity11 - based scientists say their data points toward the existence of the @entity3
finding the @entity3 would help explain the origin of mass
but the research at the @entity13 collider does *n't* provide a conclusive answer
attention now turns to a seminar *wednesday* on data from the @entity23
