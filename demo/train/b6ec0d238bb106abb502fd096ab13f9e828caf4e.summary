how should football tackle racism ? an incident - packed second half saw @entity4 lose @entity30 for a second yellow , but a goal from @entity33 gave them renewed hope against the nervy hosts			2
however , a late double from @entity38 and a further strike from @entity40 saw the @entity42 runners - up romp home in spectacular style			0
they were joined in the finals , as expected , by the @entity47 , who drew 1 - 1 with @entity49 to seal a 5 - 1 aggregate victory after a decisive four - goal win friday 's first leg			2
the @entity53 -- whose only previous appearance in the finals of a @entity57 was in 1988 -- opened the scoring through @entity59 after 32 minutes			0
@entity49 's @entity60 equalized in the second half with a long - range shot which eluded goalkeeper @entity63			0
