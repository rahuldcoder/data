-- @entity1 came from a goal down to beat @entity3 2 - 1 at @entity4 and open up a commanding lead at the top of the @entity7 saturday			1
@entity9 international @entity8 scored the winning goal midway through the second half after a much improved @entity3 took an early lead and can count themselves unlucky after having a goal disallowed and strong claims for a penalty waved way			1
two coaches , two stories both coaches had publicly aired their frustrations about recent performances before the match , albeit for very different reasons			0
@entity1 coach @entity24 has seen his side dominate this season 's @entity7 whilst playing at a canter			1
but he was critical of @entity1 's past few performances , especially this week 's lackluster draw against @entity31 champions @entity30 in the @entity32			1
@entity3 coach @entity33 has far deeper problems to deal with			1
after coming so close to winning the title last season with a rampant @entity37 , @entity3 has endured a slow start as new signings like @entity40 and @entity42 struggle to settle in			1
but it was @entity33 's decision to rest key players against @entity46 in the @entity32 that had provoked a storm of criticism			0
@entity3 lost that game 1 - 0 , with a much improved performance , which some saw as a sort of vindication for @entity33			1
yes we can so it was with some surprise that only one player drafted in for that game at the @entity57 kept their place , a move that paid almost immediate dividends			2
after a fast paced , high quality opening exchange , @entity62 midfielder @entity61 drifted in and fired @entity3 into the lead after his shot took a wicked deflection off @entity67			1
@entity67 would soon get his chance to make amends after smuggling home a lose ball following a @entity1 free kick into the penalty area			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity74 managed to get something on the shot before taking it over the line			1
from the naked eye it would have been almost impossible to see whether the ball had crossed the line			0
but within seconds referee @entity82 had given the goal thanks to newly - introduced goal line technology			1
chances both teams had chances -- @entity40 had the ball in the back of the net but it was ruled offside -- before @entity1 began to take control of the game and @entity8 fired home after good work by @entity96 on the left			1
yet @entity3 will count themselves unlucky not to have won a penalty after @entity67 was again involved in another controversial moment in the game			1
replays showed that he clearly handled the ball in the penalty area			0
@entity3 captain @entity103 -- whose slip in the corresponding fixture last season effectively ended @entity3 's title chase -- was apoplectic that a penalty had not been given , but to no avail			1
a " clear " penalty " it was a clear one , " @entity33 told @entity111 after the game			2
" we worked so hard in the game , we need those decisions			2
it hits his hand , it was a clear , clear penalty , and the referee has a clear view of it			0
the players gave everything and we deserved at least a point			0
" a typically modest @entity127 , on the other hand , focused on @entity1 's fine performance away from home , claiming that the penalty incident was " too far for me " to see			1
" the victory is very much deserved , " he added			0
" i know that some people say that @entity3 did n't play so well			2
they tried everything , but @entity1 was the best team			2
" @entity1 extend lead , briefly the win saw @entity1 extend its lead at the top of the @entity7 to seven points , but only briefly			1
second place @entity140 beat @entity142 2 - 0 to cut @entity1 's lead back to four			1
the @entity140 have been the @entity7 's surprise package this season , going on an incredible run winning 25 out of an available 33 points under new coach @entity148			0
elsewhere another @entity149 enjoyed a good day at the office			0
@entity152 's rebuilding of @entity153 continued with a narrow 1 - 0 victory against @entity155			2
@entity9 international @entity156 scored the only goal of the game after coming off the bench			2
@entity161 v @entity160 in the final @entity7 game of the day , the champions @entity162 took on lowly @entity164 in west @entity165 amid torrential rain			0
and it was a torrid first half that saw @entity164 have two goals disallowed within a minute , both by the same player			0
whilst striker @entity161 's first was rightly disallowed for offside , the second was more controversial			0
from the resulting free kick from the first disallowed goal , @entity162 goalkeeper @entity160 passed the ball straight to @entity175 who slotted the ball home again			0
but the goal was ruled out thanks to an obscure , but correct , reading of the rules			0
an official had spotted that @entity160 had accidentally kicked the ball twice , with the first touch not leaving the penalty area			0
it meant the ball was not technically in play leaving the @entity189 crowd collectively stunned			0
a few minutes later @entity161 made it third time lucky when he finally broke the deadlock and put @entity164 into a well deserved league			0
@entity7 top scorer @entity194 leveled the score , despite being both offside and handling the ball in the build up , before a late @entity198 own goal appeared to have handed @entity164 an unlikely victory			0
but @entity194 scored his second of the game and secured @entity162 a point .			2

@entity1 beats @entity3 2 - 1 at @entity4 .
@entity8 scores winning goal of the game .
deflected @entity61 shot had given @entity3 lead .
@entity1 opens seven point league lead .
