@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the gravesite in a northern @entity1 village , there are no religious or traditional burial rites			1
no ceremony , no mourning , no family members , and no final goodbyes			0
nothing but a group of men dressed in space - suit - like outfits , cautiously throwing the dead body into the grave , they pause only to toss in anything else they are wearing that came into contact with the deceased			2
these men are part of the country 's ebola response team , specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the ebola virus			2
the virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of people infected with @entity28 , and it is still transferable even from a dead body			1
to help combat the spread of the disease , the @entity1 government has directed that its citizens should not bury anyone who dies of , or is suspected of having been infected with , @entity28			1
for months @entity1 ignored the directive , fearing that they would be ostracized by their communities if they admitted that their relatives had died of @entity28 , but here in @entity45 -- ground zero of the country 's outbreak -- almost everyone has witnessed the devastating suffering and numerous deaths caused by the virus			1
now almost anytime there is a suspected @entity28 death in the community , they call in the @entity28 response team to come and bury the body safely			1
safe burials " when it started , it was n't that easy , " says @entity58 , an @entity28 response coordinator in @entity45			1
" it was kind of difficult for communities to disclose death			0
people preferred driving us away			0
" " we must be grateful for the communities , through the efforts of the local leaders			0
now they are disclosing death to us , " he explains			0
today , the team has been called to a village where a woman has died of unknown causes			0
it may not have been from the deadly virus , but the villagers are not taking any chances			2
the @entity45 health team arrives carrying gloves , gowns , goggles and diluted bleach			2
they suit up : from head to toe , no skin is exposed			0
on their hands they wear three layers of gloves , securing the edges with clear tape at the wrists			0
before they enter the house to collect the body , one of them goes in and sprays the house with bleach			0
then -- and only then -- can the rest of the team enter to place the body in an airtight polythene bag , ready for burial			2
@entity105 rents the air as the burial team walks out of the house carrying the body on a stretcher			0
some of those crying are the dead woman 's family members ; for their own safety , they can only mourn from a distance			0
town abandoned a few kilometres away from the village is @entity117 : most of the houses here have been abandoned , their doors padlocked and windows shuttered			2
some of the residents abandoned the town in such a hurry that their clothes and floor mats have been left hanging on clotheslines			1
@entity130 , a community worker , tells @entity2 the empty houses belong to people who either died of @entity28 or those who fled in terror , for fear of contracting the virus			1
@entity130 says he lost his 8 - months - pregnant sister , his brother , niece and many , many others : too many to name			2
they died , " he says			0
" so many people die -- the houses on your right and even the houses on your left			1
they are all gone , " says @entity130			0
it 's hard to imagine another area in @entity45 that has been harder hit than this one			2
but then there 's @entity154 -- of the 1,000 or so @entity28 - related deaths in @entity1 , 20 % of the victims have died in this single town			1
quarantine zone home to more than 8,000 people , @entity158 is now under quarantine : no one can go in , and no one can go out			2
the toll of the isolation is weighing heavily on the community			0
" from the time we started receiving death from @entity28 -- every activity cease , " says @entity166 , the town 's chief			1
" because we do farm here and now there 's been no farming			0
" " we need food , we really need medicine			0
but the most important one is medicine because the hospital is closed down , there is no health worker , " he says			2
this is what life is like across @entity45 : the people are locked in , afraid and alone			0
and not even the health workers are spared the ravaging effects of @entity28			1
sometimes when they are called in to investigate a case , they get there only to discover the victim is one of their own			0
ebola nightmares one of the local clinics had to be locked up after all the healthcare workers based there contracted the virus			1
" it is very heartbreaking			0
you are working for the team at the front and you see them lying down			0
day by day , they are dying , " says @entity58 , who admits the harrowing work he does has caused him nightmares			1
" sometimes we go to bed and we dream of nothing else but @entity28 , @entity28 , @entity28 -- nothing else , " he explains			1
" several times i dream i become infected , i see myself in the case management center			0
" but he says that amid all the bad news , he is beginning to hear happier tidings : an increasing number of @entity28 survivors , people who initially tested positive for the virus but -- because they reported it early and because of the medical teams ' efforts -- later recovered			1
these positive outcomes keep @entity58 hopeful as he and other health workers continue to tirelessly explain to the community how to prevent infection			1
" it is difficult to stand in front of @entity28 , but this is the situation we have , " he says			1
" we must do everything we can to kick @entity28 out of our country			1
" staying at home or running away from @entity28 is not a solution , so we have to face it			1
we have to fight it			2
to get it to zero			0
