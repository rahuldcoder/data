@entity0 -- @entity3 lawmakers made a fresh push tuesday to gain passage of a law that punishes those who lie about earning high military honors			1
the @entity9 ruled june 28 that the @entity10 of 2006 was unconstitutional , saying it violated the free speech rights of those making false claims about winning the @entity14 and other combat citations			1
a revised , more narrow version would make it a federal misdemeanor for anyone to benefit financially from lying about military service , records or awards			2
that would include receiving federal veterans and health care benefits , government contracts or jobs reserved for veterans			2
similar state and federal fraud statutes are already on the books , but this law codifies sanctions for those seeking to profit strictly from false military service			2
" we must defend the valor of those who have served our country , especially those men and women who have earned awards for outstanding service , but that we also must protect the very liberties for which our service men and women sacrificed , " said rep. @entity36 , @entity37			2
" the @entity10 of 2011 would achieve both objectives			1
" @entity36 , who is also a colonel in the @entity51 , and co-sponsor sen. @entity52 , @entity53 , held a news conference on the @entity3 with supporters of the bill , including @entity57 , a retired @entity58 and 2008 @entity60 recipient			2
" it 's not about really a person			2
the awards represent character , they represent the character of the individual , " said @entity63			0
" they represent character of the unit , character of the service , character of the country			0
those awards actually do n't belong to me , they belong to all of us			0
it 's a trademark of the country is what it is , for what happened that day			0
" at issue before the high court last month was the constitutional value of false statements of fact , and whether @entity88 went too far when passing the @entity10 in 2006			1
a former @entity90 politician was prosecuted by the @entity91 for publicly stating he had earned the @entity14 , when in fact the man , @entity92 , had never served in the military			0
that conviction -- and the law itself -- were dismissed			0
writing for the majority , justice @entity98 said the law violated free speech protections			1
" the nation well knows that one of the costs of the @entity104 is that it protects the speech we detest as well as the speech we embrace , " he said			1
" though few might find ( @entity92 's ) statements anything but contemptible , his right to make those statements is protected by the @entity112 's guarantee of freedom of speech and expression			1
the @entity10 infringes upon speech protected by the @entity104			1
" the high court has traditionally been skeptical of legislation attempting to limit or regulate " unpopular " speech or free expression -- such as burning the flag , picketing military funerals and the marketing of animal cruelty videos			1
but @entity52 said the revised legislation would " punish military liars and cheats in a way that satisfies the court 's concerns			1
" the freshman senator currently seeking re-election is also a 33 - year member of the @entity132 , a colonel in the @entity134			0
the original @entity10 was designed to " protect the reputation " of military decorations , citing " fraudulent claims surrounding the receipt of the @entity14 ( and other congressionally authorized military medals , decorations , and honors )			1
" similar laws have been in place since 1948			1
spearheading both laws were @entity145 and @entity146 , former @entity148 natives who helped draft the legislation and who lobbied members of @entity88 to pass it			1
the couple attended the event tuesday on @entity3			1
the @entity155 hope technology will soon eliminate many of the military medal frauds			0
they have been lobbying to secure a government - funded national database of all medal citations , making it easy for the public -- employers , voters , family and almost anyone -- to check to see who has received what			0
privacy concerns have blocked previous efforts			2
at a @entity172 briefing on tuesday , @entity173 , a spokesman for secretary of defense @entity174 , said since the @entity9 decision , the @entity172 had initiated a review of setting up such a database			1
" we are exploring options to stand up a database of valor awards and medals , we have n't arrived at a final conclusion yet , but that process is ongoing and the goal is to stand up such a database , " @entity173 said			0
the @entity172 review is examining not just a database of recipients of the @entity14 , which @entity173 says the @entity172 already has strong informational control over , but also many of the other medals of valor , such as the @entity193 and the @entity60			0
completing a database with so many awards and matching them to names of recipients going back as early as the @entity199 or @entity201 wars would pose an organizational challenge , something @entity173 said would have to be addressed in the review			0
" there are some complexities involved in looking back into history , we would obviously hope to be able to go as far back as possible , but we also want there to be integrity in the data , " @entity173 said			0
one other complexity the @entity172 will have to examine is how to get around releasing names and operations of troops wounded on classified missions			0
" those are the kinds of things that we know we 're going to have to look at , " said @entity172 spokesman @entity217 capt. @entity216			0
@entity1 's @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity10 of 2006 was *deemed* unconstitutional by the @entity9
the high court said it infringed on the @entity104 right to free speech
