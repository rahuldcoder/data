@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 woke up early on february 18 , the same way she does every morning			1
" my alarm usually goes off at 4:30 , 4:45 , " she said			1
" i lay in the bed and kind of plan out my day			1
" she had no idea that her life was about to be targeted by a man with a vendetta against the government			1
she got up , woke up her son and headed to work at the @entity14 offices in @entity1			1
" the first thing i do is get in , organize my desk and wipe it down ... fire up my computer and tell everybody good morning , " @entity15 said			1
" before i know it , the building kind of went to the left and came back ... " i thought it was an earthquake			1
just a few minutes before 10 a.m. , a single - engine @entity25 crashed into the multistory building where @entity15 worked			1
" it was like an explosion , " she said			2
" the windows started breaking out and the tiles started falling from the ceiling , and then it was dark			2
" @entity15 said she went to check on her co-workers , and they headed for the nearest door			2
" as we open the door , this ' poof ' sound comes in as if it were a flame or something behind it , " she said			2
" so we immediately shut the door and we smelled that smell , it was probably jet fuel			2
" they closed the door and stood there , trying to figure out how to escape			2
" the first thing that crossed my mind is i 'm not going to see my son anymore , " @entity15 said			2
a few blocks away , @entity49 was driving his truck on his way to install windows when he spotted something strange in the sky			2
" i looked on the horizon and i just saw a little dot and ... i 'm staring at it like , ' what is this ? it does n't look like a bird or anything			2
" and i realized it was a plane			1
" realizing there was no airport around for miles , he figured the pilot must be having problems			0
" when i saw it disappear , within seconds i saw a big plume of black smoke , " he said			0
" i exited the highway , and i saw that all this smoke was coming from this building			1
all i saw was all the shattered glass and all the smoke coming out , and i thought , ' oh jeez , he hit a building			1
' " authorities say they believe the pilot , @entity81 , had ripped seats out of the small plane and put in a drum of fuel to cause maximum damage			1
@entity81 allegedly set fire to his $ 230,000 home in @entity1 before embarking on his fatal flight			1
@entity91 's apparent suicide note ( @entity92 ) investigators believe @entity81 targeted the building because it housed @entity14 offices			1
a 3,000 - word message on a web site registered to @entity81 railed against the government , particularly the @entity14			1
@entity15 did n't have time to think about what had happened , or why someone had crashed a plane into her office building			1
" we were all screaming for help , " she said			0
" by that time , the smoke was getting real bad			0
i kind of crouched down on the floor trying to get some air from under there			0
" and [ i was thinking ] i 'm going to have to jump because it 's getting worse in here			0
" the next thing she knew , she saw what she thought was " an angel from heaven			0
" @entity15 and the others survived			0
but the attack killed one of their co-workers , longtime @entity14 employee @entity121			1
@entity15 said she had a lot of memories of @entity121 , whom she worked with before her job at the @entity14			1
" he 'd do anything for you , " she said			0
she questioned why he , of all people , had to die			0
but she said the tragedy actually made her faith in @entity132 stronger			0
" i 've been raised all my life to go to church and believe in @entity132 , and it 's like , you know , maybe it 's time for me to start believing , " @entity15 said			0
" and that 's when it came to light that this was my test			0
" i 've really lived a good life			0
i 've never come so close to death			0
i 've had family members die , and it was a little different			0
but when it faces you , it 's a different feeling			0
