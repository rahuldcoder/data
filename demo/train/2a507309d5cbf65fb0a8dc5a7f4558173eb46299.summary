-- tempted as i am to write about @entity3 's sexual compulsions , i think it is more important to talk about his wife , @entity5			1
what the hell was she doing at @entity3 's press conference tuesday , where he once again asked her and the public for forgiveness for a new set of sexual transgressions , instead of being at her attorney 's office ? if this were a multiple - choice test for my students in my class on intimate relationships at the @entity23 , i might phrase the question like this : two years after the former congressman ( and now @entity28 mayoral candidate ) left his office in disgrace because he had " sexted " revealing pictures of his body to women , he was alleged to have once again taken on an anonymous identity , reportedly making sexual overtures and exchanging explicit pictures with a young woman			1
why did @entity5 stand by him and defend him in a press conference ? a ) she is insanely ambitious and wants to be the wife of a successful politician			1
b ) she believes he has a problem and she is going to help him with it because that 's what a woman does for her man			1
@entity49 ) she believes in her marriage vows and ca n't stand the idea of breaking up her family			1
@entity53 ) all of the above			0
@entity53 is probably the right answer			0
@entity56 and lewd photos : an @entity3 timeline it 's one thing to stay with your guy when he has a big problem			2
it 's another to support him going after public office only to find yourself dragged in front of the cameras again after he engages in the same compulsive sexual behavior that you forgave before			2
she could have said , " ok , we 'll fix this , but we need you in treatment , not in public office			0
" obviously , leaving public office is n't in the cards , and that 's significant			2
but @entity79 and @entity80 also ring true			0
@entity5 's behaviors are squarely in the realm of women 's high esteem for love , friendship and loyalty , and for tending and befriending the weak and the beleaguered , as described by @entity89 psychologist and professor @entity90			1
this gives the impression of being a doormat , but the woman thinks of it as being stalwart and noble			0
@entity5 may not be quite in this category -- but she seems dangerously close to it			2
finally , there is the role of family			0
for some women " till death do us part " means just that			0
they believe in staying in a marriage no matter what , especially when a small child is involved			0
if the man is a good father -- and there is every indication @entity3 is -- a wife will go to extremes to stay married so why does @entity5 stay ? we do n't know , but it 's surely complicated			1
her steadfastness is hard to watch though			0
she does n't deserve this , and he does n't deserve her			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity121 .			2

@entity121 : why did @entity5 stand by **husband** in new sexual *scandal* ?
she says it 's likely a *combination* of things : her ambition for her **husband** , faith in marriage vows
she says @entity5 may believe a woman stands by her man and wants to *preserve* her family
@entity121 : @entity5 may be in " tending and befriending " mode -- @entity3 does n't deserve her
