-- what are we afraid of ? that 's the one thing i still do n't understand ; the one question -- nearly a month removed -- i 'd love to have answered			1
what in the world are we so afraid of ? in its october 4 issue , @entity8 released a seven - page excerpt from my new book , " sweetness : the @entity12 of @entity13 , " a biography of the @entity16 ' running back			1
the short piece concerned @entity13 's post-football struggles , ranging from depression to infidelity to suicide threats			1
it was , admittedly , a jarring look at a man who , to most @entity24 , served as a beacon of light			2
throughout his 13 seasons as a @entity29 , @entity13 was n't merely a phenomenal running back			1
he was an @entity31 icon ; one of the faces ( and blinding smiles ) of the league			0
hence , to learn that @entity13 was -- what 's the word ? -- human , immediately rubbed many football fans ( and , in particular , @entity39 fans ) the wrong way			1
in 17 years as a journalist , i 've never received so many vicious letters , so many confrontational tweets , so many threatening e-mails			0
the general take ( in sanitized terms ) : how dare you write a book about @entity13 when he 's not here to defend himself ? how dare you			1
to be honest , i was initially taken aback			0
you devote three years to a project , only to be judged on a sliver of a sliver of the full body of work			0
i felt the need to defend my intentions and stand up for my honor and convince every single naysayer that " @entity13 " was a detailed , exhaustively researched biography that delves into the ... blah , blah , blah			1
now , i 'm just mad			0
this is what biographies are supposed to do			0
from @entity67 's astonishing " @entity66 : a life of @entity69 " to @entity71 's " @entity70 : the @entity72 " to @entity74 's " the last boy : @entity78 and the @entity79 , " portraits of our icons should be truthful , fair and -- perhaps most important -- unflinching			2
we should want and expect this			0
they are written neither to love a subject nor loathe a subject , but to fully understand a subject			0
in other words , to provide a history lesson			0
in the years i spent trying to grasp @entity13 , i learned to love -- truly love -- a uniquely giving , empathetic , quirky man			1
the portrait of @entity13 that already existed in the popular consciousness had been an overly simplistic ( ie : mindless ) one : the hard - nosed gridiron warrior who cracked lots of jokes and always had time for the fans			1
@entity13 's background ? no interest			1
@entity13 's motivations ? @entity100			1
@entity13 's struggles and conflicts and pains ? no , thank you			1
so what if @entity13 's own autobiography , " @entity105 , " was an ode to the @entity109 school of gosh - golly - gee selective storytelling ? hey , it made us smile and sounded awfully good			1
well , @entity13 was so much more than good			1
back in the fall of 1970 , he was a key peg in the desegregation of the @entity116 ( @entity117 ) @entity118 ; he was the black football player who -- by running 70 - yard sweeps and walking with a quiet , confident dignity -- convinced skeptical white classmates ( many of whom had never before spoken with a black person ) that , hey , maybe this will work out ok			0
he went on to star at @entity128 , where his brightest moment came not on the football field , but as a finalist on the @entity133 ( he and his partner , @entity131 , finished second -- a setback that haunted @entity13 as much as his failure to score a touchdown in @entity137 )			1
while in college , @entity13 changed his birth year from 1953 to 1954 , inexplicably hoping the extra youth would give him in edge in @entity143 balloting ( it worked wonders -- he placed 14th )			1
when he was drafted by the lowly @entity16 , he cried in disappointment -- literally , tears streamed down his face			0
when his father died in a @entity151 , @entity117 , jail in 1978 ( the police thought he was intoxicated ; truth be told , he was suffering from a brain aneurism ) , he cried in devastation -- vowing to never refer to the place as his hometown again			0
@entity13 signed every autograph request			1
@entity13 dodged myriad interview requests			2
@entity13 desperately wanted to be known as the greatest running back of all time			2
when @entity13 became the @entity31 's all - time leading rusher in 1984 , he shooed the media away			2
@entity13 wanted people to know he did n't eat red meat			1
@entity13 consumed @entity166 and @entity167 like a vacuum cleaner			2
@entity13 was elated to be inducted into the @entity169			2
@entity13 loathed the @entity169 induction ceremony -- knowing his wife and girlfriend would both be attending			2
when he retired after the 1987 season , @entity13 found himself searching for meaning in places where no meaning could be found			2
for 13 seasons he had been the toast of @entity39 -- an incomparable running back and civic ambassador			0
then , suddenly , it was over			0
his efforts to become an @entity31 owner fell short			0
his businesses yielded mixed results			0
his marriage was merely for show			0
he was lonely and angry and depressed , and -- at his absolute lowest -- he wrote suicide letters and contemplated taking his own life			2
and yet , it is also beautiful			0
throughout his darkest days , when @entity13 saw no hope and no future , he continued to treat the people of @entity39 as if they were his closest friends			1
on the streets of the @entity197 , he 'd offer hugs and smiles and pinches to complete strangers			0
he 'd pose for pictures , sign autographs , tell the stories of @entity137 or breaking @entity204 's all - time rushing record for the 12,471st time			0
in the final months of his life , @entity13 was made aware his liver disease had morphed into bile duct cancer , that no transplant would be coming ; that he was , quickly , dying			1
at that time , with nothing to gain , the man known as @entity13 did one public service announcement after another , urging people to save a life and sign up as organ donors			1
the impact : thousands of new registers			0
that 's a story worth telling			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 says he took a lot of heat for the *revelations* in his @entity13 biography
he does n't get it : why are people angry , afraid when they learn the truth about their heroes
he says @entity13 was complex man of *dualities* ; suffered hardships in early life
@entity224 : after retiring , @entity13 *adrift* but remained open to fans ; spoke out for organ donation
