@entity0 claims that it was his first wife , not gingrich himself , who wanted their divorce in 1980 , but court documents obtained by @entity6 appear to show otherwise			1
the @entity8 presidential candidate , now in his third marriage , has been peppered with attacks and questions about his divorce from @entity13 for the past three decades			1
questions about his past -- and what that past tells voters about his personal behavior -- have re-emerged as he has returned to the political scene 13 years after he resigned as speaker of the @entity22			2
a new defense that has arisen as @entity13 entered the presidential race this year is the insistence that she , not he , wanted the divorce			2
on the " answering the attacks " page of his campaign website , @entity0 , which " ( sets ) the @entity31 : @entity35 and his record , " the campaign discusses @entity13 's first divorce			1
" it was ( @entity13 ) that requested the divorce , not @entity0 , " the campaign website said , referring readers to an online column written by @entity13 's youngest daughter , @entity41 , last may			1
@entity41 , 13 when her parents separated in 1980 , was rebutting persistent rumors that her father served divorce papers on her mother the day after cancer surgery			0
in the column , @entity41 writes that papers were never served in the hospital , and that her mother did not actually have cancer			0
" my mother and father were already in the process of getting a divorce , which she requested , " @entity41 wrote			0
after initially being told that the divorce documents were sealed , @entity6 on thursday obtained the folder containing the filings in the divorce , which had been stashed away for years in a @entity63 , @entity64 , court clerk 's drawer			1
retired clerk @entity65 told @entity6 his deputy took @entity13 's file out of the public records room around 1994 , " when he ( @entity13 ) became the center of attention , " because @entity65 feared tampering and theft			1
" during these years , you had to make sure those papers were there , " @entity65 said			0
" people could go in those files and get things out			0
we did n't have enough security to control it			0
" @entity82 : original @entity83 @entity82 : motion for contempt @entity82 : petition for @entity87 current @entity63 clerk of court @entity88 said he called the retired deputy clerk , who told him where to find the papers , after @entity6 began looking for them last week			0
the documents , and interviews with people close to the couple at the time , contradict the @entity13 claim about who wanted the divorce			2
@entity0 filed a divorce complaint on july 14 , 1980 , in @entity63 , saying that " the marriage of the parties is irretriebably ( sic ) broken			2
" @entity104 , the congressman 's wife and the mother of @entity41 , responded by asking the judge to reject her husband 's filing			2
" defendant shows that she has adequate and ample grounds for divorce , but that she does not desire one at this time , " her petition said			0
" although defendant does not admit that this marriage is irretrievably broken , defendant has been hopeful that an arrangement for temporary support of defendant and the two minor daughters of the parties could be mutually agreed upon without the intervention of this court , " her petition said			0
" all efforts to date have been unsuccessful			0
" when @entity6 presented the information found in the divorce file to the @entity13 campaign , its spokesman stood by the contention that it was @entity13 's ex-wife who asked for the divorce in 1980			1
" @entity63 @entity64 court documents accurately show @entity0 filed for a divorce from his wife @entity13 , but it was @entity13 who requested the divorce , " spokesman @entity131 said in an e-mail to @entity6 saturday			1
" @entity13 , her husband , obtained legal counsel and filed the divorce papers initiating the legal proceedings			2
" " it was the same legal proceedings that determined and set the amounts of payments @entity13 would provide to support his two daughters , " @entity131 said			0
@entity149 divorce lawyer @entity148 , who was not involved in the @entity13 proceedings , said the wife 's divorce filings make it " pretty plain " that she did not want the divorce			1
" she obviously did n't want the divorce , on the face of the pleadings , " @entity148 said			0
one reason a defendant in a divorce would deny it was irretrievably broken would be " to make you stay in the marriage and put the screws to you to make it as difficult as they possibly can , " @entity148 added			0
@entity13 , who has rarely spoken to the media about the divorce , declined @entity6 's request for an interview			1
a friend said that @entity13 did not want to comment out of concern for her daughters and grandchildren			0
in a brief interview in 1985 , she told the @entity178 : " he can say that we had been talking about it for 10 years , but the truth is that it came as a complete surprise			0
" wives take lead in candidates ' ads @entity187 , a former close @entity13 friend , backed the contention that it was @entity0 who wanted the divorce			1
" he ( @entity13 ) said , ' you know and i know that she 's not young enough or pretty enough to be the wife of a president , ' " @entity187 , who now lives in @entity196 , told @entity6 recently , relating the conversation he had with @entity13 the day @entity13 revealed he was filing for divorce			1
@entity187 served as treasurer of @entity13 's first congressional campaigns			1
@entity187 , who was a fellow history professor when @entity13 taught at @entity203 in @entity204 , said he broke off his friendship with @entity0 because of the congressman 's treatment of his wife during the divorce			1
asked in an e-mail whether that conversation in 1980 occurred the way that @entity187 recounted , @entity13 spokesman @entity131 did not respond			1
@entity214 , a @entity64 state legislator at the time who also was in @entity13 's sunday school class , said it was his memory that @entity13 did not want a divorce			1
@entity214 laughed when told the presidential campaign is now saying she requested the divorce , calling that " surprising			0
" when @entity13 filed for divorce , he was already seeing a 28 - year - old congressional aide , whom he married six months after his divorce was final in 1981			2
the second wife , @entity225 , told @entity226 last year that @entity13 even introduced her to his parents in the summer of 1980 , the same time he filed for divorce			1
" they were thrilled because they had n't wanted @entity0 to marry ( @entity13 ) , " she told @entity226			1
@entity13 divorced @entity232 19 years later , after an affair with a younger congressional aide whom he married soon after his divorce			1
the third wife , @entity236 , is now a major figure in his presidential campaign			0
@entity41 wrote in may that she and her older sister , @entity243 , " will not answer additional questions or make additional comments regarding this meaningless incident			0
" both sisters are actively involved in @entity13 's campaign for the @entity8 nomination			1
the court documents obtained by @entity6 also shed light on the issue of the first - term congressman 's record of offering support for @entity13 and the two girls during the separation and after the divorce			1
the same court filing in which @entity13 told the judge she did not want the divorce also accused @entity13 of failing to provide enough money for her and her two then - teenaged daughters to live on during their separation			1
@entity243 was 17 at the time			0
" despite repeated notice to plaintiff and requests by defendant , plaintiff has failed and refused to voluntarily provide reasonable support sufficient to include payment of usual and normal living expenses , including drugs , water , sewage , garbage , gas , electric and telephone service for defendant and the minor children , " she said in court documents			0
" as a result , many of such accounts are two or three months past due with notices of intent to cut off service and gas and electricity			0
" when @entity13 and her daughters moved from their other home in @entity291 , @entity292 , back to their house in @entity204 , @entity64 , there were " no lights , no heat , no water , no food in the home , " former @entity13 friend and academic colleague @entity187 said			1
@entity187 , who helped collect donations for the family , said @entity13 " would n't give them a dime " in the first months of the separation			2
" we had a food drive at @entity308 , " @entity187 said			0
" the deacons went down and stocked her pantry			0
" @entity214 , the former state legislator who was in @entity13 's sunday school class , said when the church 's minister asked him to donate money , he gave $ 100 to the fund			1
a judge ordered @entity13 to appear in court a week after his wife filed her complaint			1
the result was a ruling that he bring the utility bills up to date and begin paying his wife $ 700 a month in temporary support until the case was settled			0
both sides reached an agreement three months later , avoiding the jury trial that @entity13 was demanding			0
@entity0 on @entity328 in 1994 , @entity13 agreed to increase his alimony payments by $ 350 to $ 1,650 a month			2
in exchange , @entity13 waived her right to ask for future increases if her ex-husband 's income increased			2
@entity13 is still paying alimony			0
" when asked , @entity13 has admitted he has not led a perfect life and has at times had to go to @entity339 for forgiveness , " @entity131 said			2
" over 30 years later , the family has long put these matters behind them			1
" @entity214 , who later challenged @entity13 in the 1984 congressional race , said the divorce and controversy over the support payments caused a lot of negative feelings against @entity13 in his home county			2
" i think the thing that bothered people most was everybody in @entity204 knew how much @entity13 sacrificed to get @entity0 elected , " @entity214 said			2
@entity6 asked @entity13 spokesman @entity131 in an e-mail about the allegation made by @entity13 in her october 1980 court filing that @entity13 was not supporting his family during this period , but the statement the campaign released did not directly address that question			1
still , @entity214 said there should be forgiveness and he would like to see @entity13 win the @entity22			0
" @entity0 is the smartest candidate in the field this year and he would bring an intelligence to the @entity22 that has n't been there in quite a while , " @entity214 said .			0

@entity0 's campaign says he divorced his first wife at her request
court files in @entity64 show she asked the judge not to grant the divorce
" over 30 years later , the family has long put these matters behind them , " @entity13 's spokesman says
questions about @entity0 's first divorce have *haunted* him for decades
