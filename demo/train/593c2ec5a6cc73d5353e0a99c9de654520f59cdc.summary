in space there 's no atmosphere , it 's never cloudy , and in geosynchronous orbits it 's never night : a perfect place for a solar power station to harvest uninterrupted power 24 hours a day , 365 days a year			1
the concept has been around since the 1940s when science fiction writer @entity9 posited the idea of a robot - manned space station that delivered energy to @entity14 via microwaves			1
today , the idea is less science fiction than a steadily advancing reality			1
clean energy from above the @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 all have projects at various stages of development that would see robots assemble solar arrays that could provide the @entity14 with massive amounts of clean and renewable energy delivered wirelessly			1
some variants of the idea could even see as much as @entity33 of energy beamed to receivers on @entity14 -- enough to power a large city			1
according to dr @entity40 , spacecraft engineer at the @entity39 , the concept is scientifically sound			0
" @entity42 and the @entity20 @entity43 did a study in the late 70s that cost $ 20 million at the time and looked at it in pretty great depth , " dr @entity40 told @entity2			0
" the conclusion at that time was that there was nothing wrong with the physics but the real question is the economics			0
" the cost lies in the number of space launches required to build the power - transmitting satellite			1
with costs as high as $ 40,000 per kilogram for some space launches , the final price - tag for the first space - based solar power station could be as high as $ 20 billion			1
private contractors while the recent entry of private space companies stands significantly to cut costs , basic physics dictates that getting payloads into space is still an expensive undertaking			2
" the subject is revisited every 10 years when the technology changes and some of the factors affecting the economics change			0
" he said the wars in the @entity77 gave new impetus to the space - based solar power as scientific researchers with the military wrestled with the problems of delivering energy to troops in hostile areas			1
multiple , and potentially hidden , receivers could tap space - based solar power and relieve the military of the expensive and often dangerous task of supplying troops with generator diesel by either road or air , he said			1
" if you could deliver electricity from space , that would be kind of attractive , " he said			0
safety concerns two proven ways of getting the power to @entity14 exist in the form of either laser beams or microwaves			1
the laser beam option would involve sending small laser - transmitting satellites into space at the relatively low cost of between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion			2
the self - assembling satellite would lower costs and the small diameter of the laser beam would make it easier to collect on the ground			0
but at just @entity117 to 10mw per satellite , many satellites would be needed to provide enough energy			2
as well as this , laser transmitting satellites would have difficulty beaming power through clouds and rain			0
the microwave option would have the advantage of uninterrupted transmission through rain , hail or any other atmospheric conditions and could provide gigawatts of power			2
microwave technology , dr @entity40 explained , has been established for decades : as early as 1964 , scientists were able to power a helicopter using microwaves			2
dr @entity40 said with a large receiving area the energy from the microwaves was so dissipated that it would present no danger to life			2
the chief disadvantage , however , is the fact that as many as 100 launches into space would be required to construct the space stations with costs running into tens of billions			2
" unfortunately , too , from a public relations standpoint , both microwaves and lasers have negative connotations for most people because they associate microwaves with the oven in their kitchen and lasers with science fiction space battles , " dr @entity40 said			1
the power sandwich his research is currently concentrated on the so - called " sandwich module " -- the part of the solar array that actually converts the sunlight into power			1
one side of the ' sandwich ' receives solar energy with a photovoltaic panel , electronics in the middle convert the current into a radio frequency and the other side has an antenna to beam it away			0
" people might not associate radio waves with carrying energy , " says @entity40 , " because they think of them for communications , like radio , tv , or cell phones			0
they do n't think about them as carrying usable amounts of power			0
" despite the technology already being available for space - based solar power , dr @entity40 believes the first space power station is still decades away even though the @entity23 have already made it one of the pillars of their space program			1
" without the similar research base that we have in the @entity20 for , say , fusion energy it 's unlikely to make meaningful progress , " he said			0
" if the @entity23 make progress in the next five years people might start to notice and say ' why are n't we doing that here			0
' ultimately , he said , space - based solar energy is like most novel ideas			1
" it 's hard to tell if it 's nuts until you 've actually tried			0

with no atmosphere , cloudy weather or even night , space is a perfect place to build our solar power stations
the concept has been around since the 1940s when science fiction posited the idea of a robot - manned power station
some variants could provide as much as @entity33 of energy beamed to receivers on @entity14 -- enough to power a large city
some scientists say only the cost of putting payloads in space is *preventing* the idea becoming a reality
