in case you missed it , a comet grazed the sun on @entity4			0
expectations had been high that @entity6 would survive this close encounter , swing around the sun and put on a fantastic sky show			2
it was hoped it might even become a @entity13 , with massive tails visible to the naked eye			0
but something really bad happened and now it looks like @entity6 may be just dust in the solar wind ( the sun was uninjured , @entity21 )			2
here 's what we know now about @entity6 : 1			1
is @entity6 dead ? well , maybe			2
after the comet flew about 730,000 miles above the sun 's surface , it started fading in images taken by @entity31 spacecraft			1
things got so bad that @entity33 , an astrophysicist with the @entity35 @entity34 and one of @entity6 's top fans , er -- chief observers -- wrote an obit for the comet			1
despite the eulogy , @entity33 said we have to wait for the @entity41 or other telescopes to confirm @entity6 's fate			1
" it seems unlikely at this stage that anything of significant size remains but @entity41 observations would help clear that up , " @entity33 told @entity49 in an e-mail			0
@entity31 also hinted there may be a bit of hope for @entity6 in its latest update posted online wednesday			1
the agency said it will use space telescopes to monitor @entity6 for the next several weeks because it 's possible that dust is hiding a new , smaller version of it			1
" most agree that up to 90 % of @entity6 was destroyed , leaving approximately 10 % of the comet intact			1
if previous sungrazing comets are any guides , there may be a sizeable piece of comet nucleus left			0
at this point , though , scientists are waiting for a variety of telescopes to make observations before the status of @entity6 can be confirmed			2
what do we call @entity6 now ? " i do n't think there is an official term yet , " @entity33 said			2
" i have been referring to it as a comet remnant , and that seems pretty appropriate			0
@entity6 was n't a flop			2
okay , it wo n't be a " @entity13 " or the " @entity81			0
" but @entity6 did become a social media superstar and it gave scientists tons of data			2
" it 's disappointing that we did n't get a spectacular naked - eye comet , " @entity85 of @entity86 said in a @entity31 science article			1
" but in other ways i think @entity6 was a huge success			0
the way people connected with @entity6 via social media was phenomenal ; our @entity86 website earned well over a million hits ; and i had trouble downloading images near perihelion because @entity31 's servers were swamped			1
" so maybe @entity6 was the ' @entity103 , ' " he said			0
@entity31 deep - sixes @entity105 comet hunter 4			1
@entity6 wo n't be forgotten			0
@entity6 's fate has become a near obsession for a special @entity109 group set up by physicist and astronomer @entity111 with the @entity113 and the @entity6 observing campaign			1
more than 300 members have been tracking the comet and sharing amazing pictures			0
many are still looking for @entity6 's remains and they are n't ready to declare it dead			1
" i think the evidence shows that something catastrophic happened to the comet , but i do n't think anyone is 100 % sure , " said @entity120			0
" ground - based observations and orbiting telescopic observations , such as @entity41 , later in december are important			0
but wait , there 's more ! believe it or not , @entity6 is not the only comet ! " there are several comets to enjoy right now , " @entity33 says			1
he likes @entity130 ( discovered by @entity132 amateur astronomer @entity131 ) , @entity133 and @entity134			0
" the bottom line is that there are several comets still visible , and even when the bright comets have gone , there will always be more			0
the night sky is full of wonderful things to observe , too , so people absolutely should get outside and explore the skies ! " @entity33 said			0
if you 're ready to go comet - hunting , here are some websites that ison observers say might help :			1

@entity31 telescopes are hunting @entity6 's remnants
a chunk of the comet may have survived
comet - *watchers* are not giving up on @entity6
