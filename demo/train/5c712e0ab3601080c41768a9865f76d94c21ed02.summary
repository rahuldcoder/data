-- @entity1 maintained his bid to become the world 's no. 1 golfer as he battled back from a horror start to his third round at the @entity8 's @entity7 on saturday			1
the @entity9 remained tied for the lead with teen prodigy @entity11 going into sunday 's final round in @entity9 as he retrieved a six - shot deficit			1
@entity1 , who needs to finish ahead of top - ranked @entity14 to go to the summit for the first time , had begun the day level with the 18 - year - old @entity18 and @entity20 's @entity19			1
but two double - bogeys and another dropped shot in his first six holes left last weekend 's @entity24 runner - up struggling before he rallied with four birdies on the back nine of the revamped wentworth course			1
@entity1 said he planned to consult with his @entity27 - based coach @entity26 after his unusually erratic showing			1
" he might have seen something and a little key could make a big difference			0
i did n't have much control of the ball , but i dug deep and i 'm very proud of the way i came back , " he told the @entity8 website			2
" i am going to have to play better than that for sure			0
i felt somewhat like @entity38 ( @entity39 ) -- in the trees , leaves on my back , dropping the ball , escaping from everywhere			0
" it would have been very easy to keep the head down and shoot myself out of the tournament , but i do n't like to do that and it was a great fightback			0
" @entity11 also carded a one - over - par 72 to be five - under 208 , with last season 's @entity8 rookie of the year mixing three bogeys with two birdies on his front nine			1
@entity14 was tied for third on three under with @entity55 surprise package @entity53 after a second successive 69 kept alive his hopes of a first win in the tour 's flagship event			1
" i am edging my way into the week and hopefully tomorrow i will play special because that 's what i think i will need to win , " he said			0
" it was a good 69			0
you 've got to be on your game -- it 's a tough examination			0
" @entity53 , twice a runner - up in minor tour events , bounced back from four bogeys in his first seven holes to reel off five in a row and then another at 16 to also sign for a 69			2
@entity19 dropped to a tie for eighth on 212 after suffering the embarrassment of two triple - bogeys in his 76			0
@entity77 @entity76 shot the best round of the day -- a four - birdie 68 marred by a dropped shot at the last -- to move up to a tie for 18th on 214 .			2
