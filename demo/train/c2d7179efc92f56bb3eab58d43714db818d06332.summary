@entity0 -- is @entity2 aiding and abetting terrorism ? the director of an @entity6 legal outfit says yes , and is threatening to sue the micro-blogging site if it does n't change its policies			1
@entity9 , director of the @entity10 , sent a letter to @entity2 on thursday asserting that the company is violating @entity14 law by allowing groups such as @entity16 and @entity17 affiliate @entity18 to use its popular online network			1
" it has come to our attention that @entity2 provides social media and associated services to such foreign terrorist organizations , " @entity20 wrote			1
" please be advised that ( doing so ) is illegal and will expose @entity2 and its officers to both criminal prosecution and civil liability to @entity14 citizens and others victimized " by @entity16 , @entity18 and other foreign terrorist entities			1
@entity2 declined to comment when contacted by @entity1			2
in her letter , @entity20 noted that @entity16 and @entity18 are officially designated as terrorist organizations under @entity14 law			1
she also cited a 2010 @entity38 case -- @entity39 -- which upheld a key provision of the @entity41 prohibiting material support to groups designated as terrorist outfits			2
" your provision of social media and associated services to @entity16 and other foreign terrorist organizations would constitute the type of seemingly innocuous material support that would render your company and you personally criminally and civilly liable , " she told @entity2 ceo @entity45			1
@entity16 - controlled @entity56 television currently maintains a @entity2 account with roughly 7,500 followers			2
other groups considered terrorist organizations by the @entity14 also maintain accounts			1
@entity63 , the @entity64 group that rules the @entity65 , posts regularly on at least one government - controlled account			0
@entity20 - @entity9 says she realizes there will be stiff opposition to a potential lawsuit from free speech advocates , but told @entity1 she nevertheless hopes @entity2 will change its policies			1
" once you bring it to their attention , they can not say that they do n't know , " she said			0
@entity79 , an attorney with the @entity80 , told @entity1 that the @entity38 " has not directly addressed the issue of whether any speech allegedly supportive of a designated terrorist organization is unlawful			1
" but " the government ca n't force private companies to censor lawful speech just because the government does n't like the speech or the people making the speech , " he said			0
@entity79 noted that since the @entity93 depends on private companies such as @entity2 to function , any clampdown or adverse ruling could be used to restrict everyone 's online communications			2
social networks @entity2 , @entity98 , and @entity99 have been lauded for the role they played in the @entity102 , a series of anti-regime protests that erupted across the @entity104 starting in late 2010			2
the online networks and instant messaging services were used extensively to spread the word about demonstrations , especially in the case of the @entity111 uprising that toppled longtime strongman president @entity112			0
a number of governments , however , have started arguing for stricter controls			0
authorities in the @entity117 say rioters used social the networks to coordinate mass civil disobedience earlier this year in @entity121			0
state prosecutors in @entity123 have accused two people of terrorism and sabotage by claiming that their @entity2 posts helped spread false rumors about a school attack , leading to real - life violence on the streets of @entity132			0
the @entity10 describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to " combating the terrorist organizations and the regimes that support them through lawsuits litigated in courtrooms around the world			1
" it supported a similar campaign earlier this year directed at social media giant @entity98			0
among other things , the center succeeded in getting @entity98 to pull down a page created by @entity145 activists calling for a " @entity146 " against @entity6			0
@entity1 's @entity147 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity10 is threatening legal action against @entity2
the center claims @entity2 has aided @entity16 and @entity18 by allowing them to use its services
the center notes that @entity14 law prohibits any aid to officially designated terrorist organizations
a free speech advocate *warns* of a possible restriction of internet freedom
