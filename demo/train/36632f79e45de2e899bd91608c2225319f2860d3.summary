@entity24 's @entity23 won the 190.5 - kilometer ( 118 - mile ) stage to take an early advantage in the month - long race , which is commencing in the @entity10 for the first time since 2007			1
@entity5 , from the @entity29 , admitted his maneuver was reckless and took full responsibility for the clash			1
