-- actor @entity2 's biggest role today is running the @entity3 , which is hard at work trying to rebuild the @entity6 neighborhood devastated by @entity7			1
@entity2 was one of the stars of @entity9 's " @entity11 " and most recently played a jazz trombone player in " @entity13 , " @entity9 's look at @entity6 after @entity7			1
he talked to @entity0 about what it 's like trying to revive " the @entity16			1
" @entity16 was featured in @entity17 's " @entity0 in @entity19 's @entity18			1
" @entity0 : tell me about the neighborhood where you grew up			1
@entity2 : @entity16 started in 1952 as a result of the civil rights movement			1
it was the only place where blacks were allowed during segregation to purchase @entity29 homes			2
two hundred acres were given over to a golf course , with 1,000 homes around it , multidenominational churches , a university and schools			2
we refer to it as " the @entity16 , " but i 've described it as the black @entity40			1
although separate but equal , my parents ' generation created something that was bucolic			2
it was an incubator for talent			2
... it was not only an idyllic place to grow up , there were also high expectations			1
it was expected that everyone would go to college			2
in the middle of it was this wonderful golf course created by @entity56 , who did most of the golf courses in @entity6 but could n't play on any of them			2
@entity0 : what was it like when you first saw @entity16 after @entity7 ? @entity61 : it was devastation			1
we thought the neighborhood would never come back			2
and then i realized there was too much history			2
it was one of the most stable neighborhoods in the @entity19 : 90 percent home ownership , less than 10 percent poverty in a city with 80 percent , no crime			1
i put out a call to action to people in my generation			2
too many people suffered and protested and worked too hard to create @entity16			1
we 're not going to let this one incident destroy it			2
@entity0 : how is your initiative to bring it back going ? @entity61 : it 's going great			1
some movement is happening with transfer of properties to us			2
we stand in line to get something like 250 properties , and we are up to 20 or 25 now			2
we put up our model homes , which are geothermal and solar			2
we have 200 people in line to purchase homes , and that 's before any marketing			0
getting the [ rebuilding ] money is what 's holding it up			0
we have the properties , the homes ; we have people qualified with the bank , and we are still trying to access the money			0
that 's the last difficult step			0
the money to assist people comes through the state			0
but they keep changing the rules and the qualifications and the goal - lines all the time			0
so it is n't appropriated			0
that 's because the state is hostile to the city and is trying to reappropriate the money to other parts of the state and not to the @entity6			1
that 's the political fight that you have to constantly have			0
three billion dollars has been appropriated [ to rebuild after @entity7 ] and has n't been spent in five years and that 's because there 's an agenda supported by many that do n't want people to move back			1
@entity0 : what are the conditions in @entity6 now ? @entity61 : right now in @entity6 , it 's worse than the week of the storm			0
we 're talking about people who own their property and who did n't receive any insurance			0
my parents had @entity138 insurance , and they got $ 400 after paying premiums for 50 years			0
it was criminal , a criminal action			0
so you have people who own their property , like my parents did , whose insurance policies were not recognized			0
and there 's $ 3 billion to assist them to get back in their homes , and the state is not doing anything to help them out			0
why has n't it been used ? because it 's a concerted effort to reappropriate the money and keep the poor and black people out			1
let 's put it this way			0
there is no large - scale redevelopment plan by any governmental entity in @entity162 , five years after @entity7			1
the only large - scale thing they did was to destroy public housing and get rid of a large population of minority people and the poor			1
there are no large - scale initiatives			0
mine is one of the largest			0
we plan to do 550 [ homes in the @entity16 ] ; compare that with the fact there are 30,000 to 50,000 blighted properties here			1
there is a concerted effort to redistrict the city , a concerted effort to keep thousands of people out , change the demographics of the city and hope people give up on a mass scale			1
in times of crisis like this , we see the best and the worst of people			0
it 's a reminder we are not far off from the days when the ugliest aspects of the country were made into law , so it can so easily go right back into it			0
@entity0 : so who 's moving into @entity16 ? @entity61 : we have everyone imaginable ; we have elderly , we have young couples trying to get in , we have 80 - year - olds trying to get back into their properties			1
this is a close - knit community			1
who 's moving in ? look in the mirror , and that 's who 's in @entity16			1
no matter who you are , young or old , it 's a diverse group of people , a predominantly @entity212 community that 's been stable ever since it was constructed			1
meet some residents of @entity16 @entity0 : the government 's not rebuilding @entity6			1
do you think grass - roots groups will bring @entity6 back ? @entity61 : while the government does not have a plan , it is the citizens who came to government and worked with them to lead them to reconstituting the neighborhoods			1
the lower 9th and @entity226 neighborhoods were harder hit ; they have further to go			0
this is happening all over the city			1
that 's the saddest part			0
what surprised me the most [ when i began this ] was the lack of skill and competence on the government 's part to know how to put this together , and how strong the effort to stop people from moving back to @entity6 is			1
@entity0 : what do you mean when you talk about " onesies and twosies " ? @entity61 : it 's no good to build one or two houses in a city that has 50,000 blighted properties			2
like , this church group says " we 're doing three houses right here , " a business group says it 's doing two houses there , then " i 'm a contractor ; i 've got three houses over here			0
" we need large - scale development			0
my group is not put together to do a hundred houses			0
our goal is 7,000 in the city , about 550 in the @entity16			1
@entity0 : did the @entity9 show " @entity13 " capture the real @entity6 ? @entity61 : well -- you ca n't tell all the stories ; there are so many , so you ca n't please everybody -- but there is an authenticity to our show			0
it 's true and real			0
of all the shows about the city , this comes the closest to being authentic			2
@entity0 : you play a jazz musician in " @entity13 " and do lots of numbers			0
do you really play the trombone ? @entity61 : yes , i do play the trombone , but i play very poorly , so they turn my mic off , and my sound double plays			0
but i learned every song , and i 'm getting better !			0

@entity2 grew up in @entity16 , an idyllic community ruined by @entity7
he runs initiative to rebuild community but *frustrated* with government *inaction*
@entity2 says holdup in funding housing is effort to keep poor , minorities from returning
@entity2 : " there is a concerted effort ... to change the demographics of the city "
