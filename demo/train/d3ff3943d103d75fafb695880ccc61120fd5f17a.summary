the @entity0 on tuesday asked for the public 's help in identifying an @entity4 - speaking militant who appeared to help execute @entity6 soldiers in an @entity8 recruitment video released last month			1
in the 55 - minute video titled " @entity12 , " the jihadist switches from classical @entity14 to perfect @entity4 with a @entity11 accent , and appears to orchestrate a mass execution of @entity6 soldiers			1
the @entity0 reached out to the public on its website tuesday , posting a portion of the video and asking whether anyone has information about the jihadist 's identity			1
" we 're hoping that someone might recognize this individual and provide us with key pieces of information , " @entity24 , assistant director of the @entity0 's counterterrorism division , said tuesday			1
the request is part of the @entity0 's broader outreach to the public to help identify people seeking to travel overseas to fight with terror groups , and those who are returning from such fights			1
@entity38 intelligence officials have been trying to analyze the recruitment featuring the @entity4 - speaking jihadist			1
officials see the killer 's appearance in the video as significant because he comes across , they say , as articulate and persuasive , a person of influence within the terror group			2
in the video , there are a number of men digging a ditch behind him			0
the jihadist , whose face is covered except for his eyes , claims they are @entity6 soldiers assigned to a @entity59 military base near the @entity6 city of @entity61 , and who , after an @entity8 attack , were " digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed			1
" @entity68 can not independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers , as the propaganda video claims			0
the video then shows the speaker and a group of militants executing the men , who fall into the ditch			2
the man who led this atrocity on film could be an @entity80 who was educated in the @entity82			0
or he could be an @entity11 or @entity83			2
if so , @entity68 terrorism analyst @entity84 said , he would be the first @entity11 jihadist to commit a war crime on camera			1
" clearly @entity8 had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera , " said @entity87 , a security analyst at @entity88			2
" why ? because he seems @entity11			2
the message is aimed at a @entity95 audience			0
" on sunday , fbi director @entity96 told @entity100 ' " @entity99 " that his agency is tracking a dozen @entity38 that have joined terrorist groups inside @entity6			0
" these homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way , and so they come across the propaganda , and they become radicalized on their own , sort of independent study , and they 're also able to equip themselves with training , again , through the @entity109 , " @entity96 told @entity100			0
" and then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement			0
" last month , federal authorities detailed their case against the owner of a @entity117 food store who they accused of funding @entity8 and plotting to gun down @entity38 troops who had served in @entity122			0
a law enforcement official told @entity68 that former @entity125 resident and @entity38 citizen @entity124 could be a key player in the @entity8 social media machine that 's become renowned in recent weeks for spewing brutal propaganda online -- messages meant both to terrify and recruit @entity82			1
and @entity68 obtained tapes of @entity11 terrorists recruiting friends in the @entity38 to join terror groups like @entity8			1
@entity8 has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe , including from the @entity38 and @entity137			0
a @entity139 source told @entity68 last month that more than 15,000 foreign fighters , including 2,000 westerners , had gone to the civil war in @entity6			0
it was not immediately clear how many had joined @entity8 and how many were with other groups opposed to the @entity6 government			1
the foreign fighters come from more than 80 countries , the @entity139 source said			0
a top @entity148 official insisted monday that @entity11 efforts to combat @entity8 ' powerful online message are working , successfully keeping disaffected youth from joining the extremist group			1
" we have evidence that there are young people who are not joining because we have somehow interceded , " under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs @entity153 told @entity68 's @entity155 on monday			0
" they 're reading the messages , they 're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of @entity165 clerics who have said that this is a perversion of @entity165 , from the hundreds of @entity165 scholars who have said the same thing			0
" " it 's a very small cohort , " @entity153 said of these so - called " foreign fighter " cases originating from the @entity38 .			2

@entity0 seeks public 's help in identifying @entity4 - speaking militant
the @entity8 fighter , *possibly* an @entity11 , appears to help execute @entity6 in a video
the 55 - minute video released by @entity8 shows the jihadist leading a mass execution
in the video , jihadist speaks first in @entity14 , then in @entity4
