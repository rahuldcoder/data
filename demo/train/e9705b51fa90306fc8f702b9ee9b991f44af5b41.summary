-- pope @entity1 ended 2009 much as he began it -- with a major gaffe that angered @entity4			1
he started the year by welcoming a @entity6 - denying bishop back into the fold , and ended it by putting the controversial @entity9 - era pope @entity10 one step closer to sainthood			1
" it seems that the pope does n't always know what 's going out under his name , or the impact of what 's going out under his name , which is very strange to observe because @entity25 was so media - savvy , " said @entity15 , a @entity4 journalist and author who has long been based in @entity17			1
the @entity10 episode " seems to be yet again a case where they did n't estimate what the response would be , " @entity15 said			2
in both cases the pope quickly found himself having to explain and clarify			0
he lifted the decades - old excommunication of bishop @entity34 in january , part of an effort to reconcile an ultra-conservative movement with the @entity38			1
three other bishops associated with the @entity40 were un-excommunicated at the same time			0
the excommunications were not related to @entity34 's holocaust denial			0
but it was @entity34 who caused outrage , not only among @entity4 but also among @entity47 bishops and politicians , because the bishop had been filmed denying that the @entity50 systematically set out to murder @entity4 in the @entity6			1
the video was freely available on @entity52 -- and by march , the pope was admitting the @entity38 should have googled @entity34 before letting him back into the church			2
the excommunication 's remission caused " a discussion more heated than any we have seen for a long time , " @entity1 wrote in an open letter to bishops in march			2
" i have been told that consulting the information available on the @entity64 would have made it possible to perceive the problem early on , " the pope acknowledged			0
" i have learned the lesson that in the future in the @entity38 we will have to pay greater attention to that source of news			0
" he made his first visit as pope to @entity76 in the wake of the controversy -- a visit planned long before the @entity34 uproar erupted -- and delivered a clear message : " every effort must be made to fight anti-semitism wherever it is found			0
" but fresh controversy blew up this month when he issued a decree proclaiming the " heroic virtues " of pope @entity10 @entity10 , who reigned from 1939 to 1958 , is perhaps the most controversial pope of modern times , accused by detractors of not speaking out against the @entity91 persecution of @entity4			1
( @entity92 titled his book about @entity10 " @entity94 , " just to make his point perfectly clear			0
) @entity96 , a former chief rabbi of @entity76 and himself a @entity6 survivor , said it would " shame " the @entity38 to declare @entity10 a saint			1
" especially not now , when many survivors are still alive			0
it will hurt them deeply to know that the man who could save [ them ] , could do much more and did not do it , " he said			0
" it is not a good education for generations to come			0
" even as the @entity6 was going on , the @entity111 was pushing @entity10 to act			1
" at the time of the @entity6 , questions about @entity10 's public silence were raised by @entity116 , the @entity111 representative to the @entity118 , and @entity116 's assistant , @entity120 , who requested that the @entity38 speak out on the issue , " the @entity112 said monday			1
" the opening of the post- 1939 archival material is essential to a proper assessment of @entity10 only then will a sound and accurate portrait of his moral leadership during the @entity6 be possible , " the museum argued			1
@entity1 's spokesman , father @entity130 , called @entity10 an " important pope that we know was guiding the church in very difficult times			1
" the @entity38 has long argued that @entity10 did more behind the scenes to help @entity4 than he gets credit for -- but has not produced proof			1
it says it will open the @entity38 archives from @entity10 's era to scholars , but not for several more years , blaming the delay on the length of time it takes to catalogue and prepare the materials			1
but by wednesday , @entity130 was backpedalling on the wartime pope			0
first , he said , @entity1 had merely ratified a decision which the @entity38 committee that evaluates candidates for sainthood had already made about @entity10 further , the pope 's declaration was about @entity10 's " intense relationship with @entity155 and continuous search for evangelical perfection ... and not the historical impact of all his operative decisions , " @entity130 said in a written statement			1
the decree " is in no way to be read as a hostile act towards the @entity4 people , and it is to be hoped that it will not be considered as an obstacle on the path of dialogue between @entity172 and the @entity173 , " @entity130 said , looking ahead to the pope 's planned visit to the main synagogue in @entity17 in january			2
the visit will be the first time a pope goes to the synagogue since @entity25 did in 1986 , and is meant to be a major symbol of good relations between the two faith communities			0
@entity1 is a @entity182 -- in fact , he was forced as a young man to join the @entity185 -- and an accomplished musician who relaxes by playing piano			0
so why does he have such a tin ear when it comes to the @entity6 ? @entity15 suspects that different factions within the @entity38 may be competing for influence			2
she noted that both the @entity34 and @entity10 controversies blew up " soon before what were expected to be major advances in @entity47 - @entity4 relations " -- the trip to @entity76 and the synagogue visit			1
the @entity201 jewish community , for its part , seems to understand the competing pressures on the pope , she said , citing a cartoon in the @entity4 monthly @entity205 showing @entity1 walking across @entity17 's @entity206 towards the city 's main synagogue -- on a tightrope			1
he holds a pole for balance , with a flag on one side saying " dialogue " and the other saying " conversion			0
" " it 's a very sympathetic cartoon for the pope , surprisingly sympathetic , " said @entity15 , the author of " virtually @entity4 : reinventing jewish culture in @entity219			2
" whatever gaffes may cause problems between the @entity38 and the @entity4 community , @entity15 said , there is little chance of a complete rupture in relations			2
" dialogue with the @entity4 is now embedded in @entity38 doctrine , " she said			2
" it 's a loud dialogue			0
but if you do n't have opposing views , it 's not dialogue -- it 's an echo chamber			0
" @entity0 jerusalem bureau chief @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
