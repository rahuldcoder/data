-- if the " @entity6 " of @entity8 football needs a sharp reminder of where she wants to be , wednesday 's @entity2 clash should provide it			1
any trip to the @entity10 to face @entity11 -- the nine - time champion of @entity13 -- is one to savor , even for a club of @entity6 ' stature			1
it will also reinforce president @entity18 's resolution that his rejuvenated side still has a long road to travel before its regeneration is complete			1
the @entity24 team 's name in @entity25 means " age of youth " -- and this journey , for a club formed 115 years ago , is indeed still maturing			2
when @entity18 took charge in 2010 , becoming the fourth member of his family to take the role , the @entity8 giant was still piecing itself together from the " @entity39 " match - fixing scandal which saw it stripped of two @entity37 titles and demoted to the second division in 2006			1
the 37 - year - old has overseen a transformation of @entity6 's fortunes on and off the pitch , the club having moved to a new stadium at the start of a season in which it would claim its first title in nine years			1
yet despite increasing revenue by 32.8 % in the past financial year , the " @entity6 " still made a loss of € 15.9 million ( $ 21.9 million )			1
@entity11 , on the other hand , posted revenue of € 520.9 million ( $ 715.8 million ) -- 36.9 % of which was profit			2
" @entity59 and sponsorship , those are the two elements that we have to grow , to reach a point to become independent from @entity2 revenues , " @entity18 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			1
" then , once you get them , that is the extra fat you can work on			0
" at the moment , and this is the thing that worries me the most , we are still dependent on that ( @entity2 income ) to make the numbers meet			1
" @entity6 made more money than any other club in last season 's competition -- € 65.3 million ( $ 89.7 million ) -- over € 10 million more than eventual winner @entity77			1
that figure owed largely to a domestic television deal that improved once fellow @entity8 club @entity81 failed to negotiate its way through the playoff stages			2
the windfall underlines how vital a revenue stream it is for the club , and the precarious nature of an existence which relies on the luxurious flow of money from competing at @entity13 's top table			2
that fact is even more evident after last weekend 's results			0
despite leading 2 - 0 at @entity95 on sunday , @entity6 eventually fell to a 4 - 2 defeat , a result that leaves it five points behind leader as @entity101 and vulnerable to attack from the likes of old rivals @entity104 and @entity105 -- both circling below			1
if @entity6 does n't manage to make it a hat - trick of a successive @entity37 titles , it must at least cling onto third spot to qualify for the @entity2 playoffs			1
should the club then make the lucrative group stages , that revenue will tide it over until the end of next season , when several key financial shackles will be lifted			1
" this year and the following we are going to struggle , but in 2015 - 16 , that is when a number of important contracts expire and others can kick in , " @entity18 explained			1
" that should put us in a position to become independent from @entity124 sports competition revenue			0
that will be very important for the club			2
" it means the year you might fail on sports results , it does n't compromise the work in ( other ) years			0
" the only alternative you have if that is the case is to sell an asset you have grown internally , and we do n't want to do that because we want to be competitive			0
" a vital component of @entity6 's future is its new stadium			1
its former @entity139 home , built for the @entity140 in @entity8 , was cavernous and crumbling			0
stifling in terms of facilities and atmosphere , it had become a 69,000 - capacity relic			0
the @entity59 may be significantly smaller , with an all - seater capacity of 41,000 , but it is regularly full and provides a far more intimate experience for spectators			0
whereas the stands at the @entity139 were an average of 70 meters away from the pitch , fans at its replacement are just seven meters from the action			0
and though the move has increased revenue , @entity18 claims @entity6 is being held back by a clutch of old stadiums that proliferate @entity37 " our stadium has been very important but i think we 've filled the gap with the @entity124 competition , " @entity18 added			1
" at the moment it 's very important from an environmental point of view because it really does give a different rush to the team			2
but we struggle in terms of pricing because all our competitors are in old stadiums			0
" the perfect benchmark for our stadium is @entity174 -- 41,000 people both of them -- but @entity176 generate more than double we do in terms of pricing			0
" according to @entity18 , @entity59 is not only vital to renewing his club 's future , but can also act as a lightning rod for @entity8 football			1
whereas once it was the most desired place to play domestic football in @entity13 , now it has fallen behind @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 , with @entity187 and @entity188 gaining ground all the time			0
" there are a lot of resources which can be gained from the stadium but we also suffer from the same show , which is being put up at our competitors ' stadiums			0
they are obsolete and they price them completely differently , " @entity18 explained			2
" you can debate that @entity6 vs. @entity104 is the same as @entity104 vs. @entity6 in terms of the show on the pitch but the theater is completely different -- they price it one way , we price it another			2
" that kind of becomes unacceptable for the spectator			0
once all the others get new stadiums -- if and when -- that means you can raise the whole level of the show			0
" that for us is paramount because us alone , we are just a white flag , as interesting as we might be			0
