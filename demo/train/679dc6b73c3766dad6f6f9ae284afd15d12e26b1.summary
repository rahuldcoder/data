-- @entity1 is crazy fun , but do n't worry if you missed your chance to buy a pair on tuesday , when it went on sale to the public for $ 1,500			1
while the current generation of @entity1 is doomed to become a clunky @entity11 collectible , it 's nonetheless a leading indicator of a vast wearables revolution poised to sweep into our lives			1
that is , if it can get past some hurdles as we speak			0
there 's been anti-tech backlash against @entity1			1
not everyone is down with it -- for reasons such as privacy -- but when these challenges are overcome then we 're in for some interesting times			0
eyeglass companies are already designing sleeker , less pricey versions of wearable displays , and developers are busy creating better apps			0
simply put , the information revolution is moving from personal to intimate			1
it is just the latest chapter in a long trend that began in the 1980s when computers arrived on our desktops			0
then in the 1990s , the gizmos shrank into laptops and disappeared into our backpacks and briefcases			0
@entity1 targeted as symbol by anti-tech crowd with the arrival of smartphones a decade ago , our computers now fit into a pocket , becoming constant companions			1
at each stage of this evolution , our devices insinuated themselves ever deeper into our lives , performing ever more essential tasks and becoming ever more important info - companions			1
now our devices are poised to disappear			2
they will disappear into our lives as small , absolutely essential tools that we will notice only when we lose them			2
info - glasses today are like pcs in 1984 -- they look cool but perform a few functions that are n't all that useful , such as taking pictures or surfing the web while sitting in a bar with friends			1
but just as pcs quickly became vastly more useful than mere word processors , new info - glass apps will allow us to perform more essential tasks			1
professionals from surgeons to surveyors are already prototyping apps that help them work in smarter ways			0
on the personal front , imagine an app that uses face recognition to tell you the name of the acquaintance walking toward you and your spouse at a cocktail party , sparing everyone the embarrassment of a fumbled introduction			2
this is just one example of what is coming			0
just as we have been surprised by search and social media , we are certain to be astonished by the capabilities of the device sitting on the bridge of our nose			0
the scale of surprise is certain to be huge because info - glasses are just one of a zoo of wearable devices that are coming into our lives			1
health - centered devices such as the @entity101 are already wrapping themselves around our wrists , competing for space with a new generation of smart watches			2
other devices will live in our pockets and eventually will be woven into the fabric of the clothes we wear			0
some devices are destined to become yet more intimate , living under our skin			2
some will be serious medical devices			0
others will be for sheer whimsy -- imagine a subdermal display that is in effect a changeable electronic tattoo			0
hobbyist hackers today can buy an implantable rfid chip kit complete with injector for less than $ 100			0
implant it in your hand and use it to talk with electronic door locks			0
all of these devices will communicate with each other and info - glass successors to @entity1 are likely to become an important control panel for communication between wearables and their human owners			1
bicyclists will use info - glasses as a heads - up display for everything from road speed and map route to heart rate and glucose levels			1
our new wearables will , with very few exceptions , also be in constant communication with cyberspace and real - time information systems			2
parents who are out to dinner will be able to discretely listen in on the baby monitor back home or view streaming video off a bedroom webcam			0
the arrival of @entity1 has resulted in a debate over where and when info - glasses can be worn			1
just like similar debates over pagers , cell phones and smartphones in years past , wearables will likely be everywhere			2
besides , unlike smartphones , info - glass hardware is going to quickly shrink into near - invisibility			1
within a few years , smart glasses will be indistinguishable from an ordinary pair of vintage 2014 specs			0
and after that ? how about info - contact lens that can check your vital signs ? and privacy ? forget about it			1
we are destined to become like tagged bears , constantly tracked , but too addicted to the data stream to switch our intimate devices off .			2

@entity178 : current @entity1 are doomed to become @entity11 collectibles
@entity178 : but @entity1 signals a wearables revolution poised to sweep into our lives
he says similar devices are moving from personal to intimate spaces
@entity178 : info - glasses might be made *obsolete* by info - contact lens in the *future*
