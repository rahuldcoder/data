@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's the largest producer of cocaine in the world and a key supplier of heroin to the @entity8			1
according to the @entity9 , @entity0 produces 535 metric tons of cocaine a year , most of it for the @entity8 market			1
the @entity14 country has retained its status as key cocaine producer in spite of an ambitious anti-drug agreement launched a decade ago with the financial support of the @entity8			1
the agreement is called " @entity0			0
" since 2000 , the plan has cost the @entity8 $ 7 billion , according to the @entity22 , a @entity23 think tank that has closely monitored the implementation of @entity0			1
the money has been mostly used to help @entity0 strengthen its police and military			0
before the implementation of @entity0 , 50 % of the @entity29 territory did n't have a government security presence			1
@entity31 , a former @entity29 minister of defense and one of the architects of @entity0 , says the agreement has helped her country to strengthen democracy and government institutions			1
it has also increased the @entity29 government 's ability to fight what she calls " narco - terrorism			0
" but @entity31 also says that the high drug demand in the @entity8 makes it difficult to eradicate production at home			1
" i really believe that the @entity14 strategy against drugs is not enough			0
it 's probably a failure			0
it 's [ a policy ] that they have to review , " says @entity31			0
@entity0 welcomes @entity8 drug czar @entity52 this week			1
@entity52 , in his role as director of the @entity56 's @entity55 , will do a progress evaluation of plan @entity0 as part of his trip			1
ahead of his visit , @entity52 told the @entity29 newspaper @entity62 that he sees a commitment on the part of the government of president @entity66 , who took office in august			1
" we 're going to talk about the continuation of the relationship between both countries , not only in terms of reduction but also in terms of prevention and demand , " said @entity52			0
security experts , including @entity29 @entity78 , say @entity0 has improved security , but it has fallen short on its original goal of reducing drug production in the region			2
in what is known as the balloon effect , increased army attacks against drug traffickers in @entity0 has moved coca and poppy crops elsewhere			2
" and the quantity of the drug production from the @entity92 countries like @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity0 is the same as 10 years ago , " says @entity78			2
@entity96 , a journalist who has traveled extensively in areas where coca is grown , has witnessed the balloon effect			0
she says drug traffickers just move to other countries , but also relocate within @entity0			2
" there are still drug dealers [ in @entity0 ]			2
there 's still a lot of drug trafficking , and there are still a lot of crops in many regions of the country , " says @entity103			0
what 's even more troublesome , the @entity23 - based @entity22 says that roughly 90 % of cocaine sold in the @entity8 still comes from @entity0			1
@entity114 , the organization 's president , says that " @entity0 's many critics rightly point to the policy 's failure to meet the fundamental purpose for which the program was developed : to reduce the availability of drugs , particularly cocaine in @entity8 communities , " says @entity114			1
in @entity0 there 's a new push to refocus government efforts on improving socioeconomic conditions for the population as a means of making organized crime and guerrillas associated with drug traffickers less appealing to peasants who live in marginalized areas			2
@entity0 's problems go well beyond drug trafficking and security			0
about 50 % of @entity29 live in poverty , and 60 % have no regular employment			0
now that security has improved , many @entity29 such as security analyst @entity78 say it 's time for the @entity29 government to address issues such as social inequality and long - term development as a way to slow down the seemingly never - ending production of illicit drugs in @entity0 .			0

since 2000 , @entity8 has funded anti-drug initiative " @entity0 " at cost of $ 7 billion
one of the architects of plan points out democracy has been strengthened in @entity0
critics point out that 90 % of cocaine sold in @entity8 comes from @entity0
@entity8 drug czar @entity52 will visit this week to check on progress of anti-drug effort
