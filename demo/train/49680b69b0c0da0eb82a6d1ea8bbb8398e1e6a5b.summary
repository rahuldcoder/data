-- state laws that place restrictions on teenage drivers and require them to " graduate " from an intermediate license to a full license do seem to prevent fatal crashes involving teens , but only among the youngest drivers			1
a new analysis of national crash data published this week in the @entity12 found that between 1986 and 2007 , the rate of fatal accidents involving 16 - year - old drivers was 26 % lower in states that prohibited teens from driving at night and carrying certain passengers , compared to states with neither restriction			1
among 18 - year - olds , however , strong graduated driver licensing ( @entity24 ) programs were associated with a 12 % increase in the fatal crash rate , which effectively cancelled out the benefits among younger drivers			1
when teen drivers of all ages were pooled together , the link between these programs and the rate of fatal crashes was statistically negligible			2
@entity0 : your car made healthy " right now , we 're not getting the net effect across all teens that we 're hoping for , " says @entity36 , @entity37 , the lead author of the study and a researcher at the @entity40 , in @entity41			0
" we 're getting this washout where we do save some lives overall , but not nearly what we thought it [ would be ]			0
" since the first @entity24 programs were established in 1996 , there have been 1,348 fewer fatal crashes involving 16 - year - old drivers and 1,086 more involving 18 - year - olds , according to the study			1
@entity36 and his colleagues ca n't explain the increase in traffic deaths among 18 - year - olds , but they suggest that it may be a form of " payback " for the restrictions on younger drivers			1
by limiting teen driving , they explain , graduated - license laws may deprive younger teens of valuable driving experience , and in some cases may lead teens to delay getting a license altogether			0
" they 're saying , ' forget it			0
i 'll wait till i 'm 18 , ' " @entity36 says			0
" we have , at least in @entity72 , more novice 18 - and 19 - year - olds with no driving experience			1
" @entity0 : 7 ways to drive like a pro @entity24 programs are now in place in one form or another in all 50 states plus the @entity81			1
every state requires would - be teen drivers to first get a learner 's permit , during which they can drive only with a parent or other adult , but beyond that the strength of the programs varies			0
for the purposes of the study , @entity91 and his colleagues considered @entity24 programs that prohibit teens from driving after 1 a.m. and carrying certain passengers to be " stronger , " while they considered programs with just one of those restrictions to be " weaker			1
" the pattern of fatal crashes associated with weaker gdl programs was similar , though less pronounced , than the pattern seen with stronger programs			2
in states with weaker programs , fatal crash rates were 16 % lower among 16 - year - olds and 10 % higher among 18 - year - olds than in states with neither of the two key restrictions			1
@entity0 : your emergency car kit " the expectation was that older [ teen ] drivers would n't be affected much one way or the other , so this is a new thing to think about , " says @entity113 , @entity37 , senior vice president for research at the @entity115 , an @entity116 , @entity117 - based nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing traffic deaths and accidents			0
but @entity113 , who coauthored an editorial accompanying the new study , says this and other research suggests that @entity24 programs do help protect younger teen drivers			2
although " the evidence is mixed at this point about how @entity24 affects older teens , " she says , " i do n't think there 's any study that has n't found a large benefit for 16 - year - olds			1
" @entity0 : how to be safe -- not sorry -- behind the wheel the study had some important limitations that will need to be addressed in future research			0
for one , the authors looked only at fatal accidents , which account for a small percentage of all crashes and are n't representative of accidents as a whole			2
( alcohol and speeding are more often a factor in fatal crashes , for example			0
) @entity36 and his colleagues also suggest that the findings from their nationwide analysis do n't necessarily reflect the effectiveness of specific @entity24 programs , given the variety in state laws			2
the age restrictions surrounding graduated licenses differ between states , @entity91 notes , as do the laws concerning learner 's permits , passengers , and nighttime driving			0
