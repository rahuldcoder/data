-- like most stories that end up with a man mowing his friend 's lawn in a dress , it started out innocently enough			1
@entity7 takes a quick break for the camera while fulfilling his end of the bargain			0
not long after @entity13 began working on his man cave , his friend @entity7 paid @entity13 a compliment			1
he noticed @entity13 was looking trimmer since they 'd last met			0
as @entity13 continued to slim down , they made a bet : whoever could get down to 200 pounds first would be the winner , and the loser would have to mow the winner 's yard -- in a dress			1
@entity13 started building his man cave in @entity27 , @entity28 , so he could have the bar of his dreams and a home theater			1
he worked on his basement for more than a year and ended up losing 65 pounds in the process -- more than enough to win his bet with @entity7			1
@entity0 and @entity35 got an overwhelming response when we asked readers to send in photos and stories of their man caves : spaces that foster men 's hobbies , decorating skills and technological needs			1
some of their stories were so outrageous that we decided to profile a few of them			0
@entity13 's man cave , however , was the only one to combine dramatic weight loss and cross-dressing , so we had to give him a call to find out more			1
@entity13 said his friends wanted to talk about two things while he was building his man cave : how his amazing bar was coming along and how they thought @entity7 would lose the bet			1
the bet was popular with everyone @entity13 and @entity7 knew			2
their wives even started a dress committee , to make sure the loser was appropriately attired , and their kids delighted in the prospect of seeing @entity66 in a dress			1
to lose weight , @entity13 said @entity7 played golf and cut out chips , while he adopted a balanced , calorie - restricted diet , and spent at least six hours a day on the man cave , which took most of his free time			2
@entity13 did all the electric wiring himself , worked on the framing and put three coats of paint on all the walls and ceilings			0
he attributes his weight loss success to replacing tv - watching with hard work			0
" i lost at least 10 pounds on the painting alone , " he said			2
" my neck was sore for weeks			0
" @entity13 knew he could n't build the kind of man cave he wanted all by himself , so he contracted out some of the big jobs , like cutting a hole in the foundation to add 6 - foot - tall @entity91 doors to the side of the house in place of a window well , and finding someone to do the woodwork on a custom bar he designed			1
although he started out with a carefully planned budget , @entity13 quickly found he needed to spend more money to make his dreams a reality			2
the hardest part , he said , was finding someone who could build his bar for a price he could afford			2
after some disheartening estimates ( one was $ 65,000 ) , @entity13 found @entity108 , a local furniture maker who had built libraries in the @entity112 in @entity113 , and constructed a chair for a @entity117 @entity116 justice over his long career			0
now 76 and retired , @entity108 told @entity13 , " i can build anything out of wood			0
" @entity13 said @entity108 was true to his word , and they did n't go over the initial estimate of $ 19,000 , although he said @entity108 told him " if he had it to do all over again , he 'd have charged double			0
" @entity13 calls the bar " magnificent , " and said that when people come over to see it , they feel underdressed			2
convinced he 'd saved money by doing a lot of the work himself , @entity13 splurged on a new sprinkler system			0
the bet he 'd made earlier in the year was on his mind , and he wanted to ensure that the grass in his front yard would be nice and green once the weigh - in arrived			0
at the height of summer , @entity13 's man cave was finished , and he decided it was time to step on the scales			1
@entity7 was 208 pounds , and @entity13 was 195			0
at the party @entity13 threw to show off his new bar and theater , @entity7 was ready			0
with some help from the dress committee , @entity7 became @entity13 's newly acquired , frock - sporting landscaper			1
the wives had sewn two pink , strapless dresses together to fit @entity7 , and then layered on accessories like a bow - topped headband and a corsage			2
all decked out , @entity7 graciously mowed @entity13 's front yard , with 80 people cheering him on			0
somehow , as @entity7 was mowing , @entity13 's new sprinkler system went off , soaking @entity7 and his dress			2
in a phone interview , @entity13 was coy about who the perpetrator might have been			0
these days , @entity7 has his own man cave , complete with bar			1
@entity13 points out that his bar is nicer , but says he 's got his buddy 's back : @entity7 's wife thinks a dishwasher would be a practical addition to the man cave , but @entity13 is trying to convince her that the keg refrigerator @entity7 wants is a good idea			1

man builds man cave , loses 65 pounds in the process
of all the man cave tales submitted to @entity35 , this is first to *include* a dress
bar of man 's dreams is " magnificent "
dress committee sews two dresses together to fit the loser of the bet
