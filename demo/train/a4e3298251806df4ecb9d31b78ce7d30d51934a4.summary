@entity0 , @entity1 -- when the topic of @entity5 enters a conversation , @entity3 hears that it 's " just what gays get			1
" " it 's not a gay disease , " said @entity3			2
" it 's a human disease			0
" when a person gets a disease like cancer , support pours in , said @entity3 , a slender 27 - year - old with a boyish face			1
family and friends fund raise and make sure their loved one gets proper care			0
but that 's not the case with @entity5			1
" it 's like hush - hush , " said @entity3 , a @entity0 native , who learned before his birthday in april that he has @entity5			1
they 're going to point a finger at me and be judging me			0
" just from the community , i know they do n't talk about it			1
@entity0 has many years before we 're close to @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity35			0
if something goes wrong , you do n't talk about it			2
" it 's a problem all across the @entity39			0
the @entity40 is disproportionately struck with higher hiv / aids rates than much of the rest of the country			1
dealing with the epidemic in the @entity54 " is extremely challenging , because the stigma and discrimination is worse , " said dr. @entity44 , director of the @entity46 for @entity5 , @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49 at the @entity50			1
" there is less discourse around prevention , sexual health , comprehensive sex education in schools or having strong , community - based advocacy activities			2
" pastor fights @entity5 stigma in rural town @entity0 has the fifth - highest number of @entity5 diagnoses among @entity68 cities , according to @entity50 statistics from 2008			1
the state says this could have been a statistical aberration because surveillance methods and hiv / aids reporting laws changed in @entity1 in 2007 , causing fluctuations in the data			1
but local @entity5 advocates in northeast @entity1 say the problem is a real one , not just a statistical blip			1
" here in @entity0 , we 're kind of the buckle in the bible belt , " said @entity80 , executive director of @entity81			0
" @entity5 carries a huge stigma in our city			1
" @entity80 said the organization had trouble finding office space in 2000			0
one property owner refused to rent to the group , saying he did n't want people with @entity5 in his buildings			1
today , the office sits on a quiet , tree - lined street with a simple sign that reads : @entity96			2
a red ribbon , the ubiquitous sign for @entity5 , usually adorns the logo for the organization			1
" clients did n't want a red ribbon on the door , " said @entity80			1
" we had to take it down			0
" four blocks away , there is another @entity5 organization -- one named for @entity109 star @entity108 , who revealed in 1991 that he is hiv - positive			1
when that clinic opened a decade ago , the ribbon - cutting ceremony was held inside the lobby			2
organizers moved the event indoors because people feared being seen and associated with the disease			0
today , that one - story clinic tucked behind a towering magnolia tree no longer bears @entity108 's name			2
" the only way we can get people to come through the front door is to create a fictitious name			0
" said @entity125 , associate director of @entity127 operations at the @entity128			0
" no one walks into any building or floor that has any association with @entity5			1
" although visible @entity5 signs may be scrubbed from public view , the epidemic has worsened			1

" this disease is ruining lives , and it 's still killing people , especially low - income people who do n't get tested enough and who do n't get treated early			1
" several hiv / aids advocates in @entity0 criticized sex education in schools that emphasized abstinence			1
the mentality is that @entity5 is not an issue here , several advocates said			1
" denial is the biggest problem , " said @entity125			0
and those who reveal their @entity5 status struggle to find acceptance			1
@entity3 observed that some people who knew about his @entity5 status avoided physical contact with him			1
in social settings , they watched their drinks to make sure their glasses did n't get mixed up			2
" sometimes you feel like a pin cushion , like you 're never going to find acceptance , " @entity3 said			0
" you feel like you 're going to be looked at as a disease , not as a person			0
" what perpetuates the epidemic is a social issue , @entity125 said			0
in @entity1 , the @entity5 focus has historically been placed in southern part of the state			1
some of the earliest hiv cases were found in @entity33 and in the @entity184 immigrant population in @entity1			1
@entity33 still struggles with new hiv / aids cases ; often , it has the highest aids rates in the country			1
" you can go to @entity33 and you can put up a billboard , you can talk about condoms , @entity5 and sex , " @entity125 said			1
" you ca n't do that in @entity0			1
they do n't want to talk about it or see it			2
they do n't want to see billboards about it			2
" and @entity0 is no small town : it has about 821,000 residents			0
@entity200 share their stories on @entity202 it 's a different population , said @entity143			0
" in north @entity1 , our population profile is more like @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 than it is central and south @entity1			1
that generally means higher rates of poverty , lower rates of completing high school and college , and higher percentage of @entity218 population			2
" @entity137 has a high percentage of african - americans , and in @entity0 , 71 % of the total @entity5 cases are african - americans			1

he keeps a half - dozen orange prescription bottles of @entity228 medications on his nightstand next to his red leather - bound @entity230			1
the pages of his well - worn @entity230 are patchworks of green and orange highlights			2
he reads scriptures every night and attends a baptist church twice a week			0
because his faith is crucial , @entity223 decided to tell the head minister of his church how he struggled with being gay			0
he wanted to have prayer meetings with ministers and start a church support group			0
@entity223 told the minister : " i 'm not the only one			0
lots of people are keeping quiet , living double lives			0
" the minister rebuffed him , saying , " wow , it 's times like this , i do n't like being a minister			2
" " that 's one aspect of black churches , " @entity223 said			0
" they want to turn blind eyes to it			0
... i 'm fighting this battle on my own			0
" @entity223 left that church and found another one last month that is more accepting			0
" we pretend it 's not happening , " @entity223 said			0
" the virus is being spread			0
you want to pretend like sex is n't happening			2
they say , ' condoms , oh , no ! that 's not for @entity270 ! ' what 's not for @entity270 is living with ignorance			0
" the social climate in northern @entity1 tends to be more conservative , said @entity143			1
" there may be a reluctance to talk about this in the family , in the church , in other social settings and to perhaps ignore it , " he said			0
but there are signs of change			0
churches in the community have started to talk about the @entity284 , said @entity285 , 50			0
@entity285 has never felt the need to hide her aids diagnosis and told her fellow church members and her pastor			0

while stigma persists in the community , it 's getting better , she said			2
she reported seeing growing hiv support groups , increasing turnout at community hiv / aids events and a recent line of people waiting to get tested at a mobile clinic			1
" it shows me that people are willing to become more educated because @entity5 is prevalent and relevant			1
