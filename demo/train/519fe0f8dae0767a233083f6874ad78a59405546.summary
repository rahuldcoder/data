-- april 13 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : to our @entity16 fans in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and to everyone who 's watching us around the world , welcome to @entity0			1
from the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , i 'm @entity28			2
first up : @entity4 nuclear crisis @entity30 : first up , @entity4 's prime minister wants some answers from the company that runs the @entity35 nuclear power plant			1
specifically , the prime minister wants to know when the crisis at the plant is going to be over			2
he 's looking for a timetable from the @entity40 , and he says one should be coming soon			1
he 's also promised to get this crisis under control " at all costs			1
" in the meantime , the @entity4 government has classified the situation at the @entity35 plant as a level 7			1
that means it is among the most serious nuclear accidents ever			1
that rating is based on how much radiation has been released from the plant , and it means officials expect long - term efforts to deal with all the issues caused by this accident			1
thousands of people have had to leave the region around the plant			2
the prime minister promised to help them find jobs , housing and education			2
what 's happening in @entity4 has some people remembering another nuclear accident that took place nearly 25 years ago			1
it was a meltdown at @entity5 nuclear plant in the @entity70			1
@entity71 looks at the long - lasting effects of the worst nuclear accident in history			1
( begin video ) @entity76 , @entity76 correspondent : we 're driving through the exclusion zone en route to @entity5			0
it does n't feel like a place where the world 's worst - ever nuclear accident happened almost 25 years ago			1
the sun lends a wintry charm to the derelict homes we passed			0
in all , nearly 350,000 people were forced to abandon their homes as a radioactive cloud blew over @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
this village is called @entity94 in @entity90 , which literally means " behind the forest			0
" but as you can see now , it has been completely consumed by the forest			0
and when the villages were evacuated about ten days after the accident took place , they thought that they 'd be able to come back here , that this village would be inhabitable again			1
but as you can see , that was n't to be the case			0
so , this is the memorial			0
how many people died immediately after the accident ? @entity111 , chernobyl guide : answer , about 30 people in one month died overall			1
@entity76 : @entity114 , who 's our certified guide from @entity90 's ministry of emergencies , says the final death toll from the nuclear fallout is impossible to calculate , but that it 's less than people feared			1
estimates from the @entity124 put the number at 4,000			0
but the @entity126 points to 4,000 incidents of thyroid cancer among children from the affected areas			1
@entity131 : so now , it 's 8.7 , 9 microsieverts			1
@entity76 : radiation 's not down to normal , but @entity114 says it 's not a health risk if you 're just here for the day			1
@entity131 : we 're staying here just minutes , but it 's not so sure if such levels of radiation inhabiting here is not allowed			2
@entity76 : we 're not the only visitors			0
a @entity92 tour group picked their way through frozen tower blocks in nearby @entity148			0
the town was evacuated the day after reactor number four exploded , before the @entity70 admitted it had a serious problem in one of its nuclear plants			2
this year , the government will remove restrictions to the exclusion zone , turning these @entity70 ghost towns into a tourist destination , a chance for people to see for themselves the relics of a nuclear catastrophe frozen in time			1
@entity71 , @entity0 , @entity148 , @entity90			0
( @entity164 ) what 's the word @entity167 , @entity14 : what 's the word ? when a government spends more money than it takes in , the difference is called a _ _ _ _ _ ? deficit that 's the word ! @entity175 @entity30 : in march , the @entity177 federal deficit was $ 188 billion			1
president @entity178 and @entity179 are looking at ways to reduce that deficit			0
republicans laid out some ideas last week			0
the president is scheduled to outline his plan in a speech later today			2
in more immediate budget news , though , we 're getting some details about the spending cuts that could be voted on this week			1
this is part of the deal that helped avoid the government shutdown last week			2
$ 38.5 billion in cuts would affect programs from the @entity196 , @entity197 , and @entity198 departments			1
of course , @entity179 has to pass that deal before any of it would happen , and votes are scheduled for later this week			0
@entity202 @entity203 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to the social studies students and teachers at @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity209 ! which space shuttle went into orbit first ? here we go ! was it : a ) @entity218 , b ) @entity217 , c ) @entity215 or @entity219 ) @entity214 ? start the countdown at three seconds -- and go ! @entity217 was the first shuttle to launch into orbit			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! retiring shuttles @entity30 : the launch happened exactly 30 years ago this week			2
and in honor of the anniversary , @entity229 is announcing where the shuttle fleet is going to spend its retirement			2
you 'll be able to visit @entity218 at the @entity235 in @entity236 and endeavour at a science center in @entity238			0
@entity215 is headed to the @entity239 in @entity6			0
and @entity240 -- a shuttle that never actually went into space -- will be on display at a museum in @entity245			2
the 30th anniversary of @entity217 's first flight was also the 50th anniverary of a major milestone for the @entity92 space program			1
@entity251 has more on that celebration			0
( begin video ) @entity251 , @entity254 , @entity255 : it was perhaps the greatest journey one man has ever taken			0
propelled 50 years ago into space on a @entity70 rocket , @entity258 made the first ever orbit of the @entity262			2
for 108 minutes , he was crammed inside his tiny capsule , giving the world a vivid commentary of the planet far below			2
@entity258 , @entity267 [ @entity268 ] : i am continuing the flight			0
the overload is somewhat increasing , as well as the vibration			0
but i am feeling well , and i 'm in great spirits			0
i can see the @entity262 and can distinguish the features of its terrain			0
chance : well , this is just a replica of the actual @entity280 capsule in which @entity258 made that first historic flight			0
for some reason , the original is kept in the museum of a state corporation and is n't on general public view			0
but this space exhibition in @entity255 is filled with originals , including a number of contemporaries of @entity258 himself			2
men like @entity294 , the first @entity70 cosmonaut to conduct a spacewalk , here to celebrate the achievements of 50 years ago			2
@entity294 , @entity297 [ @entity268 ] : in the past , we used to make a point of whether he or she was an @entity177 or a @entity92 or whatnot			1
in my view , if we do n't remember what happened 50 years ago , we will forget everything in 100 years			0
chance : at the height of the @entity308 , @entity258 's success was a high - profile victory over the @entity177 , seen as evidence of @entity70 domination in the space race			1
he was dispatched overseas in what the @entity313 called " missions of peace			0
" it made him a global icon			0
and his flight on april 12 , 1961 also led president @entity320 to declare that @entity177 would put a man on the moon by 1970			1
today , @entity177 astronauts are ready to acknowledge @entity258 's pioneering mission			1
@entity325 , @entity177 astronaut : well , there always has to be a first ( inaudible )			1
and at the time , you know , there was a big competition ( inaudible )			0
i will say here today , without @entity258 's flight , i probably would not have flown to the moon			1
chance : everybody 's friends now			2
@entity325 : oh , yes			0
chance : @entity258 did n't live to witness the hundreds who 've journeyed to space since his first flight			1
he was killed in 1968 in a plane crash			0
but an untimely death has only added to the mythical status of the first man in space			2
( @entity164 ) before we go @entity30 : before we go , do you remember the states we mentioned at the beginning of today 's show ? you would if you were in this competition			1
it 's the @entity177 @entity353 ; we 're talking mental muscle			1
the tournament involves memorizing names , faces and numbers			0
for one round , you have to memorize the order of a shuffled deck of playing cards			0
this year 's champion took home the title -- and broke two @entity177 records along the way -- last month in @entity245			1
goodbye @entity30 : we were going to tell you about it then , but then we , uh , forgot			0
we hope you remember to tune in for more @entity0 tomorrow			0
we 'll see you then .			0

witness the long - term effects of the world 's worst nuclear accident
hear which @entity177 government departments could be affected by spending cuts
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first person to travel into space
