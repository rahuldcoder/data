-- poor , poor celebrities			0
it 's probably overwhelming to be famous and on @entity3			2
the volume of posts , comments , likes and mentions on any given day is vastly higher for well - known people than it is for mere mortals			0
getting a grasp on the quick - moving chatter and knowing when to speak up takes effort			0
@entity3 is working on a new mobile tool that would make it easier for the @entity14 to slog through the noise and better communicate with their fans , according to a report from @entity19			1
a @entity3 spokesperson confirmed in an e-mailed statement that the company is working on " mobile features designed to help public figures interact with their fans " and said it was only testing them with a select group of people for now			1
it 's not clear how the feature makes it easier for the super-popular to sift through mentions from followers , or what was so difficult about doing it from the current mobile apps			2
it 's likely the feature will be useful to social media professionals more than actual celebrities			2
the more important the person , the smaller the chance that they are checking their own @entity3 page to see what their friends are up to and post selfies			2
it 's common for a social media manager to use the social network on an actor or musician 's behalf to post information about public appearances , carefully chosen snapshots and other updates			1
the helpers are n't just there to save famous people time			0
celebrities are lucrative brands that often depend on a carefully crafted and controlled public image			0
@entity3 wants to be a place where they can manage that image			0
@entity65 has dominated as a platform where the famous can broadcast their latest news and have some casual back and forth with fans			1
some high profile people do use the site to communicate all on their own , as evidenced by the many entertaining late night ramblings and @entity65 fights			0
@entity3 has tried other @entity65 - inspired features over the past year , including rolling out hashtags and offering verified pages to separate the impostors from the real public figures			1
the company is not shy about taking features that have been successful on other platforms and adding them to its own			0
if @entity3 can take over as a place where the famous go first to make an important announcement , or even a denial , it could ratchet up the company 's reputation as a go - to news source			1
the association would also lend some additional " cool " to the site , which is edging into its older age ( for a social network ) and concerned about staying youthful and relevant			1
but some folks online were complaining about the perceived elitist nature of special treatment for big shots			0
" dear @entity3 : put away the red carpet for celebs , we 're happy with just friends , " wrote @entity65 user @entity103 .			1

@entity3 is testing out a mobile feature for @entity14 only according to @entity19
the tool would make it easier for the famous to talk to fans through the social network
@entity65 is already very popular with celebrities and their handlers
