-- with @entity2 , the new controller - free system for its @entity4 gaming console , @entity1 is n't just trying to revolutionize video gaming			1
the company wants to change how people interact with all their entertainment choices			2
@entity2 , which goes on sale thursday , allows players ' physical movements to control action on the screen			1
unlike the similar @entity16 or @entity15 , there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push			1
three camera sensors and four microphones help @entity2 recognize who is standing in front of it			1
the system recognizes voice commands and reads a player 's full range of movements -- not just swings of the arm -- translating them into an avatar 's actions within a game			1
@entity35 , director of incubation for @entity2 , said @entity1 is trying to break down technological barriers and make game interaction more natural			1
" we wanted to transform entertainment where technology understands you , " @entity35 said during a @entity2 demo in @entity40			1
" it was our goal to merge really amazing tech with a really amazing experience			2
" @entity35 explained that the specific components used to create @entity2 have been around for years			1
he said the real breakthrough was in the proprietary software used to make it all work together			2
cloud profiles , featuring information accessed from the web on an as - needed basis instead of from a local hard drive , help the @entity2 and @entity4 learn about users and what types of entertainment they might be interested in			1
@entity2 also will help live - stream music , movies and more in real time			1
the much - anticipated system , first unveiled more than a year ago , is @entity1 's entry in the growing era of motion - controlled gaming pioneered by the @entity16 in 2006			1
@entity66 launched @entity15 , a motion - sensing game controller for its @entity68 console , in september			2
a @entity1 spokesperson said 30,000 @entity71 retailers would have kinect available thursday , with 7,000 of those planning to open at midnight			1
she would not say how many units would be available on launch day			2
the system will launch with at least 17 games			1
i spent four days testing out @entity2 , which should appeal to casual gamers and families more than hardcore action gamers			1
here are my impressions : getting started out of the box , the @entity2 sensor is 11 inches long and 3 inches high , including the motorized stand it sits on			1
connecting to the xbox is easy			2
for the new @entity88 consoles , it is plug - and - play -- no additional wires			2
to use on the original @entity4 consoles , you will need a power source for the device			2
after some software downloads , the @entity2 calibrates itself to the room automatically			1
it is actuated by specific gestures ( waving your hand at the @entity2 ) or by using a specific key word for voice commands ( " @entity85 " )			1
" it is technology that understands you , " @entity35 said			2
" @entity2 looks at 48 points on the body to figure out what it should do			1
it always knows who is in charge			2
" the @entity2 should go at or as near eye level as possible so it can read all your movements			1
also , it requires a clear space to play so nothing impedes its view of the player and nothing gets bumped or knocked over			2
someone playing alone will need to be at least 6 feet back , while two players should be about eight feet from the screen			2
@entity2 comes bundled with " @entity120 , " an introductory game that teaches you how to use the device			1
hovering your hand over game menu options activates those choices			2
five different adventures require the player to move and react to different scenarios			2
" @entity131 " will get you reacting to things being thrown at you			2
" @entity133 " and " @entity134 " get you dodging and steering			2
" @entity137 " requires using your arms to propel you in a weightless situation			2
" 20,000 leaks " will stretch you out as you try to stop water from rushing in through cracked glass			2
all of these adventures teach players how to use their movements to control the action on the screen			0
the gestures will come in handy for other @entity2 games			1
fun with wild animals " @entity156 " was demonstrated at the @entity150 in @entity151 in june , where it received high marks for its cuteness factor -- and lower marks for being , well , a little bizarre			0
in the game , players get to adopt a virtual pet			0
among the 40 choices are a @entity162 tiger , lion , panther , cheetah or leopard cub			0
by using voice commands and body gestures , kids can teach their cub to do tricks , feed and brush their baby animal , or just play games with it			0
it is definitely a game geared toward younger players			0
i play a lot of first - person shooter games , but i 'll admit there is something neat to rubbing a tiger cub on its belly -- even if it is virtual			0
full - body sports " @entity188 " cranks up the action with six different games at four different skill levels			0
from the outdoors to the table top , different sports challenge players to really get involved with the action			0
full body movements mimic those that would be needed to really play the sport			0
want to score a goal in soccer ? kick the ball			0
want to knock out your opponent in boxing ? throw a punch			0
" the only skill you need is life skill , " @entity35 said			0
" if you know how to bowl , you can bowl in our game			0
" the action and movements are lifelike and will get players moving			0
for example , while you wo n't actually have a javelin in your hand , you will need to run in place up to the line and throw			0
the escalating skill levels make it easy for players to learn what to do and master those actions before moving up to more challenging opponents			0
wheel - free racing " @entity230 " offers different game modes that let you race cars , do stunts or even crash into objects -- and each other			0
but it does n't feel quite right because , with @entity2 , there is nothing to feel			1
you control your car by grabbing an imaginary steering wheel			0
there is no accelerator or brake ; the game does that for you automatically			0
turning your hands left or right steers the car , but there is no tactile feedback to give you the sensation of running off the road or colliding with a light pole			0
this is n't a " @entity253 " title by any stretch of the imagination			0
but a racing game should have a feel to it -- this one just leaves you grasping for air			0
get your body moving two other initial titles , " @entity260 : @entity262 " and " @entity263 " are where @entity2 really shines			1
" your shape : @entity262 " features workouts created by @entity266 and @entity268 magazines			0
players are scored on how well they match the movements of instructors who demonstrate exercises			0
there are zen exercises for relaxation , or cardio boxing if you want to blow off steam in a different way			0
there are also personalized exercise plans to help lose weight , tone the body or get more energy			0
the game offers a good workout			0
@entity2 helps correct postures and actions so users can get the most benefits out of the exercises being done			1
in this way , it really does work well			0
" @entity263 , " made by the creators of " @entity298 , " aims to get you moving to the beat , but realizes we all are n't ready to strut our stuff on the dance floor			0
the game combines today 's dance hits performed by pop stars with moves that seem clunky at first but get more involved and intense as the difficulty ratchets up			0
like " @entity304 , " you have to match your movements to those on the screen to get a perfect score			0
beyond games because it has cameras , @entity2 also offers the ability to connect via video with other @entity2 users -- or those who use @entity1 's @entity314 on their @entity315 it also works with the other entertainment features for the @entity4 , such as on - demand @entity317 , music from @entity319 and movies from @entity321			1
" it is all about your choice , your content when you want it , " @entity35 said			0
the bottom line i did n't get to test out the 11 other games that @entity1 says will use the new controller			1
but my experience with the initial six titles shows where @entity2 will shine and where it will stumble			1
games that feature full - body movement make best use of what @entity2 can offer			1
syncing up your movements with the movements on the screen is a lot easier and more natural with @entity2 than with a normal controller			1
it 's also hard to compare the @entity2 to @entity66 's move -- the two systems are like apples and oranges			1
i was pleasantly surprised and amused by @entity2 's ability to record video while you are playing			1
while i was doing hurdles in " @entity188 ' " track and field , my kitten decided to join the fun and began jumping as i jumped			0
needless to say , the resulting video of us provided many laughs after the game			0
but games that would be better enhanced with a physical device in hand feel flat			0
on @entity2 , they 're just not up to the demands that players make from those types of games			1
you will probably not enjoy racing games and first - person shooter games as much with @entity2 that you do with regular controllers			1
right now , the @entity2 can understand languages from the @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 and @entity377 -- with more to roll out in the near future			1
@entity35 said they will be constantly refining voice - recognition software to help the system recognize dialects in each language			1
prices range from $ 399 for a @entity2 bundle to $ 299 for the @entity387 bundle and $ 149 for the @entity2 box by itself , without the console			1
is it worth it ? that may depend on whether you have kids -- and what kind of gamer you are .			0
