-- @entity1 is an addict			1
the " drug " she ca n't get enough of is potentially one of the most dangerous ones out there : fame			2
i bet that @entity1 wo n't even be upset with me saying this about her			1
why ? because her name is in the headline of this article			0
and on some level , i -- along with others in the media -- am enabling her addiction			2
but @entity1 is not the only person who craves fame			1
@entity18 is filled with people like @entity1			1
just watch any " @entity20 of _ _ _ _ _ , " " @entity24 " auditions , " @entity25 , " etc. even i enjoy making appearances on cable tv			0
of course , i do n't appear on these shows like @entity1 , scantily clad with my tongue hanging out and twerking nonstop			1
( and i 'm sure not many people would want to see me do that			0
) @entity1 may only be 20 years old , but she has mastered the game of manipulating the media to follow her every move			1
she did it in august at the @entity35 when she dry - humped singer @entity36			2
she followed it up in september with the release of her music video , " @entity41 , " in which she appeared naked while swinging on a wrecking ball			0
and just this past weekend she lit up a marijuana joint and smoked it during @entity35 's @entity44 telecast			0
granted , the awards show was held in @entity46 , where marijuana is legal			0
in fact , there 's even a @entity50 over there			0
would @entity1 have smoked pot on a @entity18 tv show , in violation of the law ? maybe			1
in order for @entity1 to get her fame fix , she 'll need to come up with more and more outrageous antics			1
there really is no incentive for @entity1 to change her ways			1
after all , she is n't doing it for the money -- her net worth is estimated to be $ 120 - 150 million			0
but rather , she would do it for the high of seeing her name in the headlines			0
at this point , there are a few paths @entity1 can take			1
she can follow the footsteps of fame junkies like @entity74 and @entity75 and become nothing more than a walking punch line			1
she can sadly go down the trail of young stars whose lives tragically ended at an early age because fame -- or the loss of it -- was too painful to endure			1
or -- and this is my sincere hope -- @entity1 can follow the lead of fame addicts who use their name recognition to call attention to pressing social or political issues and push for positive change			1
a good example of this type of person is @entity96			2
the lyrics of her new hit song " @entity99 " makes this point abundantly clear			0
" i live for the applause ... live for the way that you cheer and scream for me			0
" we 've seen @entity96 wear a dress made of real meat and be carried to an awards show in a large egg pod			2
just this week , at the release party for her new album , she wore a dress that had mini-helicopter - type rotors attached to it so she could fly around the room			0
but @entity96 has also used her fame for more than just self - promotion			1
this week while @entity1 was smoking a joint on stage , @entity96 was opening up about her addiction to marijuana			1
she admitted that at one time she smoked 15 - 20 joints a day			0
she talked about her struggles in overcoming addiction			0
@entity96 offered a sobering cautionary tale for young people that marijuana may turn out to be more than recreational fun -- it could consume your life			2
and for years , @entity96 has used her fame to sway public opinion on gay rights			1
she called on president @entity135 to support marriage equality years before he finally did			0
she also pushed for an end to the military 's " @entity139 " policy			0
of course , while she was advocating for changes she was getting plenty of media coverage			0
it 's a win - win situation			1
so , @entity1 , twerk all you want , but in between your publicity binges , why not also talk about issues that demand more attention , such as domestic violence , child poverty , gun safety , etc. ? think of it as : " twerking for a cause			2
" believe me , the press will love it and so will the people you are helping			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : like many stars , @entity1 is addicted to fame
@entity160 : there is no incentive for @entity1 to change , but what path will she take ?
he says @entity1 should follow the likes of @entity96 , who use fame to fight for social justice
@entity160 : it 's a win - win situation ; the media will love @entity1 all the more for it
