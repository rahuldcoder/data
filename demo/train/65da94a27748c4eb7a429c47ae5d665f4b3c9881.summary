-- " and the title of the sole survivor of ' survivor : @entity4 ' goes to ... @entity5			0
" with that , the winner of the 20th season of @entity9 ' " survivor " was announced last night at the @entity11 in @entity12			2
it 's been 10 years since the show crowned its first winner , @entity16 , earning @entity16 $ 1 million , a @entity17 -- and status as @entity20 's newest celebrity			1
@entity16 's fame was fickle : the celebrity spotlight , legal problems and a prison term for tax evasion took their toll on the love - to - hate - him corporate trainer			2
but " @entity8 " came out of that first season as the country 's no. 1 show -- and though ratings have never hit the peaks of the frenzied summer of 2000 , it 's been an unqualified success for its network , @entity9 , and producer @entity38			1
still , 10 years ? the idea that " @entity8 " would last a decade was not something that even host @entity41 would have put his money on			1
" i would 've lost everything i owned today by betting that we would not still be on - air , " said @entity41			0
" in fact , i was so naive to how television really worked that i just assumed because the show was really popular in the first season that it would get a second season for sure ... then i thought this will probably go on for three seasons which is pretty good			2
i 'll make some money , be a tv host			0
i had no idea we 'd be doing this 20 seasons later , " @entity41 told @entity0			0
" @entity8 " debuted in may 2000 when @entity57 veteran and eco-adventurer @entity38 bought the rights from @entity61 producer @entity60 to produce the show in the @entity20			1
it was first shown in 1997 in @entity63 under the name of " @entity65			1
" in an interview with @entity69 's @entity68 , @entity9 president @entity66 remembered an early conversation with the prolific producer : " @entity38 told me early on , ' this show is going to last -- do n't worry about a day job for a while			1
' " he was right			0
three months later , the show -- which introduced the novel concept of a group of strangers living together in an island while vying for $ 1 million -- captured the imagination of an audience of 60 million in its very first finale			2
and it could not have found a more perfect winner in the skilled conniver @entity16 , thereby opening up the floodgates to a new decade of reality tv			2
the rest , as they say , is history			0
of course " @entity8 " was n't the first of the reality tv genre -- others like @entity97 ' " @entity96 , " @entity99 's " @entity98 " and @entity101 's " cops " were around long before			1
but it was the first to challenge the face of prime time tv programming and introduce reality tv as mainstream fare for audiences in @entity20 and beyond			1
it made celebrities out of ordinary citizens			0
perhaps the biggest evidence of its success is how it is still a consistent winner in the 8 p.m. prime time slot on thursdays -- a huge achievement considering the increasingly overcrowded reality field			1
" @entity8 " stands out because it possesses the key ingredients of great storytelling , says @entity122 of in the @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 department at the @entity127 ( @entity128 ) , who has a forthcoming book on the history of reality tv			1
producer @entity38 brings a brand of reality known as " dramality " -- a slick style of drama that is part of the show 's identity and success , says @entity122			1
its editors employ strong use of visual metaphors of nature , which parallel the dramas in the tribe			0
for viewers , it presents a group of people facing the challenges of meeting strangers and living in the open , which functions very well as an allegory for social situations that we understand from our lives , @entity122 said			2
" the reason [ the show ] works is because we can see our own social struggles played out on the ' @entity8 ' stage			1
we identify not with particular participants , exactly , but rather with many of the situations that arise			0
much has been written about ' @entity8 ' as a metaphor for office politics , and i agree that that 's certainly an aspect of it , " she said			1
@entity41 recalls how the team had " no idea what to expect " when they were first reviewing tapes from the first season of " @entity8 , " which took place in @entity178			1
" and then there was this exact moment when @entity16 was sitting on the tree and he was saying over and over again , ' we need to talk , we need to talk			0
' and @entity182 , the truck driver from @entity183 , is walking underneath him and she finally says something to the effect of ' where we 're from , we work while we talk ! ' and i think we all went , ' that 's it ! ' " and that was the show -- how do you get along when you 're fighting for a million dollars			1
" the show 's strong casting and the unpredictability of its people is a strong part of its appeal as well			1
its characters are as volatile as the show 's most hated villain , @entity197			1
there is no telling when they 'll call it quits ( @entity203 ) or if they 'll go on to find all the immunity idols known to man ( @entity197 ) or if they 'll step down for two doughnuts and a milkshake ( @entity210 )			0
" no one knows where it 's going -- not even the producers , " said @entity122			2
and then there 's @entity41 himself , the everyman host who was probably best known before the show as the emcee of " @entity219 " on @entity220			1
he 's evolved from weekly torch snuffer to skilled questioner and meticulous observer			2
@entity41 's position in tribal councils should not be underestimated , said @entity122			2
" viewers see him at his best in the studio show at the end of a season , where he turns out to be a good study of human nature which is to say that his insights parallel our own ' intimate knowledge ' of participants , " she said			0
ultimately , " @entity8 " speaks to some of our inner fears , said @entity41			1
the notion of being abandoned on an island is " like a little kid who 's separated from his mom			0
... you 're stranded in a supermarket and you get that feeling of , ' oh my gosh , i 'm alone , ' " he said			0
" [ and ] being voted out is the same as being laid off from your job or being picked last in a basketball game			0
it 's being told : ' i do n't like you			0
' and the idea of ' @entity254 has spoken ' is really just another way of saying , the news is in			0
it 's final and it 's not good			0
" but there 's the dream , too , for contestants and viewers -- the dream that you 'll be the last one standing			0
" everyone fantasizes about being in our place , " says " survivor : @entity273 " winner @entity272 , " and loves imagining what he would do in that situation			0

" @entity8 " debuted in 2000 after @entity38 brought rights from @entity63 's " @entity65 "
show is still a consistent winner in the 8 p.m. @entity20 prime time slot ratings
