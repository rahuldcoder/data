-- dozens of animals , some of them rare , remained missing from @entity7 's only accredited zoo saturday , two days after someone released the creatures into the wild , the zoo 's co-owner said			1
the intruder or intruders also killed about a dozen birds , including a @entity7 swift parrot , said @entity15 , who co-owns @entity16 with her father , @entity17			1
the @entity19 government lists the bird as endangered			2
fewer than 1,000 of the birds remain in the wild , according to the @entity23			0
the death will affect the zoo 's work to increase the bird 's numbers , @entity15 said			1
" it 's very upsetting , " she said			1
the incident happened thursday night			0
@entity17 found an enclosure door open when he arrived at work the next morning , @entity15 said			0
" then it went from there door after door , " @entity15 said			0
the entrances of about 30 enclosures had been flung open , she said			0
the zoo sprang in to action to limit the damage			1
" we had to quickly go through and lock them all up , " @entity15 said			0
" we spent the last two days to recapture the animals			1
" particularly painful was the release of the park 's population of quolls , a rare indigenous mammal zoo officials were trying to replenish in captivity , @entity15 said			1
like kangaroos , quolls are marsupials and carry their young in pouches			1
but they are much smaller and crawl instead of hopping			0
the zoo also has a @entity57 breeding program , but those animals remained in captivity , @entity15 said			1
some of missing animals will die if not recaptured , @entity15 said			1
" a lot of our animals are in captivity for a reason , " she said			2

" @entity15 said she hopes that many animals will not go far , allowing them to be recovered			2
" they know where home is , " she said			0
the incident has placed a financial strain on the zoo , which receives no government funding			2
it will cost up to 2,000 @entity19 dollars ( $ 2,111 ) to replace each of the birds killed in the incident , @entity15 said			2
" we are privately owned and operated , " @entity15 said			0
" it has taken us nine years to get where we are now			0
" the zoo " takes up about 15 -- 20 acres " and boasts a variety of animal life , but birds appear to be a particular specialty			2
" we have over 80 species of birds , " @entity15 said			0
@entity16 has no idea who might be behind the rampage , hoping police will make progress or someone from the public will come forward with a tip. fans of the zoo have called to offer words of comfort , @entity15 said , but so far no leads .			1
