-- @entity1 kickstarted his @entity3 title defense on sunday as he won the @entity4 @entity3 for the third year in a row			0
the @entity7 motorcyclist overtook pole sitter @entity8 at the first corner at @entity11 and never surrendered the lead as he trimmed his rival 's championship advantage to 12 points after five races			1
" i knew it was going to be a really hard race because it got much hotter than it had been in the morning , " @entity17 told the @entity3 website			2
" @entity8 was following me for about 13 laps , but on the 13th i pushed a little bit more -- to be about three - tenths faster -- and it seems he gave up a little bit , so it was much easier from then			2
" @entity8 had to fight off his rookie @entity28 teammate @entity27 , who dropped to third in the standings after suffering another one of the crashes that had marred his practice and qualifying sessions -- and this time ended his race			1
@entity8 claimed second place ahead of @entity38 's @entity37 , with @entity41 rider @entity40 fourth to match his best career result			1
" i did n't feel fully comfortable in the race today , but i 'm happy because i was able to gain a large number of points , " said @entity8 , who had won the two previous races in his native @entity7 and @entity44 , and was second at @entity11 last year			1
" in general , this was a difficult weekend			0
the back tire was giving me a lot of problems with grip but taking 20 points from this race and maintaining the lead the @entity56 is something positive			0
" @entity27 had been aiming to become the first newcomer to finish on the podium in the first five races of a season , but he suffered his seventh crash since stepping up to motorcycling 's elite division			1
" after three difficult days of setbacks and hard work , i finally felt good during the race , " said the 20 - year - old , who dropped 26 points behind @entity8			2
" i do n't fully understand why i crashed , as i lost both the front and the back at the same time and was unable to save it			0
it 's clear that we made a mistake , but we ca n't go looking for excuses			0
" we ca n't forget that this is my first year in the class and i am here to learn how things are in @entity3			0
in spite of everything we were still fighting for second place , which is a reason to be happy			0
" @entity17 's @entity86 teammate @entity85 was another casualty , with @entity4 's seven - time world champion retiring only three corners into the race after being hit by @entity91			1
@entity85 's previous team @entity92 gave the home fans something to cheer as @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 were fifth , sixth and seventh respectively			1
the sixth race of 18 this season is the @entity100 in @entity101 in a fortnight .			0
