-- are the days of @entity1 in entertainment changing their given names to appeal to a broader audience long gone ? that 's what it looks like now that former " @entity16 " star @entity9 has dropped his stage name for birth name @entity9 for @entity14 's @entity13 - centric new action film " @entity15			1
" the film is second in a series after the 2010 film " @entity23 " starring @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			0
in " @entity15 , " @entity20 returns as @entity24 agent @entity23 , recruited by the president of the @entity26 , played by @entity9 , asked to go on a mission to take down a madman revolutionary and eccentric billionaire arms dealer , played by @entity30 , who has come up with a plan to spread war across the world			1
this second installment will star @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43			0
watch the trailer for ' @entity15 ' according to @entity9 's representative , it was his idea to use his birth name for the film			1
however , there 's no confirmation on what spurred the decision or whether @entity9 will stick to @entity9 from now on			1
some call the change ironic in light of comments last year by @entity9 about his heritage			1
" i do n't wake up feeling @entity13			1
i 'm a white guy in @entity26 , i was born in @entity60 and grew up in @entity61 , " he said in a 2012 interview with @entity59			0
" people are either going to see @entity9 's move as pandering or as a smart career move considering the film 's audience			1
i see it as him integrating himself into @entity13 culture , " said @entity67 , president of @entity68 , a public relations and marketing agency			1
" i 'm sure he meant what he said in his interview with @entity59 , but that does n't mean hce 's not @entity77 , so if he wants to acknowledge it now , i applaud that			2
" the film 's @entity81 page has also re-tweeted articles about @entity9 changing his name to @entity9 for the movie			1
the movie 's facebook page posted a promotional photo of @entity9 as @entity9 with a caption that reads , " call him @entity9			1
@entity9 is going @entity13 in @entity15			1
share this to introduce @entity9 to your friends			1
" on @entity95 , @entity94 posted : " i love that he is using his real name , " while @entity97 disagreed , posting , " so , he 's finally getting in touch with his @entity101 roots ... sorry , ' @entity9 ' you should 've stuck with your brother @entity102 who did n't deny his roots to get more work			1
" @entity105 , editor - in - chief of @entity106 for @entity1 , said : " hispanics might feel that his move might be a bit opportunistic on his part because he had many chances to embrace his @entity13 identity in the past			1
especially since @entity9 's brother , @entity114 , has embraced his @entity77 identity from the very beginning			1
" the @entity9 / @entity9 family has been at odds over their identity over the years			2
in a 2003 " @entity122 " interview , @entity120 talked about why he dropped his birth name , @entity120 , but how he was always proud of his @entity77 heritage			2
he said he felt a " hesitation whenever he would give his name over the phone for a job or apartment " and by the time he would get there in person , " it was always gone " so he made up the name @entity120			0
" it 's still @entity9 officially			1
it 's on my driver 's license and passport and everything , " @entity120 said to @entity136			2
" in fact , one of my great regrets is that i did n't keep my name as it was given to me			0
" @entity9 passed on " @entity9 " to his four children : @entity102 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity9 ( @entity9 )			2
@entity9 wrote a memoir with his son @entity102 called " along the way , " which covers the family 's roots in @entity154 and their relationship as father and son			1
" i chose to stay with my family name because , first of all , @entity114 looks stupid			0
right ? and it 's just not who i am , man , " @entity114 said in an interview with @entity160			2
" the @entity13 community has always been very supportive of that choice and very proud of me that i chose to go with that -- and honor my @entity13 roots			2
" but he said he faced pressure from executives to change his name			0
he said his father 's best advice was to not make the same mistake he made , because he would regret it for the rest of his life			2
" the gringos and the suits in @entity178 gave me some pressure to change it because it made their jobs more difficult to try and sell me , but i 'm so proud that i did n't			0
and , now of course it 's very fashionable to be @entity13			1
i guess it was a good choice back then ! " @entity120 was n't the only actor in @entity178 to change his name			0
@entity185 , @entity184 was @entity184			0
the " @entity187 " star not only changed her hair color -- from natural dark brown to dark red -- but also her name to help her land a broader range of roles			0
perhaps @entity194 , known by @entity178 as @entity194 , would have never made the big screen had she kept her original name			0
@entity197 of " @entity198 " adopted her stepfather 's name , @entity201 if she 'd kept her father 's name , she would be @entity204 after her @entity206 father , @entity205			0
let 's not forget family comedy classic " @entity209 , " starring tv mom @entity210 , whose birth name was @entity210			2
@entity212 , born @entity214 - @entity213 , is a two - time @entity216 - winning @entity215 - @entity26 actor and writer best known for his roles in " @entity219 ! " in 1952 and " @entity220 " in 1956			0
in the 1950s , upon getting a record deal , @entity221 was asked to change his name , then @entity224 , by his manager because of fear that mainstream @entity26 would n't be receptive to the @entity215 - @entity26 rock star			0
" i can understand why @entity120 would have pressure to change his name because he went into @entity178 at a different time , " said @entity106 editor @entity105			0
" it would be easier to see why @entity120 had to change versus @entity9 's situation			1
it 's 2013 , @entity1 have been hot about 10 times			1
" about 10 years ago , @entity105 worked at @entity160 when " everybody wanted to be @entity13			2
" she recalls getting constant calls from @entity238 agencies pitching their clients who were n't latino but wanted to be in the magazine because they wanted to be affiliated with the audience			0
" his name change attests to a greater trend			0
@entity178 is starting to see that @entity1 in the @entity26 are not just foreigners who do n't speak @entity246 , but a viable audience full of influencers that are a part of @entity26 culture , " she said			1
@entity1 are the fastest growing and largest minority group in the country , 50 million strong , according to the @entity253			2
and , according to the @entity255 , that number is only going to grow -- a projected 133 million by 2050			0
plus , @entity77 have $ 1.2 trillion in purchasing power , which is growing at a faster rate than every other minority 's buying power , according to @entity261			0
to top it off , @entity1 love going to the movies , in fact more than any other demographic group			2
in 2012 , the number of @entity77 moviegoers increased by 12 % , according to @entity268 , and they accounted for 25 % of all movies seen even while they are 18 % of the moviegoing population			0
" i ca n't help but wonder if @entity14 is trying to give @entity9 a chance to re-embrace his identity			2
i just hope @entity9 's not just trying to use his culture to get all eyes on him since @entity1 are such a hot commodity right now , " said @entity105			1
" latinos take their heritage and their celebrities very seriously			0
" @entity67 thinks @entity26 has embraced a culture where it is easy to be outraged and offended			0
@entity9 's name change should focus on one thing , he said : @entity26 culture is changing and becoming more latinized			1
" there are bigger things to worry about like undocumented families being torn apart , poverty among @entity13 families , etc. now that 's something to be offended about , " said @entity67 , " it seems like @entity14 is using this film to turn convention on its head			1
it 's kitschy , funny and innovative			0
we should go with it			0

@entity9 has dropped his stage name to birth name , @entity9 , for upcoming flick
" people are going to see @entity9 's move as pandering or as a smart career move "
are the days of @entity1 changing their names to appeal to a broader audience over ?
" if you say ' i am @entity13 , ' celebs have to think about what kind of *message* that sends back "
