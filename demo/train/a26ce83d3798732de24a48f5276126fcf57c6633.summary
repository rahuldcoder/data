-- in a letter to the @entity3 disclosed wednesday , the @entity1 said it has received several requests for an antitrust investigation into the current @entity7 system , and it wants information to help it decide what to do			1
that controversial system makes it very difficult for teams in some athletic conferences to qualify for major bowl games , potentially costing millions of dollars in revenue to those not chosen			1
" serious questions continue to arise suggesting that the current @entity7 system may not be conducted consistent with the competition principles expressed in federal antitrust laws , " assistant attorney general @entity17 told @entity3 president @entity18			1
the decision to release the letter came hours after sen. @entity25 , @entity26 , a major opponent of the current system , demanded further consideration of the issue in a face - to - face appearance with attorney general @entity31 at a @entity33 hearing			1
@entity31 responded by disclosing the @entity1 had sent a letter to the @entity3 on the issue tuesday			2
in her letter , @entity36 asked @entity18 to explain why college football does not have a playoff when so many other college sports do			2
she also asked what steps , if any , the @entity3 has taken to create a playoff , and whether the @entity3 has determined that there are aspects of the @entity7 system that do not serve interests of fans , colleges , universities , and players			1
officials acknowledge the @entity3 is not legally required to respond , although lawyers following the case expect the association to do so			0
antitrust lawyers have been watching the debate grow for more than two years , to see whether the @entity1 will jump into the case			0
one antitrust expert who declares himself neutral in the case says he doubts @entity1 will launch a probe because it has a full plate of more pressing issues			0
" there is a problem , but not an antitrust problem , " said @entity66 of the @entity68 firm @entity69			0
a court could never require a football playoff , but they could break up the current @entity7 system , he said			1
currently , the @entity7 system limits automatic bids to the winners of the @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and the @entity84 , thereby leaving out other conferences , including almost all schools in the @entity87			2
only two remaining at - large spots are available to all other colleges and universities			0
