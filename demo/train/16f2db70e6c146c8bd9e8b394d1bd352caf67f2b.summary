-- the moon disappeared from view along the @entity4 @entity3 on saturday amid a total lunar eclipse			1
images from @entity7 , @entity8 , showed the moon 's crescent waning from a @entity13 cat 's grin to a shadowy sliver before disappearing entirely in the night sky			2
all of the @entity4 was able to see some portion of the event , though the @entity3 had " a more complete view " and was able to see the totality -- the time when the @entity21 's shadow completely covers the moon			1
the totality on the @entity3 was timed as the moon sets and the sun rises , @entity24 said			2
" a lunar eclipse occurs when @entity21 is directly between the sun and the moon , blocking the sun 's rays and casting a shadow on the moon			1
as the moon moves deeper and deeper into @entity21 's shadow , the moon changes color before your very eyes , turning from gray to an orange or deep shade of red , " the @entity24 website said			1
" the moon takes on this new color because sunlight is still able to pass through @entity21 's atmosphere and cast a glow on the moon			1
our atmosphere filters out most of the blue colored light , leaving the red and orange hues that we see during a lunar eclipse			2
if there are additional dust particles in the atmosphere , the moon will appear to be a darker shade of red , " @entity24 said			0
@entity0 ireporter @entity63 took time - lapse video images of the eclipse from his condo on the 17th floor in @entity69 , @entity70			0
