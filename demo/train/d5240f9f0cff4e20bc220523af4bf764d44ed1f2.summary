watching from the observers ' gallery last week , i could see @entity5 opposition leader @entity4 moving from hope , to exasperation and then finally to anger as the country 's highest court dismissed his defense team 's arguments against his sodomy conviction			1
after his appeal was denied on all counts , the sentencing hearing started -- and @entity4 took the gloves off , declaring the incident was a " complete fabrication " and a " political conspiracy " and attacking the five @entity22 judges for becoming " partners in the crime for the murder of judicial independence and integrity			1
" the judges were n't having any of that , and abruptly stood up and walked out of the courtroom to deliberate in chambers on @entity4 's fate , leaving a stunned courtroom behind them			0
@entity4 now faces five years in prison to contemplate the question that is on the minds of many @entity5 , which is how could a government get away with prosecuting a former deputy prime minister and the head of the opposition not once , but twice , for violating an archaic @entity42 colonial law against sodomy that has been invoked a total of only seven times since 1938 ? has the @entity5 government so clearly lost the plot that even outside observers would recognize that the trial was blatantly political from day one ? within minutes of the verdict being issued , the @entity5 government issued a polished statement proclaiming the country 's " judicial independence " and demanding " all parties involved to respect the legal process and the judgment			1
" in case anyone did n't get the memo , there is the rapidly growing crackdown on dissent and free speech in @entity5 led by the top police officer -- who patrols the @entity66 like a shark in open water and tweets orders to the police to arrest lawyers , activists and politicians using the country 's draconian @entity74			1
a tweet by the cartoonist @entity77 referencing " lackeys in black robes " has already landed him in court			0
this is supposed to be a big year for @entity5 , serving as chair of the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) when the @entity86 is to become a reality , and holding a seat at the @entity89			2
@entity5 is also a key partner in the @entity92 - driven @entity91 ( @entity91 ) trade proposal that has gone to the top of the @entity96 legislative agenda , and it was prime minister @entity98 who president @entity96 invited for a round of golf in @entity101 during the president 's @entity103 holiday			2
whether the political persecution of @entity4 was raised on the course has yet to come out			0
but there is huge gap between @entity5 's international engagements as a so - called " moderate " @entity111 - majority nation and its domestic repression of opponents that sadly does n't usually garner much attention -- except in instances when @entity5 imprisons a figure like @entity4 who is widely respected and known internationally			2
so few people know @entity98 's government has been on a tear against his opponents since the 2013 elections , during which the ruling @entity124 coalition lost the majority vote to the @entity4 - lead @entity127 coalition but maintained power because of gerrymandered election districts for parliamentary seats			0
since then the government has been wielding the @entity74 like a hammer , using its undefined terminology barring " any seditious words " or " seditious tendency " that would " bring into hatred or contempt or excite disaffection against any @entity140 or against any government			0
" in the past two years , more than a dozen senior politicians and activists have been dragged into court for saying or tweeting things the government did n't like , and a number have fled overseas to seek asylum -- and the list is going to keep growing			2
@entity98 affirmed at the 2014 congress of the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) party that he leads that he 's planning to strengthen the @entity74 further when the @entity153 reconvenes in march			0
crackdowns on peaceful assemblies , restrictions on the media , censorship of books and films , and targeting of ethnic and religious minorities are also on the rise in @entity98 's @entity5			0
@entity164 , the same @entity151 lawyer brought into as a special prosecutor in @entity4 's case also serves as @entity5 's representative to the regional human rights body , the @entity169 ( @entity170 ) , and asserts how he has prevented any discussions of lgbt rights there			1
@entity5 is brewing a heady concoction of authoritarianism and intolerance that should be setting off alarm bells in world capitals like @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , and @entity182			1
@entity4 's conviction last week may be a new low for the @entity5 government 's rights record , but it should not be seen in isolation from the growing intolerance for civil and political rights emanating from @entity190			1
the wider international community -- be it @entity5 's allies , foreign business investors , and the @entity195 -- should wake up and recognize that the @entity5 government is changing and not for the better			1
it 's time to support @entity5 's human rights defenders , and recognize that if the world wants a democratic , rights - respecting @entity5 , it 's going to have to fight for it .			0
