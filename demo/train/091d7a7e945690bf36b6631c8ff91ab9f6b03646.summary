@entity0 , @entity1 -- look out @entity3 : @entity4 is n't just about sharing arty photos anymore			1
on thursday , the company announced its 130 million monthly users will now be able to shoot and share 15 - second videos , dressed up with one of 13 special filters			1
the new video feature was made available to all @entity12 and @entity14 @entity4 users around the world thursday as a free update to the existing @entity4 app. the basic look of the app is the same , but a small movie icon has been added that takes you into video mode			1
the changes were announced by @entity4 co-founder and ceo @entity26 during a press event at the headquarters of @entity29 , which bought @entity4 last year			2
" it 's everything we know and love about @entity4 , but it moves , " @entity26 said			2
the video - sharing feature was widely expected and puts @entity4 in direct competition with @entity3 , the popular @entity36 - owned app that lets users share looping six - second video clips			1
@entity3 has skyrocketed in popularity in the six months since it launched , attracting more than 13 million users			1
many of the six - second videos have a unique look and feel , employing fast cuts and stop - motion animations to tell quirky little stories			2
@entity3 , @entity4 and the rise of bite - sized video on @entity4 , the videos can be between three and 15 seconds long and include any number of individual video clips			1
but the coolest feature may come after you shoot the video : 13 brand - new filters , created by an artist specifically for @entity4 video			1
they do the usual tweaks to make video pop , like adding vignettes , upping the contrast and playing with color			0
there is also an image - stabilization feature to even out shaky videos shot on the go			2
for now , videos can only be shot from within the @entity4 app , and there is no way to upload existing video from your phone 's camera roll			1
the 15 - second limit was chosen after testing different times , said @entity26 , who called it the right balance " between not too short that it constrains your creativity " and not so long that you have to wait a while for a file to upload			1
in its two and a half years , @entity4 has hosted 16 billion photos , @entity26 said			2
users post 1 billion likes a day , and 130 million people use the service each month , he said			0
@entity90 built up to the announcement with some flowery language about the significance of the new product			0
" it 's a powerful way to learn about new concepts , ideas and causes that move the world forward in a significant way , " he said			0
" it 's our collective belief that the world is better off collected and shared permanently			0
" not to be outdone , @entity3 seems to be readying some new features itself			0
the app 's co-founders posted several @entity108 wednesday that suggest users will soon have the ability to save drafts , splice bits of multiple @entity108 together and browse content based on categories and genres			0
the video - sharing news is the latest step in @entity29 's quest to conquer mobile devices			0
the company has worked hard to increase revenue from mobile ads , which now make up 30 % of the company 's ad revenue			0
