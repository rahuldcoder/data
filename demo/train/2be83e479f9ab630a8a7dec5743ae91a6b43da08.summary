-- former military leader @entity1 took the oath of president sunday and was greeted by a stock market rally of 4.7 %			1
this move to military rule is seen as a path to stability and predictability that investors are craving for -- the @entity11 is up over 75 % in the past 12 months and a whopping 137 % since the low point at the end of 2011			1
but make no doubt about it , the country 's former military chief has a steep hill to climb to get @entity20 's economy back on track			1
unemployment , the budget deficit and inflation are currently running between 11 - 13 % , making it difficult for @entity1 to maneuver			1
the president and his new cabinet will need to push forward with structural and tax reforms to attract foreign direct investment			0
he has hired external consultants to advise on jump - starting growth , which closed out the 4th quarter of 2013 with a meager expansion of just under 1.5 %			0
@entity34 , director of @entity35 for @entity36 said on a recent visit to the @entity38 that " investors are worried about the ability of having a president and government that will be able to build consensus around reforms			2
" companies want to be able to tap the region 's most populous country of 85 million consumers , but according to @entity34 they worry those efforts may be " further interrupted by political volatility and instability			2
" monetary insurance there are a trio of countries that have stepped in to provide a monetary insurance policy for @entity20			1
they have been so active since the ouster of former president @entity60 that they are now referred to as the @entity62 ( @entity63 ) or @entity64			0
@entity65 , @entity66 and the @entity67 share two common traits : a disdain for the @entity70 ( and its affiliates in the @entity72 ) and vast oil surplus funds to try and solve political challenges			0
together they have pumped in an initial $ 12 billion and there is a great deal of talk in the market that they are prepared to do so again if needed			0
as of the end of april , @entity20 's foreign exchange reserves stood at $ 17.5 billion -- a three - month supply			1

this year , @entity67 - based developer @entity90 signed a $ 40 billion agreement to build low income housing in @entity20 , and the government put in another $ 5 billion to construct wheat silos to reduce wastage of their grain crops			1
these governments and their entities , sources say , do n't plan to be the lenders of last resort forever and this time they may not have to			0
last thursday , @entity104 managing director @entity103 talked on the phone with @entity1 and expressed her organization 's commitment to helping the country in its transition period			1
the sticking point over the last three years of " on again , off again " talks has been a willingness to bite the bullet on economic reforms			0
after the @entity117 chaos , this may be the former military leader 's toughest test			2
he needs to illustrate to his @entity72 partners and the @entity104 he has the mettle to deliver painful reforms and keep @entity20 on his side .			2
