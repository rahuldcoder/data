@entity20 , @entity21 : the @entity5 is in session , and so is this edition of @entity0			1
bringing you today 's commercial - free headlines , i 'm @entity27			1
first up : leaders talk @entity29 @entity30 : first up , representatives from nearly 200 countries come together in @entity33 to talk about global issues			1
this is called the @entity5 , and the decisions and resolutions that it makes set the agenda for a lot of what the @entity5 works on throughout the year			1
one of the biggest focuses for this gathering is climate change			1
secretary general @entity45 calls it one of the most important issues of the 21st century			1
he 's hoping that countries will work on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , which many scientists believe contribute to climate change			1
during speeches yesterday , president @entity53 and @entity55 president @entity54 , who lead the countries that give off the most greenhouse gases , pledged to try to reduce them			1
neither leader offered a specific timeframe for this , but both said they plan to cut greenhouse gases and increase the use of clean energy sources			1
president @entity53 also touched on another controversial issue yesterday : the @entity69 - @entity68 conflict			1
peace talks between the two groups have fizzled out recently , but @entity53 is urging both sides to come back to the negotiating table and work on a permanent solution			1
he met with @entity68 president @entity75 and @entity69 prime minister @entity76 yesterday in an effort to restart discussions between these two			1
@entity9 president @entity53 : despite all the mistrust , we have to find a way forward			1
we have to summon the will to break the deadlock that has trapped generations of @entity69 and @entity68 in an endless cycle of conflict and suffering			1
@entity87 @entity88 , @entity89 : this has been a 48 - hour ordeal that people had been , stayed here and to care for the safety of people			1
i just want to thank them			1
i want to thank those firefighters and first responders all across @entity100 , from the east and @entity102 , to the west in @entity104 and @entity105 and @entity106 , and in @entity107 in northwest @entity100			1
this has been a huge effort			1
@entity110 @entity30 : okay , that was @entity100 's gov. @entity88 there , talking about severe flooding that has led to at least eight deaths			1
noting that nearly all of those were from drivers and passengers who were swept away by floodwaters , gov. @entity88 pleaded with residents to stay off the roads until the waters recede			2
yesterday , he planned to ask president @entity53 to declare a federal emergency in order to free up money that would help with the relief efforts			2
with flash flood watches stretching across parts of the southeastern @entity9 , @entity127 examines the impact of this severe weather			1
( @entity132 ) @entity133 , @entity134 : it 's a cruel irony			2
after months of drought , heavy rains spawning deadly floods			2
across much of the southeast , streets are covered			2
tranquil creeks now on a rampage			2
in some places near @entity146 , nearly two feet of rain fell			2
@entity147 : this is the highest water that i 've seen , and i 've been living around here all my life			2
@entity151 : this couple was rescued by boat in the pitch black			2
they had to use flashlights to see			2
and the only thing they could bring with them : their dog and a few family treasures			2
@entity162 : these are my wedding pictures			2
@entity151 : but they were luckier than others , others who lost something so much more dear			2
in @entity100 , right now , 17 counties under a state of emergency			2
officials say they 're in rescue and recovery mode , but those rescues , especially around @entity146 , have been slow and difficult			2
pictures showing just how crippled some areas of the city are			2
in the western suburb of @entity180 , a house is left to burn			2
next to it , a fire truck stranded , helpless in the rising floodwaters			2
these two men had to get around on inflatable mattresses , and so many people are stunned by what they 're seeing			2
@entity162 : right now , shock			0
i do n't think it 's really set in that this is real			0
this is , we 're flooded out			0
we do n't have a home			0
@entity151 : @entity127 , @entity0 , @entity195 , @entity100			0
( @entity196 ) @entity30 : for another perspective , look at this ! this is the amusement park , @entity200 and under water			0
it 's located west of @entity146 , and what you 're seeing here is a coaster called the @entity207			0
i think i 've ridden this thing every time i 've been to six flags			0
from the looks of it , i wo n't be doing that again anytime soon			0
impact your world @entity30 : obviously , the relief efforts are going to be going on for a while			1
several organizations are already at work			0
to find out how you can take part , head to the @entity226 section on our home page and click on the " @entity230 " link			0
@entity231 @entity232 , @entity21 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a @entity235 nation located between @entity236 and @entity237			0
i gained my independence from @entity240 in 1821			0
my capital city is @entity242			0
i 'm @entity243 , and i 'm home to about 7.8 million people			0
ousted president @entity30 : political turmoil has led to clashes in that capital city , all based around @entity243 president @entity251			0
he was actually removed from office back in june and faces charges of violating the country 's constitution			0
@entity251 , who 's in the white hat in the middle of your screen here , returned to @entity243 monday			0
he took up refuge in the @entity264 embassy in @entity242			0
if he leaves , the @entity243 government says it will arrest him			0
the @entity264 embassy is n't considered part of @entity243 , so @entity251 ca n't be arrested as long as he stays inside			0
police and soldiers positioned outside the embassy clashed with @entity251 's supporters before clearing the area yesterday			0
the situation has led the @entity9 to close its embassy in the @entity243 capital			1
troops in @entity11 @entity30 : meantime , the president of @entity11 says he supports a top @entity9 commander 's call to increase the number of @entity9 troops in the @entity283 country			1
president @entity284 called it " the right approach			0
" but it 's certainly not the only one			0
as @entity290 explains , there are several ideas on how to fight the war in @entity11 , and who that war should be against			1
( begin video ) @entity296 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : as violence increases daily in @entity11 , some are calling for a major troop build - up			1
the president signaling when he ordered a review of the @entity11 war , he was n't anxious to quickly send tens of thousands of additional troops to @entity11 to fight the @entity305 insurgency			1
@entity53 : let 's do a soup - to - nuts re-evaluation , focusing on what our original goal was , which was to get @entity311 , the people who killed 3,000 @entity9			1
@entity313 : attacking @entity311 is fundamentally a counter-terrorism strategy , requiring a limited number of new troops			0
it 's the " @entity320 " advocated by some in the @entity322 , according to a senior @entity319 official			0
but gen. @entity323 , the top commander , is still calling for a counterinsurgency strategy to strengthen @entity11 to the point the @entity305 have no safe haven there			1
that could take tens of thousands of more troops beyond the 68,000 now planned			0
retired gen. @entity329 says it 's a must			0
) , @entity9 army : if you 're going to get the tribes over on your side and the side of government , you have to have enough people there to make things happen for them , economically , socially and in terms of security			1
@entity313 : could the @entity319 put @entity9 firepower , such as fighter jets and drones , in neighboring countries to reduce the @entity9 presence inside @entity11 ? @entity348 : my point is , if you do n't have the kind of intelligence you need to make those systems effective , you are going to swing and miss a lot			1
@entity313 : the powerful chairman of the @entity356 says more @entity9 troops right away are not the answer for another reason			1
sen. @entity360 ( @entity361 ) , chairman , armed services committee : i 've been recommending to the president that , first of all , before any consideration is made of additional combat forces , that we get the @entity11 army bigger , better equipped			1
@entity313 : the new bottom line ? support for the war in @entity11 is declining , and the president and his commanders will have to make the case for whatever comes next			1
@entity290 , @entity0 , the @entity319			0
( @entity377 ) promo @entity30 : @entity11 , @entity243 , the southeastern @entity9 : today 's show is all over the map			1
but we 've got a way to help students pinpoint locations that are in the news : our downloadable maps ! these geographic guides offer some perspective on exactly where these headlines are happening			0
you 'll find the free resources every day at @entity391			0
before we go @entity30 : before we go , we 've got a tale of true sportsmanship			0
at the end of a recent high school game in @entity397 , @entity394 took a handoff and hightailed it all the way to the end zone , scoring his team 's only touchdown of the day			0
so , why is this noteworthy ? well , @entity394 has @entity403 , a genetic disorder			0
he 's always dreamed of scoring a td			0
so , with the clock winding down and his team down 46 - 0 , @entity394 's coach wanted to give him that chance			0
he talked to the other team 's coach , who agreed to give up the shutout and let @entity394 score			0
goodbye @entity30 : great story			0
we 'd love to hear your thoughts on it			0
would you give up a shutout to help someone out ? would you have done it for @entity394 ? @entity423 to our blog at @entity422 and share your opinions			1
