-- in february , when @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 arrived at the @entity5 in @entity8 ' @entity7 neighborhood , they had three days booked and zero songs to record			1
" i thought i was going there to add some guitars or harmonies on @entity3 's album , " says @entity4 , who was invited to the session by @entity2 , whom he befriended at a skate park in @entity12			1
" when i got to the studio , i saw @entity18 and asked , ' what songs are we going to do ? ' he said we had n't written them yet			2
" after three long days , the trio had recorded the nine acoustic tracks that make up " @entity24 " -- and called themselves @entity26 , after the track of the same name			1
" i never thought we 'd pull off an entire album , [ i thought ] maybe we 'd get an ep , " says @entity2 , who credits @entity3 as the catalyst who pushed for three songs a day			2
" the three of us were able to create something we never could have done on our own			2
" with three acoustic guitars and three microphones , the team worked out musical arrangements , and then retreated to different corners of the studio to write			1
" we were each others ' lyric police , " says @entity3			2
( " it was very ' wilbury ' style , " says @entity4 , whose late father @entity44 was a member of the @entity45			2
) many times , @entity4 threw out lyrical themes for inspiration			0
" @entity57 " is a throwback to @entity53 's " @entity52 , " imagining a world where people are immediately accountable for their actions			0
when @entity4 called for a blues number , the trio quickly drafted " @entity60			1
" says @entity3 : " it 's really about the three of our voices , and the harmonies			0
we 're basically singing together the whole time			0
" with nine acoustic and vocal tracks completed , @entity4 was determined to ratchet the music up to another level			1
he instinctively called the legendary session drummer @entity69 , an old family friend			0
" i 'd never done anything that i thought was worthy of calling @entity69 , " says @entity4			0
" we had an emotional conversation on the phone , and he heard some of the stuff we 'd done , and he said he 'd do it			0
" @entity69 overdubbed percussion , @entity3 added bass , and @entity2 ( who calls @entity69 the " @entity78 of the drums " ) added some slide guitar			0
" these guys are so talented , " says @entity4 of his bandmates , who will all hit the road together in october			1
