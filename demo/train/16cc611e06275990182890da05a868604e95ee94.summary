@entity0 -- in what have become known as the " @entity5 pencil " and " candy cane " cases , the @entity2 refused monday to consider appeals from the families of elementary school students over distribution of religious - themed gifts on campus			1
at issue was whether school officials can be sued for violating the @entity17 rights of what the students claimed was their " private , non-curricular speech based solely upon its religious viewpoint			1
" a federal appeals court had ruled in favor of school officials in @entity26 , @entity27 , on the liability question , and the justices without comment let that decision stand			1
the full 16 - judge panel from the @entity34 - based court last september concluded while the constitutional rights of the students were violated , school administrators could not be sued under the " qualified immunity " legal standard			1
the litigation continues on other aspects of two separate incidents nine years ago , both involving schools at the @entity44 in the @entity46 suburb			0
" educators should not suffer personal monetary liability for making a mistake in this area of the law , " said the appeals judges			0
in one instance , the principal of @entity54 blocked then - third - grader @entity56 from handing out " goody bags " at a winter party			0
the bags included a decorative pen in the shape of a candy cane with a @entity64 message that read in part : " every time you see a candy cane , remember the message of the candy maker : @entity5 is the @entity5 ! " parents had met with principal @entity72 , who offered a compromise : the laminated " legend of the @entity75 " pens would not be allowed at the classroom party , but could be distributed separately at a table in the school library			2
school district officials later clarified , saying students in general were not allowed to pass out " any written material , tapes , or other media " to classmates , whatever the message			1
the boy 's mother and father nevertheless brought the pens to the party , and the principal then announced to the school by loudspeaker that all " outside materials " were banned from classroom distribution			2
the family claims @entity56 was the only student subsequently banned from distributing his " goody bags			0
" a month later at @entity101 , the parents of then - second - grader @entity100 complained the girl was forbidden from handing out tickets to a passion play , which was being performed at a local church , depicting the crucifixion of @entity5			2
the student expressed her " sincere " religious conviction she " should share her beliefs with her friends			0
" days later , @entity100 was then stopped from distributing brownies at a party with two pencils attached , one of which was inscribed , " @entity5 loves me this i know from the @entity116			0
" the other pencil had the word " @entity119 " on it			0
her mother then angrily confronted school officials , including principal @entity123			1
@entity124 later testified she left the school offices emotionally upset , and " she thought out loud to herself , ' @entity126 is in the building , ' " according to the court transcript			2
it was unclear to whom she was referring			0
a disagreement developed over whether the school had given permission for the student to give the " @entity5 " pencils after classes that day , outside the school building on the sidewalk			0
a legal question developed whether that distribution was on school property or nearby , and whether authorities would then have power to stop the pencils from being given away			2
the appeals court noted the difficulty government officials have ensuring schools and other public facilities remain free of religious proselytizing			1
" when educators encounter student religious speech in schools , they must balance broad constitutional imperatives from three areas of @entity17 jurisprudence : the @entity2 's school - speech precedents , the general prohibition on viewpoint discrimination , and the murky waters of the @entity162			1
" they must maintain the delicate constitutional balance between students ' free - speech rights and the @entity162 imperative to avoid endorsing religion			1
" the court concluded the principals were entitled to qualified immunity " because clearly established law did not put the constitutionality of their actions beyond debate			0
" school officials had said they are entrusted by parents with the education of children , and retain complete control over all aspects of a student 's time and communications -- including parties and hallway discussions			1
the @entity187 's @entity17 bars any government from passing laws " respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof			0
" the high court in the past has typically dealt with such church - state disputes by allowing ten commandment displays in public buildings ; the mention of " @entity200 " on currency and in the @entity202 ; manger and menorah displays in public parks ; and school and legislature prayer			2
a @entity27 - based legal group had represented the @entity209 and @entity56 families in their appeals			1
" we are disappointed the @entity2 denied review of this case , " said @entity211 , director of litigation of @entity213			0
" we were hoping to finally put this issue to rest : that government school officials should be held accountable when they violate the law and students ' first amendment rights			1
no student should be subjected to religious discrimination by the government			0
" while the students ' " speech " in these cases involved a religious message , the high court has also established important precedent on the larger free speech issue			2
in the famous " @entity233 " case from 1969 , the @entity2 ruled two @entity235 high school students could continue wearing @entity237 armbands			1
the high court said students do not " shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse door			1
" but school administrators do retain the authority to restrict any activity that would cause a " substantial disruption " of the school 's educational mission			0
the current cases are @entity56 v. @entity72 ( 11 - 804 ) , and @entity72 v. @entity56 ( 11 - 941 ) .			0
