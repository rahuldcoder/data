" @entity2 spokesman @entity20 said monday that his agency " will be investigating the matter and will conduct the appropriate follow up			1
" the false tweets were taken down from the site after being up for hours			2
one of the tweets from @ @entity27 said @entity9 was " shot twice at a @entity29 ' restaurant in @entity30 while campaigning			0
@entity9 , best regards to the @entity9 family			0
" " we wish @ joebiden the best of luck as our new @entity36			0
in such a time of madness , there 's light at the end of tunnel , " the last in the series of tweets said later			0
an article on @entity1 confirmed the hack			2
" hackers sent out several malicious and false tweets claiming that president @entity9 had been assassinated , " it said			1
" those reports are incorrect , of course , and the president is spending the july 4 holiday with his family			2
" the hacking is being investigated , and @entity1 regrets any distress the false tweets may have created			2
" but six tweets related to the fake news remained on the @entity60 twitter feed hours after the apology was posted			0
later , @entity11 announced the tweets were removed			1
one of the false messages said , " it 's a sad 4th of july ... the shooter will be found			2
" that message encouraged @entity5 users to repost the message on their own @entity5 accounts , which would spread the fake news			1
several users did just that			0
the tweets generated headlines around the world , as well as criticism and mockery on @entity5 , with firebrand liberal tv host @entity78 frantically tweeting to many individual @entity5 users that @entity9 is fine			1
he asked @entity5 users not to re-post the messages			1
the first of the false tweets about @entity9 was posted about 2 a.m. et. the @entity5 messages asserting that @entity9 had been attacked came after a message that said , " just regained full access to our @entity5 and email			1
" a student journalist interviewed someone claiming to be a representative of the hackers shortly before the @entity9 tweets were posted			0
@entity94 of @entity96 's @entity95 reported that the hackers , calling themselves the @entity98 , were an offshoot of the hacker group @entity100			0
" without groups like @entity100 , what is there to prevent corruption ? " he quoted the representative as saying			0
@entity94 interviewed the representative via instant message , contacting an account he said they used to send out the tweets and later deleted			0
he said they had posted several innocuous fake messages before sending the @entity9 tweets , then deleted them			0
he said he could not confirm that the person he interviewed was really one of the hackers but " firmly " believed it , based on the link between fake posts on @entity5 and the instant message account			1
the instant message address he gave to @entity0 for the hackers was offline monday morning			0
the @ @entity5 account had 34,566 followers monday morning but by afternoon had more than 37,000			2
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity122 said the company did not comment on individual accounts , declining to answer questions about whether @ @entity27 had been hacked or why the account of the alleged hackers was suspended			2
hours later , the @entity129 - based technology company issued a statement saying @entity11 has identified that it was first compromised in another way , which in turn allowed for the alleged perpetrators to access the network 's @entity5 account			1
" while @entity5 does monitor accounts for brute - force login attempts and similar methods of attack , we 're unable to anticipate compromises that take place due to offsite behavior , " @entity5 spokesman @entity136 said in its statement			1
@entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity5 says the @entity11 ' hack was due to " offsite behavior " it would *n't* monitor
