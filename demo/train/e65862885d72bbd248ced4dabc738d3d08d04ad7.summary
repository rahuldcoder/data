@entity0 -- the new president of @entity3 is taking the concept of getting work done in the first 100 days in office very seriously			1
@entity7 forced out the long - serving head of the military @entity11 @entity10 , his number two , and a handful of other generals			1
at the same time , @entity7 nullified the constitutional declaration made by the military council before he took office june 30th			1
and while the military wanted to sustain its grip on power , @entity7 was able to wrestle control after what was seen as a military lapse in the @entity25			1
@entity7 is taking a bold stand , ordering counter attacks against militant hideouts over the weekend near @entity29 in @entity25 , after 16 border guards were killed in a surprise attacks when they were breaking fast at sundown during @entity33			1
but the president is going down a tricky road			0
@entity36 , a political economist at the @entity37 , said @entity7 's strategy is particularly difficult since it is " not clear who the enemy is			1
" recent events , he said , provided an early indication of where the @entity25 is headed			2
the attacks , and changes at the top in the military , have far reaching implications -- not the least of which is the attempted rebuilding of the @entity3 economy			1
nearly a year and a half after the uprisings against the 30 year rule of @entity54 , @entity3 is struggling to find its footing			2
the @entity25 may be vast , but scenes of attacks in the north have real potential to spook tourists who were just getting comfortable with coming back to @entity63 resorts in the south			1
blog : was @entity66 's @entity3 visit a mistake ? tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner in the country , but revenues dropped in 2011 to just under $ 9 billion , from $ 12.5 billion the year before the uprisings			1
the southern @entity25 , especially @entity74 , is the main foreign tourist destination			2
there is a genuine cash crunch , with foreign exchange reserves at roughly $ 14 billion -- half the level of early 2011			0
strategists say the cash will last only four months if revenues do n't start coming in at a faster pace			0
the @entity3 government is still pegging growth during the current fiscal year at 3.5 % to 4 % , but economists who closely track the @entity88 and @entity90 region , known as @entity91 , are beginning to mark down expectations			2
@entity93 , of @entity94 , says the security challenge " not only puts the recovery in this particular region on negative outlook , but highlights the volatility of the challenges that this new government and president will face			0
" strategically , it was thought that @entity7 and @entity10 could work together against a common enemy in the @entity25			1
this was expected to include @entity107 tribal leaders who also want to bring their territory under control			0
that plan moves ahead , but @entity10 and his team are not part of it			0

the @entity124 mission is still planning to visit @entity3 this month to jump - start negotiations on a $ 3.2 billion loan program			0
talks took place last spring but there was reluctance to push ahead with that program until a government was in place with a new plan of action			0
knowing the importance of @entity3 to the broader region , @entity137 players with ample oil and gas revenues are stepping up funding			0
@entity144 has said it would inject $ 2 billion into the @entity3 @entity145 , and @entity146 earlier this year pledged a billion dollars			0
candidate @entity7 campaigned on delivering what he called a @entity148 for @entity3 , an economic blueprint that engages wider swaths of society			1
one of the key criticisms of the @entity54 regime was that the reform program started too late in the middle of the last decade and then trickled down too slowly			0
@entity158 based @entity157 , commenting after attacks in @entity25 , said the new government " faces the difficult challenge of striking the right balance between propping up the economy , achieving fiscal consolidation , and improving the socio - economic conditions that helped overturn the old order			2
" the budget deficit could top 9 % this year , but most agree this is not the time for austerity			0
it is a time to wrest back control of the trouble spot on the volatile border with @entity174 and @entity175 and get @entity3 back to work , and the economy growing again .			1

@entity7 's actions towards the military show he is taking a bold stand
but these changes have far reaching implications , including on the economy
attack scenes in the @entity25 also have potential to spook tourists
it 's time to take back control of the trouble spot and get @entity3 back to work
