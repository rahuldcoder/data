-- based on a true story , @entity2 's " @entity7 " is the kind of real - life adventure tale with which anyone who has ever dreamed of truly making a new start can identify			1
how often have you been looking for an apartment or a house , hoping to find that really cool , gothic deconsecrated church , cliff house with a widow 's walk , @entity16 - worthy treehouse or energy self - sufficient @entity18 hole ? whatever your dream fantasy home is , it never shows up on @entity22 , does it ? well , for @entity25 and his two young children , the opportunity to make a fresh start shows up in the form of a slightly run - down farmhouse on 18 acres			1
it just happens to come with a rather down - on - its - luck zoo , complete with a depressed grizzly bear , an aging bengal tiger , an @entity34 lion , porcupines , flamingos and even a binturong , a @entity39 mammal whose musk apparently smells like hot , buttered popcorn			2
as for the humans , @entity43 does a great job as the grieving widower @entity46 , whose wife dies before the film begins			1
@entity46 and @entity50 ( @entity49 ) had one of those storybook romances that we all wish we had ( theirs is told completely in still photos and mostly dialogue - free scenes pulled from @entity46 's memory ) , and the pain is etched clearly on his face			1
his kids are all he has left , but much like @entity63 's @entity62 in " @entity64 , " @entity46 's parenting skills leave little to be desired			1
you see , @entity46 was an adventure writer for a newspaper , the kind of a guy who voluntarily takes assignments that land him in a hurricane hunter airplane			1
kids , on the other hand , can be way worse			0
@entity46 's son @entity74 ( ably played by @entity75 ) is less than happy about , well , everything			1
he 's recently been expelled from school and his behavior ( which includes drawing very disturbing pictures ) is one big reason why @entity46 thinks they all need a fresh start			1
@entity74 and @entity46 are constantly at each other 's throats , and those scenes occasionally err on the side of strident			1
@entity74 's petulance and generally obnoxious behavior are really the film 's only misstep			2
he 's clearly a talented and smart kid , and his inevitable acceptance of his surroundings and new life come about 20 minutes too late			2
but it 's a minor issue as far as the overall film is concerned			2
@entity46 's 7 - year - old daughter , @entity98 , on the other hand , is an absolute joy to watch			1
played by @entity101 , @entity98 lights up the screen every time she appears , and manages to overcome the potential " too cute , too precocious " pitfalls that so many adorable cinema tykes fall prey			0
her sheer joy at the idea that the family has just bought a zoo is infectious			0
i dare you not to find her at least as adorable as the red fox or peacock chicks			0
when @entity46 buys it , the zoo is on its last legs			1
kept together by a small but devoted staff , including head zookeeper @entity118 ( a winning @entity119 ) , zookeeper @entity120 ( @entity121 ) , who is rarely seen without a capuchin monkey on his shoulder , or @entity118 's young cousin @entity124 ( @entity125 ) , who takes an immediate shine to @entity74 , and zoo architect @entity127 ( played with fantastic drunken brio by @entity130 actor @entity129 of " @entity131 " )			0
@entity132 does a spirited turn as @entity46 's levelheaded older brother , @entity134			1
@entity134 is the voice of reason , pleading with @entity46 to do the sensible thing and cut bait when things get tough at the zoo			2
@entity124 's fascination with @entity74 and the evolution of that relationship is yet another winning ingredient in the film ( written by @entity146 and @entity2 )			0
when @entity46 and @entity74 finally get around to working out their differences , the talk they have about romance is one many of us could take to heart			2
yes , this film is a little schmaltzy and sentimental			0
yes , it is , at times , a little precious			0
and no , it does n't break any ground			0
but it 's genuinely funny , sweet and kindhearted , and it 's going to make you feel good			1
considering how stressful the holidays can be , what 's so bad about that ? this film is like an antidote to cynicism			0
" @entity7 " is exactly what it needs to be in this holiday season			2
i started smiling at the beginning , and kept a smile up until the end when , i 'll confess , i was also shedding a few tears			0
do n't mistake this for frothy , insignificant throwaway entertainment			0
this one comes with real emotions that are thoughtfully and carefully presented			0
and , for better or worse , most of us can relate			0
an extremely well - acted , well - written and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours , " @entity7 " is great counterprogramming to some of the heavier ( but also excellent ) end - of - year releases			1
however , i ca n't be responsible if you take the kids and , instead of asking for a puppy or a pony , they up the ante and start asking for an entire zoo			0
" @entity7 " is rated @entity190 and contains a few mild ( and cutely delivered ) expletives .			2

@entity43 plays grieving widower @entity46 in " @entity7 "
the movie is genuinely funny , sweet and kindhearted , our *critic* says
he says it 's great counterprogramming to some of heavier end - of - year releases
