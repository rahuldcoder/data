-- three dozen earthquakes over the past week in central @entity2 shook shelves , rattled nerves and prompted speculation about their cause			2
" are they being being triggered or are they natural ? that 's something we do n't know , " @entity10 scientist @entity9 said sunday			2
the chances of so many temblors in the region in such a short time are " @entity19 kind of odds , " @entity9 said			1
" what was unusual was to have four different areas in the state to be active in the same week			0
" more than two dozen quakes recorded since wednesday have been centered north of @entity25 , @entity2			1
the strongest , on wednesday and thursday nights , had reported magnitudes of 3.5 and 3.4			0
" right now all we 've gotten reports of is shaking stuff and rattling shelves , but people are definitely noticing them , " @entity9 said			0
measuring the magnitude of eathquakes solving the mystery is important because of suspicion the quakes could be related to natural gas exploration nearby using hydraulic fracturing , known as fracking , he said			1
" the best probability at this point is they are natural , but we ca n't rule out the possibility that there may be a relationship , " @entity9 said			1
a swarm of hundreds of earthquakes centered near @entity51 , @entity2 , ended two years ago after state regulators imposed a moratorium on new injection wells in the area			2
two operating injection wells , just outside of the moratorium area , are about 8 miles from some of the quakes			0
" i ca n't say at this time there 's not a connection , but given the distance from those wells , it would be pretty amazing , " @entity9 said			1
one natural explanation would be a fault running through the area that makes a sharp turn , where " you would expect more strain to accumulate , " @entity9 said			0
@entity0 's @entity70 contributed to this report .			0

chances of so many in such a short time are " @entity19 kind of odds , " scientist says
more than two dozen since wednesday were centered near @entity25 , @entity2
one suspect is natural gas exploration using hydraulic fracturing , known as fracking
" we ca n't rule out the possibility that there may be a relationship , " *official* says
