@entity0 , @entity1 -- it would be a mistake to read too much into the speeches , breakout sessions and late - night parties that took place at the annual @entity9			1
thousands of right - leaning activists made the pilgrimage here this year , to a convention hall outside the nation 's capital			2
they were greeted , as they are every year , by a bevy of candidates , bloggers , political operatives and more than a few hucksters out to make a buck			0
but it 's tough to glean any sweeping insight into the state of the conservative movement just by hanging out at @entity9 for a few days and talking to its most rock - ribbed and outspoken partisans			1
and yet : the confluence of big name @entity31 speakers -- many of them potential @entity33 contenders -- makes the three - day event impossible to ignore			1
@entity9 crowd chants , ' @entity35 , @entity36 , run ! ' here are five big takeaways from @entity9 2014 : 1			1
this is @entity40 's house : @entity42 's blowout win in the presidential straw poll saturday -- he won more than a third of the vote , easily besting second - place finisher @entity47 -- cemented his place as the @entity49			1
@entity42 convincingly wins @entity9 straw poll @entity42 's address here on friday , unapologetically heavy with libertarian sentiment , was far and away the best - received speech of the weekend			1
the room was packed and @entity42 , wearing jeans , was interrupted repeatedly by standing ovations			2
after his appearance , he joined his wife , @entity59 , across the street from the convention center at a packed restaurant for an open bar happy hour with fired - up supporters			0
does his showing mean that @entity42 will be the @entity31 nominee in 2016 ? no. but it does affirm what reporters here had been saying all week : that @entity9 is now , without question , his turf			1
@entity9 crowd treats @entity42 like a rock star the face of @entity9 has become younger in recent years -- it feels a little like spring break for @entity77 -- and more libertarian in the process			1
@entity42 also won the straw poll in 2013 , and his father , @entity81 , won in 2010 and 2011			1
the younger @entity42 was aided in his win this year by @entity83 , which boasted that it recruited almost 500 activists to come to the event and cast ballots			1
almost half of the straw poll vote came from 18 - to 25 - year - olds			1
@entity42 's showing this weekend will only add to the perception that he 's a top - tier @entity31 presidential contender who should be taken much more seriously than his father if he runs ( and no one thinks he is n't running )			1
the downside ? the dominant straw poll raises expectations for his performance next year , when the @entity31 race for the @entity33 will be in full swing			1
@entity103 still conservative enemy no. 1 : the national political conversation is already drifting toward 2016			1
but at @entity9 , president @entity103 was anything but a lame duck			1
@entity103 foreign policy target of opportunity at @entity9 speaker after speaker listed @entity103 's unforgivable sins : taxes , spending , @entity114 , the @entity116 scandal , @entity118 surveillance , and on and on			1
strikingly , @entity121 -- the @entity120 's apparent nominee - in - waiting for 2016 -- went mostly unmentioned until friday afternoon , the conference 's second day			1
former @entity124 gov. @entity123 criticized the former secretary of state 's handling of the 2012 attack on the @entity129 mission in @entity130 , @entity131			0
her name popped up twice more from the main stage on saturday			0
rep. @entity134 said @entity135 will face " tough questions " if she runs in 2016			1
former house speaker @entity137 called @entity135 a " prison guard " of the past			2
but @entity103 was far and away the chief bogeyman of @entity9			1
even as pundits scrutinize @entity135 's every move in the context of the next presidential campaign , conservatives are n't yet ready to look beyond the man who still occupies the @entity33			2
@entity147 : time for a little rebellion 3			0
pragmatists vs. purists : there 's always a lot of chatter at @entity9 about the various wings of the @entity31 that seem at odds with one another : the free market adherents , the national security hawks , the social conservatives			1
the growing influence of libertarianism has scrambled how the conservative movement sees itself			0
but political parties in this country have always been uneasy coalitions of various interests and ideologies			0
squabbling is to be expected			0
the biggest battle in the @entity31 is the one between its pragmatists and its purists			2
there were hints this year that the pragmatists were gaining ground			0
in the @entity103 era , @entity9 has earned a reputation for fire - breathing rhetoric and divisive commentary , but some of this year 's biggest speeches had a softer edge			1
@entity183 gov. @entity182 led the charge in calling for party unity in pursuit of winning elections			0
@entity147 hoping for a second chance from voters @entity42 has called on the party to reach out to minorities and has proposed policy ideas -- including sentencing reform and economic " freedom zones " for low - income areas -- to achieve that goal			2
in a session about libertarianism , one panelist said children would be better raised by gay couples than single parents			0
even @entity205 sen. @entity204 , a tea party darling , urged the conservative faithful to be more open - minded			0
" we as conservatives have got to be far more engaged in finding converts than discarding heretics , " @entity204 said on thursday			0
but the happy talk could n't paper over the fact that conservative hard - liners , including several eyeing a 2016 presidential run , do n't want conservative ideology to take a back seat to anything			2
and @entity9 still booked a number of divisive and provocative speakers like @entity223 and @entity134			2
former sen. @entity224 inveighed against win - at - all - costs @entity31 -- a comment widely seen as a jab at @entity182			1
and sen. @entity47 of @entity228 warned republicans against compromise , painting former @entity31 presidential nominees @entity231 , @entity233 and @entity234 as moderate squishes who lost nationally because they veered from conservative principles			2
his words drew a stern rebuke from @entity233 -- and a rare statement from @entity231 telling @entity47 to check his facts			0
@entity182 's move to the right has begun : we did n't learn anything new about @entity182 from his thursday speech			0
but it was how he presented himself that mattered -- and the @entity182 who showed up at @entity9 was a far cry from the @entity182 who ran for re-election in blue - leaning @entity183 last year , winning in resounding fashion			2
@entity182 gets warm reception from gathering of the right that @entity182 was all about bipartisan legislative compromise , @entity259 healing , and outreach to voters who do n't traditionally feel comfortable with the @entity31			2
his invitation to last year 's @entity9 was lost in the mail			2
this year 's @entity182 more resembled the @entity266 hero of 2009 , when he first won the governorship , and 2010 , when he traveled the country in rock star fashion campaigning for @entity31 candidates			2
@entity182 reminded the crowd of his opposition to abortion , calling himself " proudly pro-life			0
" he bashed unions and the media			0
he praised the @entity278 brothers			0
his speech should put to rest any doubts about his willingness to pivot to the right as he mounts a @entity31 presidential bid , even as he continues to be dogged by multiple controversies and investigations back home			0
@entity182 and his team took his @entity9 showing seriously			0
his top political advisers made the trip with him -- and they presumably left happy			0
@entity182 placed fourth in the @entity9 straw poll , a finish that beat expectations and made for a nice talking point as he begins the work of repairing his tarnished relationship with conservatives			1
what 's wrong with @entity9 ? the question popped up again and again in conversations with veteran conference - goers : what 's wrong with @entity9 this year ? the stakes at this year 's event felt low -- and so did the energy			1
there were , of course , the usual hordes of earnest , lanyard - wearing 20 - somethings brimming with youthful enthusiasm			0
but the main ballroom at the @entity313 in suburban @entity1 was rarely full			0
@entity9 ' @entity315 ' for young conservatives maybe it 's because the conference is at its most exciting during presidential campaign years , when @entity31 candidates are jostling for attention from the conservative base			1
@entity47 's comments draw fire from @entity231 , @entity233 or maybe it 's because the @entity266 activists who arrived here in 2009 and 2010 as conquering insurgents are now just the regular cast of characters and movement hangers - on who show up every year , hawking their wares , snapping pictures with conservative celebrities , recording their podcasts and delivering a familiar litany of warmed - over attacks on @entity103			1
whatever the reason , there were still plenty of journalists on hand to drink it all in			0
thanks to @entity9 's proximity to @entity348 , there always are			1
but the diplomatic standoff in @entity350 snuffed out the event 's usual ability to command the @entity354 news cycle			0
and when @entity120 tried to make hay of some of the wackier comments made by speakers , few reporters seemed to care			0
the headlines instead focused on the potential 2016 candidates who came here road - testing their messages			0
but aside from @entity42 , with his happy hour for young activists , the @entity33 wannabes were n't doing much behind - the - scenes to court activists			2
" this year is more subdued and does n't have the kind of vibrant atmosphere of past confabs -- a result of conservatives being lost in the political wilderness for six years without a unifying conservative leader , " said @entity369 , a @entity31 activist and operative from @entity371 who helped @entity234 line up support for the @entity9 presidential straw polls in 2007 and 2008			1
" it does n't help that there is not a concerted effort by a likely presidential candidate , especially a dark horse who needs a boost in their profile among the foot soldiers who would be critical to carrying their candidacy in a primary that will be fully under way a year from now , " he added .			0

confluence of big - name @entity31 speakers makes @entity9 impossible to ignore
@entity42 's straw poll win raises profile and expectations
even as @entity135 is scrutinized as 2016 contender , @entity103 still @entity9 's top bogeyman
