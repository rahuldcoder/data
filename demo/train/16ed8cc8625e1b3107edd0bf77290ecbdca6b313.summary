-- @entity2 workers are in the final stages of going door - to - door to complete the 2010 @entity6 census , but some experts are looking further to the future to explore the way @entity6 work , live and identify themselves			1
in his new book " the @entity12 : @entity6 in 2050 , " @entity13 offers thoughts on what the census will reveal in the next 40 years , including how migration patterns , population dynamics and cultural diversity will come to shape the portrait of the @entity6 landscape			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity13 recently on what he says is a lot more change to come			1
here is an edited transcript : @entity0 : you claim that " the majority in the @entity6 becomes nonwhite by 2050			1
" the current census has stirred up much controversy in terms of race relations and how we as @entity6 choose to identify ourselves			1
how will the nation 's ethnic makeup differ in relation to today ? @entity13 : there 's going to be a very diverse minority population with large amounts of interracial marriage			1
what we 'll see is that the @entity44 population will no longer be the majority			2
i believe the mixed - race population will grow the fastest because compared to the past , interracial relationships are increasingly tolerated and considered ok by a large percent of the younger generations			0
it 's no longer strange to see a black and white couple at a restaurant together today			2
yet someone visiting from the 1960s would be shocked			0
@entity0 : will negative factors like discrimination because of race be eliminated in the future ? @entity13 : i think the racial issue will always be there			1
race wo n't disappear , but it wo n't be the marker it was at one time			0
i think that people have a different attitude now			0
you do n't see the kind of concern for racial classifications that we once had			0
[ president ] @entity74 's election was a major turning point in @entity6 in defining that			1
i believe the current attitude will have a cascading effect of all varieties			0
@entity0 : how do you believe @entity6 will identify themselves in 2050 ? by categories of race or just as @entity6 ? @entity13 : i 'm almost sure that these categories of racial or ethnic identification will still be as important as they are now			1
historically , people were defined in a binary matter by race			0
but now more than ever , ethnicity is intertwined with identity and shapes the way people grow , what they believe and their perspectives on a variety of topics			0
now , a gay person is the same no matter what race			0
thus , these cultural and ethnic backgrounds will be key markers in terms of identity for @entity6			1
@entity0 : in your book , you describe how the nation 's population will grow to be nearly 400 million people in the next 40 years			1
how exactly will this happen ? @entity13 : the fact is that there will be more people in the future because of longevity			1
people are going to start living longer , immigration will be more feasible in the future , and the @entity6 will have a slightly higher fertility rate than other countries			1
this will mean more people to count in terms of the census and perhaps considering alternative ways to get that work done			0
@entity0 : your book also describes the idea of @entity6 becoming more energy efficient			2
that 's hard to believe with all the current energy and environmental issues affecting our nation today			1
@entity13 : we are going to have to deal with the energy issue -- i think people just need to be able to see a clear solution that makes some sort of sense			2
just look at how far we 've come			0
we 've invested billions of new transit systems all over the country , and that 's more since 1980			2
by 2050 , most people between the ages of 30 and 70 are going to want to live in single - family homes and [ drive ] more energy - efficient cars			0
@entity0 : will people be traveling less ? is that how we will contribute to bettering our energy situation ? @entity13 : yes			2
a lot more people will be working at home or closer to home			0
this is why suburbs will become the new centers of movement and grounds for change			2
this is the only real way to deal with it -- trying to tell people that they have to give up their houses , backyards , cars , and live like their grandparents is not a winning solution			0
especially when the people pushing for this method , like @entity170 and prince @entity171 , live infinitely larger than they could ever imagine living			0
@entity0 : so cities will become obsolete ? they will no longer be the hub of our planets ? @entity13 : well , if you look at the current status now , 90 percent of jobs are outside of the central core of cities			1
they wo n't be completely obsolete -- by 2050 , cities will still play a symbolic role in terms of culture , amenities and sports , but they will no longer be one of the dominant places where people live and work			0
@entity0 : you also describe how the @entity6 will become more economically competitive in the future			2
how do you -- this to @entity6 who have seen our current economy slide downward into a recession and are n't convinced about this prediction ? @entity13 : the @entity6 has relatively younger demographics , which gives it a competitive advantage			1
this nation attracts people from all over the world , and that 's what gives it global advantage ; we have the potential to be energy sufficient			2
we are the only advanced country with a growing population , agricultural surplus , lots of raw materials , significant domestic energy			0
the nation is entrepreneurial in culture and has a reasonably stable political system			0
that does n't mean that the @entity6 will be a hegemonic global power , but i believe the economic condition , due to these factors , will definitely improve in the future and the census will reflect that			1
@entity0 : your claims show a positive outcome for the nation amidst all the current issues in the world : war , political instability , the oil spill , lack of resources , unemployment , global warming			1
what should @entity6 consider in terms of making these changes happen by 2050 ? @entity13 : the @entity6 has many great advantages going into the next 40 years -- if we do what we need to do			1
there are serious problems we need to attack in terms of upward mobility and economic growth			0
if we do n't do that and we have a growing population , it will get difficult -- things will get worse and downwardly mobile for the nation .			0
