-- as @entity2 struggle to recover from the devastation of tuesday 's 7.0 - magnitude earthquake , mental health experts caution that the most severe psychological effects wo n't take form until individuals ' situations stabilize			1
feelings of confusion , fear , agitation , grief and anger that surround a large - scale traumatic event such as the @entity2 earthquake give way to more pronounced psychological disorders once people 's basic human needs are taken care of , experts say			1
" once the initial resources are in , when actually most people are going to start feel out of danger , is when the psychological aftereffects are going to hit people , " said dr. @entity23 , professor of clinical psychiatry at the @entity25 's @entity24			1
" people need to ask for help when that happens			2
" in the immediate short - term period after a large - scale traumatic event , people are concerned primarily with self - preservation and taking care of family and friends , said dr. @entity41 , chair of the @entity42 at @entity44 's @entity43			2
these people experience acute stress and anxiety , which is taken up by trying to fulfill the immediate physical needs			2
there is a normal and immediate stress response that comes with an event that causes damage to homes and infrastructure and loss of family members , @entity49 said			0
@entity2 has the potential for higher rates of mental illness and a slower recovery after this episode because the population is already strained from weak social and economic supports , @entity41 said			1
in those conditions , they may already be predisposed to developing mental illness irrespective of the earthquake itself , he said			2
view or add to @entity0 's database of missing persons in @entity2 the stress of the disaster situation , combined with the potential predisposition toward stress disorders , could lead to an extreme emotional reaction , but that does not mean these factors predict any kind of violent or other extreme behavior , said @entity80 , assistant professor of psychiatry at @entity82 , in an e-mail			1
" i 'd say that if the rate of psychological problems turns out similar to previous severe natural disasters in other economically disadvantaged countries , as many as 50 percent or more could suffer in the short - term from clinically significant distress , " she said			0
when disaster victims have information about their situation , they tend to make rational decisions and tend to the immediate needs of themselves and those close to them , @entity41 said			1
there is little evidence of widespread panic in those cases , he said , but there is a danger of misinformation			0
" people can accept uncertainty , as long as they are brought into the uncertainty and told what central authorities do know , and also what central authorities do n't know , " he said			0
" it 's critically important that there is information that comes out centrally from a single source			0
" to assist at the early stage , the most important thing to do immediately after a disaster -- for example , at this moment in @entity2 -- is to try to help with basic needs such as shelter and food , @entity49 said			1
in terms of psychological support , studies of natural disasters show that people should be moved to safety and informed that the immediate danger is over , something that has unfortunately been difficult to do in @entity2 , she said			1
about a month after a disaster occurs , once the immediate physical needs are addressed , symptoms of mental illness begin to coalesce into specific conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression , @entity41 said			0
ptsd in particular can last years after the event in a substantial portion of people , he said			1
some people may become fearful and develop panic attacks , while others experience sadness that turns into depression , and still others have an acute stress reaction that leads to ptsd or another stress disorder , @entity49 said			0
the high rates of mental illness in a population that has experienced a traumatic event go down over time , depending on how various problems in the area are resolved , @entity41 said			2
" the extent to which we are able to assist people in rebuilding their lives becomes a tremendously important driver of whether or not the psychopathology that is caused by the trauma will go on to become severe , and how long it lasts , " @entity41 said			0
in the aftermath of @entity169 in 2005 , researchers found that stressors such as not having a job , not having access to insurance and not being able to get paid contributed to the symptoms of mental illness , @entity41 said			0
" rebuilding lives , rebuilding social supports , rebuilding financial and practical supports will go a long way to minimizing the health consequences of the event that has passed , " he said			2
@entity181 : how will @entity2 cope with psychological aftershocks ? a population that has gone through something like an earthquake of this magnitude will typically have about 10 percent of people with ptsd and 10 percent with depression , based on studies of @entity169 , 9/11 , and other events , he said			1
but among those who lose their homes and loved ones in an event like this , the rates can be more like 40 to 50 percent			0
the life expectancy in @entity2 is just 61 years , according to the @entity200 , well under the average life span of 78 years for an individual in the @entity203			1
about 56 percent of @entity2 live on less than $ 1 per day , according to the @entity200			1
there is some research to suggest that fatalism -- feeling that you are powerless against life 's external control -- is also related to long - term emotional consequences of disaster , @entity80 said			0
studies by psychologist @entity213 at @entity214 have shown that adult disaster survivors who feel uncared for by others or who lack the capacity to manage stress are also at risk for @entity189 , @entity80 said			0
recent events such as @entity169 have offered extraordinary insights into human response to natural disasters , experts said			0
retired army lt. gen. @entity226 , who led relief efforts for @entity169 , said thursday that a lack of information " created a lot of anxiety for people because they did n't know what was going on			0
" " we need to correct that , and as soon as we can , start pushing information to people , because rumors can cause the victims to make bad decisions , " he said .			1

after initial shock of tragedy wanes , other mental issues arise , experts say
@entity200 : life expectancy in @entity2 is 61 years ; @entity203 is 78
expert : the @entity2 population is already strained from weak social and economic supports
there is a danger of rumors spreading , leading people to make bad decisions
