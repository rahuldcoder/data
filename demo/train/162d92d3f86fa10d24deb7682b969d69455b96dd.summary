-- on tuesday , @entity1 launched @entity2 , a streaming movie and tv service that features more than 5,000 titles			1
the long - rumored service is offered for no additional cost to members of @entity9 , the company 's loyalty program , which gives customers all - you - can - eat free two - day shipping for a $ 79 annual fee , and already boasts millions of members			2
at $ 79 a year -- or $ 6.58 per month -- @entity1 's new service is less expensive than subscriptions for @entity19 and @entity20 , which cost $ 7.99			1
will @entity1 's service have a big impact on the latter companies ? to some degree , @entity1 is now a competitor to @entity20 and @entity19 , but the competition is indirect			1
@entity20 and @entity19 more recently have focused on delivering fresher content to customers			1
@entity29 is more or less centered on longer - tail content			0
@entity0 : more about @entity1 " it 's a mix -- movies from @entity34 and @entity35 tend to be a little older , five to seven years , but we 've got some more recent movies , " says @entity31 , director of @entity29			1
" you are not going to find day - and - date movies			0
you 're not going to find brand - new movies in here because the movies are generally older			0
" the same goes for television			0
" we do n't have day - after - broadcast tv in our prime offering , " @entity31 says			2
what 's more , in addition to offering newer content , @entity19 also offers a much larger library , with an estimated 20,000 titles available for streaming , quadruple @entity1 's offerings			1
in a letter to customers featured prominently on @entity1 today , @entity1 ceo @entity55 touted the new offerings , from @entity59 to the @entity60			2
of the 18 titles bezos listed , 16 of them are also available for instant streaming on @entity19			1
@entity2 appears to be aimed less at @entity19 and @entity20 , and more at attracting new customers to @entity9			1
when users search for a movie title online now , they 'll will be peppered with benefits of the program			0
searching for " @entity70 , " for example , non-members will see that they can buy the dvd for $ 15 , not including shipping fees , or rent or buy the film via streaming for $ 3.99 or $ 11.99 , respectively			0
however , if they become members of @entity9 -- for only $ 6.58 a month -- they wo n't have to spend a penny on the film , since it 's available on @entity2			1
( and if they still want the dvd , there 's always free shipping			0
) those ramped up benefits might be enough to pull @entity1 users over to @entity9			0
but will it be enough to sway users into canceling their @entity90 and @entity20 subscriptions ? it 's too early to say			2
as @entity31 says , " we 're just getting started			0
