" @entity45 , blah , blah , " @entity12 said of the accusations			2
" we have nothing to hide and we are not afraid of nobody , nothing , " he said , adding that the judge asked @entity9 when he was planning to leave			1
" if he wants to live in this country , that 's his right , " @entity12 said			2

" @entity84 , a spokesman for the @entity77 @entity85 , said a range of human rights abuses and corruption issues surround @entity9			1
it 's still unclear why @entity9 decided to go back to @entity1 but his presence certainly added to a bubbling cauldron of political turmoil sparked by a presidential election mired in controversy			2

" preliminary results of the november 28 election placed former first lady @entity112 in a runoff with @entity114 , the candidate backed by @entity1 's unpopular president @entity115			0
however , international monitors charged fraud and a subsequent election review put @entity114 in third place			0
observers suggested he be eliminated from contention			0
@entity115 's government has not officially commented on @entity9 's return , though some @entity1 , craving a father figure to lead the nation out of crisis , have commented favorably on the days of @entity127			1

@entity128 said he hopes justice will finally prevail			0
