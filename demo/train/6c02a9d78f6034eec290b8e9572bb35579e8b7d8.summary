@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 members representing @entity6 cabin crews said monday they have voted overwhelmingly to strike , though no date was announced			1
the industrial action by the @entity10 union is over the airline 's plans to change cabin crew conditions			1
@entity10 said then that working hours were to be extended and crew levels cut , changes that it said would damage customer service and hit the @entity6 brand			1
in all , 81 percent of the nearly 80 percent of @entity10 workers who turned out voted in favor of the plan , the union said monday			1
a @entity10 representative told reporters the vote was an " indication of deep sense of grievance that our members feel " and shows that the airline must resolve this " through negotiation and not through litigation and certainly not through intimidation			1
" shop stewards are to meet tuesday to consider a strike date			0
@entity6 said in a posting on its web site that it regretted the strike announcement			2
" the outcome of the ballot is very disappointing and brings a renewed threat of industrial action , which is completely unjustified , " the airline said			2
" in the weeks before and during the ballot period , @entity10 claimed that we had breached individual crew members ' contracts by making modest changes to onboard crew numbers on flights from @entity52			2
we have always said this claim was false , and it was rejected by the @entity54 three days ago			0
" the vast majority of crew who voted in this ballot will have done so before the @entity54 decision			0
we hope @entity10 will bear this fact in mind as it considers its next steps			0
" the airline said it believed it had made progress in recent talks and said it wanted to resolve the issues			0
" however , we will not allow @entity10 to ruin this company , " it added			0
" should a strike take place , we will do everything we can to protect your travel plans as far as possible			0
" last december , a judge blocked a planned 12 - day strike by @entity10 that was to have begun just before @entity76			2
the airline , which lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year , has said the changes would save the carrier $ 665 million .			1
