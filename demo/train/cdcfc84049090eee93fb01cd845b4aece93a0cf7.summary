@entity0 , @entity1 -- ten years ago , a towering wall of water engulfed cities across the @entity6 , ravaging communities as far afield as @entity8 , @entity1 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
the 2004 tsunami was sparked by a massive , 9.1 magnitude earthquake which struck off the western coast of northern @entity14 , @entity1 , on @entity15			1
@entity0 , @entity1 , located at the northern tip of @entity14 , bore the brunt of the tsunami , with an estimated 130,700 killed , 565,384 internally displaced while 199,766 houses were destroyed or damaged			1
@entity20 , a children 's rights organization was one of the first organizations to provide humanitarian aid to the city			1
@entity25 , in @entity0 , was reduced to a crumbled shell after the four - meter - high wave roared inland			1
how did school principal , @entity28 , struggling to cope with the loss of two daughters -- and nearly half his students - find the strength to rebuild a devastated school ? reliving the tsunami it was early sunday morning , when the now 54 - year - old school principal was making breakfast for his wife and three daughters			1
the ground started to shake beneath their feet , and they realized that it was n't like any other earthquake			2
panicked , they ran -- @entity28 with his four - year - old daughter cradled in his arms , while his two other daughters followed hand in hand			2
ten years later , @entity28 still remembers the moment he watched the wave pull his youngest daughter under , right before his eyes			2
" in that instant , it was as though my breath escaped me , " says @entity28 , tears trickling down his face			0
he eventually stumbled across his wife , and news came that his eldest daughter was safe			0
for the next four days , he continued to wade through the devastation in search for his two younger daughters			0
" all i could see were dead bodies , swollen like balloons			0
i left it in the hands of god and i released my two daughters to him , " says @entity28			0
" up until today , i have been unable to find the bodies of my two daughters , " he says			0
" my wife is still traumatized and she refuses to go back to our old house , so now we stay in a house that was given to us by an @entity78			0
" moving on the past ten years have been difficult for @entity28 and his family			0
there were many days after the tsunami that he spent just feeling numb			1
while he was grieving for the loss of his two daughters , he had to return to the devastated school , where he had been principal since 1999			1
a temporary school was erected in the immediate aftermath , he and his students then began to work with @entity20 to design their dream school			1
@entity89 , child protection and participation program adviser for @entity20 in @entity1 , was posted as chief of mission for the child rights organization 's emergency response at the time			1
" when i arrived in @entity98 , they told me this empty area used to be a school and that the local community wanted @entity20 to rebuild this school < " he said			1
" as a child rights organisation , we wanted to do everything we could to ensure children were able to return to school and to support @entity28			1
" " they wanted their school to be resilient and earthquake - proof , and we tried to incorporate their ideas as much as we could , " he said			1
in may 2005 , six months after the tsunami , their new school was opened			1
returning to school " we used to have 207 students here at @entity98 -- when we reopened there were just 115 , " says @entity28			1
instead of diving back into lessons and homework , the school was a place where teachers and students could go to for counseling and support			1
" i encouraged the teachers to be spirited			0
i told them it was n't necessary to go straight back to the curriculum and that it was ok to read fun stories to them			0
it took time , but we all slowly got back to normal , " he says			0
@entity132 , an 18 - year - old former student at the school , lived in the hills for five months after the tsunami			1
she was grateful to return once it was rebuilt			2
" i was so happy			0
to me , school is very important , because without education we do not know anything , " she said			2
life today today , the brightly painted @entity25 is rich with laughter and activity			0
young school children are also taught about the dangers of disasters and regularly participate in evacuation drills			1
@entity148 was just two years old when the tsunami tore his village apart			2
" i lost my sister , " he says			0
" she was only three			0
my grandmother was carrying her to safety , but both of them fell and she was unable to keep hold of her			0
" now 12 , he lives with his mother and father and is a keen student at @entity25			0
he also knows what to do if an earthquake or tsunami strikes again			2
" at school , we are taught about where to evacuate if a disaster strikes and how we can help one another			2
we have also been taught to hide under a table if an earthquake strikes			0
i feel better prepared because of these classes and i can also tell my friends what to do , " he says			0
the tsunami still haunts him though -- as well as others			2
" i am ready , but i can not imagine another tsunami , as i still feel scared when i think about it , " says @entity148			2
as for @entity28 , he is proud of the way his school has been rebuilt			1
he is also flush with pride when he talks about his eldest daughter			0
now 25 , she is a mother to a little boy and has recently graduated with a masters degree			0
while the scars are still there to see , @entity28 , his family and his students , have rebuilt their lives as best they can			2
the children of @entity0 have been given the opportunity to return to a school , designed by them , just for them , so they too can achieve their hopes and dreams .			1
