@entity0 -- until last year , @entity2 was widely regarded as heir - apparent to his father @entity3 's global @entity5 media empire -- a remarkable turnaround for a college dropout once viewed as the family 's black sheep			1
but that aspiration took a hit following revelations that -- while he was boss of @entity15 and @entity16 -- the group 's @entity18 sunday tabloid the @entity13 eavesdropped illegally on politicians , celebrities , army veterans and even a teenaged murder victim in search of stories			0
the scandal has exposed collusion between journalists , media groups , politicians and police , claiming the jobs of top police officers , newspaper executives and prime minister @entity35 's spokesman , while dozens of people have been arrested			0
despite his insistence , in his testimony to the @entity39 inquiry investigating the matter , that he knew little of the scale of the hacking by @entity13 employees , @entity2 has also paid a price professionally			1
in february he resigned as executive chairman of the @entity18 newspaper division ; in april he stepped down as chairman of @entity5 's @entity18 - based broadcasting arm @entity49 , and subsequently relocated to the @entity50			0
@entity2 , 39 , said he was resigning to try to shield the satellite broadcaster from fallout from the newspaper scandal			1
" i believe that my resignation will help to ensure that there is no false conflation with events at a separate organization , " he said yet despite his corporate leadership having been heavily criticized by @entity18 media regulator @entity60 -- which found his actions in relation to the hacking scandal " repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of him as a chief executive officer and chairman " -- @entity2 may have suffered only a momentary career setback			1
in september , @entity18 media reported that he was set to take over the running of @entity71 , prompting angry responses from @entity5 shareholders			0
one shareholder quoted in a @entity18 newspaper called the news a " slap in the face for shareholders , not to mention victims of the hacking scandal			0
" as its deputy chief operating officer and head of international operations , @entity2 was the third most senior figure at @entity5 , wielding considerable influence through the stable of newspaper titles at his command			1
@entity2 finally succumbed to the turmoil that for a time threatened to engulf the entire company , even after it stepped away from a controversial bid to acquire full control of its @entity18 - based broadcasting arm , ending any possibility of him succeeding his father at the helm of one of the most powerful media empires in the world			1
@entity2 's close links to the papers at the heart of the phone - hacking scandal were pivotal			1
it was he who announced the closure of the @entity13 amid public fury about the paper 's tactics			0
he always denied being aware of the phone - hacking activities -- although he did authorize payments to appease victims			1
in evidence to a @entity18 parliamentary hearing in july 2011 , @entity2 said he could not recall seeing a key document known as the " for @entity119 " e-mail			1
it implied that the practice was being conducted by more than one journalist , but this statement was directly contradicted by two of the company 's senior employees and may be the focus of fresh questioning			0
days after his appearance , @entity35 said @entity2 had " questions to answer in parliament " over his evidence			1
it was another intriguing chapter in a varied career to date			0
the third child from his father 's second marriage , @entity2 once appeared to be the least likely of the media tycoon 's offspring to succeed , despite his evident intelligence			1
born in @entity0 , but raised in @entity141 , he attended @entity142 , where he studied film and animation before dropping out in the mid- 1990s to help launch a hip - hop music label , @entity146			1
it was n't long before @entity2 was brought into the family business			1
@entity146 was eventually bought by @entity5 and in 1996 @entity2 was persuaded to take over the company 's nascent internet operations , with mixed results			2
by 2000 @entity2 was in charge of @entity5 's @entity16 satellite business , @entity154 , where he appeared to find his feet			2
in 2003 he took over its @entity18 - based sister operation , @entity49 , quickly dispelling doubts about his business acumen by meeting ambitious profit targets			0
@entity2 continued to rise through the ranks , taking on his @entity5 executive roles in 2007			2
at the time , @entity162 described his son as a " talented and proven executive with a rare blend of international perspective and deep hands - on experience			1
" his new position handed him overall control of @entity171 , an umbrella company that includes the @entity173 newspaper , the @entity174 and the defunct @entity13 -- the paper whose activities triggered the current @entity18 media crisis			0
although regularly cited as one of the most influential figures in @entity18 , @entity2 's political allegiances have never been clear			2
a 2007 profile in the @entity182 newspaper said @entity2 was " unimpressed " by then opposition leader @entity35			2
@entity183 , meanwhile , described him as a " close confidant " of @entity35			0
@entity2 himself told the @entity174 in 2007 : " i do n't comment on politics			2
" @entity2 , who has two children with wife @entity188 , is said to be a black belt in karate			2
he is also proficient at corporate combat			0
in 2006 he steered @entity49 into the acquisition of a 17.9 % stake in @entity18 broadcaster @entity194 , blocking a rival move by @entity197			0
but it was his and @entity5 's plans to acquire full ownership of @entity49 that put them on a collision course with @entity18 lawmakers in the wake of the phone hacking scandal , with the company eventually deciding to back down under government pressure .			0
