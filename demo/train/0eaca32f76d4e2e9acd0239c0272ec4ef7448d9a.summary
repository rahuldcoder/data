@entity0 -- a former @entity4 station chief in @entity5 is under investigation by the @entity8 and justice departments after being accused of raping at least two women while he held the post , a source confirmed to @entity1 on wednesday			1
two @entity5 women allege that the @entity4 's former @entity5 station chief raped them at his home , a source says			1
the women told investigators that they think date - rape drugs were used in the assaults , which are said to have occurred at the officer 's official residence , according to the source			1
the story was first reported by @entity23			0
the allegations were made in the fall , when the unidentified officer was still serving as station chief			1
in october , soon after the allegations were made , the man returned to the @entity31 for a previously scheduled trip and was ordered not to return to his post , the source said			2
a senior @entity31 official confirmed that the case is under investigation but refused to comment on the details			0
@entity39 spokesman @entity38 issued a brief statement in response to a @entity1 inquiry , saying that " the individual in question has returned to @entity0 and the @entity31 government is looking into the matter , " and referring reporters to the @entity48			0
the women , who are @entity5 citizens , brought their allegations to a @entity31 government official , and federal authorities then launched an investigation			1
a search of the station chief 's residence in @entity5 was approved by a @entity31 district court judge after a request from the @entity48			1
the search found pills believed to be of a type commonly used in date rape , the source said			1
in that search , authorities also found about a dozen tapes that are thought to show the officer engaged in sexual acts , the source said , including some in which women are believed to be in a semiconscious state			1
@entity1 's source had not seen the tapes but had been briefed on their content			2
some of the tapes include date stamps indicating that the recordings happened when he would have been serving in @entity76 , @entity77 , before his tenure in @entity5			1
the investigation includes his time in both posts as well as other locations where he traveled			0
the identity of the officer could not be learned , and @entity1 was unable to reach a representative of the officer			0
it is against the law to reveal identities of covert officers			0
when the allegations surfaced in the fall , they were viewed as " tremendously explosive , no doubt about that , " the source said , especially because @entity5 is a @entity96 country			2
the @entity48 and the @entity4 would not comment on the allegations or any investigation			2
" i can assure you that the agency would take seriously and follow up any allegations of impropriety , " @entity4 spokesman @entity101 said			2
the officer has not been charged , the source said			0
the source would not speak for attribution because the investigation is ongoing and the source was not authorized to speak publicly			0
one federal law enforcement source said that no developments or activities relating to the case are " imminent			0
" a station chief heads the @entity4 's office in a foreign country , establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities in the country			1
