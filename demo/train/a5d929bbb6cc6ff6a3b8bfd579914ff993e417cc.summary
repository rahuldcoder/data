the @entity0 of @entity1 has filed what it is calling a " first - of - its - kind " lawsuit against the state , its @entity6 and one @entity8 - area school district for allegedly failing to teach students to read at grade level , as mandated by state law and its constitution			1
" what 's unique about this is that we 're focusing in on literacy and the right to read " @entity21 executive director @entity20 said of the complaint filed last week in state court			2
" literacy is the gateway to all other knowledge			0
" the suit names the @entity27 school district as a defendant , and it seeks to have the state and school district enforce a state law requiring that " a pupil who does not score satisfactorily on the 4th or 7th grade reading test shall be provided special assistance reasonably expected to enable the pupil to bring his or her reading skills to grade level within 12 months			1
" filed as a class action on behalf of eight students who , the @entity0 said , represent nearly 1,000 students in the district , the lawsuit cites individual cases of students struggling with basic literacy			1
one of the student plaintiffs reportedly failed the state 's standardized tests in his fourth , fifth and sixth grade years without receiving " any specialized reading intervention in 4th or 5th grade , " the lawsuit says			1
another student plaintiff has , according to the suit , attended @entity27 schools since first grade and after completing eighth grade earlier this year " his reading proficiency level is appropriate for the 2nd or 3rd grade			1
" @entity27 is one of the worst performing school districts in @entity1 , according to the state @entity6 , and its high school currently ranks in the bottom 1 % statewide			2
" no case ever filed anywhere in the @entity68 has addressed a school system in such dire straits			0
" said attorney @entity71 , a member of the @entity21 legal team			0
" the @entity74 is among the lowest achieving school districts in the nation , let alone @entity1 , " @entity71 added in an @entity0 news release			1
on january 27 , less than a month into his first term , @entity1 gov. @entity77 appointed the first of two emergency managers to take action in the @entity27 school district			0
though unable to comment directly on the suit , @entity83 , spokeswoman for @entity77 , said , " everything we have done and are doing is to ensure that the kids of @entity27 schools get the education they need and deserve			2
" a statement released monday by the @entity90 said : " the @entity90 has been counseled by our state attorney 's general office to not comment on pending litigation			0
" no one in the office of state attorney general @entity96 could be reached for comment			0
for @entity20 and the @entity0 , the situation and the lawsuit have national significance			1
" if kids are n't reading , nothing else is going to come , " @entity20 said			0
" if we 're not preparing our children , there is no way our economy can recover			0
