-- on sunday night " @entity3 " took the @entity1 for best picture			1
the film is must - watch cinema because it depicts the horrors of slavery through the eyes of a slave			1
@entity10 did all of humanity a favor when he wrote his book more than 150 years ago , and director @entity14 and producer @entity15 have earned our gratitude for turning his story into a transformative movie			0
through it , viewers confront the horror of slavery , see the tearing of raw flesh from whipping , the rapes , the complete lack of privacy that slaves experienced			2
we see depicted the system that was designed to destroy human beings ' free will during a shameful period of our nation 's history			2
that was then , this is now			0
the good news is that slavery was repealed by the 13th amendment and whites can no longer own blacks			2
the bad news is the troubling way that too many @entity44 talk about slavery in the 21st century -- or more accurately do not talk about slavery			1
which brings us to @entity48			1
the celebrity chef and tv host , whose food empire tumbled over , among other things , her use of a racial epithet , has found $ 75 million in backing from a private - equity company and is trying to make a comeback			1
she 's also opening a restaurant in @entity58 , @entity59			2
my first thought on hearing this was " thank @entity63 it 's not in my adopted city of @entity65 , @entity66			2
" but then i got very angry -- angry that i live in a country where someone who thinks like @entity48 can get a $ 75 - million vote of confidence			1
seriously ? ! i am not angry that in a deposition last year @entity48 admitted to using the @entity73 word			1
it is unfair to judge her based on only this , because no one is at his or her best during a deposition			0
no , i am angry because her views on race when she is in a more relaxed environment -- not under pressure , with plenty of time to think and choose her words -- are so wrongheaded that they require an apology			2
now i fear that she has $ 75 million reasons to never look back			0
@entity48 was interviewed by @entity93 reporter @entity92 in the fall of 2012			1
the interview was before a live audience and was recorded			2
@entity92 asked : " do you have a pride about the @entity99 that you can articulate and how do you place the racism and the slavery within that ? " @entity48 's response : " i do			1
my great grandfather was so devastated			0
he had lost his son , he had lost the war and he did n't know how to deal with life , with no one to help operate his plantation			0
there were 30 something people on his books and the next year 's census i go to find there 's like zero			2
between the death of his son and losing all the workers , he went out i 'm sure into the barn and he shot himself because he could n't deal with those kind of changes			0
and they were terrific changes			0
i feel like the @entity99 is almost less prejudiced because black folks played such an integral part in our lives			0
they were like our family			0
" let 's acknowledge that it 's sad when anyone takes his own life			0
but listen carefully to @entity48 's language			1
never once does she mention slavery			0
her great grandfather does n't own slaves -- he has " workers " or " people on his books			0
" he had no one to " help " operate his plantation			0
is that what we 're calling slave labor these days ? according to @entity48 , whites in the @entity99 treated their slaves like " family			1
" let 's travel back in time and ask , say , a man who might have been the @entity10 equivalent in her grandfather 's plantation			0
we do not know how @entity48 's forebears treated their slaves , but do you think a slave on that plantation would say he was treated like one of the family ? let 's not forget that if he did tell truth , he could be punished or even killed for doing so			1
only in @entity48 's altered universe could she think slaves were treated like family			1
she also tells us that @entity99 are less prejudiced because of those very circumstances			0
who knew that descendants of slave owners were less prejudiced ... because their relatives owned slaves ? what anyone who has seen " @entity3 " knows ( if they did n't know it before ) is that slavery was brutal and cruel			1
somehow @entity48 can not bring herself to even use the word , all the while taking credit for having slave owning relatives because that fact makes her and the rest of the @entity99 less prejudiced			1
listen to @entity48 's words during the @entity93 interview and you actually learn what her views on race are			1
for that she should apologize and lean in to the 21st century			0
until she does , she is not worthy of a second chance			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

@entity202 : " @entity3 " *offered* *harrowing* depiction of slavery 's horrors
she says it 's troubling the manner in which some , like @entity48 , still talk about slavery
the celebrity chef wants to make comeback . but listen to her words in @entity93 interview
@entity200 : @entity48 's words show *bizarre* *misreading* of slavery 's damage . she should apologize
