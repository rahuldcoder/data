-- one @entity2 , i bought my wife what she had wanted for years -- a weeping cherry tree -- and i threw in a bird bath , so that when the tree matures , our feathered friends can happily splash and drink under its loving protection			1
oh boy ! another tie or pair of funny boxer shorts for @entity14 ! for @entity16 , my wife gave me some boxer shorts and a tiny reading light , so i can flip through a book in bed without disturbing her			1
my wife is the first to admit it : for her , and for many people , @entity16 is an afterthought , a holiday just a few steps above the one that celebrates the groundhog and that other one that promotes trees			1
if @entity31 's @entity30 were in a prize fight , we all know which holiday would wind up lying in the corner of the ring , knocked - out teeth on the mat , dazed head stuck in a bucket			1
i 've been thinking about how our society recognizes parents because @entity16 is upon us again , but also because , a while ago , my worst nightmare happened : my wife had to have surgery			1
i was an emotional wreck			1
for a while , it was truly touch and go			2
life hung in the balance , and everything near and dear to me seemed in doubt			2
why ? because while @entity51 recovered from her toe surgery , i had to take care of the kids			2
parenting.com : work / family balance harder for men ? sure , for a couple workdays i was able to call in reinforcements ( my mom and mother - in - law ) , but an entire weekend lay ahead in which i was to be the prime caregiver to @entity64 , who was just hitting 6 months , and @entity67 , our 3 - year - old			1
meanwhile , my wife was upstairs in our bed , on painkillers and armed with her cell phone so that i was always just a speed dial away from doing her bidding			2
this would be a weekend in which i could n't do only the fun stuff -- like playing blocks and watching cartoons -- with the girls			2
i was obviously going to have to feed both of them ( three times a day ! ) , and i would have to tackle herculean tasks like giving baths , changing all of the diapers , putting them both to bed , and even giving medicine to @entity64 , who had an ear infection			2
over the decades , standards for fathers have risen			1
if this were 1897 or even 1974 , i could have coasted through the weekend , serving potato chips and cold cereal to @entity67 , and i would have brought the girls to my wife 's bed for her to do the changing of the diapers			2
i could have skipped the baths			2
i could have ignored the dishes in the sink and the cat litter without a barrage of criticism			0
as long as i managed to avoid the house catching on fire , and the girls did n't come down with malaria , at the end of the weekend , my family and friends would have laughed heartily at my mishaps , like they used to do in the last couple seconds of those 1970s and 1980s one - hour dramas ( you know , after somebody made a joke and the shot went into freeze frame )			1
then my family and friends would have declared that i had done my best , and nobody would have cared that the bar had been set so low that a chipmunk could have done as well			0
parenting.com : his way can be better than yours but today 's dads are different			0
we not only love our children , we 're acutely aware that we have a responsibility to be the best parents we can be			1
when it counts , i think most fathers really give it their all -- which explains why the saturday night of my mr. @entity31 weekend , instead of ordering pizza , i served @entity67 a chicken casserole with pineapple as a side dish			1
do n't applaud -- the fruit came from a can , and the rest from a box with four steps			0
ireport.com : share your best bonding moment with @entity14 still , i have to admit , i felt proud as the weekend wore on			0
i grew more confident in my parenting skills and even gave both girls a bath -- at the same time -- not once , but two nights in a row ! just as i was ready to nominate myself for a @entity153 , an @entity154 , a @entity155 -- surely i deserved some award -- i had an epiphany that brought me back down a few pegs			0
parenting.com : mommy skills that 'll work on husbands i was fixing a @entity163 dish i like to call poisson et pommes frites ( um , fish sticks and fries ) , when i caught @entity167 on @entity168			0
he was in @entity170 , surrounded by @entity172 soldiers , saying he was exhausted and scared			0
yet he warned the audience not to be too impressed with him			0
in a few days , he would fly home			0
the soldiers would remain at their posts			0
now , i 'm not comparing our girls to @entity180 insurgents , but i do appreciate more than ever that mothers are usually the soldiers in the parenting battlefield			0
even full - time working moms do more child - rearing than us dads , studies have repeatedly found			1
fathers tend to play the part of the dashing news reporter , swooping into parenting duties just long enough to get our hands dirty			1
my wife deserves her weeping cherry tree			0
and like most moms , she is worthy of much more			0
yet i think we dads merit at least a little more than boxer shorts , soap - on - a - rope , and neckties			1
we do n't get the good stuff because we 're paying for the sins of our fathers , and our fathers ' fathers			1
but these days , dads are changing diapers , warming bottles , and taking our kids to the park			0
we may not be where you want us yet , but we 've evolved , and we 're involved			1
just as much as the moms , we appreciate the cards , the praise , and being treated special on our day			0
so if any of you mothers now feel guilty enough to spring for a slightly nicer @entity16 gift -- say , a plasma tv with a 50 - inch screen -- make sure it also has built - in speakers with surround - sound			1

*writer* believes @entity16 is not as respected as @entity2
says : we 're paying for the sins of our fathers , and our fathers ' fathers
we deserve more than boxer shorts , soap - on - a - rope , and neckties
@entity242 with 50 - inch screen , built - in surround - sound speakers would be nice
