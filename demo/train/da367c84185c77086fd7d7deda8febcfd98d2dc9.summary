@entity0 -- makers of silicone breast implants have not followed up on thousands of women who received them as required by the @entity7 as a condition of approval , agency advisers said wednesday			1
@entity10 and @entity11 received @entity7 approval for their silicone gel - filled breast implants in 2006 after agreeing to do large , 10 - year post-market studies			1
but in a two - day meeting to update two @entity7 panels on the status of those trials , the companies admitted they had lost track of large numbers of women after implantation			1
@entity26 's study enrolled more than 40,000 patients but after three years had a follow - up rate of only 21 %			1
@entity11 enrolled more than 39,300 women with a follow - up rate of 60 % after two years			1
@entity31 , a spokesperson for @entity26 , said since launching the post-approval studies , the company has stressed the importance of follow - up to both the women participating and their doctors			1
he says it remains a challenge			0
" at @entity26 's request , letters from @entity7 were sent to physicians and patients to encourage follow - up and state the importance of follow - up ; unfortunately , there was minimal impact with respect to the follow - up rate , " @entity31 said			1
" we continue to encourage women to participate in these studies			2
" typically , it is not standard of care for breast implant patients to visit their plastic surgeon annually			2
patients most likely to follow up with their physician are those who experience complications			2
" during an open public comment session , some patients and patient advocates told of the horrors they 've encountered with silicone implants , in some cases imploring the manufacturers to make sure future studies are well - designed and protect women			1
@entity70 from @entity71 , @entity72 , replaced her saline implants with silicone six years ago and enrolled in @entity11 's study			1
she said her symptoms began within months			0
" i had difficulty raising my arms over my head , i had flu - like symptoms , neck and shoulder pain that resulted in physical therapy three times a week , " @entity77 said			2
" @entity87 vision , tingling , loss of appetite , insomnia , joint pain , anxiety , dizziness			0
every day seemed to bring new symptoms			0
" @entity95 of @entity96 had her implants for 28 years and says she had multiple symptoms			0
three years ago she was found to have connective tissue disease , chronic fatigue , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma and irritable bowel syndrome			0
an mri revealed 20 lesions on her brain and two collapsed implants with very little silicone left inside			0
" is the @entity7 willing to publicly state that silicone and platinum leaking into women 's bodies year after year is safe ? " she asked panelists			1
in contrast , @entity116 told the panel she would again get silicone implants after the birth of her second child			2
" after having two children i had lost all volume			2
i had no breast tissue			0
i have more self - confidence and am more proportional			2
" dr. @entity126 , with @entity128 's @entity127 and @entity129 , is a longtime champion of women 's health			0
the former director of policy and program development at the @entity135 @entity134 on women 's affairs said that unfortunately , time and time again , safety data have come up short			0
" for more than 20 years , @entity7 has been asking manufacturers to conduct and report rigorous studies on the safety and effectiveness of breast implants			1
this committee is now very aware of the limitations of the current post-approval studies			2
this leaves us in much the same place as in 2007 , or indeed as in 1992 , " @entity147 said			0
" @entity7 approved these products by two companies contingent on adequate post-approval studies			1
these studies do not seem to reach the bar			2
" @entity147 says real enforcement procedures need to be in place , including consideration of withdrawal of approval , requirements for sponsor - funded but independent research conducted for these studies , significant financial penalties , and major labeling or patient information changes			1
but @entity167 , professor and vice chairman of the @entity169 at the @entity170 , @entity171 at @entity172 and president of the @entity174 , says the implants are still safe and effective			0
he says there are a number of well - designed studies that document that claim			1
" i think both @entity174 as well as the @entity7 are confident that breast implants are safe and effective			1
we 're fortunate that we have a very high patient satisfaction rate -- above 90 %			0
ninety percent of breast implant patients are happy with their outcome and report an improved quality of life and body image			2
" @entity167 said the measures established five years ago by the @entity7 were very difficult because a study with 40,000 participants is very hard to track			1
" multi-investigators have a difficult time getting patients who are feeling well and back to their normal routine after surgery to come back in for their follow - up			1
" but @entity77 said she had a very different experience			0
" i was forced out of the study when i decided to remove the silicone implants to save my life , " she told the panel			2
" all of my records were deleted -- as if i never existed			0
" dr. @entity205 , a plastic surgeon from @entity172 , told the panel the implants were an " industrial toxin			0
" " the symptoms , they are real , " he said			0
" i answer five to seven e-mails a night from women all over the world asking			0
' what do i do about these symptoms ? ' " @entity205 said that by 10 years after patients get them , 50 % of silicone implants rupture ; 72 % by 15 years ; and 94 % rupture by 20 years			1
" why is the @entity7 continuing to allow a device to be placed in young women that is guaranteed to fail 80 % in 10 years ? would they allow that in hip replacements ? would they allow it in men ? " according to @entity174 , more then 318,000 breast augmentations were done in 2010 -- more than any other surgical procedure			1
sixty - two percent of those were silicone implants			0
both @entity26 and @entity11 's implants come with a warranty that offers free replacement in case of rupture or deflation			1
it offers surgical cost assistance for replacement surgery			0
another hotly debated topic was @entity242 screening			0
product labeling calls for patients to get an mri three years after implantation and then every two years after			0
@entity242 picks up about 90 % of ruptures , but the procedure is costly and some experts expressed concern over false positive readings			0
but the @entity7 says the mri is the gold standard for detecting silent rupture			1
the agency says it will continue to look into its clinical value			0
looking to the future , the agency said it will see the current studies completed , make sure follow - up rates improve and will look into the creation of a breast implant registry -- possibly on an international scale			1
@entity26 recommended a number of ways to get robust data on long - term safety , including enhanced post-market surveillance , and reviewing published literature and existing external databases like @entity270 -- a physician website managed by the @entity272			1
" we believe these sources may provide the data @entity7 requires on potential medical conditions in women with breast implants and would most likely capture any early ' safety signals , ' " @entity31 said			1
" this therefore reduces the need for another large epidemiological study			0
if any new safety signals are identified , we would work with the @entity7 to define a targeted study design			1
" @entity7 spokeswoman @entity284 said the agency has a lot to consider			1
" the past two days have provided some very compelling information for the @entity7			2
we took away several meaningful recommendations during the meeting			0
" @entity290 said the @entity7 's next step will be to review the recommendations and outline the suggestions they think should be implemented			2
they plan to engage stakeholders including sponsors , professional groups , patients , consumer groups and academia before making any decisions .			0

@entity26 , @entity11 admit they 've lost track of many patients
manufacturers had promised to do major 10 - year studies
panel hears from both doctors , patients that are highly concerned , quite *pleased*
@entity7 says it has much to consider
