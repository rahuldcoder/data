-- @entity1 may prove to be a golden ticket for @entity4 's congressional bid			1
nearly a decade ago , @entity5 were introduced to the adorable schoolteacher from @entity7			1
@entity4 wowed viewers and judges early in the second season auditions of " @entity11			1
" no one expected such an incredible voice to come out of such an unassuming package			2
he came out of nowhere and stole the show			2
his singing won him a golden ticket to @entity18 , but his resolve won him a unique place in the hearts of @entity5 viewers			0
and that could be just the training he needed for his next career			2
this week , @entity4 once again presented himself as an unassuming candidate , this time jumping into @entity7 politics as a @entity28 to challenge @entity5 rep. @entity29 , a @entity30 , for her 2nd @entity32 seat			1
as a former political appointee and reality tv show participant , i am intrigued by @entity4 's foray into the world of politics			1
he and i got our start on tv right around the same time			2
in all of my encounters with him over the last decade , i have found him to be kind , warm and authentic			0
i bet the voters in @entity7 will see the same thing			1
a friend asked me if i thought @entity4 's tv background would help or hurt him in his congressional race			1
@entity49 has uniquely prepared @entity4 for this adventure into politics			1
@entity4 has had to convince millions to vote for him -- first via a toll - free 866 number and soon in a voting booth			1
he has had to deflect the barbs of critics -- i 'm not sure who is worse , @entity58 or @entity57			0
and he has had to learn how to win over the media -- first in @entity18 , now inside the @entity60			0
back in 2003 and 2004 , reality tv was a lot different			1
@entity4 and @entity63 both were parts of instantly successful franchises at the peak of their popularity			1
each week , millions of viewers tuned in not only to watch but also to vote for their choices -- or vote off whom they did n't like			0
this created a new entertainment democracy			0
viewers were empowered to choose their favorites , and contestants had to campaign and compete for a spot on the show -- and for the hearts of @entity5 on an unofficial campaign trail			0
@entity1 requires you to have thick skin			1
when you have to face harsh critics such as @entity58 or @entity85 weekly , you have no choice but to be tough			0
but the toughest critic of all proved to be the @entity5 public			0
@entity4 was subjected to intense , relentless scrutiny			1
he was forced to learn and apply leadership principles that were essential to his longevity and success , on screen and off			0
and even when he got knocked down , he had to get back up and fight again			0
there are skills that we learned being on a reality show that may help @entity4 win			1
first , his message , which he has already tried and tested during his " @entity11 " days , will get refined in the political arena			0
he proudly shared @entity103 beliefs and his passion for young people with special needs , both traits that resonated with viewers -- and likely with @entity7 voters			1
secondly , his relationship with the media during " idol " taught him how to deal with them in a smart , shrewd yet upfront and sincere way			0
the press can spot a fake a mile away			0
on " @entity11 , " he quickly learned to forge relationships with the media to connect with those who would cast their votes each week			2
in his congressional race , he will likely be able to reach voters in ways that his competitor ca n't			0
because of his tv training , he already knows how to do so			2
lastly , his two previous losses -- he came in second place behind @entity128 during the second season of " idol " and placed second behind @entity131 in the fifth season of " @entity133 " -- could prove to be just the hook in his bid for @entity136			1
going up against an incumbent in a traditionally @entity30 district , voters will see @entity4 as the underdog and may rally behind him			2
voters may feel that his time has come			0
and everyone roots for the underdog			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			2

@entity4 *announced* he is running for @entity136 in @entity7 as a @entity28
