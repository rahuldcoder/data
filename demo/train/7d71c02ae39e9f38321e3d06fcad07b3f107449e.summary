@entity0 , @entity1 -- last week during the day , some kids in @entity5 , @entity6 , were playing soccer in a park when a car slowed down , guys got out and executed a 13 - year - old boy			1
and then they drove away , unmolested in a city with 11,000 army and police officers			1
the @entity6 government repeatedly states that 90 percent of the deaths in the current drug war are of people who are dirty ; that is , criminals involved in the drug business			1
the killings of reporters and of innocent women , men and children continually belie that statement			2
the child was not a cartel member in disguise			2
nor were the 15 high school kids killed at a party in a small house in a poor barrio			2
their parents had made them hold the celebration of a sports victory at home because it was too dangerous to be out in the city			2
i went to @entity5 in june of 1995 and never seem to escape the pull of the place			1
the city then was controlled by @entity43 , then the head of the @entity5 cartel			1
@entity47 intelligence told me he was raking in $ 250 million a week			0
@entity50 factories were erupting out of the ground in the wake of the passage of @entity54			1
huge districts of shacks made out of stolen pallets and cardboard boxes were growing faster than the city could map			0
these shacks were filled with people working full time in those @entity50 - owned factories			1
murders ran around 250 a year and sometimes the cartel left bodies on the street wrapped in yellow ribbon			0
@entity67 ran the city and yet his name never appeared in the newspapers nor was mentioned on radio and television			0
i thought i 'd stumbled into hell			0
now the city is dying			0
about 5,000 people have been slaughtered in @entity5 in 27 months			1
it is a destroyed city where 25 percent of the houses are abandoned and 40 percent of the businesses have closed			0
there were 2,600 murders last year and killings are going on at a faster clip this year			0
at night , no one is on the streets			0
i realize that i was a fool in 1995			0
i had not stumbled into hell			0
that was the golden age			0
but one constant remains : no matter how many die in @entity5 , no matter how low the pay in the @entity50 factories , the @entity50 government insists the @entity92 is being won and that @entity54 is a big success			1
the @entity94 is not lost : it never seriously began			0
the drug industry is an essential prop under a faltering @entity6 economy and has been so for more than 20 years , since the peso crisis of the early 1980s			1
the money flows into the hands of countless government officials , into the banking industry and into many investments in @entity6			1
more people die each day as the government of president @entity106 uses the @entity6 army and the federal police to try to get the illegal drug industry under control			1
@entity106 was elected by a razor - thin margin and followed the custom of @entity6 presidents by immediately making a show of force			1
but he badly underestimated the power of the drug industry			2
the profits are estimated by many analysts to be between $ 30 billion and $ 50 billion a year , although it 's notoriously difficult to track			2
but it is not a piddling sum in a country where oil is the official highest earner of foreign currency and supplies 40 percent of the federal budget			0
but the oil is running out			0
@entity106 has publicly stated that the oil fields will be gone in 10 years or less			0
the next big earner is human flesh , the millions of @entity6 who have fled the economic doom of their nation and send more than $ 20 billion a year home from the @entity50			1
but the recession and job losses in the @entity50 have cut into that source			1
tourism ranks third in legitimate sources of money for @entity6 , but in a nation where heads keep getting lopped off , tourism is n't thriving			1
the illegal drug industry in @entity6 employs hundreds of thousands of people			1
no one knows the payroll , but certainly it includes many people in the army , the 3,500 separate police forces and the government from top to bottom			2
it 's difficult to make a living wage legitimately here			2
the pay varies , but in @entity5 , one of the most violent cities on @entity161 , the starting salary in the 400 foreign - owned factories , mainly @entity50 , is about 40 bucks a week			1
there are 500 to 900 street gangs			0
no one can live on the pay offered by these factories			0
in a country with 50 percent of the population living in poverty , the turnover in these plants runs from 100 to 200 percent a year			0
no one can live long in a gang -- but for a while , a kid can live well and feel that his life is a dream of money and power			2
the @entity50 approach to the killings in @entity6 never looks at an economic reason , just as the consequences of our free trade treaty ( @entity54 ) are never brought up			1
the effects wrought by @entity54 launched one of the largest human migrations in the world as poor @entity6 fled collapsing industry and agriculture			1
@entity195 statistics show that the number of @entity6 entering the @entity50 illegally skyrocketed within two years of the passage of @entity54			1
we also never question our four - decades - old @entity92 , which has produced cheaper drugs of higher quality at lower prices in thousands of @entity50 cities and towns			1
it has helped create one of the largest prison populations in the world			0
if our drug policy were a ship , it would be called the @entity211			2
anyone who questions the propaganda of the @entity50 government on the violence in @entity6 , on our @entity92 or on our free trade agreement is told to come up with a solution , some silver bullet that instantly slays the dragon			1
but our policies over the decades have created a disaster , and it will take years to reverse the damage these acts of government have inflicted			0
the time to start is now			0
let 's address the true and lethal nature of @entity6 's war on drugs -- one we are in part bankrolling under the @entity232 to the tune of half a billion dollars per year , often tossed into the murderous hands of many in the @entity6 army			1
we need to have a public discussion of the obvious : legalize drugs or keep caging @entity50 for taking drugs -- unless of course they are booze , tobacco or happy pills from the doctor -- and keep financing the murders of @entity6			1
the first thing to do if we want to come clean about the slaughter in @entity6 is start smelling the coffee			2
we share a 1,900 - mile border			0
we share a history and people			0
at least 10 percent of the @entity6 people now live in the @entity50 as economic or political fugitives			1
recently , the secretaries of @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 flew to @entity256 and promised the @entity6 government we would continue exactly the same polices as in the past			2
i have been told i should be reasonable			0
and i expect the same of my government			0
building prisons and lending support to a murderous war on drugs must stop , and digging deep into the economics and politics behind the hellish state of affairs must begin			0
it 's a testament to the @entity6 people that no matter how hard life is in @entity5 , they seem to endure , raise families , smile and try to create a better future			1
as a @entity6 friend told me , " i love @entity5 , it is such a needy city			1
" it is poor and dangerous , a tapestry of one - story buildings			0
but once you know @entity5 it haunts you no matter how you try to flee			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity284 .			2

@entity284 : 5,000 killed in @entity5 in 27 months , one of most violent cities on @entity161
@entity284 : innocents die in *crossfire* among cartels , army , police
he says drug trade is a source of money for the @entity6 economy
@entity284 : @entity50 must face @entity54 's *failures* and the lethal results of " @entity92 "
