-- some people are wondering about the capability of the @entity3 after it was revealed that @entity5 , the fence jumper who breached @entity9 security two weeks ago , made it much farther into the house than previously reported , running through the first floor before he was apprehended outside the @entity12			1
the details of @entity5 's intrusion , coupled with a new report on tuesday that an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with the president on a recent trip to the @entity20 , plus a report that it took the @entity3 four days to learn that seven bullets had hit the @entity9 's residence area in 2011 and a string of other blunders in recent years ( such as a couple crashing a state dinner and a prostitution scandal in @entity29 ) , have put the @entity3 under a harsh light			1
the problems plaguing the @entity3 go beyond pr embarrassments , and changes seem inevitable			1
but despite the cries of reform , significant alterations to the way the agency functions will be difficult and ultimately may not even be known to the public			1
a change at the top @entity3 director @entity44 's future is uncertain			1
on tuesday , @entity9 press secretary @entity45 said president @entity46 has confidence in @entity48 , whom he appointed in 2013			1
but the fervor surrounding this incident does n't bode well for @entity48 , the agency 's first female director			2
" when you lie , and when you obfuscate and when you cover up , especially in the 21st century , that 's an offense you ca n't walk back from , " said @entity53 , director of the @entity54 at @entity55 and a @entity3 expert			2
" that 's really the kiss of death for any leader			0
" how much blame @entity48 actually deserves is entirely unknown , and the replacement of an agency head -- though often necessary because of optics -- is sometimes purely that : it does n't always bring about change			0
" it 's basically impossible that agencies are so entrenched and so enmeshed in their own long - term culture that any change in personnel at the top is merely about symbolism , " @entity53 said			0
" it 's unlikely in the short term to make any significant impact in how the agency operates			1
" @entity46 appointed @entity48 as @entity3 director after her predecessor , @entity81 , retired in early 2013			2
@entity81 's departure came in the wake of another scandal -- when several male agents on a presidential trip in @entity87 , @entity29 , took prostitutes back to their hotel rooms -- that rocked the agency nearly a year earlier			0
@entity3 beefs up presence after 2 @entity9 security incidents obstacles to change though its director is appointed directly by the president , the @entity3 is not its own government department			1
it has been a branch of the @entity97 since march 1 , 2003 , shortly after that department was established			2
previously , the @entity3 had been part of the @entity100 but was moved to streamline the various security measures around the president , the vice president and their families			1
" the entire purpose of moving their institutional affiliation after the reforms , after 9/11 , was in order to allow them to focus on their core mission : to protect the president , " @entity53 said			0
" this was supposed to streamline that and supposed to help with actual physical security issues			0
" change in large bureaucratic structure at agencies such as @entity97 ( or even @entity100 ) is typically difficult and moves very slowly			1
plus , the agency did not escape budget cuts in 2013			0
there may also be a cultural roadblock to potential reform			0
" @entity129 has the attitude of ' we make do with less ; we can take care of any problem , ' " said investigative journalist @entity123 , a critic of the @entity3 who wrote about some of the details in the 2011 @entity9 shooting in his book " @entity128			1
" the good news is that the @entity3 , which is highly selective , is much smaller than most government agencies , so change could be a bit easier			2
secrecy factor the @entity3 has two missions : protecting the president , the vice president and their respective families , plus past presidents and presidential candidates , and investigating crimes including identity theft , counterfeiting and computer fraud			2
the protection responsibility is the more recognized of the two and the task that received the majority of the agency 's nearly $ 1.6 billion budget in 2014 : $ 920 million of that total allotment went to protection costs			0
because of the nature of its mission , many of the agency 's protocols are secret			0
" they assiduously do n't want their protocols available for the public to discuss , " @entity53 said			0
even some changes in customs brought about by these incidents might not be publicly revealed			0
a strong record recent incidents aside , the @entity3 , which has been protecting @entity170 presidents since 1906 , still boasts a generally impressive record			2
hundreds of fence jumpers have been apprehended immediately , thousands of presidential trips have gone off without a hitch domestically and overseas , an untold number of threats have been neutralized , and there 's been an ability to keep up with ever - evolving technology that poses new dangers			0
@entity3 director calls @entity9 intrusion ' unacceptable '			1

significant changes to the @entity3 could be difficult to *implement*
the @entity3 operates as a part of the @entity97
the agency is facing harsh criticism after an *unprecedented* @entity9 breach
