-- the recent ordeal of @entity2 , a @entity3 mother and wife of an @entity6 citizen -- coupled with @entity8 's continued imprisonment of @entity9 , also an @entity6 citizen and a pastor -- should awaken our conscience to one grim and inescapable fact : the persecution of @entity16 continues			1
charged with leaving @entity17 to marry a @entity18 , despite being raised a @entity18 and remaining one throughout her 27 years , @entity2 was sentenced to death last month for apostasy			0
after an international outcry , she was released , rearrested , and released again , according to the @entity23			0
in @entity3 and @entity8 , as well as countries like @entity25 , leaders and movements impose their own extreme interpretations of @entity17 , while restricting the rights of @entity16 and other religious minorities			1
elsewhere in the @entity34 , mass violence as well as repression arises from such movements			1
in @entity39 and @entity40 , forces of the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) commit horrific abuses against @entity16 and others , from torture to murder			1
in @entity48 , scores of churches and other @entity18 structures were burned by radicals last autumn following president @entity51 's fall			2
while @entity16 faced repression under prior regimes like @entity54 's , their predicament has worsened in a @entity57 world			1
7 terrible countries for @entity16 with media attention riveted on the @entity34 , it is tempting to assume that persecution against @entity16 occurs almost exclusively in that region			1
but assaults against @entity16 are worldwide , transcending any one regional , ideological , or religious bent			1
combating this problem entails a much broader solution			0
according to the findings of the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , evidence abounds of persecution elsewhere			0
in @entity76 ( also known as @entity76 ) , with a @entity72 majority and a struggling democracy , ethnic - minority @entity16 , along with @entity75 , have faced ongoing abuses			1
last year , during military incursions in @entity80 , as many as 60 churches were shelled			0
military forces have beaten and arrested @entity18 leaders and kidnapped church members for forced labor			0
in @entity92 , the world 's most populous nation , @entity85 and @entity86 refusing to register with the communist dictatorship face arrests and fines , and their churches are shuttered			2
@entity92 's government has issued a directive to " eradicate " unregistered @entity86 churches over the next decade , and even registered churches have recently been bulldozed in @entity97 province			0
in @entity100 , a military regime jails up to 3,000 people , mostly evangelical or @entity16 , on religious grounds			1
prisoners have been beaten and tortured			0
in interviews with @entity69 , released prisoners reported being confined in 20 - foot metal shipping containers with extreme temperature fluctuations			0
in @entity108 , the world 's largest democracy , @entity16 face harassment and violence , especially in states with laws restricting religious conversion from @entity116			1
in @entity118 , the central government fails to protect @entity16 , as well as @entity75 , from @entity120 terrorism			1
in @entity127 , a totalitarian tyranny with a cult of personality venerating the ruling @entity126 family , the government imprisons , tortures , and executes @entity16 caught transporting bibles or engaging in missionary endeavors or other banned activities			2
@entity127 who flee for @entity92 and then convert to @entity18 are in grave danger when forcibly returned			0
punishment includes beatings , torture , forced labor , sexual violence , and forced abortions or infanticide			0
in @entity141 , @entity16 face a government that can imprison them unjustly under blasphemy laws while failing to protect them from attacks or punish their attackers			2
last september , suicide bombers launched the worst assault against @entity16 in @entity141 's history , leaving , according to conservative estimates , at least 80 dead and more than 150 other parishioners wounded at a @entity152 church			1
in @entity154 , a communist government suppresses independent protestants and other groups operating without government approval			0
the regime seeks to stop their growth through discrimination , violence , and forced renunciations of faith			0
opinion : extremism fuels abuse of @entity16 in @entity34 and in a host of post-soviet countries , @entity16 in unregistered churches are seriously constrained			1
in several of these countries , including @entity172 , individuals are in prison for belonging to such churches			0
abuses against @entity16 span the globe			2
a key reason is the confluence of two factors			0
first , there are more than 2 billion christians in the world			1
second , according to a @entity184 study , in one - third of all nations , containing 75 % of the world 's people , governments either perpetrate or tolerate serious religious freedom abuses			1
a six - year @entity184 study found that over six years , @entity16 were harassed in 151 countries , the largest of any group surveyed			2
in other words , given their enormous numbers and wide dispersion across nations , as well as the lack of freedom in many nations , it is no surprise how often @entity16 are persecuted			1
christians are often regarded as alien because some are members of ethnic minorities or are perceived as being identified with @entity208 interests			0
for despotic governments and religious extremists , @entity18 is a dangerous source of competing authority , challenging their claims of absolute supremacy			0
the bottom line is that @entity16 are the proverbial canary in the coal mine			2
wherever they are persecuted , the right to religious freedom for all is jeopardized			1
wherever they are harassed or jailed , detained or discriminated against , tortured or murdered , governments perpetrate or tolerate abuses against others as well			0
the global persecution of @entity16 remains a serious indictment against governments and cultures for failing to protect a bedrock human right -- one that is enshrined in the 1948 @entity231 , which was signed by nearly every nation , and subsequent covenants			2
we must continue to demand respect for that right , so that @entity3 mothers and others can follow the call of conscience and conduct their lives in peace .			2

@entity243 : @entity3 mother 's ordeal shows @entity16 still persecuted
@entity243 : it 's *wrong* to think discrimation against @entity16 just happens in the @entity34
@entity243 : assaults against @entity16 transcend regional , ideological , or religious bent
he says a third of 2 billion @entity16 live in nations that allow abuse of religious freedom
