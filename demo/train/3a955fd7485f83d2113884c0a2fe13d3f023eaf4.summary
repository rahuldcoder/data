-- @entity1 used to be a partner at a top @entity4 law firm , but he left four years ago to defend , for free , prisoners at the @entity7 military facility at @entity8 , @entity9			1
it seemed like a good idea at the time			2
the @entity7 @entity12 had just opened its door to @entity8 prisoners in @entity15 v. @entity16			1
the case recognized the prisoners ' right to challenge their detentions in court , even if they were n't @entity7 citizens and even though they were imprisoned abroad			1
at the time , the controversial detention center was frequently in headlines and talked about on the campaign trail			1
as one of his first acts in office , president @entity26 signed an executive order requiring that the @entity8 detention facility be closed within a year			1
three and a half years later , it 's still open , and it 's faded from the public eye			2
earlier this month , the @entity12 refused to take a fresh look at the habeas corpus petitions by the suspected foreign enemy fighters for the second year in a row			1
@entity12 declines fresh review of @entity8 detainee issue @entity8 prisoners still have the right to challenge their detentions , @entity1 said , but it 's more symbolic than real			1
in his opinion , the @entity12 has shut the door on @entity8			1
" i would n't say i 'm numb , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" but i am realistic			0
i tell my clients my pessimism has never failed me			0
i do n't want to give them hope unless there is hope			0
there 's less hope now than ever			0
" hear @entity0 's @entity51 talk to @entity1 on @entity52 about the court 's decision of the 169 people still detained , the government says 89 are n't a threat , but @entity26 and @entity58 have blocked their release			1
as for the rest , some of them have a shot at a military hearing , but 46 do n't have that chance because the government says they ca n't be tried for one reason or another but are too dangerous to be released			0
" so now , the executive is against transfers , @entity58 is against transfers and the courthouse doors are shut , " @entity1 says			1
" all three branches of the government are aligned against us			0
" if there was any @entity8 prisoner case that lawyers thought the @entity12 would take up , it was @entity79 's of @entity80			1
federal appeals court rules against @entity8 detainee the government says @entity79 went to @entity86 to fight for @entity87			1
@entity79 says he went to @entity86 and @entity88 to get medical treatment with the help of an @entity92 charity			0
he 's been at @entity8 for 10 years			1
" @entity79 is a very disturbed young man , " @entity1 says			2
" he has been in the psych ward			0
he 's been on suicide watch			0
he has eaten screws , urine cups , plastic bags			0
he would smear excrement all over his body			0
i once said to him : how can you stand the smell ? he said , ' that 's nothing compared to what i 'm feeling			0
' " over the years , @entity81 has gotten to know @entity79			0
he says he 's familiar with his mental problems , his apparent suicide attempts , his poetry			0
at one meeting he had with his client -- then in his seventh year as a prisoner -- @entity1 says @entity79 threw a cup of his blood on him			1
he 'd cut a vein in his wrist and let the blood flow into an empty cup under the table where they sat. the next time they met , @entity1 says , the prison guards had @entity79 in so many restraints that @entity1 had to call a federal judge for help when @entity79 wanted to use the bathroom			2
they had to litigate it over the phone			0
he said the judge " did n't want to second - guess the security aspect and he said , ' well , he 's got to be able to clean himself , ' " @entity1 said			2
about a year later , that same judge , @entity7 district judge @entity129 , reviewed the evidence against @entity79 in a petition for habeas corpus -- the right that was granted to @entity8 prisoners in the @entity15 case			1
@entity129 found the government 's evidence , based on an intelligence report by @entity7 agents , was n't reliable enough to keep @entity79 locked up			0
and he found @entity79 's story was plausible , so he ordered @entity79 's release in july 2010			0
but in a 2 - 1 vote , the appeals court that reviews all @entity8 habeas cases reversed that in october 2011			1
the appeals court said @entity129 should have automatically presumed the government 's intelligence report on @entity148 was reliable and rejected the case			2
@entity79 is still a prisoner at @entity8			2
federal appeals court rules against @entity8 detainee after the @entity12 turned down @entity79 's case on june 11 , @entity1 called @entity79 to tell him			1
he also called @entity79 's family in @entity80			0
@entity1 asked @entity79 's younger brother , @entity154 , whether he had any questions			2
@entity154 wanted to know why his brother had n't been released even though a federal judge said he should be			0
@entity1 said he explained what happened , and they talked a bit more			2
then , @entity1 said @entity154 thanked him " from the depth of my family 's heart for all you have done , " and hung up .			2
