@entity0 was working in his @entity3 office wednesday when a colleague told him two men were standing outside with " kalashnikovs			1
" they were trying to get into the building			1
moments later , the massacre erupted in the offices of satirical magazine @entity11 feet away from @entity12 , he told @entity1 's @entity13			1
" we heard the first shots and then more and more shots , right across the whole five or six minutes			1
" and they heard screams , said @entity0 , who is a documentarian			1
they ran for the roof , while their minds raced through possible dangers			1
" we knew that there were victims a few meters away from us , but there might be , you know , some explosives somewhere or maybe a third guy , " @entity0 said			1
separating men from women in the offices of @entity11 , the masked gunmen dressed in black apparently barged in on a conference			1
survivors later told their stories to a doctor who treated them			1
he relayed them to @entity1			1
the gunman separated the men from the women and called out names of cartoonists			2
not randomly spraying bullets , but taking professional , precise aim			2
they left the building , and cell phone video captured them as they ran in the street and kept firing			2
one of the masked men ran over to a man in uniform lying apparently wounded on the sidewalk and shot him at close range			1
the two said they were avenging the @entity60 and shouted " @entity61 , " which translates to " @entity64 is great , " a @entity63 official said			2
video shows a gunman approaching his black getaway car and raising his finger			2
perhaps it was a signal			2
a coveted target when the gunfire ceased , @entity0 and his colleagues went back into the building			1
they could n't have been too surprised that the satire magazine had been attacked			2
threats against it had been widely reported			2
@entity11 's previous offices had been fire - bombed three years before , the day it was to publish a provocative cover lampooning the @entity82 prophet @entity60			1
they moved to their current office a year ago , @entity83 , who works in the building , told @entity1 's @entity87			2
the magazine refused to change anything and kept publishing irreverent cartoons on @entity82 but also on @entity91 , @entity92 , politics and society -- in its usual profane style			2
@entity11 's editor , cartoonist @entity96 -- " @entity96 " for short -- was on an @entity98 target list			1
the gunmen killed him , as they did three other famous cartoonists , known by the pen names @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
@entity96 was constantly guarded , @entity106 journalist @entity105 told @entity1 's @entity107			0
" he was always accompanied by one or two secret service officers			0
everywhere we went , for the last four years			0
at day and at night , so he was protected , " he said			0
@entity111 thinks one of those killed was a body guard			0
bodies on the left in the meeting room , @entity0 saw bodies lying off to the left			0
survivors were either hiding or standing			0
" they were just standing like -- not zombies -- but they were standing and did n't do anything , " he said			0
" we tried to help the very first one , but actually , to be honest , there were not a lot of wounded , they were just people dead , all around			0
" but the gunman had not only killed in the meeting room			0
@entity83 made his way to @entity11 's offices as well			1
the first thing he saw was the body of a building doorman			0
" this grumpy guy we liked and appreciated			0
he was lying down in his blood , and he was dead ; he had been shot by the gunners			0
" blood stained the stairways , where heavily wounded people lay			0
a man @entity83 knew for 20 years had been shot in each leg			1
@entity83 went up to the cartoonists ' offices			1
" they were in one room , some crying hysterical			0
some were , like , prostrated and not capable of saying anything , saying a word , " @entity83 said			0
the gunmen had shot dead eight of their colleagues , as well as a guest , the doorman and two police officers			1
on thursday , businesses around the corner in the trendy inner city neighborhood reopened , cafes filled with patrons and traffic congested streets			0
aside from a covey of journalists ' satellite trucks the only sign of the carnage a day earlier was a tribute taped to a tree			0
a bouquet of roses and a quote by a @entity63 philosopher			0
it read , " there is only one step from fanaticism to barbarism			0
