-- more than 100 countries attending a conference in @entity4 , @entity1 formally adopted a treaty friday to ban cluster bombs -- a large , unreliable and inaccurate weapon that often affects civilians long after the end of armed conflict			1
@entity11 , a 44 - year - old @entity12 national , lost his leg to a cluster bomb			2
the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain , and they also agreed never to develop , acquire , retain or transfer cluster munitions , according to the official treaty document			1
the 111 countries attending the two - week meeting agreed to the treaty wednesday but formally signed it friday			1
the countries said they are " deeply concerned " about civilians suffering the long - term effects of cluster bombs			1
they are " concerned that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians , including women and children , obstruct economic and social development , including through the loss of livelihood , impede post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction , delay or prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons , can negatively impact on national and international peace - building and humanitarian assistance efforts , and have other severe consequences that can persist for many years after use , " the document said			2
in addition to calling for a total , immediate ban of the weapons , the international accord calls for strong standards to protect those injured by them and to make sure that contaminated areas are cleaned up as quickly as possible and that the weapons are immediately destroyed , a spokesman for the @entity46 told @entity0			0
some of the biggest makers and users of cluster bombs cited by human rights groups -- such the @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 -- were not involved in the talks and did not sign the accord			1
organizers expressed hope that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance			0
" even though we all know that there are important states not present , i am also convinced that together we will have succeeded in stigmatizing any future use of cluster munitions , " said @entity69 , @entity1 's minister for foreign affairs			0
@entity69 said he ultimately wants to see all @entity76 member states ratify the treaty			2
the agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years , said @entity82 , coordinator of the @entity46			0
cluster munitions , which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets , are what the @entity86 has called a " persistent humanitarian problem			0
" most of a cluster bomb 's bomblets are meant to explode on impact , but many do not			2
credible estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time , according to the @entity86			2
that means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area , often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians			2
earlier this month , a @entity104 representative called it " an absolute moral obligation " to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle			0
but acting assistant secretary for political - military affairs @entity110 said the @entity60 was attempting to solve the problem through a disarmament body called the @entity113 , or the @entity113 , which meets in @entity114 and comprises major military powers and military trade producers			0
the ccw is to meet next in july			0
the @entity60 would not agree to any ban because the country considers cluster munitions an important part of its defense strategy , @entity110 said			1
he urged regulation of the weapons to render them harmless after battle			0
during the 34 - day war in @entity12 in 2006 , the @entity76 estimated that @entity63 dropped 4 million bomblets , 1 million of which may not have exploded , according to the @entity86			1
more than 250 civilians and bomb - disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern @entity12 since the war ended			1
cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in @entity134			1
" very quickly after the @entity134 conflict , the major killer of civilians ( was ) not antipersonnel mines or anti-vehicle mines or conventional munitions , but these munitions , " said lt. col. @entity141 , a military adviser to the @entity142			0
in more than 20 countries , according to the @entity86 , cluster bombs have created lasting " no - go " areas , rendering them as dangerous as minefields			1
@entity147 is the most affected country			0
millions of bomblets dropped during the @entity149 continue to kill civilians more than three decades later			1
still , militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area , such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape			1
a single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles .			0

111 countries formally agreeing treaty banning cluster bombs
@entity60 not attending and not expected to agree to banning cluster bombs
*controversial* weapons often do *n't* explode but stay dangerous for civilians
@entity76 estimates 1 million bomblets dropped in 2006 @entity12 war still unexploded
