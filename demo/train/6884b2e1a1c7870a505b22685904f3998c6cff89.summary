@entity0 -- a group of pro-hillary @entity4 super pacs had it all figured out a few months ago : one would handle the email list , another the rapid response and another would spearhead the big - dollar fundraising			1
strategists touted their cohesion and efficiency , two attributes they admitted were not usually applied to @entity14 groups			1
but the excitement they created around a possible presidential bid had a somewhat unintended byproduct when a few eager and ambitious young politicos with no connection to @entity4 or her aides realized that they , too , could get in on the early organizing game by starting their own super pacs			1
so that 's what they did			2
and while these organizers feel they are just adding their voice to the chorus of pro-clinton groups , representatives from those pacs with longstanding ties to the former first lady and secretary of state see the new entries as an uncontrollable variable			1
inside politics : @entity38 gives @entity4 an ' f ' as secretary of state and these organizers feel that could siphon attention from other efforts to get @entity4 to run			1
right now , there are at least eight @entity47 super pacs registered with the @entity48			1
the highest - profile groups -- ready for @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- have deep connections to the @entity54 and are staffed by longtime confidants who regularly attend @entity4 events and receptions			1
but then there are the unaffiliated groups -- @entity50 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , madam @entity50 and more			1
not only are these unaffiliated groups created out of the excitement stirred by the larger pacs , but they are also , in some ways , copying the message that is working			1
making strategic sense " i entirely believe that with so much support from so many young politicos , this is really shining a light at the importance of young progressives , " said @entity69 , the co-founder of @entity70 , who has zero ties to clinton - land			2
" we like her and i feel like that is going to encourage her decision			1
" that grassroots mission statement is similar to what @entity86 founders said when in 2013 , strategists talked about getting young progressives so excited that their enthusiasm would compel @entity4 to run			1
and the similarities are n't lost on the more established groups			1
clintons in @entity93 for @entity95 's graduation " a bottom - up effort like @entity86 wo n't discourage any grassroots supporters from expressing their enthusiasm or organizing , " said a person familiar with @entity86 for @entity50 's view of other super pacs			1
" at the same time , it makes more sense strategically to have one vehicle and build one massive list of supporters , because that 's what will put @entity50 in the strongest position possible should she decide to run			2
" the issue is n't that these groups are stepping on fundraising toes			1
since organizing earlier this year , @entity50 2016 has gained fewer than 100 followers on @entity113 and has raised a total of $ 0 , according to the group			0
despite that start , @entity69 says they will bank a decent amount after their first fundraiser in june and plan to have one each month after that			0
his attitude is that you have to start somewhere and his pac is in the beginning of the building process			0
by comparison , @entity86 has raised nearly $ 6 million from more than 55,000 donors since organizing in early 2013			0
while many of these donors come from small , grassroots events that cost $ 20.16 ( get it ? ) to attend , a number have been high - profile @entity4 supporters and confidants			1
the group has also begun moving into the endorsement game , securing @entity4 support from @entity139 mayor @entity138 and sen. @entity140 of @entity141 in the past week			1
' we kind of roll our eyes ' when another super pac emerges that has n't stopped some from worrying , though			2
" legitimately , i can understand why it concerns people , " said a source close to a @entity47 super pac who asked not to be identified in order to speak more candidly			2
" we do n't know who these people are			0
... the good thing about @entity86 is they channel all the excitement			0
it seems to me it would be more beneficial to have @entity86 be the mother ship			0
" the source added , " we kind of roll our eyes every time we see a new super @entity62 has filed			2
" representatives from @entity86 said they have not yet reached out to the founders of @entity163 pac			0
in the past , the group has reached out to other @entity47 super pacs to talk about possibly working together			1
@entity69 said that he did n't start the group to get pulled into @entity86 because he wants to lead his own organization			0
" we all have different political idea and idea for political success , " @entity69 added in an apparent knock on @entity86			0
@entity172 takes shot at @entity173 " to be honest with you , i do n't think i expect it , " @entity69 added about meeting with @entity86			0
" it was n't an expectation of mine			0
" the concern among the super pacs close to @entity4 is twofold			1
one , they worry that these groups will make mistakes and muddy what they had hoped would be a clean and efficient effort			2
even if these groups are small , they say , their impact on that front could be outsized			2
" anyone can start one of these organizations and raise money and then eventually , if they are successful , start running ads , " said @entity191 , an except on super pacs and campaign finance laws			1
" having these super pacs support you is a double edged sward			1
... the problem is that you ca n't control their message , so someone could go out there and start running ads who thinks they are helping @entity209 , even though she might not like the message			0
" secondly , some representatives from organization 's closer to @entity4 also question the motives of the smaller groups , especially the idea that starting a super pac is a way to get possible get a job with a hypothetical presidential campaign			1
angling for campaign jobs ? representatives for @entity70 played coy about whether they would want campaign jobs			0
" at this current moment , that is not an interest of ours , " @entity69 said when the group launched in april , pausing before he added this caveat : " but of course we are always open to anything			0
times change and things change			0
" not all agree that the proliferation of pro-clinton groups is a bad thing , though			2
to some , including @entity237 , a senior adviser to correct the @entity52 , the process is " healthy and uniquely " @entity238			0
" " as long as @entity238 are looking to support her and promote her and encourage her , that is a great thing , " @entity237 said			0
he added , however , this caveat : " when all of this filters out , the pretenders will be outed and they will be out of the way and those who are for real will be there to the bitter end			0
they will be right there at the end			0
" on the other side of the spectrum , @entity250 super pacs are both experiencing their own splintering and watching the @entity47 side with amusement			1
although @entity257 has become the top @entity258 super pac against @entity4 , there is also @entity249 and a handful of other small groups			1
@entity261 , the spokesman for stop @entity62 , said while his group is n't focusing on what the pro-clinton groups are doing , he does find it comical that random efforts are beginning to sprout up			2
" it is interesting watching all these groups build up around @entity50 , " @entity261 said			2
" it is quite curious , if not comical			0
" he added that he hopes more republicans will begin to organize @entity250 efforts and said it will make the overall campaign against her better			0
" @entity275 will filter out those that are inferior , " he said			0
" this is the same with pro-hillary groups			2
" @entity38 puts himself back into 2016 conversation			0

some with no connection to @entity4 have started their own super pacs
organizers of established pacs feel *upstarts* are uncontrollable variables
*anti-clinton* groups are also springing up around more established super pacs
