-- on tuesday , the @entity1 will confront the profound impact of new location - tracking technologies on @entity5 ' privacy			1
the case , @entity5 v. @entity7 , presents the question of whether law enforcement needs a warrant before planting a gps tracking device on a person 's car			1
the answer to this question is important in its own right , but the case is likely to have broader implications			0
attaching a gps to a car is n't the only way the government can track people 's movements			1
in fact , everyone with a cell phone is already carrying a device that the government can use to track his or her location			2
as a result , the principle at stake in this case may well shape our privacy rights in the years and decades to come			1
the police in the current case suspected @entity7 of drug violations and tracked his movements continuously for one month by installing a gps device on his car			1
increasingly , though , law enforcement agents are tracking our movements by tracking the cell phones that most people are already carrying around			1
it does n't matter whether your phone is a smartphone or whether you use it to make calls ; as long as your phone is turned on , it registers its location with cell phone networks several times a minute , and all @entity5 cell phone companies hold on to that data , some of them for years			0
this kind of tracking is extremely invasive , because if the government knows where you are , it knows who you are			0
as the @entity7 appellate court explained in its ruling that the government violated the @entity69 , " a person who knows all of another 's travels can deduce whether he is a weekly churchgoer , a heavy drinker , a regular at the gym , an unfaithful husband , an outpatient receiving medical treatment , an associate of particular individuals or political groups -- and not just one such fact about a person , but all such facts			0
" cell phone tracking can reveal our private associations and relationships with one another			2
the government could make note of whenever people being tracked crossed path or spent time together , showing who our friends , associates and lovers are			0
the @entity97 sometimes gets warrants to track location , and some local police departments make it a policy , which shows that it 's not an unworkable requirement			0
but state and federal judges across the country have made conflicting rulings on what standards are required for the government to obtain tracking information from cell phone companies			2
new technology provides the government with a powerful and inexpensive tool to follow individuals as they travel through both public and private areas			0
unless the court concludes that such tracking requires a warrant , anyone 's movements could be subject to remote monitoring and permanent recording at the sole discretion of any curious police officer , without any judicial oversight			2
and while it may not be realistic to think that the government will install a gps device on every car , it 's not at all implausible to think that the government will ask cell phone providers to turn over location - tracking information en masse -- and it may well be the case that the government is doing so already			1
it was revealed last month that the @entity139 police have a system that lets them track hundreds of phones in real time in a targeted geographic area , a technology that could easily enable the government to identify everyone at an occupy protest , tea party rally or any other political gathering			2
the genius of the @entity151 is that its limits on the government can still be applied in a modern world that the framers could scarcely have imagined			0
anyone who values privacy should hope that the @entity1 ensures the government can not use technological advances to undermine the liberties this country was founded on			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

should law enforcement need a warrant before planting a gps tracking device on a car ?
yes , the @entity1 ought to decide that they should , says @entity164
the principle at stake in a current case may well shape our privacy rights , she says
all of us can already easily be tracked through our cell phones , @entity164 says
