@entity0 , @entity1 -- what do you say when you meet one of the most iconic statesmen in the world ? @entity8 holds baby @entity9 as @entity10 and her husband @entity11 look on			1
for someone who makes a living out of communications , i have consistently been tongue - tied around @entity8			1
the funny thing is i am not particularly star - struck -- as a @entity2 correspondent i get to interview and profile all sorts of " famous " people			2
it 's just a not a big deal for me			1
however , with @entity8 ( as @entity8 is often called ) , i feel like every moment spent with him is a gift , a blessing that i will tell my grandchildren about one day			1
as a @entity1 he has a place in our hearts that is hard to define			2
however , my stories about my encounters with @entity8 are the stuff of comedy clubs			1
i 've never quite managed to hold my own with him			2
i always land up somehow embarrassing myself when i am around him ; i 've slipped on shiny presidential floors , got tangled up in camera equipment and made pathetically inane comments			2
i first met @entity8 in the early 1990s			1
i ca n't remember exactly when , but it was at the @entity41 cricket stadium in @entity0			0
he visited the vip room , during a test match , where i was working during school vacations and everybody lined up to meet him			0
i stood proudly and waited my turn , he came over to me			0
he said to me , " you are so gracious , i am so humbled to meet you			0
" i remember thinking , if @entity8 thinks i am gracious -- fantastic			1
i promptly turned around and ungraciously tripped on my best shoes , tumbling into the crowd behind me			0
i was the one humbled			0
years later , i was a young reporter working for the @entity52 during @entity8 's presidency			1
i was n't senior enough to cover the big political stories of the day so news editors only assigned me the light hearted @entity8 news stories			1
the one i remember most was around a birthday or @entity62 during which there was a photo opportunity at one of his grandson 's kindergartens			1
@entity66 had got out among the press that " twinkle twinkle little star " was @entity8 's favorite nursery rhyme , so , of course , all the children sang it for him			1
i sang along too , twinkle - finger actions included , it 's a great song			1
whether it was or not @entity8 's favorite , is not something i have ever asked him			1
years after that , i was taking a sabbatical from journalism and spent a year studying for my masters degree at @entity80			0
@entity8 just happened to be an honorary fellow at @entity82 , where i was studying			1
he came to visit that year , giving a speech in the college 's beautiful cloisters			2
i waved at him , as he passed by all of us students assembled in the quadrangle			0
of course , he did n't wave back , but i felt gracious and humbled in his presence , protected by @entity82 's great walls			2
and then i turned to my awe - struck friends and said , " did you know his favorite song is ' @entity96 ? ' " -- which kind of killed the moment			0
fast forward a few more years , i reported on @entity8 occasionally during my time as a correspondent at @entity99 's bureau			1
from a distance , i saw him get older and shakier on his feet			0
his hair got whiter and his public engagements lessened considerably			0
once in while , i would regale my friends with @entity8 's stories -- yes , there are more -- like the time i sneaked into the bathroom in his presidential mansion , desperate for relief , before a long - delayed press conference and phoned a friend from within to ask whether it was morally right to steal some of @entity8 's soap			1
it is n't very gracious )			0
or the time , i asked @entity117 , his devoted personal assistant , to take a photo of me and @entity8 together before i went up to @entity120			1
he agreed and came over to me , throwing his arm around me and giving me squeeze a and joking , " ah , i am sure your boyfriend will be jealous			0
" did you know that @entity8 is a terrible flirt ? again , i became self - conscious			1
i was carrying my handbag over my shoulder and i did n't want the photo to look like i was @entity129 or my grandmother , for that matter , constantly clutching a handbag			0
so with his arm still firm around my middle , i bent down to put my handbag on the floor			0
that 's when @entity117 took the photo ... unfortunately ; the automatic flash went off on my camera			2
that 's a complete no - no around @entity8 -- his eyes were damaged during his years of imprisonment on @entity143 and flash photography is forbidden			1
so they whizzed away , slightly peeved , and i landed up with a " @entity149 " photograph that showed the president grinning into camera , holding me around the waist and me half bent over , lowering my handbag , with my head half cocked and eyes half closed			0
it was not mantelpiece material			0
i never thought i 'd meet him again , up close and personal , until , last year when @entity117 , ever the diplomat , like her boss , invited to me to introduce my newly born daughter , @entity9 , to him			2
my husband @entity11 and i had just returned back to live in @entity1 , after nearly six years away in @entity159			0
it was oddly nerve - racking , and i did what i always do in his presence i acted incredibly gauche , stupid and clumsy			0
i kept on saying : " so how are you ? " as if he 'd offer me a glass of wine , and say , " @entity173 know @entity10 , my knees are killing me , i 'm bit worried about the situation in @entity166 and howz about them @entity169 ? " i offered my baby to him , like a little sacrificial lamb			1
the pictures tell it all			0
the ones we sent to friends ( and everybody we knew ) , show us laughing with the world 's greatest statesman			2
the ones we did n't email to the world show our daughter freaking out and crying			2
@entity8 tried to placate her by wagging a finger at her and telling her , " i am your great great grandfather			1
" she freaked out some more			0
i think she takes after her mother .			0

@entity10 first met @entity8 in 1990 and has encountered him several times
meetings usually ended less than graciously for @entity10
last encounter saw @entity8 trying placate @entity10 's upset daughter
