-- sen. @entity2 's announcement that he is retiring follows an illustrious career , but one that has recently been overshadowed by controversies , political woes and personal tragedies			1
" i love my job as your senator			0
i always have , still do			0
however , this past year has raised some challenges that insisted i take stock of my life , " the @entity11 senator said in front of his @entity14 home wednesday			1
during this session of @entity19 , @entity2 was at the center of what he called the " two most important issues of our time " : health care and financial reform			1
@entity2 is chairman of the banking committee , and when his close friend and colleague , the late sen. @entity30 , was battling brain cancer , he stepped in as acting chairman of the @entity34 health committee			1
the death of @entity30 in august was devastating for @entity2 , who worked alongside the @entity37 senator for decades			1
and @entity30 's death came just weeks after @entity2 's sister passed away			1
and @entity2 , 65 , was diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer last summer			1
" in the midst of all of this , [ i ] found myself in the toughest political shape of my career , " @entity2 said wednesday			1
a source close to @entity2 says his recent personal tragedies and challenges weighed heavily in his decision to retire			2
@entity2 is @entity14 's longest - serving senator			1
he took office in 1981 after three terms in the @entity52			0
but his prospects in the upcoming election were not good			0
an internal @entity2 campaign poll taken last month showed him trailing the leading @entity57 contender for his seat , @entity59 , 46 - 51 percent			1
that deficit is significant in the @entity11 - leaning state of @entity14 , where the same poll shows president @entity63 with a high favorability rating			1
another source close to @entity2 said he had been well aware of his uphill battle for months			2
the source said his political reality was a big part the reason he decided not to seek re-election , but insisted , " this is n't a decision forced upon him or by anyone			0
he was looking at his career , looking at his record of accomplishments over the past 35 years , asking what else is there			2
" personal and political challenges " have given me pause to take stock and to ask questions that too few of us in elected public life ever do : why am i running ? , " @entity2 said			2
@entity2 's announcement came almost two years to the day that he abandoned his presidential run			1
he said at the time that he counted his experience on the presidential campaign trail as one of the most rewarding of his career in public service			0
" it was obviously an uphill battle from the beginning , and i think that those are the times that you really see the character of the person that you are working for , " said @entity93 , a @entity11 strategist who worked on @entity2 's campaign			1
" he conducted that campaign in the way that i 've seen him do everything else , which was with a lot of class and a lot of dedication , " she said			0
@entity109 recalled @entity2 's humor and his love for the people he met			1
" he is someone who wears his heart on his sleeve , and that 's part of the reason why people are drawn to him , " she said			0
@entity109 said she looks forward to watching what @entity2 can accomplish over the next year , now that he is freed up from campaign concerns			1
following a disappointing showing in his presidential campaign -- getting less than 1 percent of the vote in the @entity123 caucuses -- @entity2 faced more struggles back home and in @entity126			1
the senator was criticized last year for his role in big bonuses handed out at @entity130 after the insurance giant received taxpayer bailout money			2
@entity130 's @entity134 unit is based in @entity14			1
@entity2 initially denied having anything to do with @entity130 paying out millions in bonuses , then later acknowledged his role in adding language to the stimulus bill to ensure that existing contracts for bonuses at bailout recipients , such as @entity130 , were honored			2
@entity2 also faced controversy when news surfaced that he had received favorable mortgage terms from now - defunct sub-prime mortgage lender @entity144			1
@entity2 later severed his relationship with @entity144 to avoid any appearance of impropriety			2
in another blow to his credibility , @entity2 took heat for insisting that the government - sponsored mortgage lenders @entity151 and @entity154 were sound and failing to rein them in			2
the @entity156 he chairs oversees the lenders			0
@entity2 had also received more campaign contributions from @entity151 and @entity154 than any other lawmaker , according to the @entity160			0
even with help on the trail from president @entity63 and vice president @entity163 , @entity2 was n't able to gain much ground in the polls			0
@entity163 last month conceded that @entity2 was " getting the living hell beat of him			0
" despite his troubles , @entity2 said he managed four major pieces of legislation through @entity19 in the past year : health care reform , credit card reform , the tobacco regulation bill and the @entity174			1
throughout his career , he 's focused on children 's issues , championing the @entity178 , working to expand the @entity180 program and chairing the @entity182 subcommittee			1
@entity2 will serve out the rest of his term , which ends in january 2011			0
" this year will be a huge part of his legacy			0
we 're looking at the likelihood that we will have an enormous piece of health care reform that his father actually introduced as a plank in the @entity11 platform 60 years ago			0
getting that done is going to be a huge part of his legacy , " @entity109 said			0
@entity2 attributes his commitment to public service and human rights to his parents , the late sen. @entity200 and @entity201 , according to his @entity34 biography			2
@entity2 's father served in the @entity34 for two terms			2
he was censured by the @entity34 for financial misconduct , then lost his re-election bid in 1970			1
he died of a heart attack the following year			0
before his career in politics , @entity2 spent two years in the @entity210 , enlisted in the @entity211 and served in the @entity212			2
he attended @entity213 and later earned a law degree from the @entity215			0
@entity2 declined to speculate about what he will do when he leaves office , but he said his two daughters -- @entity201 , 8 , and @entity219 , 4 -- will benefit greatly from his decision			0
" i 'm still driven by the same passions that motivated me to try my hand at politics so many , many years ago			0
