just hours before the 2012 @entity2 season kicks off , a new study suggests that professional football players are three times more likely to have neurodegenerative diseases than the general population			1
when researchers specifically looked at @entity8 and @entity9 -- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , also known as @entity12 's disease -- that risk increased to four times greater than the rest of us			1
the study , published wednesday in the medical journal @entity19 , surveyed nearly 3,500 retired @entity2 players who were in the league between 1959 and 1988			1
the @entity22 , a division of the @entity23 , had been following this group of players since the early ' 90s , when the @entity2 asked the institute to evaluate them for their risk of cardiovascular disease			1
this time , the authors decided to look at the neurological outcomes of the players by specifically evaluating the autopsies of 334 players			2
" we looked at all the death certificates , and @entity35 's , @entity8 's and @entity9 had significant contribution to the death , " according to study co-author @entity38			1
when tallying those specific diseases , the authors found that among the 334 players , seven had died from @entity8 's and another seven with @entity9			1
three players had died with @entity42 , but the authors did n't find that to be significant when compared with the larger population			2
the average age of the players who had died was 57			0
those numbers may seem small , but as @entity50 explains , " these are generally rare diseases , especially at the younger age			0
even when looking at the general population , you 're generally going to have small numbers			1
" however , the numbers , although small , were still considered statistically significant , according to @entity50 , an epidemiologist at the @entity22			0
more than 2,000 former professional football players are currently suing the @entity2 , claiming that the league " downplayed and misrepresented the issues and misled players concerning the risks associated with concussions			1
" the @entity2 has repeatedly stated that player safety is a priority and that " any allegation that the @entity2 intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit			2
" @entity67 linebacker choosing career over concussions while the study published wednesday did not examine players ' concussion history of the players , researchers did investigate whether the position played made a difference			2
the study authors found that players in speed positions like wide receivers and running backs were three times more likely to develop neurodegenerative disease than players in non-speed or lineman positions			1
" there 's a lot of velocity , " @entity38 said			0
however , " we have to be very careful and note that we do n't know if this is a result of concussions , " says @entity89 , associate professor of neurology at the @entity91			2
" are these increased risks because of exposure to contact ? in their words , there 's an assumption that there is causality there			0
i think a general lifestyle of playing sport at a competitive level is abusive			0
it 's hard to do physically and mentally			0
" in addition , genetics and family history may also be factors for dementia and @entity8 's but were n't accounted for in the study			1
studies have linked repeated concussions in football players to chronic traumatic encephelopathy , a neurodegenerative disease with @entity8 's - like symptoms			1
those symptoms can include depression , memory loss and mood swings			0
former @entity126 safety @entity124 , who committed suicide , was diagnosed with @entity129 postmortem			0
it can be diagnosed only after death			0
player 's text : send my brain to @entity2 research bank research on @entity129 shows commonalities with @entity9 and @entity8 's , and examining the neurodegenerative diseases might be the best way to look at it , @entity38 said			1
" @entity129 maybe one of the outcomes or causes , but we just ca n't tell			0
" dr. @entity144 , co-director of the @entity145 and chair of the @entity147 , said , " a study like this is very limited in its scope and how deep they can dig down			0
it 's merely an observation in reporting in cause and death , and you can only draw so much -- but it supports in general a trend that we 've seen , that neurodegenerative disease impacts football players			2
" dr. @entity160 , a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at @entity163 , agrees			0
" in general , it provides further evidence that repetitive brain trauma is associated with the development of neurodegenerative disease , like @entity129 , later in life , " he said			0
asked about the new study , the @entity2 said in a statement : " well before this study was released , the @entity2 took significant steps to address head injuries in football , provide medical and financial assistance to our retired players , and raise awareness of the most effective ways to prevent , manage and treat concussions			1
" the league announced wednesday that it had awarded a $ 30 million unrestricted grant to the @entity184 to support research into @entity129 , concussion management and treatment , as well as examining the relationship between traumatic brain injuries and late - life neurodegenerative disorders , including @entity8 .			2
