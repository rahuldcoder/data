-- the next generation is just a few weeks away for the world 's hottest smartphone without a piece of fruit on it			0
the @entity8 will be unveiled march 14 at a @entity10 event , the company announced monday			1
the release will mark the latest assault in what 's rapidly become a two - phone race for supremacy on the mobile landscape			2
@entity17 confirmed the plans at @entity19 , the massive tech show currently under way in @entity22 , @entity23			1
@entity17 unveiled a new tablet there but , taking a page from @entity28 's playbook , opted not to roll out its flagship phone during the crowded event where many rival products are clamoring for attention			1
" we introduced the @entity38 in @entity39 last year , and this time we changed the venue ( to @entity10 ) ... as we were bombarded with requests from @entity43 mobile carriers to unveil the @entity8 in the country , " @entity33 , the head of @entity34 , was quoted as saying by @entity36 media			1
the company followed with a post on @entity47 containing the less - than - subtle message , " march 14			1
ready 4 the show ? " the post linked to a promo inviting people to " come and meet the next @entity53			0
" details on the new phone 's features are scarce , although analysts expect that it will have a higher - resolution screen			2
all but the most ardent of tech pundits have abandoned the idea that a mythical " @entity65 killer " will emerge from @entity28 's bevy of competitors			2
but in the @entity38 , the fragmented field of phones running on @entity70 's @entity69 operating system found a champion : a single gadget to put forward for an apples to apples ( if you will ) comparison to the iconic @entity65			1
and the results ca n't have made folks in @entity78 happy			0
how @entity17 is out - innovating @entity28 in the third quarter of last year , the @entity38 became the first smartphone to outsell the @entity65			1
the @entity38 shipped 18 million units worldwide in that three - month span from july to september , compared with 16.2 million for the @entity83 , according to research by @entity85			2
with the release of the @entity65 , @entity28 retook the lead in the final months of 2012 , selling an estimated 27 million			0
but the @entity38 hung in there with another 15 million units sold			0
the companies have also been engaged in a nasty $ 1 billion patent battle			0
and @entity17 has stepped up its advertising in a major way , with @entity28 squarely in its sights			0
the @entity36 company was a sponsor of sunday night 's @entity97 telecast , and it and @entity28 went head - to - head with big advertising buys during the broadcast .			0
