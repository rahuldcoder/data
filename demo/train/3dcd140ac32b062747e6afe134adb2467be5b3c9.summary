his daredevil stunts have attracted over 3.5 million hits on @entity3 and reached uncharted waters for sailing , but for his next trick @entity6 just wants to get back to doing what he does best -- circumnavigating the globe faster than anyone else			1
his " crazy ideas " have ended up with the 40 - year - old walking along the keel of his @entity14 yacht and then -- even more daringly -- scaling the height of its huge sail before diving into the water			1
@entity6 was dressed for both stunts in the stylish menswear associated with his sponsor			1
their longstanding relationship dates back to 2003 , with @entity6 having made headlines in a more conventional sporting manner through his exploits in long - distance ocean racing			1
as far back as 1999 he became the youngest skipper to win a round the world race , and he 's a multiple record - holder for distance covered in 24 hours at sea			1
but perhaps the biggest prize , the @entity37 -- the ultimate single - handed round the world race , sailed nonstop and without assistance -- has eluded him			1
" it 's a supreme test of human endeavor , truly man against the elements , " the @entity41 sailor told @entity42			2
" i equate it to challenging for an @entity48 gold in a four - year cycle , and you must peak at the right time			1
" @entity51 ( the four - time gold medalist from @entity41 in sailing ) does this perfectly and i want to emulate him			2
" there are still two and a half years to the start of the next @entity37 race in @entity57 in southwest @entity58 , but for @entity60 it can not come around fast enough			1
his 2008 challenge was ruined by a collision with a fishing boat which wrecked his preparations , and he finished third in the 2012 edition			0
@entity6 finished just over two days behind winner @entity67 of @entity58 after 80 days of racing , setting a @entity41 record for a solo round the world race in the process			1
" the big win has eluded me , " he said			2
@entity41 ambition @entity75 , who won his @entity48 golds in dinghy classes , has announced he will lead an ambitious $ 134 million @entity41 bid to win the @entity79 in 2017			0
one of the key members of that syndicate is @entity82 , a businessman who ran @entity41 's successful bid for the @entity84 and is a co-founder of the @entity87 team			2
the planning required for the @entity79 is on a similar scale to the @entity37 -- but instead of being part of a big crew , @entity90 will be on his own as he negotiates his way around dangerous oceans at the helm of a 10 - ton , 60 - foot yacht			1
" the boats are absolute beasts with a sail area of three tennis courts alone , " said the @entity98 , who was born in the coastal town of @entity100			0
" it very much depends whether you are physically fit enough to do this kind of thing			0
" his eponymous team 's current boat successfully competed in long - distance events under previous owners , winning the 2010 - 11 @entity114			1
it has been extensively refitted and a new keel added to keep pace with the opposition			2
" it 's like @entity122 , with thousands of things to do and test , " said @entity90 in equating the scale of the challenge			0
unlike @entity122 , the chance to test equipment in race conditions is limited -- " and we do n't have the budgets of the likes of @entity130			0
" although 2016 appears a long way off , the team have to make the most of the opportunities			0
" we have two or three big events and about 20,000 individual components that can go wrong , " @entity6 admitted			1
family commitment he had to sit out one of those events -- the @entity141 race from @entity142 to @entity114 -- because his wife was due to give birth to their second child			0
@entity147 , weighing in at seven pounds seven ounces , was indeed born at a time when a less attentive father might have been mid-atlantic			0
but the race provided a welcome boost for @entity60 's long - term aspirations as @entity155 @entity154 and his replacement -- @entity158 @entity157 -- took line honors after just over 14 days at sea			2
they took advantage when an accident on board rival @entity164 meant the race leader had to stop in @entity166 so one of its skippers could get medical treatment			0
while not a serious injury , it was a painful reminder of the inherent dangers in ocean racing			0
" the @entity175 is as dangerous as any place , particularly in the spring and winter , " @entity6 said			2
he will pair with @entity154 for the 2014 - 15 edition of the @entity114 , which starts on @entity178 from the @entity180 city and will finish in its port by the end of march 2015			0
then it will be back to fine - tuning for the @entity37 , where victory and the likely chance of being crowned winner of the @entity188 is firmly in his sights			1
and , as for any more eye - catching stunts , @entity6 is keeping his cards close to his chest			1
" we usually do them around september and it takes a fair bit of planning , " he revealed			0
" perhaps the most important thing is that it showcases our sport to people who do n't sail and maybe we can tempt people to take it up			0

@entity6 *renowned* for his daredevil yachting stunts
@entity6 's mast and keel walks were big hits on @entity3

he does not rule out doing another stunt in the future
