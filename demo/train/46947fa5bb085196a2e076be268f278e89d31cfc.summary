-- topless photos of @entity2 , hit newsstands in yet another country thursday , as a magazine in @entity5 became at least the fifth outlet to run the pictures causing headaches for @entity10 's likely future queen			1
the @entity5 gossip magazine @entity12 ran the photos a day after its sister publication in @entity15 did			1
they 're the same photos first seen last week in the @entity21 magazine closer , then in an @entity23 magazine and an @entity25 newspaper , @entity17 editor @entity16 said			1
" it 's a set of unique photos from an @entity29 celebrity			0
we are a leading gossip magazine in @entity5 , and it is my job to publish them , " @entity16 said			1
" if the @entity10 royal family want to sue us , then it will happen then and we 'll deal with it			0
" closer was fined tuesday for publishing the topless photographs , and ordered not to distribute the magazine in print or online			2
a @entity21 court ordered the magazine to hand over the original photos to the royal family within 24 hours of the ruling and to pay them 2,000 euros ( about $ 2,600 )			1
the magazine must pay a further 10,000 euros a day if it is late in handing over the photos			2
the magazine declined to say whether it has complied with the order			2
a @entity21 prosecutor opened a preliminary criminal investigation into the incident tuesday , separate from the royal family 's civil suit , the @entity53 prosecutor 's office said			1
the royal family filed a criminal complaint seeking invasion of privacy charges against closer and possibly the photographer , a palace spokeswoman said			1
@entity12 's editor in @entity15 , @entity66 , would not discuss the identity of the photographer , but she did say her magazine bought the images friday			0
the criminal and civil legal battle over the photographs would not deter the magazine , she said			2
" we do n't treat royalties different to other celebrities , so we would have published the photos anyway , " she said			2
" we valued the news value			0
" a spokesman for the royal family declined to comment on the @entity5 and @entity15 magazines ' decisions " save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review			0
" @entity86 : the backward view of women 's bodies @entity2 and her husband , prince @entity91 , the second in line to the throne , " welcome the injunction that 's been granted			1
they always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy , " the palace said			0
@entity21 law provides for " draconian sanctions " to protect against invasions of privacy , @entity10 lawyer @entity101 said , including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines			0
@entity111 : keeping calm and carrying on @entity113 and @entity63 are owned by the @entity115 publishing company , which is headed by @entity116 , daughter of former @entity23 prime minister @entity117			0
opinion : wake up , @entity2 ; photogs are always watching @entity0 's @entity120 contributed to this report .			0
