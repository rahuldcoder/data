with his 1.2 million @entity24 followers and teen fan base , he said he believes he can help create a movement that shows bullying is n't cool			1
" if enough people really stand up to it , i feel like it 's something that can really be defeated , " he said			2
one in five high school students have been bullied , according to the 2009 @entity57 by the @entity58			2

defeat the @entity13 spokeswoman @entity125 said , " our goal is to end bullying â € ” to get people to wake up and stand up against the bully , not just in @entity6 , not just in @entity1 , but across the nation			1
" while some anti-bullying programs target the bully or victim , this one is aimed at the bystander			0
as @entity141 explained , bystanders â € ” whether they 're students , parents or teachers â € ” do n't necessarily know how to respond			2
" we want the bystander to say ' no , ' to stand up against the bully just as much as we want the victim to stand up against the bully , " @entity141 said			2
but not everyone agrees with that strategy			0
a 2010 @entity148 study of 11,893 students in grades five through 12 found that victims do n't want their peers to call out a bully			2

@entity156 , who co-wrote the report , said it 's these small day - to - day actions that are needed to reduce bullying			0

for example , 16 % said telling the bully his / her feelings made the problem better			0
but 34 % of students reported that the issue improved after seeking help from an adult			0

today , many of her fans send her messages about how they are being bullied			0
