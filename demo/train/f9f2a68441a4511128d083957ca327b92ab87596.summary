forget about the big screen , the small screen and even the second screen			1
a headset due to be released this year promises to beam movies , video games or even video calls directly into your eyeballs			1
the @entity10 headset , from @entity11 , @entity13 - based @entity12 , will create visuals that do n't need a screen -- just your retinas and your brain			1
if that conjures up exciting images of living like " @entity21 's " @entity22 or cyclops from " the @entity24 , " you 're not alone			1
a @entity26 campaign was launched last month and set out to raise $ 250,000 to bankroll the project			1
it blew past that mark with ease and , with half a month left , was on the verge of breaking the $ 1 million mark wednesday			1
" we knew we had something really cool and that we 'd do well on @entity26 , but nobody thought we 'd hit our goal in less than four hours , " said @entity33 , @entity34 's ceo			1
" it 's like ordering flowers for your girlfriend and they show up with a whole truck full of flowers			1
" the technology that powers the @entity10 centers around a set of 2 million microscopic mirrors -- 1 million per eye -- that reflect visuals , including @entity53 , into the user 's eye			1
unlike some entries into the emerging wearable tech field , the @entity10 wo n't be limited to a set of specially designed apps			0
@entity33 said the headset , which donors can receive for a $ 499 " donation " to the campaign , is designed to plug into just about anything you own that has a screen -- be it a smartphone , laptop , television or gaming console			1
users would play the video content on their mobile or entertainment device but watch it on the @entity10 instead of their device 's screen			1
the @entity10 has a battery life of about three hours , @entity33 said			0
" i think @entity80 is really interesting ... ( but ) i think it 's a couple years away , " he said			2
" if you ask people what they 're doing with their devices today , they 're streaming @entity88 , they 're playing video games and they 're listening to music			0
we created a device that really focused on those aspects			0
" the startup also wanted to avoid the " @entity96 " effect			0
@entity97 promises @entity80 will be stylish when it 's released to the public , but the look of early test versions has been distracting to some and downright jarring to others			1
@entity104 , on the other hand , looks like a pair of headphones sitting on the user 's head when not in use			1
in fact , it doubles as a pair of high - end headphones with noise canceling that compares with some of the leading brands on the market , according to @entity12			0
to add visuals , the user flips down the band over their head , making it an eyepiece			2
the company has opened the headset to outside developers , who they hope will find unexpected uses for its features , which include head - tracking technology			2
" by giving developers this brand new tool box , they start to think of amazing applications that we could n't in our wildest dreams come up with , " @entity33 said			0
@entity135 always said not to sit too close to the tv set			0
and we all know that bleary - eyed feeling we get from staring at a smartphone or tablet for too long			0
wo n't this be worse ? quite the opposite , @entity33 said			0
he said eye fatigue comes from staring at the artificial , pixelated light from our screens			0
remove the screen , remove the problem			2
" we agree with the moms of the world , " he said			0
" what we 're doing is mimicking the actual light around you ...			0
it 's the kind of light that your eyes have been conditioned to see , have evolved to see			1
" it 's all so magically futuristic sounding			2
which raises an obvious question : is @entity104 all hype ? folks who have taken an early look do n't think so			1
at january 's @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity104 was one of 40 products chosen for the editor 's @entity168			1
more than 3,200 exhibitors attended the show			0
" what i could tell was that the projected image , just like my last time with @entity12 's virtual retinal display tech , was exceedingly bright and vivid , lacking any sense of pixelation , " @entity173 's @entity172 wrote from @entity165			2
" a deep - sea 3 - d movie looked like it was projected in a tiny little movie theater in front of my eyes			2
" @entity183 wrote for @entity184 : " ' @entity185 ' displayed perfectly in @entity53 without any tweaking , and i played ' call of duty : ghosts ' right off a @entity190			0
all you need to do is to tune the glasses â€” you focus each eye individually , then set the two eyeholes the right distance apart so they create a single picture			0
from then on , content just works			0
" the @entity26 campaign runs through february 21			1
@entity12 plans to ship units to donors by the end of the year and says the model that will ship will be smaller and lighter than the test models on display			2
@entity12 is based in the heart of @entity13 's manufacturing region and hopes to manufacture the @entity10 as much as possible in the @entity207 , @entity33 said .			0

@entity104 promises to project images directly into the user 's eyes , brain
the headset has raised nearly $ 1 million on @entity26
it 's *compatible* with smartphones , tvs , gaming consoles and most anything with a screen
it 's going for $ 499 and expected to be released late this year
