@entity14 did not testify at his trial			2
prosecutors had asked that @entity14 be given a life sentence , saying the 30 - year minimum was not enough because @entity14 abused his badge			1

@entity14 retired from the @entity6 in 1990 and later was indicted on federal racketeering and other charges stemming from his long relationship with @entity92 and @entity102			1
he was convicted of racketeering in 2002 and was serving a 10 - year federal prison sentence when he was indicted in 2005 in the @entity25 slaying			1
