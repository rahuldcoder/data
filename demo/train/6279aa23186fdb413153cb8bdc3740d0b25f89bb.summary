-- was the killing of @entity2 legal under international law ? the administration says yes , absolutely			1
attorney general @entity6 told members of the @entity8 on wednesday that the @entity10 raid on @entity2 's compound was lawful " as an act of national self - defense			1
" @entity2 " was the head of @entity15 , an organization that had conducted the attacks of september the 11th , " @entity6 said			2
" it 's lawful to target an enemy commander in the field			0
" the raid " was conducted in a manner fully consistent with the laws of war , " @entity21 press secretary @entity20 told reporters			0
@entity20 declined to offer specifics , but said " there is simply no question that this operation was lawful			0
... ( @entity2 ) had continued to plot attacks against the @entity10			1
" presidents @entity32 , @entity34 and @entity35 had all issued orders to kill or capture the @entity15 leader			0
" the authority ( during the raid ) was to kill @entity2 , " cia director @entity38 said tuesday during an interview with @entity40			1
" obviously , under the rules of engagement , if he had in fact thrown up his hands , surrendered , and did n't appear to be representing any kind of threat , then they were to capture him			0
but they had full authority to kill him			0
" a number of experts have told @entity0 the question of actual legality may come down to @entity2 's response at the moment @entity58 burst into his room			1
" if a person has his hands in the air , you 're not supposed to kill him , " said @entity60 , a fellow at the conservative @entity61			0
@entity65 , the @entity67 high commissioner for human rights , told reporters she wants a " full disclosure " of the key facts			0
@entity10 officials have revised their account of the assault on the compound in @entity75			1
@entity2 was not armed during the 40 - minute raid , they now say , but he put up resistance to @entity10 forces			1
the @entity15 leader was moving at the time he was initially shot , according to a @entity10 official who has seen military reports of the incident			2
the official declined to describe the movements more specifically			0
asked if @entity2 tried to grab a weapon or physically attack a commando , the official would say only that " he did n't hold up his hands and surrender			1
" officials earlier claimed that @entity2 was an active participant in the firefight that erupted , implying that he was armed and gave the @entity58 little choice but to shoot him			2
@entity60 , citing the @entity92 and international humanitarian law , told @entity0 that , based on the most recent @entity21 account , " there is nothing to indicate anything illegal happened			2
" @entity2 , considered a combatant by virtue of his position as head of @entity15 , needed to immediately make clear a desire to surrender , if that was his decision , in order to avoid being shot			2
that apparently did n't happen , @entity60 said			0
" the @entity10 offered @entity2 the possibility to surrender , but he refused , " @entity107 , the @entity67 ' special rapporteur for human rights , said tuesday			1
" @entity2 would have avoided destruction if he had raised a white flag			2
" @entity113 , a human rights lawyer who has defended @entity115 founder @entity114 among others , made clear that international law requires any killing to be done in self - defense			1
if members of the seal team " reasonably ( believed there was ) a risk to themselves , then the killing was justified , " @entity113 asserted			0
but given the changing @entity21 account of the raid , " there needs to be an inquiry , " he said			0
@entity130 , head of @entity132 's @entity131 and a former @entity67 war crimes investigator , said that the " killing of any individual sought by law enforcement in the course of a lawful arrest is always a question of facts			1
did the person resist ? did the person have a deadly weapon ? were the arresting officers in fear of their lives ? these are all pertinent questions			0
" @entity130 stressed that any " extrajudicial execution of an unarmed person is in violation of international law			1
" " it is necessary for the @entity153 to conduct an internal investigation into the appropriateness of the use of armed force , " @entity130 told @entity0			0
" however , it is also important not to make the @entity58 be the scapegoats for ( any ) secret orders which the public is unaware of to simply kill @entity2 no matter what			2
" was the incursion of @entity10 forces into @entity75 territory without the clear permission of @entity166 legal ? in response to that question , the @entity10 intelligence official echoed @entity6 's and @entity20 's remarks , asserting that " since 9/11 , the @entity10 has had the authority to kill @entity2			1
" " the operation was the subject of a rigorous legal review and was planned in strict accord with @entity10 law , " the official said			1
" as a matter of international law , @entity15 has attacked the @entity10 and continues to pose an imminent threat to the @entity10			1
as such , the @entity10 may use force against @entity15 consistent with its inherent right to national self - defense under international law			1
" the operation " was conducted under the @entity187 's authorities contained in federal law , unlike most military operations which are under the control and legal authority of the @entity192 , " the official noted			2
@entity2 was an indicted international criminal who had evaded all attempts to apprehend him , @entity113 said			2
as a consequence , he asserted , the operation was legal			0
@entity60 argued the use of the seals in @entity75 does " present complications , " though he noted that there has been a " kind of a wink and a nod game ( the @entity10 government has ) been playing with the @entity75 for years " in terms of predator drone strikes and other attacks against @entity211 extremists on @entity75 soil			1
@entity130 argued that " the mission to capture was legal , even though there are some questions under international law about one state sending its forces into another state to kidnap a person wanted for trial			1
" the issue first arose in the early 1960s , @entity130 noted , when notorious @entity225 @entity224 was kidnapped by @entity227 agents in @entity228 and subsequently brought to @entity227 for trial			0
half a century later , that issue remains a matter of sharp dispute			0
@entity0 's @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report			0

the administration says the mission leading to @entity2 's death was legal
experts indicate the question of legality may come down to @entity2 's reaction to the raid
if @entity2 clearly tried to surrender , his killing may be illegal under international law
experts are divided on the legality of the use of @entity10 troops in @entity75
