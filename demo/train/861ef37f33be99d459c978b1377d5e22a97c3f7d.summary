-- the @entity3 men 's hockey team lost any dream of an @entity6 medal saturday when @entity7 crushed them 5 - 0 in the consolation game for the bronze medal in the @entity10			1
the loss was a major @entity3 disappointment in one of the @entity6 ' marquee events , especially after the @entity3 earlier beat the @entity15			0
@entity7 broke open the scoreless game in the second period , by scoring two successive goals in the opening minutes , embarrassing the @entity3 , who seemed uninspired			1
by the third period , the game was a blowout as the @entity3 team was unable to find the goal			1
the @entity3 appeared saturday to still be reeling from their loss this week to @entity26 , 1 - 0 , which meant that the @entity3 would be relegated to playing for the bronze medal and the @entity26 team advancing to sunday 's game for the gold			1
@entity3 entered the @entity6 with high hopes -- and a quest to redeem themselves after their performance in the last @entity34 in @entity35 in 2010 when they lost the gold - medal game to @entity26 3 - 2 in overtime and went home with a silver medal			2
in the @entity10 , the @entity3 team demonstrated early prowess when they beat the @entity41 5 - 2 and then archrival @entity15 3 - 2			2
but the @entity3 team then lost to @entity26 , which will play @entity42 on sunday			1
and then the @entity3 were shutout saturday			0
the @entity44 seemed to score at will in the third period , racking up three goals			0
at least the @entity3 women fared better in the @entity10			0
this week they took a silver medal after they lost the gold medal game to @entity26 in overtime , 3 - 2			0
the @entity6 ' hockey game has emerged as a sort of a world championship because many of hockey 's top pros play in the @entity34 for their respective countries			0
as so , the @entity7 team was loaded with @entity59 talent , as was the @entity3 team			1
the @entity7 team featured @entity59 players such as @entity63 's @entity62 , @entity65 's @entity64 and @entity67 ' @entity66			0
the @entity44 were a formidable team entering the bronze medal game because their two losses came to the two finalists who will be playing in sunday 's gold medal game -- @entity26 and @entity42 -- and because they knocked @entity15 out of the @entity73 .			2

@entity7 shuts out the @entity3 by scoring two goals in 2nd period , three in 3rd period
