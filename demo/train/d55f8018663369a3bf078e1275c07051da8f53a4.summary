-- this is n't a real - life recreation of " @entity4			0
" there 's no clear and present threat to @entity7			0
but @entity8 says it 's working on plans to send astronauts into space to land on an asteroid			1
the @entity8 mission is n't planned to take place until the 2020s			2
that is n't stopping astronauts from simulating an asteroid landing in a 40 - foot - deep swimming pool at a @entity20 in @entity21			1
" we 're working on the techniques and tools we might use someday to explore a small asteroid that was captured from an orbit around the sun and brought back by a robotic spacecraft to orbit around the moon , " said @entity22 , one of the astronauts participating in the tests			1
testing tools " when it 's there , we can send people there to take samples and take a look at it up close , " he said			0
" that 's our main task ; we 're looking at tools we 'd use for that , how we 'd take those samples			0
" love and his colleague @entity44 , who between them have clocked up more than 62 hours on real spacewalks , took a dip in the swimming pool at @entity8 's @entity50 last week to practice climbing out of a mockup of the @entity54 spacecraft onto a fake asteroid			2
being underwater creates the lack of gravity that allows astronauts to practice walking in space			0
the two men were working with engineers to try out tools that might be used , like a pneumatic hammer , as well as the type of spacesuit that might be worn on the asteroid			0
searching for targets @entity8 says it 's already trying to pick out an asteroid that a robotic mission could reach , capture and bring into an orbit around the moon			1
astronauts would then travel on the @entity54 spacecraft to explore the asteroid and collect samples			2
material from the asteroid 's core could contain information about the age and formation of the solar system			1
the agency says the approach " makes good use of capabilities @entity8 already has , while also advancing a number of technologies needed for longer - term plans : sending humans to @entity92 in the 2030s			0
" astronomers find first asteroid with rings study : solar system full of ' rogue ' asteroids			1

@entity8 wants to land astronauts on an asteroid in the 2020s
its *strategy* is to capture an asteroid and put it in orbit around the moon
two astronauts have been simulating an asteroid landing at a space center
rock samples from an asteroid may garner information about the solar system
