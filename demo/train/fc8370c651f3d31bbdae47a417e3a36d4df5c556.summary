@entity0 -- when @entity3 came into the @entity5 office thursday hoping to renew the same sliding - scale health policy that he had last year , he got more than he bargained for			1
the 34 - year - old limo driver was met by not one health benefits expert but two			1
" i 'm going to sign you up for your sliding scale , and let me introduce you to someone else who will help , " said @entity9 , the health benefits adviser at @entity5			1
she is going to talk to you about what else might be possible			2
" in august of this year , the @entity17 gave out $ 67 million in @entity18			1
the grants pay to train , support and certify advisers , also known as patient navigators , who work out in the field and on the phone			1
the navigators partner with local medical systems to help people figure out how the new @entity29 health insurance marketplaces work			1
@entity30 offers funding to help communities understand @entity29 most people who will become newly insured through @entity29 have no experience buying health insurance			1
navigators ca n't tell people what plan to pick , but they can walk people through what might work best based on their family circumstances and health			1
based on his income , @entity3 may qualify for a subsidized health plan through the new @entity29 marketplaces			1
" that 's wonderful , " he said			2
let me show you something			2
" he took out his smartphone and showed @entity51 his browser			2
it was stuck on the website for @entity56 's health insurance marketplace			1
" see , it says i 'm almost in , " he said			0
this week the sheer volume of interest overwhelmed the @entity56 site			0
all across the country there were reports of long wait times at other state and federal sites			0
he seemed excited about the possibility of buying his own policy , and @entity51 is someone who can help			0
@entity51 is the official navigator team leader for the nonprofit @entity69			0
@entity69 will get about 300 certified navigators who will be essential during open enrollment			1
a @entity74 poll in march found that 67 % of the uninsured under the age of 65 -- the people who could most benefit from @entity29 -- said they did n't understand how it could affect them			1
@entity9 met @entity51 for the first time thursday			0
dressed head to toe in bright pink for @entity84 , @entity9 literally did a small dance of joy when she learned a navigator was in the building			0
" i 'm so glad you are here , " @entity9 said			0
" people ca n't sign up fast enough for this , and they do need help			1
" " answer ' yes ' to one of these , " @entity51 told @entity3 as he filled out forms			0
@entity51 's calm demeanor and reassuring tone visibly seemed to put @entity3 at ease			0
@entity51 used to be a teacher			0
she misses her special needs students , but finds this navigator work fulfilling			0
" it 's helping people who are willing to learn , and it 's helping people who are in dire need of health care , " @entity51 said			1
" with this program it will definitely give them a peace of mind			0
" @entity29 's coverage gap : the poor caught in between here in @entity56 , the state has fully embraced @entity29			1
it opened its own marketplace and expanded @entity118			0
about 13 % of the population in @entity56 does n't have any kind of insurance , according to the @entity122			1
that means nearly 750,000 people are probably not getting all the medical attention they need			1
about half that population is now eligible for @entity118 with the state 's expansion			0
in addition to navigators like @entity51 , @entity129 also set up a call center			1
it 's staffed seven days a week with people who can take calls in 200 different languages			2
@entity51 says it 's gotten a ton of calls this week			0
only a few were angry ( some people call not for help , but to vent about @entity29 )			1
" mostly , the angry callers just want to be heard , " @entity51 says			0
" so , we listen to those too			0
" most of the questions the navigators get involve the cost			2
with subsidies , the @entity149 estimates the majority of people should be able to find coverage for $ 100 or less a month			1
even a bare - bones policy covers preventive care like immunizations , mental health , rehab and other services			2
her navigator job , @entity51 says , also has a side benefit			0
her friends now call all the time			0
" even though they have jobs , some of them still do n't have insurance , " @entity51 said			1
" a lot of my friends are calling me and saying ' ok , where do i need to go ? what do i need to do ? can i come to your house ? ' we are at a place in life where you have a job , but you ca n't afford to buy a health plan			1
i think this is going to be a really good thing because now it 's going to be really affordable to people			2
" toward the end of his visit , @entity3 's smartphone still had n't connected with the @entity56 marketplace			2
he has n't signed up for a new plan yet , but he does have more information			2
he has until december 14 to sign up if he wants his family to have coverage starting january 1			2
for many , signing up for a new policy may take several conversations or several website visits			0
" i know there 's some general frustration right now with the online part , " @entity51 said			0
" i 'm confident though we 'll work the kinks out , and regardless , i know they will be happy once they get all the benefits			0
it can be life - changing			0
