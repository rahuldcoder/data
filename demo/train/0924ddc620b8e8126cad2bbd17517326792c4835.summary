almost 70 years after the liberation of @entity2 , the concentration camp set up by the @entity4 to exterminate @entity6 prisoners , there are still a handful of @entity8 who continue to receive @entity12 @entity11 benefits			1
the @entity13 unanimously passed a bill -- dubbed the " no @entity11 for @entity15 " -- on tuesday that would cut off those benefits			2
@entity18 @entity17 rep. @entity17 , a decorated @entity19 veteran who was a prisoner of war for seven years during the @entity21 , was the lead sponsor of the legislation			0
" while the number of nazis receiving @entity11 is few , allowing payments to continue is an insult to those who suffered at the hands of the @entity8 , " @entity17 said			1
@entity30 has considered various proposals designed to deny any benefits from @entity8			1
this latest bill was introduced last month after a recent @entity35 investigation reported that dozens of @entity8 who were deported from the @entity12 were still collecting millions of dollars in retirement benefits			1
even though these people were stripped of their @entity12 citizenship and forced to leave the country a loophole in the law allowed them to continue receiving @entity11 checks			2
@entity46 rep. @entity45 of @entity47 , who has been a key proponent in changing the law , told @entity49 that she has asked both the @entity50 and @entity51 to find out how much money was paid out and how many were still receiving any social security funds			1
she estimated there were roughly four individuals who were still eligible for the payments			0
" they are dying out , but anybody who gets it is too much			0
they came to this country under false pretenses , " @entity59 told @entity49			0
suspected @entity64 war criminal dies hours before court approves extradition there is a companion bill in the @entity69 and the sponsors of the @entity13 bill are confident that this is one item that both parties in the @entity13 and @entity69 can get to the president 's desk before the lame duck session of wraps up this month			0
" if we ca n't agree on this , my goodness what can we agree on ? " @entity59 asked .			0
