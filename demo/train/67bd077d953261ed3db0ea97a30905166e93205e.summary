@entity0 -- for @entity4 's latest version of its office suite , the company is betting big that making documents accessible across multiple devices , a cleaned - up design and improved collaboration features will keep the product relevant to today 's users			1
@entity4 announced the @entity13 8 - friendly products , @entity14 and @entity15 , at a press event on monday			1
it 's a major overhaul meant to help it fight a shrinking pc market , free web - based competitors and consumer influence in corporate it departments			1
" in a sense , it feels to us a lot like 1995 , " said an excited @entity23 , @entity4 ceo , at the event			2
the nostalgia might be for the year @entity30 made its public debut , but the much - repeated theme of the new version of @entity14 is that it 's the " modern @entity14			1
" @entity14 reigns as @entity4 's most lucrative product and maintains a 90 % market share of pcs , according to research firm @entity37			1
but recent years have seen a slew of inexpensive and free competitors nipping at its heels -- most notably @entity42 , a cloud - based suite of software for word processing , spreadsheets , presentations and e-mail			2
the @entity50 tools lack some of the features found in @entity52 , but to many users that simplicity is part of their appeal			0
" keeping the market is always a challenge , especially when you 're competing against free or cheap , but @entity4 has been competing against cheaper and free suites for more than a decade and continues to do pretty well , " said @entity37 analyst @entity60			2
@entity4 is still taking @entity50 's encroachment seriously and has even created a special " @entity66 " team to prevent corporate office users from making the jump to @entity42 , according to @entity67			1
in addition to preventing users from switching to other products , @entity4 must persuade them to upgrade from older versions of @entity14			1
in the past , a confusing design change or dropped support for plug - ins has been reason enough for users to skip the upgrade and stick with the version they 're comfortable with			0
turnaround time can also be slow at large companies , where upgrading everyone is a costly and complicated undertaking			0
" organizations are still deploying @entity84 and @entity85 , and because of the urgency in getting @entity87 out by april 2014 when support ends , both @entity88 and @entity89 will likely have to take a back seat for a while , " said @entity60			0
while large corporations are slow to roll out new versions of software , there has been a recent shift in how they adopt technology			0
more and more , consumer technology is coming in the front door of businesses , being championed by the people who have to use it rather than the it department			0
a bring - your - own - device trend was started by executives unwilling to leave their beloved iphones at home , forcing companies to adapt quickly			0
the proliferation of free @entity50 e-mail accounts led to casual users switching to @entity115 , and eventually pushing their employers to switch to @entity42			0
most of monday 's office demonstration was done on touchscreen devices -- a tablet as well as a massive 82 - inch multitouch hd display connected to a @entity13 8 pc			1
expanding @entity14 to tablets might be necessary for @entity125 pc market has been struggling , with shipments of the desktop and laptop computers falling .1 % worldwide this past quarter compared to the same period last year			1
the smartphones and tablets are second and third devices , but users want to be able to work effectively from all of them and that requires cloud - based software			2
so for the time being , @entity14 must straddle two worlds so as not to lose customers			2
" you can still buy software and install it , " said @entity23			0
" that 's not going away , at least certainly not at this stage in the game			0

@entity4 announces its @entity13 8 - friendly products , @entity14 and @entity15
@entity14 reigns as @entity4 's most lucrative product with 90 % market share of pcs
expanding office to tablets may be necessary for *growth*
