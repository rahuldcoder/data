a well - known medical marijuana researcher at the @entity1 says a study she 's been planning for four years has cost her her job			1
dr. @entity4 , a clinical assistant professor in the college of medicine , has been with the university for nearly eight years in several capacities			1
she has been planning a pioneering study on marijuana 's effect on veterans with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder , or @entity14			1
" i was on the forefront of the most controversial research happening at the university , " said @entity4 , the study 's principal investigator , said			1
" and they did not like the optics of veterans smoking and vaporizing marijuana on their campus , even in the context of a rigorous , @entity25 - approved , randomized controlled trial			1
" that trial was designed to look at the safety and efficacy of using marijuana to treat veterans who suffer from ptsd and are n't responding to other approved treatments			2
seventy veterans were to participate in the randomized , triple - blind study , in which five different potencies would be used ; some would be placebos and others would contain doses of up to 12 % tetrahydrocannabinol , or @entity38 , the psychoactive ingredient in pot. for decades , studies to determine the medical benefits of cannabis have been few and far between because the @entity44 classifies it as a @entity46 -- the most dangerous class of drugs			1
that puts it in the same category as heroin , lsd and ecstasy			0
schedule i drugs are defined by the agency as " drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse			0
" last year , a search of the @entity61 revealed 2,000 recent papers on marijuana			0
but the majority explored the harm of marijuana ; only 6 % investigated the benefits			2
it 's yet another reason , @entity4 says , that this research is important for veterans all over the world			1
" all the countries that have vets suffering with @entity14 are looking for new treatment options , so the eyes of the world have been on this study for years now and have propelled it forward			2
" @entity4 , a psychiatrist , has been working with vets with @entity14 for 15 years			1
she claims that even with the various government approvals of the study , dating back three years , it was all contingent on the university providing a study location -- something she says they failed to do			0
then last month @entity4 says she received notice that her three contracts would not be renewed and she feels politics is behind the move			1
@entity4 said : " they wo n't give us a reason and they certainly do n't want to admit it 's political			2
" she also said her job evaluations and performance have been excellent , adding : " job performance is not the issue here			0
it 's about the university being fearful of the word ' marijuana ' and not wanting their brand aligned with this research			2
" but now the university is talking about it			0
while they will not discuss @entity107 specifically , @entity105 , a university spokesman , told @entity108 thursday that several employees , who were not involved in marijuana research , also received non-renewal notices			1
in a statement they say , " the @entity1 does not comment on personnel issues			2
in regard to marijuana research , in general , in 2013 , the @entity1 championed state legislation to ensure that universities could perform medical marijuana research on campus ... the @entity1 has not received political pressure to terminate any employee as has been suggested in some media and other reports			1
" in fact , @entity105 says , the university is committed to the study and has reached out to the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) , which is funding the study			0
" we have been in contact with @entity128 , assured them that we want to continue the research and will forward the candidate for the principal investigator			0
" but @entity128 is standing by @entity107 : " we told them that we are glad they are interested in the research , but we have n't agreed to do it with them , " said @entity136 , founder and executive director of @entity128			2
" our goal is still to get dr. @entity4 back her job and we will continue to support her in that			1
" right now , they are still working with her			0
" we 'll be supporting her and her lawyers ' efforts to submit an appeal for her reinstatement at the university , " @entity150 , @entity128 ' communications and marketing director , added			0
" we expect to receive that proposal for the principal investigator candidate from the @entity1 , but we are going to continue focusing on dr. @entity4 's appeal to the university			1
" in the meantime , @entity4 , who hopes to get her job back , has hired a lawyer			0
politics dealt the research a blow in april			0
state sen. @entity165 , who chairs the @entity166 , singlehandedly blocked a bill that would allow the use of surplus state funds toward the study -- and others on the beneficial effects of medical marijuana -- by refusing to allow a hearing for the @entity176 - passed bill			1
@entity165 would not discuss @entity107 's dismissal but said in a statement to @entity108 : " this $ 9 million of state money could otherwise be used for much needed k - 12 education programs and drug abuse prevention			1
there was significant opposition from the @entity185 county prosecutors and veteran - led drug prevention groups			0
i could not in good faith hear the bill in committee when it came to the @entity166			0
" @entity4 says veterans deserve this research and she will not give up			1
" we will somehow persevere and find a home for this work			0
so if it 's not at @entity1 it will be somewhere			2
we are negotiating with several other universities			0
" on wednesday , @entity197 , the director of @entity185 's @entity198 , wrote on his official " director 's blog " that he authorized " the use of marijuana ( under @entity203 ) for patients that are currently undergoing conventional treatment for a diagnosis of @entity14			1
" however , he says , marijuana could only be used for palliative care of ptsd symptoms , not for the treatment of the disorder			0
@entity212 : pot is legal and sky has n't fallen @entity215 : @entity217 's troubles with pot is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol ?			0
