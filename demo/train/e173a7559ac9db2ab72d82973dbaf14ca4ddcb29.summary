-- in the movie " @entity4 , " a young man rejects society and disappears			1
now , @entity6 's father fears his teenage son has done the same thing			1
@entity9 of @entity10 , @entity11 , has n't seen his 18 - year - old son in more than a week			1
@entity6 's green @entity13 was found abandoned on a lonely road in the quiet country town of @entity16 , @entity17 , on wednesday , two days after he was supposed to start college at @entity20			1
he was last seen at a friend 's home in @entity23 , where he 'd been visiting			2
his father assumed he was driving back to @entity11 through @entity25 and @entity17			1
" he 's never been in the wild before , " @entity9 said			1
but he says his son has been reading @entity29 's 1996 nonfiction book and watching the movie adaptation			2
@entity29 's account of the life of @entity33 has taken on an almost cult status among countless free spirits who dream of shedding the trappings of modern life and living off the land			1
" there were similarities , " @entity6 said of his son 's disappearance			1
@entity33 " left all his stuff in the car and took off			0
the problem with that movie is , he does n't make it			0
it 's a fatal end to the story			2
" in the book , @entity33 cut off communication with his parents and traveled to @entity54 , where he lived in a school bus before dying of starvation			0
like @entity33 , @entity6 is apparently traveling with very few belongings : perhaps a small backpack and his phone , his father says			1
left behind in the @entity13 was the teen 's id card , plus a sweatshirt , blanket and jug of water -- things someone might need to survive in the wilderness			1
" it 's not against the law for an adult man to decide he wants to get lost or take off , " said @entity69 , public information officer for the @entity70			1
" we have nothing to suggest this is foul play , nothing to suggest he is in danger			1
we do have people down today doing some searches			0
i do n't want to mislead you and suggest there is some massive search going on , because there is not			2
" the teen has been a main topic of conversation in @entity16 , a logging and ranching community of about 1,300 with no traditional grocery store and no movie theater			2
people are searching their property , says one resident , a longtime rancher who asked that he not be identified			0
" there 's nothing that makes sense			2
" @entity16 is dozens of miles from the nearest wilderness area , residents say			0
" it 's 2Â½ miles from the major interstate ; it 's right in town in @entity16 , " @entity102 said of where @entity6 's car was found			1
" there are houses and people , and it 's well - populated , so if he wanted to do an ' @entity4 , ' it was n't the appropriate place			1
" if he is in the wild , living off the land might be possible			1
overnight low temperatures are in the 50s , and there would be some food and water supply , residents say			0
" there 's berries and lots of places to get water , " said @entity123 , who sells fishing , camping and hunting supplies at @entity126 in nearby @entity127			2
" yeah , you could survive			0
" @entity6 's camping experience is limited at best , his father says , not much more than camping once or twice with his car			1
" i need to hear your voice " : that was the content of a text message @entity6 sent to his son on last week when he " started to feel funny " about not hearing from @entity6			1
" we got a text back from his friend ( in @entity23 ) saying , ' he left , and i ca n't get a hold of him			0
' " during the past six months , @entity6 's interest in the movie seems to have grown , says his father			1
" he 's been watching the movie a lot , " he said			2
" maybe he said , ' i want to do it			0
' that 's our theory , because he kept talking about the movie			2
" several reports describing travelers with an apparent interest in @entity33 and the abandoned " @entity159 " parked near @entity160 , @entity54 , outside @entity161 have surfaced recently			2
in may , a police helicopter reportedly rescued three @entity164 men who had hiked into the wilderness looking for the bus			0
an @entity168 teen inspired by the movie reportedly went missing in @entity17 in march after telling his parents he wanted to " live in the wild			1
" in 2010 , a @entity173 woman reportedly drowned in an @entity54 river during her trek to visit the famous bus			0
now joining searchers on foot and driving up logging roads in and around @entity16 , @entity9 hopes @entity33 ' story may hold some answers			0
" one of the keys to that movie is that no one ever went looking for him			0
we are trying to change the story by injecting ourselves in it and going to find him			0
he ca n't be too far away at this point			0
" police cautioned that nobody may know the reason @entity6 disappeared			1
" the ' into the @entity195 ' came from his dad , " @entity69 said			0
" i think his dad has that information , and i do n't know , again , if that 's what he wanted to do , he kind of picked the wrong place			2
" there are plenty of wilderness areas in @entity204 , but not where he 's at			2
" teams looking for the teen have tried using dogs " but could n't get a scent , " his father said			1
" i got a phone call from a logger who said he saw a young man with the same grin as my son on one of the logging roads , so a bunch of local volunteers are going to blanket the area			0
" but help is scarce in the small town			1
@entity9 has appealed to local search organizations for assistance			0
" they are doing the best they can , every drop of sweat , every footstep , i just wish we can do more , " he said			0
" @entity231 is ticking away			0
it 's already been a week			0
" my son is a kid , two states away , out in the wild with shorts and a t - shirt			0
