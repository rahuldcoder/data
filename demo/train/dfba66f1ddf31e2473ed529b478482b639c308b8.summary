@entity0 , @entity1 -- after i became a father , i found covering the stories of refugees more heart - wrenching than ever before			2
of course , it is the children that immediately draw your attention			1
it is their wide - eyed fascination with everything you do			2
they want to touch my producer @entity18 's hair and play with the gadgets of my cameraman , @entity21			2
they exchange high fives , give the peace sign , and gamely practice their @entity25 on me			2
i try not to let my mind wander to the place that imagines what the lives of these sweet children will be like weeks or months from now			1
they are images nobody should ever see			2
people starve to death here			2
how to help @entity36 refugees for the past several days , i had been in refugee camps along the border between @entity36 and @entity1			1
over the past 12 years , i have covered wars , natural disasters and other tragedies as a medical reporter , which meant the very worst stories filtered down to me			2
i remember a child who lost both her legs after stepping on a land mine in @entity48			2
i remember a family standing in a decimated home in @entity51 , having lost all it owned			2
in @entity53 , @entity54 , i saw young children searching for their parents in large garbage dumpsters , hoping to catch a final glimpse of them			1
@entity59 was full of stories of families swept away by the floods that soaked one - fifth of the nation			2
some of the very worst stories are happening again			0
none of this is easy to write			0
i am here because i believe the few minutes you spend reading this firsthand dispatch will give you a clearer idea of what is unfolding here			0
while you may not be able to locate the @entity0 on a map , or even @entity75 for that matter , stories about health are universal and serve as a common denominator all over the planet			0
over the past two years , 720,000 registered refugees have made the dangerous crossing from @entity36 into @entity1			1
according to aid organizations on the ground , at least that many more have also come across illegally			0
in a country of 4 million people , roughly one in four is now a refugee			1
@entity1 is buckling under the weight of these refugees , leading to abysmal conditions			0
in the largest camp in @entity0 , there is no fixed water supply or sanitation			1
there are streams of putrid waste snaking their way through the camps			0
and there is not enough food			0
as a dad , you get pretty good at judging the age of children , based on their size			1
here , nothing makes sense			0
there are 8 - month - olds who look closer in age to newborns , and 10 - year - olds who look 5			1
and often , it is the young child forced to care for an even younger child			0
in a place like this , you can quickly distinguish the children who are being breast - fed from those who are not			1
while the breast - fed children are getting carbohydrates , fats and proteins , they are not getting enough calories overall			1
it is tough , after all , when the mother has not had anything to eat for days herself			0
the child 's hair looks dull , the skin looks thin and the body looks emaciated			0
it is called marasmus , and it should n't typically happen to a breast - fed baby			0
@entity36 's traumatized refugee children again , nothing here is typical			1
the older children who are able to obtain any sort of calories are not getting enough proteins in their diet			1
they eat primarily just grains			1
their small bodies look bloated and they often have swelling in their tiny feet			1
it also has a name : kwashiorkor			0
i learned much of this in medical school , and even then i prayed to never see it firsthand			0
sadly , i now know the look of eyes that have not seen food for too long			0
they can look at nothing else			0
it is not a hopeful look , but a sad resignation that despite their deep hunger , these morsels of basic food are not meant for them			0
if you are a parent or have any compassion whatsoever , seeing those eyes will bring you to your knees			0
@entity173 number of @entity36 refugees tops 2 million to simply live in a makeshift tent on a 10 - by - 10 - foot plot of dirt , some of the landowners in @entity0 are charging $ 100 a month			1
it would almost be laughable except as so often happens -- the children bear the brunt of this hardship			1
they work in the fields for $ 2 a day , beg under bridges and turn to prostitution			0
truth is , i feel guilty the moment i arrive , knowing i will leave and wave wildly at the tiny little friends running alongside our car -- as if that will somehow make things any better for them			1
these children will fill your daytime thoughts and your dreams at night			1
their minds are brimming with dreams unrealized and their hearts are so full of hope			0
i often think of my own children and how disappointed they would be that their daddy could n't do more to help kids like them			1
it would be missing the point to say that i see the eyes of my own children , when i look into the children 's eyes of @entity0			1
truth is , these are my children			1
they are the children of the world , many of them will persevere , and may even make it home to a hopefully more stable way of life			2
but , for the time being -- this is the price they pay as refugees in @entity1 , september 2013 .			0

*dr.* @entity226 has been at refugee camp outside of @entity36
the children are living in filth and look half their age , he says
their small bodies are bloated as they are living off grains , @entity226 says
" truth is , these are my children , " he says
