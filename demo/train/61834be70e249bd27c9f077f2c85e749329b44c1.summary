running for president takes @entity1 , literally			1
recalling his own campaign and debate experiences , @entity3 sympathized with @entity7 gubernatorial candidate @entity6 on tuesday , saying that he knows why the former governor insisted on using a fan during his debate in october			1
" you may have read that one of the candidates for governor of @entity7 this year put a fan under his podium when he debated , " @entity3 said			1
" i sure know why : debating can be sweaty business			0
" speaking to students at his alma mater -- @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 -- on tuesday , @entity3 said that debating on a national level is harder than it looks			1
" you may find it hard to imagine what it is like to debate an opponent on national tv			2
i was not a high school debater , " @entity3 said			2
" in fact , until i got into politics , the only person i had ever debated was my 5 - year - old son , @entity32 and he usually won			0
" " my 2012 campaign had 23 televised debates , 20 with fellow @entity37 and three with president @entity38			1
these guys were no debate slouches			0
@entity41 had been speaker of the house			0
and president @entity38 , well , he had been president for four years			0
he kind of had his facts nailed down by that point			0
" inspirational reminders to combat the stress , @entity3 developed a strategy to keep his nerves cool and his mind centered			1
" before every one of my debates , i did something to keep things in perspective , " @entity3 said			2
" at the top of the sheet of paper that was placed on my podium for me to make notes , just before the debate kicked off , i wrote at the top one word : ' @entity61			0
' i also drew a small image of the sun. " " throughout the debate , when i 'd glance down at that paper , i was reminded of my father 's fearlessness in fighting for what he believed was right			1
and the sun ? that reminded me of the familiar scripture , ' let your light so shine ... ' " win or lose a debate , i hoped i would never do anything that would dishonor or discredit the things i hold most dear			0
" one would assume that after two unsuccessful runs for the @entity79 -- with millions of dollars spent , hundreds of days on the road and lots of critical press -- @entity3 would feel deflated , overcome and disheartened			1
in fact , the former @entity84 governor says that running for president was " the most remarkable " of his life 's journeys			1
" despite my loss , the experience was extraordinary and revealing , " @entity3 said			2
" i come away more optimistic about the future of the country			0
" from @entity94 major to @entity79 candidate an @entity94 major , @entity3 said that growing up , he had no idea what he was going to do with his life , let alone run for president			1
" almost nothing i 've done in my career was planned in advance , " @entity3 said			2
" i could hardly have predicted i would get into politics			0
" of course , the notoriety that comes with running for the highest office in the @entity107 can be exhausting			0
and although " @entity3 " is now a household name , the former businessman does relish the time when that was n't always the case			1
" one evening in a @entity116 in @entity117 , i had arranged for a massage to loosen my tight back , " @entity3 said , recounting one of his favorite moments from the campaign trail			2
" believe it or not , the hundreds upon hundreds of handshakes that day had given me a backache			0
after the massage , the masseuse , obviously unaware of my political career , remarked to my assistant : ' mr. @entity3 has strong legs ; he is a dancer , is he not ? ' " " that may have been the best compliment of my campaign			1
