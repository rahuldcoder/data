@entity0 , @entity1 -- a man who dedicated his career to working in the prison system was gunned down in his @entity1 home , and investigators are on a nonstop hunt for his killer			1
" @entity11 was someone who worked in a cold , dark world with a remarkably open and generous heart , " said an emotional gov. @entity10			1
he appointed @entity11 in 2011 to lead @entity1 's prisons after @entity11 spent decades working to improve @entity16 's corrections system			1
@entity11 , 58 , answered the door at his @entity20 home tuesday night and was shot dead , the @entity17 said			1
monument is about 50 miles south of @entity22			0
@entity10 seemed broken up about @entity11 ' death as he spoke , and said he chose to go ahead with signing landmark gun control legislation the same day , as previously planned			1
the measures were pushed after 12 " @entity27 " moviegoers were shot to death last summer in @entity29 , @entity1			1
" and i think it 's a coincidence , but an incredibly tragic and sad coincidence , that we have to process this all in a single day , " the governor told @entity2 affiliate @entity31			2
but @entity10 said he was " all about carrying on			0
" @entity37 ' wife , @entity36 , urged the governor not to even think about delaying the signing			2
" he would have expected us to sign these bills and go forward today , " @entity10 said			0
" that 's just the kind of man he was			0
" the new legislation includes a 15 - round limit on magazines , universal background checks for prospective gun buyers and a requirement for gun purchasers to pay for their own background checks			2
it becomes effective july 1			0
asked about a possible motive , lt. @entity55 of the sheriff 's office said that authorities know that @entity11 ' position with the prison system " opens a dynamic " in the investigation , meaning that someone related to the prisons may have wanted to harm him			1
" because of the fact that mr. @entity11 served in the position that he did ... we 're sensitive to the fact that there could be any number of people who may have a motive for wanting to target him for a crime such as this			1
" however , we also remain open - minded to all of the other possibilities as well because we do n't want to follow one particular trail and find ourselves perhaps missing something along the way , " @entity55 said			0
reporters asked the governor whether @entity11 was " active " in his support for the new gun legislation , @entity10 replied : " he was supportive but he was n't particularly active			1
" the lieutenant told @entity2 that @entity11 had not received any threats that authorities were aware of			1
as news cameras trained on the governor while he signed each gun measure , investigators combed @entity11 ' neighborhood , talking to neighbors and searching for clues			1
one of those clues is a car that was seen near @entity11 ' home at about the same time a 911 call was made by a relative in @entity11 ' home telling authorities about the shooting			1
a resident noticed a late - 1990s model boxy vehicle , possibly a @entity101 , in the area , said @entity55 of the sheriff 's office			2
the resident told investigators that the car was about 200 yards from @entity11 ' house on @entity109 drive at about 8:30 p.m. and it was running but empty			1
the 911 call was made at 8:37 p.m. , @entity55 said			0
the resident told investigators that a few minutes after seeing the empty car , the resident saw the car again , but someone was inside and driving away			1
the car was headed in the direction of a road that leads to an interstate highway , @entity55 told @entity2			0
authorities said they are looking for a woman who may have information concerning that vehicle			2
she was described as a white female , between 35 - 50 years of age			0
she was wearing light pants , a dark windbreaker and a hat , and may have been speed walking on @entity11 ' street tuesday night			1
officials stressed she is not a suspect , but is just someone they want to speak to			0
they are not releasing the name of the relative who made the 911 call , but said the caller was the only other person home at the time			0
@entity55 added that it 's unclear whether that relative was in the same room as @entity11 or in another part of the house			2
wednesday morning , @entity10 ordered flags in the state lowered to half - staff between sunrise and sunset until after @entity11 ' funeral			2
arrangements are still being made			0
the governor repeatedly praised @entity11 wednesday afternoon , calling him a " dedicated , committed , funny , caring expert at corrections " who tried to ensure that prisoners had adequate support before their release			1
" in many ways , @entity11 helped define what a public servant is , " the governor said			1
" he did his job quietly and intently			0
" in addition to his wife , @entity11 leaves two daughters , @entity165 and @entity166 , the governor 's office said			1
@entity37 ' family released a statement through that office , thanking everyone for their support and concern			0
