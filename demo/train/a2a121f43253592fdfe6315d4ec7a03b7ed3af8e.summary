-- a spate of deadly shootings during anti-drug operations in @entity4 -- including two in which @entity6 agents killed suspects -- is linked to an aggressive new strategy to disrupt a preferred corridor for traffickers			1
@entity12 , as the multinational mission is known , differs from past efforts because of its reliance on military outposts close to the front lines to provide quick responses			1
it is a strategy reminiscent of counterinsurgency tactics used by the @entity6 military on battlefields in @entity23 and @entity24			2
in a two - month span , six people have been killed in the operation , including possibly four innocent civilians			1
despite the controversial shootings , @entity6 and @entity4 officials say they both are happy with their collaboration and consider @entity12 -- launched in april -- a success			1
as of wednesday , authorities said , they had interdicted five planes , seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine , and made seven arrests			0
firearms , including military assault rifles , have also been seized			0
" the amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves , " said @entity39 , the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity6			1
meanwhile , critics in @entity4 and the @entity6 oppose the law enforcement strategy and question why @entity6 agents are killing anyone on foreign soil during peacetime			1
the latest incident was just after midnight on july 3 , when a plane carrying 900 kilograms of cocaine crashed in northeast @entity4 -- not an uncommon occurrence in a region that is among traffickers ' preferred smuggling stopovers			1
authorities descended on the scene , and when one of the suspected traffickers aboard the plane allegedly made a threatening move , two @entity61 officers opened fire , agency spokeswoman @entity59 said			0
it was the second such incident in a two - week span			0
on june 23 , a @entity61 agent shot and killed a suspected trafficker after he reached for a weapon , the agency said			0
the pair of shootings by @entity61 agents follow an episode in may in which villagers in the country 's @entity82 coastal region say @entity4 forces aboard @entity6 helicopters mistakenly fired on a civilian riverboat , killing four , including two pregnant women			1
a @entity6 official with knowledge of the incident said that the preliminary @entity4 investigation , as well as a video of the incident , raises doubts about claims by those on the riverboat that they were innocent victims			1
the official asked not to be named because the a final report has not been issued			0
" i think this is a disheartening sign of the escalation of @entity6 involvement in @entity4 without clear goals and guidelines , " said @entity100 , a @entity4 expert and history professor at the @entity102			1
" there is no clear oversight from @entity110 over what is going on , " she said			0
" it 's not clear under what terms the @entity61 is there , operating in killings			0
" anti-narcotics cooperation between the @entity6 and @entity118 countries is not new , but @entity12 represents a new approach to intercepting smugglers ' aircraft			1
@entity123 film revolves around drug war @entity12 's major innovation is the use of military outposts closer to the drug trafficking routes , known as forward operating locations , for quicker deployment by @entity4 police and their @entity61 advisers			1
@entity12 appears modeled after counterinsurgency tactics used by the @entity6 in @entity24 and @entity23 , but the @entity4 say the suggestion to use the forward operating locations came from them			1
about 600 @entity6 troops are located in @entity4 , mostly at @entity137			1
officials say they have seen a decreased role in @entity12 as the @entity61 team has stepped up , but a limited number of @entity6 troops remain at the forward operating locations			1
@entity144 , as the @entity6 contingent is called , serves " purely as a support element , providing re-fueling capability , communications infrastructure and medical evacuation capability " at the forward bases , said lt. @entity151 , the spokesman for the group			2
the forward operating bases are owned and maintained by the @entity4 , and they have operated them for years , @entity151 said			2
the helicopters used in the operations belong to the @entity157 , and are piloted either by @entity159 military pilots who are on loan , or by @entity6 contractors , said @entity162 , spokesman for the @entity163 in @entity4			1
what 's not new is the teamwork between the @entity61 and vetted @entity4 police who participate in the operations , @entity162 said			2
" this concept is new , but previously there 's been these type of bi-national efforts done by the @entity4 government and @entity61 , " he said			2
@entity12 seeks to track planes entering @entity4 , ascertains where they will land , and then sends helicopters out to make arrests , @entity162 said			1
both governments insist that the @entity61 agents provide a supporting role only , and that under their rules of engagement are allowed to fire their weapons only in response to a threat			0
the @entity61 " is in @entity4 at the request of our government in a support and training capacity , " @entity186 said			2
the three shooting incidents are the part of @entity12 that has received the most attention , but law enforcement aid is just one of the facets of @entity6 help			1
@entity12 falls within the larger framework of @entity200 , or @entity201 , which has provided more than half a billion dollars to the region since 2008			2
besides law enforcement efforts , the money goes toward institution building and anti-corruption efforts , @entity162 said			0
nobelists focus on violence against women in @entity118 " it 's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone , " he said			0
the goal is to address security concerns through all means , he said			0
@entity6 funding for @entity201 has increased from $ 60 million in 2008 to an estimated $ 135 million in 2012			2
the most controversial of the @entity12 - related confrontations has been the may 11 incident near @entity219 in the @entity82 region			1
@entity221 , the owner of the boat that was attacked , told reporters last month that she was carrying passengers before dawn when helicopters appeared and opened fire , wounding her and killing four			0
the @entity157 , however , has indicated that the @entity4 forces were justified in firing in self - defense			1
@entity61 agents were present , but did not fire their weapons , officials say			0
the @entity4 government is investigating the incident , but critics do n't believe the government has the capacity to fairly assess itself			1
" what happened in @entity219 is unbelievable			0
they claim they combat crime but they cover up their own crime ? " said @entity239 , a @entity4 historian and former minister of culture , arts and sports			2
pastor is one of 40 @entity4 scholars , joined by 300 from outside the country , who signed a letter to president @entity253 and secretary of state @entity254 asking that the @entity6 cease all military and police aid until corrupt agencies are cleaned up			1
for the @entity6 , " the collateral damages are related to an equation that supposes that the high price paid to keep drugs from reaching its market is in some way beneficial and worth it			2
for us who gain no benefit , these costs are unacceptable , " @entity248 said			0
they wrote the letter , he said , because @entity4 are " fearful of the prospect of militarization without end			2
" @entity186 , the @entity4 ambassador , counters that @entity12 and other programs are not military operations , but law enforcement ones			1
" these are crime - fighting operations and , as such , entail serious risks for people involved in illicit activities and for the law enforcement agents on the field , " @entity186 said			0
" the @entity61 agents have followed their own rules of engagement and have used arms only when their lives have been threatened			0
any loss of life is regrettable ; the security authorities of @entity4 have repeatedly alerted the local population of the dangers they incur by participating in this criminal activity			0
" given the lack of control by @entity4 authorities in the northeastern part of the country , it was inevitable that the @entity6 would play a more direct role in combating drug trafficking there , said @entity301 , a professor of political science and criminal justice at @entity304 who has studied and worked in @entity4			1
drug cartels exert such influence in the region that both law enforcement and civilian government agencies have been corrupted , he said			0
the corruption is entrenched , with local police , aeronautic agencies , rural logging interests and indigenous groups infiltrated by the cartels			0
just as part of the counterinsurgency missions in @entity24 and @entity23 had an element of earning locals ' trust , the same is needed in @entity4 , @entity301 said			0
" it 's not just a matter of seizing planes and catching people in the act , but a matter of gaining trust and understanding how these organizations work , " he said			0
drug trafficking through this corridor is not likely to stop until there is an understanding of how deeply entrenched the drug trade is in local communities , he added but the @entity4 government is weak , its institutions and police suffer from corruption , and public opinion favors security on the streets more than security in remote parts of the country , @entity301 said			2
these factors are not favorable for long - term success , he said			0
@entity162 , the @entity6 embassy spokesman , said @entity12 has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations			1
" we believe these interdictions have had a strong impact , " he said			0
why the @entity6 ca n't afford to ignore @entity351 @entity0 's @entity352 contributed to this report .			0

six people have been killed in three incidents over the past two months in @entity4
the incidents happened during the course of @entity12 , a joint @entity4 - @entity6 effort
