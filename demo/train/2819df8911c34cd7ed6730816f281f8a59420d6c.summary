-- the major talking point at the @entity2 in @entity3 this summer was the extent to which experts had got their predictions wrong			0
in april , the @entity8 @entity7 forced the three largest online poker sites to close their doors to @entity8 customers , essentially imposing prohibition on one of the undisputed boom industries of the 21st century			1
the knock - on effect to poker 's flagship tournament series was expected to be profound , with player numbers predicted to plummet , perhaps by as much as 60 %			0
there was almost no change in attendance at all			0
despite an industry in turmoil there were still 6,865 players handing over $ 10,000 for their chance at a near $ 9m payday at the prestigious @entity3 tournament known as the " @entity30 "			1
these are the kind of numbers , and dizzying sums of money , to which poker players have grown accustomed over the past decade , when the game has undergone a sensational explosion in popularity			0
although its legality in the @entity8 has been uncertain since 2006 , a study in 2009 by @entity40 showed that 10 million @entity8 played online poker , and it had grown into a worldwide industry worth at least $ 2.5bn dollars a year in revenue			1
the game in the short term is a combination of skill and luck , but the keen financial acumen of the best exponents meant thousands of people played online poker professionally , making their living solely from the game			1
when the sites were closed to @entity8 in april , not only was the single largest market quarantined , cutting the operators ' profits , but many professional players essentially lost their jobs			1
analysts were fearing the worst			0
yet although players in the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) came from 85 countries , two thirds of the field was @entity8			1
it seemed the online prohibition had only enhanced the appetite for poker in the game 's traditional capital and the casino poker rooms were packed			2
the robust numbers , however , put a misleading gloss on an industry still mired in controversy			0
at the time the @entity7 closed the poker sites -- on what has become known as " @entity80 " -- poker operators ' bank accounts were frozen and millions of dollars of players ' funds were put out of their reach			1
the players -- both full time professionals and recreational dabblers -- were initially unsure when they would see their money again and although @entity90 , the largest site , immediately co-operated with the authorities and repaid more than $ 100m to its @entity8 former customers , neither @entity94 nor @entity95 , the two other indicted sites , have yet paid back a penny			1
rumors became increasingly voluble that the funds had been diverted into marketing and operational budgets , in contravention of rules governing online gambling sites			1
although @entity95 initially continued to operate outside the @entity8 , it had its licence suspended by the @entity107 in the @entity108 in late june and has not traded since			2
" the atmosphere ( at the @entity2 ) was definitely deflated , " said @entity109 , a poker industry executive and analyst			1
" the continuing fallout from the @entity95 situation -- notably the total silence from @entity95 as to when @entity8 players might expect to receive their money -- put a damper on the whole series			2
every week that went by , the @entity95 situation seemed to get worse and that in turn siphoned some of the pageantry out of the @entity2			0
" in previous years , early losers from @entity2 tournaments would simply fire up their laptops and replenish funds at the online tables			0
this year , the only option for poker enthusiasts was the grind of the " live " tables : plonking down a bundle of bills and dueling face - to - face			0
but the relative renaissance may not be sustainable			0
" live " poker is a far less convenient option than online play : the charges are higher than online ; it is only possible to play at one table at once ; and human dealers are much slower than their computerized counterparts , and expect tips			2
other overheads , including traveling expenses and hotel bills , also sap revenue from bankrolls			0
it is more trouble than it is worth for many former sofa - based online players			2
commentators have suggested that the high turnout in @entity3 this summer represented one last hurrah for some players , prepared to speculate in full their poker bankroll , which can no longer be parlayed online			2
" my prediction is that the steep drop everyone feared this year will become a reality in 2012 , " said @entity109			0
" @entity80 happened close enough to the start of the @entity2 , and @entity90 players were paid out fast enough , that players could take ' one last shot ' this year			0
" @entity90 , and other operators who have never courted the @entity8 market , continue to flourish internationally and some @entity169 - based players are relishing the absence of @entity8 from the online tables			1
" it 's actually a good thing from my point of view , " said @entity172 , 30 , a @entity174 online poker player			1
@entity8 players have got a good solid game but now the tournaments are filled with a lot more @entity169 players who are n't as good			2
" @entity172 also cautioned , however , that many " live " international poker tournaments might suffer from the @entity8 lockout			1
" if there 's not a booming budget in online poker , then the whole poker economy will struggle , " he said			1
legislation for online poker in the @entity8 seems likely in a couple of years , and will probably tempt the major casino chains to expand into cyberspace			1
indeed , there is plenty of gossip in poker circles that april 's indictments were specifically intended to clear the decks of @entity203 companies ahead of a concerted push for regulation			0
but poker at the moment remains a pastime best enjoyed by non-americans a point perhaps underlined by the cosmopolitan make up of the @entity30 final table			0
when the remaining nine players return to @entity3 in november to play in the grand final , representatives from the @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and the @entity174 will surround only three @entity8 , the fewest in the tournament 's 41 - year history .			0
