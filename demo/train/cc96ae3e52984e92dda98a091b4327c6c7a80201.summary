if you want to drive on @entity1 , you are going to need a very large sand pit to prepare			1
engineers for @entity4 in the @entity5 have done just that , building what they call a " @entity9 " just outside @entity10 at a cost of about Â£ 500,000 ( $ 832,000 )			2
it contains 300 tons of sand ( about 660,000 lbs ) , which has been matched to the color measured by @entity16 's rovers			0
even the light levels inside the facility have been adjusted to mimic those on the @entity1			2
the idea is to replicate some of the @entity1 environment so the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) can test a future rover they hope will autonomously navigate the surface			1
@entity22 is planning two missions as part of its @entity28 program to shed more light on whether @entity1 could ever have supported life and in preparation for a possible sample return in the 2020s			1
an orbiter and prototype lander is due to launch in january 2016 and a rover is planned to follow in 2018			1
scientists on the ground want the rover to be able to calculate its own safe route to an object and they say building the @entity9 will help them prepare			1
" it takes 20 minutes for a signal to reach @entity1 which is too slow for good control from the @entity44 , " said @entity42 , head of @entity44 observation and science at @entity4			2
" this way the rover can get itself out of trouble			0
" we are going to @entity1 to look for signs of life -- and this is an important step towards that goal , " he said			2
@entity4 says the @entity9 will be used up until launch but also kept available after the rover has landed in 2019 so that any potential problems can be simulated and solved back at the facility			1
the @entity62 agency 's return to @entity1 comes more than a decade after its last attempt to land			2
@entity22 's @entity64 is still in orbit around the @entity1 and has been sending back data for 10 years			1
it recently made a close flyby of the @entity69 with the aim of finding out more about its mass and interior structure			0
but its lander , @entity75 , which was intended to search for evidence of life on @entity1 , was lost on christmas day 2003 after it failed to make contact with the orbiter			0
exploring @entity1 is a tough challenge			0
many missions have failed since the earliest attempts at landing			0
a @entity85 probe made the first human impact when its lander crashed in 1971			0
but since then , a series of @entity16 rovers have provided a wealth of information about the hostile @entity1 environment			1
curiosity has been analyzing samples scooped from the soil and drilled from rocks since landing in 2012			0
and @entity97 has traveled abound 40km ( 24 miles ) and returned data from the @entity1 for more than a decade			0
two more spacecraft are currently en route to the planet			1
@entity103 's @entity102 and @entity16 's @entity105 orbiter are due to reach their target in september this year			0
