-- thousands of @entity2 women and children leave the poverty and the violence in their communities to embark on a 1,500 - mile journey through the heart of @entity10 cartel territory to get into the @entity11			1
on " @entity12 " -- the name given to the fast train that many ride through @entity10 -- the stories are harrowing			2
some die along the way			0
others reach the " land of the free ' " only to find themselves in immigration detention or shelters for unaccompanied children			1
their individual stories often go untold for privacy , safety and security reasons			0
the @entity28 reports a dramatic decrease in the number of unaccompanied minors and adults with children crossing the border recently , a situation more like what we saw prior to the influx this spring and summer			2
still , thousands are entering the country illegally each month			0
one woman has been adamant about getting the stories of these women and children first hand in the hopes of solving the problem			2
the first lady of @entity2 , @entity49 , leads a commission , created by @entity2 president @entity51 , to solve the unaccompanied child crisis			1
she has visited shelters in the @entity11 and @entity10 , asking women and children about their arduous journey and the conditions that prompted them to flee			1
in this q&a , translated from @entity59 and edited for clarity and brevity , she sheds light on an issue that is close to her home and to her heart			0
@entity0 : you have talked with many women and unaccompanied children who have been detained by @entity11 immigration authorities or repatriated to @entity2			1
what story resonates the most ? @entity72 : in my visits to several shelters and detention centers in @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity10 ... every story has been hard for me to hear			1
i have talked to mothers and children who chose to leave the country in search of opportunity in the @entity11 and have faced the risks of the migration route			1
i remember this particular case of a child who had spent 20 days kidnapped by " coyotes " because his dad had not finished paying them and stories of women who have been abused			0
in @entity10 , i knew the story of a woman who was sexually abused in front of her husband and after that , she was attacked physically			2
as you can imagine , she was in a very difficult psychological situation			0
@entity0 : why is it important for you to hear the stories of the women and the children in person ? @entity72 : for me , it is essential to be in the place where everything happens			1
in the @entity11 , i visited several detention centers			1
i had the opportunity to talk with officials from the @entity113 and got a chance to be at the point of crossing in the @entity116			0
in @entity10 , i was in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and the capital city			2
back in @entity2 , i received our citizens repatriated from @entity10 on the border of @entity124 and deported from the @entity11 as well			1
when one hears closely the experiences of these families , there is a bigger desire and commitment to support and help them during this difficult time			0
@entity0 : in what ways do you think the @entity11 handling of the influx of women and unaccompanied children could be improved ? @entity72 : for my husband , president @entity51 , it has always been important that each case should be viewed on an individual basis			1
every child , every woman and every family is a different story of life , and they are entitled to have their human rights respected and to have the option to have a judge defend their case and explain their situation and hope for asylum			0
each case is a different story			0
@entity0 : as a woman , mother and wife , what frustrates you the most about the violence that is forcing young women and children to flee @entity2 ? @entity72 : it is a combination of many feelings			1
from one side we recognize that there is violence in the country , and believe me , we are fighting hard to eradicate it			0
we also know there are a lot of missing job opportunities , but my husband and the government are focused on social issues to generate these opportunities of development in @entity2			2
also , there 's misinformation coming from the organized crime networks , where human traffickers are doing business with the pain of @entity2 families			2
they do n't care if they have to risk the lives of children in the process of smuggling them into the country			0
@entity0 : hundreds , if not thousands , of unaccompanied @entity2 children have been released to sponsors in the @entity11 and are being enrolled in @entity11 schools right now			1
what is your message to those @entity2 children who are now beginning a new , uncertain life in the @entity11 ? @entity72 : what worries me the most is what is happening with these more than 15,000 @entity212 children who have entered this way to the @entity11			1
and those who have already been released to their parents or a sponsor , i wonder if these kids are actually in school , if they receive medical attention and especially if they get psychological counseling for the trauma they experienced on this trip			0
i imagine them entering a country where they do n't know the language and in many cases these children do not even know their parents			0
sometimes they only know their voices on the telephone			0
i ask the government of the @entity11 to provide these children with all the assistance they really need .			2

first lady of @entity2 has visited shelters in @entity11 and @entity10
she says it is essential to " be in the place where everything happens "
@entity72 wants @entity11 to view unaccompanied children on case - by - case basis
