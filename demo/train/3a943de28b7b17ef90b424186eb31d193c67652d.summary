-- college football is in a real institutional identity crisis			1
the range of reactions to the @entity6 scandal , from @entity7 itself to the @entity9 to the @entity11 people , tells us that we do n't know what college football is or what it should be			1
mostly , it has reacted strongly and rightly , but it has not cleaned house			0
@entity19 , @entity20 and others are gone , but should @entity22 stay , and were there others on the @entity6 coaching staff who were aware of @entity27 's alleged actions ? and many other questions remain : why were n't police immediately involved ? how did this stay covered up for so long ? the @entity9 's response has been little better			1
@entity9 president @entity31 released a statement last week , saying , " the @entity9 will defer in the immediate term to law enforcement officials since this situation involved alleged crimes			2
... to be clear , civil and criminal law will always take precedence over association rules			0
" while perhaps technically correct , the victims , as well as the college football community , deserve more of a response than this			1
the @entity11 people are outraged , and rightfully so			0
it looks like the work of a monster ( who still says he is not guilty ) destroyed the lives of innocent children			0
he has forever tarnished the reputation of former and future @entity6 students , athletes and coaches			2
this is the worst scandal in the history of college football			1
for it not to receive the worst punishment would be unjust			0
the college football " death penalty " ( the @entity9 's punishment that bans a school from participating in a sport for at least a year ) has been given to only one football program , ever : @entity66 in the 1987 - 88 season for numerous @entity9 violations involving paying athletes under the table			1
@entity66 's actions pale in comparison with what occurred at @entity6			2
but under @entity9 rules , the criminal actions of a few men are not necessarily @entity9 rules violations			0
the @entity9 decides where criminal laws overlap with its rules			0
and so , from a legal standpoint , it 's possible that the @entity6 football program will escape with less of a punishment than @entity66			1
how the @entity9 answers these questions may affect the future of college football			1
as is the case with so many recent college sports scandals , the events at @entity6 call into question the effects of big money on the inside workings of college sports			2
@entity6 football is a business -- an enormously profitable one , raking in more than $ 70 million a year			2
@entity19 's salary alone was about $ 1 million annually			0
@entity6 profits immensely from the success of its football program on the backs of unpaid amateur athletes			2
in many of these scandals , the players , often innocent and unprotected , are hurt the most , while the insulated , tight - lipped higher - ups of college boards and athletic programs fall back on their salaries and pensions			0
i say this as a longtime fan and admirer of college football , not an opportunistic critic			1
there are many big - money programs that are scandal free , like the @entity119 , the largest college football revenue generator in the country			1
many big programs can navigate ethically because of their moral compasses			0
similarly , many coaches and players never have ethical issues , and they should be applauded			0
but i 'm concerned about where the sport is headed			0
if college football is truly the amateur athletics wing of educational institutions , then these multimillion - dollar programs should be transparent and accountable			1
a student 's athletic performance should be tied to his academic achievement ; tighter age and eligibility restrictions should be implemented			0
in another fitting example , @entity140 quarterback @entity139 recently chose to play this saturday in the @entity140 game rather than attend his @entity144 scholarship interview , which happens to fall on the same day			0
@entity139 is free to choose of his liking , but he will forfeit the chance to win a @entity144 scholarship this year			0
the @entity9 has remained silent about this , a clear opportunity to support or help a real student - athlete			0
or college football can go the other way			1
if the @entity9 manages college football like a professional , for - profit enterprise , the players should be treated likewise			1
while revenues to college football have skyrocketed , benefits to players have not			1
players ca n't work jobs outside of football , but their school can sell their jersey for profits that they never see			0
should these players accept gifts or contributions , the penalties can be more severe than what the @entity9 could level on @entity6			1
perhaps it 's time for an open and honest debate about giving stipends , living expenses and even salaries to college football players			1
incentives could be in place that encourage players to follow @entity9 guidelines while rewarding them for their performance			2
the @entity9 's shortcomings are not to blame for the alleged actions of @entity27			2
however , the @entity9 system sometimes fosters closed - door , insulated , big - money administrations whose best interest is at times to sweep scandals under the rug and protect its own			0
it 's time for change			1
college football should decide what it really is			2
is it an amateur undertaking , subordinate to and supportive of education ? or is it a farm system for the professional leagues ? maybe it 's time it made up its mind			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			0

@entity208 : the @entity9 is adopting a low profile in @entity6 scandal
he says @entity6 is the most serious scandal *confronted* by college football
the @entity9 must take the lead in putting *safeguards* in place and in punishment , he says
@entity206 : it 's time for the @entity9 to make up its mind about priorities in college football
