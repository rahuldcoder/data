@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 and @entity1 signed a landmark deal sunday that affords @entity1 authorities an effective veto over controversial special operations raids			1
a bid to end visceral @entity1 anger over raids on private residences , the deal prevents @entity14 's @entity13 ( @entity13 ) from conducting such operations without the explicit permission of @entity1 officials , said a senior @entity14 official			1
it was not clear , however , whether the deal ceded 100 % of @entity3 capabilities over special forces operations , @entity13 's key tactic against the insurgency			1
from now on , an @entity1 review group will have to authorize an operation before it goes ahead , the official said			2
and special operations forces will operate under @entity1 law , said a statement from the presidential palace			1
@entity1 defense minister @entity31 and @entity13 commander gen. @entity32 signed the agreement at the @entity1 foreign ministry sunday afternoon			2
" the @entity1 special operations unit has developed at extraordinary speed " and is " manned by courageous and capable operators , " @entity32 said at the ceremony			1
" today we are on an important step closer to our shared goal of a secure and sovereign @entity1			2
together we will realize this vision			0
" @entity3 ambassador @entity43 said the agreement was an " important illustration " of partnership			0
" we are making sure this transition is not abrupt , but a path marked by benchmarks and steps that build @entity1 capacity , " @entity43 said in a statement			0
" this ( agreement ) marks another major step towards our goal of ensuring a stable , secure and sovereign @entity1 and of forging an enduring partnership with the government and people of @entity1			0
" the key deal comes after months of recriminations against special operations raids , particularly at night , that deeply offend @entity1 , as they involve foreigners entering their homes			1
@entity3 officials say the raids are vital to @entity14 's operation against insurgents			1
the complex system will fully " @entity70 " the operations , putting @entity1 commandos in the lead and giving @entity3 special forces a " training and support role , " a senior @entity1 official said			1
the official said the deal mandates a committee of @entity1 officials with @entity3 input , known as the @entity82 , to review @entity3 intelligence on a target before a raid			1
if that target is approved , that will constitute authority for the operation under @entity1 law , the official said			0
@entity1 officials have insisted the raids be conducted in compliance with @entity1 law			1
a senior @entity1 official with sight of the agreement said the search of " residential houses or private compounds " can now only be conducted by @entity1 special forces			2
@entity3 special forces will be on the ground in all special operations , but they will not enter the home of an @entity1 unless specifically asked to do so by the @entity1 commandos leading the operation , or by other @entity1 officials , the senior @entity14 official added			1
in the year since february 2011 , 22 % of special operations had occurred at night , the @entity14 official said			1
the @entity1 official said a new bilateral group will also be established , led by @entity31 , the defense minister , and @entity14 's @entity32			0
it will have oversight over the " afghanization of special operations " and resolve any disputes			1
a @entity3 military officer involved in the negotiations declined to discuss whether @entity3 would still carry out any special operations unilaterally , without @entity1 approval			1
last week , the @entity121 said 97 % of night raids were joint between @entity1 and @entity3 , special forces , leaving open the possibility that some were just performed by @entity3 commandos			1
@entity127 spokesman @entity126 told @entity2 sunday that the 97 % figure was accurate			0
he said the remaining 3 % referred to cases when @entity3 forces acquire intelligence on foreigners like @entity134 members or other senior foreign militants that " need special and quick reaction			2
" the @entity138 administration has previously stated that the @entity3 will go after key @entity134 targets and militants , regardless of where they are			0
talks have been going on for weeks on this key memorandum of understanding to address what is perhaps the most difficult issue in the partnership between @entity0 and @entity149			0
the agreement removes one of the obstacles in the way of a highly symbolic @entity154 , outlining the basis for @entity3 - @entity1 cooperation for the years after @entity14 's 2014 drawdown			1
night raids also present a particular challenge to @entity1 president @entity160			2
their strong unpopularity has forced the president to demand they stop , or at least no longer involve foreign troops , despite their operational significance to @entity14			0
@entity32 told @entity166 last month how vital and frequent those raids are			0
in 2011 , 83 % of the raids succeeded in detaining or striking either their primary target or an associated insurgent , he said			0
" this last year , we had about 2,200 night operations , " @entity32 told the @entity172			0
" of those 2,200 or so night operations , on 90 % of them we did n't fire a shot			0
on more than 50 % of them we got the targeted individual , and ( in ) 30 % more we got the next associate of that individual as well			0
" as for civilian casualties , in the 10 % of the night raids where shots were fired , " less than 1.5 % civilian casualties " resulted , @entity32 said			0
@entity160 has said @entity1 's homes and villages need to be safe and protected			2
" what we are asking for , in very specific and clear terms , ( is that ) no foreign forces should enter @entity1 homes , " he said last year .			2

new : a @entity3 officer declined to say whether @entity3 would still carry out any special operations unilaterally
@entity195 : the deal gives @entity1 effective veto power over raids
it also puts @entity1 commandos in the lead
raids into homes are deeply unpopular among @entity1 but the @entity3 says they are vital
