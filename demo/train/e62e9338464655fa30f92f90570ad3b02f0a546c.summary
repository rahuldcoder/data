-- in a country with a flourishing porn industry and an annual penis festival , it may come as a surprise that an artist with a mission to make female genitalia " more casual and pop " has run afoul of authorities			1
but in @entity14 , a conceptual artist known for creating works inspired by her genitals is being held by @entity16 police on charges of sharing obscene material electronically			1
@entity19 , who goes by the pseudonym @entity21 ( which means " good - for - nothing kid " ) , launched a crowd - funding campaign to raise money to build a kayak in the shape of her vagina using a @entity29 printer			1
in exchange for donations , supporters of the project were given data that would allow them to make their own @entity29 prints of her genitals			0
police arrested @entity19 saturday , charging her with " distributing data that could create an obscene shape through a 3 - d printer			1
" the 42 - year - old denies the charges , saying that she does n't acknowledge that the work is " an obscenity			1
" for her , it 's a piece of fine art. in fact , @entity19 came up with the the idea for the project based on her own self doubt			1
female genitalia is such a taboo in @entity14 society , she explained on her fundraising page , that it has become " overly hidden			1
" she did not know what a vagina " should look like , " she said , and worried that her own was " abnormal			0
" images of penises , on the other hand , were an acceptable part of pop culture , she said			0
( and anyone who 's witnessed crowds licking phallic lollipops and sporting penis - shaped glasses at @entity14 's " @entity69 " will find it difficult to argue with her			2
) the artist has embarked on a whole series of cutesy works inspired by the female anatomy , from smartphone cases to a giant kawaii mascot			1
she created miniature dioramas , including one of workers toiling away in a vagina - shaped crevice at @entity83 's damaged nuclear plant			0
many critics of her arrest have pointed out that @entity14 only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago , and even then , the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons			2
distributing uncensored images of real genitalia is a crime under the country 's obscenity laws			2
more than 17,000 people had signed an online petition calling for @entity19 's release as of wednesday			2
one of her lawyers , @entity100 , acknowledges that not everyone will appreciate @entity19 's work , but says that her case is about more than artistic expression			1
" whether you experience empathy with her works that challenge a taboo will depend on the individual 's sensitivity			0
however , all people who believe in freedom and equality of human beings should understand that her arrest and detention was not right thing			0
" police are still questioning @entity19 , a spokesperson for the @entity118 told @entity0 wednesday			0
the earliest the artist can be released is august 8 , although police can hold her for up to 20 days in order to gather evidence because she denies the charges , the spokesperson said			0
if convicted , she could face up to two years jail time or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen ( around us $ 24,500 ) , her lawyers say			0
@entity125 to deport @entity128 ' pork ' artist @entity0 's @entity129 and @entity130 reported from @entity16 ; @entity131 reported and wrote from @entity132 .			0
