-- @entity2 cars are a marvel of modern engineering , so much so , that many manufactuers who compete in the sport do so in order to benefit from the technical innovations race - honed research and development creates			2
car builders such as @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 have used technology -- developed to make single - seater race cars as competitive as possible -- to enhance their road - car products			0
and who can blame them if you consider the performance such a machine can deliver to a driver ? the average @entity2 car can reach 160km/h in under six seconds according to the official @entity2 web site and have top speeds in the region of 370 km / h. going fast is one thing , stopping is another , and controlling such velocity requires carbon brakes which , in any given race , will have an operating temperature that is over 600 degrees @entity38			1
in general , the cars weigh around 600 kilograms in race trim , including the addition of kers that some constructors use to increase performance			1
this system stores energy normally lost through braking and reuses it for speed boosts during the race			0
watch out for @entity42 powered cars -- including the @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity13 -- using their boost as the lights go green to start this weekend 's @entity55 .			0
