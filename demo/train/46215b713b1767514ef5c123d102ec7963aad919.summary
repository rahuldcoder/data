-- every day , @entity1 gives job seekers with a not - so - great job history , a gap on their résumé or even a criminal record , a second chance			1
how does he do it ? he fabricates job references to cover up their sordid pasts			1
@entity1 is the founder of @entity12 , a web site that says it will fill any gap on your résumé by acting as your past employer			1
it will go as far as creating a new company with an accompanying phone number , logo , web site and @entity24 profile			1
he says the site is designed to " help our subscribers meet the needs of the modern day job market			2
" " many of our subscribers tell me how a bad reference from a previous employer is akin to having a criminal record and is preventing them from providing for their family			1
all they ask is for a second chance , " @entity1 says			0
while @entity1 says he feels good about the service he provides for job seekers , naturally , not everyone shares his opinion			2
after all , not only is it unethical to lie about anything on your job application , but some argue that it puts those who have legitimate references at an unfair disadvantage			1
" it 's like using a professional photographer , who helps you look your best , versus using someone else 's photo			2
one is enhancing your appearance , while the other is blatant misrepresentation , " says @entity55 , author of " @entity56 ! your guide to making successful career moves			0
" " people do make mistakes and bad choices			2
winners learn from the mistakes while losers try to cover them up , hide them or keep making the same mistakes over and over while expecting different results			2
" is the economy to blame ? many people can agree that finding a job today is difficult and that not having anyone in your corner to toot your horn could be detrimental			2
@entity1 said he got the idea for his company after perusing posts on @entity81 , where he said he saw many users asking strangers for references			1
" we understand that there are over 12 million workers who have been fired or let go from former employers in the last eight years			2
with six applicants for every job today , anyone with a blemish in their career can be left out , " @entity1 says			1
@entity95 , résumé expert and job coach for @entity97 , says that it 's sad that job seekers would think they had to fake their references , but that she can see how the poor economy could lead to making desperate choices			1
" if a candidate was previously turned down because of a lack of reference , that otherwise honest person may decide to unethically stack the deck in his or her favor , " she says			1
" it 's kind of pathetic that anyone would have to [ use a service for a reference ] , but perhaps it could be that ' rock bottom ' that turns around bad behavior			1
" is it worth it ? some job seekers may think they need to use a fake reference because they were fired or need to cover a gap in their employment history			1
experts say that paying someone to do that for you is likely a waste -- especially since many employers ignore the references you give them anyway			1
" having consulted on hundreds of hires , i do n't care about the three personal references the candidate has given			2
anyone can find three people that will swear they can turn water into wine , " says @entity137 , career consultant and owner of @entity139			2
" i check everything else i can			0
and not just the last job , which may be a service that will vouch for them , but the job before that and the one before that , all the way down the line			2
" checking references all the way down the line has also become much easier with the advent of social networking sites like @entity158 and @entity24 , which provide a place for you to list your employment history			2
employers are n't stupid -- if a few things do n't match up , they 'll catch on pretty quickly			1
" the good thing about social networking is that the world has become a much smaller , accessible place			0
the bad thing about social networking is that the world has become a much smaller , accessible place , " @entity95 says			2
" within a few minutes , i believe that anyone with a mid-level of expertise in @entity24 or @entity158 ( combined with an elementary - level [ @entity176 ] search ) could identify fake information			1
hiring mistakes are so costly ; due diligence can really pay off in a company 's recruiting process , " @entity95 says			0
and while employers cross-reference information that candidates provide them , including references , services like @entity12 have an answer for that , too			1
" @entity12 uses [ social networks ] to our advantage , " @entity1 says			0
" as a matter of fact , it is the @entity176 and the reliance of the internet by human resource managers that make our services work so successfully			1
" consequences of your actions every action has a consequence , including providing a fake job reference to a potential employer			1
although you may not get caught , you 'll likely have to deal with trying to cover up your lies and forever worrying about if you 'll get caught			0
" liars are always going to use lies to try and put themselves at an advantage over honest people , " @entity55 says			0
" this may be effective in the short run , but over time , honesty wins out because eventually lies do get found out , and liars are exposed for who they really are			0
as in a great quote attributed to @entity221 : ' you can fool some of the people all of the time , and all of the people some of the time , but you can not fool all of the people all of the time , ' " @entity55 warns			0
the truth will set you free if you feel the need to use a fake job reference , try these three tips from our experts instead : 1			1
turn your negatives into positives " nothing builds credibility like exposing your own negatives			0
you can turn them into positives , selling points , even bragging points , " @entity139 says			0
he gives the example of @entity245 , who " provided us with all the reasons why we may not want to hire him ; all the ones that we probably would have brought up on our own once he was out of the room , and a few more we might never have come up			0
@entity245 presented his unemployability in a light made it appear that he 'd be a more reliable employee			0
and his honesty gained him a massive amount of credibility			0
do n't give up before giving up and resigning yourself to having no references , @entity95 suggests scouring @entity24 and @entity158 to try to reconnect with former colleagues			0
or , consider if you 've volunteered anywhere , played on a sports team or been a member of industry associations			0
reach out to peers from these organizations for a reference			0
" references do n't only have to come from supervisors or co-workers , " she says			0
" perhaps company clients or vendors would have a few good things to say about you			1
" if you still ca n't find anyone to give you reference by the time an employer asks for one , @entity95 suggests saying , " unbelievably , i was n't able to connect with any of my former supervisors or co-workers after @entity279 shut down unexpectedly			1
thanks to social networking , i 'm in the process of trying to find people , but it just has n't panned out yet			0
in lieu of that , i would assure you that i would n't have been able to achieve ( insert career success here ) if i was n't good at my job and i fully expect to create more successes like that one , for you			0
tackle the issue head - on instead of trying to sweep the issue under the rug , be the first one to address it , @entity55 suggests			0
" if you know you 've got something bad that would probably show up on a background check , it can help to be proactive , particularly when you 've established some degree of rapport with the hiring manager , " he suggests			1
" tell them that you want to be upfront with them -- you made a mistake in the past and they 'll probably find out anyway , but you 'd rather them hear it from you first			1
by being proactive , you have the opportunity to position it better as well , emphasizing your strengths or how you overcame that experience			0
