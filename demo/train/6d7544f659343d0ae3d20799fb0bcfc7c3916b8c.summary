editor 's note : @entity4 's essay about the deadly arrests of @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , and @entity9 in @entity10 has struck a chord			1
it touches on the topics of police behavior and resisting arrest			1
the essay was first posted as a response to a fan 's question on @entity4 's @entity21 page : " hello mr. @entity4			1
i 'm a big fan and also happen to work in the lower @entity24 as well as live in @entity26			1
i have to ask , with everything that is going on in @entity7 , how do you feel about the protests in @entity30 as well as the looting / rioting in downtown @entity32 ? hi @entity33 , last week , those very protests blocked off one of the major arteries , and as a result , i was 90 minutes late to a holiday dinner in @entity26			1
i apologized for my tardiness , and was told by my hostess not to give it a second thought			2
' it 's a small price to pay , ' she said , ' given all that 's at stake			1
' another guest , already well into the eggnog , wondered aloud if a heart attack victim waiting for an ambulance stuck in traffic might hold a different view ? within moments , everyone was talking about @entity9 and @entity6 , and the conversation got very political very quickly			1
a liberal guest said , ' look , i was n't there , but it seems pretty clear that both men would still be alive had they been white			2
' a conservative guest replied , ' i was n't there either , but it seems pretty clear that both men would still be alive if they had n't resisted arrest			1
' this annoyed the liberal , who asked the conservative why @entity67 wanted a ' police state			0
' this annoyed the conservative , who asked the liberal why @entity73 wanted ' total anarchy			0
' things continued to escalate , and within moments , fingers were pointing , veins were bulging , and logical fallacies were filling the air			0
@entity81 ! ho ! ho ! for once , i kept my mouth shut and listened as a roomful of decent people tore each others throats out			0
it was remarkable , because no one disagreed on the big points			0
no one disagreed that black lives mattered just as much as white lives			0
no one disputed that racial bias in law enforcement should be exposed and eliminated			0
in fact , no one disagreed about the basic facts surrounding each case			0
the breakdown happened over relevance and context			0
my conservative friends were focused on the fact that both men died while resisting arrest , and were therefore responsible for their own demise			1
they wanted to discuss the killings in light of the incredible risk that all police officers agree to assume			0
my liberal friends were focused on the fact that both men were unarmed , and were therefore victims of excessive force			0
they wanted to discuss the killings in the context of historical trends that suggest bias plays a recurring role in the way cops treat minorities			1
by dessert , it was clear that both sides wanted law and order			0
but the conservatives were convinced that order is only possible when citizens treat cops with respect			1
liberals , on the other hand , were arguing that order can only occur when cops treat everyone the same			1
and round and round we went			0
the chicken and the egg			0
later , on the drive home , i called a friend of mine back in @entity148			0
he 's black , successful , and hard - working			1
he also resents the way he 's gotten swept into the zeitgeist of @entity7			2
in his words , ' i 'm a pawn in someone else 's agenda , and i 'm sick of it			1
i know what bias looks like in my life			0
i 'm tired of being represented by two petty criminals who died resisting arrest			1
' i had n't thought about it like that , but he 's got a point			2
the vast majority of black @entity165 have never broken the law			0
and yet , millions of lives are now entwined with the death of @entity6 and @entity9			1
that 's not fair , but it 's hardly breaking news			2
minorities are constantly stereotyped and the impression lingers			0
looters and arsonists run amok , and @entity176 suffers the association			0
now i 'm trying to get my head around the fact that two cops are dead in @entity181 , assassinated by a lunatic in ' retaliation ' for @entity7 and @entity184			1
how much worse can it get for the millions of law - abiding minorities , struggling to be seen as individuals ? how much worse can it get for the thousands of honest cops , trying to protect a citizenry that does n't seem to appreciate their daily sacrifice ? a few days ago , people were marching in the streets , literally calling for the execution of police			2
( ' what do we want ? @entity201 ! ' ) others are standing by today , waiting to lionize the assassins who answer the call			0
these are not the champions of justice ; these are the enemies of civilization , and it 's up to sensible people on both sides of the aisle to close ranks and shout them down			2
if we want to live in a nation of laws , we need to support the humans sworn to uphold them			2
they 're a lot of really great cops out there who have promised to do that very thing , including the one in my family			2
we 'd be screwed without them			0
to answer your question @entity33 , i support peaceful protests , and i 'm all for rooting out bad cops			1
but let 's not stop there			2
if we 're serious about saving lives , and eliminating the confrontations that lead to the demise of @entity9 and @entity6 , let 's also condemn the stupidity that leads so many @entity165 to resist arrest			1
i do n't care if you 're white , black , red , periwinkle , burnt umber , or chartreuse -- resisting arrest is not a right , it 's a crime			1
and it 's never a good idea			2
