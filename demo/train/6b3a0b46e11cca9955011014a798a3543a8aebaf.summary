-- booed and jeered upon his entrance , cheered upon his exit -- perhaps even the most bitter of rivals are finally ready to submit to the mercurial talents of @entity7			1
few former @entity9 players have been given the ovation which @entity7 received from an @entity12 crowd , but then again , this is not just any player			2
@entity7 had never scored at @entity12 during his time with @entity9 -- it was a statistic which took just 23 minutes to become history			2
a 3 - 0 victory over @entity18 , inspired by @entity7 , ensured @entity19 made it nine points out of nine in @entity22 a 70th @entity24 strike means he is just one behind the all - time leading scorer , @entity26 , the man so revered by all at @entity19			1
the record will soon fall , @entity7 and @entity29 , who has 69 , will set records which few would have ever imagined possible			2
for @entity19 , a club record seventh consecutive @entity33 victory was assured courtesy of @entity7 's breathtaking strike and @entity37 's double			1
for all the pre-match hype of another ' special @entity33 night ' at @entity12 , it was all pretty routine			0
@entity18 , the five - time winner , was blown away by the pace and power of @entity19 as @entity7 took center stage			1
" it was special , my first goal at @entity12 and i am very happy -- amazing , " @entity7 told @entity44 " we knew that @entity12 is a difficult place , but we were fantastic in the first 45 minutes and we deserved to win			2
" i 'm not worried about the @entity24 goalscoring record			2
i know i will beat it			0
me and @entity29 are very close			0
" the best thing is that the team has nine points			0
" can we retain the cup ? why not ? we are taking it step - by - step but we are going to try			0
" we know it will be tough but we are positive and it is possible			0
" no team has ever managed to retain the @entity24 title since it was revamped into its current format in 1992 , but @entity19 will certainly go close in it attempt to record an unprecedented 11th triumph			1
a day after @entity63 had ransacked @entity64 by scoring seven , @entity19 arrived at another of @entity33 football 's most famous fortresses and blew it to smithereens			1
this was a result that most would have anticipated given @entity18 's stuttering start to the season but the way in which @entity19 scythed through its opponents was nothing short of exquisite			1
deprived of @entity77 , who remained in the @entity79 capital nursing an injury , @entity19 was able to call on its hosts of stars as it taught @entity18 a lesson in the art of attacking football			1
in @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , @entity19 boasted a midfield which most teams could only dream of			2
while @entity18 , so inconsistent following the success of last season and the departure of @entity95 , has struggled in recent weeks , @entity19 has been on cruise control			1
seven consecutive victories which have yielded 32 goals meant @entity19 arrived as favorites at a stadium where it had never managed to win before			2
and yet , any doubts over its ability to break its three - game losing streak against @entity18 were soon extinguished			1
the breakthrough came after 23 minutes -- and it was worth waiting for			0
@entity7 , who appeared to induce panic each and every time he as much as breathed , laid the ball off to @entity86 , who in turn produced a quite sumptuous pass over the top of the @entity18 defense			1
with those in red caught watching the flight of the ball , @entity7 ran in behind and produced a finish which belied belief , flicking the ball into the far corner with unerring accuracy			2
that strike , the forward 's 20th in 13 games this season , seemed to leave @entity18 winded -- a blow from which it never recovered			2
seven minutes later , the contest was all but over as @entity37 pulled away at the far post to send a looping header into the opposite corner following rather questionable @entity18 defending			1
in the three previous meetings between the two sides , @entity19 had never managed a goal , let alone a victory			2
defeated 4 - 0 on its last visit to @entity12 five years ago , @entity19 appeared determined to exorcize its demons			1
a third goal followed just before the interval , @entity37 once again the grateful recipient of some more woeful home defending			2
to its credit , @entity18 refused to give up after falling three goals behind and only the post denied @entity143 from dragging his side back into the contest			0
the second half was a rather tame affair as @entity18 briefly attempted to launch a response , though without the disappointing @entity149 , who was withdrawn at the interval			0
with the first @entity151 of the season on saturday , @entity19 took its foot off the gas , though more goals should have been forthcoming			0
@entity7 should have added a fourth midway through the second half after the visiting side had cut through the @entity18 defense with embarrassing ease , but for once , the @entity161 forward was unable to find a way past goalkeeper @entity163			1
in the end , @entity7 had to settle for a solitary strike and an early exit as he was replaced with 15 minutes remaining as @entity167 , the @entity19 coach , began to look towards saturday 's clash with @entity169			1
" it was the best we have played all season , " said @entity167			0
" we were fantastic in the first half and then controlled the game			0
i had to say nothing to the players , they played really well			0
" i am lucky to manage this group of players			0
" @entity18 will face @entity19 once more in a fortnight 's time in the return game but it 's chances of qualification remain in the balance			1
" the first 22 minutes of the game we were excellent but from the first goal to halftime , @entity19 showed their real quality , " @entity187 , the @entity18 manager , told @entity44			1
second half we played for pride and we were outstanding , the players kept going , they did n't stop			0
we defended poorly but i ca n't ask any more			0
" you can see @entity19 's quality			0
speed , technique ; you can see why they are champions			0
" the second and third goals are from set - pieces again , it 's an issue for us and we have to be better than that			0
" the defeat leaves @entity18 on three points , level with @entity215 side @entity213 and @entity217 club @entity216			0
ludogorets claimed its first ever @entity24 victory with a 1 - 0 win over @entity216			1
@entity221 beaten elsewhere , @entity221 suffered a shock 1 - 0 defeat away at @entity224			1
the @entity226 side , top of @entity228 , was beaten by a @entity230 strike as the @entity231 made it two home wins out of two			0
@entity233 , which was beaten on its visit to @entity231 , eased to a 5 - 0 victory over @entity238 club @entity236			1
@entity233 , beaten in last season 's final , scored all five goals in the second half			0
in @entity244 , @entity243 made it three wins out of three with an emphatic 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity247			1
@entity248 sits second after scoring twice in the final two minutes to steal a 2 - 1 win at @entity250			0
in @entity252 , @entity251 overcame @entity253 2 - 0 , while @entity254 and @entity255 finished goalless .			1
