-- a group of architects gathered in @entity3 , @entity4 last month with an unusual brief -- to design the ultimate dream home for bats			1
the winged mammals are valued from an ecological viewpoint for preying on insects , dispersing seeds and pollination			2
but their numbers have declined dramatically in @entity15 , where a fungal disease called white nose syndrome is estimated to have killed more than 5.5 million			0
in the @entity19 , the fungus has yet to appear , but habitat destruction remains a major threat			1
policy - makers in the @entity19 have stepped in to protect bat populations , criminalizing any interference with their roosts , even if no bats are currently present			1
" if you have bats roosting in your building , you ca n't disturb them in any way without getting a special license , " says @entity27 , @entity28 with the @entity29 , a charitable organization in @entity30 , @entity4			1
those who interfere with a roost risk a fine of $ 7,800 per bat , and up to six months in prison -- although @entity27 says no one has been sent to prison yet			0
the new , three - hour course , offered by the @entity44 in conjunction with the @entity29 , is intended to educate architects about bats , teaching participants the ideal size , access points , temperature , materials and location for bat roosts			1
" they need to design these spaces which are biodiversity - friendly , but they 're not ecologists , " explains @entity27			0
" this gives them a basic introduction to their life cycle , when they breed , and their requirements for roosting			0
" bats prefer to roost in natural features like trees and caves , but as development has made those environments scarcer , some species have adapted to urban areas			1
" only about half the bats here regularly use buildings as roosts , although nearly all of them will use them at some stage , " says @entity27			1
" unfortunately , with a lot of people doing loft conversions and barn conversions , that 's had a huge impact			0
bats only have one young a year , and they do n't have them every year , so if they were using your roof loft as their maternity roost and you knocked down the building or put in a loft extension , it would wipe out that whole population			1
" research ship finds the world 's oceans are ' plasticized ' bats present several logistical challenges for designers			1
@entity4 bats are tiny , with the smallest species , the pipistrelle , able to fit into a matchbox			1
" they can squeeze into the smallest places , " says @entity27			0
" literally , if you can put your finger into a gap , a bat can get in there			0
" they have varying space requirements			0
some species prefer tight spaces like cavities under roof piles , others need more space , like that found in attics			0
all bats need darkness and warmth			1
a problem for both builders and bat conservationists is the widespread use in modern buildings of " breathable roofing membranes " , a type of insulating textile which allows air vapor to escape			1
roosting bats can get fatally entangled in the fibers , which degrades the roofing membranes , invalidating their guarantees			1
solar panels present another issue			0
" it 's very preliminary , but there seems to be evidence that when you put solar panels on your roof , it can increase the internal roof void temperature , which can be disturbing to bats , " says @entity27			1
@entity151 , who has an architecture practice in @entity30 , has built a bespoke bat barn that was shortlisted for a sustainability award by the @entity155 last year			0
wine turbine creates water from thin air while demolishing a 100 - year - old brick farmhouse in @entity160 , @entity4 , a maternity roost for brown long - eared bats was found in the attic			1
this meant @entity151 had to provide a new roost , which took six weeks more than $ 70,000 to complete			0
his design incorporates a downward - angled port where bats can enter , leading to a 34mm - wide chute with roughened timber walls which they can crawl up to gain access to an attic 10.5m long and 3m high at the apex			2
once the barn was finished , the sleeping bats were put into a soft bag by an ecology consultant , and delivered to awaken in their new home			2
" he also transferred their droppings , so they could smell a bat - friendly area , " @entity151 says			0
although the @entity160 bats appear to have taken up residence , @entity27 says there 's never any guarantee that such solutions will work			2
" the problem we have is that , even if you take everything into account for the bats , they often just wo n't use the space you 've created , " says @entity27			2
" or , if they do , it can take them up to five years			0
" she continued : " a few years ago we had a bat house design competition			0
they got architects involved and built a bat house at the @entity204			2
that 's quite a nicely designed bat house , but two years on , it 's never been used by bats			2
sometimes you can do everything absolutely right , and it still wo n't be used			0

a new course aims to teach architects how to accommodate bats
@entity19 *legislation* protects bats and their roosts , with fines and jail time for *offenders*
bats can get tangled in some modern roofing insulation
some @entity4 bats are small enough to fit into a matchbox
