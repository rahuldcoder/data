" @entity4 , " the now defunct mobile sensation , will one day rise like a phoenix and fling itself awkwardly into an app store near you			1
@entity4 , the creator of the infuriatingly addictive and deceptively difficult mobile game confirmed as much early wednesday on @entity12			1
responding to a tweet @entity15 sent last month , a follower directly asked if he plans to ever make the game available again			1
" yes , " @entity17 replied			2
" that 's an about - face from last month , when @entity17 , in a rare interview , told @entity20 that " @entity4 " was " gone forever			1
" originally released last may , " @entity4 " had largely languished before a surge in popularity , starting around december , that would see it become the most downloaded app in both @entity27 's @entity26 and the @entity28 for @entity30 devices			1
at the time of its demise , " @entity4 " had an average four - star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the @entity26 and 228,000 on @entity30			2
many of the reviews were lengthy , tongue - in - cheek tales of time lost , marriages ended and people going cuckoo after playing the game			0
at the time , @entity17 said he was afraid that what he 'd intended to be a simple pastime had gotten out of control and become " addictive " to some users			2
the @entity48 developer , who has stayed largely out of the spotlight , had also come under intense scrutiny , with some accusing him ( without evidence , it should be noted ) of using bots to artificially inflate the game 's app - store rankings			0
people who had already downloaded the app did n't lose it , but those who had n't were out of luck			0
and so , we wait			0
in the mean time , @entity62 , @entity17 's studio , has two other games available for download -- " @entity66 " and " @entity67			0
" and he promises more to come -- probably before we see " @entity4 " again			0
or you could just busy yourself with one of the multitude of " @entity4 " clones , which continue to flood app stores at insane rates .			1

' @entity4 ' creator say game will come back to app stores
@entity4 pulled game last month
@entity17 said it will be back but " not soon "
