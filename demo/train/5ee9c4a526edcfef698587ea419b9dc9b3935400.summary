-- for most of his 70 years , @entity1 has been a man of good will , preaching the word of @entity4			1
these days , the @entity6 priest is a self - described @entity7 -- a war veteran			2
that he should feel so within the confines of the sanctuary tells all about the violence and pervasive fear that have gripped the border city of @entity14 , @entity15			1
" none of us are entirely safe from organized crime			1
not even priests , " @entity1 says			1
trepidation leaks out with every word			0
perhaps the most important aspect of his job as a priest makes him a potential target for organized crime			1
criminals know that grisly details of violence have spilled out in the privacy of the confessional , and crime bosses would rather not have those details repeated or remembered			1
a bloody war between @entity15 's drug cartels has changed every facet of life in places such as @entity14 , where death figures compare to those in war - ravaged @entity42 or @entity44			1
even the untouchable aura of clerics in the world 's second - biggest @entity6 country is being challenged			2
in 2009 , more than 2,575 people were homicide victims of organized crime			1
as of monday , 230 killings had been recorded in @entity14 this year , state attorney general 's office spokesman @entity51 told @entity0			2
all of the estimated 1.4 million residents in @entity14 -- just across the border from @entity56 , @entity57 -- have been affected , if only indirectly , by an escalating turf war between the @entity59 and the @entity61 cartel , better known as the @entity14 cartel			2
the fallout , mainly over @entity14 's trafficking route , has turned once - close allies into deadly rivals			1
until about 2001 , the two cartels operated with mutual respect , navigating the territory almost harmoniously and sometimes working together to transport drugs from the region to the insatiable market of drug users in the @entity74			2
but now , a crackdown by president @entity76 , coupled with dissolved trusts among key cartel members , have created knee - jerk chaos			2
gangs affiliated with the cartels have heightened the violence as they fight for turf in street - level sales , @entity14 mayor @entity80 told @entity0			1
@entity14 was once a city where innocents were safe , but that memory is fading fast			1
even those who are n't aligned with the drug trade have been targeted , among them priests			1
they were once revered in @entity15 communities , but a collar is not protection anymore in the violent clashes over territory and power			0
@entity1 , who ought to fear nothing , watches his back			1
he agreed to be interviewed by @entity0 , but balked at being photographed or even having a photo of his church published , citing safety concerns			2
he closes the doors to his church earlier			1
at @entity107 , he asks parishioners to enter through a specific door rather than flock in from every direction			0
the church offices are dead - bolted shut			1
the paralysis - like atmosphere spills onto the streets , shops and residences of @entity14 , where incredulous people peep through window blinds and seemingly creep by in the streets			1
many residents escape from populated parts of town during the day and often stay home after dusk			0
life goes on amid the violence , and added precautions are taken in stride			0
sometimes , @entity1 wonders who among his flock might leave the church and pick up an assault weapon			1
he does not know whether there are killers who step inside the sanctuary			0
but he knows there are victims			0
he attended the funeral of a lawyer who was assassinated			0
during the procession , the lawyer 's daughter was gunned down before @entity1			2
the convoy she was in , which followed her father 's casket , was ambushed by gunmen as it approached the cemetery			0
@entity1 said he did n't know whether she was the target , but the lawyer was an outspoken critic of organized crime			1
@entity1 was uneasy when asked for other details			2
" i ca n't explain to you what it 's like to go to the funeral of someone you 've prayed with , " he said			0
but he mentally braces for more of the same			0
two weeks before @entity161 , a gunman roughed up a priest at a nearby church			0
the attacker fled with the priest 's wallet and mobile phone			0
sometimes in @entity14 , violence happens because it can , because no one will think it extraordinary			1
two weeks ago , the body of a sacristan -- a person charged with taking care of a church -- was found with fatal stab wounds in a church in western @entity14			2
no motive was apparent , a police spokesman told @entity0			0
there are those who take advantage of the chaos in a place like @entity14 , @entity1 says			1
some crimes are committed by petty thieves who pass themselves off as cartel members			0
" not all crime is organized , " he said			2
@entity1 spoke with @entity0 days after @entity14 diocese @entity189 read an open letter to more than 1,000 parishioners at his church for sunday @entity107 the letter , written by the bishops of @entity15 , addressed organized crime			1
in the speech , @entity197 called for organized criminals to give up their lifestyle and turn to @entity4			0
he also said priests in @entity14 are now being extorted and threatened by organized criminals			1
to ensure that priests do not repeat what parishioners tell them , drug traffickers are sending a message			1
" yes , there have been some priests that have received threatening phone calls from narcotraficantes			0
not me , but others			0
we 're not necessarily singled out by them			0
we 're victims like every other citizen			0
no more , no less , " @entity1 says			2
at least seven priests have been violently killed in @entity15 since 2005 , including being kidnapped , shot and beaten			0
organized crime has been suspected in some of those cases , according to @entity222 , public relations secretary for @entity15 's @entity223			1
he estimated that 1,000 of the 15,000 priests in @entity15 have been threatened in some way , and that 300 priests have been threatened directly			0
in june 2009 , the killings of a catholic priest and two seminary students as they left a church in southern @entity15 sparked outrage			0
the priest was reportedly singled out for denouncing cartel violence			0
he had rallied congregants to rise up against drug traffickers			1
especially in rural villages across @entity15 -- where drug traffickers reign like kings and the military has no presence -- it is the @entity6 and evangelists who are left as outspoken critics			1
however , in some of @entity15 's poorest villages , it is unclear how closely the church and organized criminals operate			2
some critics say churches have received large donations from traffickers			0
for @entity1 and his brethren , faith is still central to much of life			2
but fear tests that faith , including the fear of being powerless to make things better			0
@entity0 's @entity258 and @entity259 contributed to this report .			0

for @entity1 , fear of violence *permeates* his work and church
@entity1 : " none of us are entirely safe from organized crime . not even priests . "
he closes the doors to his church earlier ; church offices are dead - bolted shut
