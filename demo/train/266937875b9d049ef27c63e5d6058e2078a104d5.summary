@entity0 , @entity1 -- after months in an immigration detention facility , @entity3 was so surprised when guards said he could go that he did n't believe them			2
" they had to shout ( the news ) at him so he would leave , " his wife , @entity6 , said this week			2
the family soon learned that @entity3 -- who had first been arrested on a drunk driving charge -- was one of more than 2,000 immigration detainees federal authorities released last month in a controversial move that officials said would cut costs as forced budget cuts loomed			1
but the construction worker 's joy at being released was short - lived			1
now , the undocumented immigrant is back behind bars			1
so are more than two dozen others , according to federal officials			2
" the 28 individuals were brought back into @entity25 custody after either violating the terms of their supervision or after the agency discovered information not available during an initial review of their case , " @entity25 spokeswoman @entity24 said in a written statement			1
" @entity25 will continue to review the terms of the release for the individuals as part of its routine practice and will reconsider conditions as necessary			1
" @entity3 was detained again after an arrest for driving without a license , his wife says , adding that she thinks authorities targeted him because they wanted to send him back to the detention facility			1
" they were waiting for him , " @entity48 says			0
debate over the decision to release detainees resurged this week at a hearing before the @entity54 , where some lawmakers accused the country 's top immigration official of releasing detainees for political reasons			1
" this release is a recipe for disaster that is irresponsible and unjustified , " said rep. @entity60 , a @entity61 from @entity62 who chairs the committee			2
" ultimately , these nonsensical actions demonstrate the inability and lack of desire on behalf of the administration to enforce the law even against illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes			0
" @entity25 officials have said the move was made because the agency was preparing its year - end budget and had to take the $ 85 billion in forced government - wide budget cuts , known as sequestration , into account			1
and they stressed that detainees released were non-criminals or low - risk offenders without serious criminal histories			1
this week , @entity25 director @entity88 maintained that the measure was necessary to cut costs			1
" the agency is asked to do far more than @entity92 could appropriate or could rationally appropriate to the agency			0
we are in a situation where there are 11 million people on average who are here unlawfully			0
the agency has resources to remove about 400,000 a year , which is less than 4 % and it is why at the end of the day , i think , bipartisan efforts to come to some level of comprehensive immigration reform is the thoughtful way out , " he said this week			0
" the agency is never going to be able to detain and remove everybody as a matter of budget nor does it make sense as a matter of policy			0
" @entity88 said the detainees that were released were not dangerous , and that he had to find some way to make ends meet			1
" i did not want to rob @entity120 to pay @entity121 , " he said			0
" my view is that we need to maintain the operations of the agency			0
" rep. @entity126 , a @entity61 from @entity1 , criticized that explanation			0
" now , i 've counted six times you have said you did n't want to rob @entity120 to pay @entity121 , " @entity126 said			0
" i do n't want @entity120 or @entity121 to rob one of our fellow citizens because you guessed wrong on who to release			2
" meanwhile , @entity48 says she and her five children are left looking at pictures of her husband in their @entity1 home , wondering when they 'll see him again and whether he 'll be deported to @entity139			0
