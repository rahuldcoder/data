-- @entity1 , the baby star of best - selling author @entity3 's classic memoir , " @entity4 , " was finally grown up and safely ensconced at art school in @entity6			1
before @entity1 was born and during his childhood , @entity3 had developed a community of family and friends who had known and loved them during the lean years			1
she had written several notable novels and works of nonfiction			2
now that @entity1 had moved out , @entity3 had the rest of her life to live			1
surrounded by the love of her community , she had a wonderful home in @entity20 with room for guests and dogs and an interesting professional and personal life			2
one day before @entity3 's @entity26 dinner for 25 , she got the call			1
@entity1 , only 19 , told her that his girlfriend was pregnant			1
or was it his ex-girlfriend ? @entity1 and @entity31 had broken up a couple months earlier but clearly had continued to spend time together			2
they were keeping the baby			2
@entity34 was born on july 20 , 2009			2
@entity3 , who turns 58 on tuesday , had famously recounted her first year with @entity1 in a memoir that validated all the joy and agony and terror foisted upon her during her child 's first year , made more challenging by the absence of the would - be father			1
in a new memoir , " @entity43 : a journal of @entity56 's @entity55 , " @entity3 ( with @entity1 's help ) recounts her surprise and acceptance at becoming a grandmother earlier than expected , her fears related to @entity1 and @entity31 becoming parents at such a young age and her daily celebration of her grandson 's life			1
the book will debut sunday on the @entity60 best - sellers list			2
" i was happy all the time at the thought of @entity1 's being a father , and my getting to be a grandmother , except when i was sick with fears about their future , enraged that they had gotten themselves pregnant so young or in a swivet of trying to control their every move , not to mention every aspect of their futures , " she wrote			1
in a conversation with @entity0 , @entity3 described her ongoing challenge -- a classic dilemma of the grandparent -- to contain her overwhelming need to advise @entity1 and @entity31 on every aspect of her grandson 's young life			1
@entity0 : what was your fantasy of life as a grandmother ? @entity3 : it would be 10 years later			1
@entity1 would be 29 and be the right age , young enough to have energy but old enough to have a fully formed cortex			2
he would only work four days per week because he would be so successful			2
i 'd be really close to his wife			0
they 'd come over , and we 'd hang out			0
or it would be horrible			0
they 'd live 1,000 miles away , and i 'd fly there all the time			0
everybody would be settled and successful			0
@entity0 : what were your fears given how young @entity1 and @entity31 are ? @entity3 : i was very calm when @entity1 first told me , but i 'm one of those religious people who are afraid of everything			1
i 'm instantly worried about everything that could go wrong			0
i thought , " it 's all over , it 's hopeless			1
he 's going to drop out of school , work as a janitor and live with me			1
" i feared @entity31 would move , that the financial strain would be enormous , that @entity1 would n't stand up and do the right thing and that he would drop out of school			0
it 's the familiar story of young people dropping out of school and getting dead - end jobs			1
i had every scary thought			0
no matter what circumstances , it 's hard to be a parent and maintain a sense of self and identity in the world			1
i do n't have any romantic views of parenting			0
every step of the way it 's really hard			1
it 's a dangerous world , physically and psychologically			1
@entity0 : how do you stop yourself from trying to control their lives ? @entity3 : i knew i 'm a control freak and that i would want to manage their lives and be the third parent			1
i had to be very strict with myself and get help for my issues all the time			0
i could not say this was my kid , too			0
i would stop and say , " wait , why am i talking ? " another woman , who had a grandkid when her daughter was young , told me , " it 's their dishes and their sink			1
" it 's intrusive for grandparents to think they 're in charge			1
also , it 's self - destructive , since if the parents have to resist you , you wo n't get your mitts on the kid as often			1
once they do n't have to resist you , they want to be around you			0
i was the one with the credit card and the washer dryer			0
if i did n't crowd them and show up with my clip board , they 'd call or come over and do laundry			0
@entity0 : sometimes you have to speak up ! what questions do you ask yourself before interfering ? @entity3 : because i 'm helping @entity1 and @entity34 financially , i 'm bearing the bulk of the financial responsibility			1
i try to ask myself , " who says this is my business ? does this have my name on it ? " if something is urgent , my experience says it 's probably not @entity175 talking			1
it 's usually my self will and low - level hysteria			1
if there 's any way i can postpone saying it , it dampens the urgency			2
then i can probably talk to a friend			0
left to my own devices , my first inclination is to mess in other people 's lives			2
i secretly believe my whole family , and really the whole world , is my responsibility			0
but over the years , i 've learned i can release people to their own destiny , and do the work that 's ahead of me : writing for certain number of hours every day , teaching , church , friendships of 25 years , my dogs , our walks			2
@entity0 : what is a grandma 's job ? @entity3 : my job of grandma is to keep the house safe for when @entity34 comes over			1
he and @entity1 usually come over on weekends , and i visit tuesdays at @entity1 's apartment			2
i take up the slack			0
i 'm the outdoorsy one who convinces everyone to take walks with me for owl prowls , not that we have ever seen an owl			0
i 'm the chief librarian			0
there have been hard days since @entity34 was born , and it 's also been the greatest blessing of my life			2
@entity0 : now that @entity1 and @entity31 have split up , how does a grandma handle the breakup ? @entity3 : it 's sort of the same thing			1
i have excellent ideas about how things should proceed now			0
i pray to @entity175 to keep one hand around my shoulder and one hand on my mouth			0
if anyone asks my advice , i give it to them			2
i 'm trying not to manage their lives or custody decisions			0
it 's between the two parents , who get to make 100 % of the decisions			1
@entity1 recommends that if you 've got a problem , go work it out in the mirror			0
i 'll ask myself , " what 's going on ? what 's this really about ? " @entity0 : when @entity34 wants to run away from his supremely embarrassing parents , will he run to you ? @entity3 : all parents are an embarrassment to their kids			1
often grandparents are the relief			0
kids do n't have to resist you			0
i 've had the blessing of being someone that kids really love , so a number of kids have run away to me over the years			0
i always feed them , make them a cup of tea and take them for a walk			0
i 'll do the same with @entity34 if the time ever comes			0
then i 'll sneak to the bathroom and call @entity31 or @entity1 on my cell .			0
