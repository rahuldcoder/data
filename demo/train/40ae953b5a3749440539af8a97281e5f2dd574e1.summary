@entity0 -- it was the fall of 1995 , and there was open warfare in @entity0 over the @entity6 ' @entity5			0
liberals had declared that civilization as we knew it was imperiled by the evil machinations of @entity11 and co. this is to be expected of liberals on @entity15 -- but those were n't the effective ones			1
it was their colleagues in the national so - called " objective " so - called " news " media whose " reporting " was poisoning the public discourse			1
former @entity27 anchor @entity26 was a frequent target of conservatives ' ire			1
on november 28 , he was a guest of @entity31 , the top - rated conservative radio talk show host in @entity33 , @entity34			2
@entity31 directly accused him of having a liberal bias , but @entity26 would have none of it			2
" i 'm a lifetime reporter			0
what i care about is news , " @entity26 insisted in his telephone interview with the @entity40 host			2
" i 'm all news , all the time			2
full power , tall tower , i want to break in when news breaks out			2
now , very respectfully , when you start talking about a liberal agenda and all the , quote , liberal bias in the media , i quite frankly , and i say this respectfully but candidly to you , i do n't know what you 're talking about			1
... what i do n't like , and if you want to see my neck swell or the hair begin to rise on the back of my neck , is to be tagged by somebody else 's label			1
" @entity31 was unimpressed , insisting that @entity26 was biased			0
callers called and repeated the accusation			0
" oh , bullfeathers , bullfeathers			0
total , complete bullfeathers ! look , there is a limit where you have to just say , ' listen , this is off - the - wall stuff , ' and this is off the wall			0
... listen , my answer to the lady [ is ] madam , prove it and i 'll report it			0
or get somebody to prove it and i 'll report it			0
" but then the golden moment arrived			0
@entity31 asked about the " @entity82 " campaign and how the press was willfully echoing the @entity85 line that @entity6 wanted to cut @entity87 coverage , which was simply false			2
@entity26 's answer was remarkable : " on the ' @entity90 , ' here 's what we try to do			2
we catch it from both sides on this , which does n't necessarily mean we 've been doing it right			2
some of the time , we use the language , ' medicare cuts , ' which is what the @entity85 insist these are , and some of the time , we use that these are , ' cuts in the rate of growth for @entity87 , ' which is what the @entity6 prefer			0
we try to walk that line , we try to call it one way one time , one way the next time ... " this was too much for @entity31 , who pointed out that it simply was not true that @entity27 was giving equal time and , besides , if it were , it would mean that at best , @entity27 would be telling the truth only half the time			0
it was a perfect illustration of the challenge conservatives faced 15 years ago with a national news media almost uniformly liberal and arrogant and blatantly advancing a political agenda rather than reporting news			1
their contempt for anything conservative was palpable , and should an uppity right - winger -- @entity124 , @entity125 -- catch fire , the media hellfire was as ferocious as it was predictable			1
conservatives did n't stand a chance			1
they owned a handful of newspapers and opinion magazines , and if they combined their audiences , they could match perhaps a tenth of the audience of just one television news network			2
conservative talk radio was exploding , to be sure , but as opposed to " news reporting , " @entity140 and the industry he spawned were ( correctly ) labeled as biased , and their reports labeled commentary			1
the nature of their business was such that conservatives could only react with opinions to what liberals presented as objective truth			0
today , the internet has changed everything			1
enter the citizen journalist , the person ( or entity ) that can now create news and present it directly to the public without going through the filter of the liberal press			1
the left no longer controls the flow of information and therefore no longer can control the narrative			0
for years , there 's been systematic corruption at federally funded outfits like @entity171 ; it took @entity173 and @entity174 -- armed with a camera and a chinchilla coat -- to bring them down			1
the liberal press has filed hundreds of stories about " racism " at the @entity182 rallies ; one black conservative activist at @entity184 , armed with a camera and a creative impulse , simply filmed the blacks who participate in the rallies to shatter the canard			1
in 2004 , @entity26 tried to take down president @entity190 when he challenged the authenticity of his military service ; instead , conservatives on the internet exposed the dishonesty of his hit piece and took down @entity26			1
the left is , of course , apoplectic now			0
" why , just look at the abuses ! " they scream , even when they ca n't find them			0
are there land mines out there ? sure			0
could the citizen journalist abuse the public trust ? hypothetically , of course			0
conservatives must all guard against this			0
an example of abusing that trust is the attempted prank by @entity173 against @entity1 , which i have clearly stated is not in line with the conservative movement			1
@entity218 's full statement on the attempted @entity1 prank let there be scrutiny , by all means			1
but however it 's done , those who devoted themselves to advancing a liberal agenda on the traditional media , all the while calling it " news , " and those who turned a blind eye to these abuses over the past half - century , should kindly recuse themselves from the conversation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			1

@entity236 says that 15 years ago , conservatives could n't expect fair shake in the media
but today , internet lets citizen journalists present news without filter of liberal press , he says
@entity1 's " @entity251 " follows several young conservative activist journalists
