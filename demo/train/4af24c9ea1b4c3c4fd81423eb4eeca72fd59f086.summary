-- when @entity2 released its @entity4 system this month , it propelled the company into the increasingly competitive marketplace of devices that stream web content into the living room			1
the set - top box now competes with @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , as well as early innovator @entity14 and even the gaming world 's top consoles for the eyeballs of people who stream services like @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 onto their televisions			1
these devices are relatively new innovations : @entity14 first announced a simple @entity21 - streaming box in 2008			1
but in recent years , more and more people have begun using devices that harness the @entity31 's bountiful offerings and send them , usually via @entity32 , to a tv set			2
according to @entity38 , almost half of all @entity36 adults and 67 % of young adults now watch streamed or downloaded video at least once a week			2
and 7.6 million households in the @entity36 have " cut the cord , " using web streaming and downloading exclusively instead of cable , satellite or broadcast , for their television viewing , the company said in a report this week			1
but it 's still a new concept for a lot of folks			2
and with so many players in the game , not to mention a new wave of " smart tvs " that hook up to the web on their own , it can be hard to pick a favorite			2
if you own a smart tv , you may not need a separate device for streaming			2
but the software on many smart @entity64 is still clunky , and most web - streaming gadgets offer a larger menu of apps and channels			2
