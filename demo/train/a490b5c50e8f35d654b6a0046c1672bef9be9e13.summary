-- it has been 20 years since filmmaker @entity2 took on @entity3 in " @entity4			1
" he 's still sticking it to big business for what he sees as the deliberate shafting of the little guy			2
filmmaker @entity2 says @entity10 created a " invisible virtual casino " with people 's money			1
his new film , " capitalism : a @entity18 , " opened wednesday in @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity17 , and opens nationwide next week			1
@entity2 talked with @entity0 's @entity19 about whether capitalism is key to the @entity21 or the cause of an @entity24 nightmare			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			2
@entity19 : you describe this movie as the culmination of all the films you 've made			1
does that mean this is it ? @entity2 : no. i hope not			1
it means that , for 20 years , as you said , i 've been doing this			0
i started out by showing people what @entity3 was up to and how this was a company that was making a lot of bad decisions and it was n't good for the company nor for the country			0
that was 20 years ago			0
and since then , i 've covered a number of issues and different things			0
but it all seems to come back to this one issue of " follow the money			2
" who 's got the money ? and whoever has the money has the power			2
and right now , in @entity24 , tonight , @entity19 , the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined			1
@entity19 : you 're in that 1 percent , though ? @entity2 : i do n't think i 'm in that 1 percent , but i make documentary films			1
but i mean , obviously , i do well because my films have done well			0
but , you know , even if i were , i think it 's my responsibility -- my moral duty that if i 've done well , that i have to make sure that everybody else			0
@entity19 : does well too or has a chance ? @entity2 : well , has at least a chance but that -- and that the pie is divided fairly amongst the people and not just a few people get the majority of the loot and everybody else has to struggle for the crumbs			1
@entity19 : are you saying capitalism is a failure ? @entity2 : yes			1
well , i do n't have to say it			0
capitalism , in the last year , has proven that it 's failed			2
all the basic tenets of what we 've talked about the free market , about free enterprise and competition just completely fell apart			0
as soon as they lost , essentially , our money , they came running to the federal government for a bailout -- for welfare , for socialism			2
and i thought the basic principle of capitalism was that it 's a sink - or - swim situation			2
and those who do well , the cream rises to the top and , you know , those who invest their money wrongly or , you know , do n't run their business the right way , then they do n't do well			2
watch @entity2 talk about corporate greed and if you run your business the wrong way , where does it say that you or i or anybody watching this has to bail them out ? i understand why everybody seemed to get behind it , because a lot of people were afraid , because these people down on @entity10 had taken our money and made bets with it			1
i mean , they essentially created this invisible virtual casino with people 's money -- people 's pension funds , people 's 401 ( k ) s. they took this money and they made bets			1
and then they made bets on the bets			1
and then they took out insurance policies on the bets			2
and then they took out insurance against the insurance -- the credit default swaps			0
@entity19 : you started filming before @entity141 went belly up			0
@entity19 : the stock market tanked			0
now , how did the events , as it occurred , affect the movie ? did it change gears ? @entity2 : it did n't change in terms of what i was looking at , but it did , obviously , offer probably the best example of why this is a system that is really corrupt at its core -- corrupt because it does n't , it is n't run with democratic -- small " d " -- democratic principles			1
there 's no democracy in our economy			0
you and i and the people watching have no say in how this economy is run			0
the upper 1 percent , the people down on @entity10 , the corporate executives , they 're the people that control this economy			1
@entity19 : and they do n't want to see the economy do well ? they do n't want to see people ... @entity2 : oh , they sure do			1
@entity19 : do n't they want people to make money so they can buy the products ? i mean it 's silly if they want people unemployed ? @entity2 : oddly enough , yes			1
@entity19 : why ? @entity2 : i 'll tell you why			1
because your employees are your biggest expense			0
and , as you 've noticed in the last few months , as the unemployment rate has gone up , so has the @entity190			0
now , you 'd think , you know , that @entity10 would respond with " oh , my @entity193 , unemployment is going up , you know , this is bad for business			1
" but the reality is , is that @entity10 likes that			1
they like it when companies fire people because immediately the bottom line is going to show a larger profit			2
@entity19 : are you saying the investor is more important than the employee ? @entity2 : yes			1
the investor -- and the investor , these days , they want the short - term , quick profit and they want it now			0
but in the long - term , here 's what happened			0
when i was on this show 20 years ago , 20 years ago this week , i was here with " @entity4 "			0
@entity2 : and @entity3 , that year , made a profit of $ 4 billion			1
and yet they had just laid off another 30,000 people			0
now , why would you lay people off when you 're making a record profit of $ 4 billion ? i mean that was totally insane			0
but they thought , well , you know , we can make a bigger profit			0
maybe we can make $ 4.2 billion if we move those jobs to @entity230			0
and so they 're always , you know , we can make a little bit more money if we do this			2
by firing those workers , @entity19 , they got rid of the very people who buy their cars .			0
