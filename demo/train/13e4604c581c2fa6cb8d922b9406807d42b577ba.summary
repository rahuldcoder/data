@entity0 -- friday 's government report showing a rise in unemployment shines a light on a new hurdle facing young people in need of work : the military is n't the reliable source of employment that it used to be			1
the @entity13 and @entity14 are getting smaller , and now there 's a nearly year - long waiting list just to get into boot camp , no matter which branch you want to join			1
the shrinking @entity13 and @entity14 are part of a long - planned reduction in the size of the armed forces			1
but the backlog for enlistees is a new issue			2
incoming recruits will spend quite a bit of time before they see a @entity31 paycheck			0
" some may take a year or slightly longer , the typical new enlistee would probably be somewhere between 9 and 11 months , " @entity31 spokeswoman @entity32 wrote in an e-mail			0
a lot of it has to do with the economy			0
" in a tighter job market , young men and women may be more receptive to learning about the many opportunities the military has to offer , from competitive salaries and compensation packages , extraordinary education benefits , to valuable job skills and leadership training , " @entity32 said			1
it 's not just a tighter job market that has more people seeking to enlist			0
defending @entity51 pays better than it used to			0
" the average junior enlisted member , typically with just a high school degree , earns approximately $ 43,000 per year , " @entity32 said			2
and that does n't include benefits like free medical care and a government - paid retirement package that kicks in with 20 years of active - duty service			2
@entity32 said that since the war in @entity64 began , troop salaries and benefits have jumped significantly			0
" from 2002 - 2010 , military pay rose 42 % , housing allowances have risen 83 % , " she said			2
during the same time period , private - sector salaries rose 32 %			0
that , in some ways , is a good thing for the @entity31 , because it allows the services to choose the best possible candidates to defend our country			0
and the backlog helped former secretary of defense @entity77 end a controversial @entity13 program called stop - loss , in which soldiers were forced to stay in the @entity13 beyond their original enlistment dates in order to fill a personnel shortage			1
last month , @entity77 announced that no more soldiers are being stop - lossed			0
but for young people who ca n't , as hard as they try , find a job in the private sector , the backlog means the military is n't the solution they might have hoped for			1
for example , even if they get in , they may not get the kind of enlistment bonuses that troops got just a few years ago			1
for example , the @entity13 reports that " the average amount of bonus has gone down substantially over the past few years , " said @entity98 , a spokesman for the @entity13 's recruiting office			1
he said that in 2008 , the average bonus for @entity13 enlistees was more than $ 18,000			1
it was less than $ 6,000 last year			0
but the services still pay bonuses for hard - to - fill jobs			2
for example , in the @entity14 , " the more challenging the occupational field positions are to fill , the higher the bonus , " according to recruiting spokesman maj. @entity109			1
" currently , our cryptologic linguists and electronics maintenance technicians get the highest bonus offered at $ 10,000 , " he said			0
and do n't expect the situation to get much better , at least for the @entity13 and @entity14			1
both services are on a path to reduce the size of their active - duty forces starting next year			0
the @entity13 will shrink by about 22,000 people , the @entity14 by at least 15,000			1
all that means , if the economy does n't improve , would - be gis and leathernecks will be competing with just as many people for even fewer jobs in uniform .			2

the military is n't the reliable source of employment that it used to be
the @entity13 and @entity14 are getting smaller
average enlistment bonuses have also fallen
