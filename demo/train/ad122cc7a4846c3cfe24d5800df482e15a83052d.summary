join @entity0 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity2 at 11:10 a.m. wednesday			1
if you 're passionate about the topic , he wants to hear from you			0
@entity0 says the three presidential candidates will never be " regular folks			1
" ( @entity2 ) -- can we all just stop the silly nonsense over who is an elitist and whether an " average @entity10 " will occupy the @entity9 ? listening to the punditry today , you would think folks who revel in the comedy of @entity13 or @entity14 really would have a shot at the @entity9			1
so , sen. @entity19 is all of a sudden an elitist because he went to @entity20 and @entity21 ? and sen. @entity22 is an elitist because she went to @entity24 ? do you actually think sen. @entity25 is n't an elitist ? he went to an exclusive college -- the @entity27 , and that is one of the hardest places to get into			1
( you ca n't even apply unless a member of @entity32 recommends you			0
) @entity33 , who tries to portray himself as the common man but is just another rich @entity35 , has called both @entity37 candidates elitists			1
well , his former boss , president @entity38 , went to @entity24			0
so did @entity38 's dad , former president @entity40 , and his granddaddy , former sen. @entity42			1
all three @entity43 also were members of the super elite organization @entity44			0
the younger @entity38 later went to @entity21			0
he walked into the governor 's mansion and the presidency on the strength of his name and his dad 's money and connections			1
sounds like an elitist to me ! but no , we 're supposed to be fooled by the cowboy boots , folksy charm and him removing brush at his @entity61 , @entity62 , ranch ( do n't forget the family compound in @entity64 , @entity65 , where all the " regular " folks hang out )			0
surely you recall when @entity38 nominated @entity68 for the @entity69 ? those same conservative voices decrying the elitist @entity37 were blasting her because she went to little old @entity71 , that unremarkable -- their view -- university in @entity74 , @entity62			1
( by the way , that will be the home of the @entity78			0
) you can bet a pitcher of beer that had she graduated from @entity21 , @entity24 or @entity84 , she would n't have been derisively referred to as too plain and not educated enough by the elitists in the @entity35			1
and let 's stay with the @entity69 for a moment			1
where did its members go to school ? chief justice @entity92 -- undergrad and law school , @entity21			1
justice @entity95 -- undergrad : @entity96			1
justice @entity99 -- undergrad : @entity101 and the @entity102 , @entity103			1
justice @entity105 -- undergrad : @entity107 and the @entity108			2
justice @entity110 -- undergrad : @entity21 ; @entity112 ; @entity113			2
justice @entity115 -- undergrad : @entity117			2
justice @entity119 -- undergrad : @entity121			2
law school : @entity21 ( attended ) ; finished at @entity20			0
justice @entity123 -- @entity120 , @entity107 ; @entity112 , @entity113			2
justice @entity125 -- @entity126 : @entity84			2
that 's pretty much an elite list of schools			2
we have deluded ourselves into thinking the person elected to the @entity9 is really and truly like the rest of us			0
all three candidates do n't know what it 's like to face the daunting health care challenges millions of @entity10 are confronted with daily			1
each are members of the @entity139 , and they have the best health care money can buy for life -- we pay for it ! while your pension plan is shot to hell , their plan will never be underfunded			2
the members will see to that , courtesy of taxpayer dollars			0
forget how many times @entity19 bowls gutter balls , @entity151 tosses back shots of whiskey and @entity25 talks about how he 's a regular guy			2
each , courtesy of their $ 169,300 annual salary , makes far more than the average @entity10			2
and when it comes to wealth , @entity151 gets to enjoy the $ 100 million she and her husband raked in since he left the @entity9 ( even their hefty book advances dwarf regular authors )			0
@entity25 's wife , @entity164 , runs one of @entity167 's largest beer distributors and is worth more than $ 100 million			0
they will never be living paycheck - to - paycheck			0
@entity19 is the poorest of the three , but he did earn more than a million bucks courtesy of his best - selling books , " @entity172 " and " @entity173 " after delivering his 2004 keynote speech at the @entity175			0
how many average @entity10 would n't mind having a million dollars in their savings account ? bottom line : the narrative about our presidential candidates being just regular folks is a tired myth that gets repeated each and every day			1
and their efforts to show that they are " just like us " are really pathetic			1
you do n't have to go duck hunting , be seen buying milk at the grocery store for your family or having a beer at the local bar to show that you 're " one of us			0
" just do what rich and highly educated folks do when they are in politics : advance policies that will at least allow me to keep a few more dollars in my pocket and be able to afford a home			1
one more thing : do n't buy fully into the nonsense tossed out by some of the loudest voices on television , radio and in print who decry these " elitists " and trumpet that they are for the blue collar , middle - class worker in @entity213			0
many of them pull down multimillion - dollar salaries and run into these same candidates on @entity218 and in the @entity220 when they all vacation			1
they , too , will pull every favor they have to get their children in the posh private schools and @entity225 institutions			0
yes , we even have elitists in the media			0
who would 've thunkit ? e-mail to a friend			0

@entity0 : all three candidates are well - educated , wealthy -- not " average "
their efforts to show that they are " just like us " are pathetic , he says
but that 's ok , @entity0 says , if they advance good policies
