@entity0 -- the story has all the stuff that sells : a sexy starlet , a powerful enemy spy agency and lots of bare flesh			0
nude photographs of @entity10 actress @entity9 , published in the december issue of the @entity13 edition of the men 's magazine @entity14 prompted @entity16 to threaten a lawsuit			1
@entity16 said @entity14 doctored photographs to show her without clothes			1
the magazine , however , denied those allegations			2
@entity16 , editor @entity23 said , posed nude			1
what made the photos even more scandalous was that @entity16 's upper left arm bears the letters @entity27 , the acronym for @entity10 's powerful @entity27			1
in a legal notice served to the magazine , @entity16 contends that it was @entity23 's idea for her to wear the painted on @entity27 tattoo ; she was told t would be good for her image			1
and in another photo , which was originally slated for the cover , she is shown holding a grenade in her right hand			1
@entity14 published the grenade photo inside , with a line plastered across it : " the cover we did n't use			1
" @entity23 said the magazine opted not to use the photo on the cover because it " could have offended sensibilities			1
" but the magazine has already incensed @entity16			1
lawyer @entity50 told @entity1 that @entity16 is seeking $ 1.9 million in damages			1
@entity50 said the publication " cheated " his client and doctored the nude pictures			2
" proceedings ( in a court of law ) will begin soon , " he said			0
@entity58 , @entity50 said , violated its agreement with the @entity10 model that stipulated that @entity16 would be shown the photos from the shoot before they were published			1
" the pictures that are on display are tampered with , morphed and doctored , " he said			2
@entity50 did n't dispute the @entity27 print on @entity16 's left upper arm but said numerous organizations worldwide used the same acronym			1
he refused comment on the grenade - like object			2
@entity58 hinted at countersuing the actress			1
" these allegations are completely and entirely false			0
we are exploring various other options , including filing a countersuit , " @entity23 told @entity1			0
@entity16 said she never agreed to pose nude , the prospect of which sparked outrage in her homeland			1
" what i am doing takes a lot of guts , " she said			0
" if i had posed nude for the magazine , i would be the first to admit it			2
but i did n't agree to this and they are wrong			0
" i did not go for this , and i am deeply shocked and depressed about what has happened , " she said			0
but @entity16 is no stranger to controversy			2
she triggered uproar two years ago when she claimed that her former boyfriend , @entity10 cricketer @entity94 , was involved in spot - fixing international matches			0
@entity94 was found guilty last month in an @entity97 court			0
a year later , the actress came under fire from @entity10 clerics who decried her behavior in the @entity13 reality tv show " @entity103 , " as " un-islamic			0
" " i am not a perfect @entity104 or a perfect person , but i have n't committed a crime , and unfortunately things like this are part and parcel of the industry i work in , " @entity16 said			2
still , she downplayed her criticism back home			0
" i am not bothered about what they think , " she said			0
" my fans and many @entity10 support me and believe ( in ) me			0
" @entity118 reported from @entity0 and @entity119 reported from @entity120 , @entity10 .			0

the magazine , @entity58 , denies @entity9 's allegation
an attorney for @entity16 says nude photos in december issue were " doctored "
on cover , she holds what appears to be a grenade , has " @entity27 " written on her left arm
@entity16 's attorney says the actress is seeking $ 1.9 million in damages
