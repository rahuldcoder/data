@entity0 , @entity1 -- did @entity3 have time to think before he shot and killed his girlfriend @entity5 last year ? that 's the question that state prosecutor @entity7 dug into thursday with a doctor who has spent years working with the disabled athlete			1
" his intention was to shoot , whoever he came across -- if he came across anyone " in his home on a february night last year , @entity7 put to the doctor , @entity10			0
" i suppose if he came across an intruder or danger , he would shoot , " @entity10 responded			2
and @entity3 was firing to kill , the prosecutor said			1
@entity10 , a defense witness , paused a long time before he finally responded			2
" he was aiming to neutralize the threat , " the doctor said			0
@entity7 let those words hang in the air for a long moment before announcing that he was done with his questions for the day			0
@entity3 , 27 , is on trial for murder , and while he admits firing the bullets that killed @entity5 , he pleaded not guilty			1
he says he mistakenly thought he was defending himself from an intruder			2
the prosecution says the two had an argument and he deliberately murdered the model and law school graduate , who was 29			1
' @entity36 ' @entity10 spent all day thursday on the stand , first testifying under defense questioning that @entity3 ' double amputation is key to understanding his behavior			1
do not be taken in by the fact that @entity3 is one of the fastest runners in the world -- remember he is disabled , he argued			1
@entity10 ran through a long list of the difficulties that double amputees experience every day , concluding : " the saddest thing i have learned through my six years of working with athletes with disability is that disability never sleeps			2
" it 's there when you go to sleep at night and it 's there when you wake up in the morning			0
it affects nearly every aspect of your life , " he said			0
@entity3 ' defense team seems to be trying to establish that he acted reasonably , given who he is , when he killed @entity5 in the early hours of @entity61 2013			1
judge @entity62 must decide whether he made a genuine mistake and , if so , whether the mistake and his response were reasonable			0
the @entity67 's defense team has been exploring his psychology this week			1
his lawyer @entity69 posited thursday that there were " two @entity36 , " one of whom was a global sports star and one of whom was " vulnerable " and " scared			0
" " i am stuffed without my legs on , " his lawyer quoted him as saying , using a slang term meaning " in trouble			0
" witness reliability prosecutor @entity7 went after @entity10 aggressively in his cross-examination , exploring whether the shooting was an instinctive " fight - or - flight " response or the result of conscious thought			2
the question of whether @entity3 is found guilty of premeditated murder could hinge on the answer			1
exchanges between the two got testy , with @entity7 trying to get the doctor to explain @entity3 ' actions moment by moment on the night he killed @entity5			1
@entity10 said it was impossible for him to answer theoretical questions about what @entity3 might have been thinking or doing at a given instant because he , @entity10 , knew what had actually happened after the moment in question			1
frustrated , he appealed to @entity100 , but she sided with @entity7 , firmly instructing the witness to answer his questions or say he did n't know			0
@entity7 began his cross-examination by suggesting that @entity10 was not a trustworthy witness because he had a responsibility to @entity3 as his doctor			1
the prosecutor kept up the attack , demanding to know when @entity10 had made particular notes on @entity3 , whether the court should believe @entity10 or @entity3 when their evidence differed , and the meaning of the word " subsequent			1
" @entity10 grew irritated with @entity7 when the prosecutor responded : " that 's not true " to a statement @entity10 gave , and he appealed to the judge that @entity7 was being " unprofessional			0
" @entity62 agreed and ordered @entity7 to withdraw the remark			0
@entity7 , in turn , showed annoyance with @entity10 asking which " incident " he was referring to			0
" the killing ! " @entity7 shouted back at him			0
suicide risk the defense has been exploring @entity3 ' mental health for several days			1
on wednesday , his lead lawyer @entity125 said @entity3 is depressed , suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , and is a suicide risk , according to the doctors who spent a month evaluating his mental health			1
but he does not appear to have a history of abnormal aggression or psychopathic tendencies linked to " rage - type murders in intimate relations , " they found			0
the conclusions are a " slam - dunk for the defense , " @entity2 legal expert @entity136 said			0
the psychiatric report seemed to suggest that @entity3 ' version of events was plausible			2
" when mr. @entity3 's appraisal of the situation is that he might be physically threatened , a fear response follows that might seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of a normal bodied person , but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history , " the doctors found			2
several witnesses have testified that @entity3 tends to arm himself and go toward danger , rather than away from it , when he thinks he is under threat			2
at the trial 's conclusion , judge @entity62 will have to decide whether @entity3 , 27 , genuinely made a mistake or deliberately murdered his girlfriend			1
if @entity62 does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder , she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to a prison term ranging from 15 years to life			1
@entity1 does not have the death penalty			0
if @entity62 accepts that @entity3 did not know that @entity5 was the person he was shooting at , she could find him guilty of culpable homicide , a lesser charge than murder , or acquit him , according to @entity2 analyst @entity136			1
a verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at @entity62 's discretion			0
the trial is scheduled to continue monday for a 38th day			0
