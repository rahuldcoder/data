@entity0 -- when sen. @entity3 looks at the next two years , he says he is not concerned about the tough votes he is bound to have to make that could have an impact on his re-election in 2014			1
the moderate @entity9 from @entity10 even laughs a bit when he says , " every vote we take here is tough			2
" " my strategy has always been to do what i am going to do and focus on my issues , " @entity3 said in an interview with @entity1			1
@entity3 is one of six moderate democrats from " red " states whose terms ends in two years			1
@entity22 of @entity23 , @entity24 of @entity25 , @entity26 of @entity27 , @entity28 of @entity29 and @entity30 of @entity31 are among the 20 @entity19 whose terms will be up in 2014 ; republicans will defend 13 seats			1
@entity34 : complete results though no @entity36 has declared a run against @entity3 , speculation in @entity10 is that gov. @entity39 will challenge the first - term senator			1
since 2008 , when the former @entity42 mayor narrowly defeated incumbent @entity36 @entity43 , @entity3 has voted as a moderate and has shown willingness to work with the other party			1
at times , he says , that can get lonely : " you feel like a @entity49 sometimes			0
" asked about positions he has taken on oil and drilling or on transportation in the 112th @entity54 , @entity3 said , " sometimes i feel like i look around and i look behind me and there are n't many national democrats there			1
but that is the way it goes			0
" though fiscal cliff and budget issues are likely to dominate @entity54 ' lame duck session -- and likely the new @entity54 -- there are any number of issues that could emerge in president @entity67 's second term that could test moderate @entity19			0
much has been made of @entity19 @entity68 and @entity69 elected to the @entity70 last week and both parties being pulled away from the middle , but @entity3 points out that moderate democrats @entity73 of @entity75 and @entity76 of @entity77 also were elected			1
2014 battle for the @entity70 starts now @entity70 votes will be heavily scrutinized in midterms but @entity3 's optimism may not be well - founded -- the reality , says @entity83 from the @entity84 , is that even the most benign votes @entity3 and his fellow moderates make will be used against them in 2014			1
" senators that are up for re-election are up under a larger microscope			2
their votes will be dissected even more closely when they are in cycle , " @entity83 said			0
@entity93 of @entity94 fired a warning shot -- literally -- to his fellow @entity19 when the former governor was running against @entity36 businessman @entity97 in the special election to fill the remainder of the late sen. @entity101 's term			0
in a 30 - second statewide tv ad , @entity93 fired a bullet through a symbol of the @entity106 - passed cap - and - trade legislation -- a bill incredibly unpopular in his coal - rich state -- thereby both highlighting his opposition to the proposal and trumpeting his support of second amendment rights			0
democrats may also be emboldened by the way voters in some states last week supported @entity19 in the @entity70 even while voting for @entity36 presidential candidate @entity118			1
" we learned from tuesday 's results that voters are willing to split their tickets , " @entity83 said			0
in @entity77 , @entity125 and @entity75 , all states in which @entity118 outran @entity67 by more than 10 points , @entity19 won @entity70 seats			1
though ill - chosen comments on rape by @entity130 in @entity125 and @entity131 in @entity77 helped the @entity19 in each case , @entity28 's chief of staff , @entity127 , is encouraged			1
though she did not guarantee victory -- " i am not telling you that it is going to be easy			0
her races have never been easy , " @entity127 said -- she did sound confident			0
@entity28 " has run three times in a state that has always had a @entity36 lean , and her numbers have gone up every single time , " @entity127 said			1
every election " she has always been among the top targets and she has always shown the people of @entity29 and they have asked her to come back			1
" @entity127 noted the senator focuses on issues that her constituents care about , singling out protecting the state 's bayous , holding @entity150 oil company responsible for recovery from the 2010 @entity154 oil disaster , and education			2
new @entity157 house : women and minorities to the left ; white men to the right focusing on issues important to constituents @entity3 took the same tack -- listing issues like oil and natural gas , drilling in the @entity169 and transportation -- as his selling points to @entity173 voters			1
throughout the conversation he mentioned issues most democrats would n't touch , like auditing the @entity177 , strengthening gun rights and lowering the corporate tax rate			2
@entity3 's strategy seems clear -- focus on issues that matter to @entity10 for the last two years of his term			1
" i always run like i am 15 points behind			0
you always run hard , " @entity3 said			1
" i am focused in the last several years on the issues that matter to @entity10			0
" but how does that jibe with the wider @entity188 caucus ? when the 113th @entity54 is commenced in january , senate majority leader @entity189 will have to unite his caucus			2
with a mixed bag of priorities , and a handful of more moderate members focusing on getting re-elected in 2014 , that could prove taxing			0
" leader @entity189 has a difficult task and i think the president is going to be looking to define his legacy , " @entity197 said			0
" i think he is going to try to get something big done that is going to have political consequences			0
the ones who have the most on the line are the people who will face voters in the midterm			2
" @entity210 , who used to work as the chief spokesman for @entity189 , said he expects that the majority leader is going to go out of his way to make sure every @entity9 feels comfortable with each vote			0
" there are different ways to juggle votes , " @entity210 said			0
" in the end , @entity189 understands that they have to do what they have to do to get re-elected			0
@entity189 understands that they need to do what they have to do to represent their constituents			2
" after all , @entity210 pointed out , @entity189 has had to do this ever since becoming majority leader in 2006			0
" he spent the last couple of years juggling the competing concerns of ( moderates ) @entity232 and @entity233 against the demands of ( progressives ) @entity236 and @entity237			2
" @entity3 says he assured @entity189 before the 2012 elections that he is ready to take hard votes and that the leader does n't have to worry about putting him in a tough spot			2
even so , said a confident @entity3 , he likes where he is two years out from the election			2
" some of the guys who were running for re-election ( in 2012 ) had to moderate in my direction , " @entity3 said			1
" i came in with these positions already because that is who i am			0

with both parties being pulled away from the middle , @entity251 face *uphill* climb in ' 14
