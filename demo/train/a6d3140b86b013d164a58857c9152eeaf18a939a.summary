-- " i am a canvas of my experiences , my story is etched in lines and shading , and you can read it on my arms , my legs , my shoulders , and my stomach			0
" -- @entity12 , tattoo artist tattoos have come a long way			1
once lambasted as professional kryptonite and social sabotage , inked skin has now rooted itself in mainstream culture			1
in may , @entity20 / @entity19 released a poll that found 40 % of @entity22 have someone in their household with a tattoo , up from 21 % from 15 years ago			1
last year , @entity26 said tattoos were becoming " increasingly unproblematic across the board , " even in the workplace			1
but the workplace does n't seem to be ready for tattoos in certain areas -- mainly the face , head and neck			1
in 2011 , 31 % of employers nationwide told job website @entity37 that having a visible tattoo would hinder a candidate 's likelihood of being promoted			1
earlier this year , @entity42 670 - 1 enforced new rules prohibiting soldiers from displaying tattoos on the head , face , neck , wrists , hands and fingers			1
" tattoos are getting more and more accepted , " said @entity52 , a 24 - year old tattoo artist who has been inking clients full - time for six years in @entity54			1
" but we 're not there yet			0
" " people will start treating you differently once you become a heavily tattooed person , " said @entity52 , who has head and neck tattoos			1
potential employers , law enforcement and even landlords can look askance at facial tats , in her experience			1
" i just do n't think they 're for everybody , " she said			0
the accepted few of course when @entity52 says highly visible tattoos are not for everybody , she means everybody who wants a professional job			1
for years @entity22 society has openly accepted celebrities who choose to sport highly visible tattoos			1
boxer @entity79 , who had his face tattooed with a tribal symbol in 2003 , was an early adopter of the look			1
rapper @entity84 said he inked an ice cream cone on his cheek because he 's " cool as ice " and top - selling rap artist @entity87 has teardrops and " @entity89 " on his eyelids			1
neck tattoos can be seen on anyone from urban youths to international arbiters of style			1
@entity97 and @entity98 and @entity99 each have them			0
even @entity102 winner @entity101 appears to have gotten a tribal symbol permanently drawn on the back of his head			2
" tattooing has gone from being counterculture to being something everyone is doing , " @entity52 said			0
" but societal repercussions are still there , especially with highly visible tattoos on the face , neck or hands			1
" this is certainly true with nonfamous men and women			0
@entity121 rapper @entity120 was irate when a young fan followed the instructions from his song , " @entity125 , " and got a tattoo of his name on her forehead			2
and take @entity129 , the " @entity130 " who boasts a @entity133 fan page with more than 228,000 likes , but has had his teardrop tattoo photoshopped out of some internet memes			2
the teardrop , often associated with gang culture and violence , does not fit the high - fashion aesthetic of his dreamy blue eyes			0
perhaps our culture is more willing to overlook a criminal history than a conspicuous blotch of ink			0
anyone considering a facial tattoo should be warned about the repercussions , said @entity52 , the @entity54 tattooist			1
" if a tattoo artist is not giving a lecture on a face tattoo , they 're not doing their job			1
" @entity52 will ink clients ' faces only if they are already heavily tattooed -- and even then she will meet with them beforehand to ensure they have a clear understanding of the societal risks			0
but those who want them can still get face , head and neck tattoos without proper consultation and warning			1
in fact , some crude designs are done by nonprofessionals at home or in prison settings			0
" honestly , the tattoo community used to be very tight - knit , " she said			2
" but now you can buy kits off of @entity177 and call yourself a tattoo artist without any apprenticeship or traditional training			1
" ' i feel more like myself ' no amount of warning deterred @entity184			0
@entity185 , a 24 - year - old aspiring fashion model , spent years getting rejected from agencies because of his diminutive height			0
finally , he says , after a @entity191 modeling agency told him he 'd never get hired , he decided to make some changes to his appearance			0
@entity185 has more than 30 phrases tattooed on his body , including 12 across his face			2
they include words like fame , play , iconic face , sex , lick , @entity207 , and " the most famous			1
" he estimated that his tattoo plans were initially rejected by eight artists			2
" i know i 'm intense and i live my life to the fullest , " he said			0
" but now i do n't have to tell people ' this is who i am or these are my dreams			2
' " " now they can read it and they can see it			0
" sounds like @entity12 @entity185 thrives on the media attention he receives but still has not completed his dream of signing to a modeling agency			0
he works as a bagger in a @entity228 , @entity121 , grocery store			0
" i do n't get why people judge me , " he said			2
" people look at me , but no one will say anything			2
a lot of people think i 'm crazy			2
" people 's reactions , and @entity185 ' subsequent shock , come as no surprise to @entity239 , a @entity240 psychologist			2
" tattoo lovers are bold , often rebellious and extremely identified with their body ink , " he said			2
" they have a strong sense of identity and they have no intention of hiding			0
they are not scared of public opinion and would love to let others know what they believe in			0
" however , @entity239 , who wrote an article titled " @entity253 " for @entity254 , said this boldness does not necessary translate into comfort with one 's self , especially when it comes to highly visible tattoos			1
" tattoos on the upper body in a spot that 's not typically covered says someone does n't care what other people think -- but do n't mistake that for a healthy sense of individuality , " he said			1
" it 's more likely a sign of rebelliousness			0
" @entity239 and @entity52 urged individuals to think before they ink highly visible tattoos on the face , head , neck and hands , again citing mainstream exclusion			1
but @entity184 said he 's never felt more like himself			0
" for 10 months , i was wearing makeup to hide the tattoos and little by little i began to show more , " he said			2
" i am an artist and have always had the need to express myself , now i 'm just doing that on my skin			0
" @entity184 said he is very happy with his decision and loves the way he looks			0
he never felt a part of society , and now he has the face to match			0
