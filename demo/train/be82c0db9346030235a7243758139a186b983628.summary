-- what does a @entity2 airline still shaking off a dubious reputation have in common with one of the biggest football clubs in the world ? a match made in branding heaven if you 're the marketing men for @entity11 and @entity12			1
earlier this summer the @entity2 carrier signed a five year deal with the @entity16 champions to be the club 's official airline			1
if it raised a few eyebrows among fans around @entity22 who wondered if their team would be flying to their @entity25 fixtures via @entity26 , the view from @entity2 is that the deal means a great deal indeed			0
" @entity12 is one of the leading clubs in the world , with a fan base of 600 million , " said @entity11 's @entity29			1
" we share common values of teamwork and are both leaders in the market			0
" the airline might be a market leader in @entity2 , but it has a way to go before becoming a major international airline			0
yet the deal is just one instance of how much airlines are valuing alliances with successful sports teams			2
" @entity12 often talk about having hundreds of millions global fans , including 18 million in @entity2			2
( @entity11 ) are desperate for the traffic and to migrate some of those fans onto their planes , " said @entity49 , @entity51 's @entity50			2
according to @entity51 , @entity11 is the 19th most valuable airline brand , while @entity12 are second behind @entity56 on the company 's list of most valuable football clubs			1
with privileged access to players for airline promotions and pitch - side advertisements , @entity29 expects the airline to ally with the most eye - catching parts of @entity12			1
expect a @entity12 branded plane , tv spots with the likes of @entity69 and @entity70 in the not too distant future and their faces to loom large on @entity11 billboards around the world			1
go inside an @entity76 with @entity77 deals between airlines and football clubs are nothing new , but the size of the deals and scope of the partnerships have boomed in the last few years			2
most of @entity87 's top clubs have an official airline partner , while @entity89 this year broke its 113 - year tradition of having no corporate sponsor on the front of their shirt to display @entity95			1
extending these airline partnerships is a logical step for football clubs , says @entity49			0
" these days it 's more a question of why have n't all top ten @entity16 teams got an official airline , " he said			1
" there are cross-selling opportunities for both clubs and airlines and huge awareness opportunities for airlines			0
" the help in logistics for the clubs is one benefit of the deals			0
@entity12 were whisked around their pre-season tour of @entity115 on a private jet equipped with lie - flat business class seats , while rivals @entity118 have shirt sponsors @entity120 to help with the team 's travels			0
@entity123 entered into a deal with @entity126 carrier @entity125 last year to be the club 's official airline sponsor			1
@entity11 says it will offer @entity12 " strategic travel advice			2
" the real pay - off however comes from the boost in finances as clubs seek new way to grow revenue and reach emerging markets			0
@entity11 declined to say how much the deal with @entity12 was worth , but industry observers believe they out - bid @entity140 , the club 's previous airline sponsor , for an alliance with the club			1
if the @entity11 @entity12 deal seems slightly incongruous , it is perhaps because the biggest players in sponsorship deals have hitherto been the booming airlines from the @entity148 -- emirates , @entity95 and @entity120 -- with @entity149 a long - time supporter of sports teams , not just football , around the world			1
emirates aim for high - flyers with private jet service the @entity159 - based airline 's name can be seen on the shirts of some of the world 's best known teams -- @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 -- and it also boasts a sponsorship deal with @entity168			2
" emirates have a habit of sponsoring clubs when they open new routes , " said @entity49			0
" it can help them bring in promotions and advertise new routes			0
" @entity49 believes the number of deals and their value will only increase in years to come , as brand positioning and the desire to find new markets becoming more important for both football clubs and airlines			1
" when ( @entity186 airline ) @entity184 said it wanted to become a five - star airline , one of the first things it did was partner with a global brand , " he said			0
@entity193 , the @entity194 and @entity195 captain , can now be seen with other club players smiling at passengers on a @entity184 plane in one of the airline 's tv adverts			0
" airlines have realized that partnering with sports is the quickest way to make tag lines like @entity206 @entity95 ' ' globally yours ' a reality , " said @entity49 .			0

@entity11 became official airline of @entity12 earlier this summer
value of five - year deal was not *disclosed*
@entity140 increasingly seeing value in aligning their brand with football teams
both clubs and airlines look for new international markets and fans
