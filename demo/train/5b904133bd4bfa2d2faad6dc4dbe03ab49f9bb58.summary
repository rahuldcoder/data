just in time for @entity2 's birthday thursday , scientists delivered exciting news about how the universe works			0
last summer , physicists announced that they had identified a particle with characteristics of the elusive @entity8 , the so - called " @entity9 particle			1
" but , as often the case in science , they needed to do more research to be more certain			0
on thursday , scientists announced that the particle , detected at the @entity15 , the world 's most powerful particle - smasher , looks even more like the @entity8			1
the news came at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , from scientists at the @entity15 's @entity23 and @entity25 experiments			2
these two detectors are looking for unusual particles that slip into existence when subatomic particles crash into one another at high energies			0
" the preliminary results with the full 2012 data set are magnificent and to me it is clear that we are dealing with a @entity8 though we still have a long way to go to know what kind of @entity8 boson it is , " @entity32 , spokesperson for the @entity25 experiment , said in a statement			1
scientists have analyzed two and a half times more data than they had when the first announced the @entity8 results last july 4			2
the @entity8 is associated with the reason that everything in the universe -- from humans to planets to galaxies -- have mass. the particle is a component of something called the @entity8 , which permeates our universe			1
it 's not a perfect analogy , but @entity59 , theoretical physicist at @entity60 and " @entity62 " host , offered this comparison when i spoke with him last year : " you can think of it as a kind of molasses - like bath that 's invisible , but yet we 're all immersed within it , " @entity59 said			2
" and as particles like electrons try to move through the molasses - like bath , they experience a resistance			0
and that resistance is what we , in our big everyday world , think of as the mass of the electron			0
" the electron would have no mass if it were not for this " substance , " the field made of @entity8 particles			1
so , without the @entity8 , we would not be here at all			2
how particle smasher and telescopes relate many physicists hate the term " @entity9 particle " because it did not originate in the way you might think			2
@entity97 - winning physicist @entity96 wrote a book with " @entity8 " in the title , but reportedly said he 'd actually wanted to call it the " @entity101			1
" having evidence that the @entity8 really exists is important for the current understanding of how the universe works			1
an amazing fact about the @entity8 is that scientists predicted its existence and then detected it ( or something that strongly resembles it ) , rather than the other way around			0
they did n't see an abnormality and wonder what it was			0
the particle confirms notions about the universe that had only been calculated , but not directly observed			0
but scientists do not know if the particle they 've found is truly the one predicted by the @entity119 of particle physics			0
that model is the best explanation out there for what happens at scales smaller than the atom , but still has a lot of holes in it , and there are other theories out there that go beyond that model			0
it is possible that the @entity8 found at the @entity15 could fit into those other theories			1
to figure that out , scientists must look at how fast the boson decays into other particles , and see how the decay rate stacks up against predictions			0
the @entity15 is located in a 17 - mile tunnel near the @entity144 - @entity143 border , and is operated by @entity145 , the @entity146			1
the $ 10 billion particle - smasher set a record in 2012 for the amount of energy achieved in particle collisions : 8 trillion electron volts ( @entity153 )			1
the @entity15 shut down last month for a long staycation full of maintenance and upgrades			2
after about two years , it will come back online with 13 tev			1
detecting the @entity8 takes a lot of particle collisions -- there 's only one observed event in every trillion proton - proton collisions , @entity145 said			1
the @entity8 news coincides not only with @entity2 's birthday , but also with @entity165 , march 14			0
these events are not entirely unrelated : @entity32 told @entity167 last year that the number pi comes up in @entity15 calculations			2
for instance , scientists need to use pi when calculating how " loops " -- particles that transform themselves into other particles , and then come back together to make the original particle again -- contribute to a particle 's mass. more space and science news from @entity167 @entity182			0

an elusive particle discovered last year looks even more like the @entity8
higgs boson is linked to all mass in the universe
large @entity15 , which discovered particle , shut down for about 2 years
the particle - smasher will come back online at *unprecedented* energies
