@entity0 -- even a grainy three - month - old video clip can stir up a controversy			1
a closed - circuit television clip , posted and shared on @entity6 social media and reported by the local press this week , has triggered sympathy and outrage here in @entity6			1
the footage purportedly shows a four - year - old girl with autism being manhandled and beaten by a female assistant at a children 's rehabilitation center in the southern city of @entity18			1
the girl apparently collapsed and lost consciousness as other adults looked on passively			1
she was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment , @entity6 media reports said			1
watch : footage of disturbing incident @entity26 ( not her real name ) , an only child , has since undergone neurosurgery and is slowly recovering , a local @entity18 newspaper reported last week			2
she can sit but she ca n't stand yet , the newspaper said , and her speaking ability is still impaired			0
the assistant in the video has been charged with assault and battery , media reports said , though @entity1 has not yet been able to verify this			2
even though the incident happened three months ago , the newly uploaded video has sparked heated debate about the treatment of children -- particularly those with disabilities -- generating over 180,000 re-posts and 28,000 comments on one social media website alone			1
there is massive public outrage			2
critics condemned the teacher 's behavior , one calling it a " bestial act			0
" film actress @entity55 took to @entity57 , @entity6 's @entity58 - like service , to say , " this kind of behavior should be charged with intentional homicide			1
autistic kids are extra vulnerable because they are unable to independently control their behavior			0
we as parents will be closely watching how ( the teacher ) will be punished in court			0
" another @entity57 user , named @ @entity69 , asked , " does n't she have a child herself ? how on earth could kindergarten teachers be so cold - blooded ? who would dare entrust their kids to these peoples ' hands ? " other netizens blame the lack of trained teachers , especially for children with autism and other disabilities			1
" this is heart - wrenching , " posted @ alwaysyouyou			1
" and why were all the other teachers just standing there watching ? i 'm deeply worried about how teachers get their qualifications nowadays			0
" still others question how @entity6 children are reared and educated			1
@entity93 , a writer of children 's books , wrote on his microblog : " parents make so much effort to secure a slot for their kids in the kindergarten , but do they know what 's happening behind closed doors once they get in ? " when i was in kindergarten , a kid accidentally dropped his bowl while eating			2
the teacher asked all other kids to take turns to slap him			0
" like many places around the world , @entity6 teachers and parents do resort to corporal punishment at times to discipline misbehaving children			1
but no one is defending the brutal treatment of @entity26			2
" surely it must be severely punished , " wrote @entity118 , a commentator at @entity119 ( @entity119 ) in a microblog post			0
" the kindergarten and its supervisors must be held responsible too			0
" " @entity124 should be more thoughtful in the way they discipline students			0
no matter what , corporal punishment in public will harm the students ' self - esteem for sure , " said @entity128 , director of the @entity129			2
@entity26 's maltreatment has also put the spotlight on the plight of autistic children in @entity6			1
prevalence of autism in the world 's most populous country , experts say , is largely underestimated because many @entity6 doctors , parents and teachers typically do not know enough about the condition to be able to identify and diagnose it			1
though awareness is growing and early intervention is improving , the social stigma remains strong			0
read : what is autism ? autism in @entity6 is known as " zibizheng , " literally " self - isolation syndrome , " or loneliness disease			1
it 's a feeling shared by the parents of autistic children			0
" i feel depressed and helpless i do n't know how to deal with this , " said @entity161 in an interview with @entity1			0
he said sometimes it seems his daughter barely knows he 's there but the loving father said he is always there			0
he does not dare leave her side			0
@entity161 brought his daughter to a special center for autistic children on the outskirts of @entity0			0
there , some 30 children , from toddlers to five and six years old , get specialized one - on - one care			1
teachers use music and animal therapy to help unlock what could be inside the children 's world			0
but these facilities are rare in @entity6 and parents and teachers complain of a lack of such facilities			2
the government helps subsidize the center , but parents still need to pay a lot of money for their children 's special education			0
@entity161 pays the equivalent of $ 500 a month -- almost his entire monthly salary			0
autism is @entity6 's number one mental disorder , according to a research paper presented at the @entity201 in @entity202 last year			1
yet a recent survey by the @entity204 in southern @entity6 reveals an alarming lack of professional or government support			2
the brutal treatment of four - year - old @entity26 , shockingly captured in that grainy closed - circuit television clip , is a grim reminder of that .			1

footage purportedly shows four - year - old girl with autism being manhandled and beaten
the girl apparently collapsed and lost consciousness as other adults looked on
caused outrage among @entity6 netizens after video has been posted on the internet
much concern about the treatment of children , especially those with mental disabilities
