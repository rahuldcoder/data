-- in the chaotic weeks during @entity3 's revolution , thousands of inmates escaped from jail			1
untold hundreds among them were @entity8 militants			1
many more detained for belonging to jihadist groups have been released from detention in the 18 months since president @entity11 was ousted -- and the activities of some are beginning to cause serious concern to @entity3 and @entity16 intelligence agencies			1
@entity17 , 48 , was one of those released			0
a heavyset , bearded man , @entity17 was raised in the poor and crowded @entity21 suburb of @entity22			0
he joined @entity3 @entity23 as a young man and spent time in @entity27 training mujahedeen and in @entity28 in the 1990s -- before being jailed when he returned to @entity3 in 2002			1
he spent the next nine years in detention but appears never to have faced a trial			0
former jihadists who knew him describe him as " ultra-radical , " according to @entity34 of the @entity35 , who has spoken with former senior members of @entity37 in @entity21			2
just what @entity17 may be doing now goes to the heart of the dilemma facing counterterrorism agencies in the @entity43 world and the @entity44 : of the thousands of @entity8 militants now back in circulation in the wake of the @entity43 revolutions -- who is taking up arms again in the cause of global jihad ? the @entity52 reported tuesday that @entity17 is suspected of a role in the attack on the @entity56 @entity55 in @entity57 on september 11			1
the @entity52 quoted a former @entity56 official as saying that intelligence reports suggested some of the attackers trained at camps @entity17 established in the @entity63			0
" mr. @entity17 , although believed to be one of the most potent of the new militant operatives emerging from the chaos of the @entity68 , is n't the only one , according to @entity16 officials , " the article continued			0
like many former jihadists now out of @entity3 jails , @entity17 is difficult to trace			1
there is no clear evidence that he has spent time in @entity76 or is still there , though the long desert border would make a crossing relatively straightforward			0
former comrades insist he is in @entity21 , studying for his master 's degree in @entity23 law			2
@entity82 , a founding member of @entity37 , told @entity0 that @entity17 had been a fierce fighter			0
but he added : " i last saw him three months ago but he had no announced intentions of jihad and informed me that he is staying in @entity3 and was determined to finish his studies			1
" " like many jihadists who were against @entity87 killing his own people , he may have communicated with rebels in @entity76 during the revolution , " @entity82 said			1
@entity91 , a prominent lawyer in @entity21 who has represented jihadists in court , told @entity0 : " i have been contacted by different foreign government agencies requesting information about him			1
" and @entity98 ( brother of @entity100 leader @entity99 and a former member of @entity23 himself ) told @entity0 wednesday that @entity17 was definitely in @entity21			0
but keeping track of the activities and intentions of former jihadists -- many of whom have stayed in touch with each other since being released -- is no easy task			1
in may 2011 , @entity3 's interior minister , @entity111 , told @entity0 that around 23,000 prisoners had escaped during the collapse of the @entity11 regime ( though they included many common criminals ) , and only some 7,000 had been apprehended			1
the new @entity117 government has granted pardons to dozens more jihadists , some of whom had been held in " administrative detention " by the @entity11 government without ever seeing a courtroom			1
last month , @entity125 -- a prominent member of @entity126 -- was freed			0
he had been implicated in the slaughter of foreign tourists in @entity129 in 1997 , when some 60 people were gunned down and then mutilated			0
@entity125 was also implicated in the attempted assassination of @entity11 in 1995			1
he was extradited to @entity3 from @entity132 eight years ago			1
of those released , some -- like @entity134 -- have taken up roles as mediators between the government and jihadist cells that have emerged in the volatile @entity140			2
with the blessing of president @entity142 , @entity134 met with religious and tribal leaders in the @entity140 town of @entity145 in august -- in an effort to prevent further attacks on security forces by groups such as @entity150 in the @entity140			0
" we believe there is a conspiracy to damage the reputation of the @entity159 through attacks like these , " he said in remarks quoted by @entity153 , a @entity154 newspaper			0
@entity162 , a former @entity163 member , says the situation in @entity140 is the most alarming facing the government			2
attacks by militants on police posts have killed dozens of members of the security forces , and there have been several attempts by militant cells to cross into @entity174			1
last month militants carrying black flags ( often associated with @entity100 ) invaded a @entity179 peacekeepers ' base in the @entity140			2
another of those released , @entity180 , who was convicted in 1981 of involvement in the assassination of president @entity184 , has founded the political wing of @entity163 , the @entity186			0
other militants , such as @entity98 , also appear to have embraced the new political process in @entity3			1
he demands @entity3 become an @entity23 republic under sharia law , but does not espouse violence			1
last month , @entity99 presented @entity0 with a manifesto for a truce between @entity100 and the @entity44 , though he says he has not seen his brother since 1996			0
the @entity3 government 's ability to track militants back in circulation has been dramatically impaired since @entity11 's fall			1
the @entity200 was disbanded , to be replaced by another agency called @entity202			0
hundreds of senior police officers were sacked ; thousands of security files vanished or were burned			0
compounding a sense of general insecurity , the @entity63 revolution released a flow of weapons across the border , many of which ended up in @entity140			2
according to @entity3 security sources , these have included antiaircraft missiles			1
in addition , @entity217 counterterrorism officials are concerned that @entity21 has become an easy destination for @entity16 bent on jihad			0
they say a number of militants have left @entity217 for @entity21 in recent months ; some are going to @entity21 to transit to @entity225 and other fronts			2
@entity3 's president draws much of his support from religious conservatives and @entity230 , and is anxious not to be seen as using @entity11 - era tactics against @entity8 radicals			1
@entity142 also has called very publicly for the release from jail in the @entity56 of @entity235 , the blind sheikh convicted of playing a role in the first attack on the @entity238 in 1993			2
@entity235 is known as the ' godfather ' of @entity37			0
@entity98 insists the fuss over @entity17 and other jihadists is misplaced and exaggerated			2
" i think the @entity56 is once again trying to create a new bogeyman and are giving him a much higher status than he deserves			0
the media and certain governments will try to prove that the release of @entity159 after the revolution was a mistake			2
but it is only justice served , " he told @entity0			0
whatever the merits of the release program , @entity16 counterterrorism agencies fear the law of unintended consequences may apply .			0

@entity259 numbers of @entity8 jihadists escaped prison during @entity3 's revolution
one of them , @entity265 , is suspected in the @entity57 attack
@entity11 's fall impaired @entity3 's ability to track at - large militants
@entity117 government has granted pardons to dozens more jihadists
