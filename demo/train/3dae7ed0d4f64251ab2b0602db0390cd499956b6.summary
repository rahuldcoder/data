-- as one of the warmest cities in @entity3 -- a country with no shortage of snowy terrain -- @entity7 seems an unusual place to host the @entity9			1
but that 's not all that 's notable about it			0
it 's also the latest hot spot for dacha - seeking oligarchs -- and president @entity16			1
plus it has gay bars ( despite president @entity16 )			1
not necessarily in the gay bars , though			1
anyone who 's anyone ( or who can afford it ) has a dacha there the infamous @entity3 who put the " @entity31 " city on the map was n't quite the hair - shirted leader you might expect			2
communist dictator @entity33 popularized @entity7 after building a summer dacha -- @entity3 vacation home -- here in the 1930s			1
in the years since , the destination has become a summering spot for a succession of @entity3 politicos -- all the way up to president @entity16 , who has two dachas in @entity7			1
@entity7 dachas have also become increasingly in demand from the ultra-rich so - called oligarchs who divided up much of the @entity3 economy among themselves with the downfall of the @entity50			1
the popularity of the resort among the wealthy and powerful has led to criticisms that it 's become unaffordable to the ordinary @entity3 who flocked to the city after its establishment as a vacation spot in the 1950s			2
you can tour the dacha that launched the locale , complete with a wax version of the " @entity62 , " avuncular pipe in hand			0
@entity33 's @entity65 , @entity66 120 , @entity67 ; +7 ( 862 ) 267 05 02 ; tours - $ 10 -- by appointment 2			2
the @entity70 are n't actually happening in @entity7 the @entity70 are n't taking place in @entity7 proper , which technically consists of one 32 - square - kilometer district called @entity74			2
instead , athletes are competing in @entity76 , an area within @entity7 just north of @entity79 's breakaway territory , @entity80			2
a coastal cluster of venues south of @entity7 proper house the @entity84 and rink sports including ice hockey , curling and figure skating			0
outdoor events such as skiing and bobsleighing are being hosted within the @entity92 resort area , about 50 kilometers away in the @entity93			0
restaurants and bars will be smoke - free in @entity3 , you 're never far from a cigarette lighter			1
back in october , that was a lucky strike for the @entity9 when a man whipped one from his pocket and quickly replenished the @entity70 flame , which had blown out in the wind			0
but the @entity70 have committed to a smoke - free event , making it the 12th @entity105 to do so			2
this will be a trial in a country still in love with smoking -- nearly 60 % of adult males and 40 % of the total adult population admitted to smoking regularly in 2012 , according to the @entity114			0
the sale of cigarettes and smoking itself have been banned inside any @entity70 venue , with the exception of specially marked smoke zones			0
smoking is also forbidden at bars and restaurants within the @entity123 -- a step ahead of the nation			0
@entity3 barred smoking in public spaces including airports and train stations last june , and will expand the ban to include @entity131 © s , bars and restaurants in june 2014			2
it will also impose a minimum price ( so long $ 2 packs ) , all in an effort to quell smoking - related deaths in @entity3 , which totaled 400,000 in 2012			2
@entity7 has gay bars there are no gay people in @entity7 , according to mayor @entity142			1
curiously enough , however , there are gay bars -- at least one that 's out of the closet , that is			1
@entity7 's @entity147 , catering to both gay and straight clients , features a midnight show by transvestite cabaret singers			2
despite homosexuality being a federal crime in @entity3 until 1993 , @entity7 was a gay hub during @entity50 times for its relaxed beachfront vibe and distance from major metropolises within the @entity157			1
in july , president @entity16 signed into law a ban on " gay propaganda , " criminalizing the spread of information on " nontraditional sexual relations " among minors			2
he 's since lowered his sword , saying gay people will be welcome at the 2014 @entity105 but adding in a january 17 comment to a group of @entity70 volunteers : " please leave the children at peace			2

@entity7 trained @entity3 's first space monkeys it 's a symbol of the 1960s @entity179 space race etched into our collective imagination : a monkey , in full astronaut attire , manning a spacecraft			1
leading the way in @entity3 's monkey - manned space technology ? @entity7 , of course			1
@entity3 's first space monkeys , @entity190 and @entity191 , were trained at a @entity7 " apery " for their seven - day mission in december of 1983			1
the @entity194 ( @entity195 1 , @entity76 ; + 7 ( 862 ) 241 62 39 ; call for tours -- $ 7 ) is open to visitors curious to tour the training and testing facility , or just hang with 2,700 apes			0
cossacks patrol the streets their tall lamb 's wool hats , emblazoned coats and flamboyant dance style have earned cossacks a place in the world 's vision of @entity3 , with help from @entity3 literary icons @entity213 and @entity214			1
now , the once feared horsemen who secured the frontier for @entity3 tsars have joined forces with police patrolling @entity7			1
@entity3 and the @entity19 have a patchy history			0
after centuries as allies of @entity3 , the east @entity222 people suffered harshly under the communists for their opposition to the @entity227			0
but since the collapse of the @entity50 , cossacks have gradually returned to popular favor in @entity3			2
echoing the mid- 19th - century @entity231 when @entity19 served as border guards , current governor @entity233 of @entity7 's @entity235 region hired a thousand fur - clad @entity19 to help to secure the @entity105			1
cossacks make up only a small fraction of the approximately 40,000 security forces at the @entity9			0
it might not be vodka in that shot glass @entity3 's toasting rules are complicated			1
what , or whom , to toast changes with each clink , but one constant remains : vodka			0
in @entity7 , however , vodka is often swapped for its fruitier @entity250 counterpart , chacha , a @entity79 pomace brandy , often distilled like moonshine ( so if you aim to taste , you 're advised to look for safer , bottled varieties )			1
similar to @entity257 grappa , chacha takes on the flavor of the grape skins and walnut shells often infused with the liquor			0
@entity79 lore claims chacha has healing qualities , easing earaches and indigestion			0
the cuisine may be @entity269 and @entity79 @entity7 , which underwent multi-ethnic colonization in the 19th century , may technically be all - @entity3 now , but its food remains diverse			1
with @entity269 accounting for 20 % of the city 's population , and close proximity to @entity79 , @entity7 offers an impressive sampling of cuisine beyond the dill and sour cream of traditional @entity3 fare			1
you 'll find authentic @entity282 at kitschy @entity283 ( @entity285 ul. 15 , @entity76 ; +7 ( 862 ) 295 51 21 ; open daily , year round ) part of the largest private museum of @entity250 artifacts and history			0

the @entity309 and @entity310 grove -- the biosphere spot most easily accessible from @entity7 -- features 1,000 - year - old trees and plant relics from prehistoric times			1
