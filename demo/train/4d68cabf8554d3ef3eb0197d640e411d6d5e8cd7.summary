@entity0 -- @entity3 lt. col. @entity2 hugged his wife , @entity4 , goodbye and headed out for his two - day mission			1
the date was january 12 , and the destination was @entity8			1
neither knew it would be the last time they 'd see one another			2
upon his arrival in @entity13 , @entity2 sent his wife an e-mail saying he had settled into his hotel room			1
ten minutes later , @entity17 and the couple 's three sons began watching television back in their suburban @entity21 , @entity23 , home			1
that 's when the news broke : @entity8 had been struck by a major earthquake			1
she describes the panic that set in			2
" i sent him another e-mail , you know , ' please tell me you 're ok ' , " she recounted to @entity1			0
" and , at that point , i did n't get anything back			0
" the ensuing minutes and hours turned to days of waiting			0
" it was painful not knowing , " she said			0
" but not knowing , you still had hope			0
you still had hope that he could possibly be under there just surviving , just doing everything he could to survive			0
" eventually , @entity17 began to fear the worst			1
lt. col. @entity2 worked at the @entity46 desk at the @entity47			1
his job involved helping the @entity8 military with security issues concerning both countries , such as combating illicit drug trafficking , uncovering money laundering and distributing humanitarian aid			1
@entity2 had been to @entity8 previously , and this trip was to be a 48 - hour mission escorting a new commander to meet his @entity8 counterparts			1
his e-mail to his wife of five years was titled , " wow			2
" " he actually had seen what true poverty was			0
and it was a life - changing experience for him , " @entity17 recalled			1
" and he said that he wished that my son , chance , and i could have been there to see it			0
i could tell from his e-mail he was moved , beyond words , at what he 'd seen , " she said			0
army lt. col. @entity70 worked with @entity2 at @entity47			1
the two traveled to @entity8 together and were in their respective rooms at the @entity73 when it came crashing down			1
" we arrived tuesday morning , met with the ambassador at the embassy , and got briefings , " @entity70 told @entity1 in an interview at @entity47 's headquarters in @entity77 , @entity23			2
" @entity2 and myself then went back to the @entity73 , and that was the last time i saw him , " @entity70 said			1
@entity70 stayed on the hotel 's top story , in a fifth - floor corner room			1
@entity2 's room was on the second floor			1
@entity70 recalled the horrible events of that afternoon			0
" i was standing in the middle of the room , and the building just erupted , " he said			0
" the room just shook so violently , and the noise was deafening , " he said			0
" i rushed to the door , and the door and the wall fell on top of me			0
as the building pancaked , i guess i rode it down			0
" @entity70 suffered a broken arm , a separated shoulder and a torn ligament in his knee			0
but in the immediate aftermath of the quake , no word from @entity107			2
after two weeks , @entity17 was emotionally exhausted from waiting and worrying			1
she took a military plane to @entity8 to stand near where her husband was last seen alive			1
" i just felt like , if that was going to be where he took his last breath , that i owed it to him and our kids to be there , to see it , to pray for him , " she said			0
once she got back home , she continued to wait for word about her husband 's fate			2
eventually , " they called , " she said , tearfully recalling the moment when she got the definitive word that her husband had died in the earthquake - ravaged @entity73			1
immediately following the phone call , she worried , " oh my gosh , how am i gon na make it through this ? what am i gon na tell my boys ? you know , how am i going to explain this to them ? " @entity2 served in @entity135 in 2004			2
his safe return there holds a certain irony for his wife			2
" to make it home from a real war zone , and be taken like that			0
it 's just ... it 's hard , " she said			2
" he was honest , confident , " she said of her late husband			2
' he was very dedicated			0
" @entity17 is unsure of " where i go from here			1
it 's still just kind of , every day i get up , take a deep breath and ask , ' how are we gon na get through today ? what are we gon na do ' , " she wonders			2
" never , never ever would i be prepared for this			0
" " it 's so vivid in my mind , him giving me a hug , kissing the boys , " @entity17 said			1
" i still see him walking out the door sunday on his trip			0
and you know , ' bye ! see you when i get back			0
love you ! love you , too ! ' " asked about the necklace she wears , she said , " this is @entity2 's wedding band , one of the things they identified him with			1
i wear it around my neck , to keep him close to my heart , always			0
