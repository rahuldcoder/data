-- sens. @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 really want us to believe that their shameful behavior toward @entity8 ambassador @entity7 is all about getting to the truth about what happened in @entity11 , but the truth is that this is the first salvo in a @entity14 war against president @entity15 over the next four years			1
do they think @entity16 are dumb enough to believe that @entity17 , who had no responsibility over intelligence or approving security requests at the @entity21 , is the main person who should be answering their queries over what happened in @entity24 that led to the deaths of four @entity16 , including ambassador @entity27 ? these three continue to assert that @entity17 should have known better than to read talking points on several sunday morning shows provided to her by the intelligence community , as well as provide an assessment that went outside of what she was told			1
is it fair that she be asked about those talking points ? of course			0
but to somehow try to pin the blame on her is downright offensive			0
it has been amazing to watch the degree to which @entity16 senators do n't want to criticize secretary of state @entity44 , who has jurisdiction over the department			1
yes , @entity47 , and not @entity17 , oversees @entity16 ambassadors across the world , and it is her department that denied the security requests from @entity27			2
if there is anyone who should be answering questions about security of our consulate in @entity11 , it 's @entity47			0
instead , it 's all @entity17 , all day			2
@entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 also want to know why the intelligence was so botched , so what do they do ? try to pin that on @entity17 as well			2
again , it has been stunning to see the degree in which members of @entity69 are afraid to even utter @entity71 ' name , as if vigorously questioning the assessment of the @entity73 , which he ran before a sex scandal forced him to resign , is off limits			0
if @entity14 senators are demanding intelligence answers , then they should continue to haul leaders of various agencies down to @entity69 to testify under oath			1
instead , they 've made the calculation to turn @entity17 into their @entity84 , desperate to scuttle a potential secretary of state nomination			1
what finally took the cake was seeing @entity90 @entity89 sen. @entity89 raise questions about @entity17 and the handling of the 1998 embassy bombings in @entity94			2
seriously ? now they are trying to pin those bombings on @entity17 ? this has turned into a charade that is shameless , pathetic and embarrassing			2
now it 's @entity15 's turn to play hardball and make clear to the @entity14 that he wo n't get pushed around with his appointees in his second term			1
after january 1 , he should make clear to the nation that he is going to appoint the eminently qualified @entity17 to be his secretary of state , and dare the @entity106 to deny him his pick			1
the president should send an unmistakable signal to the @entity14 that he wo n't be bullied by anyone			1
he forcefully defended @entity17 in a news conference a week ago and publicly thanked her at this week 's @entity114 meeting , but the ultimate sign of confidence -- and strength -- would mean forgoing the easy pick of @entity16 sen. @entity119 and daring them to stop @entity17			1
@entity15 should n't be afraid to engage in a public battle with the @entity14			1
to heck with the naysayers who say @entity17 is damaged goods			0
what 's damaged is the logic of @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity126 , who look foolish every day with their remarks about @entity17			0
and before him , @entity2			0
now it 's time for the president to make clear he has no plans to be an idle bystander in another attack on a member of his @entity114			0
mr. president , it 's clear the @entity14 is itching for a fight going into the new year			2
so give it to them			0
and show them who is boss			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			0

@entity14 senators are criticizing @entity7 for her comments about @entity24 attack
@entity146 says the focus on @entity17 is unwarranted given her limited role on issue
he says president @entity15 should defy critics , pick @entity17 to be secretary of state
@entity146 : president should show that he ca n't be bullied by *republicans*
