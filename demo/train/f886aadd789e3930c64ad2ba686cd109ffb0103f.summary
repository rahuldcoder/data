@entity0 , @entity1 -- in three debates by the presidential candidates and one by the vice-presidential hopefuls , no one could bring himself to utter the words " climate change			1
" @entity9 said what all four @entity11 contenders were afraid to say			1
i 've heard that some voters are undecided			1
watching the debates , i became undecided over what 's worse : republicans , who not only do n't acknowledge reality , but who genuinely seem not to believe reality			1
or @entity21 , cowed into silence on issues of enormous importance like climate change and its solution : clean renewable energy			1
@entity9 said things no candidate in @entity30 could voice without blowing away their own political career			1
she said : " enough ! wake up			2
and if you do n't get it , it will get you ; then you 'll get it			1
" now , we got it			2
@entity9 is probably the first storm to change an ongoing presidential campaign			1
@entity42 changed the shape of a campaign to come , contributing significantly to @entity46 's unpopularity and tarnishing his legacy ( " @entity51 job , @entity52 " ) with lingering images of unpreparedness			1
but unpreparedness requires , one might say , quite a lot of preparation			2
we build in places prone to flooding			2
we do that largely because subsidies encourage it			2
federal flood insurance is a way the entire country subsidizes building and rebuilding in places destined for repeated hits			1
we rely on overhead lines to bring electricity , lines vulnerable to falling trees			2
and when they fall , we put them right back			0
underground lines are more expensive			0
but if you have to keep repairing the overhead lines ... news : marshes and malls -- migration to @entity30 coast heightens impact of storms we 've created coastal bowling - pin communities ; we set ' em up and the weather takes ' em down			1
in my defense , i 'll claim entrapment , because i have federal flood insurance			1
you made me do it			0
so i just want to take this opportunity to thank you			0
but i 'd like to also tell you , it 's ok with me if you withdraw your generosity			0
in fact it would be better if you did			0
you help make us lazy			0
and by us , i mean millions of people living along the coast , whistling in the dark			0
and you help our politicians look away from the oncoming truth			0
they 've been rising since the last ice age and that rise has been accelerating since the @entity107			1
we 've had fair and continual and increasing warning			1
and yet , small coastal communities and cities as large as @entity111 have done essentially nothing to prepare			0
over decades , we filled many wetlands that are the natural buffers to floods			0
shrinking the area of our wetlands has left adjacent areas more prone to flooding			2
as the world continues warming , the warming tends to intensify storms			0
@entity111 has been hit with two hurricanes in two years			0
and since at least @entity42 , scientists have warned that hurricanes take their strength from the heat of the ocean 's surface			0
opinion : climate change is real @entity134 € ” and being an independentâ € ” has given @entity111 mayor @entity136 the political cover to simply repeat what @entity9 herself has so loudly said : " global warming			1
" now @entity142 gov. @entity141 is joining in , too , telling @entity145 's " science friday " host @entity143 on november 2 that , " i 've been talking about global warming for years			2
" but was @entity9 just a hurricane , or an angrier child spawned of unusually warm ocean waters ? in one sense , it does n't quite matter			1
@entity153 cast it colorfully in his @entity156 column , saying , " when the public asks , ' did climate change cause this ? ' they are asking a confused question			1
it 's like asking , ' did steroids cause the home run @entity165 hit on may 12 , 2006 ? ' there 's no way to know whether @entity165 would have hit the home run without steroids			0
but who cares ? steroids mean more home runs			0
" these questions remain : will the storms that come our way get stronger , more damaging ? will we experience more frequent damage from storms ? we 'd better prepare ourselves for the answers to be yes			0
that 's because , even if the answer is no , this storm , like last year 's , exposed the @entity186 's soft underbelly and our recklessly erected vulnerability			2
you tell me what we can expect			0
news : experts warn of superstorm era to come so , was the storm caused by global warming ? soon we 'll have a more interesting question : was the outcome of the presidential election caused by global warming ? did global warming affect the course of human events enough to make a difference in what we say , in what we think , in how we free our politicians to decide what they can do next ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1

@entity217 : presidential candidates afraid to talk of impact of climate change
@entity9 may be first storm that could change an ongoing presidential campaign , he says
federal flood insurance enables *development* in *environmentally* *threatened* areas , he says
@entity217 : we 've had warnings before , but have n't acted to deal with rising sea level
