hands down , it 's the most important monthly economic report in the race for the @entity2			1
and april 's numbers from the @entity4 did n't provide president @entity5 a lot to brag about			1
" after the worst economic crisis since the @entity10 , our businesses have now created more than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months , more than 1 million jobs in the six months alone			0
so that 's the good news , " @entity5 said friday at an event in northern @entity13			2
but the president went on to say , " there are still a lot of folks out of work , which means we got ta do more			1
if we 're going to recover all the jobs lost during the recession , and if we 're going to build a secure economy that strengthens the middle class , then we 're going to have to do more			0
" consider this : no sitting president facing an unemployment rate more than 8 % has won another term since @entity29			0
so the headline from the @entity4 report friday morning that the nation 's unemployment level edged down from 8.2 % in march to 8.1 % in april sure seemed like good news for an incumbent president fighting for re-election			0
especially since just about every poll indicates that the economy remains the top issue on the minds of @entity41 and that jobs remain the top economic concern			1
@entity44 : why @entity5 ca n't match the @entity46 recovery but the @entity4 also reported that the number of jobs rose last month by 115,000 , much lower than many economists had predicted			2
according to the report , 342,000 workers dropped out of the labor force , with the labor force participation rate , now at 63.6 % , at its lowest level since 1981			0
the presumptive @entity56 presidential nominee was quick to react to the jobs numbers			0
" it 's a terrible and very disappointing report this morning			1
clearly the @entity41 people are wondering why this recovery is n't happening faster , what 's taking years and years for the recovery to occur			2
and we seem to be slowing down , not speeding up			0
this is not progress , " @entity64 said friday in an interview on @entity66 just minutes after the 8:30 a.m. et release of the @entity4 report			2
@entity64 says no celebration until 4 % unemployment rate " a lot of @entity41 people are having difficult times , and this is not good news this morning , " added the former @entity74 governor , who argued the reason the rate dropped was because more people are leaving the workforce			1
republicans quick to react to jobs report @entity64 's strategy is simple : make the election a referendum on the president 's record on the economy and jobs , and argue that @entity5 is n't doing a good job on creating jobs			1
with six months to go until @entity95 , a top @entity56 strategist says the jobs report spells trouble for the president			1
" a disappointing jobs report means two things : one , president @entity5 is more likely to lose his job			1
now , this election will increasingly become a referendum on @entity5 's performance			2
voters may or may not believe @entity64 can turn things around , but it is becoming clearer that @entity5 's plan is n't going to cut it , " says @entity56 strategist and @entity108 contributor @entity106			1
" two , to win , president @entity5 has to run the most brutal , negative , polarizing campaign in history -- on every subject but the economy			2
he has to pit young against old , rich against poor , women against men , and try to divide the country on other issues			0
i do n't think that 's the kind of country we want to be , " said @entity106 , who was a top media adviser for @entity64 's 2008 nomination bid			1
" anytime you have to explain bad news , you 've already lost			0
the @entity5 campaign has done the best they can with stubbornly high unemployment , talking about the number of jobs created and not the number of people who do n't have jobs			0
but this does n't help the general sense of unease about the economy among middle class @entity41 , " says @entity135 , who ran @entity137 's press operation when he was speaker of the @entity2 and advised @entity139 's 2008 @entity56 presidential bid			1
but be careful what you wish for , says @entity148 strategist and @entity108 contributor @entity147			0
" every time there 's bad economic news for the middle class , the @entity151 corks pop at one of @entity64 's many mansions			1
the bad job numbers are bad news for president @entity5 -- and for all @entity41			2
so the @entity56 has to be careful not to celebrate bad times , " says @entity147 , who was a top adviser in the @entity158 and who now is a senior adviser to @entity160 , the pro-obama super pac			0
so which candidate does the public think will do a better job turning things around ? a @entity108 / @entity167 poll conducted last month indicated that @entity41 were split on which candidate could best jumpstart the economy , with 44 % saying @entity5 would be more likely to get the economy moving and 42 % saying that @entity64 would do a better job to stimulate the economy			1
but the race for the @entity2 is a battle for states and their electoral votes			0
and in two of the biggest and arguably most important battleground states , new surveys from @entity180 indicate that when it comes to the economy , @entity64 has a slight advantage over the president			2
keep your eyes on the monthly unemployment reports between now and november			0
the numbers will be extremely telling .			0

the jobs report is the most important monthly economic report in the @entity2 race
@entity5 on report : " there are still a lot of folks out of work , which means we got ta do more "
@entity64 : " it 's a terrible and very disappointing report "
@entity108 poll indicates @entity41 were split on who could best jump start the economy
