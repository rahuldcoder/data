@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has a new heroine and a new cause -- a girl 's right to education -- and after friday 's announcements from the @entity1 government that they will adopt new measures to get every child into school by end 2015 , that cause has a timetable and a deadline for delivery			1
everywhere you go in @entity1 you find people talking animatedly about the 15 - year - old girl , @entity18 , who was shot by the @entity19 last month			1
a rickshaw touring the streets of @entity0 has a slogan posted on it : " @entity18 for education and peace			0
" go to the local girls ' school and every girl seems to have written either a poem or a song , a letter or a card to @entity18			0
listen to the politicians and every speech is laced with references to the courage of @entity18			0
meet civil society organizations and they will tell you that the audience for their educational demands has risen markedly over the last few weeks			0
it seems that @entity18 's courage has awoken @entity1 's silent majority who are no longer prepared to tolerate the threats and intimidations of the @entity1 @entity19			1
your messages to @entity18 can @entity1 convert its momentary desire to speak out in support of @entity18 into a long term commitment to getting its three million girls and five million children into school ? can the politicians , long - criticized for a failure to deliver , find the teachers , the classrooms and the reading materials to give millions of children a basic education ? this is what i talked about with @entity1 's leaders			1
meeting president @entity67 , and in front of a 500 - strong audience , many of them from the @entity66 where @entity18 was shot , i presented petitions already signed by more than one million people in the international community in honor of @entity18 and her cause			1
these signatures were complemented with another one million signatures collected by @entity1 civil society 's @entity77 to demand free and compulsory education			2
another 100,000 signatures from out - of - school @entity1 children are the start of yet another one million - strong petition , this time from the children themselves demanding their right to school			2
a $ 1,000,000 bounty in @entity18 case the president and i agreed on a series of deadlines in a plan to ensure all of @entity1 's five million out - of - school children have the opportunity to go to school			1
@entity1 on friday asked to join the @entity98 process that will allow the country to assess its current education plans , strategies and obstacles to delivery in consultation with international organizations and then work together to contribute to @entity1 's dream of education for all			1
a deadline for the final draft of this accelerated plan is set for april 2013 when the @entity113 secretary - general ban ki - moon , president of the @entity123 @entity122 and myself , alongside the heads of major international agencies such as @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and the @entity120 , will meet in @entity125 with the @entity126 of @entity1			1
the aim is to match international and domestic support for realizing the 2015 goal			2
suspect 's sister apologizes five months of intensive in - country work with the @entity1 government , civil authorities and foundations , as well as international organizations , lie ahead to ensure a detailed , budgeted plan			2
i have suggested to the president that he consider involving all educational groups from civil society interested in achieving the universal goal in the processes			0
today there is new hope for the three million girls denied their right to schooling and a new chance to ensure the right to education for all			0
@entity1 and the international community are united in their goals			0
but a more active , more engaged and more determined @entity1 people can ensure that education for all is no longer a slogan but a reality .			0

*schoolgirl* @entity18 , shot by @entity19 , inspires @entity1 to education - for - all goal
@entity1 leaders *vow* to get five million children without schooling into classes by 2015
@entity113 envoy @entity169 : it seems that @entity18 's courage has awoken @entity1 's silent majority
he says @entity1 , with international support , must now deliver
