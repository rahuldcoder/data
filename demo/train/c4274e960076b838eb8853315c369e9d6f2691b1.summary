-- as the starting gates clatter open and the horses charge out under the reins of their riders , a nation will once again hold its breath			2
on sunday , following an hors d'oeuvre of four - wheeled @entity10 action at @entity11 , all eyes will turn to the main course in @entity13 as @entity15 's four - legged racers try to grab glory for the first time at the 93rd @entity18			1
so near , yet so far has been the story of recent times , with @entity15 horses finishing second three times in the last four seasons -- @entity24 was the unlucky runner - up in 2012 and 2013 , while @entity26 missed out by a whisker in 2010			1
but a new year brings renewed hope for @entity15 's breeders , trainers and racing fanatics , with three horses -- just a way , @entity34 and @entity35 -- lining up to tackle the mile - and - a - half showpiece at @entity37			1
with an increased prize purse of â ‚ ¬ 5 million ( $ 6.5 million ) , the @entity18 is now the world 's richest turf race			1
" all @entity15 racing fans are very excited about having three @entity15 - trained horses in this year 's @entity18 -- this is the biggest number that we have sent to @entity47 , " @entity15 horse racing journalist and tv presenter @entity41 told @entity0			1
" i think all three have a very good chance , but if i had to pick one of them i expect @entity52 is the best prospect among them -- she is the first three - year - old filly we have sent to the @entity18			2
" it 's an important point , as four of the last six @entity18 winners have been fillies -- the @entity47 - bred @entity61 being the latest 12 months ago			1
the other two hopefuls ' prospects are harder to predict			0
five - year - old @entity35 can be brilliant on his day but is temperamental , while @entity41 thinks just a way may struggle with the distance , despite destroying the field in the @entity68 at the @entity69 last march			0
" just a way is the world 's highest - rated horse but a mile and a half is not his trip			1
we hope he can stay but it 's not easy for horses that have never run 2,400 meters ( 1.5 miles ) before , " @entity41 says			2
from the arc - hives it 's not so long ago that people might have laughed at the suggestion of a @entity15 horse winning the @entity18			1
the country 's first entrant in 1969 , @entity87 , finished 11th in a race won by the @entity90 - trained @entity89			1
further attempts in 1972 by @entity92 and @entity93 14 years later ended with both horses way down the field			0
the breakthrough came in 1999 with @entity98 - bred @entity97 , which won the @entity99 the previous year			2
he carried a sizable lead into the final two furlongs at @entity37 and looked a dead cert to upset favorite @entity104 , but the @entity47 thoroughbred refused to give up and sneaked ahead in the dying yards			0
that battle may have been lost but it signaled the start of @entity15 horses gaining a foothold on the international stage			1
" before then , the standard of @entity15 horses was not so high , " @entity41 explains , while also noting two landmark victories in @entity114 races the previous year			1
@entity117 's win in the @entity118 followed compatriot seeking the @entity121 's triumph at the @entity122 -- both run at @entity47 's @entity125 racecourse			2
" it was a breakthrough for @entity15 racehorses racing overseas and now the standard of @entity15 trained horses is very competitive all over the world , " @entity41 says			1
wins for @entity131 at the @entity132 in 2006 and @entity133 at the 2011 @entity134 bear testament to this fact -- but also to the dedication of the @entity138 family , which oversees a vast breeding operation on @entity141			0
now run by three brothers -- @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 -- its assets include the world - famous @entity148 , home to leading sire @entity151			2
" without the great support of the @entity138 brothers in the breeding industry , i think it is impossible to contemplate a @entity15 horse winning the @entity18 , " @entity41 says			1
@entity158 the near misses of recent years have only added to the intrigue , with interest back in @entity15 reaching fever pitch in recent days			0
" there has been huge coverage all week so far , " says @entity41			0
" all the newspapers and sports papers are covering it			0
many of the major tv and radio stations have been dispatching their correspondents to @entity172 to see how @entity15 horses are training			1
" on sunday evening , two television stations are going to have live coverage even though the start time is after midnight and millions of @entity15 people are going to watch the race live on tv , " he adds			2
@entity41 has seen plenty of @entity181 come and go over the years			0
his first trip to @entity37 was in 1986 -- seen by many as a vintage year for the event , with one of the best fields ever assembled			0
his latest sojourn in the @entity47 capital could prove equally memorable			0
it would certainly be a fitting year for @entity15 to break its duck , he thinks			0
" we have three @entity15 - trained horses on sunday , all ridden by @entity15 jockeys			1
last year , @entity24 was ridden by @entity47 jockey @entity194 , " he says			0
" the fact we are sending pure @entity15 teams ( this year ) is quite important for @entity15 society			0
we hope to see one of these teams raise the national flag on the center pole on sunday			0
