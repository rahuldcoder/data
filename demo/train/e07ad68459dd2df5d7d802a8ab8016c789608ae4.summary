-- i 'm a little nervous about flying right now			1
an airplane takes off from @entity5 's main airport and disappears			1
an international coalition of countries has been searching for @entity8 for more than a week without success			1
how does an airplane disappear ? closer to home , a @entity12 flight blows a tire on takeoff and smartphone pictures show the plane 's nose hitting the ground			1
fortunately , the pilot manages to land without seriously injuring anyone			0
a @entity23 aircraft loses a panel on one of its wings during a flight from @entity28 , @entity29 , to @entity30			0
these scary - sounding mishaps are smaller reminders that things can and do go wrong despite how rare airline accidents are , many travelers get nervous when major -- and even relatively minor -- incidents occur			1
it 's not rational thinking			1
the odds of dying in an airplane crash are really low			1
there were 35.1 million commercial flights worldwide , and 15 fatal accidents with 414 fatalities in 2012 , the last full year for which the @entity46 has @entity49 data			1
and the odds are even better if you only flew within the @entity52 : there were no airline fatalities in the @entity52 in 2012 , according to the @entity55			0
you know you 're more likely to die in a car crash			1
more than 33,000 people died in motor vehicle crashes in 2012 in the @entity52 alone			1
also specific to the @entity52 , the @entity65 's 2012 @entity64 reports a fatality rate of 1.14 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled			1
over the course of your lifetime , you 're more likely to die by killing yourself ( 1 in 106 ) , drowning ( 1 in 1,112 ) or choking on your food ( 1 in 3,842 ) , according to the @entity69			1
now that we know all that data , why do air disasters still unnerve us ? the mind was built to flee from an evolutionary perspective , the mind 's primary objective is to look out for anything that might harm us and avoid it at all costs , says @entity81 , a psychologist at the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84			1
this has helped people live longer for thousands of years , she says			2
this discomfort over this latest airline incident reminds us how little control we have over many aspects of our lives			0
" we like to be able to see , hear and control where we 're going and what we 're doing ; we like situations in which we believe we could make an exit if necessary , grab the wheel , or jump out of the way , " says @entity81 , via e-mail			2
" with flying , that 's impossible			2
" this is one weird airline mystery commercial airline pilot and aviation author @entity102 says the intense media coverage causes people to lose track of the fact that , despite occasional tragedies , commercial flying has never been safer than it is right now			2
" worldwide , the trend over the past several years has been one of steady improvement , to the point where last year was the safest in the entire history of commercial aviation , " says @entity102 , who blogs about air travel at @entity111 , via e-mail			0
" hopefully their number continues to diminish , but a certain number of accidents will always be inevitable			2
" " in some ways , the weirdness of the @entity125 story speaks to how well we have engineered away what once were the most common causes of crashes			2
those that still occur tend to be more mysterious and strange than in decades past			0
" airline fatalities are rare , but the possibility is still scary			0
what can we do about it ? face your fear do n't try to run from the fear , suggests @entity81			0
" rather than trying to control the plane , work on accepting the desire to control it , " she says			0
" thank your mind for trying to protect you			0
focus on simply noticing the thoughts , feelings and sensations without attaching to them or trying to make them go away			0
" tell the crew you 're scared , suggests flight attendant @entity150 , author of " @entity151 : tales of @entity153 , @entity154 , and @entity155 at 35,000 feet			2
" " if we know you 're scared , we 'll go out of our way to be reassuring if the airplane does encounter a few bumps , " says @entity150 , via e-mail			1
" we 'll update you on whatever information the captain passes along to us regarding delays , mechanicals , weather or turbulence			0
i 've gone as far as to sit in an empty seat beside someone and hold their hand			0
" @entity150 , who 's been a flight attendant for 18 years , suggests passengers who hate turbulence sit close to the cockpit -- the front of the plane is n't as bumpy as the rear			1
passengers can also download the @entity181 app to track the bumpy weather			0
or how about a prayer ? artist 's way author @entity184 writes out prayers for her specific fears of flying : takeoff , turbulence and landing			2
she also takes a nice stack of gossip magazines : " @entity193			0
celebrity cellulite can make you forget turbulence			0

the disappearance of @entity8 has made some nervous fliers more nervous
*statistics* are on the flier 's side : more people die in car accidents than in airplane crashes
even eating is more dangerous -- you 're more likely to die by choking on your dinner
