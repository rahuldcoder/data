-- shortly after @entity4 stepped down as prime minister more than a decade ago , @entity3 's state - run @entity2 newspaper ran a story in which various party and government officials accused him of being arrogant , autocratic and corrupt			1
neither those portrayals , however , nor the fact @entity4 was appointed and served three years under deposed president @entity11 spelled the end of the economist 's political career			1
in fact , he now appears set to take on his old role at one of the most tumultuous , momentous times in modern @entity3 history			0
on thursday , military spokesman lt. col. @entity20 told @entity0 that @entity4 , 81 , had agreed -- after meeting with @entity21 , field marshal of the @entity22 and @entity3 's dominant figure since @entity11 's ouster in february -- to become @entity3 's prime minister once again			1
if he can put together a government , @entity4 will complete a resurgence that might have seemed unlikely after he left office in 1999			2
the next april , @entity2 noted criticisms levied at @entity4 -- from then - parliamentary speaker @entity30 , @entity11 's chief of staff @entity31 and several members of parliament -- tied to his handling of financial and other matters during his three years as prime minister			1
for instance , @entity30 claimed that @entity4 had excessively issued military orders , citing his role as military governor , under emergency law			0
@entity30 called such orders " a clear infringement of the assembly 's legislative mandate , " according to the @entity2 report			0
and @entity48 , a member of the then - minority and liberal @entity49 , blasted what he described as @entity4 's authoritarian actions as a " flagrant infringement of the constitution and parliament 's authority , " in the same @entity2 story			0
still , the fact that @entity21 apparently approached @entity4 about the prime minister 's job suggests that -- more than 11 years later -- military leaders today have a high opinion of him			2
he has online supporters as well , including a @entity65 page with 653 " likes " as of thursday night and filled with comments suggesting that he is the best person to lead @entity3			0
besides his economic background at a time of continued financial crisis in @entity3 , @entity4 would bring a wealth of government experience to the job			0
starting in 1987 , he served as a deputy prime minister			2
in 1996 , @entity11 appointed @entity4 as prime minister after @entity77 resigned after nine years in that position .			1

@entity4 was an @entity3 deputy prime minister in the late 1980s
in 1996 , president @entity11 appointed him as @entity3 's prime minister
political leaders criticized @entity4 after he left office in 1999 , state media says
a military spokesman says @entity4 has agreed to become prime minister again
