-- it was rush hour on a tuesday , and @entity3 was sitting in traffic in her @entity5 on the lower level of the @entity7 , in @entity8 , @entity9 , when the voice on the radio said , " we 're having an earthquake			1
" suddenly , the concrete around her began to ripple			2
there was a giant crash , and a large , heavy beam dropped on the front of her car , crushing the engine , barely missing her face			2
the car dropped 20 feet , and when it settled , @entity27 's left foot was trapped			2
the double - decker freeway had collapsed , pinning motorists in their cars			1
@entity27 found a pen and decided to write a note to her husband , just in case			2
" @entity37 , earthquake hit while i was under concrete , worst happened , " she wrote			1
" it collapsed on car			0
i 'm alive , just my left foot is stuck under the car			0
hope they do n't kill me getting me out			0
love you lots , good luck to us both			0
" firefighter @entity48 was running out of time as he struggled to free @entity27 's foot and get her to safety			0
each aftershock lowered the upper deck , bringing it closer to crushing @entity27 and @entity48			0
then , @entity48 was able to nudge the crushed dashboard just enough			0
her section of the @entity58 collapsed 20 minutes later			0
that was october 17 , 1989			0
the magnitude 6.9 earthquake , now called @entity62 , killed 63 people , 42 of them on the @entity58 freeway			1
the quake caused $ 10 billion in damage , ultimately inspiring @entity9 and the rest of the region to re-examine their safety measures for earthquakes			0
nearby @entity72 sits on a huge fault line that separates two of the @entity76 's tectonic plates			1
one plate lies beneath the @entity78 , off @entity72 's coast , and it is being shoved beneath the @entity81 continent , according to @entity82 , a geologist and chief scientist at @entity84			1
are earthquakes on the rise ? the fault line , known as the @entity88 , could one day cause an even larger quake			1
" as the two plates collide , " @entity82 says , " the fault gets stuck , eventually slipping when enough stress builds up to produce a great earthquake			1
" with ultra-accurate gps , @entity82 says scientists know that the collision is still going on because they can measure the movement			0
@entity72 actually moves about 1Â½ inches every year , typical for a region near a subduction zone			1
these megaquakes can cause strong shaking over large areas for several minutes			0
they can also lead to landslides , tsunamis and widespread liquefaction , turning soil to soup			0
after the deadly 9.0 - magnitude quake and tsunami that struck @entity112 in march 2011 , @entity72 legislators commissioned a study on the impact a comparable quake could have on the state			1
@entity82 was one of the authors of the @entity118 , which is aimed at reducing risk and improving recovery for the next @entity88 earthquake and tsunami			2
@entity72 is not prepared for a megaquake , and few areas are , @entity82 says			1
he says @entity112 is the most prepared , " and look at the results of their megaquake			1
" the 2011 earthquake and tsunami resulted in more than 15,000 deaths			2
before 1974 , there were no specific building requirements in @entity72 to make sure structures were built to withstand major quakes , and design codes have only been adequate for the megaquake since 1993 , so many structures are not designed to resist such a large earthquake , @entity82 says			1
earthquake fast facts " on top of that , we have a lot of mountainous terrain that is highly susceptible to landslides , large areas that are susceptible to liquefaction , and 300 miles of coast that will be inundated by tsunamis that will arrive within 15 to 20 minutes of the earthquake and may locally reach elevations of 100 feet above sea level , " he says			1
it is these factors that led the @entity118 to conclude that in a worst - case scenario , 10,000 people could be killed , and large areas of @entity72 could be without transportation , electricity , water and sewer for several months to several years			1
the damage could result in $ 30 billion in economic losses			0
@entity82 says $ 30 billion is almost certainly an underestimate , and death estimates could also be off			0
based on the study of geologic features that record prehistoric earthquakes , scientists generally agree that there have been 42 megaquakes along the @entity88 fault in the last 10,000 years , with the most recent in january 1700			1
using historic data , scientists like dr. @entity175 , a marine geologist and professor at @entity177 , can forecast the probability of another great quake			0
the @entity88 is actually made up of different clusters , according to @entity175			0
on the south end of the fault , the data shows that an earthquake with a magnitude between the high sevens and low eights occurs every 250 years			1
" we 're 300 years into a 240 year cycle , " says @entity175			2
on the other hand , the north end , with the great population centers , sees a big event closer to every 500 years			2
but before @entity196 panic , consider @entity175 's assessment of the statistics			0
for the south end of the @entity88 , there is roughly a 35 - 40 % probability of having a major quake in the next 50 years			1
on the north end , there is only a 10 - 15 % probability			2
even if there is still plenty of time before the next big quake , much work has to be done to make sure @entity72 is ready			1
" the most important thing is to strengthen or replace infrastructure to make sure that our lifeline systems like power and water will not be so severely damaged that they require years to repair			2
we also need to strengthen or replace critical facilities like hospitals , fire and police facilities and schools , " says @entity82			0
following on the release of the @entity118 , the @entity221 established a task force to come up with specific recommendations for action for the 2015 legislative session			0
@entity72 has already turned a corner because institutions are no longer asking , " why should i do anything to prepare " and are now asking , " how do i pay for the preparation i know i need ? "			1

25 years *ago* , a *6.7* - magnitude earthquake hit @entity234
since then , west coast *communities* have assessed their earthquake readiness
a huge fault line runs through @entity72
@entity72 , like much of the world , is not prepared for a megaquake
