@entity0 -- the @entity2 passed a financial consent agreement wednesday evening with a 5 - 4 vote , which grants the city the power to void contracts and slash costs but not provide state funding or loans to bail the city out of its financial problems			1
city and state officials avoided a thursday deadline to save the city from the threat of looming financial insolvency or a takeover of city government by @entity23			1
the consent agreement was backed by mayor @entity25 and @entity23 gov. @entity26			1
the deputy mayor of @entity28 , @entity29 , signed off on the consent agreement on behalf of @entity25 , who is recuperating from a hospital stay			2
@entity26 issued a statement shortly after the vote and commended the council for acting " responsibly , " but said there is still work to be done			2
" the magnitude of the city 's financial challenges means that many difficult decisions lie ahead , " the governor said			2
" we must build on this spirit of cooperation and be willing to act in the city 's long - term interests			2
" the review team voted to accept the agreement before the city council met			0
fierce opposition from unions -- in a city that remains a bastion of labor power -- threatened to stymie efforts to pass the rescue package			0
if the city council did not agree on the deal , @entity26 could have , by law , appointed an " emergency manager " who would have assumed the powers of the mayor and council to run day - to - day operations			0
the city council was under pressure from the public and city unions to reject the deal with the state			2
at the same time , it would lose its powers if @entity26 went ahead and named an emergency manager			0
the only action it has taken this week to deal with the crisis was to double the city 's corporate income tax to 2 %			0
years of decline in population and businesses and a shrinking of the tax base have pushed @entity28 into a deep financial hole despite a recent resurgence in the @entity87 auto industry			1
without more cost cutting , the city wo n't be able to pay its bills come june			1
an estimate in january , the most recent available , was that the city would be down to $ 20.9 million in the bank by the end of this week			0
an emergency manager would have had the authority to void contracts with unions and vendors			0
he or she could also sell off various city assets , from the water department to valuable art in the city 's museum			0
as the debates , negotiations and lawsuits raged this week , they did so without @entity25 , who was recently released from the hospital after serious intestinal surgery and wo n't return to work for two weeks			1
both @entity25 and @entity26 said they want to avoid a state takeover , which in itself could be the first step toward the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation 's history			1
while @entity28 continues to struggle financially , the @entity87 automakers based in or near the city have enjoyed a financial resurgence			1
@entity121 reported a record profit in 2011			0
and a pick up in auto sales and hiring has led to a nearly two - point drop in @entity23 's unemployment rate over the last 12 months , the biggest improvement of any state			1
@entity1 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			0

@entity132 *faces* insolvency ; vote *prevents* @entity23 state takeover
without more cost cutting , the city wo n't be able to pay its bills come june
city of @entity28 struggling , but its automakers enjoying financial resurgence
