@entity0 -- the @entity2 wavered like the tides wednesday in an unusual dispute over whether owners of private waterfront property were unfairly deprived title to land that touches the ocean			1
it was unclear from the one - hour public session which way the justices might go on the case			1
at issue is whether courts , by reinterpreting state law , can deprive deed holders of their traditional shoreline rights , amounting to a " judicial taking " of property			1
@entity23 officials said that when the state deposited tons of new sand on eroding shorelines , the replenished land became government property , essentially creating a strip of public beach between the landowners ' property and the ocean			1
several residents along the nearly seven - mile stretch of reclaimed land near the resort town of @entity39 protested , saying their oceanfront property line extends to the water , a practice they say has been endorsed in prior state courts for more than a century			1
the lawyer for the homeowners called it a " land grab " by the local government			2
@entity49 told the high court that what had been a beach stretching 200 feet to the water has become a 75 - foot stretch of public beach , between the property line and the water 's edge			1
" people pay a lot more for beachfront homes for that reason , " instead of property with beach views , said justice @entity58			2
" you did n't lose one inch , " justice @entity65 said about the homeowners who sued			0
" all you lost was the right to touch the water			0
but the [ state ] court here says you in effect have that right because you can walk right over it and get to the water			0
" the state says nearly 200 miles -- about a quarter of the state 's 825 miles of beaches -- have been restored in an area prone to hurricanes and heavy storms churned up in the @entity82 and the @entity83			1
and officials say that since such " emergent " land does not take away property , it is not considered eminent domain , in which the government would have to compensate the private owner			1
property rights along the water -- known as littoral ownership -- have long been a tricky matter			1
in most coastal states , beachfront property is split between the government and private owners			2
the dividing line has traditionally been the mean high water line ( @entity103 ) , a flexible border that depends on shifting sands and tides			0
the state usually owns the property seaward of the @entity103			2
the homeowners who sued -- who had just six of the 448 parcels included in that replenishment project -- created a group called stop the @entity114 local environmental groups , and some other homeowners in the neighborhood , say the plaintiffs appear to be " looking a gift horse in the mouth " -- benefiting from taxpayer - paid restoration but claiming ownership of the artificial beach			0
the @entity23 @entity2 ruled in favor of the state , prompting the high court appeal			1
the area along @entity23 's @entity127 is known for its dramatic crystal white sands			1
@entity39 , a popular beach town , calls itself the " world 's luckiest fishing village			0
" @entity49 told the court the difference between beachfront and " beach view " -- from an aesthetic and financial point of view -- is tremendous , when property values are considered			0
" it was a wholesale transfer of rights as well as the deed , " he said			0
but @entity65 said state law was generous to the private owners , saying no permanent structures , or anything that would spoil the right of peaceful enjoyment of their property , could be placed on the reclaimed land			1
" now , if they put a noisy hot dog stand that keeps you up at night , does n't that violate the statute ? " he asked			0
justice @entity156 went further , saying that a boat or even a floating hot dog stand could sit just offshore , in a foot of water , and the private owners might not be able to do anything about it since it remained public property			1
" no different than what exists today , before the legislation , which is if the hot dog vendor wanted to sit in a foot of water , it could have , " she said			0
" so none of your actual use rights , pleasure rights or anything else has been changed " by the reclamation project , she said			0
justice @entity176 , leading the strongest voice among his conservative colleagues , suggested the state court made " a fundamental change in @entity23 property law to extend these concepts of [ natural sediment erosion or addition ] to things that are done by the state			1
" does that mean the state could come in and knock down the house and say this is an artificial avulsion ? " he asked , referring to environmental damage done by a severe storm			0
he then took the hot dog hypothetical further			0
" suppose a city decided it wanted to attract more students who were going to the beach in @entity23 for spring break , and so therefore it decided it was going to create a huge beach in front of privately owned homes			2
under the decision of the @entity23 @entity2 , i do n't see anything that would stop the city from doing that , " he theorized , saying such an event could even be televised			1
" as a practical matter , does n't that have a real effect on the value of the property ? " the case has not yet risen to the level of public outcry from the high court 's separate 2005 ruling , which said the government had the power under eminent domain to take private homes and give them to private developers , in the name of improving downtrodden neighborhoods			1
that provoked widespread criticism and led several states to reform their eminent domain laws			0
property rights advocates , supported by a range of conservative and libertarian legal groups , back the homeowners in the beach dispute			2
@entity230 , along with a majority of states and the @entity234 administration , back @entity23			2
justice @entity235 was not on the bench for the morning arguments			0
no explanation has yet been given for his absence , but the 89 - year - old justice may have recused himself because he owns beachfront property in the state			1
the justices will decide whether courts , apart from legislatures or the executive branch , have the power through a ruling to create a private property " taking , " something historically prohibited by the @entity250			2
it is an issue they have been pondering , but never really tackling , for decades			0
the case is stop the @entity255 of @entity256 ( 08 - 1151 )			0
a ruling is expected by spring 2010 .			0

the @entity259 @entity2 held a one - hour public session wednesday on shoreline rights
@entity23 says that when it put new sand on eroding shorelines , that land became state 's
private landowners , however , say their property lines have always extended to the ocean
