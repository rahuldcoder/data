@entity0 -- before @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , before the first @entity6 , before a young face stared back from the side of a milk carton , there was @entity10			2
@entity11 was 4 when he vanished in 1959 while on a family camping trip			1
he was on a family camping trip to @entity15 's @entity14			1
he was playing with his dad one minute , gone the next			2
" just like that , " recalled his brother @entity18			2
@entity10 was 4 years old			1
last weekend , his loved ones returned to the campsite and to the scene of the presumed stranger abduction			1
they came to remember @entity10 and to rededicate a half - century mission to find him			1
even with the passage of time , their faith has not wavered			0
" we 've never doubted that he 's ... out there , " @entity18 said			1
" until they prove otherwise , we hope one day we will be reunited			0
" their hope has been bolstered by investigators with the @entity36 and the @entity37 , which reopened the case last year after hearing of a recent conversation			1
" a lead was sparked when someone was sitting in a public area talking about what happened , " @entity36 spokeswoman @entity40 wrote in an e-mail to the media			1
as cold case cops know , a wisp of a lead can turn into a big break , a fact @entity36 special agent @entity47 believes can solve the @entity55 mystery			1
" even if [ people ] think it 's insignificant , it 's probably not , " @entity47 said			1
" each little piece of the puzzle may not mean something , but when you put it all together , you get the big picture			0
" @entity10 was the third youngest of @entity65 and @entity67 's seven children			1
he had brown hair and big brown eyes			0
" he 's such a very pretty and sweet child , " his mom told the @entity71 in an article published june 21 , 1959			1
" i can understand why someone would want to take him , because he 's such a pretty child			2
" three days earlier , @entity10 , his parents and his siblings were enjoying a family outing near the @entity80 shore			2
@entity10 and his dad had just returned from getting some drinks at a store			0
and then someone noticed that @entity10 was gone			0
" i had first believed that despite @entity10 's fear of water , he had wandered into the water and drowned , " @entity67 told the @entity71			1
i believe he probably walked up the road , and someone picked him up			0
" the search was extensive and immediate			0
hundreds combed the land and the waters , looking for @entity10			0
bloodhounds were given his scent and dispatched to follow it			0
alligators were killed and cut open			0
but there was no trace of @entity10 , then or now			0
for his parents and the police , the sickening conclusion was quickly reached : he was stolen by a human predator			0
@entity10 's mom could not fathom that the kidnapper would bring harm to her boy			1
" i hope now that someone did take @entity10 , because i know if anyone wanted him bad enough to kidnap him , they would take good care of him , " she said			0
fifty years later , the family longs for closure			2
@entity65 and @entity67 are both deceased , but their children carry on the decades - long pursuit to know the truth			2
on dannybarter.com , a web site dedicated to finding answers , the family posted this plea to the public : " we strongly believe that someone out there knows what happened to @entity10 and possibly knows him as another identity			2
we hope to find him safe and sound			0
" the @entity36 is also seeking information on @entity11			1
it has published two photographs of him on its web site			0
one shows the smiling child , taken in the months before @entity10 was abducted			0
the other picture is age - progressed , depicting what @entity10 would look like today at 54			2
if you have any information on the @entity11 case , go to dannybarter.com or contact the @entity36 , your local police or the @entity37 in @entity15 .			1
