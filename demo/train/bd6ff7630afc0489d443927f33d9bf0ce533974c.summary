-- there 's a lot riding on the @entity3			1
while @entity4 until now have generally been capable if not outstanding devices , the @entity3 brings @entity7 's mobile platform to a new level			1
not only does it add a super-fast @entity11 connection from @entity12 , but it 'll also serve as a flagship device for @entity14 and @entity7 , at least until @entity16 devices come later in the year			1
i 've been using the @entity18 900 for the past week , and it 's a great smartphone			2
it 's also an excellent example of just how far the @entity16 platform has come since its debut a year and a half ago			2
good @entity16 apps used to be in extremely short supply , but i was pleasantly surprised to see many of the same apps that i use regularly on @entity26 in the @entity27			2
@entity30 ? it 's there			2
there 's even @entity37 , yo			2
still , there 's no @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 or @entity43			2
so the marketplace -- recently clocked at 65,000 apps to the @entity46 's 600,000 -- certainly has some catching up to do			2
but if you 're not already locked into another platform , it 's reassuring to know @entity16 has the essentials covered			2
@entity51 stretches out most of those apps look gorgeous on the @entity18 900â € ²s 4.3 - inch oled screen			1
indeed , the increasing sizes on today 's smartphones are perfect for @entity16 's metro interface			2
its design favors big fonts and splash layouts that stretch to the screen 's edges and beyond			1
@entity16 works best when it 's got lots of real estate to work with			1
for example , @entity66 makes the multiple menus in the app feel like one giant poster			0
my friends , activity and checkins are all partitioned into pretty columns			0
the @entity26 and @entity77 versions look claustrophobic by comparison ( see below )			0
the seamless @entity51 - inspired design is n't automatic , however , and your mileage will vary from app to app. most apps from indie developers are pretty blah			1
the design occasionally trips itself up			0
@entity51 presents its iconography as if it were as familiar as street signs , showing symbols with no labels			0
it 's pretty easy to pick the wrong function , especially if it 's your first time launching the app. when navigating , you should proceed with caution , especially in social apps			0
shares and check - ins can happen before you know what you 're doing			1
begging to be touched pretty design is one thing , but usability is another			0
@entity16 begs to be touched , swiped and pinched , even more than @entity26 or @entity77			0
the big layouts practically beg you to see what 's on the next screen			1
here 's where the @entity18 900â € ²s @entity110 processor shines			0
it 's only a single - core design ( @entity7 does n't yet allow multi-core chips on @entity4 ) , but it was more than enough to keep up as i pushed and pulled menus with my fingers			1
the whole interface feels alive as you touch it			0
besides the great ui , @entity14 offers up some special apps to @entity18 owners			1
probably most useful is @entity123 , a free turn - by - turn navigation service that works with @entity125 ( not @entity126 , which are also pretty )			1
@entity14 has also created dynamic @entity51 apps for @entity128 and @entity129 that look fantastic , especially when it comes to @entity131 @entity128 app highlights one of @entity16 's differentiators : live tiles			1
the photo from the most recent top story in the app is highlighted on the app 's icon on your home screen			1
that 's great , but there 's no headline or even a slug to help guide the user			0
what , for example , is this picture of @entity150 supposed to signify ? nuts & bolts back to the hardware			0
this is a really well - made phone ; even though the screen is 0.8 inches larger than an @entity46 's , it does n't feel large in your hand			1
that 's partly thanks to the polycarbonate casing , which is smooth but provides an excellent grip			0
@entity14 offers bumpers that can better protect it , but it 's pretty durable			1
i do n't know why you 'd want to cover it up			0
the camera is 8 megapixels , and to my eye the quality is on par with the @entity172 , though it records at " only " 720p resolution			1
the @entity18 900â € ²s screen shows off @entity176 's strengths -- bright colors and true blacks that make icons and artwork pop. the screen also uses anti-reflection optics to reduce its reflectance			1
the upshot : a screen that 's much easier to see in bright sunlight			2
you can see just how much in the gallery below			0
finally , there 's that @entity11 connection			0
i managed to get download speeds up to 28.4 megabits per second here in the @entity193 of @entity194			0
that 's pretty amazing , especially when you consider our office @entity196 typically got about 9 mbps			0
puttering along at @entity12 's " @entity200 " @entity198 + speeds , my @entity172 maxed out at 1.9 mbps			0
@entity18 rises the @entity3 , which will be in stores april 8 for the tidy sum of $ 99.99 ( with contract ) , is by far the best @entity16 ever made			1
not only does it have a great screen for @entity51 apps , it has the hardware to really deliver on the experience they promise			2
this is the device that @entity7 needs to show off how good @entity16 can be			1
sure , you do n't get @entity40 ( yet ) , but the world of possibility it opens is unlike anything else out there			0

the @entity3 will be in stores april 8 for the tidy sum of $ 99.99
flagship phone is result of a *partnership* between @entity14 and @entity7
the screen on the phone uses anti-reflection optics to reduce its reflectance
@entity123 is a free turn - by - turn navigation service that works with @entity125
