-- the @entity1 said wednesday a closed @entity3 food processing plant tested positive for a bacteria that has been linked to the deaths of four people			1
the @entity7 on october 20 ordered @entity8 to immediately stop processing food and recall all products shipped from its @entity12 plant since january			2
the move came after state laboratory results showed listeria monocytogenes , a bacteria that can cause severe illness , in chopped celery at the plant			1
four people died when they contracted listeriosis after consuming celery that had been processed at the @entity8 plant , said @entity23 , a department spokeswoman			1
state health authorities came to this determination while investigating 10 cases in which people with serious underlying health problems contracted listeriosis over an 8 - month period			0
six of those cases -- in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity36 counties -- were linked to chopped celery processed at the @entity8 plant , the state health services department said			1
four of those people died , as did one other person who authorities believe got listeriosis from another source not connected with @entity8 products			1
the @entity1 inspected the company 's premises and said it issued a summary of its findings to the company on october 26			1
it said it found the bacteria in processed celery and in multiple locations in the plant , including food contact surfaces			1
the listeria found in samples " matches the dna fingerprint of the clinical cases of listeriosis reported by the @entity7 , " the @entity1 said in a statement			1
@entity8 had independent @entity58 of @entity59 , @entity3 , test the plant for listeria			1
results came back negative , @entity8 attorney @entity62 told @entity0			0
" the @entity1 and the state have not turned over to us the documentation supporting their findings , " @entity62 said			2
" we can not comment on these most recent findings until the documentation is provided for independent evaluation by our experts			0
" still , the company in recent weeks brought in an independent listeria expert to look at protocols , said @entity62			1
the entire facility , including its machines , were cleaned , said @entity62			1
about 100 @entity8 workers have been idled by the plant closing , and the company needs to reopen soon if it is to survive , @entity62 said			2
a november 17 administrative hearing on its status is scheduled , and @entity8 is working with the agencies on reopening , he said			0
" we 're pretty optimistic about having the company up and running before the hearing , " the attorney said			0
" we 're not going the litigation route			0
" in october , @entity88 denied wrongdoing , saying it has had " an excellent record of safety and health " over the past three years			2
state health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company 's plant			2
@entity8 processes a wide variety of products -- including three varieties of lettuce , peppers , carrots , cucumbers and various cut - up fruit , as well as salad , fruit and soup mixes , according to the company 's website			0
they are distributed primarily in sealed packages to restaurants , hospitals , schools and other large institutions that serve food			0
besides the bacteria , inspectors found a condensation leak above a food product area , dirt on a food - preparation table , and hand - washing problems at the @entity12 plant , the state health department said			0
the @entity1 said wednesday inspectors found several other problems , including hoses making contact with food , bagged carrots being stored on a wet floor , a lack of adequate drainage areas , foods not being stored at the proper temperature and a failure to safely clean utensils and equipment			2
listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium found in the soil , in water and in animals that carry it without showing signs they are sick , according to the @entity150 - based @entity149			0
it can get into vegetables from soil or manure that is used as fertilizer			0
the strain of bacteria is relatively resilient -- with an incubation period of three to 70 days , @entity23 said -- and some foods can be contaminated after cooking but prior to packaging			0
the bacteria have been tied to listeriosis , which sickens about 2,500 @entity163 and contributes to the death of 500 people annually , the @entity149 reports			0
the @entity3 health department is taking the lead in the investigation , with assistance from the @entity1 and the @entity149			1
the state justified its closure of the @entity8 plant , citing @entity3 law that authorizes such actions if conditions pose " an immediate and serious threat to human life or health			2
