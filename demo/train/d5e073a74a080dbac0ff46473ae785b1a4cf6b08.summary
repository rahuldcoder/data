-- schoolchildren in @entity3 remain in the line of fire of the country 's civil war , where shells and bombs deliver death and trauma into classrooms , @entity1 lamented friday on @entity13			1
many pupils and teachers dare not attend lessons , opting to take cover or flee with their families , leaving schools deserted			1
but the violence is forcing some classes literally underground , into caves			1
in the town of @entity34 , in the embattled @entity32 province , the shrieks and laughter of children scurrying from class to class , while teachers rein them in with firm , gentle admonishments , have died out from the hallway of a large school , leaving it completely empty , with the exception of an arid pile of concrete rubble that fell when a shell blasted through the ceiling			1
even with its battle scars , the school in @entity34 -- compared with @entity45 videos of damage done to other schools -- makes an almost intact impression			1
video : @entity3 rebels say they will kill @entity53 hostages but war has made the school too unsafe for children , explains local activist @entity57 in a social media video posted thursday to @entity59			1
" here we are during the school hours , and there is not a single student here , " he says in the taut tone and gestures of a citizen turned journalist , as the wind lashes over his microphone			2
" we were surprised that the school was hit by the regime shelling from jet fighters , " he says , pointing to the gaping hole in the ceiling			2
@entity76 is a target of the indiscriminate bombing of civilians , according to @entity80 , which investigated the town			2
" battlefield weapons and munitions -- unguided bombs dropped from the air and imprecise artillery shells and mortars , which have a wide impact radius and can not be aimed at specific targets -- are now being used daily against residential areas , significantly increasing the number of civilian casualties , " @entity80 said in a report on @entity34 in september			0
the @entity3 children share a similar fate with students in conflict regions around the world , according to @entity1			1

this year 's report focused on education in regions beset with the violence			0
as @entity57 steps inside a classroom , the camera reveals rows of empty desks			0
his voice echoes loudly off of desolate walls , as he walks viewers through the school , which has become a deadly trap			0
read more : @entity121 still has no plan for @entity3 " not a single soul in this classroom ; everyone left because they fear the random shelling and the attacks , " he says			1
the @entity3 government has justified military operations at schools in state media reports , stating that rebels have used them as bomb - making factories and weapons caches			1
@entity0 can not confirm the authenticity of events depicted in social media because of restrictions on journalists by the @entity3 government and life - threatening dangers involved with reporting from inside the country			1
but the @entity3 government confirmed in september to the @entity146 that more than 2,000 of the country 's 22,000 schools had been damaged or destroyed			1
@entity57 traipses silently back out into the open - air hallway , gazing down at the rubble crunching under his shoes , then the video abruptly cuts to another scene			0
@entity154 : turbulence in the @entity156 the activist leads the camera into a dark , gray room , but his report has a happy ending , because the community and the school 's teachers have not given up on their children , their future or their education			1
" one thing that we found ... was that even in these conflict - ridden countries , there is a real desire for education , " @entity101 says			0
" it 's a very flexible approach , but they really want education to continue for their children			1
" @entity76 's school and its children have gone into hiding -- in a cave in the countryside outside of town , not out of the ordinary in wartime @entity3 , says @entity80			1
" some towns and villages have been virtually emptied of their residents , many of whom are now camping out in the surrounding countryside or hiding in caves			1
" reminiscent of the stone schoolhouse in a @entity195 comic , the cave 's interior is hewn by human hands into cubed - shaped real rooms			0
spotlights shine down onto the children and glare into the camera			1
the cave school is in @entity202 , a small village near @entity34 , in a region known for its picturesque nature , flowing green fields and groves of olives , cherries and grapes -- none of it visible from the cavern classroom , which has no windows			0
citizen reporter @entity214 is again planted in front of the camera , but now , from behind hm , the lively voices of schoolchildren , raising their hands , eager to answer questions , drone into his microphone			0
they are calling out to a teacher , who is animating them to learn			0
the male instructor introduces @entity57 to the group of first - through fourth - graders , who greet him graciously with a round of applause			0
" so , why here ? " @entity57 asks			0
the teacher , who does not give his name , replies : " we want to keep educating our children , but in the city , there is always this imminent danger that the regime choppers or planes will bomb us or drop the @entity245 barrels			2
" most of @entity34 's residents have fled with their children , he says			2
" we are teaching whoever is left behind			0
" in spite of the hope that the cave 's stone walls and the remote location offer real protection , it is still dangerous for the children to go to and from school , the teacher says			2
he groans about the lack of supplies , the small blackboard and the dim lighting			0

" there is suffering , but thank @entity274 , we are moving on , " he says			0
he is happy for what progress he can make with the students			2
children in conflict situations " need a classroom , where they feel safe , " @entity101 says			2
" they need a teacher who understands their psychological needs as well as their learning needs			0
" the teacher calls on a student seated on the floor to stand up and talk to @entity57 , who asks him what he would like to tell president @entity292 's government			0
" we want them to leave us alone ; enough killing and destruction ; we 've had it , " the boy says			0
" we ca n't get close to our schools			2
" the interviewer follows up with a question : " what do you want to be when you grow up ? " " a doctor , " answers the boy			0

" those who were in school really had a desire to learn , and schooling gave them a sense of feeling normal			2
" @entity101 says aid organizations should boost education in their programs			2
" only 2 % of humanitarian aid is spent on education , " she says in a disappointed tone			1
she also wants to see the perpetrators of violence at schools brought to justice and their misdeeds publicized			2
in the @entity3 cave , the teacher steers his class away from the camera and back to schoolwork			1
" ok , let 's recite what you learned today one more time , " he calls out			0
@entity57 gets out of his way then strikes up a conversation with a female teacher in the next room			0
the activist asks her to deliver a message to the government			0
" we will be victorious , " the teacher proclaims , " and we will raise our children to be the teachers , the doctors and the engineers of tomorrow 's @entity3			1
