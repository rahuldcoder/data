the world 's most populous nation has recruited the veteran @entity15 midfielder as a global ambassador to help promote the @entity11 game both at home and abroad as it combats a serious image problem caused by recent match - fix scandals and the premature departure of two high - profile foreign imports			1
according to a statement released by @entity1 's management , the @entity23 was drawn to the former @entity28 captain 's " credibility as one of the most admired sportsmen and iconic figures in the world as well as his outstanding sportsmanship and professionalism			2

" we are pleased to invite mr. @entity1 to visit @entity11 at this special moment , " said a @entity23 official , who was not named			1
" while in @entity11 , he will attend the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and visit clubs to get a deeper insight into football in @entity11			2
" he will also help us to inspire and motivate many children to participate in this beautiful game			0
" @entity1 will hope to improve the reputation of @entity11 football , which has been blighted by numerous scandals			1
last month @entity76 was stripped of the @entity67 title it won in 2003 as part of a crackdown on match - fixing which also saw 33 lifetime bans from the sport handed out			1
" there has been major corruption in the past but there have been some severe punishments of late , " @entity84 football writer @entity83 told @entity0			0
" consequently , the situation seems to be much better			0
the game is cleaner and sponsors and fans have returned			0

" @entity100 made headlines around the world after embarking on a recruitment drive which included the signings of strikers @entity105 and @entity107 from @entity109 club @entity108 , which won the @entity110 last season			1

other stars followed in their footsteps ... the two just went to the wrong club , perhaps the worst - run club in @entity11			1
