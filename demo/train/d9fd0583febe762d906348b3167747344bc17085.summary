@entity0 -- as we try to grasp the enormity of the crisis involving at least 57,000 unaccompanied minors from @entity7 who crossed the @entity2 - @entity9 border looking for safe haven , @entity2 should stop casting blame and be realistic			1
we always look for an endpoint , a limit , a boundary			0
when we 're told about a budget shortfall , we want the exact numbers so we can assess the damage			0
we 'll settle for an approximation			0
" give me a ballpark figure , " we say			0
but sometimes , it 's not that simple			0
recently , my sources in @entity23 who have been close to the border kids story since the start -- and have batted 1.000 in terms of the accuracy of their reports -- have been giving me a dire warning			1
it 's the equivalent of : " you ai n't seen nothing yet			2
" many @entity2 are angry and frustrated over the government 's handling of the border kids calamity			1
the @entity38 administration -- which , according to @entity23 gov. @entity39 , was warned by state officials in the @entity23 that this was happening as early as 2012 and obviously did n't do enough to prepare -- estimates that by the end of this year , as many as 90,000 young people will have crossed the border into the @entity44			1
opinion : send @entity2 marshals to the border then there are the tag - alongs			1
looking for jobs , and seizing on the opportunity presented by the fact that so many border patrol agents are preoccupied caring for the children , an unknown number of adults from @entity9 are riding the kids ' coattails right into the @entity2			1
it 's a total mess			0
but what if what we 're witnessing now is just the beginning ? what if the real wave is yet to come ? my sources tell me that it is well - known that in the @entity70 , there are tens or even hundreds of thousands of people from @entity7 -- mostly women and children -- in northern @entity9 right now , waiting for their chance to cross into the @entity2			1
we should stop looking for an endpoint			0
this story has no end in sight			0
as a journalist , every week , i start with a dozen new angles to explore			0
by the beginning of next week , there will be a dozen more			0
we will be dealing with this crisis not for weeks or months but probably for years			2
and with every wave , new angles will appear			0
it is hubris for @entity2 officials to believe that any one course of action can stop the flood of desperate people fleeing violence , poverty and oppression			1
the most we can hope for is to be able to manage this crisis for the next few years			2
only six weeks ago , this story was limited to how we were going to respond to a mass exodus of brave and desperate children and teenagers being ferried across the @entity2 - @entity9 border by unscrupulous @entity9 smugglers after escaping the clutches of ruthless street gangs in @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			1
then it grew to involve the perils of a porous border and the litany of horrible things that can happen , on both sides of the line , when you advertise to the world that your country 's backdoor is unlocked and you do n't have the manpower to keep order and prevent violence , crime and lawlessness			1
now that -- heaven help the children -- the politicians have become involved , the story has become about how neither the @entity132 nor @entity133 , neither @entity134 nor @entity135 , have the foggiest idea about how to deal with the problem , since all we 're hearing are bad and simplistic solutions that tell us that most of our leaders do n't know the first thing about what they see as the foreign world of the @entity2 - @entity9 border			1
speaking of simplistic solutions , the @entity38 administration this week deported the first batch of undocumented women and children to @entity110			2
do n't expect the deportees to even bother unpacking			2
unless the horrendous violence and poverty that pushed them out has been magically eradicated in the past several months , they will soon return to the @entity2			1
opinion : what @entity38 could learn on the border here 's what this chapter of the story is really about : the scope of the problem			2
it 's about numbers and tally sheets that we 're afraid to imagine			0
it 's about how many people will come and how long this surge will go on			2
many @entity2 , particularly those in the @entity44 , are in full panic mode			1
and so they 're doing what they always do in the face of adversity : they 're digging in their heels , rolling up their sleeves , stiffening their backbones -- and blaming @entity9			0
they demand to know why @entity9 is n't stopping the border kids from going north			1
to be fair , from media reports and interviews with @entity7 kids who tried to get out but were captured in @entity9 and deported back home , it does seem like our neighbor is stopping some of them			2
yet @entity9 could n't stop all of these kids at its southern border any more than we could stop them at ours			1
there are just too many of them			0
in both countries , we 're learning the same lesson : walls and guards ca n't stop the determined and the desperate , the oppressed and the hungry			2
@entity2 could n't stop the first wave of child refugees , and it 's not clear if we can stop the second or third			1
but let 's at least be ready for it and make sure we do n't repeat our mistakes			0
politicians like to talk about how we have to " do right " by these kids , but doing the right thing requires staying ahead of this story and bracing for the least desirable outcome			0
let 's stop looking for simple solutions and a finish line			0
this crisis does n't have either one			1
join us on @entity217 / @entity216 .			0
