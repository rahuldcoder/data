@entity0 -- president @entity2 says @entity3 had a group of supporters within @entity6 helping to keep the @entity8 leader secure for years , despite an @entity10 - led international manhunt that extended for nearly a decade with @entity12 's ostensible support			1
top @entity10 officials insist @entity6 remains a critical @entity10 ally in the fight against terrorism , but are demanding answers to troubling questions about @entity3 's presence in that country over the course of the last six years			1
" we think that there had to be some sort of support network for @entity3 inside of @entity6 , " @entity2 said in a " @entity24 " interview airing sunday on @entity23			1
" but we do n't know who or what that support network was			2
" the president said @entity10 officials " do n't know whether there might have been some people inside of government ( or ) people outside of government , and that 's something that we have to investigate			1
" " more importantly , " he added , " the @entity6 government has to investigate			2
" @entity6 authorities have " indicated they have a profound interest in finding out what kinds of support networks @entity3 might have had , " @entity2 noted			1
" but these are questions that we 're not going to be able to answer " immediately after the raid on @entity3 's compound			2
" it 's going to take some time for us to be able to exploit the intelligence that we were able to gather on site , " he said			0
@entity6 leaders insist they did n't take part in either the establishment or the maintenance of @entity3 's safe haven , and have promised a full examination of the circumstances that allowed him to spend years in @entity61 , a city with a heavy military presence located a mere 30 miles north of the country 's capital			1
asked by @entity1 's @entity66 whether @entity3 's presence in @entity6 could be chalked up to " duplicity or incompetence , " @entity6 's @entity10 ambassador , @entity65 , said sunday he could n't provide an explanation			1
" i think the best way to move forward is to wait for the findings of an internal ( investigation ) -- a look at the issue , " @entity65 said			0
" i do not think that speculation is going to solve any problem			0
" @entity6 's government " did not have a policy of protecting these people , " he asserted during an interview on @entity80 's " @entity79			1
" @entity2 's national security adviser , @entity84 , told @entity1 's @entity85 he has not seen any information to indicate @entity6 officials knew @entity3 was living in @entity61			1
but if evidence is discovered that is " highly disturbing , we 'll certainly press that , " he said			0
@entity84 's comments came amid calls in @entity94 and elsewhere to cut @entity10 financial assistance in @entity6 , which currently receives roughly $ 1.5 billion in annual aid			1
last week , cia director @entity97 -- nominated by @entity2 to succeed @entity98 as defense secretary -- told @entity101 members during a closed - door briefing that @entity6 was " either involved or incompetent , " according to two sources in attendance			1
" we 'll clearly be working with ( @entity6 authorities ) to understand how we got to this point , " @entity84 said			1
he stressed , however , that " more terrorists and extremists have been captured or killed ( in @entity6 ) than any other place in the world			2
" " we need to look at this in a calm and cool way , " he said			0
there is a lot " at stake in that region			0
" " questions are being raised quite aggressively in @entity6 , " @entity84 later added on @entity80 's " @entity79			2
" authorities there " need to do an investigation			2
" @entity122 's @entity121 , the top @entity123 on the @entity124 , told @entity1 it seems " very logical " that " a lot of people in @entity6 knew about ( @entity3 's ) whereabouts			1
" but @entity121 dismissed calls to cut @entity6 's financial aid			1
like @entity84 , he stressed the reality that @entity6 remains a " critical factor in the war against terror			2
" among other things , @entity121 highlighted the importance of keeping @entity12 's nuclear arsenal secure , and out of the hands of @entity139 or other extremists			0
sen. @entity140 , @entity141 , the chairman of the committee , expressed optimism that the uproar over @entity3 's presence in @entity61 will allow @entity10 and @entity6 leaders to " punch a reset button " in their relationship			1
" hopefully ( now ) there can be a readjustment , " he said on @entity23 's " @entity149			0
" @entity140 noted @entity6 's past assistance in the @entity10 fight against terrorism , including its willingness to allow @entity10 predator drone strikes within its borders			1
former @entity157 cia director @entity157 appeared to agree with @entity140 's assessment of the situation created by the raid			0
" this may be an opportunity to reboot this relationship with @entity6 , and get them to be more aggressive in going after these common targets , " @entity157 said during an appearance on @entity163 's " @entity162			2
" " even if @entity6 was not complicit in providing the safe haven " to @entity3 , " they certainly fell well short of what it was we thought or perhaps they think they should be , " he said			2
@entity65 said on " @entity79 " that @entity12 would have taken action if any member of the @entity6 civilian government , military , or intelligence service knew @entity3 's location			1
he conceded there had been a failure on the part of his government , and said an investigation is already ongoing			0
" heads will roll " once it 's completed , @entity65 promised			2
the investigation " will lead wherever it will lead			0
" @entity6 " wants to put to rest any misgivings the world has about our role " in the fight against terrorism , he said			0
as part of that effort , @entity6 interior minister @entity195 met with a number of senior @entity200 officials over the weekend , including @entity201			0
the officials discussed , among other things , the changing security situation after the @entity10 raid on @entity3 's compound			1
@entity6 's prime minister , @entity207 , is expected to deliver a new terrorism - related policy statement monday as the @entity6 parliament opens a debate on the @entity10 raid			1
during his appearance on @entity80 , @entity65 acknowledged deep social and political divisions in his country			0
@entity6 remains a hotbed of anti- @entity10 sentiment and is home to a large number of people with sympathy for @entity3			1
" @entity221 has - beens " are " still alive and kicking , " he said			0
at the same time , however , he noted the substantial time and resources @entity0 has devoted to the wars in @entity225 and @entity226 -- countries many analysts see as less critical fronts in the war against @entity8 and similar organizations			0
he also blasted the @entity10 government 's willingness to conduct a raid in @entity6 without @entity12 's awareness or consent			1
" what we are offended by is the violation of our sovereignty , " he said			0
" @entity10 has a selling job to do in @entity6			2
" later , @entity65 told @entity1 that @entity0 needs to do more to acknowledge @entity6 's contributions in the war against @entity8 and other terrorist elements			1
the @entity10 needs " to show respect ... for what @entity6 has done , " he said			2
" @entity6 has sacrificed thousands of lives in fighting terrorism			0
" @entity65 criticized what he characterized as " a strange mood " in @entity0			0
" every time something goes wrong with @entity6 , there is open season on @entity6 , " he said			0
the relationship between @entity0 and @entity12 is " based on mutual need , " he said			0
" constantly bashing us " does n't help the situation			0
@entity1 's @entity257 , @entity258 , and @entity259 contributed to this report			0
