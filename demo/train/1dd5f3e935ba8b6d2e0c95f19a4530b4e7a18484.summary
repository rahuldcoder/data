-- the air in and around @entity2 is electrified with anticipation -- and anxiety			1
@entity6 members arrive at the @entity2 convention center during preparations for @entity9			1
nervous is how @entity11 says he is feeling			0
nervous and stressed at the prospect of having to survive and rebuild in the wake of another hurricane			2
as friday 's third anniversary of @entity17 's landfall passed , the @entity2 found itself potentially in the cross hairs of another destructive storm , @entity9			1
residents are suspended in a wait - and - see mode , with an evacuation order for @entity2 likely to come sometime after saturday , according to mayor @entity23			1
@entity11 and his family live in a low - lying area in the town of @entity27 , near @entity28 , just outside @entity2			1
after @entity17 and a drawn - out evacuation , @entity11 and his wife spent nine taxing months living in various places , sometimes apart			1
then , they went through the challenge of dealing with insurance companies and contractors over the phone , waiting for the various bureaucracies involved to do their part			0
now they face the prospect that it might happen all over again			2
and they are not alone			0
" the city is in a little bit of a panic , " says dr. @entity42 , @entity43 , a clinical associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at @entity46			0
" kind of wherever you go , every tv is turned to the news			0
the news is now reporting nothing else other than the hurricane , and it 's days away			1
people are really heightened in terms of their emotions right now			0
" many @entity2 residents already live on the edge emotionally			2
among @entity17 survivors , @entity2 has a post-traumatic stress disorder rate of more than 25 percent , and a mood and anxiety disorders rate of roughly 35 percent , according to a study published in the journal @entity68 in january			1
the big question is , can the city deal with any mental health fallout should @entity72 get within striking distance ? " thinking about the storm is anxiety - provoking for people			1
it brings them back to a lot of those feelings they had and memories from @entity17 , " says dr. @entity77 , the deputy assistant secretary for the office of mental health at the @entity80			1
" people have memories that are triggered by preparing for this storm			0
" " why did we return ? why did we rebuild ? why is this happening again to us ? all of those thoughts are going through people 's minds , " says dr. @entity89 , an associate professor of emergency medicine at @entity92 's @entity91 at @entity2			1
" people are certainly anxious and doubting themselves			0
" but there is a small silver lining to all the attention @entity72 is generating			0
@entity42 , who also serves as the director of the @entity101 , says that although the anxiety brought on by @entity9 is " definitely a bad thing , " it is spurring better preparedness			0
" in terms of the prep , it 's great , because i really think it 's going to be a different ball game than it was three years ago			2
" there is no doubt that the city is better prepared overall than it was for @entity17			2
but in mental health services , many holes still exist			1
after the storm , the city lost -- and has n't completely replaced -- many of its hospital beds devoted to mental health , and also many of its psychiatrists , psychologists and social workers , leaving it ill - equipped to handle its chronic caseload , let alone any spike in mental health care needs brought on by potential stressful events like @entity9			1
" throughout the country , mental health is in crisis , and in areas that are impoverished and recently devastated like @entity2 , they are certainly struggling , " says @entity89 , who is also an @entity132 physician at the @entity92 emergency department at the @entity134 in @entity2			1
@entity89 says the city 's mental health system that ca n't provide care for its chronic level of illness , let alone for any surge in demand			1
@entity42 agrees that the city has not recovered			2
" mental - health wise , absolutely not			2
the number of providers is still far below what 's needed , " he says			2
still , @entity2 is not a complete wasteland in terms of mental health services			1
@entity154 is the state - run counseling program funded by @entity156			0
" we 've been on the ground since @entity17 and have been providing mental health and emotional recovery services , " says @entity77 , who directs @entity154			1
he says the agency has about 215 counselors who service the parishes in and around @entity2			2
" we have provided individual counseling visits to over a quarter - million people and we 've generated probably 2.5 million to 3 million contacts -- many people we see more than once			0
the primary part of their work [ is ] meeting with survivors , going to their neighborhoods , homes , community centers , and educating people about emergency preparedness , about coping with the recovery process , about getting their homes and lives back together			0
" as for @entity11 , he says he and his wife are dealing with the specter of @entity9 with humor , mostly for the sake of his eldest daughter , now 9 , who is anxious about losing her friends and her toys all over again			0
" we 're just trying to be as funny as possible and keep it in as light a mood as possible while we 're biting our nails			0
we 're worrying amongst ourselves and eating junk food as relief			0
" he jokes that they have n't hit the bourbon yet , but they are defrosting the freezer , where a gallon of daiquiris await			0
