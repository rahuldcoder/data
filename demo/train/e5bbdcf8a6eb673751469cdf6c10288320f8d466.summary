referring to president @entity48 , some in the crowds chanted , " with our blood , with our souls , we will sacrifice for you , @entity47 " and " @entity53 , @entity4 and @entity47 only			1
" the world 's attention has been focused on the plight of @entity4 displaced from their homes by violence			1
at least 10,718 @entity4 refugees , many of whom fled a military advance in and around the city of @entity64 , have crossed the border into @entity66			1
the @entity68 refugee agency tuesday said it participated in a government - sponsored mission to @entity64 the day before , a trip that included diplomats , reporters and @entity68 agencies			0
the group " approached @entity64 from @entity75 to the east " and " villages were increasingly empty from around 40 kilometers away from @entity64			0
" " there was no evidence of people working in the fields			0
@entity64 itself was almost deserted , with most shops shuttered and closed			0
" the agency said the fact that @entity64 and nearby villages were " empty indicates significant displacement			0
" the @entity68 high commissioner for refugees said 500 to 1,000 people have been crossing from @entity4 into @entity66 daily since june 7			1
it also praised @entity66 and the @entity91 whose efforts " to provide protection and shelter and cater for the needs of @entity4 refugees were commendable			1

it 's the second known amnesty overture from the embattled @entity4 leader since protests erupted in march , and it concerns any alleged unlawful acts that occurred before monday			1
@entity187 issued a similar amnesty on may 31 that included the arrests of people belonging to various political groups			0
but that offer and mentions of reform in a rare public speech monday have done little to quell widespread anger toward @entity48 's regime			0
on monday , @entity48 offered vague promises of reform and called for refugees to go back home			2
@entity187 said he was " working on getting the military back to their barracks as soon as possible " but also warned the government would " work on tracking down everyone who shed blood or plotted in shedding the blood of the @entity4 people , and we will hold them accountable			2

@entity187 blamed armed gangs and conspiracies for the violence that has gripped @entity4 , saying the unrest has tarnished the country 's image and weakened its security			2
" there are those who are killing in the name of religion and want to spread chaos under the pretext of religion , " he said , referring to conspiracies as " germs " that can not be " exterminated			0
" the speech was met with demonstrations in a number of @entity4 towns and cities , opponents of the government said			2
