@entity0 -- the @entity2 and @entity3 are discussing the possible release of @entity3 spy @entity5 as part of efforts to save fragile @entity9 peace negotiations , according to sources familiar with the talks			1
no decisions have been made about @entity5 's release , which the sources cautioned was far from certain and would need to be approved by president @entity14			2
@entity5 's possible release was being discussed as part of a broader agreement that had not been finalized			2
talk of @entity5 's possible release came as secretary of state @entity19 traveled to @entity3 monday to try and mediate a dispute between @entity3 and the @entity21 over the release of @entity21 prisoners			1
in exchange for @entity5 's release , the sources said that @entity3 would have to make significant concessions to the @entity21 , which could include a settlement freeze , the release of additional prisoners beyond the current group in dispute and an agreement to continue peace negotiations beyond the end of april deadline			1
@entity5 , a former @entity2 intelligence analyst arrested and charged with spying for @entity3 , was convicted in 1987 and is currently serving out a life sentence in the @entity2			1
his imprisonment has been a source of tension between the @entity2 and @entity3			2
but with peace talks between @entity3 and the @entity21 faltering , his release is being considered as a possible incentive for @entity3 concessions			0
@entity3 has in the past tried to link @entity5 's release to peace negotiations			1
current and former @entity2 officials and experts have suggested the @entity2 government might tie his release to a comprehensive peace deal between the @entity3 and @entity21			1
@entity5 is up for parole consideration in november 2015 , and the @entity2 is running out of time to use his possible release as leverage with @entity3			1
at the @entity55 briefing monday , press secretary @entity53 said it is a " complicated issue " and declined to " get into details " about the negotiations			0
" and with regards to mr. @entity5 , he is a person who was convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence , and i do n't have any update on his situation , " @entity53 said			2
but the fact the @entity2 is willing to discuss his release before even a framework agreement has been reached between the parties shows the extraordinary efforts @entity0 is making to salvage the troubled negotiations			2
when asked about whether @entity5 was a topic in @entity19 's talks with @entity3 prime minister @entity73 , @entity70 spokeswoman @entity69 said , " @entity5 was convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence			1
i do not have any update for you on his status			0
" @entity19 met monday with @entity73 and was expected to meet with @entity21 president @entity79 tuesday			0
the negotiations , which began in july , have hit a snag over whether @entity3 will agree to release more than two dozen prisoners , including 14 @entity83 who @entity3 considers terrorists			0
they were scheduled to be freed on march 29 and now @entity21 negotiators are threatening to end the negotiations over the delay			0
@entity3 has already released three groups of prisoners , most of whom have served lengthy prison terms for attacks on @entity3 , but this final release is especially contentious because it includes convicted murderers			0
@entity73 has said he would seek approval for any further releases with his cabinet , which has been critical of the previous releases			0
@entity73 has also said he would not release any more prisoners if president @entity79 did not agree to continue negotiations and to stop threatening to seek recognition for @entity21 before international bodies .			0
