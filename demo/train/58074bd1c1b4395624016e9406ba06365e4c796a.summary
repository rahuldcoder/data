dramatic surveillance camera video shows a @entity2 pilot running to a jet that , once set in motion , clips an airport building in last july 's bizarre incident involving pilot @entity8 , who stole the plane while being sought on suspicion that he had killed his former girlfriend			1
@entity8 , 40 , set the empty regional jet in motion on the tarmac of the closed airport , and then killed himself with a gunshot to the head , officials concluded			1
but investigators were not able to answer several questions that have confounded people since the july 18 incident , including whether @entity8 intended to take off in the plane , and if so , what he intended to do with it			1
" the answer to that is ' we 'll never know , ' " said @entity25 , @entity26 , city spokesman @entity27			1
police reports released in recent days , however , leave open the possibility that @entity8 intended to take off in the aircraft			2
but he may have been foiled when a safety clip on the landing gear was damaged , leaving him unable to steer the plane on the ground			0
the plane rolled a short distance , its wing clipping the terminal building , before crashing through a fence and ramming into a half - dozen cars			2
evidence indicates that while the plane was in motion , @entity8 left the cockpit , entered the cabin and shot himself in the head			1
authorities in @entity25 , @entity26 , released the surveillance video this week			1
had @entity8 gotten the plane aloft at @entity53 , the regional jet -- a crj 200 -- contained enough fuel to fly for about 50 minutes , according to the police report			1
a cockpit voice recorder did not provide much information to investigators , the police reports say			0
the recorder contains only the voices of pilots who flew a previous flight , and sounds of " some rustling in the cockpit and heaving breathing that is assumed to be @entity71			0
" " what his ultimate motive is is really unclear , " @entity27 said			1
" i 'm not going to speculate , but obviously he was intending to take the plane off or he was trying to cause as much damage as possible			0
" @entity8 had been a pilot with the airline since 2005			2
police who were among the first at the crash site described a bizarre and confusing scene			0
the plane was tilted forward , its nose gear collapsed			0
the engines were still screaming and several cars were wedged under and around the wings			0
the plane 's doors were shut and there was no indication that anyone was on the aircraft			0
when a firefighter told police that someone was on the plane , officers entered with guns drawn and found @entity8 , wearing a green jump suit , lying in the aisle with a gun near his feet			1
police soon learned the identity of the man , and found out that he was a suspect in his former girlfriend 's murder and that he had military experience -- two factors that prompted them to send a bomb squad on a thorough search of the plane			2
@entity8 's former girlfriend , @entity117 , 39 , had been found dead the previous friday in @entity118			1
both @entity8 and @entity117 had served in the @entity120 , officials said			2
@entity117 was found at @entity8 's residence , but authorities do n't know whether she went there voluntarily or was abducted , @entity118 @entity105 spokeswoman @entity121 told @entity124 at the time			2
a coroner said @entity117 died of multiple stab wounds			0
@entity8 was immediately identified as a suspect			0
" detectives went so far as to contact @entity2 and have them deactivate mr. @entity8 's access cards in the event he showed up there , " police said			1
@entity8 's motorcycle was found outside the @entity25 airport , and authorities say they believe he used a rug to climb over the airport 's barbed wire fence			1
the @entity139 declined any update on the investigation			0
" although the @entity139 responded to the incident in @entity25 this past summer , at this point we are not making any further comments on the matter , " said spokeswoman @entity142 .			0
