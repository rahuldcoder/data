-- i feel like a short - order cook flipping a pancake , looking at it in the air from side to side , to see how well done it is , to see if it is ready			2
there are plusses and minuses to every statement made by a celebrity			2
i am a great fan of @entity18 , especially of his hair , but i still want to be honest about what i think of the message he recently sent to @entity23 , on whose blog he came out on monday			1
it 's a pancake with two sides , and it 's still up in the air			2
on one side , @entity18 joins a long troupe of people like @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and on back down the line , for which the @entity35 has got to be seen as made , perhaps , for the sea whelks and the @entity38 statues who do n't get @entity0 at home and do n't notice sexuality and its cues			1
i mean , there may yet be a population of creatures on the planet surprised that @entity18 is gay , but i suspect they eat plankton			1
my take : will there be gays in heaven ? on the other side , honesty still takes courage , and one of the things that a bright cunning professional with good hair does when he or she comes out is to encourage other gay or lesbian people with good hair to let it down , too			1
what i like better than @entity18 's admission , or the good reasons he summarizes for making such an admission , is his insistence that even under these circumstances he has a right to a private life , and he intends to invoke those rights			1
i have generally resisted being identified as a gay spokesperson , even though i am gay and i do speak			1
and have political opinions , and i use them in my writing			2
( i have n't got the hair to be a gay spokesperson , though			2
) less facetiously , the truth is that i could not stomach being a professional gay spokesperson because i have never been a professional homosexual			2
i am only a professional writer , and as such -- just as @entity18 attests , too , about himself -- my sexuality is a real but a limited part of my character			1
it is something that has helped define me as an artist in that it taught me how to stand on the margins and scrutinize the center			2
news : @entity18 says he 's gay , happy and proud incidentally , so , too , has being a @entity89 in this dark season of @entity89 instability , hysteria and political game - playing			1
so , too , has being married to a man with whom i have adopted three brown - skinned kids			0
so , too , is believing that the physicality of books matters			0
also , believing in not being a one - issue voter			0
all these aspects of my self marginalize me , but they do n't make me a @entity89 writer , a gay writer , a blended - family writer , a nut - job			2
they make me a better writer , because they round me out			0
they fill me with contradictory and complicating sympathies			0
they make me work harder at being myself			0
so , the pancake is still in the air			0
will @entity18 be a better professional journalist for having been honest in this aspect of his life ? i do n't know that anyone can be sure of this , him least of all			1
celebs , readers proud of @entity18 but that is why , in the end , the pancake flips onto a plate ready for serving in a pool of warm maple syrup , and it looks just right			1
he is willing to take the chance that he might be marginalized for this			0
he thinks it is important enough to risk being belittled , even by an admirer , like me			0
maybe @entity18 holds close to his heart a maxim that i do			1
it 's by @entity130 , one of my own local heroes			1
he wrote " character is centrality , the impossibility of being displaced or overset			1
" when i was about 17 , i stitched those words into some invisible vest pocket of my psychic armor and said to myself : " you do n't have to tell all the truth			0
you just have to be sure not to lie			0
do not do anything that will cause you to be displaced or overset			0
be central upon the limited , unorthodox , marginalized square upon which , through no doing of your own , you find that you stand			0
" news : @entity145 : what happened after i came out here 's your pancake			0
it has a face in it ! a holy miracle			0
it is n't the face of @entity18 and it is n't even the face of @entity156 ( who also has great hair )			1
it 's good for you			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			1

@entity165 : most people knew @entity18 was gay ; he came out monday
he likes that @entity18 insists that he still *deserves* privacy
he says like @entity171 , he knows that being gay is one part of the many qualities that define him
@entity165 : @entity130 said " character is centrality ; " maybe @entity18 believes this , too
