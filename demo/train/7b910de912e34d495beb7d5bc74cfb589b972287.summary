@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the early 1990 's , i was listening to the @entity5 radio show when a young man from @entity7 , @entity8 , called in to complain about ... well , life			1
the caller was upset that , since the steel mills had closed years earlier , there was no opportunity for him in his beloved hometown			2
@entity7 was where his father and grandfather had raised families and where he had hoped to raise his own			2
so he was attracted to the protectionist rhetoric of presidential candidates promising to erect trade barriers in the hopes of resurrecting @entity24 cities			2
but , short of attending a political rally , the young man from @entity7 did n't know what to do			1
noting that our most daunting obstacles are often self - imposed , @entity5 gave the caller some simple but valuable advice : " move ! " brilliant			1
but moving is n't always easy			2
at various moments , some of us have felt inextricably bound to our hometowns by a loyalty that defies logic			2
yet , especially in a sour economy , it can also be self - defeating			2
now i read about a new trend : more and more @entity24 are responding to the wobbly @entity24 economy by fleeing the country			2
it seems that when the @entity24 job market gets tough , the desperate get going -- to wherever the jobs happen to be			1
according to a recent article in @entity49 , with the nation 's unemployment rate at a 26 - year - high of 10.2 percent , many @entity24 are looking for jobs outside the country			1
in fact , @entity24 - based staffing companies and executive search firms say that the job outlook abroad looks brighter than it does here			1
the most welcoming job markets : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62			1
the jobs that are most often taking people abroad : engineering , management or consulting			1
as the article points out , a survey by @entity69 found that 54 percent of executives said they 'd be either likely or highly likely to accept a post in a foreign country			2
four years ago , in better times , it was just 37 percent			2
at @entity78 's @entity77 , 24 percent of 2009 graduates found jobs overseas , a jump from 19 percent last year			1
sure , leaving the @entity24 is an extreme measure			0
i 'd be happy if most @entity24 were more willing to just leave their comfort zone			0
if you 're unemployed , the secret to survival is to know where to go -- and where to steer clear of			0
according to one set of job growth projections , in 2010 the three most promising states will be @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 -- with @entity95 , @entity96 , and @entity97 not far behind			1
the three least promising will be @entity98 , @entity99 , and @entity100 -- with @entity1 , @entity101 , and @entity102 not much better off			0
for me , this subject hits close to home			0
you see , i was once just like the guy from @entity7			0
i was in love with a hometown ( @entity110 , a small town in central @entity1 ) that could n't sustain my ambition			0
after graduating from college on the @entity114 , i rushed home			0
eventually , reality set in and i spent my 20s bouncing back and forth to @entity118 , a much larger market , for one job or another			1
finally , when i turned 30 , i said goodbye to @entity1 and took my first reporting job at a newspaper in @entity123			1
i moved four times in my 30s -- from @entity110 to @entity126 to @entity127 to @entity128 to @entity0			0
the lesson i learned along the way : jobs do n't just come to you			1
more often , you have to go to the job			1
too many @entity24 resist that truth and instead wait for their dream jobs to come knocking at their door			1
they treat the idea of living in a certain city or state as an entitlement that they 're not willing to surrender			0
a few months ago , i found myself having lunch next to a middle - aged man who told me that , when he was starting his business , he had moved all around the country until he arrived at what he considered the destination city of @entity148 , @entity1 -- north of @entity0			0
he was frustrated because his son , who had grown up in that ritzy zip code , was now in his early 20s and considered it his birthright to keep living there			0
shaking his head , the man said : " he does n't understand that i had to work my whole life to get here , and that he has to move to a more affordable city and work his way back			1
" multiply that story by 10 million , and you get a sense for what we 're up against			0
here again , the native - born could learn from immigrants , foreign students , and anyone else who has the moxie to leave behind family , friends , and the familiar in search of a better life			0
those people may struggle , but they 'll survive and get ahead			1
it has always been this way			0
and in a global economy , this is how it will remain for as far as the eye can see			0
the sooner @entity24 accept that , the better off they 'll be			0
the better off we 'll all be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184			1

many people stay put in economic *downturn* , wedded to their *communities*
@entity184 says young people should move to where the jobs are
he says more americans are taking jobs overseas *due* to *recession*
