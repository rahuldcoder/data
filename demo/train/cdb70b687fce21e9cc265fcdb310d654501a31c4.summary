@entity0 is confronting a problem beyond the @entity3 rockets screeching overhead -- a threat underfoot			1
the @entity0 military says it is trying to demolish a sophisticated network of tunnels that run through parts of northeast @entity9 , under the border and into southern @entity0			1
@entity3 has already used the tunnels several times in the past few days to attempt assaults on @entity0 soil			1
the first attack , on july 17 , was foiled but prompted @entity0 to announce a ground incursion into @entity9 with the stated aim of taking out the tunnels			1
another assault through tunnels s few days later resulted in clashes that killed more than 10 @entity3 fighters and four @entity0 soldiers			1
the assault near the town of @entity26 appeared to target two communal areas " where farmers are trying to conduct their daily lives , " said @entity0 government spokesman @entity30			0
the @entity3 fighters were disguised as @entity0 soldiers , according to the @entity33			2
the clashes forced area roads to close , residents to shelter in their homes and tied up security forces for hours			0
the method of attack , in which militants spring out unexpectedly from underground , has struck fear into @entity0 living near @entity9			2
" your enemy is about to blast his way into your dining room from below the floor while you are feeding your family			0
sounds like a b - rated horror movie , right ? this scenario is one real example of a @entity3 tunnel discovered just in time by the @entity33 leading into a kibbutz communal dining hall , " @entity51 , a volunteer medic and grandmother who lives in @entity53 , told @entity54			1
' @entity9 ' the tunnel network has also been used during combat inside @entity9 , the @entity0 military says , allowing @entity3 fighters to pop up and fire on soldiers or toss grenades before dropping back out of sight			1
@entity0 military officials refer to the underground works as " @entity9 " and suggest at least some of the war is being waged underground			1
the tunnels are n't a new phenomenon			0
@entity3 used one in 2006 to capture the @entity0 soldier @entity73 and take him back into @entity9			1
he was held captive for five years until a deal was struck for his release in exchange for more than 1,000 @entity78 prisoners			0
memories of his capture were revived by a foiled attack over the weekend , in which one @entity3 fighter who entered @entity0 through a tunnel was found to be carrying tranquilizers and handcuffs , according to the @entity0 military			1
' a whole industry ' @entity0 received a warning of the growing scale and sophistication of the underground threat last year with the discovery of a tunnel that ran from the @entity94 refugee camp in @entity9 and emerged near the @entity0 kibbutz of @entity96			1
uncovered in october , the tunnel was wired for electricity and communications			0
it was also high enough for a man to stand , walk or run through			0
it was long , about 1.7 kilometers ( roughly one mile ) , and deep , at least 18 meters ( 59 feet )			0
its interior was fully lined with an estimated 500 tons of concrete			0
" we 're talking about a whole industry , and not a small group that 's organizing it , " maj. gen @entity106 , commander of the @entity33 @entity107 , said at the time			0
@entity0 responded by halting supplies of concrete and construction materials into @entity9 , tightening an already restrictive blockade			2
large network but the current conflict suggests that tunnel building has continued at a steady clip			0
the @entity0 military says that during its incursion into @entity9 , it has so far found scores of different access shafts leading to about 30 tunnels			1
some of the entry points were underneath people 's houses , officials said , and @entity0 military uniforms were stashed inside some of the tunnels			1
the @entity33 said it has destroyed about half the known tunnels so far with controlled explosions or heavy earth - moving equipment			0
the substantial construction of the tunnels , some of which stretch for kilometers , has made them difficult to demolish , @entity0 military officials said			1
" we 're taking action right now to neutralize those tunnels and we 'll continue the action as long as necessary , " @entity0 prime minister @entity141 said last week			2
the @entity0 military says it believes there are " tens " of tunnels still to be found -- and some of the fiercest fighting it has encountered has been around the tunnel entrances , suggesting a strong desire by @entity3 to hold onto them and protect them			1
smuggling tunnels @entity3 started off using tunnels to burrow under different @entity9 border -- the one with @entity156			1
the aim of those tunnels was n't to mount attacks , but to ferry goods			0
the underground routes into @entity156 were a way to circumvent the @entity0 blockade on @entity9			2
the @entity9 - @entity156 tunnels " are used to bring in food , to bring in gas , livestock , anything else that the @entity168 need			2
and also , according to @entity0 , are used to resupply @entity3			2
that is how they get their weapons into @entity9 within this blockade , " said @entity54 's @entity170 , who visited some of the tunnels in 2009			2
despite efforts by both @entity0 and @entity156 to crack down on the smuggling tunnels , they 've proved hard to stamp out			2
" they 've been bombing these tunnels between @entity9 and @entity156 for years and still they keep popping up , " @entity170 said			0
" they 're very , very basic , very dirty , but they are very quick to create			0
" @entity0 's current effort to destroy the tunnels into its own territory is taking a heavy toll -- on @entity189 civilians and @entity0 soldiers			0
the question is whether the incursion will remove the threat for good .			0

@entity3 has used tunnels to stage attacks in @entity0 and @entity9 , the @entity0 military says
the military has destroyed some tunnels , but says it believes there are many more
@entity3 used a tunnel to capture an @entity0 soldier in 2006
a tunnel into @entity0 discovered last year showed *increasing* sophistication
