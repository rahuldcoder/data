when it comes to @entity2 and the @entity3 , the relationship has been convoluted for decades			1
and this deal is no different			0
after days of negotiations , six world powers and @entity7 reached an agreement that calls on @entity2 to limit its nuclear activities in return for lighter sanctions			1
it 's complicated politics coupled with complicated science			0
here 's a quick primer to get you up to speed			0
how did @entity2 's nuclear program start ? the @entity19 launched a nuclear program with @entity2 in 1957			1
back then , the @entity21 ruled @entity2 and the two countries were still friends			2
with backing from the @entity19 , @entity2 started developing its nuclear power program in the 1970s			1
but the @entity19 pulled its support when the @entity21 was overthrown during the @entity26 in 1979			1
who are these ' six world powers ' ? the talks involved the @entity31 group comprising diplomats from the five permanent members of the @entity34 : @entity19 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , plus @entity39 -- and of course @entity2			1
the group has been meeting in @entity42 for days in hopes of reaching a diplomatic solution			0
@entity46 ) is @entity2 the only nation with a nuclear program ? no. eight nations are known to have nuclear weapons , including all the @entity31 countries			1
nearby @entity52 has always declined to confirm whether it has any , although the @entity53 estimates it has about 80 atomic weapons			1
but since the 1979 revolution , concerns have escalated that @entity2 could enrich uranium and make atomic weapons			1
@entity2 has maintained its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes			1
why have the other nations not faced as much scrutiny ? for nations such as @entity65 and @entity66 , no action was taken partly because they never signed the @entity68			0
" there was very little that the @entity19 could 've done to stop @entity66 , " says @entity69 , a nuclear policy expert at the @entity71			1
@entity2 , on the other hand , signed the treaty			2
and as a result , its program was put under the spotlight			0
in addition , the @entity78 had information suggesting @entity2 conducted activities it has n't declared in the past			2
@entity83 : what critics are getting wrong about the @entity2 deal why is @entity2 's nuclear program considered such a threat ? since its revolution , the @entity3 has worried @entity2 could use its nuclear program to produce atomic weapons using highly - enriched uranium			1
a decade ago , nuclear inspectors from the international agency announced they had found traces of highly - enriched uranium at a plant in @entity96			0
@entity2 temporarily halted enrichment , but resumed enriching again in 2006 , insisting enrichment was allowed under its agreement with the @entity78			2
let 's talk about the deal that was reached			2
it 's more of an interim agreement before the deal			2
described as an initial , six - month deal , the @entity106 says it includes " substantial limitations that will help prevent @entity2 from creating a nuclear weapon			1
" in short , it slows the country 's nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanctions while a more formal agreement is worked out			1
it 's not permanent , so why is it a big deal ? for years , @entity2 and @entity117 powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement , frustration and open animosity			1
but the diplomatic tone changed after @entity2 's election this year , which saw president @entity124 take over			1
" for the first time in nearly a decade , we have halted the progress of the @entity2 nuclear program , " @entity19 president @entity125 says			1
what about the stockpiles @entity2 already has ? as part of the deal , @entity2 will be required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20 %			1
while uranium is n't bomb - grade until it 's enriched to 90 % purity , " once you 're at 20 % , you 're about 80 % of the way there , " @entity69 says			0
the deal also mandates @entity2 halt all enrichment above 5 % and dismantle the technical equipment required to do that			1
before the end of the initial phase of the deal , all its stockpiles should be diluted below 5 % or converted to a form not suitable for further enrichment , the deal states			0
breaking down the deal why 5 % ? @entity2 consistently says it 's enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors only for peaceful civilian energy needs			1
nuclear power plants use uranium that is enriched to 5 %			0
it 's the fuel that the plants use to generate electricity			0
what else will @entity2 have to do ? @entity2 would also have to cut back on constructing new centrifuges and enrichment facilities , and freeze essential work on its heavy - water reactor under development at @entity167			2
that facility could be used as a source of plutonium -- a second pathway to a nuclear bomb			2
the reactor under construction southwest of @entity7 had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations			0
what 's a centrifuge ? it 's a mechanism used to enrich uranium			0
how will we know @entity2 is living up to its end of the deal ? @entity2 is expected to provide daily access to inspectors from the international agency , @entity78			1
the inspectors will be expected to visit centrifuge assembly and storage facilities , uranium mills and the @entity167 reactor , among others			0
the @entity31 and @entity2 will also form a joint task force on the issue			2
what if it does n't fulfill its commitment ? the international community will add more sanctions -- and pressure			2
one agreement , wildly different reactions what 's in it for @entity2 ? billions of dollars			1
as part of preliminary steps , the world powers involved in the talks will provide " limited , temporary , targeted , and reversible relief to @entity2			2
" the deal calls for no new nuclear - related sanctions in the six - month period if @entity2 keeps its end of the bargain			1
the world powers will also suspend sanctions on various items , including gold and petrochemical exports			0
that suspension will provide @entity2 with about $ 1.5 billion in revenue , according to the @entity106			2
sanctions relief will also target other areas , including government funds from restricted @entity2 accounts for its students in other countries			1
but the @entity106 says the $ 7 billion in total relief is just a small fraction			0
" the vast majority of @entity2 's approximately $ 100 billion in foreign exchange holdings are inaccessible or restricted by sanctions , " it says			1
what 's not in the deal ? a better deal would have included @entity2 shipping out their highly enriched uranium to be converted elsewhere , says @entity235 , vice president of the @entity236			1
" it would have been better ... if @entity2 had much more of their nuclear infrastructure put out of use			1
but that 's the deal they got			0
" how did the sanctions come to be ? seven years ago , the @entity34 passed sanctions against @entity2 for failing to suspend its nuclear program			1
sanctions that initially targeted @entity2 's nuclear capability expanded to include bans on arms sales , @entity2 oil and certain financial institutions , including the country 's central bank			1
this has crippled its economy and made @entity2 a pariah in the international community			0
oil revenues have plummeted , and the local currency had dropped 80 % in value by 2012			0
@entity2 have faced spiraling inflation and layoffs			0
opinion : @entity2 deal a risk worth taking why is n't @entity52 applauding the deal ? the two nearby countries and archrivals have been at each other 's throats for years			1
@entity52 says it has the most to lose if @entity2 develops a nuclear bomb			1
it has repeatedly warned the @entity3 to tread warily when dealing with @entity7			0
and @entity52 lawmakers are not happy that their greatest ally , the @entity19 , has disregarded their warning and struck an interim deal with @entity2			1
prime minister @entity275 called the agreement a " historic mistake " that his country is n't bound by			0
so much tension between @entity2 and @entity52 , why ? it was n't always this way			0
after the birth of @entity52 in 1948 , the two nations enjoyed a " honeymoon " that lasted until just before the 1979 revolution , says @entity285 , professor emeritus of @entity286			0
@entity52 even supplied weapons to @entity2 to help it fight their common enemy , @entity290			2
but the @entity292 revolution that overthrew the @entity21 marked a turning point			0
the @entity292 republic , led by @entity296 clerics in the predominantly @entity296 nation , saw @entity52 as an illegitimate state with no right to exist , certainly not amid @entity292 nations			0
years later , @entity52 began to regard @entity2 and its support of global terror as a chief threat			2
those concerns escalated when international inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium at a power plant in @entity2			0
@entity309 : @entity52 is safe under new deal who else is unhappy ? @entity312			0
it 's a majority @entity314 country			0
@entity312 , like @entity52 , is troubled by @entity2 's growing clout in the @entity318			1
" the @entity312 government has been very concerned about these negotiations with @entity2 and unhappy at the prospect of a deal with @entity2 , " a @entity312 government official who is not authorized to speak to the media told @entity321			2
so , will this interim deal work ? there are no perfect agreements			0
and the success of any interim deal will be measured " in months and years , not in minutes , " says @entity331 of the @entity71			0
whether @entity2 is serious about mothballing its nuclear ambitions remains to be seen			2
there may be sizable obstacles that are n't yet apparent			0
there are certainly aspects where the deal stopped short			0
for now , @entity235 says , do n't break open the champagne bottles just yet			0
president @entity125 's legacy moment on @entity2			2

@entity19 pulled support of @entity2 's nuclear program during @entity26
since the revolution , the @entity3 has worried @entity2 may produce atomic weapons
@entity36 , @entity19 , @entity35 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 -- and @entity2 -- have been negotiating deal
the deal slows @entity2 's program in exchange for lighter sanctions
