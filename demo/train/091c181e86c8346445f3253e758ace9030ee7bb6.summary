-- @entity2 's oil reserves may have been grossly overestimated and its capacity to continue pumping at current capacity exaggerated , according to a @entity6 diplomatic cable sent from the kingdom in 2007			1
the cable , obtained by @entity9 and published in the @entity11 newspaper @entity10 , cited the views of @entity13 , who had been in charge of exploration and production at the @entity2 state - owned company @entity17 for 12 years until 2004			1
@entity17 dominates exploration and production in the kingdom			2
" according to @entity13 , the crux of the issue is two-fold , " the cable says			0
" first it is possible that @entity2 reserves are not as bountiful as sometimes described and the timeline for their production not as unrestrained as @entity17 executives and energy optimists would like			1
" @entity28 is quoted as disagreeing with his former company 's estimate of total reserves in @entity2 , the world 's largest oil producer			1
" he believes that @entity17 's reserves are overstated by as much as 300 billion barrels of ' speculative resources			1
' he instead focuses on original proven reserves			0
" @entity28 forecasts " a plateau in total output that will last approximately fifteen years , " meaning that soon after 2020 " a slow but steady output decline will ensue and no amount of effort will be able to stop it			2
" the former @entity17 executive 's forecast was based on @entity2 's stated goal of producing 12.5 million barrels per day by 2009			1
industry commentators say it has fallen short of that goal because of the global economic slowdown and insufficient global refining capacity			0
according to the @entity53 , @entity2 produced 8.4 million barrels per day of crude oil in 2010 , and around 1.8 million barrels per day of natural gas			2
but less was available for export because of rapidly increasing domestic demand			0
and as global demand recovers , driven by @entity63 and @entity64 , the price of crude oil has risen sharply			0
in the long term , @entity28 sees an " underlying reality that global demand has met supply , " according to the cable			0
" due to the longer - term constraints on expanding global output , @entity13 judges that demand will continue to outpace supply and that for every million - barrels - per - day shortfall that exists between demand and supply , the floor price will increase by $ 12 ( per barrel ) , " the cable says			2
oil industry observers say that while there have been significant finds of crude in recent years -- especially off the coast of @entity84 and @entity85 -- some fields are in deep water and will be difficult to recover			0
and they are not big enough to alter the fundamental picture with " super-fields " like the @entity91 field in @entity2 beginning to decline			2
however , new reservoir technologies may allow producers to exploit reserves that are currently inaccessible			0
in @entity2 's case , that amounts to an estimated 360 billion barrels			1
oil industry analysts point out another variable : the use of alternative energy sources			0
a @entity6 cable from 2009 says the @entity2 want to develop renewable energy sources , including nuclear power , to meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity			1
that could have the effect of reducing the need to divert crude from exports to fuel domestic electricity generation			0
the 2009 cable says analysts believe " a civilian nuclear program ... is the only possibility the @entity117 has to generate sufficient electricity to meet projected demand from economic and population growth and increasing affluence without wastefully burning large quantities of fuel oil			1
" last year @entity2 announced plans to built two nuclear power plants .			1

@entity6 cables from @entity2 in 2007 were released by @entity9
former @entity17 executive predicted a slow decline in @entity2 oil output after 2020
@entity133 disagreed with estimate of as many as 300 billion barrels of reserves
2009 cable cites analysts who say nuclear power is kingdom 's only *recourse* to meet demand
