-- now that they 've gotten a peek at it , publishers of books , newspapers and magazines are hoping @entity9 's forthcoming @entity8 tablet device will breathe new life into their struggling industry			1
a handful of publishers already have struck content deals with @entity9 for the handheld wireless device , which displays text , photos and graphics in high - res color			1
@entity9 will launch an online bookstore to sell titles for the @entity8 , much like @entity22 sells music for ipods and other @entity9 devices			1
" i think it 's a game - changer for us ... ­ because of the ability to consume content and consume so much of it all in one place , " @entity26 , president of @entity27 , told @entity0			1
she thinks the @entity8 could join @entity36 's popular @entity35 e-reader in boosting demand for digital media			1
" it 's become clear over the life of the @entity41 that people love consuming information like this on their phone -- the people who buy kindles buy more books than before they had a @entity35 " @entity26 added			1
" machines like this make you want to consume more media , which is good for us			2
" @entity54 and others are hoping that the @entity9 's @entity56 and other pay - based models for the @entity8 will do for the print - media industry what @entity22 did for the music industry			1
" we think there 's a lot of opportunity there , " said @entity60 , vice president of corporate communications at publishing house @entity62			0
" it creates a much more robust marketplace			0
the e-book market has clearly been growing at a really rapid clip in the last year			0
i think this will certainly tick it up a notch			0
it expands the universe of potential customers for us in a big way			0
" @entity60 noted the enormous reach @entity9 already has with consumers in the @entity83			2
through @entity9 's online store , @entity62 may be able to reach consumers who have not already bought a @entity35 , a @entity86 or one of the other e-readers on the market			1
these online retail opportunities echo a debate that heated up in the late 1990s with the dawn of micropayments			0
" nobody would have believed we would pay to download music the way we do now , " @entity26 said			0
the idea that people might be willing to spend a dollar or so for little bits of digital content @entity101 is exactly the model @entity22 is based on -- and it 's part of why the @entity8 was being hyped as revolutionary before it even launched			1
" i think [ @entity109 ] will be remembered as the digital @entity110 , " said @entity105 , a writer at @entity107 newspaper in @entity108			0
" it could be a way out of this [ publishing ] crisis			0
" newspapers and magazine publishers have suffered financially in recent years as readers have migrated to the @entity118 and the growth of online advertising has failed to make up for the loss of print ad revenue			1
@entity124 , a columnist at @entity125 , wrote in december that regardless of its technical capabilities , @entity9 's tablet may falter like past attempts to revive print media			1
he cited fizzled attempts to introduce magazines on cd - rom discs			0
in his column , @entity124 quotes @entity134 , a journalism professor at @entity135 , to illustrate why the @entity8 is n't necessarily the golden answer to old media 's problems			1
ultimately , @entity124 says , it 's about what the consumer wants ­ -- and the @entity8 answers a problem consumers do n't have			1
" most people need a simple surfboard , rather than the complex -- and costly -- diving gear , " @entity134 told @entity124			0
one tech writer at @entity9 's @entity8 unveiling wednesday worried that because the @entity8 also functions like a computer , reading on the device may be difficult			1
" i 'm not sure how i feel about being on the @entity8 and reading , because then i 'm too connected , " said @entity151 , a senior writer at the tech site @entity153 , who believes her thoughts might be disrupted by the constant pings of e-mail			2
still , publishers are experimenting with versions of their magazines for e-readers and for smartphones			2
and , like @entity162 -- which publishes such magazines as @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , see infinite possibilities for success with the @entity8			1
@entity54 noted the launch of @entity171 's @entity41 app was widely successful in showing @entity162 that consumers have a desire to read magazines on electronic devices			2
and @entity166 is the most popular magazine download on the @entity35 , she said			0
but the @entity8 has a key advantage over the @entity35 , she said : the potential to bring in revenue from ads displayed on its magazine - style layouts			2
said @entity54 , " there¹s no advertising opportunities within the @entity35			0
" newspapers also got a hint of what the @entity8 might do for them during wednesday 's demo of a @entity191 application for the @entity8			1
the app seemed to merge old and new media by mirroring the @entity191 ' page layouts while allowing for interactive content within a story			2
" we are pleased to be part of the launch of this exciting new product and we look forward to further discussions with @entity9 , " said @entity197 , president of the @entity198 and @entity199 , senior vice president of digital operations , in a joint statement			2
" it 's too soon to discuss details of an application , but we are , as always , looking at innovative new platforms			0
" but with no content pricing announced wednesday , and no models regarding subscriptions for magazine and newspapers , many observers are still left to wonder how it will all work			2
@entity54 said @entity162 plans to try out several business models to see what works best			0
for example , the company must decide when selling ads whether to bundle advertising for the @entity8 with ads for print publications			1
@entity162 also must figure out how to market the @entity8 's digital versions of its magazines , she said			1
if everything works out , @entity54 hopes that consumers sitting in an airport will be able to touch a few buttons and download a virtual stack of @entity162 magazines for their flight			0
" i 'm thinking about people wondering , ' how long is my flight -- should i download an extra magazine ? ' " @entity26 said			0
" that 's a dynamic i 'm excited about			0
