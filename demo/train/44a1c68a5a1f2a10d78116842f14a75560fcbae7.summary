-- @entity1 will revert to using @entity3 engines in the 2012 and 2013 @entity5 seasons , restoring a partnership that led to the most successful era in the team 's history			1

" our previous relationship with @entity3 was one of the most successful in @entity1 ' history but we will not allow ourselves to dwell too much on the past			1
we must look to the future and continue to re-build our on - track reputation , which i am hopeful that today 's announcement will help us to do			0
" the partnership will include other marketing and business liaisons , and is expected to continue when the new turbo - charged energy - efficient @entity63 engines are introduced to @entity5 from 2014			0
" together we produced racing cars that are recognized for their technical innovation , and it is still @entity3 's most successful period in @entity5 to date , " @entity3 president @entity65 said			2
it means @entity3 will supply four of the sport 's 12 teams from next year , along with world champions @entity73 , @entity74 and the outfit it used to own , the renamed @entity3			0
. " it puts us ahead of other engine manufacturers in terms of market share , but off track it will also enable us to further use @entity5 as a marketing platform for our parent company , @entity3 , to try to bring a bit of this association to our fans and our customers worldwide , " @entity65 said			1
" @entity1 has recently taken several important steps , both commercially and technically , to update its operations and we feel that this partnership is another important step in its rigorous plan			2
" meanwhile , @entity93 announced a new deal with @entity95 on monday that is intended to boost the struggling team 's performance			1
the @entity11 - based @entity99 outfit , which is yet to earn a point in 2011 , will have access to @entity95 's @entity103 arm -- including facilities such as the team 's wind tunnel , driver simulators and race strategy tools			1
chief executive @entity109 said the team had also bought out the @entity37 business of its former technical partner @entity113 , which was owned by ex-director @entity114			0
" when we undertook our detailed review of the team in the first half of 2011 , it was clear that our bold ambitions for the future would need to be matched with some equally bold steps towards achieving them , " @entity109 told the @entity93 website			2
" i am delighted that in a relatively short space of time we are now in the fantastic position of being able to make these two very important announcements , which will enable us to make some dramatic strides forward with immediate effect			0
" @entity95 is one of the most prestigious and successful marques in @entity5 racing history , with an enviable record of success over many years			2
we can benefit enormously from @entity95 's far - reaching techniques and capabilities and i have no doubt that this partnership will see us take the technical steps necessary to make a significant leap forwards			0
