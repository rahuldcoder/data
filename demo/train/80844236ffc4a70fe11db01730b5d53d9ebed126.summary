no , @entity1 , you 're not a loser			1
but some people think you should have been			0
in sunday night 's biggest surprise , @entity1 's downbeat " @entity13 " nabbed the @entity7 for album of the year -- eclipsing darling - of - the - moment @entity9 , who collected four @entity7 , and pop queen @entity10 , whose latest , self - titled album was a critical and commercial smash			1
the announcement , by presenter @entity14 , seemed to stun the audience and even @entity1 himself			1
@entity17 briefly crashed the stage in what appeared to be mock protest but then said @entity1 " should 've given his award to @entity10			1
" @entity1 later said he expected @entity10 to win			1
on social media , some younger people were even wondering aloud : um , who is @entity1 ? here 's why the scruffy singer - songwriter 's upset win was so surprising -- and why it was n't : @entity1 's record did n't make a big splash released in february 2014 , " @entity13 " got strong reviews but quickly sank off the charts			1
none of its singles got mainstream radio play			0
@entity37 ranked it as the 60th top - selling album of the year -- behind @entity41 's christmas album			2
while critics praised the record 's melancholy beauty , some saw it as a sequel of sorts to his 2002 album " @entity50 " and not a groundbreaking artistic statement			0
but all the @entity7 love -- " @entity13 " also won best rock album -- has sparked renewed interest in an artist many may have forgotten			1
according to @entity57 , streams of @entity1 's music have increased 388 % since the @entity7			1
he has n't been a commercial force for two decades " i 'm a loser , baby , so why do n't you kill me ... " remember that song ? no ? " loser " came out in 1994 , when @entity10 was 12 years old and @entity9 was still in diapers			1
the song hit the top 10 in the @entity66 and was followed in 1996 by a popular album , " @entity70 , " and such modest hits such as " @entity69			0
" grammys 2015 : highs and lows critics and alternative - music fans have long admired @entity1 's talents -- he can play almost any musical instrument -- and his innovative blends of folk , rock , blues , hip - hop and psychedelia			2
but his cultural relevance seemed to be fading by the late ' 90s			0
" the most complete album of the bunch is ' @entity13 , ' " wrote @entity86 music critic @entity85 in making his grammy predictions before the ceremony , " yet it feels 10 to 15 years too late to hand this trophy to @entity1			1
" @entity10 is a global icon in her prime the most - nominated woman in @entity7 history , @entity10 is much more than a photogenic pop icon with strong pipes and a famous husband			1
released without warning in december 2013 , " @entity10 " was a bold , personal statement about love , sex and the challenges of a monogamous relationship			2
it was the no. 2 top - selling record of the year and drew widespread critical acclaim for its dark , intimate themes and accompanying videos			0
on @entity112 , it has a higher aggregrate rating than @entity1 's record			2
the @entity7 often reward strong album sales , and most prognosticators thought @entity10 was overdue to claim her first album - of - the - year prize			1
a win by @entity9 in this category would not have been a surprise , either			0
but ... the @entity7 have a history of surprises the @entity124 , who vote on the @entity7 , are an unpredictable bunch			2
the academy declines to release a breakdown of its 13,000 voter - eligible members by age , race or gender			0
but like the group that votes on the @entity134 , the @entity124 is seen by some critics as being old and out of touch with edgier contemporary music , especially when it comes to rap and hip hop			0
grammys 2015 : the winners list in 2005 , they snubbed @entity17 's " @entity144 " and @entity146 's " @entity145 " and handed album of the year to " @entity148 , " a collection of duets between blues legend @entity151 and other singers			2
it was a sentimental choice ; @entity151 had died the previous year			0
three years later , they overlooked @entity17 again , awarding the top - album prize to aging jazz - pop pioneer @entity156 over @entity17 's " graduation " and @entity160 's " back to @entity159			0
" so in that context , a @entity7 for @entity1 , 44 , over @entity10 , 33 , and @entity9 , 22 , is n't a total shock			1
why @entity1 won so how did @entity1 win ? as @entity165 's @entity164 has noted , it 's probably because his competition split the vote			0
a fan of pop , soul and r&b could have voted for @entity10 or @entity9 or @entity172 or even @entity173			0
but @entity1 's was the only rock record ( it 's more folk - rock , really ) in the category , giving him a potential edge among the academy 's bloc of voters who grew up on , say , @entity182 .			0

@entity1 upsets @entity10 to claim the @entity7 for best album of the year
his " @entity13 " was respected but not a commercial smash
on social media , younger people were even wondering : who is @entity1 ?
