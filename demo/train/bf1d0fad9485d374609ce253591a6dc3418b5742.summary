@entity1 's father was more abusive and violent than the president was aware of , according to his half - brother , who has written a memoir about their father			1
@entity7 , who is several years younger than the president , described their father as a brilliant man			1
but he was also an alcoholic , a " social failure " and an abusive husband , he said			0
" i remember the sounds of my mothers ' screams and i remember the sounds of breaking , things breaking , " he told @entity13			1
" and i remember that i could n't protect her			0
that 's something that no child ever forgets			0
" he said he especially remembered a violent episode when he was 6 or 7			0
" my father actually broke -- came in the door , against the restraining order , and held a knife to my mother 's throat , " he said			1
@entity1 apparently met their father once because his parents got divorced soon after he was born			1
@entity7 and the president have the same father , but @entity1 's mother was the second wife while @entity7 's mother was his third wife			1
unlike @entity1 , @entity7 grew up with his father			1
the president is lucky he never lived with his father , according to @entity38 , author of " @entity1 : the story			1
" " it would have been a much more difficult upbringing , " he said			0
divergent views of family history have caused some strain among @entity1 relatives , according to @entity7			1
" @entity1 i do n't think accepts -- or at least does not want to know -- the details of the beatings that occurred in our family , " he said			1
" i love my brother			0
he 's a great president			2
sometimes he 's a lousy brother			0
" the @entity51 did not respond to e-mails and phone calls thursday about the president 's half - brother 's book			1
but in a 2009 interview with @entity13 , the president said he was not blind to the flaws of his father			2
" it 's no secret that my father was a troubled person			2
anybody who has read my first book , " @entity68 , " knows that , you know , he had an alcoholism problem , that he did n't treat his families very well , " he said			0
" obviously it 's a sad part of my history and my background			0
but it 's not something that i spend a lot of time brooding over			0
" @entity7 and @entity1 have several things in common : similar good looks , biracial ethnicity , the same father and each had an @entity81 mother			1
despite their similarities , this is not the first time the two have been at odds			0
when they first met in @entity89 in the 1980s , @entity7 was growing up there and trying to connect with his @entity81 roots , he said			1
at the time , @entity1 came from @entity81 and was " really looking for that @entity92 side of him , and was trying to find more about himself and his identity			2
but i also felt that there was a rejection of a lot of western culture , " @entity7 said			2
" i felt that my brother -- at that time - felt that i was too white , " he said			0
" and i thought he was too black			0
" when they first met , @entity7 said , his half - brother came on strong			1
" that imposing voice , and also that commanding presence -- he was almost like a barracuda with his questions , " @entity7 said			2
but even if their diverging views of the @entity1 family 's history sometimes put the two siblings at odds , @entity7 said there were also things he was grateful for			1
his brother 's example , he said , helped him re-embrace the @entity1 name that he had long shunned			1
and some years ago , when they met after 20 years of separation , they shared some good times			0
" we laughed , and we hugged , and that was one of the most wonderful moments of my life			0
and @entity1 made it possible , " he said			2
@entity7 , who lives near @entity129 , hopes to raise awareness of domestic violence when the book is published in february			2
some of the proceeds , he said , will go to his foundation for disadvantaged children .			0
