-- who 'd be a referee ? when the crowd are n't getting on your back you 've got the players acting up or giving you an earful			0
so if someone described your refereeing as " the best , " you could be forgiven for feeling a small surge of pride			0
but when the person praising you has been called the world 's most notorious match fixer , then it 's time to show yourself a red card			1
@entity16 says he corrupted many football players and officials during a long criminal career , but there is one person who stands out from the crowd			2
his name was @entity24 , a referee from @entity25			1
" he was the best , he was the best , but not from @entity29 's point of view , " @entity16 told @entity0 during a wide - ranging television interview about his match - fixing days			1
perfect partner the @entity31 , who is now helping @entity34 police with match - fixing investigations , claims to have rigged the results of up to 100 matches over a 20 - year period , boasting of a 70 - 80 % success rate			2
@entity24 , who he describes as " very bold , " became one of his favourite match officials			1
according to @entity16 , the referee 's first match fix was an international friendly between @entity46 and @entity47 in may 2010 -- one of several warm - up matches played ahead of the @entity50 which the @entity51 hosted			1
watching highlights of the game on @entity54 , @entity16 gives a running commentary on the major incidents			2
" it 's crazy , " @entity16 says as @entity59 awards @entity46 a penalty kick			2
the quality of the footage is poor , but the fixer knows what happened			0
" this is not a penalty			0
the offence took place outside the box , " he says			0
the man from @entity25 is allegedly at it again in the second half , this time awarding @entity47 a penalty for a handball			1
replays show the ball striking a @entity80 player 's chest			0
@entity24 awarded three penalties in all during the match and , according to @entity16 , fulfilled his task of overseeing a high - scoring fixture			1
the game finished 5 - 0 to @entity46			0
" we paid him very good money , " @entity16 says			2
elaborate scheme @entity16 says getting @entity24 onto the pitch was the result of an elaborate scheme where the match - fixer used his now - defunct company ' @entity94 ' to target the @entity95 ( @entity95 )			1
" i had this idea to influence the warm - up games without the knowledge of the association concerned			1
" so i remember writing a formal letter to the association requesting that my company ' football 4 @entity104 ' supply referees from @entity46 at our expense , " @entity16 explains			1
supplying referees in this way is a breach of @entity29 rules , but @entity16 's idea was accepted			1
" it is clear that the convicted criminal and football match - fixer , @entity16 , was involved in convincing @entity95 to agree to a company then managed by him [ @entity117 ] to select , fund and appoint referees , " said a @entity29 statement in march 2012			1
@entity29 also had act over a mini tournament in @entity122 , @entity123 in february 2011			1
fixers at an @entity126 - based syndicate approached the @entity127 of @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 inviting them to an all - expenses paid event			1
but they were all duped , because the referees had allegedly been paid to fix the results			0
@entity136 , a @entity29 investigator between 2010 and 2012 , recalls the set up			1
" it involved four international teams and an empty stadium , no ticket sales and yet the game was ( open ) for betting , " @entity136 explains			0
" i sat and watched match fixers with a briefcase full of cash to pay the referees			1
" seven goals were scored in the two matches played -- all of them from the penalty spot			0
" i think that 's the most shocking for me to see a fixing syndicate in total control of two international friendlies , played in the same stadium to no crowd at all			0
it 's eerie , absolutely eerie , " @entity136 said			0
@entity29 handed down life bans for the six match officials who @entity16 says were targeted by his former associates in @entity31			1
paying the penalty @entity16 insists he was n't involved in the @entity123 scandal -- one of the most notorious and brazen match fixes of recent times -- but his fingerprints were clearly all over the warm - up matches in @entity46			1
a @entity29 report , seen by @entity0 , concluded that the match involving @entity24 was " manipulated for betting fraud purposes " and noted that " several @entity95 members were either easily duped or extremely foolish " when organizing the games			1
@entity24 continued officiating into 2011 , notably taking charge of an international friendly match between @entity176 and @entity177 in @entity178 in june that year			1
@entity176 played a match against a second - string @entity177 side -- a surprising detail in itself , but what caught the eye was how the match ended			2
when 90 minutes of regulation play was over , @entity176 was leading 4 - 0			0
four or five minutes were due to be added for injury time , but the score remained the same			0
@entity24 kept the match going			1
in the 98th minute he awarded a penalty to @entity177 for a handball that replays show never happened			0
@entity177 converted the penalty and the match ended 4 - 1			2
analysis of betting patterns by @entity29 revealed a surge in bets for a fifth goal to be scored			2
@entity24 , who retired from refereeing before @entity29 could take disciplinary action , denies fixing matches , but is n't saying much more			1
when contacted by @entity0 , the former referee said : " i have put an end to my career and everything is finished			0
" he added : " what is past is past			0
" for what it 's worth , @entity16 thinks referees should be paid more			2
" they get about $ 1,000 or maybe $ 1,500 ( per game ) which is very small money			0
in my opinion , @entity29 should pay them a lot more or they should start to professionalize this officiating			2
" when asked about the payment of referees , @entity29 told @entity0 : " corruption does not depend on how much you are paid , but instead , and above all , honesty and values of the individual			2
" @entity136 says the time may have come to protect referees from the fixers			2
" when you 're on your own it 's very difficult to turn down two or three guys that are pressuring you , " he says			0
" it 's the easiest thing in the world to write a manual and say this is how you should react			0
in the real world , it 's a difficult thing in isolation to do for a referee			0
so they 're vulnerable and i feel they 'd need more protection			0
