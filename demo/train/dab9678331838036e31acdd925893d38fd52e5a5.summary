-- nobody 's perfect -- in life or the 2014 @entity4 basketball brackets			1
but @entity5 gave it quite a ride , notching 36 correct men 's tournament picks until he was derailed saturday night			1
@entity5 , 23 , of @entity10 , picked the wrong team to win the @entity14 - @entity13 game , killing his chance of a perfect 63 - 0 bracket in the @entity19 ' @entity18 pool			1
@entity5 had picked every single game in the round of 64 and the first four games played saturday			2
then , @entity13 upset @entity14 , 55 - 53			2
@entity5 had picked the @entity23			2
the pool is for bragging rights and has no prize money , unlike other bracket pools			0
@entity5 forgot to enter the @entity28 , also run through @entity19 sports			2
he tweeted saturday , " and that was the closest i 've ever come to not winning a billion dollars			0
" additionally , there were no perfect brackets remaining in @entity34 's bracket challenge			1
@entity35 , which runs one of the bigger bracket challenges , previously reported that in the past two years the last remaining perfect brackets were eliminated in the 22nd and 23rd games of the tournament			2
@entity34 reports that of the roughly 30 million entrants it has had over the 13 years , no one has come close to a perfect bracket , and that only one person has had a perfect first round in the last seven years			1
@entity5 told @entity34 on saturday he was in a rush when he was getting ready to leave for work when he filled out his @entity4 tournament bracket online			1
although he had entered his bracket on the @entity19 website -- he did his picks in less than five minutes -- @entity5 forgot to enter the @entity28			1
@entity53 is one of the sponsors			0
@entity56 and co-sponsor @entity19 have an insurance policy sold to them by @entity60 's @entity59 , which would cover the cost of any prize money			0
the companies did not disclose how many people entered the challenge			0
@entity5 said that " never in a million years " did he think he would be in this position			0
" i was about to leave for work , and i was in a rush , " @entity5 said			0
" i filled it out , and that was kind of it			0
i did n't even really think about it			0
however , if i can reach out to mr. @entity60 , if he would consider grandfathering me in to be eligible and if he can make an exception , that would mean a lot to me and give everyone , i guess , a perfect bracket to root for			1
" going into the tournament , winning @entity60 's billion was the ultimate longshot -- 9.2 quintillion - to - 1 , by some estimates			1
see how @entity0 anchors are doing in the @entity83 more on @entity84 for @entity84 fans , vasectomy timing is everything @entity89 's @entity88 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity94 man 's bid for perfect bracket ends when @entity13 wins
new : @entity5 did n't sign up for bracket with big *jackpot*
no one is still in running for *$* 1 billion for perfect @entity4 bracket
