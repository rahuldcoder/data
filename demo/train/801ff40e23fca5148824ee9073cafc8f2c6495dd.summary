-- @entity1 beat heroic 14 - man @entity3 9 - 8 in @entity4 saturday to reach the final of the @entity6			1
the match was overshadowed by the 18th minute dismissal of @entity3 captain @entity9 for a dangerous tackle			1
it looked to be a harsh decision by @entity14 referee @entity13 and tipped the match in @entity1 's favor although they had to withstand a late @entity18 onslaught to maintain their slender lead			2
@entity3 had led 3 - 0 through a @entity22 penalty before losing their skipper , but a pair of @entity26 penalties put @entity1 6 - 3 ahead at the interval			1
he increased that lead to 9 - 3 with his third penalty early in the second half only for @entity3 to hit back through a clever solo try by scrum half @entity33			1
@entity35 , a second half replacement for @entity22 , missed the conversion as it hit the post before @entity3 had a second chance to take the lead in the closing moments			2
fortunate to win a penalty on the halfway line , @entity43 's kick was accurate but dipped just under the posts			0
@entity3 spent the remainder of the match with the bulk of possession but were unable to work an opening to leave the @entity52 to contemplate a final against either hosts @entity55 or @entity56 who play the second semifinal sunday on the same ground			1
but at the end , the main talking point was the crucial red card for @entity9 , whose tackle on @entity63 lifted the @entity52 wing off his feet as he released a pass			2
blog : why @entity55 must win the @entity6 @entity13 believed the infringement merited dismissal rather than a sin - bin offense or warning but former @entity6 winning captain @entity71 of @entity72 thought otherwise			1
" it was a dangerous tackle , yes			1
never a red card , " he told @entity74			0
" it killed the game , " he added			0
@entity9 , who could miss next friday 's third place playoff match , was also amazed to have been sent off			0
there was no malicious intent			0
i thought it was a normal tackle , the next thing i was walking off into the stands			0
" wales have made only one previous appearance in the @entity6 semifinals , losing 49 - 6 to @entity55 in @entity87 in 1987 , but also had a man , @entity88 , sent off in the defeat			1
@entity52 coach @entity90 praised the " amazingly brave " @entity3 , but believed @entity13 , the 2007 @entity6 final referee , had little choice but to dismiss @entity9			1
" i do n't care at all whether it was a good match or not , whether the @entity18 deserve to be in the final , we have qualified for the final and that 's all that counts			0
" interest in the opening semifinal was intense and 60,000 fans crammed into the @entity100 in @entity101 to watch their @entity18 heroes on giant big screens			0
they trailed away disappointed , but the intensity is set to step up a gear for the clash between @entity108 rivals @entity55 and @entity56 at @entity109			2
all @entity111 coach @entity110 believes the match his side 's " biggest in 10 years " as they bid to win the @entity6 for only the second time after a series of near misses			0
@entity56 have improved after an opening pool defeat to @entity117 , but will be without full - back @entity118 , who has lost his race to be fit for the last four clash .			0
