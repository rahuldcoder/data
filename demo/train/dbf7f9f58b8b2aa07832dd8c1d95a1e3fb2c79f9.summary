@entity0 -- @entity2 , the world 's number three pc maker , reported thursday a 79 % profit plunge for the first quarter of the year -- to just $ 130 million -- owing to a slump in desktop and laptop sales , so - called " end - user computing " products			1
quarterly operating income for the division fell 65 % year on year			1
" in the pc industry , everyone is struggling -- not just @entity2 -- and especially in the mobile pc market , " says @entity14 , senior principal analyst at @entity16 - based @entity15			1
" when i look at those ( @entity2 ) revenues split between mobility and desktop , they 're really not too far out of line with where the industry is at			2
the entire pc market struggled in @entity27			0
" technology research firm @entity28 estimated 79 million pc shipments occurred in the first quarter of 2013 -- a fall of more than 11 % year on year			1
@entity32 saw a 24 % drop in pc shipments , @entity2 fell 11 % while @entity36 - based @entity35 fell nearly 30 %			1
the fall in global pc shipments contrasted with a rise in tablet volumes , according to @entity41 , an it market research firm			2
from january to march this year , @entity42 shipped nearly 20 million units to be the world 's number one tablet maker ; @entity46 shipped nearly 9 million units for second place			0
the world 's top five tablet computer companies shipped more than 49 million units to record 142 % growth year on year			0

@entity2 's quarterly operating income for the enterprise division soared 71 % to $ 79 million but contributed just 8 % of the company 's total income			2
" enterprise solutions are significant growth opportunities , " says @entity14			2
" the margins are certainly better than the @entity53 area -- high single digits to the low teens -- versus the enterprise space which is considerably higher			0
" in terms of hardware units sold for enterprise solutions , @entity32 has traditionally been number one , with @entity2 and @entity76 rounding out the top three , adds @entity14			1
still , the future seems anything but bright for the @entity53 industry despite a flurry of attempted innovations , from super-thin and light ultrabooks to convertible pcs that can morph into tablet forms			0
" @entity2 was a bit slow to the @entity92 game and lost to players like ( @entity36 's ) @entity94 and @entity35 , " says @entity87 , editor - in - chief of @entity89 @entity88			0
in addition , @entity2 's dive into convertible laptops " was rather half - hearted : poor screen , too bulky			0
" " you can kind of say the @entity53 industry is throwing darts at the board to see what sticks , " says @entity14			1
" if they can find that combination of a whole computing performance pc , with mobility and a low price point to compete with some of those $ 200 media tablets , then i think there 's opportunity			0
there 's still an opportunity for a pc refresh cycle			0
