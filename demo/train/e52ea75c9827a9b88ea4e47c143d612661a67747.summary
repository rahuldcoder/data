-- the head of an @entity3 - inspired militia fighting in @entity4 is giving a radical splinter group five days to end infighting and accept arbitration from @entity9 clerics or face expulsion from the region , according to an audio message posted online tuesday			1
@entity13 , the chief of @entity14 , called on the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) to stop turning its guns on its allies and return to the fold of @entity3 's central command			1
" i swear by @entity24 , if you again refuse @entity24 's judgment , and do not stop your plague and pushing your ignorant ideology on the @entity30 nation then you will be expelled , even from @entity31 , " @entity13 said in the more than eight - minute message produced by @entity14 's media wing @entity23			0
earlier this month , even top @entity3 leader @entity32 weighed in on the situation , and the group 's central leadership posted a notice online saying @entity15 " is not a branch of the @entity3 group			1
" the @entity14 and @entity15 are both fighting in @entity4			2
@entity14 and other @entity40 insurgents argue that the toppling of president @entity43 's government is the top priority , but @entity15 wants the formation of a radical @entity40 state to be the main goal			1
apparently , @entity15 also has been fighting against @entity14 members and against civilians who support the opposition			0
a conflict in @entity15 jurisprudence appears at the core of the long - standing dispute between the @entity31 - born extremist group and its former comrades in @entity3			2
" know that we have patiently waited for a whole year while you committed violations , made false accusations , and misconstrued the truth to justify your greater corruption			0
we relinquished many of our rights , " @entity13 said in the audio message			0
" you know that until now we have not turned away from the frontlines or fighting the regime as you have done			0
" the order comes just two days after a suicide bombing allegedly carried out by @entity15 killed a mediator representing @entity32 in northern @entity4			2
@entity72 's assassination dashed hopes for a political resolution to months of open warfare between @entity15 and rebel factions that has claimed the lives of at least 2,000 people , according to the @entity79 , and culminated in the expulsion of the renegade group from @entity3 's general command earlier this month			1
" @entity32 is clearly fed up with @entity15 's open rejection of his overall leadership of the @entity3 network			1
moreover , he is likely quite concerned about how @entity15 is alienating ordinary @entity4 by a brutal campaign that has involved the public beheading of opponents and the imposition of @entity92 - style rule on the population , including the banning of smoking , music and unveiled women in public , " @entity86 , a national security analyst for @entity0 , wrote earlier this month			0
the bad blood between the two groups started last april when @entity15 chief @entity101 announced his group 's expansion into @entity4 and claimed to absorb @entity14 into his ranks			1
tensions rose after @entity101 openly refused to heed @entity32 's directive to disband and leave @entity4			0
analysts say the factional fighting strengthens the government 's hand in the country 's nearly three - year civil war by distracting insurgents from engaging in combat with @entity4 troops and diverting resources and manpower to the war within a war .			0

radical @entity40 group in @entity4 is warned to accept arbitration or leave country
@entity15 wants to form an @entity40 state in @entity4
