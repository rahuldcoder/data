-- three weeks ago , @entity2 author @entity1 conjured an internet frenzy when she and @entity4 announced that a new adaptation of her book @entity9 , a popular supplement to her @entity2 series was in the works			1
the announcement revealed that the film will be set in the same wizarding world as @entity2 — but follow magizoologist @entity14 , a professor of magical creatures , and take place 70 years before @entity2 's journey began			1
@entity0 caught up with @entity18 , who produced all eight of the original @entity2 films , on the red carpet of his latest spectacle , @entity23 ( which reunited him with @entity25 director @entity24 ) , and asked him to dish about @entity9 — or " @entity9 " as he called it for short			1
@entity18 , who confirmed that he will be producing the film , said that @entity1 has n't turned in a finished script just yet , but that " @entity1 is at work " and tremendously excited about the project			1
" she 's not doing it for any other reason other than she loves the world and she had a story that she wanted to tell , " he said			2
" it 's incredibly exciting , " he continued			0
" she does n't have to go back to this world , but something pulled her back			2
this is not @entity2 , @entity41 , and @entity42			1
this is a separate story within a universe related to the @entity2 universe			1
" @entity0 : @entity1 and @entity4 announce new movie franchise set in wizarding world when asked about which creatures we might see in the film — you better believe i brought up quintapeds and lethifolds — @entity18 demured			1
" we follow @entity14 on his adventures , " he said , grinning			0
the producer said @entity1 has no shortage of plot ideas for @entity9 because she knows @entity14 's history so thoroughly — after all , she created him			1
" the fact that she 's going to this world means there are stories to tell , " he said			0
" when i was doing the @entity64 , what was clear to me is that @entity1 's knowledge of this world is infinite			2
what you read in the books was just the surface of her knowledge			0
she had notebook upon notebook of stuff			0
i would call her and say , ' what 's the sixth use of dragon 's blood ? ' and she 'd have it at her fingertips			0
" " in the fifth film , i think it was , we had the @entity88 family tree , " he recalled			2
" i called her , and literally 20 minutes later i receive this family tree , via fax in those days , with a hundred names and about six generations with birthdays , death dates , marriages , all figured out			0
" so let 's hope she 's weaving all that knowledge into another truly magical tale — or even ( dare we dream ? ) a whole series of them			0
