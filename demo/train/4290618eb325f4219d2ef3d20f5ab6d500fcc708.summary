-- president @entity1 is immensely popular overseas and his re-election will be welcomed by many			1
but how will his second - term agenda differ from the first ? and what will it mean for a global economy where growth in emerging markets is hesitant , and a massive sovereign debt crisis continues to brew in @entity12 ? read more : five things @entity1 must do one thing is certain			1
in the immediate aftermath of a grueling and divisive campaign , and confronted with a national emergency -- the fall off the " fiscal cliff " -- @entity1 's immediate priorities will be domestic , not international			2
drawing on the authority conveyed by electoral victory , he will seek to establish a constructive dialogue with republicans who continue to control the @entity25 and who can filibuster his agenda in the @entity28 , just as before			0
above all , he will seek to avoid large tax increases and expenditure cuts worth about 4 % of gdp that will be triggered automatically on january 1 next year , should he fail to reach agreement on a long - term plan of fiscal consolidation worth some $ 3.5 trillion to $ 4 trillion over 10 years			1

the task of keeping the eurozone afloat , amid scared investors and depression - level unemployment in @entity45 and @entity46 , will become even harder			0
the risk of a renewed global banking crisis triggered by sovereign defaults in @entity12 would escalate sharply			1
nor could the @entity37 or @entity12 deploy the policy arsenal they possessed in 2008 to right the ship -- their fiscal and monetary bullets have been spent			2
confronted with this dire alternative , @entity1 will have to compromise by accepting a program of long - term cuts in social programs while @entity24 accept phased tax increases -- both departing from their diametrically opposed electoral platforms			1
as a minimum , this compromise will include a claw back of the payroll tax reduction , and of extended unemployment benefits as well as some expenditure cuts , adding up to 1 % to 2 % of @entity67 in 2013			2
the likely effect will be that the recovery will remain sluggish , and the world 's growth locomotives will again have to be found , if anywhere , in @entity72 and other emerging markets			0
quest : which way will economy go ? the uncertainty surrounding the @entity37 fiscal outlook is likely to persist for several months and if , as is possible , the only feasible compromise turns out to be temporary , new fiscal cliffs may loom in the future , extending the uncertainty over years to come			1
this outcome is possible because the election outcome has not fundamentally altered the balance of forces			0
an obvious implication is that the @entity37 will remain fiscally bound as far as the eye can see			2
@entity12 will have to rely on their own resource to deal with their dangerous crisis , with the @entity37 urging action and support through @entity93 involvement , but without providing money for rescue programs either directly or indirectly through the @entity93			1

with the @entity12 and the @entity103 also retrenching , international organizations will increasingly look to @entity72 and other emerging markets for additional funds and new initiatives , buttressing the influence of the rising powers in their deliberations			0
perhaps fortified by weather events such as @entity111 , @entity1 's second term may bring renewed efforts to encourage control of carbon emissions through environmental regulation , which could yield some modest results			1
however , given the profound skepticism about climate change in many quarters , the array of special interests in favor of fossil fuels , and the simple fact that the median @entity37 family has seen its living standards decline over many years , the appetite for increased gasoline or other carbon taxes will be low			2
the new administration can be expected to pursue the development of shale natural gas ( a clean alternative to coal ) and reduced reliance on imported energy with alacrity			0
the positive effect on reduced gas prices in @entity12 and other regions of these new @entity37 technologies is already being felt			2
read more : fiscal cliff looms over campaign climax increased use of natural gas in lieu of other fuels , and the continued " dematerialization " of the @entity37 economy , will in any event help mitigate the nation 's emissions for a long time to come			1
one arena where the new term may bring more daring initiatives is trade			0
this is ground where the administration and the republicans in @entity162 may be able to join forces , perhaps as part of a broader bargain that would include tax reforms in support of business , and assistance for workers displaced by trade -- both of which @entity1 has also advocated			1
trade measures will likely include implementation of recently ratified trade agreements , determined pursuit of the @entity177 , and may include a renewed effort to close on a low - ambition and partial @entity180 deal			0
markets may breathe an immediate sigh of relief that the election did not end in a dead heat or require extensive recounts , or pitted @entity1 against a @entity24 senate			2
stocks in healthcare and in alternative energy may be boosted more durably by his re-election			0
but until the deadlock over how , and how quickly , to effect fiscal consolidation is broken for good , and @entity37 politics finds a way to address the nation 's structural challenges -- including exploding healthcare costs and its chronically low savings rate -- there is little reason to expect a trend shift in equity prices			0
for the time being , the @entity37 government continues to borrow at the most advantageous rates , in part for lack of better alternatives			0
everyone knows this can not last -- how long it will is anyone 's guess			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216			0

@entity216 says @entity1 will seek to avoid tax increases *scheduled* for january 2013
if the @entity37 falls into recession , the outlook for the world economy will darken , he says
the risk of a renewed global banking crisis would escalate sharply , he says
