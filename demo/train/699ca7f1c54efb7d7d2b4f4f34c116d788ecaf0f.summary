-- the @entity1 moved to increase embassy security around the world after the attack that killed the @entity1 ambassador to @entity6 and three staffers			1
" i have directed my administration to provide all necessary resources to support the security of our personnel in @entity6 , and to increase security at our diplomatic posts around the globe , " president @entity8 said in a statement issued wednesday morning in response to the attack			1
the @entity1 deployed a group of @entity21 called a @entity22 to @entity6 to help secure @entity1 facilities , two @entity1 officials said wednesday			1
such units are specially trained to retake or guard diplomatic installations and other @entity1 facilities in troubled regions			1
about 50 @entity21 were headed to @entity27 and could deploy elsewhere in @entity6 after their arrival , @entity1 officials said			1
six things to know about the attack other @entity1 troops and units abroad have been notified they could be ordered to move to embassy installations around the world to provide additional security , a senior @entity1 military official said			1
the official added that the @entity38 is involved in intensive discussions with the @entity40 and @entity41 on how to implement @entity8 's order to step up diplomatic security			2
" we are looking at the requirements , what we need and identifying what assets could have to move , " the official said , adding that could include troops , aircraft , ships and other equipment if needed			0
two @entity54 warships were moving toward the @entity6 coast wednesday , two @entity1 officials said			1
both are equipped with @entity59 missiles that could be used if a strike was ordered , which " will give the administration flexibility " if action is ordered against targets in the country , a senior official said			0
the moves come a day after the attack that killed ambassador @entity67 amid protests at the @entity1 @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity6			1
heavily armed protesters assaulted the consulate , said secretary of state @entity73			0
demonstrators also attacked the @entity75 in @entity76 on tuesday			0
protesters in both countries were apparently angry about an online film considered offensive to @entity80			0
on wednesday , the @entity40 urged @entity1 to avoid the area around the embassy in @entity83 , @entity84 , due to " anti- @entity1 protests outside			2
" there was no immediate word of violence			0
" there 's a lot of skittish people at the @entity40 right now , " @entity0 foreign affairs reporter @entity89 said			0
protesters attack @entity1 diplomatic compounds in @entity95 , @entity6 it is unclear whether @entity67 ' death resulted from the broader anti-american protests or a separate , local plot against the ambassador , former @entity40 official @entity96 said			1
" until you are able to answer that question , it 's kind of hard to assign the significance of this , " said @entity96 , who was @entity40 spokesman during president @entity103 's administration			0
@entity109 , head of @entity6 's ruling party , told reporters wednesday that " the transitional government has done all that it could in order to protect the embassies , the consulates and the foreign companies in @entity6			1
" secretary of state @entity103 said she had spoken to the @entity6 president seeking additional protection for @entity1 interests in the country			1
she said the @entity1 government is also working with countries to " protect our personnel , our missions and @entity1 citizens worldwide			2
" 4 hours or fire and chaos " there is no higher priority than protecting our men and women , wherever they serve , " @entity103 said			0
@entity6 prime minister @entity134 said the government would increase security wednesday in response to the attacks			1
security outside embassies is the responsibility of the host country , and it 's " entirely possible " that @entity1 officials asked for but did n't receive help to push back the attackers that ultimately killed @entity67 and the other staffers , said @entity148 , a @entity149 analyst and former @entity40 counterterrorism agent			1
" the question will be , once the dominoes fell in @entity76 and protests started to occur , what was requested and what was done , " he said			0
no @entity1 @entity21 were guarding the consulate at the time of the attack , according to @entity1 officials			1
but that is not necessarily unusual , @entity148 said			0
" having the @entity21 can be viewed as politically sensitive at times , " @entity148 said			2
it can also raise the profile of an installation and invite unwanted attention or attacks , he said			0
@entity166 : @entity6 has been suffering ' fragile security ' diplomats in unstable regions typically travel in convoys of heavily armed guards , and it 's likely that @entity67 was well - guarded , said @entity173 , former @entity1 ambassador to @entity174			1
" i can assure you , i can absolutely assure you , that security was paramount on the minds of the embassy and the ambassador , " @entity173 said			2
but he said it 's just not possible to surround diplomats in a bubble of impenetrable protection			0
" it 's never a matter of getting rid of risk			2
it 's a matter of managing risk , and that is a very tough thing to do , " he said			2
@entity67 ' death , however , will spark a thorough review of security practices and could result in changes to how diplomats are protected , @entity148 said			0
something similar happened after the 1983 bombing of the @entity75 in @entity197 , @entity198 , sparked new construction and security standards for embassies , @entity148 said			0
" my gut tells me that this will cause that to happen , " he said			0
