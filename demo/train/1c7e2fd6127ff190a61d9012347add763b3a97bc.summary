-- a shopper in @entity2 may have gotten more than she bargained for when she reportedly discovered a chilling note stuffed in a pair of pants she purchased from @entity7 retailer , @entity6			1
scrawled on a yellow piece of paper and wrapped around what appears to be a prison identification card , was a message claiming to be from an inmate at a @entity15 prison making clothes for export under conditions of slave labor			1
" we work 15 hours every day and eat food that would n't even be fed to pigs and dogs			0
we 're ( forced to ) work like oxen , " the handwritten note said in @entity15			1
the message appealed to the international community to " condemn these human rights abuses by the @entity15 government			2
" tip of the iceberg ? @entity33 , who lives in @entity2 's @entity34 , said she bought the pants for about Â £ 10 ( $ 16 ) on a trip to @entity37 in 2011 , but left the garment in her closet -- unworn -- after she discovered the zipper was broken			2
she only found the note when she retrieved the item while packing for a holiday last week , she said			0
after getting a rough translation of the note , @entity44 sought help from @entity48 , an organization that has documented the use of forced labor in @entity15 detention facilities in the past			1
" i was shocked to find this note and card inside the trousers from @entity6 and even more shocked to discover that it appears to have been made under slave labor conditions in a @entity15 prison , " she told @entity48			1
" i am only sorry that i did not discover the note when i first purchased the clothing -- then i could have brought this scandal to light much earlier			0
" @entity48 's @entity2 program director , @entity63 , described the story as " horrific			1
" " it 's very difficult to know whether it 's genuine , but the fear has to be that this is just the tip of the iceberg , " @entity63 said			0
investigation underway @entity6 denied sourcing clothing made using forced labor in a statement wednesday , noting the " considerable time delay " since the garment was purchased			1
a spokesperson for the company said that particular line of pants was last sold in @entity2 in october 2009			2
" we find it very strange that this ... has come to light so recently , given that the trousers were on sale four years ago , " he said			0
since 2009 , the company 's ethical standards team has carried out nine inspections of the supplier who made the garment , and found no prison or forced labor of any kind , the statement said			2
despite the company 's suspicions , the spokesperson said @entity6 " knows its responsibilities to the workers in its supply chain , " and has started a detailed investigation			2
the company is also examining two other cases that have surfaced in @entity105 in recent days			1
on two separate occasions , women reportedly found desperate pleas sewn into labels on dresses purchased from the same @entity6 store in @entity112			0
one read " forced to work exhausting hours , " while the other said , " @entity115 sweatshop conditions			0
" @entity6 said the circumstances surrounding the incidents were suspicious , since the labels looked very similar and the two garments were on sale around the same time , but they were made in two different countries , " many thousands of miles apart			1
" the budget retailer was among a group of international brands that sourced from factories in @entity129 's @entity128 building , which collapsed in april 2013 , killing more than 1,000 workers and injuring 2,500 others			0
the company said it has paid over $ 12 million in aid and compensation to to support the victims of the disaster			0
forced labor in @entity15 it 's not the first time western consumers have found distressing notes allegedly from abused workers in detention in @entity15			1
in 2011 , a woman in the @entity145 found a letter in a mix of broken @entity148 and @entity15 inside a @entity150 decoration purportedly from a inmate who made the object under abusive conditions			2
last year , @entity0 tracked down a @entity15 man who claimed he wrote the note , along with more than a dozen others , while at a labor camp in northeastern @entity15			1
@entity158 , the company that owned the store that sold the item , said it found " no evidence " that production was subcontracted to a labor camp during its investigation into the case , but added it no longer sourced from that supplier			0
until recently , @entity15 used hundreds of labor camps to detain petty offenders without a trial , under what was known as the laojiao -- or " re-education through labor " -- scheme			1
the system was criticized by human rights groups as a means to silence so - called trouble makers , including political dissidents , activists and @entity182 members			0
in november last year , @entity183 said it would begin to close the camps			0
but @entity48 has since warned that while the laojiao camps have been shut , research suggests that authorities have expanded the use of other forms of arbitrary detention such as " black jails , " enforced drug rehabilitation clinics and " brainwashing centers " to take their place			2
@entity0 could not reach the @entity196 prison in @entity15 's @entity198 province , where the note found in @entity2 allegedly came from			1
the facility houses around 5,000 inmates , according to @entity15 's justice ministry			0
@entity0 's @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
