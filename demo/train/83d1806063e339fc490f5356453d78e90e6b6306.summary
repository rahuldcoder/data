@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday agreed to move his scheduled special address to a joint session of @entity5 back one day -- from september 7 to september 8 -- after consultations with @entity8 speaker @entity7 , the @entity8 said wednesday night			1
" today , the president asked to address the @entity5 about the need for urgent action on the economic situation facing the @entity14 people as soon as @entity5 returned from recess , " the @entity8 said in a statement wednesday night			1
" both houses will be back in session after their august recess on wednesday , september 7th , so that was the date that was requested			2
we consulted with the speaker about that date before the letter was released , but he determined thursday would work better			0
the president is focused on the urgent need to create jobs and grow our economy , so he welcomes the opportunity to address a @entity28 on thursday , september 8th and challenge our nation 's leaders to start focusing 100 % of their attention on doing whatever they can to help the @entity14 people			1
" a political showdown had erupted earlier wednesday over @entity2 's sudden request			1
@entity7 , in a letter to @entity2 , said the 8 p.m. speech would come less than two hours after the @entity8 is scheduled to complete legislative business , and the speaker recommended moving it back a day			1
@entity7 's letter noted that security sweeps of the chamber usually take more than three hours			0
" there are considerations about the congressional calendar that must be made prior to scheduling such an extraordinary event , " @entity7 wrote			0
" with the significant amount of time -- typically more than three hours -- that is required to allow for a security sweep of the @entity8 chamber before receiving a president , it is my recommendation that your address be held on the following evening , when we can ensure there will be no parliamentary or logistical impediments that might detract from your remarks			2
" one senior @entity59 aide told @entity1 that " arranging a joint session of @entity5 is n't as simple as snapping our fingers			0
" @entity2 's requested date conflicted with a @entity59 presidential debate to be held at the @entity64 in @entity65			1
when asked about that conflict , @entity8 press secretary @entity66 brushed it off			2
" this is the right time to do it ( and ) the right day to do it , " @entity66 said in reference to @entity2 's speech			1
if the @entity59 want to " adjust the timing of their debate ... that would be completely fine with us			0
" numerous observers noted that the september speech will conflict with the opening game of the @entity82 's regular season			1
the dispute had touched off accusations by people on each side -- all on condition of not identifying who made them -- of high - handed behavior by the other , as well as the @entity8			2
one @entity92 source said the @entity8 provided little advance notice of the speech request to congressional @entity92 , while the @entity59 aide stressed that @entity59 were not consulted at all			1
the aide added that republicans were notified only 15 minutes before the public release of @entity2 's request			1
events like the president 's @entity105 typically involve as much as four to six weeks of lead time and consultation , involving a series of meetings among police , @entity102 officials and others , the @entity59 aide noted			0
however , a @entity8 official said @entity7 's office was consulted and raised no objection			1
that prompted @entity7 spokesman @entity116 to insist that " no one in the speaker 's office -- not the speaker , not any staff -- signed off on the date the @entity8 announced today			1
" " unfortunately , we were n't even asked if that date worked for the @entity8 , " @entity116 said			2
" shortly before it arrived this morning , we were simply informed that a letter was coming			0
it 's unfortunate the @entity8 ignored decades -- if not centuries -- of the protocol of working out a mutually agreeable date and time before making any public announcement			2
" a senior @entity92 aide familiar with scheduling such events in previous administrations said " the childish behavior coming out of the speaker 's office today is truly historic			2
" " it is unprecedented to reject the date that a president wants to address a joint session of the @entity5 , " the senior @entity92 aide said			0
" people die and state funerals are held with less fuss , so the logistics excuse by the speaker 's office is laughable			0
yes , consultation always occurs , but the president always gets the date he wants			0
" meanwhile , an aide to @entity8 minority leader @entity149 said @entity7 did n't consult with @entity8 @entity92 leaders about seeking a new date for @entity2 's speech			1
@entity2 's request for a wednesday evening speech was accepted by the leadership of the @entity92 - controlled @entity156 , according to a @entity92 @entity156 leadership aide			1
the approval of leaders from both chambers of @entity5 , however , is required for such a presidential request to be accepted			0
@entity2 's speech is intended to provide a prime - time platform for the rollout of his highly anticipated job growth plan			1
" our nation faces unprecedented economic challenges , and millions of hard - working @entity14 continue to look for jobs , " @entity2 said in a letter sent earlier wednesday to @entity7 and @entity156 majority leader @entity166 , @entity167			0
" as i have traveled across our country this summer and spoken with our fellow @entity14 , i have heard a consistent message : @entity0 needs to put aside politics and start making decisions based on what is best for our country and not what is best for each of our parties in order to grow the economy and create jobs			0
we must answer this call			0
" the national unemployment rate currently stands at 9.1 % -- a figure all but ensuring that the state of the fragile economy will remain the dominant issue of the 2012 presidential campaign			0
@entity1 's @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
