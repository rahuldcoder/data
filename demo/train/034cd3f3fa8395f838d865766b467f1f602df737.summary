' an ' icon for an icon			2
' given @entity7 is listed by @entity8 as the world 's most valuable sports team , perhaps it 's understandable there is a tinge of hyperbole in the marketing of the redevelopment of @entity7 's home -- the @entity17 " we were inspired by medieval cathedrals , with all their sculptures and paintings around the building telling their stories , " @entity18 , who heads up the @entity20 architectural firm @entity19 that designed the new arena , told @entity0			1
when its proposed refurbishment ends in around six years ' time , the @entity28 -- where @entity7 beat great rivals @entity29 on saturday -- will be wrapped in a skin of leds and ' polished mirror			1
' housing a retail area , restaurants and hotel among the attractions under its metallic membrane , the multipurpose arena will transform a stadium where construction began 70 years ago today			1
its new exterior will also be able to beam out the most famous moments of the 10 - time @entity46 champions upon completion , although that date is still uncertain due to legal wrangles			1
" for this ' holy grail ' , we have created a glass podium designed as a communications screen displaying the history of @entity7 -- which appears as a huge screen from the outside , " said @entity18			2
" the stadium 's skin is polished like a mirror and it will glow and vibrate thanks to the led lighting system			1
" bold , state - of - the - art and televisual -- the venue will be unimaginably distant to the wartime rubble where @entity7 began its rise from the ashes			0
literally so since the wooden stands at the old @entity69 stadium , adjacent to where work started on the @entity28 on october 27 1944 , had been broken down for firewood by those trying to survive the 1936 - 1939 @entity73			1
that was far from the only damage inflicted upon both the @entity69 and @entity7 during the fighting			0
the @entity78 capital suffered immensely as it became the first @entity46 city to ever be bombed but the @entity81 stronghold held firm against @entity83 until just four days before the war 's end			0
five years later , it was the legendary figure of @entity17 -- who had been elected @entity7 president in 1943 -- who wielded the pickaxe that first broke ground on the stadium that would bear his name			1
yet a betrayal within @entity7 meant the former youth team player , captain and manager almost never had the chance to shape the club 's destiny			0
" on the outbreak of war , @entity28 , unsure of how the wind was to blow , went into hiding , taking refuge in the @entity110 , " wrote @entity102 in his book ' @entity104 : 101 years of @entity7 '			1
" as a good example of how @entity81 @entity7 was at that time , @entity111 , coordinator of the club 's administration and an outspoken communist , actually reported @entity28 to the authorities			0
" in this overwhelmingly anti-fascist atmosphere , it was only the intervention of the @entity78 ambassador to @entity121 that saved @entity17 's bacon			1
" whether this incident prompted @entity125 to turn against the @entity81 is unclear but what is known is that he fought for the @entity83 -- with distinction -- during the war			0
" if @entity130 had n't won the war , nobody would ever have heard of @entity28 -- that much is true , " @entity102 told @entity0			0
despite his initial uncertainties , the qualifier lawyer had backed the right side in the war and having helped the @entity130 take power , they assisted his revival of a club that had been largely destroyed by the fighting -- with even its trophy cabinet stripped bare			0
with a bank of credit from his experiences at war and with @entity7 -- for whom the former striker scored nearly 350 goals -- @entity28 used his connections to create his phoenix			0
" to buy a stadium , you need to buy land and you need credit for that , " @entity102 explained			1
" @entity28 was quite well known , and had been decorated in the @entity73			0
" " the @entity157 lent him the money but they were n't stupid -- there was a future in earning collateral through @entity7			0
" even if they were ranked below city rivals @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity29 at the time			0
the stadium , which opened in 1947 , took shape in what was then a verdant part of northern @entity7 but the city 's growth means the prestigious bank - lined @entity172 is now in the center			1
the challenge for today 's architects is to build the stadium , whose capacity will increase from 85,454 to 90,000 , within its urban confines			1
" i think it will become one of the most iconic stadiums in the world , and the special thing is that it will sit very tightly in the center of a vital town , " said @entity18			0
" normally if you have a stadium in the middle of town , then it tends to be a big black dirt box			2
it 's not a shiny thing living together with the life of the town and this will be the new effect of this building			0
" " it 's a very complex building and it 's going to be a 24 - hour stadium -- open all the time			2
" that 's because @entity7 will effectively play their home games alongside a massive mall , crammed with shops , restaurants and business lounges to sit alongside the hotel , improved club museum and underground parking			2
" it was a challenge to make a new type of stadium -- a real urban stadium , which is not just one - functional , as in a pitch surrounded by spectators , but a multipurpose arena with a retractable roof , " said @entity18			2
" everybody who comes will say ' where is the old stadium ? ' it will be hidden in the new one			2
" " @entity225 , who was absolutely engaged in this project , wants to write history in stadium building , " added @entity18 , referring to @entity7 's current president			2
" he asked for an ' icon for an icon ' but as a clever businessman , he also wanted this icon to earn more money than the existing stadium			1
" the retractable roof , which can open in 15 minutes , will allow the stadium to host events such as music concerts safe in the knowledge that inclement weather will be no danger			1
fittingly for an arena that installed the first ever video screens , the stadium will also present a video screen ' ring ' under the roof that can be seen from every seat in the stadium -- including those in the hotel rooms and business lounges that open onto the pitch			1
" we want it to be the best stadium in the world , with maximum comfort , an icon of architecture and cutting edge , " said @entity225 when the plans were unveiled earlier this year			1
" it will be a world symbol			0
" the construction magnate has a big call to make though			2
to fund -- or partly fund -- a project costing a reported 400 million euros ( $ 507 million ) , @entity225 is looking to sell naming rights to the refurbished @entity28			0
one heavily linked party is the @entity267 ( @entity267 ) , with whom @entity7 are set to announce a partnership agreement on tuesday			2
this will initially be in relation to general sponsorship but @entity78 media is also tipping the @entity275 group to buy the naming rights			0
a report by website ' @entity279 ' even suggests @entity267 could have full naming rights , removing any mention of @entity17 -- a move which could upset @entity7 fans , should they cough up over a billion euros to build a new stadium in a different part of town			1
this rumor has arisen given the legal obstacles currently challenging the refurbishment plans , with a @entity78 court suspending the plans because @entity7 is currently under investigation by the @entity293			1
this is in relation to possible illegal state aid , meaning a key agreement between @entity7 and the @entity163 government with regard to the remodeled @entity28 is temporarily suspended			0
nonetheless , a @entity7 spokesperson told @entity0 last week that the work on the existing site will start in " around two years ' time			1
" meanwhile , the architects of a space - age stadium are pressing ahead with plans for takeoff			1
" we are now preparing everything , " said @entity18			0
" we are just waiting for the green light			0
