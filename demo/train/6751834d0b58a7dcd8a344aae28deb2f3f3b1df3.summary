-- remember when your high school summer reading list included " @entity3 , " " @entity4 , " and " @entity5 in @entity6 ? " you will once you see what these books were renamed before they hit bookshelves			1
@entity12 @entity11 went through quite a few titles for his most well - known book before deciding on " @entity15			1
" if he had n't arrived at that title , high school kids would be pondering the themes of @entity19 in @entity20 ; among @entity21 and @entity22 ; @entity23 to @entity20 ; under the @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 ; gold - @entity27 ; and @entity28			1
@entity30 's publisher did n't feel the title to @entity30 's novel @entity5 in @entity6 was terribly commercial and recommended using the other title he had been kicking around -- " 1984			1
before it was " @entity35 , " it was @entity36 , which is how @entity37 referred to her magnum opus for quite some time			1
in 1956 , a year before the book was released , she decided the title gave away too much plot detail			2
her husband suggested " @entity35 " and it stuck			2
@entity0 : early ( not - so - literary ) jobs of 10 great authors 4			2
the title of @entity49 's famous gothic novel sounded more like a spoof before he landed on " @entity51 " -- one of the names @entity49 considered was @entity54			2
@entity56 's original title for " @entity4 " was used for foreign - language editions -- @entity4			0
he changed the @entity60 version to " @entity4 " at the behest of his publisher			0
it 's because of @entity63 that we use the phrase " @entity66 " today			0
according to some sources , author @entity68 tried out catch - 11 , but because the original " @entity71 " movie was newly in theaters , it was scrapped to avoid confusion			0
he also wanted catch - 18 , but , again , a recent publication made him switch titles to avoid confusion : @entity77 ' @entity78			1
he finally settled on 22			0
" @entity82 " was simply @entity3 before @entity79 decided the title focused too narrowly on one character			0
@entity0 : 10 great parents in fiction 8			0
an apt precursor to the " @entity88 " title @entity87 finally decided on : @entity89			1
@entity90 , @entity90 , quite contrary , how does your garden grow ? secretly , apparently			0
mistress @entity90 , taken from the classic nursery rhyme , was the working title for @entity96 's " @entity95			0
@entity97 was an amazing writer , to be sure , but book titles might not have been his thing			1
before he came across @entity101 ' poem @entity100 , " @entity104 " was going to be called something that happened			1
