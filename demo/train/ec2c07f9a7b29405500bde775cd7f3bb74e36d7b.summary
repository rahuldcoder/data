it 's a hot , sunny sunday morning , and birds are chirping in the trees over the heads of children playing on swings and in a pile of sand in a small park in front of @entity10			1
or what used to be @entity10 , anyway			2
today , it 's a burned - out husk of a building , the ground around it thick with ash and crunchy with broken glass , official documents strewn around and covered with footprints			1
walls are stained black by smoke and fire			0
a dozen or so young men lounge around on the front steps of the building , asserting that they are part of the militia of the @entity28			1
but they look more like drunks with nowhere else to go after a night out			0
but they 're not the only ones hanging around the remains of @entity10 in @entity33 , recently the scene of clashes between supporters of the central government and backers of either independence or union with @entity41 for this part of eastern @entity43			1
@entity44 , a steelworker , is here too , wearing his thick @entity46 factory work jacket despite the heat of the day			0
he 's here to help re-establish order in the city , he said			1
and indeed , despite the destruction of @entity10 , the scene is much calmer than it was a month ago , when the building stood behind a makeshift barricades of tires , bricks and paving stones			1
the only remnants are a coil of barbed wire discarded among spring flowers and a small pile of tires by the street corner			0
did the steelworkers bring calm ? some are giving credit for the restoration of order here to the steelworkers			1
there are tens of thousands of them in this industrial city where factories spew brown and gray smoke along the road into town			1
about 11,000 of them signed up to help patrol @entity33 along with local police , according to the company @entity82 , which employs them			1
the patrols come alongside an agreement signed by a wide range of leaders in @entity33 to try to de-escalate the situation			1
the deal came five days after violence in the city left at least seven people dead and 40 wounded , according to @entity93			1
the steelworkers are backed by their boss , donetsk - based billionaire @entity96 , who came out against both independence and union with @entity41 last week			1
many of them are paid for the time they patrol , @entity82 said			0
but steelworkers are not the only ones on patrol			2
they only make up about a third of the total volunteer force , locals say			0
and hard - core supporters of independence for the region do n't give them credit for restoring order			2
a group of about a dozen steelworkers was jeered as several hundred supporters of independence gathered for a march sunday to mark the killings on may 9 that seem to have been a turning point in the city			1
hard questions for separatist leader but the separatist crowd also has hard questions for the local separatist military commander , @entity124 , an angular man with a shaggy beard and close - cropped hair under a beret			0
they surrounded him and peppered him with questions as he smoked and sweated in the hot sun. he did n't seem to be able to say who 's in control			1
" who will govern ? you will be the first one to come up to me when you do n't have your pension paid			0
the transition of power is a complicated process , " he said			0
and he admitted that the separatists need more men			2
" we need guys who are able to take arms and fight , " he said to the crowd , composed mostly of people middle - aged and older , none of whom volunteered for the job			0
that could be a problem for the self - declared local political leader , @entity152			0
@entity152 vowed firmly sunday that the people of @entity33 would not participate in @entity43 's presidential election scheduled to take place in a week			1
the friendly , slightly chubby man wore a pistol in a holster on his hip as he spoke to journalists outside his headquarters , a tightly secured brick police station taken over by the separatists			2
" we consider trying to open up a polling station and trying to establish an opportunity to vote as a provocation			0
we will treat it as such , " he said			0
but can he carry out the threat ? he all but admitted he does n't have enough men to control the city when asked whether he needed the steelworkers to help maintain order			1
" of course we need everyone , " he said , saying there are 50,000 steelworkers in the area , and that the majority support independence			2
he denied there was a divide between " the steelworkers " and the people			2
" they are patrolling because they support the @entity28 and they want order , " he said			0
as @entity152 spoke , his security guard , a clean - cut man with shiny gray trousers , violet shirt and @entity191 , came over to a journalist , tugged his arm and spoke @entity194			0
" our citizens are the steelworkers , " he said			2
" it is the same			0

an easy calm has *settled* over @entity33 , a city in the eastern part of @entity43
separatists *battled* government supporters last month for control
the strife has mostly come to an end , but no one seems to know who 's running the city
key players in the drama are the city steelworkers
