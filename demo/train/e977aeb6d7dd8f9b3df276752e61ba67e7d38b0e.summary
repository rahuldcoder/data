legal scholars expressed little surprise thursday that the conservative chief justice of the @entity3 -- @entity4 -- proved to be the key vote in upholding the constitutionality of the @entity7			1
breaking down the court 's decision " had the court ruled as the four dissenters would have had it -- in a 5 - 4 decision , red versus blue -- that the signature act of a @entity20 administration was unconstitutional , i think that would have been a very serious threat to the legitimacy of the court , " said @entity10 , a professor at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
what the health care ruling means to you " i think @entity3 are already very skeptical about the rule of law in the @entity3 and believe that the court is essentially a third political branch , " he said in a telephone interview			0
the 57 - year - old @entity4 may have been thinking about the court 's perceived legitimacy and about his own legacy when he crafted the decision , which could n't have been an easy one , @entity10 said			1
" i think he probably had to think very long and hard about how to rule in this case , " the professor said			0
no matter what it does , high court is seen as political in 2005 , when then - president @entity43 tapped @entity4 to be the 17th chief justice of the @entity3 , then - sen. @entity42 voted against his confirmation			1
during his confirmation hearing , @entity4 said he saw his role as a potential justice to make rulings based on the @entity50 and not to set policy -- or , as he described it , " to call balls and strikes , not pitch or bat			1
" " i come before this committee with no agenda , no platform , " he told the @entity55 at the time			0
" i will approach every case with an open mind			0
" since then , @entity4 ' stances on campaign finance and affirmative action had led some observers to brand him a judicial activist			2
@entity42 : @entity68 ruling on health care a victory for all @entity3 but @entity70 , a professor of law at @entity71 in @entity72 , said that @entity4 , " more than almost any justice on the court today , appreciates the institutional role of the @entity68 and @entity3 democracy			1
he 's a student of history , and i think today 's decision was a really resounding reflection of the chief justice 's values , which are ( that ) law is not just politics and the @entity50 is not just politics , and we should think about decisions impartially and dispassionately and come to the right ones			2
" @entity70 , who served in the @entity88 under the @entity90 administration , called thursday 's decision " a resounding victory for the rule of law in @entity3			0
" ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides " i was n't that surprised " by the decision , said @entity97 , a law professor at @entity71 who helped write the brief for the @entity99 that challenged the law			0
" i said from day one that the @entity68 always bends over backwards to uphold laws of @entity103			1
that 's the reason why our fight was always an uphill fight			0
" the law 's ultimate fate , he predicted , will be decided not in any court but at the ballot box in november			2
" the people will decide whether they approve of this tax , this so - called tax that has been imposed upon them , " he said in a telephone interview			0
and the election may also be about appointing justices who do not bend over backward to uphold the laws of @entity103 , he said , " because the @entity103 can not be the judge of the scope of its own powers , and we need an independent judiciary to do that			1
" regardless of what happens this fall , presidential historian @entity125 said that @entity4 himself made a difference with his ruling thursday -- not only affecting how some view the court , but how they see the chief justice himself			1
the historian compared @entity4 to former chief justice @entity133 , a former @entity135 governor and presidential candidate who nonetheless sided with liberal justices -- and @entity20 president @entity138 -- in finding @entity139 to be constitutional			1
" @entity141 has etched himself in history now , " @entity125 told @entity140			2
" this , today , showed that @entity4 had ... deep thought			2
he really played the constitutional lawyer and justice here , and i think his stock goes very high			0
" how the justices voted , what they wrote opinion : are voters ready to move on ?			0

" @entity4 has etched himself in history , " a historian says
a professor says that a vote against @entity7 would *'ve* *threatened* the court 's legitimacy
the court " always bends over backwards " to uphold @entity103 ' laws , another professor says
in his confirmation hearing , @entity4 vowed he *'d* be open - minded and had " no agenda "
