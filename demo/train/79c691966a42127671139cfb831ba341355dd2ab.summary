all eyes and ears were on @entity3 prosecuting attorney @entity2 late monday when he announced there would be no indictment in the shooting death of @entity7			1
but that was n't all he talked about			0
in his nearly 45 - minute statement , including questions , @entity2 touched on a variety of topics : the role of the 24 - hour news cycle , the relative unreliability of eyewitnesses and the evidence and testimony in the case			1
why was decision kept secret for hours ? " i thought of his statement in two parts			0
the first part was an extended whine and complaint about the news media and social media , which i thought was entirely inappropriate and embarrassing , " said @entity28 legal analyst @entity27			1
" i did think it was appropriate for him to go through the evidence , but frankly it was hard to follow and i think a lot of us are going to have to go through the evidence itself and see whether his conclusions are justified , " he said			2
decision to announce verdict at night devastating @entity28 is combing through that evidence now			1
in the meantime , here 's a rundown of @entity2 's main points : the media was a problem the prosecuting attorney blasted the media 's constant need for news			1
" the most significant challenge encountered in this investigation has been the 24 - hour news cycle and its insatiable appetite for something -- for anything -- to talk about , following closely behind with the non-stop rumors on social media , " @entity2 said			1
he acknowledged the lack of detail could be frustrating and might make those already distrustful of the system more suspicious			0
but the secrecy , he said , serves a point			0
" those closely guarded details , especially about the physical evidence , give law enforcement a yardstick for measuring the truthfulness of witnesses , " said @entity2			1
eyewitness accounts must be challenged @entity2 spent a fair amount of time talking about the unreliability of some eyewitness statements			1
some witnesses , he said , changed their stories			0
others were proven wrong by the physical evidence			1
@entity85 , a white officer , fatally shot @entity7 , an unarmed black teen , on august 9			0
@entity2 offered the following example to help prove his case			1
" before the results of the private autopsy were released , witnesses on social media , during interviews with the media , and even during questioning by law enforcement claimed that they saw officer @entity85 stand over @entity7 and fire many rounds into his back			1
" others claimed that officer @entity85 shot mr. @entity7 in the back as mr. @entity7 was running away			0
" however , once the autopsy findings were released showing that @entity7 had not sustained any wound to the back of his body , no additional witnesses made such a claim and several witnesses adjusted their stories in subsequent statements			2
some even admitted that they did not witness the event at all , but merely repeated what they heard , " the prosecuting attorney said			0
read the documents from the grand jury physical evidence was key as opposed to eyewitness accounts , @entity2 stressed the importance and reliability of physical evidence			1
" physical evidence does not change because of public pressure or personal agenda			1
physical evidence does not look away as events unfold , nor does it block out or add to memory			1
physical evidence remains constant and as such is a solid foundation upon which cases are built , " he said			1
@entity85 fired 12 rounds @entity2 told reporters two shots were fired at @entity85 's car , where there was an altercation with @entity7			2
ten more shots were fired east of the car , where the teen had run , he said			0
" a nearby tenant , during a video chat , inadvertently captured the final 10 shots on tape			0
there was a string of several shots , followed by a brief pause , following by another string of several shots , " said @entity2			2
the jurors are the only ones who know the whole story the prosecuting attorney repeatedly praised the good work of the grand jurors			0
" the grand jury worked tirelessly to examine and reexamine all of the testimony of the witnesses and all of the physical evidence			1
they were extremely engaged in the process , asking questions of every witness , requesting specific witnesses , requesting specific information and asking for certain physical evidence , " said @entity2			1
the jurors listened to more than 70 hours of testimony from about 60 witnesses and reviewed hours upon hours of recordings			0
they " poured their hearts and souls into this process ... gave up their lives , " @entity2 said			2
" they accepted and completed this monumental responsibility in a consciousness and expeditious manner , " he told reporters			0
" they are the only people , the only people , who have heard and examined every witness and every piece of evidence			2
" @entity7 's death has opened old wounds @entity2 opened his statement by extending his sympathies to the @entity7 family			2
" i 've said in the past , i know , that regardless of the circumstances here , they lost a loved one to violence , and i know that the pain that accompanies such a loss knows no bounds , " he said			0
no young man should ever be killed by a police officer , just like no officer should be put in that position , said @entity2			2
" this is a loss of a life and it 's a tragic loss , regardless of the circumstances			0
but it 's opened old wounds , and it 's given us an opportunity now to address those wounds , " he said			0
@entity2 added : " i do n't ever want to be back here , so we have to keep that discussion going and everybody has to stay engaged in it			2
this is a horrible tragedy , and we do n't want to see any repeats			0
