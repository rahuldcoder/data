-- i do n't remember where i was going when that stray dog weaved across a busy street near my home			1
but i do remember turning the car around to rescue the white pup with large tan spots that looked more like stains , except for one heart - shaped patch on her side			1
as cars sped past , i stood at the side of the road and waited for her to get comfortable around me			0
eventually , she approached my extended hand and i was able to coax her into my car			0
i named the dog honey and worked with a local rescue group called @entity23 ( @entity23 ) to find the sweet pooch a forever home			1
not every encounter leads to a happy ending			0
but with care , you can help a stray dog find its forever home			1
@entity0 : 11 of the bravest dogs in history exercise caution : you do n't know the dog 's history , so it 's important to avoid getting bitten			1
that means remaining cautious as you approach the dog			1
if it has been roaming for a while , or lived chained outside , the dog may be overly skittish around humans			1
" if it 's afraid , a dog 's first instinct is to run and the safest thing is to let it go , " says @entity43 , a @entity44 police officer who also trains dogs			1
" if the dog 's hackles are raised and its tail is up , turn around and walk away			1
" he advises waiting for the dog to grow more comfortable around you , which may take some time			1
if you fear that the dog may be in danger of being hit by a car , place a call to your local animal control and provide a description of the dog , the area where you saw it and the location in which it was heading			2
if a stray dog becomes a regular sight in your neighborhood , try to build a relationship over time			1
@entity43 suggests keeping a few dog treats in your pocket so that the treats have your scent			2
leave them in that area each time you pass it , and hopefully the dog will grow more comfortable with you			1
when the opportunity arises , stand a safe distance from the dog and allow it to approach you			2
extend your hand , letting the dog sniff you			2
if it tolerates petting , proceed with caution and move slowly			2
@entity0 : tornado survivor says his dogs warned him start the search : when i found honey , our first stop was the neighborhood pet store , where i asked for help spreading the word about her			0
they kindly offered a leash so that i could safely transport her to my house			0
( unlike my rambunctious dog @entity100 , who hates car rides , @entity91 settled in and did n't make a peep			1
if anything , she seemed curious about the next leg of her journey			0
) you should also visit your nearby animal shelter to drop off fliers featuring the dog 's photo , a general description and contact information			2
limit interaction with your pets : until you have a better understanding of the dog 's health and temperament , it 's best to limit interaction with your pets			2
honey 's first destination at my home was the tub , where she got a good long bath			2
fleas dotted her white fur like pepper in a saltshaker			0
after the bath , we took a walk and i snapped a few photographs to post online			0
it took a few days before she got to meet my dog , @entity100			2
@entity43 says that your pets may take issue with others attempting to join their pack			0
during the first meeting , keep dogs leashed and limit interaction to sniffing until they become comfortable together			0
" even with dogs from the same litter , skirmishes will happen , " he warns			0
@entity0 : @entity151 shelters swamped by pets misplaced by storms schedule a checkup : since your new houseguest will be sticking around for a while , it 's best to schedule a checkup			0
your veterinarian can provide clues about the dog 's age and breed			2
the vet also can check for the presence of a microchip , which could ensure a happy reunion			1
if your vet is closed for the day , see if a 24 - hour emergency veterinary clinic is willing to quickly scan the dog for a chip			1
also , those chips are worthless without up - to - date information on file			2
pet owners : make sure you have submitted your most recent contact information to the chip company			0
your vet can provide info on how to upload new information			2
as for your stray , many vets offer discounted services			2
consider getting a rabies vaccination , too			0
if you want to get it spayed or neutered , there are low - cost options available			0
check the @entity192 website for programs that offer free or discounted programs in your area			0
once you get a clean bill of health , it is ok to gradually introduce the new animal to your pets			0
kids should never be left unattended around animals , especially when you do n't know the pet 's history			0
use extreme caution when allowing children to interact with the stray dog			1
@entity0 : how to make the vet less scary for your pet start spreading the news : it can take time for strays to reunite with their owners , if it happens at all			1
start building buzz about your new houseguest by posting fliers in the general vicinity of where you found your stray , as well as pet - friendly locations such as nearby dog parks , pet stores and veterinary clinics			1
sites like @entity230 allow you to post a free classified ad that lasts 180 days announcing your found pet			1
if there is no response after a few weeks , you may need to secure a forever home for the dog			1
connect with a rescue group : most county animal control facilities are packed with pets in need of homes , and they are reluctant to take in a stray			0
if you are willing to foster the dog for a while , a local rescue group may be the best way to help find a forever home			1
rescue groups are like pet pr firms , focused on finding the perfect love connection between pets and people			0
animal shelters happily work with rescue groups because it relieves overcrowding			0
in exchange , rescue groups set up adoption fairs and actively seek pet lovers to adopt. @entity0 : adopting a dog ? how to find the right fit your stray is already at an advantage because you can provide valuable information to prospective owners about its personality , age and demeanor around other people and pets			1
all of these details can help this animal find a home more quickly			1
under @entity278 's guidance , @entity91 also learned a few tricks such as how to pour on the charm during rescue fairs			0
the photo of honey that i took after her first bath was the one that sealed the deal for her future owner			0
thanks to that white dog with a heart - shaped patch on her side , i now travel everywhere with a leash , bottled water and a few dog treats in my car ... just in case life gets in the way			1
i encourage you to do the same			0
the next leg of your journey will never be the same			0

the next time you see a stray dog , consider stopping to help it out
when approaching a stray , exercise caution -- you do n't know anything about this dog
if the dog is going to be staying with you for a while , take it to the vet for a check - up
spread the news on sites like @entity230 so it can find a new home
