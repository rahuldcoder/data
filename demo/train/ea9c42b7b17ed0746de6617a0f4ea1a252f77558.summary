editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose new book is " @entity5 : a @entity6			1
" @entity2 says a beer summit would n't unite @entity9 police veterans and protesters remembering 1968 conflict			1
( @entity3 ) -- beer summits at the @entity13 notwithstanding , not all controversies between the police and the citizens they serve are destined to turn into gauzy , orchestrated " teachable moments			1
" some wounds are so deep that they just may last forever			2
which is a lesson in itself			2
as interesting an evening as i have spent this year took place earlier this summer on a @entity9 , @entity24 , street well west of downtown			1
" just wanted to come spend time with some old friends , " said @entity26 , 67 , as he arrived at the lodge of the @entity28 , next door to a plumbers ' union training center			0
he had plenty of company			0
this was the first reunion of @entity9 police officers assigned to the streets during the @entity40			1
not to diminish the heat of the emotions in @entity43 , @entity44 , this summer , but in terms of international attention being focused on a police department , what happened in @entity43 was rather mild			2
the mayhem on the streets of @entity9 during that long - ago august week , captured on film and in still photographs , has emblemized a moment in history			1
a federal commission used the term " police riot " ; for more than 40 years the officers who were there have been offended and angry about that			1
so here they were in 2009 , retirees in shorts and in golf shirts , in natty blazers and in khaki trousers			0
" a celebration ? " said @entity66 , 66			0
" a celebration of what ? this is just some former police officers getting together to remember when we were asked to protect a great @entity73 city			2
" he fully understood it was n't as simple as that ; it never has been			2
the organizers of the reunion had elected to use uncompromising language on the web site announcing the event			2
the anti-war demonstrators of 1968 were " @entity88 street thugs " ; criticism of the actions of the police was " unwarranted , inaccurate and wrong			1
" the language was destined to get attention , and it did			0
thus , half a block to the west of the lodge this summer , protesters were gathering behind police barricades			1
they felt that the organizers of the police reunion had mischaracterized and purposely insulted the anti-vietnam war demonstrators of 1968 ; the police , for their part , have long believed that they were the ones who were provoked at that @entity103 convention , that they were goaded in ways that were guaranteed to culminate with violent confrontations			1
now , on this summer evening in 2009 , the protesters , many of them not born in 1968 , looked toward the arriving retired officers and chanted : " no justice ! no peace ! no riot police ! " the whole world was n't watching			1
in @entity112 near @entity9 's lakefront -- site of some of the ugliest convention - week battles of 1968 -- hundreds of thousands of people had congregated on this day in 2009			1
it had nothing to do with the police reunion			1
@entity122 , the annual food - and - music festival , had opened its 10 - day run			2
@entity125 distant from that , out on @entity127 , there were perhaps a few hundred retired officers in the lodge , and a lesser number of demonstrators to the west			0
anyone three blocks away would have been unaware of either group			0
many of the marquee players from the famous @entity103 convention -- @entity137 and @entity138 from the dissenters , the first mayor @entity140 from the city , @entity142 and @entity143 from the national media that spread the pictures -- are dead			0
and the former police officers who were approaching the front door of the lodge ? " i know there were probably a lot of peaceful demonstrators in ' 68 who did n't want all that to happen , " said @entity146 , 63 , who had flown up from his home in @entity148 , @entity149			1
the one remnant from his life as a street cop is that the nickname his buddies had for him -- " @entity163 " -- is now , in retirement , a proud part of his e-mail address			0
they 're on the back nine of life			0
" you ask about your buddy -- you say , ' how 's so - and - so doing ? ' " said @entity170 , 62 , who was 21 during convention week			2
" you get the answer : ' he died ' " the calls of this year 's protesters summoned certain echoes			1
@entity170 said : " i was the age of the demonstrators in ' 68			0
i was a kid , too			0
but all they saw was the uniform			0
" the two sides did n't speak to each other then , and not much seemed to have changed			1
" i think it 's fine they 're here , " said retired officer @entity184			0
" it 's a nice night			0
they 're not hurting anyone			0
" but the people chanting , kept at a distance , could not hear him			0
@entity194 , 68 , formerly of the @entity195 , said , " was i angry convention week ? no. i was just so amazed that we were being faced with what we were being faced with			0
" there 's never going to be common ground , or an inch given on either side , even after everyone who was at the famous convention is gone			1
" i had served as a @entity207 corporal in @entity208 for 13 months , " said @entity205 , 64			0
" and then i came home and joined the @entity9 police and there i was			1
" the truly radical thing , on a 21st - century summer evening , would have been for someone to take down the wooden barricades at the end of the block and let the cops and those who were chanting toward them get together and talk			2
but if that was going to happen , it would have happened long ago			0
" i was n't a big fan of the war , either , " said retired patrol officer @entity170 , on a night so pretty it made you half - believe that life can be like that			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : not all police - citizen disputes can be healed by a " beer summit "
he says 1968 @entity9 police veterans held a reunion this year
he says their *publicity* *sparked* protesters , who held a rally nearby
@entity2 : more than 40 years later , the sides have n't found common ground
