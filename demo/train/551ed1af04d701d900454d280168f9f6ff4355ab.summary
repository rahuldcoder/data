@entity0 -- to many people in @entity4 , @entity2 is the country 's eternal father -- " no @entity2 , no @entity4 , " is the mantra often repeated by his supporters			1
his giant portrait hangs over the gate of @entity0 's ancient @entity10 like that of an emperor			0
across the city , thousands flock every day to gaze at his body lying preserved in a mausoleum in @entity17			0
his picture holds pride of place in many houses in villages across @entity4			2
to these people he remains a symbol of strength , a man born a peasant -- albeit a somewhat comfortable one -- who rose to lead the people 's army of the @entity31 and unite a warring country			2
lately , @entity2 has re-emerged as the face of resistance and defiance more than three decades after his death			2
young @entity4 protesters have carried his image aloft during protests against @entity39 over disputed islands in the region			2
one young woman from @entity2 's home village in hunan province lamented how weak she thought her country 's leaders have become -- that if @entity2 were still alive then @entity4 would just take the islands			1
despite this reverence , @entity2 's remains a flawed legacy			1
for those who see strength in his face , others remember fear : revolution , paranoia , famine , brutality and tens of millions of deaths			0
@entity4 suffered during high - profile campaigns introduced by @entity2 , such as the " @entity60 , " where millions of people died through starvation or persecution during a catastrophic attempt to modernize @entity4 between 1958 and 1961			1
another disastrous period , known as the " @entity66 , " began in 1966 with the intention of reviving the revolutionary spirit of @entity69			1
but over the next decade , millions of young people were forcibly removed from cities to learn from peasants in the countryside -- viewed as ideological role models by @entity2 -- causing massive social and economic upheaval			2
on the streets of @entity0 , when we mention @entity2 's name , seeking people 's opinion , some are wary			1
" why are you asking me this ? " asks one woman as she scurried away from our cameras			0
" where is your identification , you should n't be talking about this , " she warned			0
another young woman was more forthright : @entity4 needs no more of @entity2			1
" i think that chairman @entity2 is a rather extreme person			2
we do n't really need those who are too extreme ; instead , we need people who can connect @entity4 with the international community			2
in the long run , this would be best for @entity4 , " she said			0
but many are wrapped up in an almost revolutionary nostalgia			0
" the current leaders should be as strong as @entity2 , " one @entity0 resident said			0
" for the @entity4 people , he represents belief , a great man , " said another			0
as the @entity31 prepares for its 18th @entity105 on thursday , when it will name a new leader , it will also reflect on a country that would be unrecognizable to @entity2			1
this is no longer the land of gray suits and bicycles , it 's all about @entity114 cars and @entity116 suits for many @entity4 now			1
the country that once could n't feed itself is now the world 's second - largest economy and an emerging superpower to rival the @entity120			1
@entity2 's peasant revolution has given way to " socialism with @entity4 characteristics			1
" yet @entity2 remains inescapable , not just in the minds of ordinary people nostalgic for the past , but at the heart of the party itself			0
@entity129 , once tipped as a potential future president himself whose father was a @entity2 acolyte , launched an audacious bid to re-model the party in @entity2 's image			1
as chief of the massive metropolis of @entity137 , @entity129 launched huge @entity66 - style rallies , encouraging the singing of red songs -- songs popular during the country 's revolution -- and chanting @entity2 - era slogans			1
@entity129 won great favor with ordinary people			0
but as his popularity rose , his standing in a nervous @entity31 diminished			0
according to those close to him , @entity129 played with fire			0
" i think it was a huge misjudgment of @entity129			0
going back to @entity2 's path is definitely not an option			1
that has proven to be a dead end			0
@entity2 led a road to ruin , " @entity156 , a @entity137 scholar who knows @entity129 and his wife , told @entity1			0
as the world now knows , @entity129 is in disgrace and never got a chance to spread his new " gospel of @entity2			2
" he 's been stripped of his party positions and faces prosecution in the wake of a political scandal while his wife , @entity168 , is in prison convicted of killing a @entity171 business associate			0
this scandal has torn open the veil of secrecy around the party , and all of this in a year of political transition with a new generation led by @entity179 , the current vice president , preparing to take the helm			0
like @entity129 , @entity179 is a " princeling , " the son of one of @entity2 's revolutionary inner circle			1
@entity179 will inherit a different party -- the days of one supreme leader are over , according to long - time @entity4 watcher @entity187			1
" this is a system that is based on consensus , not structured any longer to have a single dominant figure like a @entity2 or a @entity192 , " he said			2
yet @entity179 must also walk the " maze of @entity2 , " for he is a son of @entity4 's past as much as a leader of its future			1
like all @entity4 , he will look at @entity2 's image and know the power of its symbolism , yet he will look past that and know his country 's fate lies , perhaps , with moving even further from @entity2 's idea of @entity4 .			1

@entity2 can divide opinion in @entity4 , *inspiring* nostalgia in some and fear in others
@entity2 's " @entity60 " and " @entity66 " was disastrous for @entity4
@entity4 is now less about one supreme leader and more about ruling by consensus
the country has grown into the world 's second largest economy behind the @entity120
