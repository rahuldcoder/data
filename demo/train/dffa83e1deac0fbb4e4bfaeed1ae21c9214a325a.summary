-- the @entity2 pipeline has turned into a poster child for political posturing			1
while it is merely one of many pipelines crisscrossing @entity9 , this project has become " red meat " that both sides of the congressional aisle are using to weaken each other in an election season			0
to make matters more complicated , @entity17 public and private - sector officials have jumped into the fray by coming to town to extol the virtues of the pipeline			2
the battle has become so heated it 's easy to lose sight of the main question on which the fate of the pipeline should rest -- whether the project is in @entity9 's national interest and what are the measurable benefits and costs			1
the pipeline , as originally proposed , would bring crude oil from the tar sands of northern @entity17 through the @entity33 to the oil refineries in @entity35 and @entity36 , primarily for export			2
supporters tout that the project would bring much needed jobs			0
opponents warn of environmental risks			0
unfortunately , the fight over whether to greenlight @entity2 is creating collateral damage that vastly outweighs the marginal benefit either side will gain from sticking to its current position			1
three victims among many deserve special mention : the @entity51 transportation bill , @entity51 - @entity17 relations and @entity9 's strategic interests			1
the transportation bill , now in its ninth extension , is a critical piece of infrastructure legislation that consolidates more than 100 separate programs into just five major investment categories ( for efficiency ) and establishes performance standards for these investments ( no more " bridges to nowhere " )			2
it is finally in the last stage of negotiations between the @entity67 and @entity68			0
while the @entity68 passed a bill in march in a bipartisan 72 - 24 vote , the @entity67 has only a shell bill to offer , plus its " non-negotiable " insistence on mandatory approval of @entity2			0
the @entity68 majority has its own bazooka : a presidential veto if @entity2 is in the bill			0
there is a good possibility that a sound , bipartisan bill authorizing a program so important to our future economic growth -- infrastructure -- will be tossed aside for a 10th extension and kicked into a new @entity86 to start all over from scratch			0
if this happens , both parties must stand to account in november for the damage done to our economy			0
@entity9 , which in 10 years has fallen from fifth to 23rd place in the quality of its infrastructure compared with its global competitors , will be the loser if the transportation bill becomes a victim of @entity2			1
if the project ca n't be resolved soon , @entity51 - @entity17 relations could also be compromised			1
@entity17 is not only our largest trading partner but also a great friend			0
today , @entity17 supplies the largest share of @entity51 oil imports and buys our products with the money we pay them for it			2
yet the @entity17 government risks becoming a pawn in our domestic political catfight			0
@entity2 is being egged on by the fossil fuel lobbyists on both sides of the border who have urged @entity17 to double down against the initial permit denial and " turn up the political heat			2
" in a recent meeting with representatives of the @entity17 government , a @entity51 oil industry representative argued that @entity17 should have pulled its ambassador when the @entity2 permit was initially denied			1
yet the @entity17 have pushed hard for @entity2 approval , bringing in both prime minister @entity127 and @entity129 premier @entity128 to praise the pipeline and hosting the @entity131 while in town to brief @entity86 on the merits of the pipeline			1
all the pressures aside , the @entity51 needs to pause and think carefully about its national interest			1
our future energy balance and supply chain should not be short - stopped by attaching @entity2 as a nongermane rider to a transportation bill for temporary political gain			1
politicians come and go ; nations generally do not			0
the long - term strategic interests of both @entity17 and the @entity51 are better served if all parties involved heed the analysis under way in the @entity149 rather than resort to legislative fiat or a presidential veto			1
calmer heads are already working on the details of a better proposal : a new route , improved technology and perhaps cleaner oil			0
the @entity17 government should vigorously and publicly embrace the existing @entity149 analysis and strongly oppose attaching @entity2 as a rider to the transportation bill			1
@entity17 should not be complicit in rushed , political decisions -- it should play by the rules			0
@entity86 should resist the temptation to use @entity2 as an opportunity for political brinkmanship			2
both democrats and @entity169 need to make sure that the real issues are n't lost in the partisan noise of @entity172 and that we do our best to avoid all the collateral damage			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity177 : @entity51 needs to think carefully about its national interest in considering pipeline
@entity177 : fight over @entity2 project is creating *unnecessary* collateral damage
he says victims *include* transportation bill , relations with @entity17 , @entity51 strategic interests
@entity177 : @entity86 needs to focus on real issues instead of partisan *bickering*
