-- we have a @entity2 , not a @entity3			2
that is an essential distinction			0
it is brought into sharp relief by politicized demands that @entity12 , having just been acquitted of murder by the state of @entity11 , be subjected to a second prosecution -- a federal civil rights indictment -- over the shooting death of @entity16			1
the @entity2 has earned the trust of the @entity19 courts precisely because it resists the politicization of law enforcement			2
its tradition is to ensure the equal protection of law for every @entity19 , to evaluate cases strictly on the basis of facts and law , and to recognize its obligations not only to the community but also to criminal suspects			1
yet , though attorney general @entity34 never tires of reminding us about the due process owed even to foreign terrorists who 've confessed to mass murder , the principle does not seem to apply to @entity12 , an @entity19 now acquitted of murder			1
even if the @entity2 never files criminal charges against @entity12 -- which is likely given the implausibility of obtaining a conviction -- it is extremely inappropriate for law enforcement officials , particularly the @entity19 attorney general , to engage in a running extrajudicial commentary that taints the jury pool and ratchets up the investigative anxiety for a citizen who is presumed innocent and has been acquitted			1
law enforcement officials speak in court -- with public charges , if prosecutors have the evidence to back them up			0
the justice system is not a morality play			0
it is not designed to right every wrong , nor has it the capacity to remediate tragedy , such as the indescribable pain the @entity16 family endures after the loss of their 17 - year - old son			0
in the face of such tragedy , the human instinct to demand some kind of " justice " -- social , poetic or cosmic -- is something we all feel			0
but that is not the justice our legal system exists to dispense			0
federal courts prosaically apply established law to provable facts , and they rely heavily on the @entity2 to perform that duty faithfully			1
when a popular political narrative -- such as the left 's portrayal of racism as the root cause of many @entity19 ills -- crashes into uncongenial facts , the justice system is the place where the narrative must yield , and the @entity2 is supposed to ensure that it does			1
sadly , just the opposite has happened in the @entity12 case			1
it has been bereft from the start both of proof that @entity12 had the requisite criminal intent to sustain a murder charge and of evidence to refute his well - corroborated claim of self - defense			2
that is why veteran police investigators initially declined to file charges			0
yet @entity34 and his subordinates joined in the effort to induce @entity11 to file charges , unabashedly making common cause with the likes of the rev. @entity106 , whose metier is racially divisive demagoguery			0
attending an @entity111 rally with @entity106 , @entity34 saber - rattled about filing a civil rights case			1
as the attorney general well knew , his inappropriate chatter would be construed as a suggestion that @entity11 had abdicated its responsibilities by declining to prosecute a purportedly racist murderer			1
simultaneously , @entity119 's @entity118 worked closely with @entity111 activists to pressure @entity11 gov. @entity121 into reversing the police determination that there was no case			0
@entity121 finally caved , appointing the compliant special prosecutor @entity125 , who dutifully lodged a groundless second - degree murder charge			0
standard , prudent @entity2 practice has always discouraged commentary on criminal investigations outside the public record			2
that is for the politicians			0
law enforcement is not supposed to speak until the government is ready to file public charges and back them up in court			0
to the contrary , @entity34 has engaged in an extrajudicial publicity campaign , and now finds himself in the hot seat : it 's been over a year since he promised to file charges if warranted by the facts , and the facts have long been known -- indeed , they 've been tried in court			2
obviously , it is easier to promise to keep investigating -- and to keep alive a race narrative dear to president @entity148 's political base -- than to acknowledge that there is no federal case against @entity12			1
the insurmountable proof problems @entity11 prosecutors faced do not even begin to describe the challenges that would confront a federal case			1
a civil rights case would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity12 shot @entity16 out of racial animus			1
there is no evidence that @entity12 has ever been a racist -- jurors in the @entity11 case say race was not relevant to the case , and the @entity166 , after investigating extensively for months , has been unable to find proof of a racial motivation			0
furthermore , a federal prosecution would require proof that @entity12 was trying to prevent @entity16 's enjoyment of some statutorily specified civil right -- like attending school , applying for a job , staying in a hotel , going to a restaurant , or participating in a federal program			1
the @entity178 altercation was purely local with no federal implications			0
finally , in light of the @entity2 's heavy - handed role in pressuring @entity11 to bring a case that police originally decided not to charge , there may be a serious question whether the " dual sovereignty " exception to double jeopardy -- allowing a federal prosecution despite a state acquittal -- applies			2
this is not a federal case			2
if real justice had been served , it would never have been a criminal case at all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity199 : @entity2 should handle cases based strictly on facts and law
@entity197 : attorney general @entity34 should not have politicized the @entity12 case
he says @entity12 case is not a federal case because civil rights was not an issue
@entity197 : if justice had been served , @entity12 case would never have been a criminal case
