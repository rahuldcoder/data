" the stark reality facing the @entity7 each year is thousands of shooting victims and hundreds of murders committed with a gun			0
but on the other side of this case is another feature of government : certain fundamental rights are protected by the @entity18 , put outside government 's reach , including the right to keep and bear arms for self - defense under the @entity24 , " wrote @entity12 district judge @entity11			1
" @entity2 's ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms , " he continued			2
