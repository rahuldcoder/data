@entity0 -- out of sheer boredom , @entity2 , in @entity3 , became a forward artillery observer , one of the most dangerous jobs available			1
" i lied to my mom and told her it was assigned , " he recalled			2
" i did n't want to tell her i thought it was exciting			2
" forward artillery observers are among the first to go behind enemy lines , scouting for enemy installations and troop formations , targeting them for artillery strikes			2
in combat , he used an artillery periscope to spot enemy positions and direct cannon fire			2
@entity2 had been in the @entity22 since 1940 , but after the attack on @entity27 , many @entity25 - @entity24 soldiers were discharged , and even those kept on were disarmed and reassigned			1
" they took our rifles away , they did n't know what to do with us , " @entity2 said			1
at first , the @entity22 made him a mechanic , a job he found tedious			0
" except for reveille at 6 o'clock in the morning , we had duties that were entirely like civilians			0
" in 1943 , the creation of the segregated @entity37 allowed @entity25 - @entity24 to prove their loyalty to the @entity24			1
@entity2 and thousands of other @entity39 welcomed the chance to demonstrate their courage in combat			1
" the majority got into the infantry , and that 's what i expected , but i was happy to be in the artillery , " he said			1
on wednesday , @entity2 , along with more than 1,000 members of the 100th battalion , 442nd @entity37 , will be honored on @entity50 with a @entity51 for their extraordinary accomplishments in @entity53 is the nation 's highest civilian award			1

he even got to walk around the @entity65 , @entity67 's residence near his famed " @entity70 " retreat in the @entity69			2
before deploying to @entity71 , @entity2 had seen and been behind the barbed wire that surrounded his family 's barracks at @entity75 in southeast @entity76			1
after the attack on @entity27 , @entity25 - @entity24 were labeled " enemy aliens , " and more than 110,000 were sent to internment camps across the @entity24			1
though he was concerned , @entity2 says that he and his family accepted this as something that had to be done			1
" it was a strange feeling to have an armed guard give me a pass in order to be let in , " he said			0
@entity2 captured many of his wartime experiences with his small @entity90 camera			1
under orders not to bring cameras , he brought one anyway , as he wanted to keep a record			0
" it was quite unique because no one to my knowledge had a camera , they all obeyed orders			0
i bent them whenever possible			0
" @entity2 is now 92 years old , a retired @entity101 professor who spends his days inside a laboratory using high - tech microscopy equipment to view his cell specimens			1
his photographs still generate a range of emotions			0
many are group shots of smiling war buddies , posing near their howitzers or against scenic backdrops			0
some feature the capture of @entity116 soldiers or the damaged buildings of the @entity65 , and others contain more solemn reminders of the concentration camps , which evoke a sense of indignation			0
@entity124 's unit , the 522nd @entity123 , liberated concentration camp prisoners from a subcamp of @entity128 , a town in southern @entity116			2
" it was an awful feeling , hearing a @entity132 teenager , in his gray uniform , translate what had happened , " he recalled			0
as he snapped photos of the survivors , he thought of his parents and the stark difference in treatment between the @entity116 and @entity24 camps			0
" i have objected to @entity24 calling the @entity24 relocation centers ' concentration camps , ' because in my mind , they were nothing compared to the emaciated bodies and crematoria we found in @entity116 , " he said			0
the 442nd motto was " @entity37 , " a saying that rings true for the regiment 's battle - hardened soldiers			1
most notably , it related to the famous rescue of the @entity154 in @entity155 in october 1944 , when around 230 men in the @entity157 , 36th @entity158 , were surrounded by @entity116 forces in the @entity160			0
@entity2 still gets goose bumps talking about it			1
the 442nd dug foxholes in the dense woods , as trees burst and casualties mounted from shrapnel			2
" it was so dark , you could n't see the man in front of you , " he said			0
artillery continued to rain down on them			0
on the fifth day , two infantry companies , plus 2nd @entity174 and his three men , were ordered to charge the hill and reach the 141st			0
the hill was later renamed @entity180			0
" ' @entity181 ' was a @entity25 battle cry , " @entity2 explained			1
the @entity25 were notorious for massed suicidal offenses , and now the @entity24 were directing the same charge at the @entity116			1
@entity2 and the three men under his command were part of the @entity188 and i companies that sent up 371 men			1
only 25 soldiers reached the battalion unhurt ; including @entity2 and his three artillerymen			1
" i lost so many colleagues in the rescue , " @entity2 recalled , his voice hoarse			1
the 442nd suffered 800 casualties in less than a week			2
" i do n't know why i was so fortunate			0
i 'm very grateful for the time given to me			0
i aim to make the most of it			0
" needless to say , @entity2 is proud of his regiment 's accomplishments and humbled by the recognition after all these years			1
he believes this unit 's dedication to @entity24 patriotism is finally being noticed			2
" despite the fact that we were rounded up , segregated and interned , i think the message i would like to spread is that our loyalty to the @entity24 is unquestioned			0
