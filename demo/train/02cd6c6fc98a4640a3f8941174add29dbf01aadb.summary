@entity0 believes that there are two types of people in the world : those who like dead animals , and those who do n't			1
being a professional fine - art taxidermist , it 's obvious what category he places himself			1
" i know it 's hard to believe , but the presence of death has nothing to do with it for me , " says the @entity12 artist			1
" it 's about shapes , color and construction , not death			1
but if you think it 's gross , i ca n't even start to explain the beauty to you			1
" then , after a moment of reflection , he adds : " i 'm not weird			2
" as part of the @entity28 collective -- which makes the unusual move of including @entity32 as a member -- @entity0 and his artistic partner , @entity34 , create extraordinary taxidermy artworks that have been and acclaimed all over the world			1
the pieces are inspired by the paintings of @entity40 painters like @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , and have been called " flamboyant 17th century luxury " the blend of retro - cool and exquisite workmanship led one reviewer to say that it " elevates taxidermy to a higher plane "			1
there is no doubt : @entity0 and @entity34 -- who sport wild hair and beards and wear matching leather aprons -- are the hottest thing to happen to taxidermy in decades			1
demand is growing for their work , with pieces selling for between £ 2,000 and £ 25,000			2
n 25 november , their latest exhibition will be coming to the @entity62 in @entity63			2
late starter given these achievements , many find it hard to believe that @entity0 has only been in the game for three years			2
" i was 47 years old , and was running my own advertising agency , " he recalls			2
" we were on a family holiday in @entity72 , and over dinner i just said to my wife , ' i know what i want to do			2
i want to be a taxidermist '			2
" it had never occurred to me before that day , and it changed my life overnight			2
" his wife " has accepted it " , and his two children , he says , " love it "			0
his 15 - year - old son helps with the stuffing , and his six - year - old daughter likes it too -- though " she gets a bit worried when i start stroking the cat			0
" ( @entity89 has a cat and a dog , which he has no intention of stuffing			0
) part of the secret to the duo 's success is the quality that is evident from their work			1
in some quarters taxidermy has become quite trendy over recent years , but it 's rare to find stuffed animals that can genuinely be mistaken for living creatures			1
" we use the old - fashioned , @entity108 methods , " he explains			1
" in those days , labor was not so expensive so they took their time over everything			0
but now mass production has taken over , so speed has taken over			0
" most modern taxidermists buy a ready - made mannequin and stretch the skin over the top			0
" but we take months over each animal			0
we do it as it should be done , and the results speak for themselves			0
it takes months rather than hours			0
" the beauty of death among the works of art van @entity126 and @entity34 have produced are a beautiful flamingo with raised wings ; a parrot with its feathers spread into an artistic action pose ; a monkey with its tail raised in a flamboyant circle ; and a red - billed , blue magpie , wings and tail stretched back as if in some magical flight			1
" i love birds , " says van @entity126			0
" we have a network of breeders and zoos who give us a call when a rare animal dies			0
" as an artist , it 's a big advantage to start with something beautiful in itself			1
you ca n't use paint to make colors like some birds have			0
the intensity of the colors and the layers of their feathers is breathtaking			0
" in retrospect , van @entity126 's sudden epiphany three years ago was not such a surprise			1
since he was a child , he says , he was fascinated by dead animals , and has been collecting skulls all his life			0
( the centerpiece of his collection is the skull of a duck - billed platypus			0
) " in a way , it 's about owning something beautiful , " he says			2
" as a child you do n't really own anything , but when you find a skull , you have a feeling that this is something worth a lot			0
" that is the feeling that has stayed with me			0
i know it 's hard to believe , but it 's about capturing and holding beauty , not death			1
" ' @entity188 gardens ' : when art , design and a whole load of plants collide glamor and grieving : how the @entity194 dressed for death intoxicating investment : how some whisky lovers are now making millions this expressionist painted the world 's most radical nudes -- 100 years ago			1

two @entity12 artists are revolutionizing the world of taxidermy
they have returned to @entity108 *techniques* , producing works of *exceptional* quality
it 's not about death , it 's about beauty , they say
