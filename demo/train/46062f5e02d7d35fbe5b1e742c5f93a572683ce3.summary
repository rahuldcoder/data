-- @entity1 finally settled on a new @entity3 handle , letting go of the @ mrskutcher name that she used to grow popular on the social networking site			1
after announcing her split from @entity9 last november , the actress left @entity3 for a while			1
but she recently resurfaced and asked for help in determining a new handle			0
as of today , @entity1 decided that her followers will now know her as " justdemi			1
" " so hard finding a name that was fun somewhat playful and available			0
so for now it will be @ justdemi it could grow on me ! " she wrote on her account			1
it sounds like ms. @entity1 is flexible about her choice â € ” so it could change again			2
and for a woman who still goes by her first husband 's last name , we 're surprised she made such a big deal about what she 's called on @entity3			2
although we are still hoping she 'll change her mind and go with @ theexmrswillis			0
