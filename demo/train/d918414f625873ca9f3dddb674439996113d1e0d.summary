-- you know what 's relatively easy ? fixing a website			0
you know what 's really hard ? ensuring access to affordable , quality health insurance for every single @entity8 and improving our broken health care system in the process			1
in the back - and - forth about the @entity13 exchange websites , let 's not lose sight of the ultimate goal of health care reform -- a goal that , even with the exchanges problems , we are steadily achieving			1
less than 17 days into the signup period , the @entity20 had already enrolled 56,000 people under the @entity24 expansion in @entity13 -- and reduced the state 's percentage of uninsured by 10 %			1
in @entity28 , over 150,000 people have signed up for a private insurance plan through the state 's exchange website -- including , by the way , me			1
in @entity35 , a state that has more than 640,000 residents without health insurance , the state insurance exchange is signing up 1,000 people per day , " a great rate and a great success so far " says @entity42 gov. @entity41			1
in @entity44 , 31,000 people have enrolled in @entity24 coverage , 4,500 have enrolled in private health plans and an additional 56,000 state residents have completed applications			1
other states , especially those that worked to implement their own insurance exchanges and expand @entity24 under the health reform law , are seeing similar success -- contrasted with those states that have , mainly for ideological reasons , sabotaged implementation			1
and even still , the increased access to insurance through private market exchanges and @entity24 expansion is only one aspect of the larger reform law			2
already , 3.4 million young americans have been able to stay on their parents ' insurance plans until age 26			1
already , millions of @entity8 have benefited from the ban on insurance companies denying coverage because of preexisting conditions , a ban that will take full effect next year			2
already , we 're all benefiting from the law ending lifetime and annual limits on the amount of coverage health insurance provides , and ending the practice of insurance companies ' arbitrarily canceling coverage in the wake of catastrophic illness			2
the @entity13 exchange websites can run fast as lightning or slow as molasses but , regardless , these reforms are already helping millions of @entity8 automatically			1
it 's also helpful to put the exchange websites into some perspective			0
we 're a little over one - tenth of the way through the current enrollment period			0
people have until december 15 to complete their applications if they want coverage to begin on january 1 , 2014			0
and then we all have until february 15 , 2014 to enroll in private insurance coverage before being subject to the individual mandate penalty			0
according to psychology studies , 20 % of @entity8 are chronic procrastinators			2
at least 95 % of @entity8 say they procrastinate regularly			2
plus , to be clear , picking among multiple health insurance options is a bit more complicated than buying a new t - shirt			2
so if millions of @entity8 are waiting until the last second to enroll in @entity13 , we should n't just chalk that up to the law 's failure or website problems but to inevitable human nature			1
the good news is , by the time most people seeking insurance get around to enrolling , whether by december 15 or february 15 , the website kinks will undoubtedly have long been ironed out			0
@entity109 was n't built in a day			0
and neither was any major government initiative			0
from @entity112 to @entity113 to the @entity114 to the income tax , other significant government programs were initially as overrun with snafus as they were with critiques			1
but eventually , employers figured out how to include workers ' names and @entity112 numbers in their earnings reports and the website for @entity124 was successfully debugged			0
a few geeks locked in a room with a case of @entity128 will fix the @entity13 websites			2
but all the computer programmers and pundits and conservative nay - sayers in the land could n't fix the fact that , three years ago , our health care costs were skyrocketing , tens of millions of @entity8 lacked health insurance and 14,000 more were losing their coverage every day			1
we needed a law to fix that			0
thankfully , we now have one			0
and whatever the ups and downs of the websites , the @entity13 is working			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			0

@entity146 : health exchange site fix is easy ; getting @entity8 covered is hard
she says *hundreds* of thousands have enrolled for insurance under @entity13
she says law has brought insurance *protections* , kept 3.4 million young people insured
@entity146 : many government programs have rough start . the goal is worthy and in sight
