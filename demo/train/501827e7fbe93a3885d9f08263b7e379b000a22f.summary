@entity0 , @entity1 have agreed that troops from the @entity8 regional block can be based in the capital of @entity0 , as a step toward ending conflict in the northern part of the country			1
according to the agreement between the @entity1 government and @entity4 , authorities have given the green light for a logistics base on the outskirts of the city			1
" there will be no foreign troops fighting in the capital			2
in return , @entity4 requires operational headquarters and a base in @entity0 together with a police force , " said @entity24 , communications officer at @entity1 's @entity26			1
@entity31 backing for the force will be sought this week by the @entity1 government and @entity4 , and is likely to be followed by further negotiations			2
" a crisis like this is not solved over night			0
it takes time and preparation			0
though , when that day comes , the @entity1 army is ready to go in the north , " said @entity39			2
following a military coup in the capital in march , @entity42 seized control of two - thirds of the @entity48 - sized nation			1
@entity1 -- seen as a stable democracy and an example for other less stable countries in the region -- was thrown into chaos			2
@entity55 groups -- some of them with links to @entity57 , or @entity57 -- swiftly seized key towns in the vast and scarcely populated north			0
soon after taking the towns of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , they implemented a hardline form of sharia law including capital and corporal punishments for relatively minor offenses			0
thieves had their hands and feet amputated while a couple accused of adultery were stoned to death			0
plans for a large presence of @entity4 troops has been fueling political tensions in @entity0 for weeks			1
over the last month , the @entity8 regional block has had 3,300 regional troops on standby waiting for a go - ahead from @entity0			1
meanwhile interim president @entity82 has opposed a regional force based in @entity0			1
capt. @entity84 , who led a military junta that toppled the government in march , has made it clear that he does not want @entity4 troops in the south of the country , which he argues is already secured by the @entity1 military			1
resistance to an actual force in the @entity1 capital has also come from several groups , outspoken politicians and the @entity1 people worried about foreign troops flooding into the capital			1
the request for 3,000 troops to help defeat the @entity42 and regain control of the north will be considered during a meeting chaired by @entity31 secretary general ban ki - moon on the sidelines of the @entity106 on wednesday			1
before the deployment can go ahead , it will need a mandate from the @entity110 , which earlier rejected an intervention plan because of a lack of detail			0
following the agreement announced sunday regarding @entity4 troops , there are still uncertainties about the details of troop deployment			2
" the question is if the @entity1 military is ready to go fight in the north			1
so far i have not seen any proof of this , " says @entity122 , a researcher with the @entity123 , a @entity124 - based nongovernment organiztion seeking to end conflicts			0
" the government is still very disorganized and has not been able to agree with the @entity1 military regarding troops deployment , " said @entity122 , from @entity128 in neighboring @entity129			1
given that most of the @entity55 northern strongholds are in urbanized areas , a military intervention risks harming civilians and even more displacement			0
according to @entity31 figures , over 450,000 @entity1 have already been displaced from their homes -- an @entity4 intervention could well raise that number			0
" in any scenario a military intervention will have serious humanitarian implications			0
to date , there has been very little fighting since government forces fled the north -- for the most part armed groups simply carved up the territory			0
but once the government in @entity0 begins to act , conflict in the north will escalate , " said @entity151 at the @entity152 liazon office in @entity0			1
at some point , argues @entity122 , the use of force will probably be necessary to neutralize transnational armed groups that indulge in terrorism , jihadism and drug and arms trafficking , and to restore @entity1 's territorial integrity			0
" to stabilize @entity1 , the government will have to agree with the @entity167 politicians to tackle the influx of arms and combatants between a @entity171 still struggling after the fall of ( @entity174 ) @entity173 and northern @entity1 through southern @entity167 , " said @entity122			0
" minimal and sustainable security in northern @entity1 can not be re-established without the clear involvement of the @entity167 political and military authorities			2
this is not something the @entity1 army and @entity4 forces will be able to tackle themselves			0
