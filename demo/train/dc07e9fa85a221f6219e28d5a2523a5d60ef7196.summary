-- the bloodied bodies lay stuffed and tangled in the back of a pickup like garbage			0
men lifted the bodies one by one and hurled from them from a bridge into a river below as cursing filled the air			2
" brother of a whore ! " they shouted as the corpses splashed and the water ran red			0
" animals ! " " dogs ! " at one point , a voice asks mockingly , " this is a soldier ? " report : @entity22 army stretched amid uprising this scene , said to have been shot in @entity22 , surfaced in a video on @entity26 , where images of anti-government ferment and violence have emerged consistently since unrest started in the nation in mid-march			1
@entity0 could not verify the authenticity of the video , but it illustrates the hostility of the nearly five - month - old conflict across @entity22 between regime forces and anti-government protesters			1
it is not clear who the victims were			0
were they among the 1,600 civilians or 370 security forces slain in the unrest ? the posting on the video says the bodies are anti-government forces being dumped by thugs loyal to president @entity48			1
@entity22 state tv has aired the video , saying that the bodies are being dumped by anti-government protesters			1
a banner said the incident took place in @entity53 over the @entity54			2
@entity55 , a @entity22 activist , said activists doubt the incident could have happened at the @entity53 location because the river is dry at this time of year			1
but one prominent anti-government activist , who asked not to be named because of the dangers that could arise from the release of the information , told @entity0 the state tv account was correct			1
the bodies are those of @entity22 secret police killed by @entity22 fighters from @entity68 who have joined the anti-government fight , said the activist , who gets information about the goings - on in @entity22 from an extensive network of informants			1
that same activist stressed that the antagonists are not representative of the protest movement			0
violent fringe elements have appeared during the @entity22 tumult			1
one study last month from the @entity81 said some anti-government elements have taken up arms			0
however , that report said , " the vast majority of casualties have been peaceful protesters , and the vast majority of the violence has been perpetrated by the security services			0
" the activist said the emergence of this video is a double - edged sword for protesters			0
on the one hand , the peaceful demonstrators need to become aware of the existence of fringe elements , he said			0
this would encourage more people to reject both the regime and these types of attacks and maintain the aims of peaceful protest , he said			0
at the same time , he added , the incident gives credence to the @entity22 government 's assertion that it is targeting " armed gangs			2
" such violence , he said , could cause the international community to hesitate in continuing its mounting pressure against the @entity22 regime .			2
