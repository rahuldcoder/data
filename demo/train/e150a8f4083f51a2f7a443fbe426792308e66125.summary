@entity0 -- one year after a video surfaced showing government contractors using hedge clippers to cuts limbs off anesthetized goats -- an effort to replicate wartime injuries -- the @entity9 says it is looking for training that does not use live animals			1
in a report released friday , the @entity9 cleared its members of any wrongdoing , saying the training is required by the @entity15 and that @entity9 participants did not violate any law , regulation or standard of conduct			1
but it said the contractor was cited for violating the @entity22			0
coast guard vice adm. @entity23 , who investigated the matter , ordered the agency to look for training methods that " reduce and / or eliminate the role of live animals			2
" " while no misconduct was committed by @entity9 personnel , the controversial nature of ( the program ) demands the service continue to closely scrutinize its policies , " @entity23 wrote			1
in the meantime , a @entity9 spokesman acknowledged , the training program will continue			1
the so - called " @entity40 " session that gave rise to the controversy occurred march 3 , 2012 -- the last day of a five - day course for non-medical military personnel who might face life - threatening situations			0
thirty - two @entity9 members -- 29 of whom were being deployed to @entity45 and the @entity46 -- participated at an outdoor site in @entity48 , @entity49			1
instructors with @entity50 , a federal contractor , anesthetized and intentionally injured the goats so the students could assess and treat combat - like injuries , the @entity9 said			1
during the first phase of the training , the group was divided into teams of four to six students , and instructors placed anesthetized goats -- which they referred to as " patients " -- on tables			1
the instructors " had the students turn their backs to the table while the instructor inflicted trauma to the animal			2
" students then turned , assessed the injuries , and treated the animals			0
during the second phase , instructors " inflicted combat - like injuries to the animals with a shotgun , pistol , ax , and scalpel , " @entity23 's report says			0
the injured animals were laid out alongside a road to simulate an attack with an improvised explosive or enemy firefight , the report says			0
teams ran into the simulated hot zone , some administering aid while others secured the scene and simulated returning gunfire			0
at the end of the training , the goats were euthanized			2
the number of goats was not disclosed			0
a participant videotaped some of the training , leaking the video to the @entity101 , or @entity101 , an animal rights organization			1
@entity101 posted the video online and filed a complaint with the @entity103 , which oversees the @entity9			2
@entity101 said the training did not reflect battlefield situations , that the goats showed signs of pain and that the students did not show any sense of urgency in treating the animals			1
it also said an instructor cheerfully whistled while dismembering an animal as @entity9 members made jokes			1
@entity23 's report concluded @entity9 members behaved properly			1
" before the training started , both a @entity119 instructor and a @entity9 chief petty officer encouraged students to make reports of any unprofessional behavior , " the report says			1
it says many students described the training as professional , some calling it the best medical training they had ever received			0
" however , one student opined that instructors and students were too lighthearted during training , " the report says			2
but another student said the laughter was unconnected to the course			0
" there is nothing in the video to suggest that this type of behavior was prevalent during the training or was motivated by anything other than reaction to a high stress situation , " the report says			2
" when one student inappropriately waved a severed animal leg in the air , a more senior ranking student quickly reprimanded him and the behavior stopped , " the report says			2
one student also said that having only one person administer anesthesia was not sufficient for all of the animals , the report says , noting that the @entity101 video shows one animal moaning			2
based on the video , the @entity157 subsequently cited @entity119 for violating the @entity22 , the report says			0
asked about the citation on friday , the @entity157 gave @entity1 a warning letter it issued @entity50 on aug. 8 , 2012 , saying the department has evidence the contractor violated a regulation governing proper anesthesia for animals			0
@entity166 did not immediately return a @entity1 request for comment			0
but @entity170 @entity169 , a spokesman for the @entity157 's @entity171 , said , " we conducted a follow - up inspection and determined the noncompliance items had been addressed			0
" a @entity101 official decried the @entity9 report			1
" basically , this report says that all of the disturbing allegations that @entity101 made are true , but that the @entity9 is n't accepting responsibility for it			1
they all but say that it was the contractor 's fault , " said @entity184 , director of @entity101 's @entity185			0
last september , 11 members of @entity187 signed a letter asking the @entity189 to investigate @entity50 , citing last year 's @entity9 training and a 2011 @entity157 action citing the contractor for " inadequate anesthesia oversight " for at least 50 goats			1
@entity101 said the @entity189 has referred the matter to the @entity15 's inspector general 's office , which could not be reached late friday			0
@entity119 won a $ 1.7 million contact with the @entity200 in 2012 to conduct 24 iterations of @entity40 for 360 @entity203 personnel using pigs , the letter says .			0
