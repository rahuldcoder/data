@entity0 and @entity1 are back on the campaign trail			1
@entity0 was in @entity3 on thursday stumping for @entity6 @entity5 while @entity7 flew to @entity8 to campaign for @entity10 gubernatorial candidate @entity9			1
the trips come amid intense speculation over how the 2016 presidential ticket might shape up			0
while it 's unlikely @entity0 will run , he 's leaving the door open a tiny crack to a third campaign			1
meanwhile , of course , everyone is watching @entity7 for signs that she might join the race -- and she 's doing little to discourage the attention			1
the 2016 contest is far from a lock			0
but if the race came down to two leaders who have already run for president , would there be any surprises ? luckily , with two figures who have spent so many years in the public view , we have an idea of what a @entity0 - @entity7 match up might look like			1
here are some areas that would be interesting to watch : @entity38 critics have faulted @entity7 for failing as secretary of state to foresee growing tensions between the @entity42 and @entity38			2
as secretary , @entity7 famously offered her @entity38 counterpart a " reset " button meant to show the two countries were looking to cooperate more			2
but president @entity50 's incursion into @entity51 and his support for @entity54 president @entity53 during the country 's bloody civil war , both of which occurred after @entity7 stepped down , have chilled the relationship @entity7 hoped would thaw			1
enter @entity0 , who was mocked after calling @entity38 the @entity42 ' " number one geopolitical foe " during an interview with @entity60 in 2012			2
at the time , @entity7 called his remarks " dated			2
" @entity0 struck back in an interview with @entity63 this summer , calling @entity7 's reset button " one of the most embarrassing incidents in @entity42 foreign policy			1
" @entity67 , a @entity10 strategist who worked on @entity7 's 2008 effort , underlined the former secretary of state 's real world foreign policy experience			1
" as secretary of state , @entity1 has a foreign policy record , " @entity67 said			1
" i 'm not entirely sure what @entity0 has besides campaign positions			2
" what about gaffes ? @entity0 famously made his 2012 effort more difficult with a series of inopportune remarks that @entity10 used to paint him as out - of - touch			1
from the " couple of @entity82 " he said his wife owned , to the 47 percent of @entity42 he said were dependent on government , to his offhand remark that " i like being able to fire people " who provide bad service , @entity0 handed opponents an opening			2
but while promoting her book " @entity92 " this summer , @entity7 made some missteps of her own			2
the former first lady said she and her husband were " dead broke " when they left the @entity97 in 2001			0
earlier this year , she told an audience in @entity99 that she had not driven a car since 1996 because of @entity102 concerns			0
were @entity0 to run again , @entity7 's stumbles might help inoculate him against the same criticism he faced over his wealth during his two previous campaigns			1
a former @entity0 aide suggested @entity0 's more recent campaign trail experience would make him more comfortable on the stump			1
" she 's rusty , " former @entity111 spokesman @entity110 said of @entity7			1
" gov. @entity0 has been through two campaigns at this point			2
he 's been out on the campaign trail campaigning for midterm candidates			0
she certainly would have a steeper learning curve			0
" @entity7 has granted dozens of press interviews and given many speeches to public and private groups			0
but she has n't crisscrossed the country campaigning with midterm candidates like @entity0			1
that potential advantage could extend to presidential debates			0
@entity0 shot up in the polls after surprising president @entity126 in their first one - on - one debate in october 2012			1
@entity7 has n't gone through that grueling experience since 2008			0
but @entity60 senior political analyst and national journal editorial director @entity131 said @entity0 would be hard pressed to shake the sense of some voters that he does n't understand them			0
" it was really about him embodying the guy who came to your town and shut down the plant			0
i still think that 's there , " @entity131 said			0
" i do n't think @entity0 gets away from that no matter who he 's running against			1
" women in 2008 , @entity7 's presidential campaign sparked tremendous enthusiasm among women voters and put 18 million cracks in the " highest , hardest glass ceiling			1
" she continued her work on issues affecting women and girls at the @entity154 and through her family 's philanthropic arm , the @entity155			1
@entity0 struggled with women voters in 2012 , with 55 % of women supporting president @entity126			2
@entity7 has the potential to grow @entity10 support even among women who supported @entity0 during the last election			1
" she is just extremely well positioned to exploit the demographic vulnerabilities of the @entity164 , " @entity131 said , pointing to @entity164 support for the @entity166 case on employer funded birth control and state level funding cuts for @entity171 programs			0
@entity7 supporters point to her focus in public remarks on pocketbook issues such as equal pay and affordable childcare , saying those issues have already resonated with voters			2
" i fail to see anyone in the @entity164 that has either articulated an alternative or that embodies remotely the same amount of excitement and enthusiasm as @entity1 does today , " @entity67 said			0
message recent public remarks from @entity0 and @entity7 give a few hints at how they might try to appeal to voters should they launch a presidential campaign			1
@entity7 has spoken about creating more opportunities for women and girls at a variety of public and political events , in what some analysts have heard as a possible campaign theme			2
" do n't let anyone dismiss what you 're doing here today as women 's work , " @entity7 told an audience at the @entity202 in @entity203 in september			1
" we 're here proud @entity10 women and proud @entity10 men , to stand up not just ourselves , not just for women but for all our people - for our families , our communities and our country			0
" @entity7 also would enjoy the support and enthusiasm of a handful of outside political groups like the super @entity219 that have sprouted up purely to fuel her potential candidacy			0
as for @entity0 , his message could be something like : " having second ( or third ) thoughts now ? " on that theme , he told an audience in @entity227 this week that president @entity126 should have taken the terrorist group @entity228 more seriously earlier			0
" for the president to say , ' @entity229 , we underestimated @entity228 ' suggests he was n't looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him , " @entity0 said			0
" i guess he was busy doing other things -- vacations , golf , fundraising			0
he just has n't done the job he promised to do			0
" a @entity60 / @entity240 poll from july found that 53 % of @entity42 would support @entity0 over president @entity126 if they could vote again today			0
( in a hypothetical match up with @entity7 , however , 55 % would have supported @entity7 , with 42 % for @entity0			1
) @entity0 supporters argue the former candidate seemed prescient on a variety of issues			2
" he brings a proven track record of being forward thinking and having the ability to recognize problems and threats before they become a disaster , " @entity110 , his former spokesman , said			0
but while the upcoming presidential election may center on change , both @entity7 and @entity0 could find themselves talking a lot about their experience			1
" you 've also got to have people who 've actually run something , " @entity0 told @entity257 in september			0
" i do n't think @entity1 has that experience			0

@entity0 and @entity1 both spent thursday campaigning
@entity0 has left the door open to another presidential bid
foreign policy and women 's issues could dominate a @entity7 - @entity0 race
