-- since the summer of 2010 , @entity1 has become a pop culture fixture , a self - appointed champion of free speech , the suspect in a @entity7 sex crimes investigation and a man who says he 's keeping afloat a financially strapped web operation that has mightily ticked off the @entity11 government			1
but one thing is certain : @entity1 is not going away , no matter what happens in the ongoing legal case against him			1
@entity1 lost his appeal before @entity18 's @entity17 on wednesday , taking him another step closer to extradition to @entity7 for questioning on sexual abuse accusations filed against him in august 2010			1
he 's been living in @entity23 under house arrest related to the case and has failed several times in recent months to convince magistrates and the court of appeal that a warrant for his arrest is invalid			2
@entity1 has repeatedly stressed that he 's innocent			1
his lawyers have vowed to take the fight all the way to the @entity34 if necessary			2
though @entity1 is a household name now , little was known about him before july 25 , 2010 , when he dominated breaking international headlines when his site @entity38 published a trove of classified @entity11 documents about the @entity42 war			1
until then , @entity1 had done few interviews and had kept a low profile			1
one exception , however , was a @entity47 talk conducted just days earlier in which he described his upbringing as constantly uprooted , and said that his parents were in the movie business and on the run from a cult			1
the audience at the @entity47 event seemed rapt			2
they laughed and clapped at his comments			2
when @entity1 founded @entity38 in 2006 , the site built a relatively small but steady following among investigative journalists			1
@entity38 cut its teeth in its early years leaking information that exposed corruption in @entity63 and information about the @entity66 detention facility in @entity67 , and his talk at @entity47 concentrated mostly on those experiences			2
even after more than a year and a half of drama involving @entity1 and @entity38 , some still consider @entity1 a journalist			1
for the past year , he has been living in a remote manor house called @entity75 , north of @entity76			2
the home belongs to @entity78 , a former @entity18 soldier and journalist who runs a popular @entity76 gathering spot for reporters			2
@entity1 was a kind of nomad before his house arrest , numerous accounts and interviews he 's given suggest			1
@entity86 has provided shelter for him from most media			2
he 's given very few interviews in the past year , except for an hour - long talk with " @entity91 " from the estate that aired on january 30 , 2011			0
over the months since his initial arrest in the @entity7 case , @entity1 has repeatedly said that he 's innocent of the allegations and that they are a ruse to get him for leaking the classified @entity11 documents			1
in 2010 , @entity38 posted online 391,832 classified documents on the @entity101 war and more than 90,000 classified documents on the @entity42 war			0
@entity38 has also released about a quarter - million diplomatic cables -- communication between the @entity106 and diplomatic outposts around the globe			0
@entity1 gave an interview to @entity111 's @entity110 in 2010 , explaining the decision to publish the @entity42 war documents			1
" this material shined a light on the everyday brutality and squalor of war , " he said			0
@entity1 continued in interviews over several months with @entity120 , @entity0 and other media outlets to insist that leaking the classified documents served a greater public good			1
instant fame with the @entity42 war leak , @entity1 became a household name nearly overnight			1
every news outlet in the world was reporting the story and flashing pictures of his snow - white hair , skinny ties and sardonic smile			0
some said he was a cheerleader of transparency and a defender of the public 's right to know			0
others said he was a foe of the @entity11 and its allies , and had endangered confidential intelligence informants whose names appeared in an initial batch of the @entity38 documents			0
@entity11 rep. @entity146 , @entity148 - @entity147 , called @entity1 an " enemy combatant			1
" when @entity1 was arrested in relation to the sexual assault allegations , then - @entity11 defense secretary @entity150 told reporters , " it sounds like good news to me			1
" yet @entity1 stepped further into the fray			1
in late 2010 , @entity1 said that secretary of state @entity157 " should resign " when responding to a question by @entity120 concerning the diplomatic cable dump			1
at the same time , @entity1 's influence and star power grew			1
@entity120 's readers voted him @entity163 for 2010			0
despite the ongoing sex crimes case , for which he was temporarily jailed ( a detention that " @entity167 " spoofed ) , @entity1 insisted that @entity38 was still operating			1
on september 2 , 2011 , @entity38 released its entire archive of the diplomatic cables -- 251,287 unredacted documents			0
an unauthorized biography of @entity1 , which he has fiercely criticized , was also released in september			1
according to several reports , @entity18 newspaper @entity174 published what it said were portions of the book			0
in one section , @entity1 is quoted as saying , " i did not rape those women			1
" on november 28 , @entity1 addressed journalists at a @entity182 in @entity183 via a video link from @entity23			1
for at least 30 minutes , he went on a rant criticizing @entity186 , mainstream media , banks and others , while accepting an award from a noted journalism group , the @entity192 of @entity193			1
he said that a federal grand jury in @entity186 was investigating @entity38 and that people and companies around the world were coerced to testify against the group			0
he accused banks of blockading @entity38 , said that journalists have become ladder climbers and must be held to greater account , and said there was a " new mccarthyism " in the @entity11			0
also last year , @entity1 won the 2011 @entity205 , and a @entity207 parliamentarian nominated him for the @entity208			1
the latest proof that @entity1 is certifiably pop is news that he voiced his own character for the 500th episode of " @entity214 " which aired earlier this year			1
he recorded the spot last summer			0
in march , @entity1 hosted a new talk show on english - language @entity218 television			1
called " @entity221 , " it features him interviewing " key political players , thinkers and revolutionaries			0
" from hacking to @entity225 while @entity1 's public persona grows stronger , his mother , @entity226 , said that his ordeal is taking a toll on her family			1
she told @entity231 this week that her son 's battle against extradition to @entity7 is a " political frame - up			1
" she also said her cell phone is being monitored , according to the @entity237			0
yet @entity226 has been her son 's biggest defender			0
she has in the past described him as " highly intelligent			0
" he was just 16 when she bought him a @entity241 computer in 1987			0
@entity1 attached a modem to his computer and began his journey into the new computer era			1
" it 's like chess , " he told @entity247 magazine			0
" chess is very austere in that you do n't have many rules , there is no randomness and the problem is very hard			0
" though his mother raised him without any religious influence , she sensed that from a tender age , her son was led by a strong desire to do what he perceived as just			1
" he was a lovely boy , very sensitive , good with animals , quiet and has a wicked sense of humor , " she 's told the @entity266 , @entity193 , @entity267 @entity1 studied mathematics and physics at the @entity270			1
in interviews , @entity1 speaks in baritone			1
his pace is measured , and he seems to choose words carefully			0
he can be charming yet cagey about his private life and is rarely shaken by discussions of even the most controversial revelations on @entity38			0
he 's the kind of person who , he says , can hack into the most sophisticated computer system			0
but he can forget to show up for an interview or cancel at the last minute			0
when he talks , he displays an astonishing breadth of interests : from computers to literature to his travels in @entity287			0
@entity1 's fascination with hacking grew when he was a teen			2
he taught himself computer encryption and security			0
he says he once set up an encryption puzzle based on the manipulation of prime numbers			0
a june 2010 @entity247 article describes how @entity1 hacked into the master terminal of the telecom company @entity297 in 1991			2
the profile also says that @entity1 married and had a child when he was 18 , but the relationship fell apart and his wife left him with their infant son			2
the young hacker eventually turned away from network flaws and focused on what he perceived as wrongdoings of governments			0
an activist , journalist or both ? this statement appeared in 2007 on the blog @entity313 , which @entity1 is believed to have created			2
" the whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy opponent , but try as i may i can not escape the sound of suffering			0
perhaps as an old man i will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance			0
but not now ; men in their prime , if they have convictions are tasked to act on them			0
" among the myriad topics addressed on the blog , @entity1 discusses mathematics versus philosophy , the death of author @entity333 , censorship in @entity335 and the corporation as a nation state			2
driven by the conviction of an activist and the curiosity of a journalist , @entity1 founded @entity38 in 2006			2
he slept little and sometimes forgot to eat			0
he hired staff and enlisted the help of volunteers			0
@entity345 , a longtime volunteer and spokesman for @entity38 , was considered to be @entity1 's closest collaborator			2
he quit @entity38 and told @entity0 that @entity1 's personality was distracting from the group 's original mission : to publish small leaks , not just huge , splashy ones like the @entity352			2
@entity345 went on to publish a tell - all book about the inner workings of @entity38			0
he wrote that @entity1 is a " paranoid , power - hungry , megalomaniac			2

@entity1 is facing extradition to @entity7 on allegations of sex crimes
@entity1 said he was raised by parents in theater business in @entity193
his mother , @entity364 , has been one of his fiercest defenders
