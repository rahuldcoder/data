" i had to actually ... i shut it off			0
i asked them to stop			0
and there were three or four more pictures that they wanted to show me , and i just ... i.			0
. i could n't , " she told @entity0 , her voice trailing off			2
publicly , @entity67 investigators said in january 2012 , that they had identified @entity2 's blood in the basement , describing it as " more ... than a small cut would produce			1
" according to @entity2 's mother , she is making the disclosures in frustration that her daughter has n't been found , and she wants three adults who were in the home when @entity2 vanished -- the child 's father , his girlfriend , and his sister -- arrested			1

' that statement stands , " @entity67 spokesman @entity108 recently told @entity0			2

" we understand her frustration			0
@entity8 has a right to be frustrated			0
she is @entity130 's mom			0
at times during the past 21 months we 're frustrated too , " @entity121 explained , " but we remember who we are working for			0
and we 're working for @entity2			2
and that reinvigorates the investigative team			0
" organized by supporters of @entity2 's mother , an online petition drive has been mounted urging @entity3 attorney general @entity138 to arrest @entity2 's father , his sister , and girlfriend in connection with the toddler 's disappearance			1
but deputy attorney general @entity145 said that is not how investigations are conducted			0
