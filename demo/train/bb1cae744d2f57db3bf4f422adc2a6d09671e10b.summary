this ultra-illustrative , chronological listing of posts , photos , shared links , check - ins , and more is a radically different arrangement than the @entity1 profile you 've been used to			1
and now that your life can be exposed for everyone to see -- and scrutinize -- you may be interested in curating the new interface			0

it does n't take long to master the new interface , and it 's an important exercise for anyone interested in , well , reputation management			0
privacy 101 : how to hide things you probably already know that @entity1 has controversial positions on privacy			1
so you may now find that some things included on your timeline are best kept from curious eyes			1

to hide a @entity14 element , click the pencil icon at the top of the offending post , then choose " @entity45 from @entity46			1
and please note : any privacy settings you 've already set still apply to the timeline interface			0

click the arrow next to your home button at the top of the screen to access your @entity65			2
scroll down to " @entity66 , " then choose " @entity67			0
" now click " @entity68 " -- all 2			0
tell your life story : how to add past events privacy , schmivacy ! perhaps , you want the whole world to know the day you were born , the first time you rode a bike , and that debate club award you got in high school			0
these events are n't listed on your timeline , but they can be			0
to add a status update , photo , place check - in , or life event to your timeline , simply hover the mouse over the line in the center of the page until it turns into a plus sign , and reveals the option to add one of those four types of posts			2
now , @entity1 can accurately reflect your entire life -- and not just the events that occurred after you first signed on			2
add some individuality : how to customize your timeline there are a number of ways you can personalize your timeline so it highlights the posts , pictures and events you cherish most			2
first , you can add a cover to your timeline			0
toward the top of your profile , above the buttons where it says " @entity106 , " you should see " add a cover			2
" once you click that , you can select an image from your photos , or opt to upload a new image			0
once it loads , you can adjust the positioning of your cover image			0
if you set a cover photo and then decide it 's not as great as you first thought , just hover your mouse over the image , and a " @entity120 " option menu will pop up , letting you reposition the image or select a new one			0
for photo albums you 've created , you can change the primary photo that displays ( you could do this before , but now the process is different )			0
simply click the pencil icon in the upper corner of the album post , and select " @entity129			1
" you can also choose to highlight a post -- expanding it from a small , half - page - size post to a wide - screen version â € ” by selecting the star icon in the post 's upper - right corner			1
conversely , you can click the star on a maximized featured post to make it normal again			2
appearances matter : how to check out your timeline from different angles if you decide to make a number of posts and photos private or hidden from your timeline , you can still get the full , complete view of your @entity1 action history			1
on your timeline , click " @entity149			1
" there you 'll find posts and information you need to review before it publishes to your profile , as well as a complete look at your interactions on @entity1			1

you can choose to filter what you see by clicking the " all " dropdown menu at the top			2
you can choose to see only your posts , posts by others , posts from specific @entity1 apps ( " hmm , let 's look at my past @entity168 accomplishments " ) , photos and more			1
like before , you can also check how others view your profile			0
next to " @entity149 " is a cog icon			1
click that , and you can choose " @entity180 ... " and either enter a friend 's name or click the " public " link to see how your profile looks to strangers			1
information overload : how to organize friends and filter updates now that your timeline is all straightened out , you might as well do some house cleaning on what shows up in your @entity187			1
when you add a friend or follow someone 's public updates , @entity1 automatically sets the level of posts you see to " @entity194			1
" you can change this by going to that profile , and clicking the " subscribed " button			0
you can change it to " only important " updates or " all updates , " and you can also filter what types of posts you 're interested in seeing : things like life events , status updates , or photos			0

the average @entity1 user has 130 friends , but i 'd venture to say that most of you reading this have far more than that , so this will help streamline your @entity1 experience			1
one last thing : if you 're one of those people who 's still into " poking " your friends , you can still do that			2
