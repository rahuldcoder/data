-- less than three months ago , the @entity1 handed down eagerly awaited rulings on same - sex marriage , voting rights and affirmative action			1
next month , the court will begin its new term and likely deal with controversial issues such as abortion , campaign finance reform and the separation of church and state			0
when the court is in the middle of a term , it is easy to focus on hard legal questions , the legal views of individual justices and the consequences of landmark decisions			2
now is a good time , when the court is in recess , to take a step back and look at the institution itself			0
a lifetime is too long first , our @entity1 justices are the only judges in the world who sit on a country 's highest court and have life tenure			1
because the president nominates the justices and the @entity37 confirms them , the @entity34 people do not elect the justices and can not vote them out of office			2
in light of the crucial role the court plays across the spectrum of social , legal and political issues , the question of how long our justices serve should be re-examined			1
@entity1 justices often serve more than 25 years and beyond the time they are still fit to perform their duties			1
for example , according to renown author @entity53 , both justices @entity50 and @entity52 remained on the bench well after their skills had significantly diminished beyond the point of competence			1
the usual justification for life tenure is that the justices need to be independent of the other branches of the government to adequately perform their duties			1
this need for independence is real and compelling , but there are other ways to achieve that goal			0
other countries use fixed terms , retirement ages or a combination of the two to achieve the necessary independence			0
there simply is no persuasive reason to allow governmental officials who have virtually unreviewable power to hold their offices for life			2
few witnesses to history the second aspect of our @entity1 that needs to be changed is the lack of television coverage of oral arguments and decision announcements			1
what a shame that during the last week of june when the court handed down and read from the bench numerous important decisions -- including the overturning of the @entity93 and the formula in @entity95 of the @entity96 -- the @entity34 people had to hear the news indirectly from media personalities instead of the justices			2
similarly in 2012 , when the court held three days of oral arguments on the president 's most important piece of legislation , the @entity105 , the public should have been able to witness those arguments just like the lucky few who happened to be in the courtroom			0
moreover , it is close to a tragedy that future generations will have absolutely no video record of the court 's arguments or decisions in these landmark cases			0
it would be an invaluable learning tool if young @entity34 today could see the oral arguments in @entity120 or @entity121			0
more than 30 state supreme courts allow cameras in the courtroom with great success			1
@entity1 justices @entity126 and @entity128 have suggested that the presence of television would lead to grandstanding by lawyers and maybe even the justices themselves , but the experiences in state courts demonstrate such concerns are greatly exaggerated			1
when @entity139 was considering placing cameras in the courtroom , justice @entity138 conducted a survey and found that " state supreme courts have blazed a significant technological trail			1
... the public 's response , according to those state supreme courts that provide those video broadcasts , border [ ed ] on the exuberant			0
[ @entity146 ] o state that currently provides video of its oral arguments cites grandstanding as a problem			0
" @entity139 has joined the majority of states that allow cameras in their courtrooms			1
there is simply no good reason for the @entity1 not to do exactly the same thing			2
a joke of a job interview finally , we have to do something about the national farce that is our @entity1 nomination process			1
the sad spectacle of senators asking questions drafted by their staffs and then allowing the nominees to duck them should give way to serious conversations about the nominees ' views so that the @entity34 people can participate more fully in the confirmation process			0
as almost everyone now knows , the justices have enormous discretion to decide cases in accordance with their personal and political value systems			0
the differences between justices @entity186 and @entity188 on most constitutional questions have nothing to do with legal interpretation and everything to do with their different backgrounds , experiences and values			0
the @entity37 should do a much better job requiring nominees to answer hard questions about those values and experiences before the nominees are allowed to sit on the highest court in the land			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : life tenure allows justices to serve past the point of competence
@entity206 : @entity1 should follow lead of many states and allow cameras in courtroom
the @entity1 nomination process is a farce , he adds
