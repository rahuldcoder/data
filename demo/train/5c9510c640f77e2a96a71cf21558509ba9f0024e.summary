@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration is leaving the door open to a possible expansion of the @entity7 military mission in @entity8 , with the possibility of targeting not just @entity10 but also @entity12 - affiliated @entity11			1
while there are no active @entity7 military plans for airstrikes against @entity11 targets in @entity8 , neither the @entity18 nor the @entity19 has rejected that idea as a possible future option , a senior @entity7 official tells @entity1			1
" nothing is off the table completely , " the official said			1
the possibility of strikes against @entity11 -- the @entity12 affiliate in @entity8 -- was first reported by the @entity26			1
senior @entity7 military officials are making it clear the @entity18 is not anxious to undertake such strikes , knowing it would legitimately be seen as so - called mission creep , the official said			1
when asked by @entity1 's @entity32 , @entity19 press secretary @entity31 seemed to leave the door open , however			2
" the @entity7 remains concerned about all threats emanating from @entity8 , including the threat that 's posed from by the @entity11			1
that 's driven by the fact that ... the @entity11 has been public in threatening the @entity38 , " @entity31 said tuesday			2
" but what we will continue to do here in the @entity7 is to work closely with our coalition partners to take strikes in @entity8 that are focused principally on denying a safe haven to those extremists and organizations that are seeking to do harm to the @entity7 or our allies			2
" @entity51 wrote memo to @entity19 criticizing @entity8 strategy striking @entity11 would have the goal of pushing back its advances against moderate @entity8 rebels who the @entity7 is backing in the fight against @entity10			1
the @entity18 has repeatedly said it sees the @entity7 military priority as striking @entity10 in both @entity8 and @entity59 with the goal of ensuring @entity59 does not fall to @entity10 control			1
but getting @entity8 opposition into fighting shape to challenge @entity10 has been a slow and complicated process due to the need to verify the security credentials of @entity8 fighters going through the program			0
more than four months after announcing an effort to train and equip the moderate @entity8 opposition , the @entity7 military has yet to vet a single @entity8 rebel to fight @entity10 on the ground			1
" there 's progress in setting up curriculum , there 's progress in getting the sites ready , there 's progress in getting trainers contributed to the effort -- not just from the @entity7 but from other nations , " @entity18 spokesman rear adm. @entity75 said tuesday			2
" but the vetting progress has not begun yet			0
@entity75 added that the program " has not been completely codified , " but did not go into detail on how or when that process might unfold			0
the idea of mounting a train - and - equip program for the moderate opposition was first floated over a year ago , in the aftermath of revelations that the @entity97 regime used chemical weapons against @entity8 civilians			0
but it was not until june of this year , when the terror group @entity10 started making significant territorial gains in @entity59 , that the @entity3 administration backed the plan , asking @entity105 for $ 500 million to " train and equip appropriately vetted elements of the moderate @entity8 armed opposition			0
" opinion : what would @entity110 do ? prior to that , the @entity7 had been providing nonlethal material and light weapons to the moderate opposition			0
the effort is part of a $ 1.5 billion initiative the @entity7 is undertaking with a number of regional partners			0
@entity75 also told reporters that the @entity7 military is making significant progress in its overall efforts to degrade and destroy @entity10			1
in particular , @entity75 said , the @entity59 army is making meaningful territorial gains with help from @entity7 advisers , and @entity7 - led efforts are helping disrupt the group 's revenue and degraded its ability to maneuver , communicate and operate inside @entity59			2
" nobody is saying that it 's over			0
there 's a long way to go here , " @entity75 cautioned			0
" but they 've definitely felt ... the full weight of the pressure that 's being put on them			0

an expanded mission could target not just @entity10 but also @entity12 - affiliated @entity11
" nothing is off the table completely , " a senior @entity7 official tells @entity1
military officials make it clear the @entity18 is not anxious to undertake such strikes
such expansion likely would be seen as " mission creep "
