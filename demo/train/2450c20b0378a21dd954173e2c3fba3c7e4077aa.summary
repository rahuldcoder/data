in the latest volley in the ongoing battle over @entity4 voter lists , the @entity0 has sent a letter stating it will take legal action against the state , citing violations of voting rights laws			1
" because the @entity12 has indicated its unwillingness to comply with these requirements , i have authorized the initiation of an enforcement action against @entity4 in federal court , " said @entity10 , assistant attorney general for civil rights			0
read the @entity0 's letter the lawsuit comes after the department began questioning the legality of the state 's so - called voter purge program , which would remove names from @entity4 's voter rolls months before the 2012 presidential election , when @entity4 will play a key role as a battleground state with a large chunk of electoral votes			1
@entity4 's move to eliminate non-eligible voters from its lists began after the state 's @entity35 governor , @entity34 , pressed the state to identify non- @entity39 citizens who had registered to vote illegally			1
using information from @entity4 's @entity41 , the state identified more than 100,000 names of non-eligible voters that could potentially be on the lists illegally			1
critics say the plan unfairly targets minorities and paint it as an attempt to dissuade typically @entity52 voters from going to the polls			1
while the @entity0 notes that states can legally remove non-eligible voters from their lists , the letter monday argues that the @entity4 program does not comply with legal standards , has " critical imperfections , which lead to errors that harm and confuse eligible voters			1
" the letter states that the @entity4 program improperly uses the information collected from old driver 's license applications			2
" the information is often going to be outdated , as a number of persons will subsequently have become citizens and lawfully registered to vote , " @entity10 wrote			0
it also suggests that the removal process has been going on during a " 90 - day quiet period " prior to the august 14 primary election			0
" please immediately cease this unlawful conduct , " the letter states			0
@entity4 gov. @entity34 , a @entity35 , told @entity76 monday that the state plans to sue the @entity78 to get access to the federal citizenship database so that it can better determine who is voting legally			2
" i have a job to do to defend legitimate voters of our state , " @entity34 said on @entity76			0
three of the state 's largest counties -- @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 -- agreed last week to end the removal of the names			0
the legal counsel for @entity4 's county election officials recommended halting the purge of names until the state responded to the federal government 's legal assessment			2
@entity4 's @entity35 - appointed secretary of state , @entity100 , has previously defended the state 's practice , slamming the federal government for restricting access to federal citizenship databases and saying such a constraint was illegal			0
" it is an unfortunate but now undeniable fact that @entity4 's voter rolls include individuals who are not citizens of the @entity39			1
the @entity4 @entity115 has a solemn obligation to ensure the integrity of elections in this state , " @entity100 wrote in the letter last week addressed to @entity113 , head of the @entity0 's elections unit .			0
