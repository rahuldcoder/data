-- it had always been a day destined for thrills and spills , but sunday 's denouement to the @entity6 league season ended in chaos as a vital relegation match between @entity9 and @entity10 at the @entity11 , @entity12 , was halted after a barrier collapsed , injuring almost 60 people			1
@entity9 fans surged forwards when @entity17 scored a 12th minute goal , in a game the home team had to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation			1
but a metal fence collapsed under the weight of people , sparking scenes of chaos as the match was suspended			2
fans were ferried from the scene on stretchers as the authorities assessed the damage , tended to the wounded and made emergency repairs to the broken fence			1
ten people were taken to hospital whilst another 48 people were treated for minor injuries at the scene			0
" it had been many years since i had been to @entity11 , " @entity10 coach @entity40 said after the game , according to @entity42			1
" i was surprised by the state of the stadium in 2014 and the politicians need to do something to have a stadium that belongs to 2014 and @entity9			1
" the match was restarted 35 minutes later , from the 11th minute			0
almost immediately @entity9 went 2 - 0 up against a @entity10 side already relegated			1
but the delay had caused a dilemma			0
the matches involving teams fighting relegation were due to start and finish at the same time so not to give one team an advantage over the others			0
controversially , it was decided to extend half time at the other games so that the second halves across @entity6 would kick off at the same time			2
@entity9 went on to win the match 2 - 1 , but it was n't enough			1
@entity66 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity67 meant that the result in @entity12 was immaterial			0
" it is a very sad day personally and professionally for me , " @entity9 boss @entity69 told @entity42 after the game			2
" i am very sorry that the team has been relegated			0
i am sorry for the situation we have come to and i hope @entity9 will be back in the @entity74 as soon as possible			2
" despite winning , we did n't have it in our own hands and the results did n't go our way			0
at this time any analysis of the game and the situation has no meaning for me given the moment in which the team , the club and everyone is experiencing			0
" elsewhere , @entity87 ensured they will be in @entity6 's top tier next season after @entity91 international @entity90 scored twice to beat @entity92 2 - 1			1
@entity94 's 0 - 0 draw against @entity95 was enough to ensure their safety too			0
but the enduring image from the final day of the @entity6 season will be of a catastrophe narrowly avoided .			2

@entity6 league finale *overshadowed* by stadium collapse

nearly 60 fans injured , but none seriously
