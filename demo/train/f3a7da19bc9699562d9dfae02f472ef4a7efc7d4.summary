enjoying the first bite of a fresh juicy plum may well be described as a simple pleasure , but the process from farm to mouth involves careful planning and precision			2
in @entity11 , the journey for many plums starts in the picturesque @entity12 in the @entity13 , where the climate is well - suited for growing the stone fruit			1
" we 've got a slightly cooler summer than the rest of the area , " explains @entity16 marketing manager at @entity17			0
" plums prefer cooler temperatures during the growing area of the plum , from after flowering until harvesting			1
so the time of the fruit on the tree is more , compared to other areas			0
" and it is plums that are the most important stone fruit to the @entity11 economy , making up a bigger share of both production and exports than peaches and apricots			1
according to horticultural experts @entity41 , almost 16 million cartons of stone fruit were exported during the 2013 - 14 season , of which 10.5 million cartons were plums			1
tight timing @entity16 and his team are focused on getting the stone fruit out of the orchard , into the pack shed and off to market -- largely in @entity51 and the @entity52			0
in fact , approximately 70 % of plums grown in @entity11 are destined to be sold overseas			1
" they must be shipped for four weeks , " explains technical and quality assistant @entity55			0
" by the time they reach the market they [ must be ] completely edible and sweet			0
" @entity61 are a red variety with yellow flesh , but @entity16 and @entity55 must pack the stone fruit before they are fully ripe and colored			0
" if you do n't pick it at the right maturity , then it does n't get overseas at the right eating quality , " explains fruit farmer @entity66			2
" we do [ check ] pressures to see that the maturity is right , " he continues			0
" as soon as we do that it will go into the cold room for a day to cool it down after we pick it ... then we take it out and pack it and we ship it			2
" according to the @entity82 , plum production in @entity11 has increased from 60,000 tons in 2009/2010 to nearly 80,000 tons in 2013/2014			1
and @entity41 is expecting plum shipments to increase by around 10 % this year			1
but to ensure these forecasts are met , farmers like @entity66 need the right climatic conditions			0
" weather is quite a big factor for the plum industry , " @entity66 explains			2
" if it rains , then we do n't have fruit on the trees or very little and if the weather is too dry or too hot then we 've got smaller fruit ... this year we are seven to 10 days earlier than last year , so the fruit is much smaller than the previous year			1
" meeting standards in order to export fruit , certain criteria need to be met			0
essential for plum producers is the @entity103 food safety certification , which gives shop customers and retailers in 118 countries the ability to trace a product right back to the farm			0
fruit producers must also comply with standards set by the @entity112 of @entity11 , which was established by the @entity11 fruit industry to make sure labor practices in orchards and pack sheds are ethical			1
" they 've got eight minimum steps ; forced labor , child labor , hours working of the laborers , " explains @entity66			0
" all that stuff needs to be in place on the farm and that 's quite a lot of paperwork that needs to be done			0
" but , for a company focused on selling abroad , the challenges do n't stop with paperwork			0
as the @entity11 market for stone fruit grows by 100 per cent year on year , the growers and producers need to adapt to the market			1
" the infrastructure in @entity11 is very limited at the moment , " says @entity16			1
" not a lot of cold storages around in @entity11			2
there are only a certain amount of plum varieties we are capable of exporting into @entity11 , but definitely @entity11 is a growing market			1
" but @entity16 is also clear that the current established markets will continue to be important for the @entity11 stone fruit industry			2
" our advantage is that we are almost 10 days quicker on transit time from @entity11 into the @entity51 markets so in general in the stone fruit season in we produce about 60/70 % of the out of season stone fruit production for @entity51 , " he explains			1
" we need to be better than our competition , which is mainly @entity152 , so we just need to outperform them and deliver better quality for the markets			0
