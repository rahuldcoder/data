-- the @entity2 will set a limit on the amount of the chemical perchlorate , as well as other " toxic contaminants , " in drinking water , it announced wednesday			1
the national regulation on perchlorate will reverse a 2008 decision made by president @entity13 's administration , the agency said in a statement			1
it comes after @entity2 administrator @entity16 ordered agency scientists to review " the emerging science of perchlorate			1
" " there 's going to be a lot of scrutiny of the standard because , again , we are looking at but one of several precursors that can affect iodine uptake in the thyroid , " @entity20 told @entity0 's @entity22 correspondent , dr. @entity21			2
" it 's the first time we 've ever regulated a chemical not because of what it does directly to you , but because it has an impact on iodine uptake that might affect your child down the road			0
" @entity39 : chemicals in our environment perchlorate is both a naturally occurring and man - made chemical , according to the @entity2			1
it is used in fireworks , road flares , rocket fuel and may be present in bleach and some fertilizers , the agency said			0
research has indicated that it can impact the thyroid and disrupt the proper development of fetuses and infants			0
some states have already established limits on perchlorate in drinking water , but there has been no national standard			1
however , monitoring data shows more than 4 % of public water systems have detected perchlorate and between 5 and 17 million people may be served drinking water containing it , the @entity2 said			1
the decision was made after considering input from nearly 39,000 public comments , the agency said			0
once the @entity2 proposes a formal rule , it will be subject to the public comment process			2
in addition , the @entity2 is also establishing a drinking water standard on " a group of up to 16 other toxic chemicals that may cause cancer and pose serious risks to human health , " the statement said			1
the chemicals are a group of volatile organic compounds , such as industrial solvents , and include trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene , along with other regulated and some unregulated substances " discharged from industrial operations			2
" the move is part of a @entity94 laid out by @entity20 last year , the agency said			0
the strategy included addressing contaminants as a group so that their presence in drinking water could be addressed " cost - effectively			2
" " today 's action delivers on the promise to strengthen public health protection from contaminants in drinking water , " according to the @entity2			1
" the aim is to find solutions that meet the health and economic needs of communities across the country more effectively than the current approach			0
" @entity20 said in the statement she believes the decision will spark new innovations			0
" as improved standards are developed and put in place , @entity118 's world - leading clean water technology innovators have an opportunity to create cutting edge solutions that will strengthen health protections and spark economic growth			0

the agency will set a national standard for perchlorate in water
an *estimated* 4 % of water systems contain the chemical
the @entity2 will also set regulations on a group of other chemicals
