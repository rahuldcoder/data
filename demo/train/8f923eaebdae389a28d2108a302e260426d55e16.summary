@entity0 , @entity1 -- they are the arteries that keep @entity0 's economy ticking , rattling six million people a day to offices , shops and factories			1
but arriving safe and sound for work after a trip on @entity0 's clogged railways is no mean feat. even after a $ 2 billion upgrade , @entity0 's trains will still have to carry 1.5 times their capacity at peak hours			1
on average , 4,000 people die a year on @entity0 's railways , crushed under trains , electrocuted by overhead power lines or killed as they lean from jam - packed carriages to gasp for air			1
it is perhaps the world 's deadliest commute			2
" everyday it 's a nightmare			2
the train is so crowded that one has to look up at the ceiling to breathe , " said @entity29 , a young student in @entity1 's financial capital			2
at peak hours more than 550 people cram into a carriage built for 200			1
passengers fall to their deaths from moving trains or tumble under the wheels from crowded platforms			2
people hang from coaches , balance precariously on the roofs of carriages or risk a ride on the bumpers between cars as they trundle along three lines and through nearly 120 stations			1
the crush to board is so bad commuters take trains in the wrong direction so they can grab seats when they turn around			2
fatal accidents are so common that stations stock sheets to cover corpses , and officials spend hours entering details of mangled remains to try to identify victims in a gruesome database			1
in the first four months of this year , more than 1,200 people have been killed , according to official figures			1
many get run over crossing the tracks , too rushed or tired to use pedestrian overpasses			0
" people here believe in shortcuts which is a very bad habit , " rail official @entity71 said with extravagant understatement			0
his office fined about 30,000 people $ 12 each last year for breaking rules			2
tickets average about 10 rupees ( 25 cents )			0
last year , 186 people died when bombs went off on seven trains during the evening rush hour			1
the @entity86 built the first railways in @entity0 in the 1850s , but more recently a lack of investment and a city growing rapidly as migrants flood in has stretched the system to breaking point			1
officials are splashing out on a $ 2 billion upgrade -- the first major overhaul since independence in 1947 -- that will add 180 km ( 110 miles ) of new track and 147 trains over five years			0
but even when all these new coaches are rolling , commuter trains will have to carry 1.5 times their capacity at peak hours			1
for @entity0 's 17 million residents , the railways are indispensable but a form of slow torture : traveling from the southern business districts to the ever - lengthening northern suburbs where most live takes about two hours			1
road travel is also painfully slow and often impossible during the annual monsoon , when torrential rains flood streets waist deep			0
@entity0 's stations are busy round the clock , as waiting passengers , new arrivals with one way tickets looking for work , the homeless , beggars , drug addicts , dogs and cows battle for space			1
trains -- plastered with adverts for items like toothpaste , underwear and condoms -- run every five to seven minutes , but delays are common , leading edgy commuters to hit out at the slightest provocation			0
angry passengers riot a few times each year , rampaging through stations and , occasionally , torching trains and clashing with police			1
" we feel like goats and sheep herded into a compartment with no space to move and no proper ventilation , " said 52 - year - old shop owner @entity138			0
" i bet no high - level government official ever takes a ride back home in these crowded trains			0
the day they are forced into one , i am sure immediate action will be taken			0
" authorities say the ongoing network upgrade will improve matters , but commuters are skeptical			0
" plans are always made , but nothing really happens , " said @entity154 , a young commuter			0
" if they want to do something , it had better be quick			0
