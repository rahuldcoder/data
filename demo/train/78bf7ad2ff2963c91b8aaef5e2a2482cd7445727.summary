she was killed in the name of " honor , " on the grounds her actions had brought shame on her family			2
" i do not even wish to use the phrase ' honour killing ' : there is not the faintest vestige of honour in killing a woman in this way , " @entity20 @entity19 said in a statement condemning the killing			1
@entity19 called on @entity13 's government to work harder to stop such killings and protect women from violence			1
according to a report published in april by the @entity37 of @entity13 , 869 women in the country were the victims of honor killings last year			1
and activists say the true number may be much higher			0
@entity10 's killing is all the more shocking because it was so public			1
she was beaten to death with bricks close to the high court in the eastern city of @entity48 by a group of about 20 people , including her brothers , father and cousin , police said			1
one family member made a noose of rough cloth around her neck while her brothers smashed bricks into her skull , said @entity61 , a police official , citing the preliminary report into the killing			1
she was three months pregnant , he said			0
so - called honor killings often originate from tribal traditions in @entity13 but are not a part of @entity67			1
although they 're common in rural areas , tuesday 's attack in a public area of a big city was unusual			2
police officials said @entity10 , who came from a village in @entity75 , had refused to wed the cousin whom her family had selected for her , choosing instead to elope with a widower named @entity79			1
the cousin intended for her husband was among the people who attacked her , police said			2
@entity85 woman sentenced to death for her @entity87 gives birth ' barbaric ' attack the family had challenged @entity10 's marriage to @entity79 in the courts , accusing him of abducting her			1

" another case is settled outside the courts			0
another woman , in search of justice , stoned to death , in the name of honor			0
" @entity118 , a human rights activist based in @entity119 , said the real number may be far higher than the @entity37 's official count since many families do n't report the crimes			0
she said that in many cases , people outside the family do n't step in to protect the victim			2

it is a cultural form of violence which is quite prevalent in certain parts of @entity13			2
" honor killings happen more often in rural , tribal areas , @entity118 said , but urban cases occur , too			0
since many cases are not reported , police have no record and rights groups that try to document what 's happening must do so through media reports and incomplete data			0
" there is no systematic information gathered in @entity13 that tells us the extent of the problem , " she said			2
@entity154 said to encourage killers and the killers often avoid prosecution			0
under an @entity67 element of @entity13 law , known as the law of @entity163 , the family of a victim is allowed to forgive the perpetrator , according to the human rights commission 's report			1
" thus the victim 's family usually is related to the perpetrator as well , and conveniently forgives their kin , absolving them of the murder , " the report said			0
that possibility of impunity has " continued to encourage others to follow suit , " it said			0
@entity118 gave a similar picture and called for a change in @entity13 's laws to protect women and the vulnerable			1
" basically , the people have no fear of law because there is a culture of impunity and , as a result of that , people feel free and they can commit such acts outside the courts of justice , " she said			0
she blames such actions also on violent and extremist attitudes which , she said , drive people to act even if they are aware of the potential consequences			0
" i think we must generally reflect on the sick mindset of the society , " she said			0
