an ocean at least as large as @entity5 lies below a thick layer of ice on a moon of @entity9 , new data from @entity3 's @entity2 spacecraft suggests			1
the results , published in the journal @entity12 , support earlier signs that this small moon has liquid water			1
that means @entity9 's sixth - largest moon could have been -- or could now be -- hospitable to life			2
this discovery puts @entity20 in an exclusive club of extraterrestrial worlds in the solar system that appear to have a subsurface water ocean			1
the others are @entity26 , another moon of @entity9 , and @entity28 , a moon of @entity30			2
@entity32 and @entity33 , also moons of @entity30 , may also have oceans under ice			0
" as far as whether one should go first to @entity28 or @entity20 , i look at this as a kind of a cornucopia of habitable environments in the outer solar system , " study co-author @entity36 of @entity37 said in a press conference wednesday			2
what we think is there the north pole of @entity20 has a thickness of ice around 30 miles , with solid rock beneath it			1
but at the south pole , there may be only 18 to 24 miles of ice covering a subsurface ocean that itself is 5 to 10 miles deep			1
this ocean appears to be a " lens - shaped reservoir " that 's deepest at the south pole and thinner further afield			1
the ocean appears to sit on top of a rocky core and " may extend halfway or more towards the equator in every direction , " said study co-author @entity65 , professor of planetary science at @entity67 , in a press conference			0
also noteworthy is that the north pole is heavily cratered , while the ice on the south pole is smoother , meaning it has been resurfaced and softened			1
measurements from the new study and previous @entity2 data suggest the moon 's south pole has an ice layer on top of water on top of silicate rock			1
if that 's true , water circulating through the rock would pick up elements such as phosphorous , sulfur , potassium and sodium into the liquid			2
these elements are essential for making molecules that life needs , @entity36 said			0
with respect to the ocean being on top of rock , the gravity data from @entity20 " makes the base of the ocean very much like the base of our own ocean on the @entity98 , " @entity36 said at the press conference			1
@entity20 is a small moon , with a diameter of only about 310 miles			1
in 2005 , @entity2 found that fractures called " tiger stripes " in the south polar region emit water vapor jets rich in salt , lead author @entity111 of @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 , said in a press conference wednesday			2
@entity2 has also detected organic molecules , which can come from biological or nonbiological sources , near the tiger stripes and in dust grains in the region			0
a moon of @entity9 may have ' tropical ' lakes how do we know ? no one has actually gone to @entity20 and seen this ocean under the thick ice layer			1
but scientists have strong evidence that it is there , based on gravity measurements made with @entity2			0
when the spacecraft flies by @entity20 , the gravity of the moon changes the probe 's speed			2
scientists can measure those changes back on @entity98 by detecting fluctuations in the frequency of the signal that @entity2 sends back			0
if the spacecraft 's speed does n't change , the frequency would remain the same			0
but depending on where @entity2 flies , the frequency of the signal changes in particular ways			0
this allows scientists to learn more about the moon 's subsurface features			2
scientists had already known about the presence of a depression or " dimple " at the south pole of @entity20 , " as if there is some amount of , effectively , missing material , " @entity36 said			1
but in this new study , the change in gravity associated with the depression was not as dramatic as expected			0
" there must be some higher density layer that 's underneath the ice , and that has to be a liquid water ocean , because there 's really nothing else plausible that can explain that offset to what we would expect for the gravity signature of this depression , " he said			1
it is possible that this ocean has been sending out the plumes that @entity2 first observed in 2005 , but this has not been verified			0
how can we look for signs of life there ? sending a probe to @entity20 with a drill would n't be entirely practical because the liquid water is so far under the ice that it would be hard to access , @entity36 said			1
instead , a spacecraft with instruments more sophisticated than @entity2 could fly through the plumes of material being ejected from fractures in the ice			0
@entity2 has already detected the water vapor and organic molecules in these plumes , using a device called a mass spectrometer			0
but a more advanced , more sensitive version of the same instrument could better test for the " menu of molecules " associated with an advanced biological system , @entity36 said			0
detecting these molecules could be " the smoking gun for whether in fact there is life down there or not , " he said .			0

@entity20 is a small moon of @entity9
new data suggest a subsurface ocean under its south pole
gravity *experiment* *inferred* that there must be liquid water there
@entity221 of ice likely cover a subsurface ocean that itself is 5 to 10 miles deep
