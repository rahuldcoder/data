-- in this era of ever - accelerating technological development , we all tend to be so fixated on the gizmos of the future that we rarely take the time to think about the glorious technology of the past			2
fortunately , a treasure trove of rarities , oddities and tech " firsts " has been brought together -- including an experimental 17th century mechanical calculator , a hundred - year - old telephone and an incredibly rare , headline - grabbing @entity16 1 computer -- to be sold at auction saturday in @entity18 , @entity19			1
while they may look dated today , the objects gathered by @entity21 trace an evolution of technological thinking that stretches from the dawn of the industrial revolution through to the present day			2
it is a story of cutting edge tinkering ; an inventors ' hall of fame			0
basking in the limelight at the auction will be one of just six surviving functional @entity16 1 computers -- a tech superstar which is likely to sell for a small fortune -- an estimated $ 400,000 -- propelled by bids from collectors , museums and @entity40			1
the @entity16 1 was the first computer built by the @entity43 technology company			1
the computer was hand - assembled by @entity16 co-founder @entity45 , who , according to legend , financed the device 's construction by selling his @entity50 calculator ( co-founder @entity51 also sold his @entity53 campervan )			1
approximately 200 of the devices were made , of which fewer than 50 are thought to remain -- and only six in working order			1
@entity58 founder @entity57 said the sale is " unique in presenting masterpieces from the spectrum of antique technology , from the 17th century to the 21st			0
" long before the current era of computers , the inventor @entity64 designed a mechanical calculator in 1642 -- regarded by many as the first decisive step toward modern microprocessors			2
the " @entity73 " was operated with a stylus to turn digit - wheels			0
these wheels connected to a " display " on the top of the device which showed the result after each equation			0
a sliding rule could be shifted to change the function of the device from addition to subtraction			0
multiplication and division were also possible ( though very difficult to execute )			0
the @entity73 was a significant breakthrough at the time of its invention , demonstrating , as it did , how complex arithmetic could be carried out by a machine			0
its introduction led to the development of mechanical calculators across @entity95			2
only a handful of the original @entity73 machines still exist today -- most of which are held in museums			1
at auction saturday will be a 20th - century reproduction , valued between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000			1
alongside the @entity16 1 and the @entity73 will be an original @entity102 , one of the earliest computers to feature a graphical interface and mouse -- technologies which paved the way for desktop computing as we know it today			1
the @entity102 was a commercial failure , in part due to its inordinately high price			0
retailing at $ 10,000 , it was significantly more expensive than rival @entity115 @entity16 , for its part , owes much of its success to some of the early pioneering personal computers such as the @entity121 -- a kit computer which was released in 1973			1
its 8 - bit @entity124 microprocessor was incredibly powerful at the time ( though only a tiny fraction of contemporary processor power )			0
just 200 or so @entity129 were made , making them quite valuable			0
the @entity121 up for auction tomorrow is expected to go for $ 20,000 to $ 25,000			1
as well as early artefacts from computing 's prehistory , the auction will feature a number of historical typewriters			1
a patent was lodged by @entity139 for a typing device as early as 1714 , but typewriters did n't go into mass production until the 1860s			1
today it is difficult to see them as anything but antiquated , yet the invention of typewriters caused a revolution in writing			1
a range of early typewriters will be sold , including an extremely rare 1895 @entity153 typewriter with a filigree copper grille valued between $ 13,000 and $ 20,000 , an @entity155 with gold - gilt highlights and mother - of - pearl inlay , and a rather more functional - looking @entity158 , with an unusual keyless design , which is expected to fetch between $ 11,000 and $ 15,000			1
another " first " to go under the hammer is a portable copying press devised by the legendary @entity163 inventor of the steam - engine , @entity162			0
the laptop - sized invention allowed multiple copies of a document to be produced , something like a photocopier , with ink transferred from the original to moistened copying paper below via a pressure plate			0
the portable device was said to be a favourite of @entity177 president @entity176			0
of even greater significance to communication was the invention of the telephone in the mid- 19th century			0
from its early experimental incarnations in the workshops of a number of inventors including @entity186 , the telephone was in broad use by the beginning of the 20th century			2
could @entity186 have predicted how contemporary telephony , with cell phones , texting and @entity191 would look today ? it 's unlikely			2
but if you fancy picking up the low - tech progenitor of your @entity195 you could bid on a 1905 l. @entity197 desk telephone , known as the " coffee grinder " due to its circular shape and unusual lithographed decoration			0
it is expected to sell for up $ 13,000 .			2

@entity16 1 computer could sell at auction for $ 400,000
only 50 @entity16 1 computers are thought to exist today
auction in @entity18 , @entity19 will also feature early telephones , typewriters , calculators
