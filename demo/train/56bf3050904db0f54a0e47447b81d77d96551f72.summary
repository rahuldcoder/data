-- @entity1 have officially unveiled the car they hope will rocket @entity3 and @entity5 into the @entity7 title reckoning in 2011			1
the team 's @entity9 drivers were on hand as their new @entity13 car was assembled part - by - part with the help of competition winners in the center of the @entity19 capital @entity20 on friday			1
@entity1 have won just one world championship since 1998 and lagged behind @entity22 and @entity23 last year			0
but they are hoping a raft of new features on their car will propel them into the drivers ' championship running			2
@entity3 , the 2008 world title winner , finished fourth in 2010 , 16 points behind the eventual winner , @entity33 of @entity23			0
@entity5 , who succeeded @entity3 as world champion in 2009 , came 42 points off the pace in fifth			2
the @entity13 is packed with innovative features to help with its aerodynamics , including an electronically adjustable rear - wing system and an all - new electric hybrid kers system , to comply with this season 's @entity7 rule changes			1
" we 've seen it in the wind tunnel quite a lot , but it looks even better full - size , " @entity3 said on @entity7 official website			1
" i think people saw a unique way of revealing our 2010 car , something that 's never been done before			0
i hope the car proves just as innovative once we take to the track			0
" i head into 2011 in a relaxed but determined frame of mind			0
i 've spared nothing during my winter fitness preparations and , in many ways , i feel as fit , focused and refreshed as i did ahead of my first season in @entity7 in 2007			2
" so my aim for this year is to ensure that everything comes together in the best possible way and that , like last year , i 'm able to fight for the title right down to the final race			0
" @entity3 's teammate @entity5 said it was an " empowering feeling " having had an input on the design of @entity1 's new car			1
he said he was looking forward to testing the car in @entity75 next week , ahead of the opening race in @entity77 on march 13			1
" today really marks the beginning of our 2011 season after what seems a very long time away from the track , " he said			0
" i ca n't wait to get behind the wheel of @entity13 - 26 for the first time next week			1
" it 's strange to think that this is only the start of my second season at @entity1 , because i 've felt so comfortable since joining the team last january			2
" for the new season , i 've not only got a year 's experience under my belt , but i 've also been able to offer input into the design and development of the new car -- something that i was naturally unable to do last year			0
