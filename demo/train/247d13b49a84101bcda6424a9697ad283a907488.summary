-- @entity1 underlined their impressive credentials ahead of @entity4 with a 3 - 0 thrashing of arch - rivals the @entity7 on tuesday in @entity8			1
the @entity9 , who will be among the favorites next year in @entity11 and @entity12 , swept aside the 2010 @entity14 runners - up with veteran striker @entity15 inspirational			0

it left him just five short of the legendary @entity23 's all - time record			0
the 33 - year - old @entity25 striker then worked in @entity27 's @entity26 for a close range strike in the 66th minute as @entity1 sealed their first win over the @entity30 since 1996			2
" the whole team made the match a lot of fun to play in , " @entity26 told @entity31			0

just three days after a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity47 , @entity45 's @entity36 fell behind on 31 minutes in @entity48 when forward @entity49 capitalized on an error from goalkeeper @entity51 to clip a shot over defender @entity53 and into the empty net			1
it was a nightmare moment for @entity27 's @entity51 , who was celebrating making his 127th appearance for @entity36 and becoming their most - capped player			2
it got worse for @entity36 three minutes before half time when @entity61 striker @entity60 , who is on - loan from @entity64 side @entity63 , doubled @entity42 's lead			1

elsewhere , @entity47 made it two wins in five days at @entity82 with a hard - fought 1 - 0 win over @entity84			1
@entity47 made several changes from the side which beat @entity36 1 - 0 last saturday , but were largely in command for much of the match against their fellow @entity4 qualifiers			1
it was @entity47 's first win over @entity84 in 43 years and captain @entity93 , recalled to the team despite being under investigation for alleged racial abuse , said he never had any intention of sitting the match out because of the controversy			2
" no chance , " he said			0
" i 'm very passionate , very confident being @entity47 captain and very proud to be , also			0
" @entity47 's only goal in the first half , their 2,000th in internationals , was originally given to midfielder @entity108 , but his header took a final touch off @entity84 's @entity111			2
debutant @entity112 missed a glorious opportunity for his first goal for @entity47 and @entity116 youngster @entity115 also went close as the home side might have added further to their tally against a below - par @entity120 side who rarely threatened			0
meanwhile in @entity123 , @entity122 scored the only goal of the game as @entity126 beat @entity127 1 - 0 win in the @entity129			1
