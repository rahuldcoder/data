-- the latest @entity2 revelations may have incurred the wrath of @entity5 secretary of state @entity4 , who warned they could even " put people 's lives in danger , " but some seasoned observers believe the episode will prove more embarrassing than damaging in the longer term			1
on sunday the whistle - blowing website began publishing more than 250,000 cables from @entity5 embassies around the world , in what it said was the largest - ever disclosure of confidential information			1
the cables will be released over the course of several months , giving the world " an unprecedented insight into the @entity5 government 's foreign activities , " it said			1
the @entity28 , @entity30 's @entity29 , @entity33 's @entity32 magazine and the @entity35 daily @entity34 were all given advance copies of the documents			1
what is @entity2 ? among the revelations so far are allegations that : -- @entity42 's @entity41 urged the @entity5 to attack @entity43 to halt its nuclear program , warning that if @entity45 were to go nuclear , other countries in the region would too			1
-- @entity48 was growing " frustrated " with @entity49 and worried that its nuclear program posed a " threat to the whole world 's security			2
" -- @entity54 president @entity53 was playing " @entity58 " to prime minister 's @entity56 's " @entity55			0
" " this disclosure is not just an attack on @entity5 's foreign policy ; it is an attack on the international community , the alliances and partnerships , the conventions and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity , " @entity59 told reporters monday			1
transparency ? we used to call it spying but @entity74 , former @entity30 ambassador to @entity43 , told @entity0 wednesday that although it was a " wake - up call " for the @entity5 , it would not suffer any lasting damage			1
" some people may be reluctant to talk to @entity5 diplomats in some countries , while some statesmen may be reluctant to express their minds freely , " he said			2
" but in the long term things are going to get back to normal simply because the @entity5 will correct some of the weaknesses in their approach to computer security			2
" we do n't have the full details of @entity88 's operations or the @entity90 's operations all over the media , even though the things they do are very much in the public interest			0
so i think the @entity5 government has simply messed up			2
" @entity74 also cast doubt on the contention that @entity5 personnel serving abroad would be in greater danger as a result of the leaked cables			1
" i do n't think it 's likely , " he said			0
" this is political analysis , not military			0
" timeline : @entity108 releases in october , @entity2 released nearly 400,000 @entity5 military reports about operations in @entity111			1
in july , it released more than 70,000 reports from the war in @entity114			0
however the @entity5 government has not said whether any of its military personnel have died as a result of this leaked information			1
@entity118 , professor of international relations at the @entity120 , said the @entity5 government was " overreacting " in the interest of its own reputation , adding that he understood great care was taken by news organizations to ensure potentially sensitive material was not released			1
" this is going to be more embarrassing than damaging for the @entity5 , " he told @entity0			2
" there wo n't be many surprises			0
if there are a few personal insults , then elected individuals can live with those			0
at the end of the day what matters are interests , and interests wo n't be affected			0
" for example , what we 've learned about @entity42 's overtures to the @entity5 did n't come as any surprise			1
perhaps the tone was different , but it 's not as if we 're learning something new about @entity42 's views vis - a - vis @entity43			0
it wo n't have come as a surprise to @entity43 either			0
" it will be an embarrassment in terms of the public perception of relations between the @entity5 government and other governments			2
" the international reaction to the diplomatic cables has so far been relatively mixed			2
@entity54 's @entity56 , who was described as an " alpha dog , " told @entity0 's @entity156 on tuesday that " leaks have happened before , and @entity2 is not a catastrophe			1
" the @entity160 government released a statement wednesday calling the controversial website a " threat to democracy " after president @entity165 was described in @entity5 embassy memos as " thin - skinned and authoritarian			2
" @entity169 prime minister @entity168 had threatened to sue the @entity5 after some of the cables accused him of corruption			1
" this is the @entity5 ' problem , not ours ... those who have slandered us will be crushed under these claims , will be finished and will disappear , " he said in quotes carried by @entity175			0
a @entity181 foreign ministry spokesman told @entity0 fears over the nation 's nuclear weapons were misplaced			0
he was reacting to a cable in the @entity28 that mentioned the @entity5 ambassador in @entity187 was concerned over a supply of highly enriched uranium at an aging research reactor , allegedly enough to build several " dirty bombs			1
" " their fears are misplaced and doubtless fall in the realm of condescension , " spokesman @entity192 said			0
" there has not been a single incident involving our fissile material which clearly reflects how strong our controls and mechanisms are			0
" @entity192 said @entity181 has " extended experience in handling nuclear stuff			0
" @entity0 's @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
