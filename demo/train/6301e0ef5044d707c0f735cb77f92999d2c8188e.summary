@entity0 , @entity1 -- in between selling tickets and greeting customers , @entity3 turned his curvy 6 - feet - tall frame to survey the spacious dance hall and revealed he is no ordinary doorman at this extraordinary place			1
@entity3 hosts a drag show in @entity0 while not manning a ballroom dance hall for older gay men			1
" when i first started this , it was only a dozen or so of us , " reminisced the former factory worker - turned - drag queen			2
" now 300 people or more come each night			0
" welcome to @entity18 , arguably the only entertainment venue for older gay men in @entity0 , if not the whole of @entity1			1
tucked away in a rundown neighborhood in the city 's northeast , @entity25 sits atop a public bathhouse , and features cracked wooden floors and a primitive sound system			0
its location and facilities , however , belie its prominence in a community that thrives almost entirely underground			2
every weekend , men flock here to unleash their ballroom dancing skill as well as their true identities for three treasured hours			1
@entity25 's " gay nights " are only on fridays , saturdays and sundays			2
casually dressed in jeans and sneakers , men of various ages -- but mostly in their 40 's and upwards -- and shapes filled the dimly lit dance floor one recent evening			1
they waltzed , jitterbugged and rumbaed in pairs to the nostalgic @entity48 tunes churned out by a live band on the small stage			0
" you wo n't see this anywhere else , " said @entity3 , organizer of this regular gathering , himself a middle - aged gay man whose dual passions lie in ballroom dancing and performing in drag			1
on this sunday night , however , he was out of drag , donning a sweater and cargo pants			2
" i do n't really do this for the money -- it 's just great fun			0
" patrons pay a mere 5 yuan ( 70 @entity65 cents ) to enter and enjoy cheap drinks -- a bottle of beer costs just 3 yuan			2
observing from the sidelines , one of @entity3 's fellow drag queens -- known as teacher @entity71 -- noted most older gay men do n't feel comfortable going to the more expensive bars or clubs frequented by the younger generation			1
" it 's a totally different culture and environment in those places , while everyone fits right in here , " said the 58 - year - old former soldier and retired school administrator			0
" it 's a rare outlet for people to relax , to find friends or sex			0
" @entity71 's personal story mirrors those of many patrons at @entity91			0
realizing he was gay at an early age , @entity71 -- like many gay men in @entity1 -- married a woman because of family and social pressure			1
he is expecting to become a grandfather this autumn			0
" my wife and my son have suspicions about me , but it 's always going to be a question mark in their minds , " @entity71 said			0
" they have seen me perform folk dance in drag , but i will never let them see me in an intimate situation with another man			1
" unlike many among @entity25 's largely blue - collar clientele , @entity71 said success in running his own catering business has injected freedom and flexibility into his closeted life			0
" i bought a big duplex for my wife , and i told her i would stay in the old apartment to concentrate on work , " @entity71 said			0
" @entity1 women at her age are very pragmatic -- they are satisfied as long as you take good care of the family			1
" taking precautions family issues aside , activists have pointed to inconsistencies in government policy to explain older gay men 's reluctance to come out			1
although homosexuality is not illegal in @entity1 and has been removed from the country 's list of officially recognized mental disorders since 2001 , it remains a taboo topic in the state - run media			1
gay venues have popped up in major cities across @entity1 in recent years , but the authorities sometimes shut them down during politically sensitive times			1
the upcoming @entity149 appears to be one such occasion , amid reports of a series of recent police raids on gay clubs , saunas and cruising spots in @entity157 and @entity0			1
activists have voiced their worries about a new crackdown aimed at " cleaning up " the country ahead of the @entity162 in august			2
both @entity71 and @entity3 said they will keep a low profile and be even more cautious about staging drag shows in the next few months			2
as an extra precaution , they requested their real names not published and @entity3 also insisted no pictures be taken at @entity25			0
for now the dance routines continue and have attracted new fans like @entity171 , an @entity65 volunteer with a local aids - prevention organization			2
@entity171 , 50 , has been visiting @entity25 with fellow volunteers to hand out free condoms and safe - sex literature			0
while he loves the uniquely romantic dance scene , @entity171 emphasized that he has an urgent message for @entity1 gay men of his age group			1
he said many people in this generation , because of their educational and social background , have never used a condom before -- either with their wives or with their male sex partners			2
" i had three friends in the @entity65 die in the 1980 's of @entity188 , " @entity171 said			0
" the people at @entity91 do n't realize @entity188 is really close to them and it 's spreading quickly in the gay community here			0
" acknowledging the rising hiv - infection rate among gay men , @entity1 health officials have quietly started their own outreach program , which calls for sending trained staff to gay venues nationwide to promote @entity188 awareness and encourage voluntary testing			1
although he has welcomed the volunteers and admires @entity171 's dedication , @entity3 still focuses his attention on dancing			0
he is even prepared to set his sights on an alternative " @entity149 " event that includes ballroom dancing as a competitive sport			1
" in the future we might , " @entity3 responded when asked if he and other @entity25 regulars would join the @entity209 -- the gay answer to the @entity149 -- next to be held in 2010 in @entity211 , @entity212			1
" we probably wo n't win , " he said with a laugh			0
" but i bet we could finish in 6th place ! " @entity217 is a @entity157 - based freelance writer and former @entity2 producer .			0

old dance hall one of few underground gay clubs in @entity0 for older generation
caters for a different generation who enjoy ballroom dancing and drag acts
homosexuality is not illegal in @entity1 , but culturally *difficult* for older men to come out
many fear a crackdown on gay clubs in the lead up to the @entity149
