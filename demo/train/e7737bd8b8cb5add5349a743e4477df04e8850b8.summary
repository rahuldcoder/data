@entity0 is one of the greatest relief pitchers in baseball history , and he spent nine years of his career closing games for the @entity4 's			1
so surely , if there is somebody out there who believed this current team could have a remarkable season like this , it 's him			1
right ? " not a chance , " @entity0 said over the phone			0
the @entity4 's did lose 88 games last season , finishing a full 22 games behind @entity17 in the @entity19 standings			1
it would be hard to project that they 'd win that division before the season			2
but surely , if somebody could have believed that this ridiculously young team would take off at midseason and stun the @entity28 in the final game , it would be a legend from the team 's glory days like @entity0			1
right ? " nope , " @entity0 , now an analyst for @entity33 , said over the phone			0
" i mean , i did n't really buy into ( this team ) until a couple months ago			2
i think i got a call from somebody at the trade deadline who said , ' do you still think they 're pretenders ? ' and i still thought they were ! " @entity0 is forgiven			0
the @entity4 's magical season is so confounded , so unexpected , that you really do n't even know where to begin			1
it 's hard to even pick out the most mind - bending number related to their success			1
is it 13 , the number of games back they were in the standings on june 30 , making their comeback to win the division one of the five biggest in baseball history ? is it five , the number of games back they were just nine days ago , when their chances to make the playoffs at all , much less win the @entity19 , seemed borderline at best			1
is it four , the number of runs they were down in the final game against the @entity28 , before they scored the next 11 to storm back for a 12 - 5 win and a champagne - drenched celebration ? is it .238 , the overall team batting average , which is the third lowest in all of baseball ? or 15 , the number of rookies on the current roster ? or 94 , the number of victories this team won ? for most , it 'll be this number : $ 55 million			1
that 's the entire a 's payroll , the second lowest in the major leagues			1
they are proving that , in an era when sports are big business and the biggest spenders are usually the biggest winners , that it 's possible to win without breaking the bank			2
that 's why , in the estimation of @entity97 analyst @entity96 , " they 're the best story in baseball			2
" maybe this is a good spot for a quick history lesson : the @entity4 's are hardly some plucky newcomer			1
they are one of the eight founding members of the @entity19 , a franchise with roots in @entity104 that adopted an elephant as its mascot because old @entity108 manager @entity107 called the team " a white elephant			1
" it moved from @entity104 to @entity112 to @entity4 , in 1968 , and were known mostly for its eccentric owner @entity113 -- he changed the elephant mascot into a mule that paraded around the stadium -- until it emerged as a dynasty in the 1970s			1
those a 's won the @entity122 from 1972 - 74 , and after @entity113 sold the team , again in 1989 with the " @entity124 , " @entity125 and @entity126			1
that remains the franchise 's last championship , but it was n't the end of its relevance			2
savvy general manager @entity133 , knowing he had less money to pay players than other franchises , created a radical system for building his teams that relied less on traditional scouting and more on statistical analysis			1
that formula led to five postseason appearances in the early 2000s and was documented by the bestselling book " @entity146 " and later a movie by the same name			0
@entity133 is still the @entity147 , making the @entity4 's perhaps the first franchise in sports history where the @entity147 is more well known that any of the players -- @entity150 , after all , did play him in the movie			1
but @entity151 might soon wish it had waited , because this team might end up a better story			2
" it 's the perfect storm with so many things coming together , " @entity0 said			2
" i 'd like to see this thing go all the way to the @entity122 , you know , to do more than just get into the playoffs			0
" @entity160 : hottest hitters heading into playoffs @entity0 is most amazed by the young pitching staff			0
this is a staff entirely of rookie starters and none of them household names			0
@entity168 and @entity169 won 13 games			0
even the team leader in saves -- @entity173 -- has a name that suggests something other than pitching acumen			2
you wo n't find stars in the lineup , either			0
@entity180 led the team with 32 home runs and 85 rbi			2
@entity184 led the way with a .292 batting average			0
@entity189 is the designated hitter and one of the few veterans in the clubhouse			0
" it 's surreal , " first baseman @entity193 said on the @entity4 's broadcast after they won the division			1
" we 've enjoyed every step of the way			0
there was never any pressure on us			0
we were supposed to lose 100 games			0
" maybe that 's part of it			0
" it 's totally different when you 're a position when nobody expects you to win , " he said			0
" i 've never been on a team like that in my life			0
" he might not have picked them before the season or during it , but @entity0 has had a change of heart			0
pitching , he believes , is the key to any team winning the @entity122 and the @entity215 closer thinks the @entity4 's have the arms to compete with anybody in the postseason			1
they 'll open in @entity220 on saturday in the division series , where once again they 'll face a team with twice its payroll and star power			1
but for once , at least , everyone will see them coming			0
@entity33 will have exclusive coverage of the first - ever @entity230 games on friday , october 5			1
the network will also be the exclusive home of up to 18 @entity234 games and the entire @entity235			0
