the long - dormant @entity1 peace efforts got new life on friday			2
an agreement has been reached that " establishes a basis for resuming direct final status negotiations between " @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 said in @entity10 , @entity11			1
" this is a significant and welcome step forward , " @entity3 said			0
this came as @entity3 visited the @entity1 this week and came up with a formula for reanimating peace talks between @entity9 and the @entity8 territories , a source close to the talks said			1
he has been working intensely with the @entity8 side to get them on board			0
earlier friday , in a meeting in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity3 presented the plan to @entity8 chief peace negotiator @entity24 in hopes that it will entice the @entity8 back to the negotiating table			2
@entity3 arrived in @entity28 in the @entity29 on friday afternoon and began a meeting with president @entity31 for the third time during his current trip to the @entity1			0
new city offers vision of better life in @entity29 talks could begin soon in @entity38 , according to the official @entity40 news agency , @entity39 , which quoted the authority 's spokesman , @entity43			1
@entity44 said " certain details " were still in need of solutions , but " if things go well , @entity3 will extend an invitation to @entity24 and the representative of the @entity9 side , to meet him in @entity38 , to hold primary talks in the coming few days			1
" @entity9 justice minister @entity53 lauded the prospect of peace			1
" these past few months were long , filled with doubt and cynicism , " @entity53 said in a statement			0
" but now , four years of political stagnation are coming to an end			1
" i know that , despite this being an opportunity , once the negotiations begin they will be complex -- but i am convinced with all my heart that this is the right thing for our future , our security , our economy and @entity9 's values , " @entity53 said			1
she expressed respect for prime minister @entity72 " for making the decisions representing @entity9 's important interests , as well for @entity4 secretary of state , @entity3 , which led us and the @entity8 into the negotiations room			1
" in the @entity8 territory of @entity81 , however , @entity79 dismissed the renewed effort for peace talks			1
" this negotiation will be useless			2
it is not going to achieve anything for the @entity8 people			0
it will not help the prisoner issue , the border issue or the land issue , " the group said in a statement			0
@entity9 imposed an economic blockade on @entity81 shortly after @entity79 was elected to run the @entity81 government in 2006			1
@entity3 said the agreement is still in the process of being formalized , so " we are absolutely not going to talk about the elements now , " he said			0
if everything goes as expected , representatives for the two sides will join @entity3 in @entity38 " for initial talks within the next week or so , and a further announcement will be made by all of us at that time			1
" " any speculation or reports you may read in the media ... are conjecture ... because the people who know the facts are not talking about them , " he said			0
talks based on land swaps , pre- 1967 borders ? one of the reports @entity3 might have been referencing was a @entity118 report quoting an @entity9 official who said the jewish state agreed to a plan for peace talks based on pre- 1967 borders and land swaps			1
it would be in line with a decades - old @entity128 resolution calling on @entity9 to release territories it gained during a war , a demand that @entity9 has historically fought			2
but it would help create contiguous borders for a future @entity8 state that would coexist next to a jewish state			0
@entity9 's official reaction to the report has been denial			1
@entity140 , a spokesman for @entity72 , rejected the news agency story and questioned who in the government would have made the assertions			0
@entity3 had set up shop in @entity10 , @entity11 , where he has already advertised the plan to the @entity147 and to @entity31			0
@entity31 briefed politicians in @entity28 after returning from his initial meetings with @entity3			0
news of the plan triggered a reaction friday from @entity152 , a prominent @entity8 legislator			0
" we need written commitments that there are terms of reference including commitment to 1967 borders			0
we need affirmation or guarantees that there will be no settlement expansions , " he said			0
other @entity8 would not accept negotiations as long as they continued to grow , he added			0
@entity9 has recently announced plans to add on to @entity29 settlements , drawing angry responses from @entity8 and criticism from @entity9 's @entity171 allies			1
the major bones of contention in negotiations are : the status of @entity176			0
@entity9 regards the entire city as its capital			2
the @entity8 regard @entity176 as the capital of a future @entity8 state			0
jewish settlements in the @entity29			0
the land is known as @entity183 and @entity184 in @entity186 history , and @entity9 say they believe that territory is part of the jewish state			2
the @entity8 say the @entity29 is @entity8 land			0
they also say they 've been mistreated in their own land for years by @entity9 's government , the military and settlers			1
@entity9 has said it wants to be assured of the safety of its citizens from attacks by @entity8 militants in any peace agreement			1
the status of the @entity8 , who mostly departed @entity9 during two wars : one that led to the state 's founding in 1948 , and one in 1967			1
@entity8 say they were driven out			0
war spoils @entity9 took over @entity176 , the @entity29 , @entity81 , @entity206 and the @entity207 after it defeated @entity209 states in the @entity210 in 1967			1
in a series of moves following its capture , @entity9 effectively annexed @entity176 , putting it and other adjacent areas in the @entity29 under @entity9 government control			2
since then , @entity9 has forged a peace treaty with @entity217 and returned @entity206 to the country			2
it later unilaterally departed from @entity81 , now run by @entity79			1
@entity9 occupies the @entity8 territory of the @entity29 and part of @entity221 's @entity207			2
for years , @entity9 and the @entity40 have made attempts to negotiate , but have repeatedly failed to get the process moving			1
a sporting push for peace in @entity9 - @entity8 relations			2

@entity40 says " if things go well , " talks could begin in @entity38 in " coming days "
" four years of political stagnation are coming to an end , " @entity9 's justice minister says
@entity79 in @entity81 dismisses peace negotiations as " useless "
a report says peace formula involves a *landmark* *concession* from @entity9
