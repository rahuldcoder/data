-- i do n't know what 's more offensive : rancher @entity3 telling blacks they 'd be better off as slaves picking cotton or conservatives who continue to defend him			1
not only were his comments racist , but under no stretch of the imagination could anyone argue blacks were better off during slavery with no rights , working for free and being held the property of white people			2
i tweeted my outrage at @entity3 's remarks , who by the way is a @entity21 , and to my surprise many of my followers excused his behavior , tweeting things like : " i do n't think he 's a racist			1
" more like @entity3 is " an old school racist " is what i responded			1
others tweeted things like i " needed to go back and watch the clip with an open mind			0
" or that " the @entity3 issue is about @entity36 overreach please do n't follow libs and make it about race			1
" i 've watched the clip many times with a very open mind and each time i come to the same conclusion : @entity3 is a racist			1
if slavery was such a great institution and better than being on welfare , as @entity3 declared , why does n't @entity3 go back in time , become a slave and pick cotton for plantation owners without getting paid ? he needs a history lesson about the horrors of slavery and why " we blacks " no longer call ourselves @entity56			2
i 'm glad to see many conservatives swiftly condemned @entity3 's comments			1
but the real insult to injury for me as a black conservative woman is they never should have embraced him in the first place			1
conservatives are supposed to be the party that believes in adhering to the @entity66 and the laws of our land			2
we talk about this to the point of obsession , myself included , with regard to issues like immigration , affirmative action , @entity78 , etc. yet conservatives of all kinds could n't wait to support @entity82 rancher @entity3 , who for over 20 years has refused to follow the laws of our land and @entity66 by not paying over $ 1 million in grazing fees to the @entity86			1
@entity0 's @entity87 pointed this out to @entity3 in his interview friday , reminding him that he might want to read the @entity66 he carries in his pocket			1
the federal government owns 85 % of @entity82 's land			1
in other western states the federal government also owns large swaths of land			1
is it government overreach ? sure			0
but the way to tackle that government overreach is -- as members of @entity104 , conservative media personalities and others know very well -- to introduce legislation to fix it			2
one does n't just wake up one morning like @entity3 did and decided he 's not going to follow the laws of our land			1
there are lots of laws i do n't like -- most notably paying taxes -- but i follow them because i do n't want to go to jail			0
as @entity86 rangers tried to confiscate @entity3 's 500 cattle for his disobeying the law , @entity3 joined about 50 other supporters , many of whom were armed with guns and refused to yield			1
and conservatives like @entity125 and sen. @entity126 cheered him on in his defiance			0
then @entity3 reveals himself as a racist			2
the entire @entity130 affair just makes the @entity21 look bad			0
are all @entity21 racist ? absolutely not			0
but many overwhelming came out in support of this lunatic			0
i think it 's an awful day for conservatives			2
i think we need serious reflection because we 're not going to win 2016 with this attitude , keep doing things the same old way			0
we have old white men saying offensive things to women and minorities , and i 'm tired of it			0
at a time when the @entity21 needs to bring more minorities into our tent -- along with women for that matter -- embracing fools like @entity3 does n't help and certainly will put us farther down the path of losing in 2016			2
i 've said it over the past five years , but it continues to fall on deaf ears : the @entity21 at all levels from political organizations to offices of members of @entity104 needs to do a better job hiring blacks			0
not to do " black or minority outreach " but to do the same jobs your white staffers are doing			0
maybe if the @entity21 would stop treating blacks as " others " and really give us a seat at the table , it would stop acting like the stupid party and start winning presidential elections again			0
but , sadly , i wo n't hold my breath			0
join us on @entity175 / @entity174 .			0
