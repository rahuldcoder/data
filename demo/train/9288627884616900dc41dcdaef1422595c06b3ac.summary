a lot has changed since @entity1 made its debut 11 years ago			1
younger users are n't satisfied with lengthy video calls on computers anymore			0
they want to communicate in small bites throughout the day , sending texts , selfies , gifs , emojis and " @entity11 " s from mobile devices			0
to keep up with the times , @entity1 launched the ephemeral messaging app @entity15 on tuesday			1
the free app sticks to @entity1 's video roots while borrowing heavily from the @entity19 playbook			1
the standalone app lets you send videos up to 42 seconds long to a single person or a group			1
they can then respond by recording another video clip or with a prerecorded five - second video			0
the clips in the resulting back - and - forth " conversations " can be replayed for up to two weeks , at which point they disappear			2
video clips ca n't be shared outside the app , and if someone deletes a video they sent , it will disappear from the recipient 's app as well			1
to make it simple , the app , available for @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , does n't require users to sign in with any account			0
it just uses their phone number and then looks for contacts in their address book			0
@entity1 's video calls are still hugely popular , but mobile devices have upended how people communicate			1
more than half of @entity1 's new users every month sign up from smartphones and tablets , and during the day , there are times when more people are using @entity1 on a mobile device than on a desktop or laptop			1
the company , which was purchased by @entity65 in 2011 , is competing against social networks and an assortment of messaging apps			0
they include @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity19 and @entity73 , as well as traditional texts and instant message apps			2
" there 's a different social contract to how we communicate these days , " said @entity76 , @entity15 's principal program manager			1
" it 's really changing behavior , where you 're not worried if the person on the other end is available to talk to you			0
" most recently , there 's been a rise in ephemeral messaging , in which photos and words automatically delete after they 're viewed			1
@entity19 may have popularized the trend , but the desire to have communications that are n't archived forever echoes the real world			2
" i would n't want somebody recording every conversation i have in a bar , " @entity76 said			0
the company thinks that not saving everything will help some people loosen up and become more comfortable with asynchronous video conversations			1
" we did n't want people worrying about having to look perfect on camera or that a message recorded might be taken out of context later , " @entity76 said			0
apps that automatically delete messages can give a false sense of privacy			0
@entity1 is careful to avoid selling its new product as a security tool , like more security - minded competitors @entity114 and @entity115			2
that might be a smart move after recent news that more than 100,000 @entity19 photos were intercepted and leaked			2
@entity15 's creators say it is n't meant as a high - security method for holding important conversations			1
" the goal of the app was n't to have this super-private , super-secure communication , " @entity76 said			0
" it 's for having casual conversations			0

@entity15 is a new messaging app from @entity1 that lets people communicate with video clips
like @entity19 , the clips eventually delete , so there 's no archive of conversations
this is @entity1 's first standalone *spinoff* app
