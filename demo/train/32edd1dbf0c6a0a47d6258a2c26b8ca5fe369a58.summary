-- it would be easy for someone with @entity5 ' commercial and critical success to keep making albums that sound the same			1
in this millennium , where platinum ( million - copy - selling ) cds are increasingly rare , each of her first four solo efforts has reached that lofty sales level , according to the @entity15			2
@entity17 ' 2002 debut , " @entity18 , " reigns as a diamond ( 10 million copies ) selling album , a feat that may not be revisited often these days , with cd sales lagging			1
@entity17 ' newest cd , " @entity24 , " debuted at no. 2 on the @entity26 chart last month , making the singer five for five when it comes to her albums reaching the top three			1
but @entity17 has n't played it safe in recent years , taking serious stylistic detours			1
@entity26 named her its jazz artist of the decade for 2000 to 2009			1
but she has a history of diverse collaborations , including some with decidely non-jazz artists including the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			2
in 2012 , @entity17 has released an album with her country - tinged side project , the @entity44 , and her latest solo effort is a collaboration with a man best known for his hip - hop beats , @entity47			1
" i definitely do n't make music based on other people 's opinions or expectations , because i think that would be kind of weird , " she said , adding , " i definitely do n't want to make the same album over and over , and i do n't think i have			1
and i think if you do know everything i do , it makes a lot more sense			2
if you just know my first couple of albums , absolutely , it seems a little different			2
" @entity17 said " @entity24 " is a natural progression from her last few albums and from her work on @entity47 's " @entity68 " project last year			1
@entity17 said she and @entity47 enjoyed working together so much , she wanted to continue that relationship			1
" i asked him if he wanted to produce some songs for me that i already had written for my last album , because i was looking for sort of a different sound , and i loved working with him on the ' @entity68 ' album , " she said			2
" i knew that he had a whole different arsenal of sounds from what i was used to using			0
" he said he 'd love to work together , but he 'd rather -- the way he works best , i think , is by being there from the start of the writing process , " @entity17 continued			1
" so , that 's just totally different , because usually , i go in with songs already finished			0
and on this record , i went in with nothing , and we just wrote together , which was pretty fun , pretty different from how i 've ever worked			0
" @entity17 said she and @entity47 wrote the songs organically , picking up instruments and jamming			1
" sometimes , i would play bass , which i do n't even play , " she said			0
" but it sounded good , because he was playing drums and needed something to lock into the groove			0
sometimes , i 'd play guitar , or he would play guitar , and we 'd both switch around on guitar and keyboards			0
" many reviews of " @entity24 " have focused on the angry , wistful lyrics and vocals that seem to depict a difficult breakup			1
pointed songs such as " she 's 22 " and " @entity110 " give the album emotional heft			2
but @entity17 says people may be reading too much into the album			1
" it 's just about sort of human interactions , which we all kind of go through			0
i mean , that 's not really what we went into the studio trying to do , " she said			0
" it always feels good to write a song about an experience if you 're feeling it			0
but , it also was a lot of storytelling , you know -- a lot of writing interesting stories together			0
and once we got going , we sort of felt like there was a theme , so we just kind of kept going ( down ) that path			0
" now , @entity17 and her band are meandering through three @entity137 tour legs and two @entity139 legs through the end of october			1
they have been playing most of the new album at the earliest shows on this tour , and @entity17 says fans have been responding positively			1
" sometimes , you know , you start with a couple of new songs , and they clap , and they 're really excited , but you ca n't tell if they actually know the songs , and it can be interesting , " she said			0
" but usually , people have already been yelling out some of the new songs , which is nice			0
" days off from the job are few and far between on tour , so @entity17 and the band -- and her poodle @entity162 , to whom she dedicated the song " @entity164 " at a recent show in @entity166 -- try to make the most of life on the road , delving into local culture			1
" we definitely try to eat good local food			0
whenever we 're anywhere , the best way to do it when you do n't have a lot of time is to make sure you get a good local meal , " said @entity17 , who likes to cook when she 's back home in @entity175			2
on a recent day off in @entity184 , she and the band rented a car and went to @entity186			0
" at this point in the tour , we 're still excited and energetic , " she said			2
" you know , there 's definitely those days where you just want to stay in your hotel all day and watch movies , and those are pretty nice			0
but usually , you try to do those in cities where it 's raining or there 's not much to do			0
