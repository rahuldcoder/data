-- if every generation has a moment where they adopt a rose - colored perspective of the people and pop culture of its past , the 20 - somethings had their turn in 2011			2
those who came of age in the ' 80s and ' 90s now span the demographic that 's exiting college or creeping into their 30s			1
as they do so , various cultural outlets are recreating or referencing the tv shows , movies , fashion and music on which they were raised			0
this year , we were reacquainted with the staccato giggles of the animated " @entity22 , " which returned to @entity23 after originally appearing on the network from 1993 to 1997			1
and then , in perhaps the biggest tv flashback , was @entity27 's weekly late - night block of programming , " the ' 90s are all that			1
" at the box office , 1994 's " @entity33 " was re-released in @entity32 in september , and we can now expect 1991 's " @entity35 " and 1989 's " @entity34 " to be theatrically re-released in @entity32 as well			1
it 's the same deal with @entity38 's 1997 blockbuster " @entity40 , " which will also be back in theaters in @entity32 in the spring			1
not to mention " the @entity41 " being dusted off for another theatrical jaunt this year , courtesy of " @entity45 " star @entity44 ( a series that thrives on the theme of nostalgia and looking back )			2
this year was kind to the musicians of the ' 90s , as @entity50 -- the supergroup made up of @entity52 and the @entity53 -- pulled in $ 40 million with their tour , according to the @entity55			1
and if that was n't enough , the very depiction of ' 90s whimsy , @entity58 , has added clothing to its swath of school supplies			1
of course , they 'd be remiss to not have adult sizes			0
it seems that while the kids have grown up , a lot of the culture that surrounds them has n't			1
' you sort of want to relive your youth ' " trends tend to be really cyclical , but we 're also in the @entity77 generation , and these are the people who are the most visible online and have the biggest presence , " said @entity72 , staff editor for @entity73			0
" as you come out of college and you 're looking for a job , you 're looking back at your childhood as the days when you did n't have to work and did n't have to think about a career ; that 's the perfect time to be nostalgic			1
you sort of want to relive your youth			0
" this theory could be especially applicable now , as young @entity87 are trying to navigate the murky waters of the economy and their future prospects			0
according to the @entity95 , the proportion of young adults living at home with parents has increased between 2005 and 2011 with 19 % of men ages 25 - 34 living with parents these days as compared with 14 % in 2005			0
for women , that shift went from 8 % to 10 % in the same time frame			0
it would n't be surprising if everyone wanted to go back to when @entity103 was just " blossom " instead of " @entity106 's " @entity105			1
and to that extent , " executives are capitalizing on that , " says @entity108			0
indeed , @entity111 's @entity27 launched its ' 90s programming block in response to consumer demand			1
( a tagline on its website reads : " remember when life did n't suck ? " ) @entity118 , senior vice president and general manager of @entity120 and @entity27 , recalled that it was about a year or so ago that execs first noticed the longing for programs that emerged in the early - to - mid - ' 90s such as " @entity125 , " " @entity126 , " " @entity127 " and " @entity128			1
" today 's social media calls for the 1990s " we really started to notice digitally on social media sites -- @entity77 , @entity132 , various video based sites -- that there was this chatter and noise by fans that they wanted their ' 90s @entity111 back , " @entity118 said			1
" there was even a @entity77 page that was , ' i want my ' 90s @entity111 back			1
' " coupled with an army of interns in the same age range who could " put a face " to the online fans -- which @entity118 said they estimated to be some 15 million strong -- executives at the channel decided to go with it			0
when the programming block bowed on july 25 at midnight , placed at that time period to indicate that this was for the adults who remembered the shows and not necessarily kids , it was a hit			1
ratings for that 12 a.m. -2 a.m. time period , which was on a monday , were around 500 % higher in the 18 - 34 demographic , according to a statement from the network			0
when these adults were kids , the expansive cable market we know today was just beginning to grow , and here they were at 7 , 8 , and 9 years of age with an entire network just for them , @entity118 said			2
" this ' 90s @entity111 thing -- it 's not just about the shows , " he concluded			1
" it 's about the environment , the packaging , and everything that was going on at that time			2
they view @entity111 [ of the ' 90s ] as the golden age , because they 're so deeply emotionally connected to that time period			1
" stars of yesteryear come back for second round that strong emotional tie could also explain why , as @entity183 points out , some stars of the ' 90s are getting back into the spotlight			2
( and then , you also have to acknowledge that it has n't been quite long enough for them to have fallen that far from our radar in the first place			2
) in addition to @entity103 on @entity193 ' " @entity106 , " there 's her former " @entity197 " co-star @entity194 , who has starred on @entity196 's " @entity195 " with " @entity126 " and " @entity199 " star @entity198 since 2010			2
@entity202 , he of " @entity201 " fame , is expected to appear on @entity196 's " @entity203 " in 2012 in a role that essentially has him playing himself			2
even an event such as when @entity207 turned 30 this fall can cause the @entity209 to pause long enough to have a sustained fan - girl swoon , recalling crushes on the " @entity207 " of @entity212 's ' 90s sitcom " home improvement			1
" " fans are watching these [ shows ] because they 're also remembering what they were like when they grew up watching them , " @entity108 said			0
the actors themselves are " sort of playing on that , very successfully			0
" if it seems odd that we 're wistful for that which does n't feel quite that long ago , recall that : ( a ) more than 20 years have indeed passed since 1990 , and ( b ) it could be because not a lot has changed			1
is nostalgia crimping creativity today ? " digital technology has made it so much easier to access the past			0
you can youtube almost any video , tv clip , or just the sound			0
it 's used almost as an audio library , " said @entity237 , author of " @entity238			2
" " young people today know vastly more in terms of the history of music than i would have at their age , because i could n't access it -- there were limits			2
now , you can listen to virtually anything for nothing , if you 're willing to download illegally			0
you can school yourself on the whole history of music on @entity256			0
... it 's not so much about finding new things , but about finding old things that are new to you			2
" awareness and understanding of history is not a bad thing ( far from it ) , and neither is being able to creatively use prior cultural events to help fuel new creations			0
but , @entity237 believes , our innovation seems to have comparatively slowed			0
" [ in ] previous decades in pop culture , like the ' 60s and the ' 90s , there was a lot of emphasis on the new , on looking forward to the future , on innovation and change , " he says			1
" the ' 60s was crazy for everything new and breaking tradition , and in the ' 90s there was n't that as to the extent of the ' 60s , but there was information technology and a lot of things that seemed very new			1
and , they were both periods that were relatively economically prosperous			0
" but in the past decade , he suggests that forward - thinking view " seems to have really died away in culture , except with things like phones and personal communication technology			2
i think that 's one of the reasons why people are so obsessed with @entity299 , because he was the one bringing the science fiction future into everyday life			0
" although it 's arguable that the " mash - up " or the " remix , " by which one would take references from pop culture of the past and reinterpret it for the present , is the innovation of today , @entity237 is n't buying it			1
" so much pop culture has become archived in such an accessible way , you have young people who are nostalgic for things long before they were born , " he said			0
" i think that 's a bleak view , if that 's the future , that culture will just keep recycling and recycling			1
everything will get very familiar , at a certain point			0
people can do it very creatively , but i think at a certain point , things will seem kind of stale , and people would 've seen it all before			0
" and yet , judging from the positive reaction consumers have had to the culture of their childhood being surfaced once again , having seen it all before seems to be exactly the way we want it .			0
