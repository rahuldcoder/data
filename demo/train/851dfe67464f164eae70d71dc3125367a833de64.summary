@entity0 -- the glitch - plagued rollout of president @entity5 's signature health care law has been dogged by one big question : how many people have enrolled in an insurance plan ? the @entity9 refuses to release the numbers , leading many to assume they are embarrassingly low			1
but insurance industry insiders point to another reason : nobody knows if the numbers they do have are even accurate			1
turns out , some insurance companies say they are receiving data from the administration that is incomplete , duplicative or contradictory , making it difficult to get an accurate count of new enrollment			1
opinion : why healthcare.gov has so many problems so far , most of the attention has focused on people being unable to sign up for coverage through online health care exchanges			1
but even when customers manage to make it through the enrollment process , glitches persist			2
" the administration is not wrong in saying that there 's been a lot of problems with signing up			1
but it 's incorrect to say that 's the only problem , " an insurance industry official said			2
" that 's not the only issue at hand			2
" industry officials who were contacted requested anonymity to speak candidly because of the superheated politics surrounding @entity47			0
opinion : will glitches derail @entity47 ? the sign - up process works this way : a person sets up an online account , verifies an identity , applies for coverage and subsidies and , if eligible , shops and enrolls for a plan			2
once completed , information is sent to the insurance plans selected by the user			0
at 6 p.m. each day , the government sends the latest batch of new enrollees to insurance companies			0
but sometimes that data come with conflicting information , showing for instance , someone who enrolled and then canceled a plan , said an insurance industry executive			0
other times data come in without a time stamp , making it difficult to track , the executive said			0
adding to the confusion , the executive said , is that people are not officially enrolled in a plan until they pay their first premiums , which are not due until december 15			0
that means shoppers have about two months to cancel or switch plans before making a final decision of whether or not to enroll			0
success on day 14 of @entity47 website an administration official did not dispute there have been problems with data sent by the government to insurers			1
" we know that people are enrolling in coverage and the system works			0
as individual problems are raised by insurers , we work aggressively to address them , " said @entity97 , a spokeswoman for the @entity98			1
an @entity98 official said enrollment numbers will likely be released in mid-november , giving officials time to verify their accuracy			1
former @entity5 press secretary @entity106 had harsh words for the administration , saying the october 1 rollout was " bungled badly			2
" " i hope they 're working day and night to get this done , and when they get it fixed , i hope they fire some people that were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work , " @entity106 said monday on @entity110			0
' cumbersome , glitchy ' system so far , the buzz in the insurance industry is that enrollment numbers are falling short of projections			1
one insurance company executive put it this way , " the numbers are n't as bad as the doomsday people would say			1
but so far , they 're low and they have people worried			0
