@entity0 looks set for the quarterfinals after securing its first victory at the finals of the @entity5 for 41 years with an upset 1 - 0 win over favored @entity7 wednesday			1
@entity7 , who topped @entity8 after an opening victory over @entity10 , fell victim to a @entity13 goal early in the second half and wayward finishing			1
the vital win in @entity0 's first appearance at @entity5 since 2000 leaves @entity19 's team needing just a draw from its final group game against @entity10 to reach the quarterfinals			1
@entity13 , who plays for @entity23 in the @entity25 top - flight , grabbed his goal after @entity7 failed to clear a 48th minute corner			1

@entity29 's first time volley early in the match had nearly put @entity7 into an early lead but it was turned over the crossbar by @entity38 in the @entity0 goal			1
@entity38 also made a fine save from @entity7 's star player @entity40 after a free kick , but after the break @entity0 came more into the game and deserved its victory to move onto four points after two games			1
earlier , 2013 runner - up @entity10 and host @entity48 played to a goalless draw , leaving both sides looking for victories in the final round of group matches to advance further in the 16 - team competition			1
@entity10 is left with just one point from two games and seemingly out of luck after @entity57 twice saw first half efforts strike the woodwork			2
the home side offered little in attack until after the break when @entity63 embarked on a brilliant solo run and set up @entity65 to shoot wastefully over the crossbar			0
