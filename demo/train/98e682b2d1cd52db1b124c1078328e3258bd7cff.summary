-- a new flow of oil emerged from @entity4 's damaged undersea well in the @entity5 on tuesday evening after a remote - controlled submarine successfully cut into the well 's riser pipe			1
@entity4 used robots in its latest attempt to curtail the flow of crude from the largest spill in @entity15 history , which spread to barrier islands off @entity17 and @entity18 on tuesday			1
when the robot submarines cut into the undersea well 's riser pipe , a fresh spew of oil temporarily obscured the view of the mechanical arm			2
the cut was a first step toward placing a cap over the well that has spewed hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the @entity5 every day since late april			1
@entity4 expects to make more cuts to the riser before bringing in a diamond saw to make a clean cut where the cap will be fitted			1
@entity37 , the company 's chief operating officer , told @entity0 's " @entity42 " that the procedure should collect the " vast majority " of the oil if it succeeds			2
" we 'll be putting the cap assembly , loading that out and sending it to the sea bed later tonight , " @entity37 said			0
" we should be able to install this tomorrow			0
and hopefully by late tomorrow or thursday , we should have this thing operating			0
" but the operation carries the risk that the flow of crude from the ruptured well could increase by up to 20 percent once the damaged riser is cut away			0
the job already has been complicated by pipework around the well that has had to be removed before massive metal shears could be brought to bear tuesday evening , @entity37 said			0
the gusher may not be shut down until august , when @entity4 expects to complete relief wells that will take the pressure off the one now spewing into the @entity5			1
the 5,000 - foot - deep well erupted after an explosion and fire aboard the @entity65 drilling rig on april 20			2
the rig sank two days later , taking 11 men with it and leaving up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil pouring into the @entity5 , according to federal estimates			1
after fouling sections of @entity74 's marshes over the past two weeks , the oil was spreading toward the northeast on tuesday			2
tar balls and patches of reddish - brown " weathered " oil came ashore on @entity79 , @entity17 , south of @entity80 , and on @entity18 's @entity82 , off @entity83 , authorities reported			1
oil hits @entity17 , @entity18 barrier islands more than a dozen miles offshore , researchers from the @entity87 reported seeing more rust - colored swaths of oil spattering the surface of the @entity5			1
they ranged from the size of half - dollar coins to 30 or 40 feet long , said @entity93 , the laboratory 's associate director			2
@entity4 's handling of the spill has been sharply criticized by members of @entity98 , officials in the @entity100 and the @entity102 administration , which announced tuesday that a criminal investigation of the spill was under way			1
in addition , federal officials will no longer hold joint news briefings with the company , the administration announced			0
@entity111 adm. @entity110 , the government 's point man on the spill , will now become the face of the response effort			1
@entity110 told reporters in @entity116 , @entity74 , that his job is to speak " very frankly with the @entity15 public			1
" rear adm. @entity119 , who has been the @entity111 's on - scene coordinator for five weeks , will be returning to her duties as chief of the service 's @entity116 district office			2
@entity110 praised @entity125 's work leading " an anomalous and unprecedented response " to the spill , but said @entity125 now needs to focus " on the larger array of threats " to her district -- including this summer 's @entity133 hurricane season , which began tuesday			2
in @entity74 , @entity135 president @entity134 warned that a hurricane in the area could drive more oil ashore			0
" we do n't want to scare anybody , but we need to be realistic about it , " @entity134 said			0
" if a storm does top out levees , it will probably bring oil with it			0
" he said residents who evacuate ahead of a hurricane might return " not to a flooded home , but to a home that is completely contaminated with this oil			0
" oil spill darkens hurricane fears tuesday also marked the start of the recreational fishing season for red snapper , a big draw for sport anglers in the region			1
but the season opened with a new blow to the region 's fisheries industry as the @entity165 extended its restrictions on fishing to almost a third of the @entity5			1
the closures extend southward to a point about 240 miles west of the tip of @entity172 and eastward to federal waters off the @entity17 - @entity172 state line			1
the state of @entity18 announced a closure of some of its inland waterways to fishing after oil was found in the area			1
the closed area includes areas east of 88 degrees , 40 minutes west longitude , and south of the @entity185 , but not including @entity186 and its tributaries			0
after a meeting with state attorneys general and federal prosecutors from @entity74 , @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity15 attorney general @entity188 told reporters that the @entity193 was looking at possible criminal violations in connection with the spill			1
@entity193 launches investigation " if we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be forceful in our response , " @entity188 said			2
" we have already instructed all relevant parties to preserve any documents that may shed light on the facts surrounding this disaster			0
" in a statement issued in response to @entity188 's announcement , @entity4 said it would cooperate with any inquiry , " just as we are doing in response to the other inquires that are already ongoing			1
" @entity37 told @entity0 that there have been " very few differences " between company and federal officials working to cut off the spill			0
" this is a team that 's really all aligned on the same goals and has been since the beginning , " he said			0
" the government clearly presses us very hard to make sure we 're responding as quick as we can			0
we 're moving things forward , we 're applying all the resources that we need to apply			0
but i would stress at the working level , those differences are really quite small			0
" @entity4 , rig owner @entity229 and oilfield services company @entity228 have blamed each other for the disaster			2
but @entity4 , as the well 's owner , is responsible for the costs of the cleanup under federal law , and @entity37 said the company has now spent more than $ 1 billion to clean up the oil			1
@entity4 stock has taken a beating on @entity242 , plunging on tuesday after the failure of last week 's " top kill " attempt to close the well			2
the company 's stock value is down more than a third since the spill began			0
@entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
