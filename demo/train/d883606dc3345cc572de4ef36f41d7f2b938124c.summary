-- it 's hard to imagine a more bizarre juxtaposition than @entity3 and the @entity5 regime			1
we ca n't look away and , surely , that 's part of the plan			1
@entity3 , the fantastically strange former basketball player , loves the spotlight and he knows how to draw our attention			1
he can be outrageously entertaining			0
usually , it 's all relatively harmless and inconsequential			0
but @entity3 's @entity5 visits and his avowed friendship with @entity14 , the country 's dictator -- " i love the guy , " he has said repeatedly -- have placed him in the middle of something deadly serious			1
@entity3 's trips to @entity5 , ruled by the world 's more repressive regime , bring up a moral controversy over one of the most fundamental questions faced by society , by countries , and by each human being : what is our responsibility in the face of terrible injustice and great suffering ? the dilemma was framed succinctly in biblical times : are we our brother 's keepers ? in some respects , @entity3 's interaction with @entity14 and his regime overlap with the issues we must wrestle with when we hear about the killing in @entity42 , the turmoil in the @entity44 , even the plight of the homeless in the @entity47 simply -- what , if anything , are we going to do about it ? @entity3 has come under withering criticism for befriending the young dictator			1
a member of @entity54 likened the visits to sitting down to lunch with @entity57			0
for his most recent visit @entity3 has organized an exhibition basketball game with former @entity61 players to celebrate @entity14 's birthday			1
critics say he has helped legitimize , and thus strengthen , the regime			0
@entity3 sang " @entity70 " and bowed to @entity5 's absolute ruler , behavior that no doubt will serve @entity14 's massive propaganda at home			1
even if he would rather ignore it , @entity3 rightly faces sharp questions because of the sheer brutality of the regime with which he is interacting ; because @entity14 is a big fan of his			1
because he might , just might , be able to make even a small positive difference			0
it 's hard to know precisely what @entity3 's views are on the issue of his responsibility to intercede on behalf of @entity14 's victims			1
the pressure of reflecting on the matter , of facing questions about his views and his intentions , is visibly getting to him			0
on tuesday , when @entity0 's @entity87 asked him if he planned to bring up with his @entity5 hosts the case of @entity90 -- an @entity47 imprisoned without charges for more than a year by the @entity5 regime -- he became practically incoherent with anger , declaring , cigar in hand , that he did n't " give a rat 's ass " what @entity87 thought			1
his suggestion that @entity90 is guilty of some unspecified crime makes his behavior even more reprehensible			0
@entity90 's family was dismayed			0
in a press release , his sister said , " @entity3 could do a lot of good ... but instead he has decided to hurl outrageous accusations at my brother			2
" by all appearances , @entity3 views his unique opportunity to meet with the @entity5 leader , the result of @entity14 's passion for basketball , as little more than a chance to bask in the warm limelight that has become more elusive with the passage of time			1
the complicated problems are not his concern , despite his suggestion that basketball might " open the door a little bit			0
" with him , it 's about hedonism and fame			0
@entity3 says he has no interest in the politics of @entity5			1
" whatever ( @entity14 ) does political-wise , that 's not my job			1
i 'm just an athlete			0
" saying you do n't like politics , as so many do , is a transparent excuse for inaction , for ignoring our responsibilities as human beings			2
for his part , @entity3 has done much worse than completely ignoring the suffering of the @entity5 people			1
if he had kept quiet , we might have given him the benefit of the doubt and chalked it all up to sports diplomacy , an elusive effort to thaw tensions			0
but @entity3 has gone out of his way to praise the ruler of an imprisoned , starving nation			2
not only has he showered praise on @entity14 , but he has extended it to his father and grandfather , the previous dictators who handed the country down as if it were a private family heirloom			2
" they were great leaders , " he said , adding that he is not the only one who loves the young @entity14			2
" his country likes him -- not like him , love him			0
" that 's because , as @entity3 explains , " the guy 's really awesome			1
" there is no such thing as a neutral stance on a situation like @entity5 's			1
@entity14 inherited a regime whose brutality defies belief			2
more than 150,000 people are imprisoned in a network of gulags -- camps where entire families , generations of individuals deemed a threat to @entity14 's authority , are kept in horrific conditions			1
famines have plagued the nation , killing hundreds of thousands , as resources are diverted toward the military , including the buildup of a nuclear arsenal			0
@entity14 has threatened his neighbors ( and the @entity47 ) with nuclear war and has detonated nuclear devices as recently as last year			2
we all have a responsibility to speak up , to do what we can when weak people are so clearly victimized			0
for most of us , there are limited opportunities to help , and there are many issues competing for attention			0
@entity3 , on the other hand , has a unique chance to at least try to make a difference			2
choosing to do nothing when you may have the ability to help is an even greater moral failing than ignoring a crisis when it is more difficult to intercede on behalf of the powerless			1
perhaps @entity3 will have a moment of lucidity and do something meaningful			2
perhaps he will surprise us			0
for now , behind his permanent sunglasses and shining lip rings , he is offering only weird entertainment , and an unintentional reminder that human beings have larger responsibilities			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			0

people are *captivated* by the *spectacle* of @entity3 's trip to @entity5
@entity230 : @entity3 has gone beyond just saying he is n't interested in the politics
by praising @entity14 , @entity3 *increases* his obligation to act , she says
@entity236 : choosing to do nothing when you can help suffering people is a moral failing
