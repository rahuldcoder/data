but there was speculation as well on thursday that @entity4 may be prepared to temporarily lift some visa requirements in a gesture of good will			1
the @entity13 's @entity72 newspaper quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying that @entity14 authorities would waive the need for visa applicants to produce a letter of invitation in the case of ticket holders			1

the actual specifics and fine details will be addressed in the next day or so and then we will communicate with the fans			0
" everyone recognizes in order for it to be a showcase , which it clearly will be , you have to ease entry into the country while not totally doing away with what the @entity14 authorities require			0
" but @entity112 warned that demand for tickets would leave many fans disappointed : " we could sell well over 100,000 tickets for this final , so there will be a lot of disappointed people			0
" both @entity7 and @entity8 have each received around 21,000 tickets for the match			2

" it should be a great advert for the @entity150 and for @entity0 football but it will also be the place everyone will be looking at if anything goes wrong			0
