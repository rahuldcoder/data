in an old office building at @entity3 's @entity2 in @entity4 , @entity5 , there 's a room stacked high with plastic containers of synthetic urine			2
researchers dip small white paddles into the liquid , wait for a grid of squares to change colors , and snap a photo with a custom smartphone app. it 's all part of a futuristic self - diagnosis kit from @entity20 , which is competing to be the future of @entity23 health care			1
@entity20 is one of 10 teams taking part in the @entity28 contest to create an affordable , handheld device that consumers can use to diagnose their medical conditions at home			1
the goal is to make a working version of " @entity38 's " tricorder , the television show 's fictional diagnostic device			1
in the series , the ship 's doctor would wave the portable black box over a patent 's body and immediately know if a person had broken bones , a disease or if they were going to die			0
the real - life tricorder must weigh less than 5 pounds , monitor five vital signs and detect 15 medical conditions			1
it should let people measure their own blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , oxygen saturation and respiratory rate			1
each system will be able to diagnose common health conditions including diabetes , anemia , sleep apnea and pneumonia			1
" we 're asking teams to put together an aggregation of technologies that 's never been done before , " said dr. @entity64 , the technical and medical director for the @entity28			1
" we 're spurring things to market faster , better and cheaper			0
" the multiyear contest is run by @entity28 , a nonprofit organization that attempts to accelerate major technological advances			1
last week , the judges narrowed down the field of 41 teams to 10 , which now have until april to create working prototypes for consumer tests			1
the three groups that make the most successful tricorders will split a $ 10 million prize			1
in 2005 , @entity84 's 5 - year - old son jumped out of a window and fell 36 feet to the ground			1
after a year in emergency rooms , operating rooms and the @entity89 , @entity84 had a whole new perspective on hospitals			0
he saw firsthand how powerless patients often were			0
inspired by the less invasive medical devices from science fiction , he moved to @entity95 and started @entity20			2
" ' @entity38 ' was not tv , it was a business plan , " said 57 - year - old @entity84			2
@entity20 is already close to having working prototypes of its tricorder system			2
in addition to the @entity103 ( a single - use urine test ) the company has created the @entity105 , a palm - sized disc you press to your forehead or temple for 10 seconds to take vital signs , including blood pressure , temperature , heart and respiratory rate			1
the readings are imported to a smartphone , analyzed and tracked over time			0
@entity84 's vision is to have a constant collection of data that creates a baseline for each user			0
that information will allow the @entity20 app to detect issues early , even before there are noticeable symptoms			2
these types of devices are not meant to replace doctors , but to fill in when in - person medical care is not available , affordable or necessary			1
every day , dr. @entity131 sees patients who have waited too long to seek treatment , often because they lack insurance or a primary care giver			2
there 's a steady stream of them at the @entity140 emergency room where he works , showing up days after the first symptoms of serious illnesses			2
@entity131 , who also has a ph.d. in engineering , leads the @entity28 finalist team @entity145			1
his tricorder combines a regular tablet computer with a separate @entity149 gadget that takes vitals and runs other tests			2
the companion tablet app walks the patient through the same types of questions @entity131 asks every patient who comes into his er. " it does everything you would expect a normal physician to do , " said @entity131			0
" what an @entity163 doctor does is make diagnoses			0
doing that is somewhat an art and somewhat science			0
" his team is also working on a novel approach to a neurological exam			0
using the tablet , they can test users ' vision , picking up on subtle defects caused by illness			0
for example , if a person has suffered from a hemorrhagic stroke , they might lose some vision on just one side			0
the tests could detect the issue and tell the person to seek medical help immediately , cutting down on the chance of permanent disability			2
inventing a new medical device is only the first step to getting it into the hands of real people			1
perhaps even more useful than the money is how the @entity28 is working with the @entity195			1
getting regulatory compliance for a new product is notoriously difficult and expensive , and it requires clinical trials			0
but the @entity195 is working closely with the @entity28 organization			1
the @entity28 will also manage the vigorous final tests that determine which devices will win			1
each team must produce 30 working prototypes of their tricorders for consumer testers			0
they 'll be used and reviewed by people who have one of the conditions the tricorders are required to detect			1
the final teams hail from six countries			0
they include doctors , engineers , undergrads , entrepreneurs and researchers , and all have unique approaches to the technology			0
many , like @entity105 , @entity223 and @entity225 team @entity224 , are creating small gadgets that work with existing mobile devices			1
some are taking a more traditional approach with things like blood pressure cuffs and finger pricks			0
the @entity234 team from @entity235 is working on a low - cost device worn around the neck specifically for developing countries			2
one thing they all agree on is that this technology 's time is now			0
" this device , whether it 's mine or someone else 's , is coming , " said @entity131			0
" it puts the information in the hands of the consumer where they can make actionable decisions			0
it really levels the playing field			0

contest seeks a real tricorder that can measure vital signs and detect illnesses
they are part of the $ 10 million @entity28 *challenge*
many use smartphones , tablets to create mobile self - diagnostic devices for consumers
the gadgets could give people more control over their own health care
