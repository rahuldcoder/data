former cia director @entity0 as well as some top political voices are issuing blistering responses to the @entity4 's report on torture			1
@entity0 , whose tenure over the agency was skewered in the report , fired back at the findings , growing emotional in an interview and saying he was taken out of context			1
" i think the conclusions they drew were analytically offensive and almost street - like in their simplistic language and conclusions , " he told @entity12			0
the new report says the @entity18 misled the public on its enhanced interrogation program for post- 9/11 detainees during the @entity23 era			1
it details brutal scenes of torture , harsher than what the @entity18 had disclosed in the past			2
sen. @entity29 , who steered the @entity4 investigation , blasted @entity0 in her @entity4 floor speech tuesday for providing deceptive testimony about the program to the committee when he met with them in 2007			1
@entity36 takeaways from the @entity18 torture report @entity29 said that @entity0 painted a " starkly " different picture of certain interrogations in a hearing than what committee staff members learned about those interrogations from cables			1
" ( the cables ) described brutal , around - the - clock interrogations ... in which multiple coercive techniques were used in combination and with substantial repetition , " @entity29 said on the floor			0
" it was an ugly , visceral description			0
" @entity0 , who ran the @entity18 from 2006 to 2009 , said that 's simply " untrue			1
" to back up his point , he noted that the @entity56 administration , which investigated @entity18 - detainee interrogations , did n't prosecute anyone			1
" you ca n't have all this supposed documentary evidence saying the agency mistreated these prisoners and then @entity56 's and @entity64 's @entity63 saying no , you 've got bupkus here , " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 insisted he was treated unfairly and disproportionately in the report , stressing that he became @entity18 director late in the game			1
" everything here happened before i got there [ to the @entity18 ] , and i 'm the one she [ @entity29 ] condemns on the floor of the @entity4 ? @entity74 , how 'd that happen ? " he said			2
@entity18 report 's most shocking passages " i 'm the dumb son of a b --- - who went down and tried to lay out this program in great detail to them , " he continued			1
" i 'm mentioned twice as much in there as [ former cia director ] @entity84 â € ” but @entity23 and [ former cia director ] @entity86 had 97 detainees during their tenure , while i had two			0
" he said statements he made about the program 's later days -- when the interrogation system was better regulated and more finely tuned -- were applied to the earlier days of the program when he was n't in charge			0
" it misrepresents what i said , " he said			0
@entity97 on torture report release : ' we want to be prepared ' " i would never lie to the committee , " he also said in the interview			2
" i did not lie			0
" former @entity103 sen. @entity102 of @entity104 , who previously served on the intelligence committee , argued that his former colleagues were part of a partisan effort			1
democrats , he wrote in an op - ed for @entity113 , " started out with the premise that the @entity18 was guilty and then worked to prove it			2
" he hammered the committee for relying on documents rather than interviews during the investigation and said the " most significant missed opportunity " was the fact that the report included no recommendations			2
" no one would claim the program was perfect or without its problems			0
but equally , no one with real experience would claim it was the completely ineffective and superfluous effort this report alleges			0
" republicans on the @entity4 committee also defended the @entity18 , releasing a rebuttal tuesday that questioned the methodology of the @entity4 five - year - long probe			1
their statement said the report created the " false impression that the @entity18 was actively misleading policy makers and impeding the counterterrorism efforts of other federal government agencies during the @entity140 's operation			1
" sen. @entity141 , @entity143 - @entity142 , said he understands why torture was used on detainees and argued that @entity147 officers are n't the bad guys			2
" at the end of the day , i 'm trying to distinguish ourselves from our enemies , " he said tuesday on @entity149			0
" they crucify people , they rape women , they sell them into slavery , they will kill people 's children before their eyes			0
" the techniques in question that were analyzed in the report were used to prevent another 9/11 , @entity141 said			0
" when you roll up some of these guys , you 're very anxious to get out of them whatever you can to prevent the next attack , " he continued			0
" i understand why people did this			0

former @entity18 chief @entity0 is " upset " about the report 's methodology
