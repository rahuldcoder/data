-- threats from @entity5 operatives in @entity6 increased in recent weeks and were a reason @entity6 and the @entity2 partnered in drone strikes and counterterrorism operations over the last several days , @entity2 officials told @entity0			1
" there is an increased threat stream , " said one senior @entity2 official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity			1
@entity0 has learned the @entity2 believes there is intelligence potentially indicating specific targets in @entity6 , including the @entity2 embassy there			2
other possible targets include @entity20 , as kidnap victims , and @entity6 government and military installations			2
although several officials stressed the @entity18 in @entity6 is a constant target for terrorists , one @entity2 source familiar with the latest information said at least one threat against the embassy was disrupted recently			2
a separate @entity2 official was not aware of a recent specific threat on that embassy			1
the rise in threats from @entity35 -- known as @entity35 -- continues , the sources said			0
the uptick is of particular interest to @entity2 officials because it comes after a significant effort last year to disrupt a direct threat to the @entity18 in @entity6 , as well as other @entity2 embassies , which led to several of them being closed around the world			2
since the 2013 disruption and subsequent leaks to the news media about how @entity35 communicates , the group has significantly cut back on its electronic communications , making it extremely difficult for authorities to track it , a separate @entity2 official said			1
" we have much less vision about what they are doing			0
we 're not totally blind , but we are not 20/20			0
we 're not even anywhere near 20/20 , " said the official			0
sources emphasized the recent counterterrorism operation had been planned for weeks and was part of a broader effort to disrupt @entity35			0
at least 65 suspected terrorists were killed in assaults from both the ground and sky in southern @entity6 this week			1
many suspected @entity5 militants , who survived the strikes in @entity67 province , are fleeing toward @entity68 in the south central part of the country , a town that could fall under the control of @entity5 , according to a senior @entity6 government official			1
there is a lack of government and army presence in that area , that official said			0
the two military brigades currently in southern @entity85 province , which includes @entity86 , " ca n't try to follow those militants on the move and are preoccupied with securing the ( liquefied natural gas ) facilities , " the official said			0
the official added that @entity6 authorities are on high alert and expecting " imminent retaliatory attacks " from @entity35			1
@entity0 's @entity90 and @entity91 contributed to this report .			0
