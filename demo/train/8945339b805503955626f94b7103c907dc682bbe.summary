-- the term " software engineer " conjures images of pasty - faced young men with poor posture and limited social skills			2
and people think fashion models are all beauty and no brains			1
at least , those are the stereotypes			2
so what will the world make of @entity14 , a model for @entity16 and @entity17 , who spends her spare time building mobile apps ? the 29 - year - old has appeared in major magazines like @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , but seems more proud of getting her @entity26 and @entity27 apps approved by @entity28			1
" with modeling , you never have control over anything , " @entity29 told @entity0			1
" so being able to have complete power with these apps i develop is very fulfilling			2
" @entity29 has built several apps for @entity39 platforms			1
two are currently sold in the @entity40 , and she 's preparing to release a social networking app in coming weeks			2
before the self - taught programmer began modeling for high - end designers like @entity45 , @entity16 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , she was an undiscovered @entity49 teen who loved playing calculator games			1
in high school , she taught herself the software documentation and quickly learned how to program on her @entity53			2
" i did n't realize i was even coding at that point , " @entity29 said			1
" i first got into it just to make fun games and entertain myself			0
" her game - coding skills did n't score her many points with her classmates , however			0
the 5 - foot - 9 - inch model said she was a late bloomer and that growing up " is still hard to talk about " because of the bullying and taunting she endured			0
" it got so bad in high school i could n't even look people in the face , " @entity29 said			1
" i would hide out in school so i would n't have to eat lunch in the cafeteria or see people in between classes			2
" at @entity72 , @entity29 learned coding languages @entity73 , @entity75 and @entity76 while majoring in theater and computer science			1
but instead of pursuing a programming career , she plunged into modeling			0
she got her big modeling break in 2009 when she became the first african - american to land an exclusive contract with @entity85 for @entity86			1
" it happened at a time when there was no interest in me as a model , " she said			0
" i always dreamed of it , but i was n't expecting it at all			0
" that same year @entity29 was chosen for one of the year 's most coveted fashion shows : @entity17			1
she said she was " shocked and honored " to join a lineup of supermodels including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
meanwhile , she continued challenging expectations by teaching herself how to program @entity103 and @entity104 " i think a lot of models thought i was strange having a computer on my lap in the middle of a casting line , " @entity29 said			1
" i never really talked about programming in the modeling business			0
i kept the worlds very divided			0
" @entity29 's first @entity39 app was a charity - based project aimed at helping young scholars in @entity117			1
the app , educate ! , finds sponsors for @entity117 students and guides them toward becoming leaders and entrepreneurs			0
" i learned about @entity123 ! in college			2
it was an organization founded by two @entity127 students			0
when i found out that @entity117 has the youngest population in the world and the highest youth poverty rate , i wanted to get involved , " she said			0
" it was rejected ( by @entity28 ) a few times			0
i had a big battle with @entity28 , going back and forth , so it was a huge relief when it finally passed			0
" she has since developed several more applications , including @entity136 , which helps models and other creative types organize their professional portfolios on an @entity27			2
" i noticed so many models were using @entity27 to show casting directors their work , but it looked messy and did n't have a nice interface , " @entity29 said			1
" so i made @entity136 as similar functionally as an actual portfolio but much more convenient			0
" her brother , @entity146 , is one of her biggest fans			0
" @entity14 is a mix of @entity150 and @entity151 ( @entity152 ) , " said @entity29			1
" she combines her passion for modeling and passion of coding to help improve our world			0
" last month , @entity29 visited a middle school in @entity161 's @entity160 neighborhood to speak with students interested in computer programming			1
" we have this idea of people in technology being and looking a certain way , " she said			1
" that stereotype is destructive , and i think that 's part of the reason why female and minority programmers are so few			0
" @entity29 said computer coding has now become a second professional life for her			1
she has plans for many more apps , and wants to learn coding for @entity179 as well			2
the young dual - career woman would never have called herself a nerd while growing up because she saw it as a hurtful word at the time			0
" but now that i 'm older , if it means being smart and having interests like computer science , then i have no problem being a nerd , " she said .			1
