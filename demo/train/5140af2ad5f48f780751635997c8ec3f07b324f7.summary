@entity0 -- a fugitive gunman thought to be behind a string of armed robberies and murders in @entity6 dating back to 2004 has been shot and killed following a huge manhunt			1
@entity11 -- one of the country 's most wanted criminals -- was killed by police in the southwestern city of @entity16 on tuesday morning , the state - run @entity9 news agency reported			1
described as " ruthless and highly dangerous " by @entity6 authorities , @entity11 became infamous for robbing people while they were drawing money from banks and repeatedly dodging police manhunts			2
thousands of police and soldiers were drafted in over the weekend to search for the 42 year old after a woman was shot dead and two others injured on friday outside a bank in @entity16 during an attempted robbery , @entity9 said			1
later that day , local police reported that a railway policeman was killed while in pursuit of a man believed to be @entity11 -- his ninth victim in eight years following a series of robberies in @entity16 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
all his victims were shot in the head , according to media reports			0
