a 62 - year - old evacuee from @entity1 made a brief visit to his radiation - contaminated home , walked to his shuttered shop , and then hanged himself in a storage space			1
the death is yet another sad reminder how the march 11 , 2011 , disaster in @entity10 continues to claim victims			0
on that day , a magnitude - 9 earthquake triggered a tsunami which swamped the @entity15 plant , knocking out power to cooling systems and leading to meltdowns in its three operating reactors			0
the earthquake and tsunami left more than 15,000 dead			2
while no deaths have been directly attributed to the nuclear disaster , the resulting release of radioactivity forced residents of several towns near the plant to flee their homes , and a 20 - kilometer ( 12.5 - mile ) zone around the plant remains closed to the public			0
the man , who was not named by police , was one of tens of thousands who were evacuated from the area			1
he and his wife were briefly granted entry into the exclusion zone around the plant on sunday , to visit their home and their small store , police said			1
after the wife reported him missing , officers and volunteer firefighters in the town of @entity48 organized a search , police said			1
the following day , firefighters found the man 's body in his store 's storage shed			1
@entity57 , a local government spokesman and a friend of the victim , told @entity60 that when he heard the reports that the man was missing , he feared the man had killed himself			2
" there are so many people ( in my town ) who have lost hope			1
this affects their health , " he said			0
@entity57 , an evacuee himself , expressed frustration over the plight of the 70,000 evacuees of the nuclear disaster and the governmental paralysis in caring for the people of his town			1
@entity57 pointed the finger at the national government , saying @entity82 's leaders just want to get the town to accept radiation - contaminated debris on an interim basis , without offering any long - term plan to manage all the evacuees			2
the evacuees have yet to receive any sizable compensation or a timetable on when , or if , they 'll ever be able to return to their homes , he said			0
" the people of @entity48 are increasingly depressed about the future			0
we do n't have a clear future or see any achievable targets , " said @entity57			0
he said he knew of four or five people in @entity48 who had committed suicide and more than 100 who had died of illness during the evacuation			2
@entity10 media reported the man complained of insomnia from the stress of the evacuation and his inability to make a living .			0
