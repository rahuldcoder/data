-- coming from a company known more for its plasma hdtvs , the @entity1 is a pleasant surprise in the 32 - inch lcd category			1
attractively designed and well appointed with generous connectivity , it is also a good performer overall , although by no means perfect			1
i was particularly impressed with the set 's color accuracy , which is something i really do n't expect from entry - level displays			1
compared with the competition , the @entity12 represents a compelling value in small lcd screens when you consider its performance characteristics			2
design basic in its design , but simultaneously elegant - looking , the @entity18 has a glossy black finish , with a 3 - inch - wide bezel surrounding the screen on all sides			1
it is a small and unobtrusive television that will fit into just about any decor nicely			2
side panel av inputs are neatly tucked away behind the right side of the screen			2
the remote control is identical to @entity1 's current plasma line of hdtvs , with an excellent ergonomic design			1
it is on the large side , but slender enough to fit in the hand comfortably			0
unfortunately , the remote is not backlit			0
the internal menu graphical user interface is also quite simple and intuitive to use and navigate			0
features the @entity40 's offers a fairly comprehensive feature package for an entry - level 32 - inch lcd tv			1
its native resolution is 1366x768 , or around 720p , whereas many higher - end models have a 1080p native resolution			1
at this screen size , however , the benefits of 1080p resolution are nearly impossible to discern with moving video , whether standard - or high - definition			1
if you plan on regularly using your 32 - inch lcd tv as a computer monitor , however , you might want to consider a 1080p model			1
picture adjustment options are ok , but not as extensive as found on the @entity57 or @entity58 for example			2
preset picture modes include cinema , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65			0
custom can be adjusted independently per input while the others can be tweaked as well and apply to every input			0
selectable color temperatures include @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73			0
the @entity75 feature may be the most important in terms of optimizing the panel 's picture , as it helps it achieve reasonably deep black levels when lowered from its factory setting			2
some dubious picture - adjusting features include @entity82 and @entity83 , both of which should be shut off for optimum performance			2
@entity83 is an auto - contrast feature that raises and lowers the light output of the panel depending on ambient room lighting			0
this ultimately makes black and white level a moving target , and both of these parameters really should remain constant			0
in the advanced menu there are two varieties of noise reduction , called @entity100 and @entity101 , and for high - quality sources both should be turned - off			2
@entity104 should be set to @entity105 for full shadow detail , although intuitively i would think @entity108 would be correct			0
( @entity1 always had @entity109 and darker settings that were intuitively correct at 7.5 and 0 ire respectively in their dvd players			2
strangely , for their tvs , it is backward			0
) connection options are generous enough on the @entity1 , although unlike most other small - screen flat - panel sets it lacks a vga - style pc input			1
the rear panel does have two hdmi inputs , one component video input , one @entity125 input with a choice of either composite or @entity127 , and one @entity129 input			0
one set of analog audio outputs , and one digital optical audio output for routing sound to an external av receiver are also on tap			0
side panel inputs include one @entity137 , and one set of @entity125 inputs with composite video only , and an sd card slot on the right side of the panel for viewing your digital photos			0
we 'd like to see a headphone jack on the side as well , but no dice			0
performance the @entity151 is one of the better performers at its size in the entry - level , 720p - resolution lcd category			1
color accuracy and black level performance are its main strengths , while color decoding and standard - definition processing are not			1
i did n't have to make too many adjustments during the user menu calibration to get the little tv looking its best			0
since there are no custom color temperature controls in the user menu , i simply chose the best picture mode ( @entity63 ) and color temperature preset ( @entity71 ) and then tweaked the remainder of the basic picture controls			0
afterward i was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of the grayscale ; you can click here to access my full picture settings			0
for my comparison i looked at the @entity1 alongside the @entity180 , the @entity181 and the @entity182 , two lcds and a 32 - inch plasma respectively			1
black level : blacks are reasonably good for an inexpensive lcd flat - panel tv , and deeper than either the @entity180 or the @entity182 , although not quite as deep as the @entity181			1
the @entity1 also delivers the blacker - than - black video signals that many more expensive displays can not , which helps lead to improved shadow detail			1
chapter two of " x-men : @entity194 " showed off the @entity12 's compelling blacks very nicely			0
this high - contrast scene takes place at night , with bright explosions going off to provide a good look at an hdtv 's shadow detail capability			1
there was plenty of fine detail in the background dark areas of the picture			0
the black areas of the picture were deep , rich , and inky , and the scene was relatively free of low - level noise			1
color accuracy : as you can see from the @entity212 , grayscale tracking in the warm color temperature preset was impressive , and the primary colors of red , green , and blue also measured reasonably close to the hdtv standard , which is unusual even in some expensive flat - panel displays			1
color decoding does push red a bit though , so we had to desaturate the color somewhat and remove some of the picture 's punch			2
colors still appeared vibrant , however , and skin tones looked quite natural			0
chapter four of the awesome transfer of " @entity236 " proved an excellent scene to show off the @entity1 's contrast ratio -- good blacks and whites creating a snappy picture -- as well as its accurate color reproduction			1
video processing : unlike most modern hdtvs the @entity12 does n't accept 1080p sources , so my evaluation had to be with all hd sources set to 1080i			0
the set lacks an aspect ratio that provides for zero overscan , which would be a bigger issue if it were a 1080p resolution panel , but really is n't a big deal the panel has only a 720p resolution			2
the video processing does roll off the high - frequency video somewhat , a common flaw with many flat - panel sets on the market today			0
uniformity : white - field uniformity was reasonably good on this panel , and that is saying something for an lcd			1
as you may know lcd display technologies , whether flat panel or projection , suffer from poor white - field uniformity			2
as a result you may see red and blue splotches in scenes that are primarily white like the ice in a hockey game or a movie like " @entity271			0
" this @entity1 , while not perfect , was better than most in this performance test			2
standard - definition : the @entity1 is a mediocre performer with standard - def material			1
it did n't resolve every line of horizontal resolution according to the charts on the @entity280 disc , and as a result some images appeared a bit softer than normal			1
it did a below - average job of smoothing out jaggies on rotating diagonal lines , and there were a good number of such artifacts in a waving @entity291 flag			2
the set 's noise reduction , on the other hand , was very good at cleaning up moving motes in low - quality images of skies and sunsets , and the set engaged 2:3 pull - down detection quickly and effectively			1
pc : absent a vga - style @entity301 input i attempted to test the @entity1 's capability to handle digital signals from a pc via its @entity137 jack			1
the best resolution the video card allowed was 1,280x768 , which is short of the set 's native resolution , and there was enough overscan that important areas of the screen , including the @entity317 taskbar , were obscured			1
people who want a pc display should probably choose another set			0

as a 32 - inch lcd tv , the @entity1 is a good overall performer
it 's one of the better models at its size in the entry - level , 720p - resolution category
model delivers surprisingly impressive hd picture quality for a small - screen lcd
but standard - def images look softer than normal
