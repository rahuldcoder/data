the bill passed on a 30 - 1 vote in the @entity12 and a 62 - 0 vote in the @entity1 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity14			0
corrections officials entered into the settlement with @entity18 , the station said			1
@entity18 vanished in 1991 at the age of 11			0
she was found in august 2009 , living in a shed in the @entity21 , @entity22 , backyard of @entity3 , a registered sex offender who had been on parole since january 1988			1
investigators say @entity26 fathered two children with @entity18 during her captivity			0
he and his wife , @entity30 , are charged with 29 felony counts in the case			0
both have pleaded not guilty			0
in a report issued in november , the state inspector general 's office found the state @entity6 failed to properly keep tabs on @entity26 or properly supervise the officers assigned to his case			1
" while it is true that @entity26 's @entity22 parole was never officially violated , our review shows that @entity26 committed numerous parole violations and that the department failed to properly supervise @entity26 and missed numerous opportunities to discover his victims , " the report said			1
parole officers failed to investigate utility wires running from @entity26 's house toward the shed where @entity18 was held , to check out the presence of a 12 - year - old girl during a visit or to act on information the report said " clearly " showed @entity26 had violated the terms of his release , the report said			1
@entity18 , who is now 30 , her mother and her daughters had filed a claim saying state corrections officials failed to do their jobs , seeking psychological , physical and emotional damages , @entity14 said			0
the settlement process was " pretty much unprecedented , " said @entity73 , spokesman for assemblyman @entity74 , who sponsored the bill			1
the language was inserted into a bill concerning claims against the state			0
@entity74 is chairman of the @entity1 's @entity80 , @entity73 said			1
every year as part of the budget process , the chair submits two bills for judgments against the state , @entity73 said			2
it was decided that this would be the quickest way to get it through the @entity1 , he said			0
officials thought the state might have a case if it fought @entity18 's claim , but it was n't worth the case going to a jury , @entity73 said			2
because the constitutional deadline for an approved state budget has passed and @entity22 is in a new fiscal year without a budget , no appropriations can be made without gov. @entity99 's consent			1
@entity99 has to request the bill be moved to his desk to sign it , @entity73 said			1
@entity26 was paroled in august 1988 after serving 11 years of a federal kidnapping sentence			2
he also served a five - year term in @entity105 for rape charges			0
the november report from @entity22 inspector - general @entity108 was limited to reviewing the actions of state parole officers in charge of monitoring @entity26 from june 1999 until @entity18 and her children were discovered			0
but @entity26 was under the supervision of federal parole officers when authorities say he kidnapped @entity18 in 1991 , and they also " failed to detect @entity26 's criminal conduct and his victims , " the report says			2
@entity26 was only " properly supervised " for 12 out of the 123 months he was under @entity22 's supervision , " a failure rate of about 90 percent , " @entity108 told reporters in november			2
@entity0 's @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report .			0
