human construction projects are generally centrally planned , with people in leadership roles supervising how everything is put together , and builders aware of the overall progress			0
but termites and other animals go about building in a different way , working independently			1
each termite reacts directly to what it encounters , rather than having a preconceived notion of what to do			0
collectively , the insects can create a mound much larger than themselves			0
" they do all of their coordination indirectly , by changing their shared environment , " says @entity16 of the @entity17 at @entity18			1
@entity16 and colleagues used this model of decentralized , reactive building to create robots operating under those principles			1
robots that behave this way could be useful for construction projects that would be too dangerous for humans , such as underwater research stations or in outer space			1
another possible application would be building levees out of sandbags in flood zones , @entity16 said			0
" if you had a robot system to handle that kind of building automatically , that would let you keep people out of harm 's way , " @entity16 said			0
the findings are published in the journal @entity48 and presented at the @entity49 meeting this week			0
these robots are small -- 4.7 inches high , with a footprint of about 4 x 7 inches			1
the " bricks " that they can manipulate , made of expanded urethane foam , are bigger than these critters : 8.5 x 8.5 x 2 inches			0
researchers created algorithms governing the behavior of the robots , so that they know what to do when they encounter specific situations			1
it 's not the blueprint that guides the robots , but rather these predefined simple rules			1
the construction begins with a single " seed " brick in a particular location			0
the robots can move forward , backward and turn in place			1
they were designed to be able to climb up or down a step that is the height of one brick and build staircases with the bricks to get themselves higher up			2
importantly , these robots only detect bricks and other robots that are in their immediate area ; they have no idea how far along the overall structure is or what more distant robots are doing			1
watch a @entity88 video of the robots in action " robots obtain information about where bricks have been attached only through direct inspection , " researchers wrote			2
the design of the robots in this research was n't intended to be " cute , " although they may appear that way -- some researchers call them " frog - bots " or " squirrel - bots , " said @entity105 , a co-author on the study			1
they have rounded features for the sake of simplicity and using less material			0
the robots have four types of sensors , @entity105 said			2
a pattern - recognition system , composed of seven infrared sensors , can detect black and white patterns on the bricks and helps with navigation			2
in addition to tactile sensing , the robots have a pattern recognition system , an accelerometer to sense tilt , and five ultrasound sonar units to detect other robots and help maintain distance from the perimeter of the structure			2
to move around , the robots have wheel - legs called " whegs			1
" this study did not optimize the robots for speed			2
it took three robots half an hour to build a " trident " structure with eight blocks , @entity105 said			1
a decentralized system of robots has some advantages over a centrally planned method of building			2
if individuals perish , the plan does n't fall apart , because it does n't depend on how many builders there are			0
when everything is planned out , you 'd have to go back to the drawing board if some of the robot builders bit the dust			0
but a decentralized system readily adapts to the loss of participants , @entity16 said , just like what happens in nature with termites			0
" if half the colony gets eaten by an aardvark , the rest can carry on , " he said			0
there are still some engineering challenges that would need to be solved to ramp this up to large - scale projects on @entity171 , the study said , but @entity16 said it 's conceivable that designing robot systems such as these for disaster zones would in the realm of years away , @entity16 said			1
for more extreme environments such as other planets , scaling these kinds of robots up to the task might take decades , @entity16 said			0
but conceivably the principle of this study could be applied to send robots to build a base on @entity186			1
if they build it , maybe we will come .			0

small robots can behave like termites to build structures
the idea might be applied to send robots to space
these robots have wheel - legs called " whegs "
