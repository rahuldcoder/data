@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is on a mission as he shows a small group of journalists around his workplace			1
the manager of the @entity9 and his colleagues are bent on dispelling rumors about the condition of their facility : rumors about a meltdown , about a loss of power			0
the rumors are patently false , they say , and it 's frustrating to have to deal with them while also battling a genuine crisis			0
these officials are also acutely aware of comparisons to the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in @entity26 in march , which crippled a nuclear power plant there , leading to the worst nuclear accident since @entity31 in 1986			1
" there 's no likelihood of a @entity35 - like incident here , " @entity3 says			1
so does @entity37 , ceo of the @entity0 plant			1
" it is not another @entity35			1
the difference is the rapid flooding that occurred at @entity35			1
this was a predicted event , to a degree , from the @entity45			0
the floodwaters at @entity0 are outside the plant			1
there is no water inside the plant			1
the reactor is covered with borated water			2
the spent fuel is covered with borated water , which we want it to be			2
that 's where it should be			0
the floodwaters are outside @entity0 , not inside , " @entity37 explains			1
still , there is a genuine crisis at the plant			2
floodwaters from the swollen @entity65 have engulfed this facility			2
the parking lots are underwater			0
the river 's fast - paced currents are swirling against several buildings in this compound			2
catwalks had to be constructed to allow workers to move from one building to the next			0
the buildings housing the reactor core , the spent fuel rods and other crucial components are protected by small levees and aqua - berms			2
but outside those barriers , the water is at least 2 feet above ground level			2
officials are keeping a close eye on the network of power transformers here			2
the transformers are surrounded by floodwater and high - velocity pumps are continually pumping water away from them			1
the transformers power internal pumps , which operate cooling systems keeping the reactor core and the spent fuel rods from overheating			0
" maintaining electrical power , operating the pumps , is our biggest concern for the station , and we 're able to fully do that at this time , " @entity3 says			0
officials say the plant went off the power grid temporarily on sunday and was powered by backup generators , but they say it is now back on the grid			1
the @entity0 plant has been offline since early april for a re-fueling operation			1
it was scheduled to be back online in mid-june , according to officials here , but the flooding has delayed that			2
now , they anticipate the plant will remain offline through the month of august , until the floodwaters completely recede			1
" what 's keeping me up at night is making sure that we 're going to have electricity for everybody , " says @entity37			0
" electricity is so important to ... the mitigation efforts of our whole community			0
it 'll continue to be safe			0
" gates and his colleagues say the water has not breached the buildings housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods , and they 're confident it wo n't			1
those buildings and the barriers protecting them are designed to withstand flooding extending 1,014 feet above sea level			0
the water is now at about 1,006 feet , and they say they do not expect it to exceed 1,008 feet			0
officials did not allow journalists directly into the rooms housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods , but did allow them to view those rooms via closed - circuit cameras			0
the rooms did not appear to be damaged by floodwater			0
@entity37 says the @entity153 cited the @entity0 plant in 2009 for not being adequately prepared for a flooding event			1
since that time , he says , they 've taken steps to upgrade safeguards for the facility , and he says @entity153 officials were satisfied with the handling of the current flooding			0
still , @entity153 chairman @entity163 had solemn words for the staff of @entity0 after touring the plant on monday			1
" in the end , " @entity163 said , " this challenge is yours			0

the @entity0 nuclear plant is surrounded by floodwaters
*unlike* the @entity35 nuclear plant , the water has n't breached vital buildings
@entity0 officials say the situation is under control
