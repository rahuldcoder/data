-- a @entity2 entrepreneur is trying to end poverty in @entity4 through microcredit -- funding @entity4 businesses by connecting them with investors from around the world			1
@entity9 is the co-founder of @entity10 , a web - based marketplace that lets investors bid to provide loans to small and medium - sized @entity4 businesses			1
bidders compete in an online auction , with those offering money at the lowest interest rates financing the loan			2
typically , around 50 investors will part fund a single loan			0
all the businesses applying for a loan have been vetted and judged to have good growth prospects			2
@entity10 says the model gives @entity4 entrepreneurs access to credit at low interest rates , while allowing lenders to make a profit from the interest			1
it 's a system @entity10 claims can help eradicate poverty in @entity4 by building its economies from the bottom up			1
over 18,000 investors from 107 countries have so far invested more than € 12 million in 6,346 @entity4 businesses , according to @entity10			1
@entity9 discussed his business - oriented approach to fighting poverty with @entity0 's @entity42			1
@entity0 : in terms of where you got the idea from , what were the needs you discovered ? @entity9 : six years ago , i met the other co-founder @entity50 ( @entity51 ) in a cab in @entity53 by coincidence and he had been working the last two decades within and for @entity4 , whereas i had n't			1
we actually got inspired by how we can help @entity4 -- we read everywhere that @entity4 is growing , the gdp growing 5 % a year , but actually the access directly to these small and medium - sized enterprises is hard , so we said " could we create an infrastructure that was investing directly in @entity4 entrepreneurs ? " we will have a completely different story -- it 's not about waiting for the @entity63 and others to save the world , it is about you and i having a tool at our fingertips to be able to help and save the world , make it a better world			1
@entity0 : so we get the story of someone that is looking for some finance and then you can offer a loan			0
explain how that works through the site			2
tv : round numbers -- an entrepreneur is looking for € 1,000 , we 're 10 people each with € 100 and we go in and bid			0
there 's a @entity86 auction -- so you come with a very attractive offer of 3 % , i 'm trying to optimize my bid and come with a 28 % and altogether the average weighted interest is that it fulfills the borrower 's need -- and then person number 11 comes in and says , " @entity9 , you are too expensive , " and kicks me out with a lower interest rate and i can come back into the auction			2
@entity0 : so someone with some money can offer a loan and the one with the cheapest rate at the end gets to give the loan			0
tv : yes , not just one , there could be several			0
we 've seen loans with one lender , we 've also seen several hundred lenders within each loan			0
@entity0 : and how do we know a borrower is n't using some of the money that your businesses lent him on a project which is n't the project that you think you are investing in ? tv : we have providers which are our partners in @entity4 , financial institutions , that are doing the vetting of the business , looking at their business plan -- can they repay ? do they have the ability ? also we run spot checks , ensuring that the loan they are asking for is also used for the business growth			1
@entity0 : how do i know that is safe ? because you are not a bank , so you are not regulated like a bank			0
where does the regulation come from ? tv : we work together with banks , we are , popularly said , a platform on top of banks , meaning your money will never be in our platform , it will be in a bank and that bank will transfer it to another bank in the local country that is being disbursed			2
@entity0 : what are you appealing to in terms of the loan givers ? you are offering them a chance to get involved in charity , or is it just pure business in an economy which will inevitably grow ? tv : i think it is a combination ; these two things go hand in hand			0
a smart two liner would be business must be for profit , but profit must be for a purpose			0
for some it is an obvious " i want to make a profit , " for others it is clearly the social upside of helping other people .			0

@entity9 co-founded @entity10 , a platform helping @entity4 entrepreneurs find money
it works to improve access to credit for small and medium - sized businesses
the web - based marketplace says it has helped more than 6,000 businesses
