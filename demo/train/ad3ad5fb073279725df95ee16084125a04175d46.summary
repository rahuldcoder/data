-- does a week go by without news of federal bureaucrats outrageously extending their tentacles of authority over more of society ? earlier this month it was the @entity7 , announcing its plan to introduce on its own the carbon dioxide limits that @entity10 specifically rejected			1
then it was the @entity11 , insinuating itself into the centuries - old process of aging cheese			0
last week it was the @entity14 trying to shed at last the inconvenience of congressional oversight			0
now the @entity17 is claiming sweeping authority over our smartphones , asserting the right to approve any software that might be used in a car			1
this would likely make the smartphone the first object ever to be regulated both as a medical device and as a piece of motor vehicle equipment			0
yet surprising as it may seem to consumers , the matter is clear to @entity17 regulators , who " maintain that they already have the authority over navigation aids and merely want it clearly written into law , " according to the @entity39			1
@entity17 , the @entity39 reports , believes that apps like @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 pose threats to highway safety that entitle the agency to demand changes to their user interfaces -- matters which are far outside the auto regulator 's zone of expertise			1
under the same principle , of course , @entity17 's control could soon creep beyond the navigation apps			1
any software that might theoretically be used while driving could fall under the agency 's regulatory powers : music applications , news alerts and e-mail notifications , even the phone function itself could be construed as threats to highway safety			2
what 's next ? atlases ? @entity70 maps ? printed directions ? coffee cups from the @entity74 's drive - through ? @entity17 has already pushed car manufacturers to adopt " voluntary " regulatory standards for their in - car navigation systems , but technology companies have not been so willing to hand federal regulators the keys to one of their core products			1
if they 're smart , companies like @entity41 and @entity42 will fight to keep it that way			2
for my book " breakout , " i interviewed @entity90 , a former assistant general counsel for @entity91 who spent much of his career negotiating with @entity17 , including stints at each of the @entity96 auto companies			1
" there 's so much soft power that @entity17 has over the industry , " @entity90 told me , " because you 're always needing extensions and exemptions and ' can i have 60 more days to give you this report ? ' and generally you are expecting to get the ' @entity105 ' permission on that			1
" when manufacturers ignore @entity17 's advice or skirt its " voluntary " guidelines , however , they 're likely to find it a lot more difficult to do business			1
" if they get really irritated at you , " @entity90 said , " they say , ' no , actually you ca n't			0
we want this now , and we 're not going to look at this , and we 're not going to consider that			0
' so you really are encouraged to play ball because you 're counting on them for your existence			0
" @entity90 's experience explains why the automakers ' support for the proposed rules does n't mean much			0
( and besides , free navigation apps on smartphones pose a threat to the expensive systems they sell as upgrades in their cars			2
) subjecting every @entity41 update and fast - food app to this kind of prison - guard behavior would be an enormous blow to a thriving area of innovation			2
the pace of innovation in smartphones is so fast , in fact , that it is solving many of the safety concerns @entity17 raises before the agency even gets around to regulating the technology -- and there is no chance the bureaucrats will ever keep up			1
their " voluntary " guidelines require each interaction with the software to take two seconds or less			0
but on the latest @entity158 phones , users can simply say , without taking their hands off the wheel , " ok @entity41 , navigate to @entity74 's on 108th street in @entity161 , @entity162			0
" this takes longer than two seconds but is far safer than anything @entity17 's rules imagine			2
sen. @entity166 of @entity162 , who has led the way in defeating the @entity11 's attempt to regulate health - related apps , was quick to respond to @entity17 's similar encroachment with an amendment last week to prohibit the agency from " regulating , adopting guidelines with respect to , or prescribing the design of " mobile software			1
such explicit denials of authority may be the only way to deal with a federal bureaucracy that thinks it should have a say about everything			0
contact your members of @entity10 today and tell them to keep bureaucrats ' hands off our smartphones			0
join us on @entity190 / @entity189 .			0

@entity192 says bureaucrats regularly *overreach* , *exceeding* their authority
the latest example is claim by @entity17 that it has authority over some smart phone apps , he says
@entity204 : putting these apps under @entity17 regulation risks *strangling* innovation
