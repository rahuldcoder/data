dr. @entity0 , a gastroenterologist , had to morph into a detective when 10 of his patients came down with the exact same type of rare bacterial infection			0
alarmed and mystified , he and his colleagues rushed to find the source of the highly lethal superbug			2
the culprit , it turned out , was in his own office : a device called a duodenoscope used to check out tiny ducts in the intestinal tract			0
the pseudomonas bacteria had somehow evaded the standard cleaning process , and it infected one patient after another			2
if this sounds familiar , it 's because duodeonoscopes were also the cause of recent infections and deaths at @entity26			1
but @entity0 's patients in @entity28 were infected in 1987 -- and now doctors and members of @entity31 say they 're concerned the @entity32 might have missed the problem for decades			1
@entity35 outbreak : you 're due to go in for a procedure			0
should you ? " this problem has been known since at least 1987 , " said @entity0 , the president of the @entity38			2
" it certainly is disturbing that a fundamental design issue with these scopes would cause problems for this long			0
" on thursday , the @entity32 issued advice to hospitals that in addition to following the manufacturer 's cleaning instructions , they should " meticulously " clean by hand the specific portion of the device believed to harbor the bacteria			1
according to @entity32 spokewoman @entity54 , this is the first time the @entity32 communicated such advice for duodenoscopes			1
on monday , rep. @entity58 , @entity59 , called for congressional hearings			0
" for the life of me , i do n't understand why the @entity32 did n't issue this advice until now , " he said			1
" i want to know what the @entity32 knew and when did they know it			1
" understanding @entity35 , the ' nightmare ' superbug dr. @entity66 , deputy director of science and chief scientist at the @entity32 's @entity69 , said it was n't until 2013 that there was " convincing evidence " that duodenoscopes could harbor antibiotic - resistant infections even when the manufacturer 's cleaning instructions were followed properly , and the agency issued the advisory last week after doing research " so we felt we understood the issue sufficiently			1
" over the years , the @entity32 also received dozens of reports about infections from duodenoscopes			1
" we receive a million adverse event reports [ on various devices ] each year , and we evaluate the reports based on the information that 's provided , " he said			0
but outside the @entity32 , there was significant concern before 2013 that duodenoscopes -- in particular a small mechanism called the elevator wire -- were difficult if not impossible to clean thoroughly			1
in 2010 , safety expert @entity94 published an article in the journal @entity97 calling for special attention to the elevator wire , and in 2011 , a consortium of medical societies warned that automatic cleaning processes did n't always effectively disinfect duodenoscopes and so manual cleaning should be performed			2
but some experts question whether even the most meticulous and diligent manual cleaning will get all the bacteria			2
after an outbreak in 2013 , a hospital in @entity109 tried to get the highly lethal superbug @entity35 out of a duodenoscope and failed , according to @entity0			2
" they really went to extremes , but they still could n't decontaminate the scope , and they finally had to just destroy it , " said @entity0 , now the clinical chief of digestive diseases at @entity115			0
doctors hope that manufacturers will come up with a plan soon			0
" i do think it will take a redesign of the scope to solve the problem , or new sterilization technology , " said dr. @entity125 , a professor of medicine at the @entity127 and lead author of the 2011 guidelines from the medical societies			0
@entity135 , which manufactured the scope used at @entity26 , did not respond to @entity1 's requests for comments specific to this story			1
" this is clearly a matter that needs addressing , " said dr. @entity140 , an infectious disease expert at the @entity142 who published an article in 2013 on a duodenoscope outbreak in @entity146			0
" we really should have done this sooner			0

duodeonoscopes were the cause of recent superbug infections and deaths at @entity26
the @entity32 issued cleaning guidance last thursday
doctors say they *'ve* known about the trouble of cleaning them at least since 1987
