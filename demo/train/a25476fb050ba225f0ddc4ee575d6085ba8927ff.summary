-- the @entity1 recently voted on a bill titled " @entity3 in the @entity4			1
" a laudable goal , for sure -- but activists characterized the bill as a trojan horse with chilling effects on free speech and opinion			1
the response from the @entity1 left much to be desired in terms of respect for democracy and voters			1
the bill looked great on the surface -- almost idealistic -- but a closer inspection revealed things that went beyond the appropriate			2
for instance , the bill called for a blanket ban on any and all forms of pornography -- arguably including anything on the @entity27 -- as well as concrete measures to enforce the ban			1
regardless of whether one thinks pornography has a place in society or should be a protected form of expression , the bill encompassed far more than most would term " porn			2
" the language was so vague , and so broad , that it could even criminalize text messages with an ever - so - slightly sexual overtone between husbands and wives			0
furthermore , it called for @entity43 ( @entity43 ) to police ordinary people 's communications and for dissent against the ban to be criminalized , with " effective sanctions " the penalty for opposition			1
the term " effective sanctions " usually means fines or jail			0
upon realizing the legislative impact of what had initially been a laudable goal , activists ' cries of a trojan horse did n't seem so far off the mark			0
had a bill that criminalized dissent really been voted through all committees and made it as far as the floor of the @entity1 ? several people in parliament discarded the bill and the discussions of it as " not important " because it was n't the final vote in the legislative process , and at this stage was non-binding			1
free - speech activists started contacting their representatives en masse though			1
the message was n't so much " do n't take away our porn ! " as " you can not possibly think this bill , as it is written , is compatible with any kind of fundamental rights			0
" about 250,000 email messages were sent to the @entity1 on the morning of march 7			2
then , something odd happened			0
around lunchtime on march 7 , the email messages stopped coming into parliament , despite still being sent by individual activists -- hand - typed , individual messages of concern			0
it turned out that some members of @entity1 ( @entity94 ) -- to this day , it remains unclear just who -- had complained to technical staff about the amount of constituents seeking contact with their representative on a current issue , and succeeded in having technical staff classify the messages as spam , so they never got through			2
the notion that one or a few @entity94 could use parliamentary technical staff and infrastructure to prevent constituents from contacting any part of parliament on a current issue is jaw - dropping			0
not just shutting themselves off , but shutting their colleagues off as well -- shutting off the entire parliament off from its constituents ' opinions			0
@entity121 media estimated that one million e-mails were prevented from reaching their representatives			0
the bill was finally voted through on march 12 , but not before the parts that criminalized dissent and turned @entity43 into communications police had been taken out			2
there were still calls for enforcing a blanket ban on pornography , but nothing likely to have a real political effect			1
it is also impossible for people to hold their politicians accountable on this issue , as the @entity1 did not use a " roll call vote , " meaning there is no record of how individuals voted			1
the idea that a vote can be deliberately constructed in a way that prevents office - holder accountability is astounding			0
if activists had n't made a lot of noise on the matter , the parts of the bill that criminalized dissent and turned @entity43 into morals police would quite possibly have passed too			2
i ca n't help feeling a very bitter aftertaste from the @entity1 's demonstration of how little it cares about the people it represents -- deleting one million attempts by constituents to contact members of @entity1 , and then declining to create any kind of voting record			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0
