-- this week , as i was searching for popular topics and interesting articles , i kept finding posts dealing with obesity			0
it does n't really make sense , but for whatever reason , the @entity9 world seems to be fascinated by fat			1
there was chatter about a new report that says by 2030 half of all adults in @entity17 will be considered obese			0
essentially , in 18 years most of us will be sweating actual bacon grease			0
reading this report was sort of depressing , but at the same time , it was also kind of encouraging			0
depressing , because we 're all becoming a bunch of disgusting fat - bodies			1
encouraging , because it sounds like , perhaps , the future holds pie ! another trending article told how lawyers for an obese death row inmate in @entity32 say their client ca n't be executed because he weighs almost 500 pounds -- it 'll cause too much pain and suffering to administer the lethal injection			1
on top of that , they argue that the gurney literally might not even be able to hold him			0
i simply ca n't imagine how one actually gains that much weight sitting behind bars , presumably separated by several states and ( at the very least ) a sheet of plexiglass from @entity46			1
i seriously do n't know			2
maybe he has conjugal visits with a tub of buttermilk			0
" but the story that really got to me -- the one that really tugged at the empty space where my heartstrings would be if i had the ability to feel -- was about a dog			2
but not just any dachshund			2
a 77 - pound dachshund ! i do n't know how to put this any other way , but ... that 's a huge wiener ! ( thanks , folks			1
i 'll be here all week			0
) the 5 - year - old dog 's name is @entity67 , and he was originally owned by an elderly couple in @entity69			1
apparently , they expressed their love for him through food			2
and @entity67 expressed his love for them by becoming a zeppelin			1
a relative of the elderly couple eventually put out a plea for help , and a willing foster mom emerged in @entity82 , @entity83			1
when @entity67 finally arrived on august 18 , driven down by a friendly volunteer , @entity84 was shocked by the size of her new dog			1
the former vet tech had seen a lot in her day , but this thing here was blocking out the damn sun. thus began @entity93 , @entity94 -- an epic quest to get @entity67 back into shape			1
@entity84 started a @entity98 page for @entity67 -- who 's otherwise healthy -- to track his weight loss and solicit donations for help			1
she also wanted her dog 's story to rally humans			1
@entity84 wrote , " my hope is that he can be an inspiration to any person or animal trying to lose weight			2
it is so important to introduce pups and kids to a healthy lifestyle and food choices as early as possible			2
@entity116 is the key ! " and she 's right			2
good habits make healthy dogs			2
hopefully , excessive weight gain wo n't really be something i 'm going to have to worry about with my dog , @entity125			1
he 's a @entity127 mix who , one would think , could eat the entire contents of my fridge given a full hour and nothing better to do			0
but , amazingly , he 's not overly motivated by food so much as he 's completely motivated by licking the place where his testicles used to be			2
i stopped judging him a long time ago			0
i 've got my hobbies			0
still , i do n't get why he 's not completely hyper - crazy - bonkers - insane about food like other dogs			1
i do n't allow him any people food , so it 's not like he knows he 's missing out on something better			1
i swoon for that stupid thing			0
" eventually , @entity125 eats			0
but when he 's full , he stops			0
this dog literally has the self - control to leave remaining food just sitting in the bowl			1
whereas i ca n't remember the last time i did n't lick my plate			0
i 'm single , ladies			0
your parents will love me			0
but despite my dog 's disinterest in food , what 's even more amazing is that @entity67 -- that short , stumpy dachshund -- actually weighs more than @entity125			1
and he 's still completely adorable ! besides , chubbing out was n't @entity67 's fault			1
naturally , it was human error			0
getting all nice and fat has clearly become the great @entity17 pastime			0
and these days there 's an added incentive , because , now if you manage to get your entire family to weigh more than a @entity171 they give you a show on @entity173 ! though , not to be outdone , @entity67 has already been on the @entity174			1
and in his own private version of @entity176 , he 's sure to be the big wiener			0
i 'll be here all week			0

@entity181 : for whatever reason , the @entity9 world seems to be fascinated by fat
a dachshund named @entity67 in @entity82 , @entity83 , weighs 77 pounds
@entity67 's new owner started a @entity98 page to track his weight loss
@entity181 : i do n't get why my dog 's not hyper - bonkers - insane about food like other dogs
