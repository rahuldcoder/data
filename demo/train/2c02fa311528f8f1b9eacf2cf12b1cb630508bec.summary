-- @entity1 from an @entity3 volcano has led to the cancellation of a number of flights in the region since friday , with travelers heading to and from the country now advised to check with airlines to confirm the status of their flights before traveling			1
@entity14 is a small , uninhabited volcanic island in @entity3 's @entity15			1
it 's considered one of the most active in the area by scientists			0
friday 's volcanic activity shot thick plumes of ash and sulfur dioxide more than 20 kilometers into the sky , which then drifted as far as northern @entity25			1
some airlines decided to ground flights in and out of @entity29 's @entity28 on monday morning , due to worries that the ash cloud was approaching			2
however , the most recent reports say the ash is dispersing			0
on saturday , all flights to and from @entity25 's @entity35 were canceled because of the hazardous ash cloud but have since resumed			1
" @entity39 continues to monitor @entity40 in close consultation with the @entity42 , " said the airline in a statement on monday			0
" there may be some changes to scheduling of @entity47 services today			0
" @entity39 will endeavor to contact all guests with affected affected bookings			0
we also recommend customers continue to check the flight status page on our website			0
" @entity47 services to and from @entity35 resumed on june 1 , said @entity39			2
on monday morning , low - cost carrier @entity55 canceled two flights out of @entity58 and @entity59 that were due to stop in @entity47 , following nine other international and domestic cancellations over the weekend			0
@entity61 was also forced to ground fights over the weekend due to the ash , but has since resumed operations as normal			1
according to the @entity67 's @entity66 , intermittent historical eruptions have been recorded at @entity14 since 1512 , most of them during in the 20th century			2
the last confirmed eruption of @entity14 was in 1997			2
why airlines ca n't fly through ash the @entity72 set up the @entity73 in response to a number of serious aviation encounters with volcanic ash in the 1980s			1
composed of experts from nine global @entity80 , the organization alerts the aviation industry of the location and movement of clouds of volcanic ash			1
for instance , @entity3 's volcanic eruptions are monitored by the @entity88			1
" volcanic ash in the air is composed of fine pulverized rock and accompanied by a number of gases , which are then converted into droplets of sulfuric acid and other substances , " says the center			1
" it is potentially deadly to aircraft and their passengers			0
the most critical effect is caused by ash melting in the hot section of the engine , and then fusing into a glass - like coating on components further back in the engine , causing loss of thrust and possible ' flame out ' ( engine failure )			0
" in addition there is an abrasion of engine parts , the airframe and parts protruding from the aircraft , and possible clogging of the fuel and cooling systems			0
" the @entity35 center cites an incident in june 1982 , when a @entity124 747 suffered severe damage and had all four engines flame out upon encountering ash from @entity128 in @entity3 , descending to 12,000 feet before being able to restart some engines and make an emergency landing in @entity131			1
" three weeks later the same thing happened to a @entity134 747 , which this time lost two engines and also made an emergency landing , " the center said			0
" quite apart from the safety consideration , volcanic ash has caused very expensive damage to aircraft ; most estimates cite costs to aviation of over $ 250 million since 1982			1
" the world 's @entity80 use satellite information , ground reports from volcanology agencies , pilot reports , meteorological knowledge and numerical models to track and forecast ash movements			0

@entity3 's @entity14 volcano erupted friday , sending clouds of ash and smoke into the sky
volcanic ash drifted as far as @entity25 , forcing @entity35 to cancel fights over weekend
the ash is dangerous for a number of reasons , says the @entity88
