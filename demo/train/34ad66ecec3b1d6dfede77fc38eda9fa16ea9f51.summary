-- @entity1 , a @entity3 - @entity2 doctor living in @entity4 , says he can not sleep these days			1
" the humanitarian situation in many parts of @entity3 has reached its lowest point			1
it is so horrific , " said @entity1 , who collects and delivers aid to @entity3			1
as violence escalates in the sanctions - hit country and - - many argue -- the lack of government cooperation , humanitarian groups have been unable to reach those suffering the most in the country			1
even the @entity18 & @entity19 , the only independent international aid agency operating inside @entity3 , has not reached trapped citizens in devastated areas such as the @entity24 neighborhood in the city of @entity24			1
last weekend , the aid group released a statement saying it started distributing aid to people in the restive city			2
but @entity31 , its @entity32 - based spokesman , said thursday the aid is located at nine distribution centers around the city , but none has reached ravaged neighborhoods such as @entity24			1
residents and activists in the neighborhood said friday they have not had any humanitarian aid reach them in more than a month			1
" it is the 13th days of shelling over our neighborhood , " said @entity42 , who was reached by satellite internet at a @entity24 shelter			2
" we have not had any electricity , phone service , ... or even running water for weeks			0
we have not had any food or medical supplies either			0
we are so desperate ! there are only a few houses here that have water wells			0
that 's our only access to any water ! " @entity42 , who did not want to reveal his real name over safety fears , said the few dozen people staying at shelters in @entity24 shower once every five days or so and limit other use of water to only drinking			0
@entity67 , another resident of @entity24 , said he has not seen any bread coming from outside the neighborhood in weeks			0
" that 's why we decided to collect whatever flour we could find to bake some bread and share at the shelters , " @entity67 said			0
" we have no baby formula			0
parents put bread in water ... and that 's what babies eat and drink			0
" there is only one medical facility in @entity24 operating out of a basement of a mosque			2
it moved there because its last location was shelled in january , killing three medics , according to @entity89 , one of a handful of doctors running the makeshift clinic using " primitive tools			0
" back in the @entity2 , @entity1 says the suffering will only get worse in many parts of @entity3 unless there is a way to deliver humanitarian aid to those who need it most			1
shortly after the @entity3 uprising began on march 15 , @entity1 and other @entity3 - @entity2 professionals started the @entity3 @entity103 to collect donations and deliver them to affected families in the nation			1
" in light of the sanctions , we did not want to fall into any legal traps			0
and we did not want to deal with the government 's institutions			0
so we started paying influential businessmen inside @entity3 in @entity2 dollars and get food , water , blankets among other humanitarian items in return , " @entity1 said			1
this worked for only a few months until no more businessman could risk doing that under the watchful eye of the regime , he said			0
so he identified financial institutions in @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 -- to which the group transferred money in order to buy aid locally			2
the aid was then smuggled across the @entity3 borders			1
but with more and more limited safe passages into @entity3 and a drying flow of cash , this option became even harder			2
the current sanctions allow transferring money to charitable groups in @entity3			2
" but how could we trust these government - sponsored @entity3 groups to oversee the distribution of aid ? ' @entity1 said			1
a couple of international humanitarian groups such as the @entity148 for @entity3 admit that they only go through @entity3 charity organizations to reach affected people inside the country			1
others -- such as @entity154 and @entity155 -- only reach out to @entity3 refugees in neighboring countries			1
" the only way to reach us in @entity24 is through establishing safe passages , " @entity42 said			2
on the international level , @entity161 is trying to revive a plan it first introduced in november that tries to do just that			2
the idea is to provide safe access for relief organizations to deliver aid to affected populations through land border routes , a sea port or an airport - - all under the watch of international observers			1
but such a plan needs either @entity3 government approval or the backing of armed peacekeepers			2
in the latter case , a @entity181 resolution may be needed			0
@entity161 foreign minister @entity183 © discussed his government 's " humanitarian corridors " plan thursday with his @entity188 counterpart , @entity187 , in order to avoid a veto on a possible @entity192 resolution			0
the two met in @entity194 to reach a compromise despite @entity196 vetoing a @entity181 resolution based on an @entity199 proposal on feb. 4 , according to @entity188 's state - run @entity200			0
" we can possibly reach a compromise on a short - term objective			0
" @entity203 told reporters " we are ready to work in @entity205 on a draft resolution inspired by the @entity199 to stop the violence and provide humanitarian aid			1
" @entity187 was not committed to the plan and said more details are needed before an agreement , @entity200 reported			0
but many @entity3 seem to have no choice but to be optimistic as their tragedy plays out on the international stage			1
" i am hopeful , " @entity215 said			0
" i am finally sensing change among international and regional powers regarding the suffering in @entity3 ... and it is about time ! "			1

" the humanitarian situation in many parts of @entity3 has reached its lowest point , " doctor says
an international aid agency operating inside @entity3 can not reach trapped citizens
the suffering will only get worse in @entity3 unless there is a way to deliver humanitarian aid
