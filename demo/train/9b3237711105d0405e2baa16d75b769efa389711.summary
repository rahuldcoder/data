it is a charade , " he said			0

@entity2 's response : " i do n't like the idea of getting 2 to 3 million people [ @entity2 supporters ] angry at me			1
" @entity15 's aides argued that the @entity3 @entity2 should endorse @entity15 because he would do a " little less harm " than @entity16 , @entity2 said , but " we just do n't need to do that anymore			1
" " if you ever get to the point where you believe the two parties are essentially the same , if the majority is outside of the establishment , it 's not very democratic			2
the process is not working , " @entity2 said			2
@entity2 attacked @entity16 , saying , " he 's not for change , " and the congressman argued that his efforts would help the @entity2			1
" if the @entity2 side realized what i 'm trying to do , they should be funding me , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 failed in his bid for the @entity2 nomination , but he found a large , diverse audience for his anti-war and anti-tax messages			0

i hope you lost your apathy			0
" " i did not want to run people 's lives			0
