-- the ambulance sped toward @entity2 , @entity3 , from the @entity5 airport , overrun with refugees from a drowned city			1
a mother pregnant with twins screamed from labor pains			1
@entity11 , a nurse and midwife who struggles with car sickness , tried to stay focused			1
the babies were n't going to wait			1
five minutes into the ride , @entity15 delivered the first twin with no problem			2
but then , she saw two feet beginning to emerge -- a breech baby			2
" do n't push ! do n't push ! do n't push ! " today , five years after delivering those twins in the midst of the chaos that @entity24 wreaked , @entity15 dwells -- not on the death and destruction that was so well - documented -- but on the life that emerged			1
she and her team delivered 20 healthy babies amid the storm 's aftermath in a two - week period that " changed my life			1
" " it 's one of those events in @entity39 that we should never forget			2
" @entity15 , now 58 , has traveled the world with organizations like @entity42 and @entity43			2
she went to @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 in the 1990s to teach midwives in those @entity50 countries how best to deal with emergencies			2
a year before @entity24 , she traveled to @entity52 with the @entity53 to figure out why so many mothers and babies were dying at a hospital in @entity57			1
as @entity24 spun toward the @entity59 , the urge to help came natural			1
based out of @entity60 , @entity15 was a member of @entity63 's @entity62 , a group of about 30 physicians , general practitioners , nurses , nurse practitioners and other specialists			1
they were told to head to @entity69 , along with teams from @entity71 and @entity72			2
@entity24 had swept ashore , and the levee had been breached			1
" i had never in my life seen such a disaster as i had in @entity5 , " @entity15 says			1
" and , believe me , i 've seen the worst of everything			2
" at the airport , thousands of people milled about			1
elderly patients from nursing homes had been dropped off , without medications or even adult diapers			2
@entity85 was out , and there was no running water			2
" there were two policemen and two security guards , " @entity15 says			2
" there was no organization			2
we did n't know who to answer to			0
... nobody was in charge			0
" prepas and the other 89 medical professionals swung into action			0
they set up three tents at the front of the airport -- green , for walking wounded and pregnant women ; yellow , for slightly more serious conditions ; red , for critical patients			1
" by the end of two weeks , we had screened and triaged more than 20,000 people			0
" @entity15 was stationed in the green tent , and , at one point , was caring for 50 prenatal patients			0
she was sleeping on a luggage carousel when the first woman in labor arrived			0
@entity15 set up a privacy sheet in the tent and prepared a cot			0
the first baby to be born at the airport was healthy			1
" his name was @entity125 , " she says			0
on the third day , @entity39 military personnel arrived to establish order amid the pandemonium			1
on that same day , the woman pregnant with twins was brought to the airport			1
@entity15 still does n't know how the woman got there			0
" she was 8 centimeters dilated , and she was ready to deliver			1
" the woman 's husband and two sons were at the convention center with no idea she was in labor , or where she had gone			0
all @entity15 knew was : " i had to get her out			0
" frantically searching for an ambulance , @entity15 found a group of paramedics who had driven more than 500 miles from @entity143 , @entity144			0
" guys , you 've got to drive me to @entity2 , " @entity15 barked			0
" now ! " the paramedics radioed a hospital in @entity2 to let them know they were bringing a woman in labor with twins			0
the two baby boys had other plans			0
both boys were delivered en route			0
the second child , who came out feet first , was discolored			0
he received oxygen for the next 30 minutes , until they arrived			0
two more weeks passed before that mother and her babies were reunited with the rest of their family			1
@entity15 ' time in @entity5 affected her profoundly on so many different levels			1
@entity15 has curtailed most of her overseas humanitarian missions ; she now flies mostly to places in need within the @entity39 -- the quake in @entity171 being an exception			0
a member of the @entity174 , @entity15 has used the experience to bring attention to rising maternal mortality rates inside the @entity39 , one of the worst in the industrialized world			0
in 1982 , eight women died per 100,000 live births in the @entity39 ; now , the figure has jumped to 17 per 100,000 , largely due to lack of health care for the nation 's poorest women , according to the @entity174			0
" women are going to have babies out of place , " especially during disaster , she says			1
" we have to be prepared for that			0
" one of the toughest things about her job in @entity5 was delivering the babies -- and then walking away			1
" life goes on after an emergency , " she says			1
" i never stayed in touch with them ... but i think about it all the time			0
it drives me to keep wanting to do all this stuff			0
it 's given me a mission in life			1

@entity11 focuses not on the destruction of @entity24 , but the life that emerged
the nurse / midwife helped deliver 20 babies at the @entity5 airport amid the chaos
