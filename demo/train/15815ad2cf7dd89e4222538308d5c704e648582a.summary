-- anyone can shake hands			1
@entity3 made such a common gesture something transcendent -- a greeting that crossed all societal barriers , a symbol of reconciliation , even a declaration of victory			1
" hello ! how are you ? i 'm so happy to see you , " he would declare in his distinctive tenor , extending a huge right hand befitting the former boxer			2
before meeting visiting dignitaries or political adversaries in five - star hotel conference rooms , @entity3 made sure to approach the security guards , servers and other workers outside to shake their hands			1
at countless rallies of his @entity26 , crowds mobbed his path in hopes of a quick clasp from the graying leader			2
" i want to put you in my pocket and take you home , " he would tell them			1
such was his common touch , a personal warmth and accessibility that delighted adoring supporters and cemented global admiration for the longtime political prisoner who became @entity40 's first black president			2
' our nation has lost its greatest son ' to me , a journalist who covered the " @entity3 years " from a few months after his release from prison in 1990 through most of his presidency , he was the closest thing to a messiah i have witnessed , if you define messiah as one who brings hope to the hopeless			1
tall and trim , his face often beaming an incandescent smile , @entity3 had his own style expressed in colorful @entity40 shirts he wore in lieu of business suits , a teasing rapport with youngsters , and his shoulder - swinging , celebratory dance dubbed the " @entity3 shuffle " in reference to his clan name			1
leading a transformation wherever he went , people seemed to materialize out of the air -- scampering down alleys and around cars , scrambling over and through fences , even climbing any nearby tree or billboard for a better view			2
the mood was festive , not frenzied , with crowds singing praise songs in deep - voiced harmonies that elongated the second syllable of his name in an @entity40 pronunciation -- @entity86			2
a lawyer of tribal royalty heritage , he possessed an unerring sense of his role as the nation 's de facto leader at a time when the @entity26 struggled to evolve from a liberation movement to a full - fledged political party			2
images of him during those years create an indelible timeline of the nation 's transformation from the white rule of apartheid to a multiracial democracy			2
@entity3 : the miracle years there was the fist - waving , smiling @entity3 who walked out of prison in 1990 , his every move and word broadcast around the world as well as on national television that once banned black faces			1
from that moment , the machinations of @entity40 politics changed , and the new order became obvious when the nation 's first multiparty political talks began in december 1991			0
watershed moments opening speeches by @entity3 and other leaders were generally non-combative policy statements until @entity40 president @entity124 , exercising his privilege to go last , attacked the @entity26 for refusing to disband its armed wing and turn over weapons			1
visibly furious at @entity124 's maneuver , @entity3 requested an opportunity to respond and the sympathetic moderators agreed			1
that alone was a shift from the old days			0
with the meeting hall spellbound , @entity3 delivered a face - to - face upbraiding of the white president , telling @entity124 that " even a discredited , illegitimate , minority regime must observe certain moral standards			1
" no one had ever witnessed such a thing in @entity40			0
less visible were his efforts to control radical elements of his @entity26			0
at the party 's first legal conference in @entity40 in december 1990 , he lectured activists calling for a halt in secret talks between @entity26 leaders and the white government aimed at setting up formal negotiations			0
'' these statements can only be made by those who do not understand the process of negotiation , " @entity3 said in a stern voice			1
" ... let me take advantage of this opportunity to educate you on the problems that face the leadership			0
'' after the 1993 assassination of @entity163 , a popular communist firebrand considered a possible future @entity26 leader , @entity3 appeared on state - run national television to urge calm among his black supporters			1
it was an unprecedented acknowledgement by the white government that the @entity26 leader was the only one who could head off potentially calamitous unrest			0
" this is a watershed moment for all of us , " he said directly to the camera			0
" our decisions and actions will determine whether we use our pain , our grief and our outrage to move forward to what is the only lasting solution for our country - an elected government of the people , by the people and for the people			0
" @entity186 : @entity3 's legacy will live on @entity3 also had a humorous side , even flirtatious at times			1
at election rallies in 1994 , he repeatedly elicited trilling howls of ululation from women of all ages when he explained how voters should search their ballots for the picture of the " very handsome young man " -- referring to himself -- to mark their support for the @entity26			2
for the lone debate of the campaign between @entity202 , i watched on a communal television at the @entity204 in @entity205 to write about the reaction of teenagers in the vast black township			0
one handshake held a nation spellbound as expected , they cheered each time @entity3 spoke , but my lasting memory was how these young black @entity40 seemed transfixed by the mere image of their leader sharing the screen with equal status to the white president			1
they went wild when @entity3 concluded his final statement by offering his hand to @entity124 as an expression of unity , saying that despite their differences , he was willing to work with his adversary			1
@entity227 had little choice but to grasp it			0
@entity3 's handshake could have another meaning			1
at his divorce trial in 1996 , he testified in withering detail how his spouse , the popular activist @entity233 , never once shared his bed while he was awake after his release from prison			0
" the bedroom is where a man and woman discuss the most intimate details , " @entity3 told the court			1
" there were so many things i wanted to discuss with her , but she is the type of person who fears confrontation			0
i was the loneliest man during the period i stayed with her			0
" when he finished , @entity3 approached his soon to be ex-wife and shook her hand , having destroyed any chance she had of gaining a favorable settlement			1
i experienced many @entity3 handshakes , mostly before news conferences or interviews in the usual exchange of pleasantries between political figures and journalists			1
some are captured in photos that will always be prized possessions			0
one that was not photographed occurred after a public dressing down from the president at a @entity272 dinner in 1996			0
during the question period after @entity3 spoke , i asked about his recent criticism of the @entity40 media as biased against the @entity26			1
was he trying to intimidate newspapers , i wondered , or seeking to shift attention from his government 's struggle to deliver promised development to poor blacks			0
in an angry voice , he berated the foreign media for failing to report on what he called unfair treatment the @entity26 received from @entity40 newspapers			0
" why are you defending them ? " he asked of the room stunned to silence			0
as he left the event shortly afterward , he made his way past my table where he stopped and reached out his hand , looking me in the eye			2
with no words spoken , we exchanged a single , slightly pronounced shake			2
another victory for his @entity26 secured , he headed to the exit .			0

before meeting visiting dignitaries @entity3 made sure to shake hands with workers
at rallies he would tell supporters , " i want to put you in my pocket and take you home "
@entity3 also had a humorous side , even flirtatious at times
