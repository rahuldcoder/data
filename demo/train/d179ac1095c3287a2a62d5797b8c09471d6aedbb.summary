-- @entity1 on wednesday named @entity3 chairman @entity2 as its 2009 @entity4 , calling him " the most powerful nerd on the planet			1
" @entity2 will be featured on the cover of the magazine that hits stores friday			1
he beat out @entity11 sprinter @entity10 , president @entity12 , @entity14 ceo @entity13 and house speaker @entity15 among other finalists			0
@entity1 said @entity2 was the reason the @entity19 financial crisis was n't worse			1
" @entity20 was a weak economy that could have been much , much weaker			0
thank the man who runs the @entity3 , our mild - mannered economic overlord , " the article said			1
" he did n't just reshape @entity19 monetary policy ; he led an effort to save the world economy			0
" time : @entity4 2009 @entity2 is considered a scholar of the @entity29			1
a series of his writings were compiled into the book " @entity33			0
" @entity34 , who authored @entity1 's article , on wednesday told @entity36 's " today " that " basically [ @entity2 ] saw what looked like another depression coming , and he decided he would do whatever it takes to forestall that			1
and basically , i think he did			0
it could have been a lot worse			0
" @entity34 said , " there are things that he could have done better			0
one of his responsibilities is for full employment in society , and he has n't really stepped up on that , but basically in terms of influencing how the economy went this year , @entity2 was the guy			2
" the @entity1 senior correspondent added , " look , he 's been criticized from left and right , from liberals and conservatives , you know , for ... running the unelected fourth branch of government			2
he 's a controversial figure			0
" wednesday 's announcement comes a day before a @entity61 vote on whether @entity2 should be given another term			1
" remember , he 's a @entity63 appointed by a @entity65 president			2
it 's the democrats on the committee that are going to vote to confirm			2
it 's a really interesting combination of factors , " @entity34 said			0
one of @entity2 's harshest critics is sen. @entity71 , @entity72 , the only senator to vote against the economist 's appointment four years ago by president @entity75			1
in a statement wednesday , @entity71 said , " i find it ironic that a man who has spent the last year rewarding others for failure is now being named ' @entity4			0
' " but if @entity1 is in the business of rewarding failure , @entity2 is their man -- he has certainly excelled at that			1
" @entity71 called @entity2 a " moral hazard , " accusing him of supporting the " easy money policies of his predecessor , @entity86 , " who made the cover of @entity1 in february 1999 , along with then - treasury secretary @entity90 and his successor , @entity91			1
another sharp critic of @entity2 , independent sen. @entity93 of @entity94 , said december 2 that he plans to place a " hold " on @entity2 's nomination for a second term once it leaves the @entity61			1
a " hold " is an informal practice in which a senator informs the majority leader that he or she does not want a bill or nomination to reach the floor for a vote			2
majority leader sen. @entity107 , @entity108 , would not need to act on @entity93 ' request , but @entity93 could launch a filibuster to delay the motion to nominate the @entity3 chairman for another four - year term			1
" the @entity19 people overwhelmingly voted last year for a change in our national priorities to put the interests of ordinary people ahead of the greed of @entity122 and the wealthy few , " @entity93 said then , explaining his action			0
" what the @entity19 people did not bargain for was another four years for one of the key architects of the @entity75 economy			0
" @entity1 noted that @entity2 , who turned 56 sunday , defies the stereotype of " a typical @entity129 power broker			1
" " he does n't have a commanding presence			0
he is n't a mesmerizing speaker			0
he has none of the look - at - me swagger or listen - to - me charisma so common among men with oversize @entity138 offices , " the article said			0
@entity2 was sworn in as @entity3 chairman in february 2006			1
he spent years in academia , as a professor at @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity145 universities and the @entity146 , according to the @entity3 's web site			2
@entity1 , like @entity0 , is a unit of @entity149 .			2

@entity63 senator and critic calls @entity2 " moral hazard "
@entity1 calls @entity2 , 56 , " the most powerful nerd on the planet "
