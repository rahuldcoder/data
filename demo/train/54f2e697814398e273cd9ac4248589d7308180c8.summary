@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 hanged an @entity4 leader thursday despite pleas not to from the @entity6			1
the execution came after the country 's @entity8 upheld the death sentence against @entity11 , state - run news agency @entity12 reported			1
@entity11 was sentenced in september after being convicted of crimes against humanity that date back to 1971 , during the country 's war for independence			1
the execution , originally scheduled for tuesday , was delayed by the @entity8 at the last minute			2
@entity11 was the assistant secretary general for the @entity20 party , which earlier this year was banned from taking part in elections			1
court decisions in his case , and others against senior @entity20 leaders have resulted in violent protests in the streets			2
in february , he was convicted of war crimes by an international panel set up by the government in an attempt to bring to justice those accused of atrocities			2
he was originally sentenced to life in prison , but many @entity1 held protests saying the sentence was n't harsh enough			0
the @entity8 then sentenced him to death			0
in the country 's legal system , that decision can not be appealed			0
concerns over trial two @entity6 human rights experts called on @entity1 on monday to halt the execution because of concerns that @entity11 did not receive a fair trial			1
" the right of appeal is of particular importance in death penalty cases , " said @entity49 , @entity6 special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers			1
" anyone convicted of a crime has the right to have his or her conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal , as laid down in the @entity66 to which @entity1 is a party , " she said in a statement			0
" this provision is violated where a court of final instance imposes a harsher sentence that can not be reviewed , " the statement said			2
@entity75 , @entity6 special rapporteur on summary executions , said capital punishment " may be imposed only following a trial that complied with fair trial and due process safeguards			1
... only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as possibly permitted under international law from a summary execution , which by definition violates human rights standards			1
" on tuesday , @entity90 @entity89 called for a stay , saying the trial had not met stringent international standards for the death penalty , the @entity6 said in a statement			1
the @entity6 opposes the death penalty in any circumstance			1
political tensions @entity20 , a major ally of the main opposition party @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , is a constant thorn in the side of the ruling @entity103			0
@entity104 enjoys considerable support , particularly in rural areas			0
and periodically , it mobilizes its adherents in large - scale demonstrations in @entity0 to show its strength			0
but it has faced pressure from the @entity103 and progressive groups that point to @entity114 's role during @entity1 's struggle for independence from @entity117			0
between 1 million and 3 million people were killed in the nine - month war			0
the @entity122 , the court set up by the government in 2010 , has convicted several other top @entity20 leaders of crimes against humanity			2
@entity20 acknowledges that it opposed @entity1 's struggle for independence , but it has decried what it calls a smear campaign against it			0
it has also questioned why the @entity103 is only now pressing forward on war crimes trials when it did n't do so while in power during the 1970s and 1990s .			0
