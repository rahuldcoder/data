-- in theory , @entity1 is simple : take a sheet of paper , follow the dotted lines and without the use of scissors or glue , you 've got a paper crane			1
it stands to reason that if you 're good at following instructions , you 're good at origami			1
and that 's trueâ € ” anyone can fold their way to a simple paper crane			2
but truly grasping the geometric complexities of that crane ? that 's actually pretty brainy stuff			0
@entity23 origami is arguably more math than art , so it makes sense then that @entity28 would have a thriving origami scene			1
every sunday , a group of around 20 to 30 people gather on campus to experiment with paper folding techniques			1
most recently , the group folded a series of turkeys , cornucopias , pine cones and vegetables to create a gorgeously nerdy @entity23 tableau			1

@entity50 , a sophomore mathematics major at @entity28 , is the incoming president of of @entity52 , and has been practicing paper folding since high school			1
" i really love how systematic origami is , " he says			2
" it 's the perfect combination of math and art. " the math behind the art every origami model you see relies on a blueprintâ € ” a series of pre-determined creases that will guide the folder through the process			2
in the beginning , precise , careful folding can get you pretty far , but if you want to start riffing on designs or creating your own , you have to have more than an elementary grasp on some basic mathematical principles			2
" i got more involved in investigating the connections between math and geometry behind it , " he says			0
" these days a lot of the stuff i fold is a lot more geometric , more tessellations			0
" for the @entity23 scene , @entity50 contributed the cornucopia basket , which he nonchalantly describes as a " pretty well - known conical , flat tessellation pattern			1

it 's not uncommon for the group to have a lengthy discussion about reverse - engineering each of the diagram 's folds or talk about polyhedral shapes and hexagonal symmetry			1
" we 'll ask ourselves , ' ok , where does this step come from , why does a designer choose to do it like this ? or i wonder if i started with these proportions , what would happen ? " @entity50 explains			0
" that really comes out of the engineering background of a lot of our members			0
" no need for whizz skills @entity50 is quick to clarify that though @entity52 probably tends to be slightly more math - centric than your typical origami club , you do n't need to possess a beautiful mind - caliber math skills to join in			1
sure , the peacock - like turkey took more than three hours to fold , but if you look around , there are tons of simple yet beautiful contributions like the vegetables , leaves and pine cones			0
" we wanted to show that there are models of varying complexities			0
sometimes people get intimidated because they think we 're folding all of these complex models , " he says			0
" but actually everyone can get involvedâ € ” it 's not something that 's exclusive and insular in any way			0

a group of @entity28 students started an origami club to push the *boundaries* of paper folding
the club explores the geometrical nature of origami to create *complicated* shapes
they recently created an elaborate @entity23 *inspired* tableau
