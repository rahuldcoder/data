the suspects included a mother and son , a separate mother and daughter , and two men			2
all are still jailed , according to the prosecutor who handled the case			2
the incident , which drew extensive media coverage , stirred outrage around the country			2
civil rights activist the rev. @entity48 called for the incident to be investigated as a hate crime			2
last year , all six defendants pleaded guilty and were given terms of up to 40 years in prison			1
@entity10 said his client was coming forward " to right the wrong perpetrated on these six individuals			0
