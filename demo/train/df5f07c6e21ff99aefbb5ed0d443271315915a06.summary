-- " who are we ? " it 's a question @entity3 have been asking themselves for some time			1
tucked away at the meeting point of @entity9 @entity8 and the @entity10 , the people here have identified with both @entity11 and @entity12			0
it 's a question @entity15 's president @entity14 believes he 's given the definitive answer to			2
at one of his many public rallies he told supporters : " we are an @entity9 , @entity21 nation			0
anyone who does n't like it can go			0
" this was after those who did n't like it did exactly that : in 2011 , after a peace agreement brought to an end more than 21 years of civil war , the majority of @entity29 chose to secede and create their own country , aptly named @entity15			1
but it has n't brought the two countries any closer to a lasting peace : border squabbles and skirmishes over the division of oil wealth are still the norm			1
it did , though , give islamists in northern @entity15 a clearer goal for the " cultural project " launched in 1989 when they took power in a military coup that instated @entity49 law and did away with any semblance of political plurality			1
@entity53 theocracy the project denounced the multi-ethnic , culturally - rich @entity15 -- with its @entity57 chants and @entity59 festivals -- and reinforced -- as an @entity53 theocracy with headscarves and " public order " courts			2
effectively it created morality police			0
in the early years of @entity53 rule , the public order courts were our bogeymen			0
girls who were deemed inappropriately dressed -- by the arbitrary metric of whichever officer happened to be on duty at the time -- were carted off in the back of police pick - up trucks in their hundreds , taken to be at best humiliated , and at worst flogged			0
even today , although the " diktats " , or rules on @entity49 dress have loosened , the occasional street sweep serves as a reminder of what still lies in wait should your behavior be ruled " un-islamic			1
" it was a public order court that sentenced @entity88 to death for apostasy , for her refusal to renounce @entity92 , a move that has left many of my @entity3 friends and family shocked			1
this comes as licenses to build new churches are routinely denied , permission for @entity103 festivities routinely blocked and rights activists tell us an estimated 200 foreign nationals were thrown out of @entity15 for " @entity29 evangelizing			2
" @entity109 's husband told me she was @entity29 when he met her and that he 's never met the men alleging she is their missing -- muslim -- sister called @entity115			0
her father , who @entity109 claims was n't involved in her upbringing , has yet to speak , either in court or publicly			0
international outrage and it 's these missing pieces of the puzzle that the government has clung to , trying to distract the growing domestic and international outrage			0
but it has n't escaped people 's notice that the press conference @entity109 's alleged brothers held was in a government hall , and that in a country where journalists are told not to broach certain topics , the statement by the man claiming to be her older brother was allowed to be freely published ; a statement announcing that the woman he claims as a sister must return to @entity49 or be killed " as a glory to the faith			2
" perhaps it 's because the " @entity154 " or consensus of the @entity49 community , which is taken as a guide in @entity49 jurisprudence , is not unified in the meting out of a death sentence for apostasy , although countries like @entity150 and @entity151 do have the law on their books			1
or maybe it 's because , even in a country that has found a way to live with the gunning down of protesters , the shrinking of freedom and allegations of government corruption and financial mismanagement , that seem to come almost daily , the death sentence of a mother - of - two for a crime that many here do n't think really counts , has allowed many to realize , at the very least , who we are not			1

after years of civil war , the majority @entity185 of @entity15 chose to secede
border squabbles and skirmishes over the division of oil wealth are still the norm
@entity194 on @entity49 dress have loosened -- but there is the occasional street sweep
the death sentence for apostasy has left many @entity3 shocked
