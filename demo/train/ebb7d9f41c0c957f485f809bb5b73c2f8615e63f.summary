-- in 1954 , wanderlust , a desire previously associated with nomads and hobos , officially became a competitive sport			1
a clique of frequent fliers -- before the term was co-opted by the airline industry -- banded together to start the @entity10			1
to join , members needed a minimum of 100 country stamps in their passports			1
rivalries between members and various groups eventually became cutthroat			1
factions duked it out over what qualified as an official destination : the @entity22 now claims 193 countries ; @entity10 , 321 countries and territories ; and @entity26 offers 873 places to methodically cross off your list			1
other issues included how much dust has to gather on a traveler 's boots before a visit counts			1
the bickering got so contentious that @entity36 discontinued its listing for " world 's most traveled person			1
" today , the @entity10 has more than 2,000 members and 20 regional chapters , and no surprise , the competition for the crown of most traveled remains intense			1
at latest count , there were four affiliate groups with members who tick off destinations the way birders might tick off white - throated needletails or upland sandpipers			1
ultra-travelers for the most part , members of these rarefied groups ( many belong to more than one ) enjoy camaraderie and comparing notes			1
after all , who else could they consult for tips on the best b&b in @entity64 ? or commiserate with over the three times they attempted to tick off @entity67 , only to fail , three weeks and $ 25,000 later , because the icebergs were too massive for the ship to break through ? " more than anything , @entity10 is a social group , " says @entity70 , chairman of the @entity72 , @entity73 - based organization			1
" it started at country clubs in @entity76 before jets and the ability to get places caused an explosion of travel agents			1
" in many ways , it was one of few places you could swap travel tales and learn that if you stay at this place versus that place , you 'll be right on the beach and have the chance to meet the owner and his daughter who works as the chef			1
" ' this title cost me six marriages ' over the years , with new ways to parse destinations and titles -- endorsements and websites have come , too -- the social interaction part has become more competitive			1
at age 37 , @entity103 became the youngest person to bag all 321 countries and territories on the @entity10 's list			1
some then thought he went too far in attempting to take over the coveted @entity110 title by adding more official destinations to the list			2
@entity114 , for example , is by some official counts part of the @entity116 ; @entity103 wanted it counted on its own			2
@entity119 , an attorney from @entity120 and at the time the decade - long record holder of " world 's most traveled man , " got his travel shorts in a knot			1
as he said before he died in 2008 , " this title cost me six marriages , and i do not intend to surrender my sword lightly			2
" @entity129 is another road warrior who has walked across @entity132 , sailed across the @entity133 and reached the mountain summit of every continent , including @entity136			2
he contends that he 's seen far more of the world than @entity103 , who , after selling his successful high - tech company at the height of the dot - com boom , became so focused on marking off countries that he logged all but 70 of the club 's 321 in three years			1
the one thing all these modern day @entity146 agree upon is this : naysayers who insist an obsession to collect passport stamps is an inferior way to travel are simply spitting sour grape seeds			1
we 'll ask you to decide			2
do these jet - lagged travelers suffer from dromomania , an uncontrollable psychological urge to wander ? or is all this scheming and plotting to get to the more obscure reaches of the globe a noble vocation ? here are arguments both ways			1
thirteen countries in two weeks does not an expert make neither does living for six weeks in @entity166			1
" who 's to say how long is long enough ? " asks @entity103			2
" if you stay a week , they 'll tell you you need three weeks			2
stay three weeks , they 'll say you need to spend the whole season			0
" you can never win that game			0
" as far as he 's concerned , " for a complete world view , you have to go everywhere			1
because the news media does n't begin to present an accurate picture			0
" @entity103 says the more information you can get on your own , the better			0
" five hundred countries is better than 400 , " he says			1
" every place you 're going to learn something new			0
" as of two weeks ago , @entity103 had been to 829 countries -- at least by his count on @entity185 , the site he started to help quell the @entity36 furor			1
travel is supposed to be fun			2
why do it this way ? getting to many destinations requires massive amounts of planning , time and cash			0
even then , it does n't always work out			0
@entity198 ( also known as @entity199 ) , a @entity197 territory leased to the @entity201 military halfway between @entity202 and @entity203 , usually requires hiring a @entity197 law firm to secure a permit			0
you 'll also need to inform the @entity201 military base located there that you 're not a @entity209 pirate ( so they 'll call down their missiles )			0
@entity67 , a @entity213 possession located between @entity202 and @entity214 , is covered in glacial ice and penguin guano			0
getting there requires cooperation from @entity219			0
you can pay the $ 25,000 for three attempts to get to the island , but there 's no guarantee			0
the @entity225 icebreakers that take you there might still be unable to make landfall			0
even @entity103 , one of a handful who has been to @entity230 , says there were times he was ready to throw in the towel			0
bragging about all the countries you 've visited makes you sound like a self - involved ass according to @entity70 , bragging is n't part of the program			2
rather , members seek out enlightening and useful conversation with others who share their hobby			2
it 's like finding a fellow @entity246 fan who caught their " @entity248 " tour at the @entity249 in @entity250			0
only a few will ever really " get it			0
" there 's enormous satisfaction to be had in meeting rare , kindred spirits			0
what 's the point of being in a country for a day or two , or for that matter , a few hours ? point taken , but @entity261 , a @entity197 - born businessman who holds the @entity36 record for most air miles logged ( a less contentious title than " ultimate traveler " ) , flips that sentiment on its head			0
over the years , @entity261 has n't just traveled a lot ; he 's amassed an impressive @entity269 © of experiences			0
he 's been serenaded by @entity271 ( " @entity272 " ) , spoken with @entity273 , had ribs with fellow first - class passenger @entity275 and played celebrity cricket with @entity277			0
he also calls @entity278 a friend and has more tales than @entity281			0
does all this really make you a better person ? in the end , " competitive travelers " generally make the case that the pursuit of travel stamps is really a way to better understand the world			1
sure , as @entity292 and @entity293 so eloquently put it , " we all know that people are the same wherever you go , " but it takes being in a place to truly understand its people and customs			0
or to understand how geography explains everything -- how rain falling on one side of a mountain and not the other radically affects how people live			0
" the more you travel , the more regional perspective you get , " @entity103 says			2
" it helps you relate to different types of people , and the world becomes more beautiful because of it			2
it helps you understand the chaos			0

@entity10 , for travel to 100 countries or more , has more than 2,000 members
one organization says there are a possible 873 " places " to visit in the world
competitive travelers claim the more places you visit , the more enlightened you become
