-- ever since a devastating earthquake struck @entity3 on january 12 followed by others in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , many people have asked the question , " are earthquakes getting worse ? " the answer is a firm and unequivocal " no. " i know it 's hard to believe given the devastation these earthquakes have caused and the intense level of media attention they have received			1
however , it turns out that large earthquake frequency has not changed at all over the last 20 years			2
but do n't take my word for it			2
go to the @entity23 website and see for yourself			0
as of april 25 , 2010 is on pace to have approximately 18 earthquakes larger than a magnitude 7 on the @entity28			1
that sure sounds like a lot , but it 's only one more than last year and very close to the 15.4 large earthquakes per year that @entity34 has averaged over the last 20 years			1
of course , some years are more active than others , but that is to be expected			0
in fact , in 1995 there were 20 of these large earthquakes , but nobody talks about that year as being particularly lively			2
the fact that several of this year 's large earthquakes occurred near populated areas only adds to the perception that the overall frequency or intensity of earthquakes has increased			1
before the earthquake in @entity3 , there had n't been an earthquake of that size in over two months			1
this ebb and flow of earthquakes is completely natural			2
and what about volcanic eruptions ? @entity23 records show they have also remained constant since the 1960s , with between 50 and 70 eruptions each year			0
over the last few days , another misconception began to emerge when @entity0 published an opinion article by author @entity62 titled " is the @entity34 striking back ? " the piece outlined a theory that , as glaciers melt due to global warming , the @entity34 's crust will begin to stretch and rebound			1
it goes on to imply that this stretching could cause not only earthquakes , such as in @entity3 and @entity5 , but also volcanic eruptions			1
the article even suggests this process is responsible for the recent eruption of @entity74 in @entity75 with its neighbor , @entity77			1
" threatening to detonate next			0
" do these studies exist ? yes			0
is this really what they say ? no. @entity82 , some background			0
the source of this idea is a series of papers published by the @entity88 in @entity89 that looked at the potential effect of climate change on some types of natural disasters			0
this idea is generally based on the well - known phenomenon that , as @entity34 's glaciers continue to melt , the crust rebounds as it is relieved of the burden			2
in fact , this has been happening for thousands of years since the peak of the last ice age			2
several of these papers did propose that climate change could affect certain types of earthquakes on the ocean floor or underneath melting glaciers , however , @entity3 is neither on the bottom of the ocean nor under a glacier			1
as for the @entity5 quake , it was caused by the incredible amount of pressure generated as two tectonic plates are forced together			1
the point is that not all earthquakes are caused by the same forces and earthquakes on the ocean floor or under glaciers could not be more different from earthquakes in @entity3 or @entity5			1
it 's like saying cigarettes cause lung cancer , therefore they cause skin cancer as well			2
the bottom line is that @entity62 's claims that earthquake frequency is increasing and that earthquakes in @entity3 and @entity5 are caused by global warming are unsupported by the scientific articles he uses to form his conclusions			1
the effect of his article is to take several well - meaning , preliminary , cautious and limited scientific studies and create unnecessary fear and confusion in the general public			0
if the public concludes that earthquake frequency has increased , it will be wrong			0
if it concludes that volcano eruption frequency or intensity has increased , it will be wrong			0
if it believes that earthquakes in @entity3 or @entity5 were caused by global warming , it will not only be wrong , but it will believe it because it was told it was the conclusion of geologists			1
most scientific papers do not lend themselves to sound bites or headlines			0
that means the media needs to do a much better job understanding them			0
for their part , scientists need to be willing to confront these errors before they spread			0
whatever effect climate change has on our planet in the future , inaccurate reporting of research leaves the public at a huge disadvantage and can not be tolerated			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			1

@entity170 says many people have asked if there 's an increase in earthquakes
he says quakes , volcanoes are occurring at average level
@entity170 says the @entity3 , @entity5 , @entity75 events are not related to global warming
only a certain class of quakes might be affected by melting ice sheets , he says
