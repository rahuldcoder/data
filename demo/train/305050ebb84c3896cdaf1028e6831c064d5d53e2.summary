-- shots were fired this week near the @entity3 border with @entity4 , with a @entity3 official saying they came from a @entity4 law enforcement helicopter , something that a @entity4 official denies			1
the @entity4 helicopter crossed into @entity12 and fired two shots near @entity3 border agents , a @entity3 law enforcement official said friday			1
no one returned fire , and the helicopter returned to @entity4			2
no one was hurt in the incident , which happened about 6 a.m. local time thursday about 100 yards into @entity3 territory , the official said on condition of anonymity			1
a separate official , @entity3 @entity25 spokeswoman @entity25 , confirmed the helicopter crossed into @entity3 territory , saying it happened at 5:45 a.m. thursday			1
she did not provide further details			0
@entity29 , director of the @entity4 attorney general 's investigative office , offered a different story friday			0
while acknowledging @entity4 authorities were conducting an operation " on the border , " @entity29 said , " i do not think we crossed the border because we brought our navigation			1
but it was just 100 meters from the border			0
" he said helicopters from the attorney general 's office and defense ministry " were shot at by criminals , " several of whom were later apprehended by @entity4 authorities			2
" the only ones doing the shooting were those that we have now detained , " @entity29 said			0
the first @entity3 source said that @entity4 authorities have called @entity3 authorities and acknowledged a mistake , saying shots were fired from the helicopter after it accidentally crossed the border			1

some of these have to do with efforts to corral the drug or weapons trade , with the latter being especially significant in @entity4 given fears that such arms could end up in the hands of powerful drug cartels			0
