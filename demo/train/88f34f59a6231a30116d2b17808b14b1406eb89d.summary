@entity0 -- which one of these does n't fit ? more jobs , a record stock market , wars ending and dismal poll numbers			0
all apply to @entity10 's presidency as it passes the 2,000 - day mark , raising questions about the viability of what used to be known as conventional political wisdom			1
a strengthening economy and robust stock market traditionally mean general public satisfaction with government			0
bringing soldiers home from war zones has always boosted presidential popularity			0
not this time with this president			2
a @entity1 compilation of recent national polls indicates only 41 % of @entity26 approve of @entity10 's handling of the job , down 6 percentage points from a year ago and matching the low of the past 12 months			1
why the disconnect ? a convergence of factors -- uneven economic growth , government crises both real and exaggerated , foreign policy problems , hyper - partisan @entity0 politics now on election - year steroids -- helps explain it			1
@entity10 to @entity40 : ' so sue me ' here 's a closer look at some of the issues involved : 1 ) @entity45 , but not for everyone another strong jobs report thursday added to growing evidence that @entity26 economy has hit its full stride after the recession @entity10 inherited when he took office in january 2009			1
a @entity54 statement noted the 288,000 jobs created in june contributed to the strongest start to a year since 1999 and the best six - month period overall since 2006			2
the unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 % , well below the almost 10 % level in the immediate aftermath of the recession as well as the more than 7 % level when @entity10 's presidency began			1
in addition , the job growth last month spread across the economy instead of coming mostly from low - paying sectors such as food and drink , as occurred previously , said @entity1 chief business correspondent @entity69			0
however , @entity71 noted that a low labor force participation rate showed many people " have simply just left the labor market			0
" those out of the labor market for more than a year still have trouble finding jobs , so little has changed for them , she said , adding : " it 's not all unicorns and rainbows			0
" @entity10 himself alluded to the sweet - and - sour economic situation on thursday , touting the positive report but adding that " there are still folks out there who are struggling			1
" " my hope is that the @entity26 people look at today 's news and understand that , in fact , we are making strides , " he said			0
2 ) who benefits from a strong stock market ? the jobs report that exceeded expectations of analysts sent the stock market to record heights , with the @entity101 crossing 17,000 for the first time			0
however , happiness on @entity104 does n't translate directly to satisfaction on @entity106 , noted @entity1 business correspondent @entity107			0
" only about half of @entity26 invest in stocks , " so the gains do n't matter to a lot of people , @entity107 said , adding that the stock market " is n't the economy			0
" in fact , the soaring exchanges sow resentment among non-investors who blame @entity104 greed for the near collapse of 2008 that contributed to the recession			0
as a @entity122 , @entity10 stands to benefit less from a healthy stock market than a @entity40 president from the party more traditionally tied to the banking - investment sector			1
3 ) wars ending , sort of @entity10 campaigned twice on ending the wars in @entity130 and @entity131 wars started by his predecessor , and he is on track to fulfill that promise			2
he withdrew @entity26 forces from @entity130 in 2011 , and almost all @entity26 forces will be out of @entity131 by the end of 2016 -- and his presidency -- under his plan			0
however , myriad issues cloud the return home of the troops			0
the lightning advance by @entity145 militants through northern @entity130 threatens renewed civil war and partition , raising fears of a jihadist - controlled safe haven for terrorists threatening @entity26 interests			0
that is the exact scenario the wars were supposed to end , and critics have accused @entity10 of allowing gains made in @entity130 to get erased after pulling out @entity26 forces			2
the @entity10 administration blames @entity130 prime minister @entity157 for his country 's collapse , saying the @entity161 leader rejected an agreement to keep @entity26 forces in the country and marginalized @entity145 and @entity165 populations in @entity130			1
now @entity10 is sending @entity26 forces back to @entity130 , by the hundreds so far , to bolster security and advise @entity130 forces			2
the label of military advisers evokes memories of how the @entity171 started			0
another problem involves chronic and sometimes deadly delays faced by returning war veterans seeking health care from the @entity176			0
the crisis reported by @entity1 since november already has brought the resignation of va secretary @entity179 , various investigations and a @entity54 report that essentially said the entire department needed an overhaul			0
4 ) governing woes the @entity186 crisis follows other problems in the @entity10 administration , such as the dysfunctional website for his signature health care reforms , @entity191 political targeting of groups seeking tax - exempt status and the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four @entity26 in @entity195 , @entity196			1
as expected , congressional @entity40 have mounted a series of investigations , some necessary and others intended to wring as much political capital out of the controversies as possible heading up to the november elections and beyond			2
they also adopted obstructionist tactics after getting overrun by @entity205 majorities in @entity10 's first term on transformative legislation such as the @entity208 and @entity104 reforms			1
the result : a gridlocked @entity211 of political one - upmanship , and a president who appears to have thrown up his hands in disgust by promising to act on his own as much as he can			2
" we can make even more progress if @entity211 is willing to work with my administration and to set politics aside , at least occasionally , " @entity10 said of thursday 's job report			1
no polling fireworks for @entity10 or @entity211 this july 4th republicans responded in kind , with @entity54 speaker @entity224 saying that " in order for us to make real progress , the president must do more than criticize			1
" " there 's no shortage of common ground where he can push his party 's leaders in the @entity230 to work with us , " @entity224 said in a swipe at legislative intransigence by @entity230			0
" until he provides that leadership , he is simply part of the problem			0
" if any solace for @entity10 , polls show the public dislikes @entity211 more than him , with the @entity1 compilation of recent surveys showing 14 % approval for the legislators			2
by seeking to blame @entity40 and declaring his intent to govern by regulation instead of legislation , @entity10 turns off voters who want to see the president engaged and trying , said @entity253 , a political scientist at @entity255			1
" he sort of looks like a kid on the playground who 's hiding , saying , ' forget it , i 'm not playing with you guys anymore , ' " @entity253 told @entity1 , adding that " even though it can be explained , the concept of a president giving up does n't sit well with people			1
" @entity10 is the same guy who won re-election in 2012 , she said , but now he comes off as powerless " when the truth is the executive branch structure is enormously powerful			2
" " the less @entity211 does , the more power the executive gets , " @entity253 observed			0
5 ) " nattering nabobs of negativism " speechwriter @entity274 came up with that phrase for former vice president @entity276 to complain about a liberal - leaning mainstream media during the @entity279 administration			1
now @entity10 faces the resulting backlash -- a vitriolic right - wing media machine that feeds and enhances @entity40 attack politics			1
from talk radio icon @entity284 to @entity286 to the rest of an industry spawned in the past two - plus decades , the conservative messaging reflects the deep ideological divide in the country			1
@entity10 has provided fodder to his detractors , getting cited for " @entity293 " in 2013 by @entity294 for his oft - repeated , erroneous declaration that his health care reforms meant " if you like your health care plan , you can keep it			1
" @entity253 credited the political right with " persuading people who do benefit from the federal government that they do n't " as part of the conservative effort to shrink the government 's size and cost			2
" democrats have failed miserably to counter that , " she said			0
now , 45 % of the public automatically opposes @entity10 , @entity26 's first @entity310 - @entity26 president , " no matter what , " she said , " whether racism or ideology or both			1
" who is the worst president since @entity317 ? opinion : @entity40 left @entity10 no choice but to act on immigration opinion : lies , damned lies , statistics and polls @entity1 's @entity326 contributed to this report .			1

issues that usually benefit a president not helping @entity10
much of the negativity reflects the nation 's partisan divide
right - wing media feeds and enhances @entity40 attacks
analyst : true or not , the president is *perceived* to be giving up
