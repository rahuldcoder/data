@entity0 , @entity1 -- you know a global scenario is serious when even @entity5 seems scared			2
developments in and around @entity7 are so worrisome that they appear to have frightened @entity8			1
the 72 - year - old former vice president stopped by to visit with @entity11 lawmakers tuesday and wound up talking about unpredictable , and perhaps unstable , @entity7 leader @entity12			1
according to sources present at the meeting , @entity8 offered this blunt assessment of the crisis in the @entity17 : " we 're in deep doo doo			1
" oh , that 's just terrific			2
it 's spring , and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in the nation 's capital			0
and so naturally our thoughts turn to ... the threat of thermonuclear war ? we interrupt the politically driven debates in @entity30 over gun control and immigration control to bring you an important message about a world leader who may be out - of - control			0
welcome to the @entity7 missile crisis			1
it 's time to think the unthinkable			0
in fact , if you live in @entity42 , @entity43 , the @entity44 or , as i do , on the @entity46 of the @entity47 -- or , for that matter , anywhere else within range of this bad neighborhood -- it 's probably long past time			1
just this week , @entity2 reported this : " the @entity55 administration now calculates it is likely @entity7 may test fire mobile ballistic missiles at any time based on the most recent @entity47 intelligence showing it is likely the @entity7 have completed all launch preparations			1
" and this : the official confirmed that @entity47 satellites are monitoring the @entity17 and ' the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch			2
' " and , a day later , it followed up with this : " countries in northeast @entity71 remained on edge wednesday amid warnings from @entity47 and @entity75 officials that @entity7 could carry out a missile test at any time			1
" @entity79 has deployed missile defense systems around @entity81 , some @entity78 tour groups have canceled visits to @entity7 and @entity47 radars and satellites are trained on an area of the @entity7 east coast where @entity12 's regime is believed to have prepared mobile ballistic missiles for a possible test launch			1
adm. @entity90 , commander of the @entity91 , did n't mince words when -- in remarks at a @entity94 hearing this week -- he characterized the crisis as " a clear and direct threat to @entity47 national security and regional peace and stability			1
" ok , @entity101 , you have @entity47 's attention -- and , for that matter , the world 's			2
what are you going to do now ? think very carefully about how you answer that question			0
it seems that there is not much that @entity47 leaders can do now but wait for @entity12 to make the next move			1
but that 's a high - stakes game , since he seems to be running out of moves that do n't involve a missile launch			0
as experts on the region have been saying all week , perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this crisis is that the @entity7 leader does n't appear to have left himself an exit door			1
if , after all this huffing and puffing and rattling of missiles , @entity12 simply backs down and goes back to fiddling with his @entity125 and making vacation plans with @entity127 , could his own military see that as a sign of weakness and stage a coup ? and so , the 30 - year - old despot may feel as if he has no choice but to finish the game			1
given the volatility of the situation , president @entity55 and his security team have to be ready -- in the event of a missile launch -- to immediately respond forcefully			0
a clear and unequivocal message that goes beyond diplomacy would have to be sent			0
the response has to leave no doubt that this administration is n't playing games -- and that it means business			0
that was the message that the heroic members of @entity148 delivered in tracking down and killing @entity149 in @entity150 last year			0
@entity55 's liberal base was overjoyed at the use of military force in dispatching @entity149 to the other world just before a presidential election			0
how could it object in this case , when once again @entity47 -- and our allies -- are being threatened ? that 's the question			2
if there 's an answer , let 's hear it			0
and for the sake of those of us who are closest to the doo doo , let 's hope we hear it soon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity8 gave @entity11 lawmakers a blunt assessment of *n.* @entity7 crisis
@entity173 says those who live on the @entity47 west coast are particularly *concerned*
he says the fear is that @entity12 backs himself into a corner
