@entity0 , @entity1 -- two fugitive brothers wanted in the much - publicized slaying of a @entity1 lawyer last year were being held at a military base tuesday , one day after they surrendered to authorities with a special @entity11 commission , the @entity3 said			1
@entity12 and @entity13 had been sought since december on charges that they masterminded the assassination of lawyer @entity16			1
the lawyer left behind a videotape saying that president @entity19 would be responsible if anything happened to him			1
the @entity21 in @entity1 , known by its @entity23 acronym @entity24 , determined that @entity16 orchestrated his own death in order to implicate @entity19 , whom he blamed for the recent slayings of two close friends			1
the @entity13 brothers were unaware that @entity16 duped them into carrying out his own slaying , @entity24 said in january , when the commission released the results of an eight - month investigation			1
@entity16 had told them told them he was being threatened by someone and wanted that person killed , the @entity24 investigation concluded			1
@entity19 had nothing to do with the killing , @entity24 said			2
the brothers ' surrender came suddenly monday morning when their lawyer called @entity24 headquarters at 8 a.m. and said they wanted to turn themselves in , said @entity46 , head of the @entity11 agency			1
the brothers were in custody less than a half hour later , @entity46 said at a news conference			1
the men chose to turn themselves in to @entity24 out of concern for their personal safety , said @entity46 , a @entity23 judge			2
they were handed over to @entity1 authorities			1
the brothers are being held at the @entity57 military base , said defense ministry spokesman col. @entity58			1
@entity16 was shot from behind in may 2009 in a brazen daylight attack while riding his bicycle in @entity0 , the nation 's capital			2
he was shot three times in the head , once in the neck and once in the back , @entity46 said in january when he presented the results of the investigation			1
the two brothers , who own a pharmaceutical company , had been cousins of @entity16 through a previous marriage and did not know that he was the target of the assassination , @entity46 said			1
@entity16 fed information to the hit squad leader that led to his own death , giving descriptions of what the target looked like and where he would be			1
" it was the two brothers and no one else , " @entity46 said			1
not a [ government ] minister			0
" about 300 investigators from 11 nations reached their conclusion after an exhaustive examination of 100,000 telephone calls , 9,500 documents , surveillance videotapes and 135 interviews with 11 suspects and others , @entity46 said			0
@entity19 had maintained since the may 10 slaying that he was innocent despite @entity16 's explosive videotape , which was made public the day after his death			1
before monday 's surrender by the brothers , @entity1 authorities had already arrested 11 men on suspicion that they carried out the killing			1
arrest warrants for the brothers were issued december 10 , @entity46 said			1
@entity16 recorded the tape blaming @entity19 three days before his death			2
he said @entity19 wanted him dead because the lawyer had been blaming the president and some of his top associates for the slaying of prominent businessman @entity115 and his daughter , @entity116 , the previous month			2
they were killed , @entity16 said , because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted			0
@entity16 was @entity115 's attorney			0
@entity46 indicated @entity16 staged his own killing to get back at @entity123 and high - level members of his government , whom he could not prove were responsible for the @entity115 killings			2
" he wanted to open a box of lightning and thunder , " @entity46 said			0
@entity46 pointed to several indicators of @entity16 's state of mind : his mother had died ; he was going through a second divorce , and his wife had taken their young children to @entity138 ; he was bereft at the slaying of @entity140 , with whom he had a close relationship ; and he felt a sense of powerlessness because he could not prosecute the people he believed were responsible for the @entity115 slayings			0
may 10 , the date of his killing , was @entity148			0
in two april 21 e-mails , seven days after the @entity115 killings , @entity16 wrote , " i ca n't stop crying " and " i feel like i 'm disintegrating , " @entity46 said			2
@entity16 made out his last will and testament on april 24 and started going public with his accusations against @entity19 regarding the @entity115 slayings on may 3			0
on may 4 , he called a meeting at his law office and said he would be leaving the firm , in which he was a partner			0
the next day , @entity46 said , @entity16 asked a friend to buy two cell phones anonymously			0
those cell phones , the lead investigator said , were crucial to cracking the case			0
@entity16 used one of the phones to call threats to his personal cell phone and had the other delivered to the @entity13 brothers , who gave it to the hit squad leader			2
@entity16 then used the new cell phone he kept to give instructions to the hit squad leader through the second phone , @entity46 said			0
@entity46 detailed how the slaying apparently was meant to be paid through a check of about $ 40,000			0
according to the investigator , @entity16 told his secretary before his death that she would be receiving a check from @entity178 that should be delivered to the @entity13 brothers			1
the check had been made out by @entity180 , a @entity16 friend and business associate who at the time was @entity1 's minister of communication , @entity46 said			1
@entity180 resigned from office in june , a few weeks after the slaying			0
after receiving the check , @entity185 destroyed it , @entity46 said			0
the businessman paid the 300,000 quetzales ( $ 35,900 ) for the assassination out of his own pocket , @entity46 said			0
@entity180 is the brother of @entity191 , the president of the @entity193 , and a cousin of @entity195 , who was president @entity19 's private secretary at the time			0
in his videotape , @entity16 said @entity195 would be among those responsible for the lawyer 's death if it happened			1
" if you are reading this message , it means that i , @entity16 , was murdered by the president 's private secretary , @entity195 , and his associate @entity208 , with the approval of mr. @entity19 and [ first lady ] @entity211 , " @entity16 said			0
after the tape surfaced , @entity19 went on national tv with a strong denial that he or anyone mentioned in the video was involved			0
he expressed his sense of vindication in a televised speech in january			0
" i do n't have any rancor in my heart , " @entity19 said			2
" just immense gratitude for those who waited patiently with us			0
" the @entity11 established the @entity21 in @entity1 in 2006 to investigate corruption and political violence			1
more than 200,000 people have been killed in the nation since 1970 , mostly as a result of organized crime , drug - trade violence and a 36 - year civil war that ended in 1996			2
there were 6,451 slayings in @entity1 in 2009 , in which only 230 verdicts were achieved , @entity46 said			1
that means , he said , that more than 96 percent of the killings last year were not solved			2
