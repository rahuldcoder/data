the new year will be the year the nation really starts to experiment with marijuana			1
it wo n't be the year legalization sweeps the country ; it will be a year of wait and see			1
indeed , 2014 will see the legalization movement gain greater political strength while facing the possibility of setbacks if the implementation of new laws fails			1
it will also be a year of momentum - building			1
advocacy groups will build on their recent ballot successes and work hard assisting implementation of new laws in @entity17 and @entity18			1
it may not be a flashy year ; it may not be a headline - grabbing year , but it will be a critical year for the future of legalization advocacy			1
in 2013 , @entity18 and @entity17 built the administrative infrastructure to ready their states for the legal sale of marijuana after successful 2012 ballot initiatives			1
those initiatives were among the biggest victories to date for the legalization movement			0
of course , those successes did n't come about by accident			0
they were largely because legalization advocates -- over the course of many years -- transformed the movement into a mature , organized set of interest groups			1
these well - funded , expertly staffed groups showed themselves to be a political force with statewide ballot initiatives and increasingly in elections			2
demonstrating the increasing acceptance of marijuana , the founder of a medical marijuana store , a respected businessman , was voted mayor of @entity48 , @entity49 , last month			2
opinion : finally , a nation legalizes pot statewide victories were complemented by local - level initiatives			2
successes in places like @entity57 , @entity58 , and @entity59 , @entity60 , will probably generate greater energy in other cities , like @entity18 , that are considering legalization			1
building on this trend , groups will continue to develop as a politically savvy and powerful interest			2
in the world of lobbying , nothing breeds success ( or raises funds ) like prior success , and the past 14 months mean the movement will grow in numbers and financial capacity			2
on a grass - roots level , organizations like @entity77 and the @entity78 will continue to show people that support for legalization is no longer taboo			0
instead , it is a serious issue that deals with public health , regulation , taxation and budgeting			0
these groups have done well to frame the issue not as a dorm - room debate but as a public policy problem			1
those efforts pull supporters out of the shadows ; they will continue in 2014			2
in 2014 , marijuana advocacy organizations will also continue to do something unheard of in today 's @entity96 politics : unite @entity96			1
this is one of the most remarkable , rarely discussed aspects of the movement			0
they do n't just bring together like - minded @entity96			0
they often bring together groups who normally bitterly oppose each other			2
liberals join hands with libertarians			0
wealthy white voters who see marijuana laws as outdated join with non-white voters who see the enforcement of marijuana laws as discriminatory			2
children of the 1960s join with their grandchildren who wo n't retire until even as late as the 2060s			0
on many issues , these groups have different views , but on legalization , many people find common ground			2
all those who think it should be legal to inhale may be the ones who breathe fresh air into @entity96 politics			2
they will produce policy solutions in a system that consistently fails to do anything of note			0
the gains for supporters of legalization will be on display in 2014			0
but something else will happen behind the scenes this year that will be absolutely critical for the movement			0
advocates are planning statewide efforts , similar to those in @entity17 and @entity18			1
organizations in places like @entity144 and @entity145 , among other states , are considering legalization ballot initiatives in the coming years			0
however , elected officials and voters may well take a wait - and - see approach			0
@entity17 's and @entity18 's experiences will affect voters in future legalization efforts			1
if those states have a positive experience with legalization -- dispelling opponents ' concerns about addiction , traffic safety and crime --- and it adds to their budgets , others will be more open to legalization			0
advocacy groups will face a flourishing political landscape			1
if , however , the experiences in those states are negative -- implementation goes awry , programs become cost - inefficient or public health concerns arise -- the movement will stumble			1
advocates are not leaving that outcome to chance			0
in a show of how serious they are about legalization - as - public - policy , they are actively assisting states in implementation			1
if the movement will continue to succeed , it must be actively committed to making implementation work and work well			0
if the experience of the @entity185 in 2013 has shown us anything , it is that implementation matters			0
botched rollouts , unforeseen bumps in the road and other challenges hurt advocates and embolden opponents			0
in this way , 2014 is the start of experimentation with marijuana			1
it might not be a flashy year for the movement or the opposition			0
but 10 years from now , legalization advocates may look back at this year and note that it was make or break for the movement , making 2014 one of the most crucial years for marijuana policy .			1

2014 is the year the nation starts to experiment with legal marijuana , @entity207 says
he writes that other states will watch what happens in @entity17 , @entity18 *closely*
@entity207 : organized advocacy groups took debate out of dorm room to policy makers
he says groups will help states with implementation , crucial for success
