@entity0 -- consumer technology giants are battling to provide the place where you store your files , and @entity6 is not about to be left out			1
capping a slew of software announcements on monday , @entity6 unveiled @entity9			1
the free service lets users synchronize documents , photos and applications between @entity6 devices over the @entity16			1
music purchased through the @entity18 can be downloaded from any device connected to your account , and for an annual fee , tracks bought from other stores , ripped from cds or procured through other means can be synchronized			0
when @entity9 drops this fall , @entity6 will join @entity27 and @entity28 , two major players that have already begun rolling out storage services			1
for music , @entity6 has the incumbent 's advantage			1
@entity34 is the world 's most popular jukebox software , highest - volume music retailer and already has cozy ties to the record industry			2
that relationship enabled @entity6 to secure the deals that competitors are still negotiating for			1
those agreements resulted in @entity44 , which was @entity6 ceo @entity46 ' signature " one more thing " to end his presentation on monday			1
( " it 's a small thing , " he said			0
) @entity51 will allow people to pay $ 25 per year to sync as many as 25,000 songs not purchased through the @entity18 between their computers and gadgets			0
" it takes minutes , not weeks , " @entity46 said			0
the weeks - long process @entity46 is referring to is the offerings from @entity27 and @entity28			1
because they have n't secured rights with the record labels , they took an alternate route with their services			2
@entity27 's @entity65 and @entity28 's @entity66 require users to upload their entire libraries to each service before they can be accessed from web and mobile jukeboxes			1
@entity6 , instead , uses a " scan - and - match " procedure , finding which of your songs are also sold in the @entity18 and giving you the keys to access those			1
for the remainder of live recordings and other obscure songs you have , the system uploads them , just like other services do , but at a fraction of the time			0
" we think we 've got a great system here , " @entity46 said			0
" this is the first time we 've seen this in the music industry			0
" music files bought from @entity27 can be automatically stored in a user 's @entity65			1
@entity28 does not have a music store			1
@entity65 offers 5 gigabytes ( about 1,000 songs ) free , and provides an extra 20 gigabytes for a year to customers who buy an album from @entity27 's @entity98			1
each gigabyte after that costs $ 1			0
@entity28 's music service is free this year if you can procure an invitation to join , and @entity28 has not announced pricing for after that			1
@entity6 's @entity9 provides 5 gigabytes at no charge for e-mail , documents and backup file storage			1
music , books , apps and pictures do n't count against that total			0
@entity9 will only store photos for 30 days			1
@entity6 did not say how much it will cost to lease @entity16 hard - drive space after filling up on e-mail and such			2
" we want people to see what these devices can really do and what the software can do			0
so we 're making it free , " @entity46 said			0
@entity27 's @entity65 can also store photos and video , but those files do count against a user 's total			1
@entity27 has e-book and app stores that provide similar syncing features as part of the package , but it does n't offer e-mail			2
@entity28 breaks its offerings up into a series of applications and storage lockers			1
music beta is currently storing 20,000 songs free			0
@entity141 provides 7.6 gigabytes of free storage and sells more			0
@entity143 can keep a gigabyte of files free and charges 25 cents for each extra gigabyte			0
@entity147 has an equivalent pricing scheme for photos			0
@entity28 also has an e-book store and has begun offering video services beyond @entity152 for home movies			1
@entity154 also offers e-mail and document storage			0
@entity6 has integrated @entity9 tightly into the mobile and computer systems it makes , starting with @entity159 and @entity160 , which debut next month and in the fall , respectively			1
files are saved and pushed to @entity6 's servers automatically			2
@entity6 will also have websites for accessing e-mail , calendar and other features , as well as allowing @entity171 - @entity170 users to sync photos to a folder			2
do n't bet on seeing apps for @entity28 's @entity176 phones or for @entity177			2
@entity6 has tried this sort of thing before with @entity180 , which cost $ 99 per year and was less ambitious in scale			2
it was viewed as a flop and experienced some embarrassing outages			0
shortly after the launch of the now three - year - old web service , @entity46 assembled the team who developed it and told them : " you 've tarnished @entity6 's reputation , " according to a story in @entity191			1
@entity46 acknowledged the failure humbly and with good humor on monday			0
" why should i believe them ? they 're the ones that brought me to @entity180 , " @entity46 said , mimicking the potential response to @entity9 from critics			2
" it was n't our finest hour			0
let me just say that			0
but we learned a lot			0
" @entity27 and @entity28 have a proven track record in delivering vast amounts of information over the @entity206			1
but @entity46 says @entity6 is ready this time			2
" if you do n't think we 're serious about this , you 're wrong , " he said , before transitioning to pictures of a massive facility @entity6 built in @entity211 , @entity212 : " this is our third data center that we just completed			2
... it 's rather large			0

@entity6 is preparing to launch @entity9 , an *internet* storage service
@entity27 already has @entity65 , and @entity28 has a variety of services
@entity9 is tightly integrated into @entity6 software but *seemingly* less so in other *platforms*
