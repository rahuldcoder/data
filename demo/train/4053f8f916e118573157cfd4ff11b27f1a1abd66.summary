-- last week a leaked draft of a report by the @entity3 warned that climate change will have severe ramifications for the global food supply , making it harder for crops to survive and leading to rising food prices			0
this report , scheduled for publication in march , provides the latest evidence of the dramatic impacts that the shifting climate is already beginning to have on the planet and on human societies			0
clearly , climate change is a global challenge unlike any other we face , which is why i , along with a small but growing number of progressives , support a unique and potentially surprising solution to it			0
it is time for policymakers to recognize that nuclear power must be a robust part of our nation 's energy plan to reduce carbon emissions			1
these may seem like strange words coming from a liberal whose family has been active in progressive politics , and who grew up on a @entity40 goat farm in a home heated by wood fires			1
like many of my fellow progressives , i care deeply about the environment and the future of our planet , which is precisely why i do not think we should be reflexively shutting the door on a technology that may be able to help address global climate change			0
energy production is the largest single contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions			2
some people believe that we can solve climate change by reducing global energy demand and switching to solar , wind , and other renewable energy sources			2
but , as i 've seen first hand in @entity65 , people in the developing world are consuming an increasing amount of energy as they seek to live the modern lives that we in the @entity69 enjoy			2
as a result , studies show that energy demand is actually poised to triple , or even quadruple , over the next century			0
as much as we might instinctively prefer renewable energy sources like solar and wind to meet this energy demand , last year solar provided a mere 0.1 percent of @entity65 's electricity , while wind provided just 3.5 percent -- and that is after at least $ 34 billion was funneled into clean energy projects from the @entity83 stimulus package			1
meanwhile , 19 % of @entity85 electricity comes from nuclear power plants ; that number rises to 60 % among clean energy sources			1
we need all the help we can get from renewable energy , but it 's a risky bet that wind and solar alone will be able to provide 100 % of @entity65 's energy , let alone meet a global energy demand three times the size it is today			1
if we are going to address climate change and help the global poor live longer , healthier lives , then , we need to begin a vigorous public discussion about other low - carbon energy options that are quickly scalable -- including nuclear power			1
whatever your view , this is a conversation worth having			0
my own interest in creating a dialogue about nuclear energy inspired me to become one of the backers of the independent documentary , " @entity114 , " which chronicles the conversion stories of prominent environmentalists who have become pro-nuclear			1
in our sharply divided political culture , there is a real shortage of these kinds of conversations			0
i believe both sides of the spectrum desperately need to open up more actual conversations rather than shutting down ideas and possibilities			1
after the failures of cap and trade and the @entity130 climate treaty , nuclear energy could be a place where left and right find common ground on energy			1
only if we are willing to reexamine our previous assumptions , and open up new spaces for dialogue , will we have any chance of addressing our nation 's many complex challenges			2
i know that many people , my fellow liberals in particular , are deeply skeptical about nuclear energy			2
but whatever you believe , i encourage you to do some research on nuclear energy -- and to do so with an open mind			1
after all , the root of the word " progressive " is " progress , " and i believe progress only happens with enough openness to arrive at new solutions			0

self - described liberal who 's active in progressive politics supports nuclear power
@entity164 : policymakers should make nuclear a robust part of @entity85 energy plan
both sides desperately need to open up more actual conversations
