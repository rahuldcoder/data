@entity1 , @entity0 -- forty seven - year - old @entity9 " adrenaline junkie " @entity3 will attempt to break the 50 - knot sailing speed barrier with his half sailboat , half plane , after a serious crash last summer			1
the half sailboat , half plane uses technology known as supercavitation -- sailing just above the water 's edge			1
@entity3 , a shipyard owner and yachtsman , is intent on beating the @entity18 - set record within the next few weeks , with the " @entity19 , " a canoe - style pod with a nine meter - long rigid sail			1
the @entity19 is waiting for confirmation from the @entity24 to attempt , once again , an unprecedented technology known as " supercavitation " -- sailing just above the water in a gas bubble created by the deflection of water			1
this is to to reduce the drag which is around 1,000 times greater in the water than in the air			2
" @entity19 is so exciting as we push to sail up to three times the speed of the wind , " @entity3 told @entity2			1
in october last year @entity3 and his co-pilot crashed when they lost control of the vessel at 42 knots -- over 60 miles per hour			1
but after re-building and perfecting the vessel at a cost of half a million dollars , @entity3 is ready to try again			1
" the exhilaration of sailing / flying is so big , you do n't think about danger , " he told @entity2			2
@entity3 is certain that this time around he will beat the record			1
" my only concern is we wo n't be able to keep control of the craft			0
" in case the pilots crash again , @entity3 says the most thing is to remain calm			2
" last time i felt a mild panic as we were underwater			0
i just hoped the paramedics would get there in time			0
" but really i feel very safe doing anything on water as that what i 've done my whole life			0
i feel most ' in tune ' when i 'm on water , " he added			0
the idea for @entity19 was conceived four years ago by @entity3 after he was inspired by the story of @entity66 , the @entity67 who set a world land speed record on his modified @entity71 motorcycle in 1967 -- played by @entity72 in the 2005 @entity74 movie " @entity75			1
" do you think the wotrocket can beat the record ? " i came up with the idea in the shower			0
so i presented it to a group of engineers and said ' this is what i believe			0
' most said i 'm a lunatic but one said ' i want to work with you '			0
" @entity3 joined forces with leading @entity9 designer @entity87 and sought input from @entity89 747 pilots for their aeronautical knowledge			2
he then had the " @entity19 " built using the staff and facilities at his various @entity94			2
finally , he teamed up with @entity96 founder @entity95 who invested in the project because , as he explained , he " likes leftfield ideas			0
" " my family think i 'm crazy , but every time i 've had an idea it 's taken me somewhere			0
it 's really about ideas versus science and trying to make it work , " @entity3 explained			1
" and no one remembers the second man to walk on the moon			0

half sailboat , half plane will attempt to break the 50 - knot sailing speed barrier
pilot @entity3 crashed dangerously last year but is *confident* he can make it
" @entity19 " uses technology called " supercavitation : " sailing just above the water
