-- @entity1 has agreed to allow two @entity3 warships to cross through the @entity4 in a move that puts the country 's new military regime in a prickly position with its @entity10 neighbor			1
the @entity13 caretaker government gave the green light to the @entity3 warships friday , state media reported			1
they are expected to be the first @entity3 warships to sail through the @entity18 since the @entity20 's 1979 revolution			1
the canal is an internal body of water , and as such , @entity1 has sovereignty over it			1
but @entity1 also is bound by the 1978 @entity26 , which guarantee the right of free passage by ships belonging to @entity10 and all other nations on the basis of the @entity32 of 1888			1
before that , @entity1 did not allow @entity10 ships to sail through the canal			1
last week , @entity1 's newly empowered military government said it would honor all its international treaties			2
" this is awkward -- at a minimum , " said @entity40 , director of the program on @entity42 at the @entity43			0
@entity40 said the @entity3 had asked for a frigate -- the @entity46 -- and a military supply ship -- the @entity48 -- to cross into the @entity49			1
both are armed with missiles , he said , adding that their passage would create more uncertainty in the region			2
it raises tension , particularly in this time of transition in @entity1 , " @entity40 said			2
" this is typical of @entity61 - @entity3 opportunism			2
" @entity1 's decision , analysts said , could show the direction that the military caretakers intend to take the @entity42 world 's most populous nation			2
" it does raise an unwelcome political issue that has to be resolved , " said @entity68			0

@entity3 said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence - gathering and training mission to prepare cadets to defend @entity3 's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by @entity83 pirates , according to the semi-official @entity84			1
asked about @entity3 's assertion that the ships are going to @entity61 for training , @entity86 spokesman @entity85 said friday , " my initial response to that would be we 're highly skeptical of that			1
" asked whether he was concerned about the ships ' travel plans , he said , " it 's not really about the ships			0
it 's what are the ships carrying , what 's their destination , what 's the cargo on board , where is it going , to whom , for what benefit			0
we have , you know , ongoing concerns			0
" those concerns were shared by the @entity109 , where press secretary @entity110 told reporters aboard @entity112 , " we 're monitoring that , obviously , but we also would say that @entity3 does not have a great track record for responsible behavior in the region , which is always a concern for us			1
" @entity10 foreign minister @entity117 said @entity10 's allies should pay close attention to the situation			0
" we expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the @entity3 provocations , designed to deteriorate the situation in the area , and put the @entity3 in their place , " he said			0
the @entity10 @entity127 said it was monitoring the movement of the @entity3 ships and alerted its allies			2
the @entity4 is a key waterway for international trade			0
it connects the @entity49 with the @entity134 , allowing ships to navigate between @entity136 and @entity137 without having to go around @entity138			0
millions of barrels of oil move through the @entity18 every day en route to @entity136 and @entity142 .			0

they 're expected to be the first such ships to sail through the canal since 1979
