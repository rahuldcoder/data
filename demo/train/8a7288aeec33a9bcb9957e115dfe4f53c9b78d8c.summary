-- after thursday 's vice presidential debate , @entity2 's @entity1 was emphatic that moderator @entity8 's question about the role of the candidates ' faith in their positions on abortion had " absolutely no business in a government that has a separation of church and state			1
" in the now - famous words of vice president @entity17 , " that 's a bunch of malarkey			2
" all of us are guided by an internal code of morality , whether it is dictated by religion or by personal responsibility to humankind			2
both rep. @entity24 and @entity17 were explicit that their faith informs all of their decision - making , and that includes issues related to a woman 's body			2
" i do n't see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith , " @entity24 said			2
@entity17 echoed his sentiments , saying his religion " defines " who he is and has " particularly informed " his social doctrine			0
( the difference in their approaches lies in @entity17 's refusal to shape national abortion policy according to his personal beliefs , an important distinction for candidates to make			1
) while abortion is often framed as a matter of rights ( with many women supporting it merely on principle rather than personal necessity ) , its implications for women go far beyond the mere theoretical			1
for so many women , especially the 25 million women who are currently living in poverty , the ability to control when and whether they have children is the critical link to their family 's economic security			0
with so much of the presidential race focused on the economy , it is unfortunate that the campaigns have not drawn attention to the impact that unintended childbearing has on a woman 's personal economy			0
more than 10 % of @entity78 families are thrust into poverty within one month of the birth of a child			0
since the @entity78 is one of just a handful of industrialized countries worldwide that does n't mandate paid maternity leave , a new mother in @entity78 may be forced to return to work immediately after her child 's birth			0
and that is only if she is amongst the privileged few who is able to return to work at all			0
with the cost of child care exceeding the average cost of rent in half of all states , this woman may not be able to afford the child care she needs to continue working			0
millions of @entity78 women are one unintended pregnancy away from financial despair			0
where a candidate stands on reproductive rights influences everything from health care coverage to economic issues to basic human rights , all extremely relevant to a voter 's complete understanding of a presidential candidate and his closest advisers			1
the impact of a candidate 's religion on these issues matters			2
for women specifically , whose perspectives are often shaped differently from men 's due to biological factors and historical inequality , an explanation of a candidate 's position on abortion -- and the moral or religious justification that influenced that position -- is valuable in determining far more than the availability of a common medical procedure			1
in fact , a candidate 's full stance on abortion symbolizes their understanding of the realities of women 's lives and the actions necessary to enable @entity78 parents to live up to their responsibilities			1
can the candidate reconcile anti-abortion religious teachings with respect for the legal right to make reproductive choices that impact the direction of women 's lives ? will the candidate 's religion affect his or her support of policies that enable women to achieve equal success to men ? @entity8 was a fantastic moderator			1
she challenged two wealthy , deeply religious men to articulate their spiritual basis for positions that have enormous significance to the vast majority of @entity78 women who do n't see themselves represented in political conversations about their bodies			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			1
