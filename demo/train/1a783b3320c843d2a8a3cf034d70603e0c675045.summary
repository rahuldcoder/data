-- it 's a hold - your - breath kind of place			1
@entity4 , one of the world 's greatest treasures , this weekend marks the 100th anniversary of its rediscovery by explorer @entity10			1
this majestic and mysterious ancient @entity13 settlement sits in splendid repose high on an @entity16 mountaintop			1
the well - preserved site is the leading tourist attraction in @entity19 , the third - largest country in @entity20			1
if you are planning to experience its magic , here are some things you 'll need to know : getting within range most visitors fly to @entity28 , @entity19 's capital , then fly southeast to @entity29 , located in a deep @entity16 valley			1
you 'll need to spend a few days there to get acclimated to the higher elevation , nearly 11,000 feet above sea level			1
@entity29 was once the capital of the @entity13 world , but today it 's a city that comfortably caters to the hordes of visitors who stop over			1
after catching your breath , it 's time to travel to @entity4			1
most tourists take the train and there are different classes of service , from inexpensive to luxury			1
if you 're taking the train , make your reservations early , particularly in the high season from may to september			1
@entity52 folks will hike the @entity53 , which can take three or four grueling days to complete and is no walk in the park			1
the number of people allowed on the trail each day is limited , so you 'll need to book with an @entity53 outfitter months in advance and arrange for permits			1
reaching the mountain trains take explorers to @entity66 , a neat and tidy town at the base of the mountain where @entity4 rests			1
you buy two important tickets in the town center : bus tickets to @entity4 and entrance tickets for the ruins themselves ( you ca n't buy tickets to the ruins at the entrance )			1
purchase @entity4 tickets at the @entity80 in @entity66			1
it 's best to bring cash for the tickets , although there is an atm in town			1
you can also buy advance tickets to @entity4 in @entity29 at the @entity89			1
tickets cost about $ 44			1
buy tickets for the bus before you get on at the ticket office near the departure point			2
the ticket office opens and the first buses head to @entity4 around 5 a.m. the bus ride up the mountain takes 20 minutes but seems like forever , negotiating the stomach - churning switchback road to the top			2
seeing @entity4 it is also called the @entity102 , imperious and fortresslike on the mountain summit			2
@entity4 means " @entity104 " in @entity105 , the language of the @entity13			2
this old mountain is often covered in clouds , and the sheer drop at the edges of the ruins can be unsettling			2
there are two very distinct sections			2
the agricultural area leads to the impressive urban sector , where the religious , astronomical and residential structures still stand			2
the entire site is about two square miles			2
the @entity13 worshipped what they knew and built an impressive @entity120 high above the residential zone			2
the days of the solstice were deeply special and spiritual to them			2
but there are also impressive places where the residents lived and worked , even spent time in prison for offenses committed			2
what 's the mystery ? @entity102 is not only enshrouded in mist but also in mystery			0
no one knows precisely its genesis , intended purpose , how many lived there or why they left			0
it appears to date from the period of the two great @entity13 , @entity140 ( 1438 - 71 ) and @entity141 ( 1472 - 93 ) , according to the @entity142			0
@entity10 found @entity4 -- purely by accident -- on july 24 , 1911 , while heading a @entity145 expedition to @entity19			0
he was camping along the river near @entity66 when he met a local campesino , or farmer , named @entity149			0
he led @entity150 up from the river to what were then jungle - covered ruins atop the @entity104			0
and the rest , as they say , is history			0
@entity10 was actually looking for the famed ruins of @entity157 , some 60 miles away , known as the last stronghold of the @entity13			0
the @entity13 were chased relentlessly by @entity160 conquistadors , who began subjugating @entity19 in 1533			0
the @entity160 probably never knew about @entity4 , either , because they pursued the @entity13 in the opposite direction			0
the best way to experience the @entity102 @entity4 is too important to rush			0
most tourists spend part of just one day at the site			0
they arrive in @entity66 in midmorning by train , visit the @entity102 for a few hours , then catch the late afternoon trains back to @entity29			1
i think it 's worth staying over in the town known for its hot springs and cold - running rivers			0
@entity66 offers plenty of shops , restaurants and hotels			0
begin your visit early in the day and stay late , when crowds thin and you 'll feel you have @entity4 all to yourself			1
the ruins are open from dawn to dusk every day			0
a stay of two days is optimal			0
on the first you can see every nook and cranny of the ancient settlement			0
then on the second day , you can attempt to climb the mountains adjoining @entity4			0
one is @entity189 , which means " @entity190			0
" healthy hikers can make the trip in about an hour , but the path is very steep			1
if you ca n't make that trek , there are two smaller peaks : @entity198 , which is the smallest , and @entity199			1
@entity4 is unquestionably a popular place			0
in fact , many scientists worry that the relentless crush of crowds is harming the ruins and could cause the @entity102 to fall down the side of the mountain as soils shift but for now the crowds still come			1
every day is unique and mystical at @entity4			0
take your time and see it in all its glory			0
@entity213 works at @entity0 and is also the creator and host of " the @entity216 , " which airs on @entity218 public television stations and @entity219			0
@entity0 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			0

make train reservations early , especially from may to september
@entity53 hikers need permits and should book with an outfitter months in advance
visit the @entity230 early in the morning or late in the afternoon for smaller crowds
