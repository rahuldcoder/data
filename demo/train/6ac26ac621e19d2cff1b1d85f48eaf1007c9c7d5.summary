@entity0 -- @entity3 ' boyhood dream of a military career ended when he was hit by an improvised explosive device during a patrol a few years ago in @entity7			2
" laying in that hospital bed ... sometimes i felt i 'd rather ( have ) died , " @entity3 said			2
" my life came to a complete halt			2
" @entity3 sustained severe blast injuries that led to his medical discharge and put him on medical disability			0
like many soldiers wounded in @entity15 and @entity16 , he found the transition to civilian life difficult			2
but he and a handful of other injured veterans have gotten help from what may seem an unlikely source : a custom homebuilder in @entity0 , @entity25			2
@entity26 presented @entity27 and his wife with an unexpected gift : a home built especially for them , mortgage - free			1
that 's all i can say , " @entity33 said , sobbing and clutching her stunned husband 's arm when @entity26 surprised them with the house			1
for @entity26 , a 2010 @entity42 , giving wounded veterans a place to call home is his way of saying thanks			1
since 2005 , his organization has built 44 houses through a national campaign called @entity48			2
@entity26 spent 30 years making upscale clients ' dream houses a reality			1
but he found a new mission in 2005 when he met with @entity53 about a very different type of project			0
@entity53 's 20 - year old son , a @entity57 , had been seriously injured in @entity15			1
@entity53 desperately needed to remodel his house to accommodate his son 's wheelchair			1
" i had no idea how i was going to pay for it , " @entity53 said			0
" i just knew that i had to get it done			0
" as a favor to a friend , @entity26 went to advise @entity53 on remodeling his house			1
it was a meeting that changed @entity26 's life			1
he remembers @entity53 showing him photos of his son @entity69			0
" he was a big , strapping @entity57 , " @entity26 said			1
but the pictures he saw of @entity69 taken after his injury told a different story			0
" he was ... half his size			0
it was so sad , " he said			0
" it dawned on me that people are facing this all over the @entity78 " @entity26 mobilized an army of carpenters , plumbers and suppliers who took on the remodeling job for free			1
they widened doorways , built a ramp to the back door and made the bathroom more accessible			2
" anything that needed to be done , @entity26 said , ' we 'll take care of it , ' " @entity53 recalled			1
" it was just a huge , huge relief			0
" when the work on @entity53 's home was complete , @entity26 realized he was just getting started			1
" it really broke my heart to think ( about ) these young men and women , " he said			0
he decided the best way he could help wounded veterans was by doing what he knew best : building them homes			1
" it was like someone hit me upside the head with a 2x4			0
... i just felt like this is what @entity108 wants me to do			0
" @entity26 took his idea to his local trade group , the @entity112 , and convinced members to start a homebuilding program for wounded veterans			1
with donations from suppliers and contractors , @entity26 said , the group can build a $ 250,000 house for about $ 75,000			1
each house is customized -- and often fully furnished -- to meet the needs of each family , and they are mortgage - free			1
the group also covers taxes and insurance for one year			0
wounded veterans or their spouses often have to find a new career or go back to school , making it hard to make ends meet , @entity26 said			1
" if you can alleviate a financial burden off these young kids where they can concentrate on rebuilding their lives , you can really make a difference , " he said			2
lt. @entity139 is one such story			0
as a @entity57 , he was injured by an ied in @entity15 in 2004 and ultimately had one of his legs amputated			1
returning to civilian life was hard , and his family rapidly burned through its savings			0
" we 'd saved money for rainy days , but ... it was raining , " @entity148 said			0
receiving a home from @entity152 in november 2008 turned their fortunes around			0
@entity148 started studying for his doctorate in public safety ; his wife earned her master 's degree and became a special education teacher			1
" it saved us , " he said			0
" we 're moving on and moving forward			0
... for someone to think about me and my family ... to build a home -- wow			0
" @entity26 is determined to help as many families as he can			1
his group has enlisted builders and builders ' associations in 17 states to join his crusade			0
the group has 42 homes under construction , with the goal of building 50 - 60 more next year			2
considering the industry was hard - hit by the recession , @entity26 says he 's been heartened by the response			1
now retired , @entity26 dedicates most of his time to this effort without pay			1
he says it 's the least he can do to repay some of the more than 50,000 troops who 've been wounded in @entity16 and @entity15			2
" these kids ... they 're doing it for me and you , " he said			0
" so we 're the ones that need to step up and do something			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity196 website and see how to help .			2

@entity26 's organization builds free homes for wounded war veterans
@entity26 , a 2010 @entity42 , started it after meeting the father of a wounded @entity57
