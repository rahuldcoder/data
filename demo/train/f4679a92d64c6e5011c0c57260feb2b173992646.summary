-- it is a bittersweet irony that , after a four - decade career which saw @entity4 train thousands of racehorses , he will forever be remembered for just one -- @entity7			1
it is now almost impossible to mention @entity4 , who passed away tuesday at the age of 70 after a long battle with cancer , without mentioning @entity7 in the same breath			1
yet the master trainer had already done more than enough to stake his claim to being one of the greatest trainers ever to grace the turf before the bay colt with the four white feet arrived at his @entity21 yard in 2010			0
@entity4 was born in 1943 into an aristocratic family			2
he used to claim , with typical self - deprecation , that he was the first person from his prep school to ever fail the @entity27 entrance exam			0
he obtained his training license in 1969 and rapidly began chalking up a string of notable successes			0
in 1973 he tasted his first classic success , with @entity32 in the @entity33			0
two years later he captured his first @entity34 with @entity35 in the @entity36 -- a race he later also won with @entity7			2
he won the first of his four @entity39 with @entity40 in 1985 , the year he also won the " @entity42 " with @entity41			0
but the 10 - time champion trainer experienced a dramatic fall from grace in the early years of the 21st century			1
his colorful personal life had taken him from stalwart of the racing pages to the front page of the @entity51 tabloid @entity50			2
at the same time , his relationship with @entity53 , one of his principle owners , broke down , resulting in the removal of 40 of the @entity58 ruler 's horses from @entity4 's care			1
the arrival of @entity7 into his yard in the twilight of his career marked a return to prominence after a period in the wilderness in which @entity4 later admitted he considered retirement			1
he became a " sir " after being knighted by @entity51 's @entity69 in 2011 for his services to racing			2
" he was one of the finest trainers of racehorses that the sport has ever witnessed , " @entity74 joint president @entity73 said			0
" his influence over generations of jockeys is renowned and those who rode for him benefited hugely from his knowledge and experience			0
he will be much missed by all of us			0
" @entity7 , the son of champion sire @entity85 , went on to win 14 races in an undefeated three - year career and is regarded by many as the greatest racehorse ever produced			1
@entity4 is widely credited with managing @entity7 's career with delicacy and intelligence , allowing the colt to fulfill his potential			1
in 2006 it had been revealed that @entity4 was undergoing treatment for stomach cancer			2
by 2012 , his condition appeared to have worsened and , blighted by ill - health , he missed a number of important races , including @entity7 's successful defense of the group 1 @entity104 at @entity105			2
but he was determined to be present at the @entity106 at @entity107 , which is where the iconic image of the trainer , braced against the elements in his trilby as he raged against the dying of the light , became imprinted on the racing public 's consciousness			0
as a stunned crowed watched @entity7 demolish his rivals on his first outing over a mile and a quarter , a frail and visibly withered @entity4 , never one for great displays of emotion , permitted himself a smile			1
asked how @entity7 's win had made him feel , barely audible , he whispered : " young again			0
" @entity7 was , of course , named after legendary @entity123 trainer @entity7 , who succumbed to his own battle with cancer in 2009			1
@entity7 is now enjoying a career a stud , with the first of his progeny due to set foot on the racetrack in 2016			0
it would a fitting tribute to the genius behind @entity7 's remarkable career if one of those sons or daughters were to bear the name @entity4 .			1
