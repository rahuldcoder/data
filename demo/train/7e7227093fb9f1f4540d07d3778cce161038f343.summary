-- @entity2 's high court ruled in favor of pop superstar @entity5 on friday , saying she will be able to adopt a young girl from the country , said @entity9 , a spokeswoman for the attorney general 's office			1
@entity5 walks with her @entity2 son , @entity11 , in @entity12 , @entity2 , in march			1
" in our judgment , " the court wrote in its ruling , " the welfare of infant @entity18 will be better taken care of by having her adopted by the foreign parent rather than for her to grow up in an orphanage where she will have no family life , no love and affection of parents			2
" @entity5 issued a statement saying she is " extremely grateful for the @entity28 's ruling on my application to adopt @entity30			1
... my family and i look forward to sharing our lives with her			2
" the young girl at the center of the current case is @entity37 , whose first name translates to " mercy " in @entity40 , @entity2 's national language			1
@entity5 , 50 , took her effort to adopt the three - year - old to @entity2 's highest court last month after a lower court ruled the adoption did not meet local law			1
@entity2 requires applicants for adoption to have lived in the country for 18 months before they may be granted permission			0
that condition was waived in 2006 , when @entity5 adopted another @entity2 child , @entity11			1
@entity5 has two other children who are not adopted			1
@entity55 has lived in an orphanage for most of her life ; her teenage mother died shortly after childbirth			0
meanwhile , child rights group eye of the child told @entity0 it agrees with friday 's high court ruling			2
the group had earlier opposed the adoption			0
" there was legal confusion about this case , " said @entity65 , executive director of @entity66			0
" we are happy that the high court is able now to give us direction			0
this provides an important precedent			0
" but the man believed to be the father of @entity37 told @entity79 's " @entity78 " that he did not want @entity5 to adopt the young girl			1
i need my baby , " @entity80 said			0
" i do n't know where i can find any help			0
" @entity80 told @entity79 that he wants to raise the child			0
" i do not want my baby to be adopted because i want to take care of her and i 'm capable to take care of my baby			2
... @entity55 , she is a @entity2 -- so ( i ) need her to grow as a @entity2 , as well with our culture			0
" the court said it does not know who the girl 's father is			2
@entity5 's long - term charitable involvement in the country was considered when the court decided in her favor , according to the judgment			1
@entity5 has been involved with @entity2 for several years and made a documentary , " @entity100 , " to highlight the poverty , @entity102 and other diseases devastating children in the country			1
she also co-founded a nonprofit group , raising @entity2 , that provides programs to help the needy			0
