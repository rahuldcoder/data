@entity1 's decision to drop out of the @entity3 presidential race came after he spent the holiday weekend evaluating the race with his family , who were grappling with the latest hospitalization of his 3 - year - old daughter @entity7			1
@entity1 's path to the nomination hinged on three puzzle pieces falling neatly in place , multiple sources close to the campaign told @entity14 , a prospect that grew dimmer with each passing day			1
the campaign , eagerly looking ahead to a slew of conservative leaning states that vote in may , had hoped that @entity19 would adjust its proportional primary rules and award its treasure trove of 155 delegates on a winner - take - all basis -- but @entity19 @entity3 dismissed the idea			1
@entity1 was also hoping that @entity26 , who has also been competing for the same conservative anti-romney voters , would drop out of the race , something the former house speaker shows no signs of doing			1
finally , the campaign understood that a victory in @entity1 's home state of @entity35 on april 24 was crucial			1
@entity37 's poll numbers have lately creeped up in @entity35 and his campaign was in the process of unleashing a more than $ 2 million negative ad blitz against @entity1 across the state , but @entity1 aides said they remained confident that they would pull out a win on their home turf			1
his campaign reported it was nearly $ 1 million in debt last month and would have been forced to drain its campaign account to compete with @entity37 and his allies on the costly @entity35 airwaves , another factor in @entity1 's decision			1
where do religious conservatives go ? " the @entity37 team was putting a lot of money out there , " said one @entity1 adviser who did not want to be named discussing internal decision - making			1
" the budget was a factor			0
" despite trailing in the delegate count , @entity1 vowed as recently as last week to remain in the race until one candidate reached the 1,144 delegates needed to capture the nomination			2
however , during a conference call with his wife , @entity68 , campaign manager and staff before his announcement on tuesday , @entity1 said the decision was based on personal and political factors , according to a @entity1 source			1
a campaign adviser also said the financial state of the campaign probably played a role in the conclusion			1
" we made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race for us is over for me and we will suspend our campaign effective today , we are not done fighting , " @entity1 said during his speech in @entity81 on tuesday			1
" we will continue to fight for those voices for those @entity87 who stood up and gave us that air under our wings			0
" he also acknowledged the decision was not entirely political , saying the past weekend was a " time of prayer and thought " as he and his family cared for his daughter @entity93 , the youngest of @entity1 's seven children , who suffers from @entity95 , a chromosomal condition			1
@entity1 's organization announced they were halting campaign events on friday because the candidate 's three - year - old daughter @entity7 was admitted to the hospital			1
@entity7 , the youngest of @entity1 's seven children , suffers from a rare chromosomal disorder called @entity104 18 , which causes severe medical and developmental problems			1
@entity1 's departure leaves rival @entity37 with a firm grasp on the nomination but also deep wounds left to heal within the @entity3			1
priebus : " @entity111 heals some wounds " @entity1 spoke to @entity37 before tuesday 's speech , according to a @entity3 source			2
but @entity1 aide @entity115 told @entity14 an endorsement of the former @entity119 governor " is not a inevitability			2
" @entity115 said @entity1 and @entity37 are attempting to schedule a meeting to discuss an endorsement and that the latter would like it to occur " sooner rather than later			2
" @entity1 entered the race with a voting record in the @entity126 and @entity127 of a staunch social conservative and presented himself on the campaign trail as the alternative to more moderate candidates , who he said had compromised their ideals for political expediency			1
more recently , he elevated his fire directly at @entity37 , labeling him a flip - flopper on conservative issues including abortion rights , cap and trade and government mandated health care			2
he also repeatedly accused the former executive of failing to tell the truth			0
" for somebody who is maybe the weakest candidate we 've every had on the pro-life issue to attack the leader of the pro-life cause is absurd , " @entity1 said at a forum in @entity145 , @entity146 on february 25			0
" he glosses over and does n't even tell the truth ...			0
here is a guy who is the ultimate flip - flopper running for president , and he 's attacking me for not being principled ? that does n't wash			0
" @entity1 officially announced his candidacy on june 6 , 2011 , and quickly began airing radio ads in @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , the first three states to vote			0
soon after his official announcement , he told @entity14 that his bid would be based on a consistent conservative record			0
" i think i stand out because i have been a consistent conservative , someone who has been a leader , someone who 's had the courage to lead on a variety of hot - button topics before they were popular , like entitlement reform			0
i 've been a leader on that , " he said			0
in august , when his candidacy was barely making waves in key early voting states , @entity1 maintained his effort would take a long view of the race , saying at a rally , " this is the little - engine - that - could campaign			1
" he was eclipsed first by @entity183 's entry in the race , then @entity185 's			0
when those two faltered , @entity186 became the conservative favorite			0
as @entity186 was faltering amid accusations of sexual harrassment , @entity188 was the last conservative to slingshot past @entity1 , taking a lead over @entity37 in polls in november and december			0
at @entity3 presidential debates throughout the fall , @entity1 was mostly marginalized as the most questions went to the top - tier candidates			2
in the months leading up to @entity161 's caucuses , @entity1 became the first @entity3 presidential candidate to visit all of @entity161 's 99 counties , often sporting what became his signature look ( and the butt of jokes ) : a sweater vest bearing his campaign 's logo			1
despite all that time in @entity161 , @entity1 did n't see substantial traction in polls until january as @entity26 withered in the heat of negative ads from @entity37 's campaign and a super pac that supports him			1
and on election night in @entity161 , it looked like @entity1 had narrowly missed his first surprise victory in the race when initial counts showed he had come eight votes short of beating @entity37			2
the narrow miss was enough to energize conservatives to contribute to the cause and give @entity1 a spike in fundraising			0
and his conservative rivals began to fall			0
@entity183 dropped out of the race the day after @entity161			0
two weeks later , the certified vote in @entity161 showed that @entity1 had actually won there and @entity185 dropped out of the race later that same day			2
@entity26 then won in @entity163 and @entity37 won in @entity229 and @entity230 , states that @entity1 largely ignored to concentrate on more conservative voters down the road			1
that strategy paid off when he stunned @entity37 by sweeping @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 all on the same day and changed the trajectory of the race			0
@entity37 , who had begun to take on the air of the @entity3 nominee by focusing on president @entity241 rather than @entity3 rivals , had to turn his focus back toward his challenger and built up a nearly 400 - delegate lead in the race to the 1,144 needed to clinch the nomination			0
@entity248 : the real race is now on despite increasingly long odds , @entity1 maintained throughout the last weeks of march that he would stay in the race , citing flawed delegate math and upcoming contests that looked to be in his favor			2
" our delegate calculation has gov. @entity37 far below 50 % , " @entity1 said on march 19 on @entity255			0
" we think there 's a lot of primaries coming up , including @entity35 my home state , where we can make some big delegates			0
@entity19 will be another great state for us			2
we feel very good that we 're going to continue to win and do well			0
" a senior @entity1 source said that @entity7 's hospitalization was a major factor in the decision to bow out			1
" when you have enough time with your adrenaline down , you start to think about what 's really important , " the source told @entity14			0
sitting in the hospital with his daughter for the second time during this campaign put that in perspective for @entity1 , the source said .			2

@entity1 made his decision after evaluating the race with his family
campaign hoped that @entity19 would become a winner - take - all state
@entity1 also wanted @entity26 out of race , but he shows no sign of quitting
financial issues also played a role in @entity1 's decision
