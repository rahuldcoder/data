-- airport security is a traveler 's rite of passage : the long lines , the @entity6 check , the shuffling of personal items			1
get through security faster with these easy strategies			0
to move through security quickly , wear slip - on shoes , minimal jewelry and no belt			1
pack like you 're making lasagna ( no , seriously ! ) you probably do n't want a security official inspecting your carry - on bag by hand			1
time - consuming inspections usually only happen when an x-ray machine operator ca n't identify items			1
avoid this hassle by packing in a way that keeps your curling iron , hair dryer , and other hard - plastic or dense items separate in your bag , instead of allowing them to get tangled in a pile -- and look suspiciously like a bomb or a weapon on an x-ray scan			2
layer your electronics and toiletries in between your clothes like you 're spreading ricotta cheese in between strips of pasta to prepare lasagna			1
put heavy clothes on top to act as a weight and secure loose items			2
remember the 3 - 1 - 1 rule if you plan to go carry - on only , any liquid should be kept in a 3.4 - ounce bottle or smaller			2
you 're only allowed as many bottles as can fit in one quart - size , clear ziplock bag			1
find bottles in your local drugstore 's travel or $ 1 section , or online			2
buying products packaged in small amounts can be expensive : we recently found face wash in a two - ounce bottle for for $ 9 , shaving cream for about $ 6 , and contact lens solution for $ 10.50			2
by transferring your liquids from standard - size bottles into @entity67 - friendly containers , like these squishy bottles from @entity69 , you should save a lot of money			1
dress for success slip - on shoes ( preferably with socks ; think of the dirty feet that have been on that linoleum ) , minimal jewelry and no belt is the standard uniform for moving through security fast			1
if you insist on wearing jewelry and a watch on the plane , take them off and slip them into a pocket in your carry - on before you enter the security cordon			2
use flight - ready toiletries keep your travel bag stocked with " flight ready " items that do n't break the @entity67 's liquid rules , such as solid perfume , and lip balm instead of lip gloss			1
buy a @entity67 - approved laptop bag the @entity67 allows laptops to go through the x-ray in checkpoint - friendly laptop bags , like a simple $ 20 @entity101			1
the most common and cheapest is a laptop sleeve			0
@entity103 recommends a few here			0
laptops are also among the most - forgotten items at security , so label yours with a business card or id tag			0
keep an eye peeled for new security programs fifty airports ( including @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 ) have security lines split among @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity119 travelers			0
look for the signs and hit the line that 's right for you -- we suggest expert now that you 've read our tips			0
also , remember that 18 airports and five airlines are currently participating in the @entity128 pilot program			0
if the program covers your flight , you can go straight to the security checkpoint and use your cell phone as a boarding pass			0
read about it on our blog			0
it 's showtime once you 've presented your @entity6 and boarding pass , get moving			0
find the shortest line -- look especially for lines toward your left because studies show that @entity143 are more likely to turn right than left when entering a building , so lines on the left will tend to be shorter			1
the @entity67 is asking travelers to put shoes directly on the x-ray belt , so do that first			1
pull out your quart - size bag of liquids and small electronics ( like an @entity154 ) and lay them on top of your jacket			1
in the second bin , put your laptop ( or , if you 've got just got one bag or purse , use this bin for that )			0
after successfully passing through the metal detector ( because we know you will ) , grab your shoes and slip them on , then snag your other belongings and slip them back in your bag			0
look around quickly for anything that may have come loose , and then exit the security area to keep the line moving			0
