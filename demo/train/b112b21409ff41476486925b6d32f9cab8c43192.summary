@entity0 -- it 's a subject seldom addressed publicly in the @entity4 territories , but for the first time , a report is lifting the veil on the taboo topic of female trafficking and forced prostitution -- and calling for action to stop it			1
trafficking and forced prostitution in @entity0 , the @entity13 and @entity14 operate on a small - scale basis , rather than being part of a sophisticated and organized activity , the report found			1
but the two practices are also frequent and widespread -- and the women and girls involved have few means of escape			1
the 26 - page report , released wednesday and titled " trafficking and forced prostitution of @entity4 women and girls : forms of @entity32 , " was researched and written by @entity28 , a nonprofit @entity4 group that combats violence against women			1
@entity28 received support for the report from @entity35 , the @entity35 , which is making the report available online			0
getting information for the report -- which was completed in june 2008 but published only now -- was difficult because of the stigma suffered by the victims and the sensitivity of the subject within @entity4 society , @entity28 said			2
explaining the delay between completing the research and publishing the report , @entity35 spokesman @entity45 said it took a long time to analyze the data from the field , and staff in @entity14 were also forced in january of this year to turn their attention to victims of the fighting in @entity14 between @entity57 and @entity58			1
" dating [ the report ] 2009 would have been misleading , because the data was collected in 2008 , " he said			0
" it was hard for us to publish it , and it took us a long time to decide how , whom and why , because of the situation and the sensitivity of the subject , " @entity28 representative @entity67 added			0
the report found that unemployment and poverty play a major role in pushing girls and women into prostitution and making them vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers			1
most of the women have also been " violently abused by their families , especially their fathers , " the report found			2
the trafficked women who spoke to researchers said they had been " battered continuously " at home , then forced into marriage , often facing further violence at the hands of their husbands			2
the situation is no better if the trafficked women and girls are accompanied by pimps or madams , who threaten the girls with violence if they refuse sex with clients			2
in one case , a trafficker called " @entity103 " threatened to inform a girl 's family if she tried to escape and to disseminate embarrassing pictures of her engaged in sexual activity			2
researchers found no studies or reports on the issue , just local newspaper reports on specific cases , @entity28 said			0
they did manage to conduct 11 face - to - face interviews with " informants , " or @entity4 willing to speak out about the problem			2
those included police officers , victims ' lawyers , taxi drivers and hotel owners			0
field researchers also managed to conduct in - person interviews with three trafficked women and included their case studies in the report			0
@entity28 said its groundbreaking report is not meant as a comprehensive study , but rather an initial step in identifying the problem			1
" for the first time , people have chosen to break the silence and speak out , and this briefing paper can be seen as a first step to start answering the need for protecting women and girl victims of trafficking and forced prostitution in the [ occupied @entity4 territories ] , " the report says			1
if the victimized women somehow escape their situations , they face further problems on several fronts			2
the report found there are few social networks or shelter houses to which they can turn , that they may be ostracized by their communities and families , and that the law may treat them as criminals			1
the first case study in the report is of a 23 - year - old married mother of three from @entity0			1
a @entity4 , she says her father used to abuse her violently on a daily basis , tightening a belt around her neck until she fainted , then forcing her to live in the basement for days without food			0
after the woman 's father forced her into marriage at 16 , her husband raped her on their wedding night , then continued to beat her , she said			0
she ran away from home and met two men who promised her shelter and employment in @entity57 -- but instead , when she got there , she was kept in a house and forced to be a prostitute , she said			0
when she once refused to sleep with a client , the woman said her pimp called her father , who took her home and hit her violently until she fainted			0
she now lives at a safe house , the report said			0
in another case , a field researcher overheard two women talking in the front seat of a public taxi on the way from @entity0 to the @entity13 city of @entity194			1
the woman told her friend she was unable to obtain a birth certificate for a baby fathered by one of her former clients at a brothel			0
the woman said she was forced to leave the brothel after becoming pregnant and now did n't know what to do : " i went to the social services in @entity0 , but they could not help me either , " she was overheard as saying			1
a lack of willingness by law enforcement to investigate these cases and prosecute the traffickers -- along with criminalizing the victims ' behavior -- only compounds the problem , the report said			2
the @entity4 territories use a hodgepodge of laws applicable to different areas , which also makes it difficult to take action , the report said			0
the report calls on @entity4 governmental organizations to draft new legislation guaranteeing that girls and women are treated as victims of crime and not as offenders , and referring to forced prostitution as sexual violence			1
it also urges civil groups to document cases of forced prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes and to push the government to change the law			1
the @entity35 defines human trafficking as the recruitment , transportation , harboring or receipt of people by force , coercion , fraud or abuse of power			0
traffickers seek to exploit their victims for sexual purposes , forced labor or removal of organs , @entity28 said .			0
