-- the politically divided @entity4 territories took a major step toward reconciliation wednesday when the rival movements of @entity8 and @entity9 announced a deal to form a unity government , officials from both groups said			1
the move comes amid international efforts for statehood advanced by @entity16 president @entity15 of @entity9			2
it could portend unity in the fractious @entity4 territories			1
the two political factions have been close to civil war , culminating in 2007 when @entity8 took control of @entity23 after deadly fighting with @entity9 partisans			1
@entity9 retained control of the other @entity4 territory , the @entity27			1
one expert described the announcement as a significant development -- occurring against the larger backdrop of uprisings throughout the @entity34 world			1
the threat of similar unrest in the @entity4 territories may have spurred the two factions to seek a deal , said @entity40 , a history professor at the @entity41 at @entity42 and a @entity44 expert			1
" if it goes through , it 's a very big deal , " @entity40 said of the agreement			1
" from 1964 to 2007 , the @entity4 national movement spoke with one voice			2
beginning in 2007 , the @entity4 national movement spoke with two voices			2
so if the @entity4 are going to attempt to move toward statehood , they 're going to have to speak with one voice again			2
" @entity40 added that both factions fear " that whatever is going on in the rest of the @entity34 world is going on in @entity56 but underneath the surface			1
" on march 15 , @entity4 demonstrators filled @entity59 in @entity60 , but their demands were for an end to the split between @entity8 and @entity9 rather than the revolutionary themes in other @entity34 countries			1
instead of occupying the square like the @entity68 protesters in neighboring @entity69 , the @entity4 called for change through unification and then dispersed , though lingering elements remain as part of what they proclaim as the march 15 movement			2
" there is a concern that they are becoming increasingly irrelevant , both @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity9 was a child of the ' 50s with their armed struggle and tactics and their level of corruption			0
@entity8 was a child of the 1980s with the so - called @entity86 wave , " @entity40 said			1
another expert , however , said any formal involvement of @entity8 in a new government would doom its diplomatic relations with the @entity91 because it has deemed @entity8 a terrorist organization			2
" it 's essentially a great blow for @entity91 policy , " said @entity93 , a professor of political science and international affairs at @entity96			0
" if they can come up with a neutral government " in which @entity8 is n't formally involved with any ministries , @entity93 said , " they might be able to get around the legal requirements but the political obstacles will be there			0
" a lot depends on the fine print , " @entity93 added			0
@entity109 , the head of @entity9 's negotiating team , formally announced the deal in @entity68			1
" today , we signed a memorandum of understanding outlining points that we agree on regarding what the @entity69 proposal suggested , " @entity109 said			0
" we also added our agreement to form a government made up of independent figures			0
" we agreed on a date for elections and talked about national participation and cooperation in the post-elections period , " he added			0
@entity126 prime minister @entity125 warned that the authority must decide whether it wants " peace with @entity126 or peace with @entity8			1
" " it is impossible to have peace with both since @entity8 is looking to destroy the state of @entity126 and says it openly , " he said , emphasizing that projectiles have been fired on cities and children			1
" i think that the mere idea of reconciliation shows the weakness of the @entity16 and raises wonders whether @entity8 will take over @entity140 and @entity141 as it took over the @entity23			0
i hope that the @entity16 chooses right -- that it chooses peace with @entity126			2
the choice is theirs , " @entity125 said			0
many @entity126 refer to the @entity27 as @entity140 and @entity141			0
on wednesday , @entity91 officials continued to express concerns about @entity8			0
" we have seen the press reports and are seeking more information , " said @entity146 , @entity147 spokesman			0
" as we have said before , the @entity91 supports @entity4 reconciliation on terms which promote the cause of peace , " @entity146 said			2
" @entity8 , however , is a terrorist organization which targets civilians			0
to play a constructive role in achieving peace , any @entity4 government must accept the quartet principles and renounce violence , abide by past agreements and recognize @entity126 's right to exist			1
" the @entity162 -- the @entity91 , the @entity163 , @entity164 and the @entity165 -- has called on the new government to renounce terror and recognize @entity126			0
the deal would establish a new parliament and a date for general elections , @entity8 officials said wednesday			2
they 've also reached an agreement over security issues that have kept the two sides apart , the @entity8 officials said			0
@entity9 officials said @entity8 ' reservations have been discussed and resolved and also confirmed that the two parties have agreed to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in a year 's time			1
@entity9 leader @entity15 and @entity8 leader @entity182 are going to meet soon in @entity69 , a @entity8 official said			1
for years , there has been a big divide between the hard - line and anti-israel @entity8 and @entity9 , which has engaged in peace negotiations with @entity126			1
in the recent past , both sides sought reconciliation , but those efforts failed			0
@entity126 and militants in @entity23 have fought continually for years			0
@entity126 has retaliated against @entity23 militants who have fired missiles into southern @entity126 towns			0
@entity0 's @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .			0

new : a @entity4 protest last month sought @entity9 - @entity8 unity
an expert says the announcement marks " a very big deal "
but the two factions may be acting out of fear that the @entity34 world 's uprisings could hit them , too
@entity126 says @entity9 must pick peace with @entity8 or with @entity126
