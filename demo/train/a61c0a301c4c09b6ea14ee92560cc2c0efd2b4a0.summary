editor 's note : @entity2 is president of the @entity3 , a nonprofit organization that advocates for policies to help children escape poverty , abuse and neglect and gain access to health care and education			1
@entity2 was the first black woman admitted to the @entity14 bar and was a leader in the civil rights movement			1
her latest book is " @entity18 : charting a course for the @entity20			0
" @entity2 says many black babies enter the world with multiple strikes against them			1
( @entity24 ) -- one of the most dangerous threats facing black @entity26 right now is quietly stealing our children at a young age			1
@entity30 is becoming the new @entity26 apartheid , and poor children of color are the fodder			2
so many poor black babies in rich @entity26 enter the world with multiple strikes against them : born without prenatal care , at low birthweight and to a poor , and poorly educated , teenage single mother and an absent father			2
at crucial points in their development after birth through adolescence , more risks pile on , making a successful transition to productive adulthood significantly less likely and involvement in the criminal justice system significantly more likely			2
this is @entity26 's pipeline to prison , a trajectory that is funneling tens of thousands of youths down life paths that lead to marginalized lives , imprisonment and , often , premature death			1
nationally , one in three black boys and one in 17 black girls born in 2001 is at risk of imprisonment during their lifetime			1
it 's time to sound a loud alarm about this threat to @entity26 unity and community , act to stop the growing criminalization of children at younger and younger ages , and tackle the unjust treatment of minority youths and adults in the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems with urgency and persistence			1
we must reduce detention and incarceration by increasing preventive supports and services children need , including access to comprehensive child health and mental health coverage , quality early childhood development programs like @entity90 , and supports for parents including home visitation programs			2
and every child has to get an education that prepares him or her to succeed in the 21st - century economy			0
the failure to act now will reverse the hard - earned racial and social progress for which the rev. @entity100 and so many others died and sacrificed			0
the urgent challenge for each of us and for our nation is to prevent this waste of our children 's lives and our nation 's future capabilities			0
who are some of the black leaders coming up with solutions for saving our children ? people like @entity118 , president and ceo of the @entity120 , who recently spoke about his work to @entity24 's @entity122 for the " @entity124 " series			1
the @entity125 is a holistic system of education , social service and community - building programs designed to help the children and families in a 97 - block area of @entity133 from birth on , from classes on baby care and child development through preschool , intensive public charter schools and after - school activities right up to job training and college success programs			1
the @entity144 's two fundamental goals are to help children as early in their lives as possible and to create a critical mass of adults around them who understand what it takes to help them succeed			0
the evidence -- including new research on the success of @entity120 's @entity156 charter schools in closing black - white student test score achievement gaps -- shows that @entity120 's comprehensive approach to saving @entity133 's children is working			1
i applaud the @entity163 administration 's plans to create 20 additional " promise zones " across the country			0
@entity166 is another visionary leader working on solutions to the pipeline to prison crisis in @entity170 and @entity171			2
she is co-director of the @entity172 , a policy , communications and legal " action tank " committed to racial justice			0
@entity177 is known for her unconventional approaches to tackling problems of inequity and exclusion , and she works on education , gang and violence prevention , and other serious concerns affecting the healthy development of young people			0
during her long career as a civil rights lawyer , including serving as co-director of the @entity170 office of the @entity192 , she won billions of dollars in policy changes and remedies , including a 1999 lawsuit that gained $ 750 million for school construction in @entity170 that had been set to go to suburban school districts			0
@entity177 and her colleagues are finding innovative ways of dismantling some of the persistent structural inequalities that exist in @entity26 , and their successes help level the playing field for poor children of color			0
we need to celebrate , support and replicate the work of these kinds of leaders			0
child poverty and neglect , racial disparities in systems that serve children , and the pipeline to prison are not acts of @entity217			1
they are our nation 's immoral political and economic choices that can and must be changed with strong political , corporate , community and family leadership			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : black youths at *higher* risk of going to prison
she says innovators like @entity120 are showing strong results
@entity2 : investing in children from birth can break the pipeline to prison
