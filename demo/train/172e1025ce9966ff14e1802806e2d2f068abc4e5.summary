@entity0 -- in a country that restricts gambling as much as @entity4 , it 's become a running cultural joke that soccer betting is an endemic multi-billion yuan business			1
a cheeky group of contemporary artists -- the @entity8 -- has almost made an industry from lampooning the @entity4 love of illegal soccer gambling			1
with artworks like " @entity14 -- fiercer than a @entity24 , " a title swiped from a local newspaper headline , or pamphlets that at first glance look like taoist temple augurs that are really thinly disguised soccer predictions , the artists ' work attempts to show how much illegal betting is now part of @entity4 cultural life			2
the advent of the internet coupled with millions of illegal @entity4 gamblers coming on stream has seriously skewed the market in soccer gambling			1
@entity34 's revelations that hundreds of matches have been fixed may have hit the industry in @entity37 , but will come as no surprise in soccer betting - crazy @entity4			1
@entity44 , in his 2008 book on match - fixing , @entity43 , quoted " a recent study for the @entity47 journal @entity48 [ that ] estimated the entire @entity51 gambling industry , both legal and illegal , at $ 450 billion a year			1
" analysts say sums like these are equal to 20 times the revenues of all of @entity37 professional football leagues put together -- a situation that has made match - fixing a global and , some argue , mature and stable industry			1
@entity63 police researching corruption in professional football in 2009 identified groups dubbed " belchinezen " or " phone @entity4 " -- groups of people of @entity51 descent standing in near - empty stadiums of even youth league matches phoning in results for gambling companies in @entity4 or @entity75			2
@entity63 police said though they had no laws to act against illicit betting couriers			0
on monday though @entity34 dropped the bombshell that its five - country probe identified 680 suspicious matches , putting the integrity of football at stake			1
" it is clear to us that this is the biggest investigation ever into suspected match fixing , " @entity34 chief @entity86 told a news conference in @entity88 , adding that the fall - out hit at the heart of the world game 's reputation			2
" it is the work of a sophisticated organized crime syndicate based in @entity75 and working with criminal facilitators around @entity37 , " said @entity86			0
he added : " @entity101 is a significant threat to football ... involving a broad community of actors			0
illegal profits are being made that threatens the very fabric of the game " @entity44 has identified @entity110 as the center of @entity51 illegal soccer betting			1
he told @entity1 that while convictions in @entity37 were encouraging , the key was in getting @entity51 police to make arrests as well			0
" if you really want to wrap this up , you 've got to go to @entity110 , " @entity44 said			0
@entity119 , a senior writer at @entity120 , told @entity1 there were many methods for fixing and throwing even major league soccer matches			2
" there 's different ways of doing it , " @entity119 said			0
" one way is to convince players to go out on the field and do things to impact the game -- whether that 's saving goals , or whether that 's doing things that alter the final result			0
" but there are other ways to do that too			0
if you are presenting yourself as a promoter and you 're trying to fix a game you can set up an international friendly by paying the national federations and you can put the referee out there and then the ref is someone that can be controlled and can call a penalty or not at a certain point in the game			0
