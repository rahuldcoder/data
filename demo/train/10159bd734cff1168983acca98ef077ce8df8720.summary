-- commercial air travel is already filled with annoyances like shrinking personal space , overpriced meals and frequent delays			0
for many people , there 's one bright spot to flying : a forced break from making , receiving and hearing phone calls			1
that could change with the @entity13 new proposal to drop the ban on cellular connections and allow phone calls once a plane reaches 10,000 feet			1
the @entity13 first pitched the idea in 2004 , before the rise of the smartphone			1
the reaction from passengers and flight attendant unions at the time was loud and negative : phone calls on planes would be disruptive , annoying and a potential safety issue			1
the @entity13 decided against the proposal			1
now people are more attached to their tablets and smartphones			0
so much so that they rebelled against the ban on using small electronic devices such as phones , tablets and e-readers during takeoff and landing			2
after reviewing safety issues , the @entity39 and airlines finally gave in this month and relaxed restrictions			2
an unpopular idea quietly playing games or reading e-books on a tablet or phone is one thing , but chatting away mid-flight does n't seem to be as in demand			1
in a survey of 1,600 adults by an advisory group , the @entity39 found that 61 % of people supported a ban on making calls while in the air			1
" i 'm definitely against it , " said @entity58 , travel editor at the @entity59			0
" people would be carrying on loud , full - voiced conversations right next to someone who does n't want to hear it			0
" the @entity65 , the world 's largest union of flight attendants , came out against the idea on thursday , citing safety and security concerns			1
" in far too many operational scenarios , passengers making phone calls could extend beyond a mere nuisance , creating negative effects on aviation safety and security that are great and far too risky , " the @entity65 said in a statement			1
@entity79 , who blogs about the airline industry on @entity81 , agrees with lifting the restriction and thinks each airline should be allowed to set its own policy			2
" the public in the @entity86 seems to be strongly against cell phones on airplanes , but let the airlines make the decision on whether or not they want to move forward and allow it , " said @entity79			1
keeping the peace cell phones could cause friction between passengers who want to talk and passengers who would prefer peace and quiet			1
they would introduce yet another behavior flight attendants would have to police			1
" we 're trained to de-escalate			0
why would you put something in the environment that can escalate ? " said @entity102 , the international president of the @entity65			0
@entity102 has worked as a flight attendant for the past 22 years			2
" the idea potentially introduces yet another stress factor into an already stressful environment , " said airline pilot @entity107 of @entity108			2
the stress is made worse by tight quarters			0
when taking a phone call in public , it 's good etiquette to keep 10 feet away from other people , protocol expert @entity114 told @entity121			2
it 's not even possible to get 10 inches of space on an airplane , where economy class seats are typically 17 to 18 inches wide and each seat is butted up against the one next to it			0
one option is for the @entity13 and airlines to allow cell phone use and hope that passengers act responsibly and only make calls when necessary and speak in a quiet voice			1
unfortunately , the firsthand experience of flight attendants , frequently fliers and people who take other forms of mass transit cast doubt on that dream scenario			1
" the real problem with travel , especially air travel , is not baggage fees , it 's not long lines ... the real problem with travel is other travelers , " said @entity58			0
the " quiet car " option this is not the first time the issue has come up			2
terrestrial mass transit systems , including subways , buses and trains , have already struggled with the invasion of cell phones and loud talkers			2
some trains have addressed the problem of disruptive passengers on cellphones by adding quiet cars during certain hours			1
the @entity167 has separate cars during rush hour where noise , loud chatting , and phone calls are prohibited			1
some @entity174 trains also offer quiet cars , which forbid phone calls and any noise technology , and feature dimmed , soothing lighting			1
greyhound bus lines does n't have an official policy , but individual bus drivers have been known to crack down on loud talkers			0
unfortunately , quiet sections are n't a practical solution for airplanes ( though they would add yet another " premium " seating feature for which airlines could charge extra )			2
" on an airplane , there 's no such thing as a quiet car , " said @entity102			0
" in my opinion it 's not that different from having a smoking section on a 747 , it 's absurd			0
" smoking sections , which separated smokers and nonsmokers with a row of seats , were banned in the @entity86 along with smoking on airplanes in 1988			0
before 1973 , smokers could light up in any seat they liked			0
" theoretically , you could have a talking section and a nontalking section , but you 'd have to put up some serious plexiglass , " said @entity58			0
discount @entity210 airline @entity209 introduced a quiet zone in early 2013			0
sandwiched between first class and economy , the zone is an adult - only section intended to give travelers a respite from screeching children			0
like smoke from cigarettes and the sound of a crying baby , a loud phone conversation would likely ignore any invisible barriers and carry through an entire plane			1
call waiting the @entity13 will present its proposal in december , but even if it passes , it will be a while before in - flight cell phone calls are a reality			1
cell phone towers are on the ground and airplanes will need special equipment before passengers can dial out			1
" as it stands , cellular phones simply will not work at higher altitudes in an airplane cabin			0
changing this will require investment in on - board technology , " said @entity107			0
individual airlines will have to decide if allowing calls is something they want to allow			0
a more business - oriented airline might jump at the opportunity to lure working travelers			0
others might side with the majority of passengers and flight attendants and stick with a policy of " silence is golden			1
" " there 's so much hustle and bustle out there already , " said @entity102			0
" can people just have some peace and quiet for a few hours ? it 's not that retro of an idea			2

the @entity13 is proposing lifting the ban on cell phone calls on airplanes during flights
flight attendants and many passengers are against the idea for noise and safety reasons
creating a quiet area is one possible way to *appease* both sides , but sound will still carry
