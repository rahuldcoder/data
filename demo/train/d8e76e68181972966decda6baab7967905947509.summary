@entity0 says he 's not a diplomat , just a former @entity3 star fighting addiction and trying to be a better father			1
but that has n't kept him from becoming embroiled , even if unintentionally , in @entity9 - @entity8 relations			1
his apparent chumminess with @entity8 's leader has been controversial , as have previous proclamations that @entity13 is a " nice guy			2

" i keep telling people , i 'm not there to be an ambassador to try to figure out why ( is @entity13 ) doing all these things ? that 's not my job , " @entity0 told @entity22 's @entity21 on " @entity23 " friday			1
it was his first interview since entering an alcohol rehabilitation facility two weeks ago			2

" i feel for ( @entity33 's family )			1
i feel for them deeply			0
... i would do anything literally			0
if they ( @entity8 ) said , ' we 'll take @entity0 and we 'll let @entity52 go , ' i 'll say , ' you know what ? i 'll do that			1
' " ' i drink ... because i 'm bored ' the @entity8 topic was important , but friday 's interview was as much about @entity0 's personal struggles with addiction			1
" i 've always been a party animal , " @entity0 said			2
but he said this is a great time for him to reflect publicly and put himself at peace with a " lot of stuff that has been going on " over the past 18 months			0
" i think for me , the reason i drink is because i 'm bored , " he said			0
" am i an alcoholic ? absolutely , " @entity0 said			0

this month , the colorful basketball @entity74 , who won five @entity3 titles with the @entity77 and @entity78 , organized a team of former professional basketball stars to go to @entity8 for a game that was played on @entity13 's birthday			1
the players were criticized for traveling to the secretive state , a nation accused of human rights abuses			0
@entity8 also has pursued a nuclear program , despite warnings from the @entity9 and other @entity90 powers			1
@entity0 said his actions in @entity8 do not make him a bad person			1
" i 'm not a traitor , " @entity0 said			0
" my whole goal is to make people happy			0
" during the live interview , the former professional basketball player extended an invitation to take @entity21 to @entity8 to meet its leader , and decide for himself what kind of person @entity13 is			1
fellow player @entity101 defended the visit as a mission of basketball diplomacy , where sportsmen would share cultural ideas with each other			0
while there -- in what was his fourth trip to @entity8 -- @entity0 spoke to @entity21 in an at - times heated interview			1
the sunglasses - wearing @entity0 began yelling at the @entity22 anchor as he defended the team 's visit			1
" you know , you 've got 10 guys here , 10 guys here , that have left their families , they 've left their damn families , to help this country in a sports venture			0
that 's 10 guys , all these guys here , do anyone understand that ? " " we do , " responded @entity21			2
" and we appreciate that and we wish them well with cultural exchange			0
" " no , no , no , no , " @entity0 continued			0
" i do n't give a rat 's ass what the hell you think			0
i 'm saying to you , look at these guys here , look at them ... they dared to do one thing , they came here			0
" and @entity0 also implied that @entity33 , held prisoner for 15 months by the regime , was guilty of a crime , but he did not specify what offense			2
" do you understand what he did in this country ? " @entity0 asked @entity21 , who tried to interject			2
" no , no , no , you tell me , you tell me			0
why is he held captive here in this country , why ? " " i would love to speak on this , " @entity0 said , before abruptly switching topic to talk about how his fellow basketball players had left their families behind to come to @entity8 for the exhibition game			1
