@entity0 has emerged as one of the fastest - growing sources of international buyers for @entity5 real estate -- in what some see as a sign that @entity0 's rich are increasingly seeking to take their money out of the country			1
according to a report published by the @entity14 this week , buyers from @entity0 and @entity12 made up the second - largest group of foreign buyers of homes in the @entity5 in the 12 months to march -- @entity18 took first place -- accounting for $ 9bn of sales			1
that is a 23 per cent increase on the $ 7.3bn of sales they notched up in the previous 12 months and an 88 per cent increase from $ 4.8bn of sales in 2010			0
" international @entity0 buyers are seen as a very desirable market by real estate agents at the moment , " said @entity26 , managing director at the @entity14			1
" the strongest growth is coming from @entity0 and the rise of @entity0 buyers has made up for declines in sales from buyers from the @entity37 and @entity38			1
" sales to international @entity0 buyers still represent only a tiny fraction of the overall @entity5 market , which recorded $ 928.2bn in sales in the year to march			1
but at the top end of the market , it 's a different story			0
the 23 per cent jump in sales value , despite flat sales volume , suggests that @entity0 buyers have been active at the top end			1
@entity48 , chief executive of @entity49 , a residential real estate brokerage company , says there has been a " huge " influx of wealthy mainland @entity0 shopping for high - end properties in @entity54 since the start of the year			1
" it 's extraordinary , " she says			0
" five years ago , we never talked about @entity0 buyers			1
we started noticing them 18 months ago but they have only become much more prevalent in the past year			0
" ms @entity48 says she saw " hundreds of millions " of dollars in sales last year to @entity0 buyers and the pace has intensified since the start of 2012			2
" the past quarter has been our best quarter ever in terms of sales to @entity0 buyers			2
" properties that have been snapped up by @entity0 's rich range from $ 1m apartments to $ 20m trophy properties			2
" buying groups " -- group tours of mainland buyers coming to @entity54 to view properties -- have become commonplace , says ms @entity48			0
" it 's a market that we are now targeting heavily , " she says			0
" we have been recruiting @entity77 - speaking agents and have launched affiliations with brokers in @entity0			2
" reasons for purchases vary , say those who have dealt with overseas @entity0 buyers			2
some are buying because they want to emigrate or they have children who will go to school in the @entity5			0
others buy because the numbers add up : despite its recent dip , the renminbi is still up more than 4 per cent against the @entity5 dollar since the start of 2010 while @entity5 house prices are still in recovery mode and appear cheap compared with @entity95 or @entity18			0
" when you look at how cheap @entity5 real estate is now compared with @entity0 , it makes a lot of sense to buy there , especially since you have more rights when you own a property in @entity5 , " said a wealthy @entity0 investor who has bought several properties in the @entity5 but asked not to be named so as not to draw attention to the fact of shifting assets abroad			1
still others are simply looking for somewhere safe to park their cash			0
in a year that has seen @entity0 affected by political infighting at the top and mounting evidence that the economy faces a bigger - than - expected slowdown , there has been a sharp rise in @entity0 millionaires seeking to settle in the @entity5 or at least to secure residency rights			1
@entity121 , a little - known programme that gives a green card to any foreigner who invests at least $ 500,000 in a business forming 10 or more jobs in the @entity5 , received a record 1,675 @entity0 applications during the first quarter			1
that compares with 2,408 applications in the whole of last year , 772 in 2010 and 63 in 2006			0
" there is no doubt that the political situation back home is having an impact on how @entity0 's rich are thinking of preserving their wealth , " says ms @entity48			0
in @entity0 , all land is owned by the state and investors can only buy leasing rights of usually up to 70 years , rather than to secure outright ownership .			0
