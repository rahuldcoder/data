-- on tuesday , the @entity1 added another reason to drop the politics and get down to the hard work of health care reform			1
the nonpartisan organization released a report that finds the cost of repealing the reform will balloon government deficits by $ 109 billion between 2013 and 2022			1
the @entity1 's report reveals the practical hurdles to repeal and underscores a growing pattern in which the key stakeholders -- states , medical providers , businesses , insurers and consumer groups -- are moving beyond the partisan squabble to the no - nonsense work of building the market place of 2014 , where everyone will be able to purchase affordable insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions			1
doctors , hospitals , insurers and employers are , of course , bargaining to improve their specific stakes			2
they harbor reservations and uncertainties , but their general approach is " mend it , not end it			0
" the medical providers welcome relief from the crushing burden of uncompensated care and from the immorality of leaving the ill without adequate care owing to patients ' inability to pay			1
insurers look forward to new customers and to a new public conversation that spotlights the broader causes of high medical costs rather than blaming insurers alone			1
large employers are nervous about rising costs but are generally more concerned about moderating the rate of growth and ending a system that often shifts costs to them in the financial burden of caring for the uninsured			0
a series of developments reveals the growing gap between the new reality on the ground and the lingering efforts of those who want to refight battles and repeal the law that the @entity71 declared constitutional in june			0
@entity73 gov. @entity72 called @entity74 -- the program for the indigent -- the " @entity77 " because he did n't believe it was feasible or would prove seaworthy			0
meanwhile , private business checked their bottom line and readily saw the new opportunities			0
our nation 's second - largest insurer , @entity82 , paid $ 4.9 billion in cash to purchase another insurance company , @entity86 , to dramatically expand its ability to service the expanding number of people in @entity74			0
@entity90 is doubling down on insurers who do @entity74 business because of their confidence in the @entity74 expansion			0
as repealers complain , the marketplace created 89 new accountable care organizations , which were formed in 40 states to deliver more cost - effective care to more than 1 million people by july 1			1
with great fanfare , @entity103 @entity102 held a hearing earlier this month to profile how health reform interferes with patient care			1
there 's one problem : they are unable to feature the leading voices of patient care -- the @entity113 and @entity114 -- because those organizations support reform as good for patients			1
and then , of course , we have the voters			0
only about a fifth push for full repeal			0
and many @entity123 , including rank - and - file republicans , support new protections against insurers who turn away customers with pre-existing conditions or terminate policies when the costs of care pass annual limits			1
even if @entity102 won the @entity103 and congressional majorities in november , the frustrating legislative trapdoors that slowed and nearly killed health reform in 2009 and 2010 will likely remain hurdles to repeal			2
the reluctance of stakeholders , states and voters will stir consternation , delay and deadlock			2
the growing talk among @entity102 of what would replace " repeal " is an early indicator of the changes afoot			0
@entity150 senate majority leader @entity150 recently offered a dose of reality to calm repeal fever when he counseled that " it 's a lot harder to undo something than it is to stop it in the first place			2
" @entity160 's position may be the most revealing			0
against driving hailstorms from those favoring repeal , he has continued to support his reform in @entity165 because he knows where stakeholders stand			2
while he wo n't force states to implement his or the national reforms ( he says he 'd like to repeal the @entity170 ) , his continued support for the @entity165 reform will make it very difficult for him to deny other states the same opportunity that president @entity176 gave him			2
reform of @entity123 's health care system is under way , reconfiguring how care is provided and paid for			1
it is time to shift from symbolism and theatrics to the details of improving the transition that is occurring			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 and @entity189 .			1

@entity188 , @entity191 : cost of repealing health care reform will increase deficits
key stakeholders are starting to build the new health market place , they say
states , medical providers , businesses , insurers and consumers **embrace** reform
@entity188 , @entity189 : it 's time to put aside politics and **embrace** the new health care system
