-- forget almost everything you ever thought you knew about the moon			2
@entity5 's latest missions indicate the moon is much more than a dead , unchanging satellite orbiting @entity8			1
it 's a dynamic environment , with changes occurring by the day and week , not over millions of years			1
the space agency says the missions are rewriting lunar science text books and revolutionizing what scientists know about @entity8 's closest neighbor			1
an announcement in november probably rivaled @entity19 's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier : there 's water on the moon			1
the @entity24 , or @entity25 , and its companion spacecraft crashed into a crater at the moon 's south pole in october and discovered water in a very dark and very cold place			1
l - cross researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater , which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep			1
@entity33 , @entity5 's chief lunar scientist on the l - cross mission , said the probes detected more than water in the crater , but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is			1
" we 're opening new chapters			0
and in fact , because some of this information is so new and it 's so different from the way we use to think about the moon , there are chapters that are blank right now , " he said			1
you know that they 're going to written , but we do n't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information			0
" @entity33 describes the lunar data as a treasure trove			2
the moon " is like the dusty attic of the solar system , in that things get collected there and they give you insight , not just into the moon , but the evolution of the solar system			0
" @entity69 explorations , such as @entity71 's historic journey to the @entity72 in the early 19th century , carry critically necessary items , but they have no need to haul wood or water			1
that 's not so for manned space flight			2
those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet 's surface			2
the presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond			1
@entity5 is also mapping the moon 's surface in unprecedented detail , eventually creating the first moon atlas			1
the @entity98 , which launched last summer , is the robotic scout that is providing the data			0
@entity98 is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit			0
@entity33 said @entity98 is carrying high - resolution cameras , which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon , including the @entity110 mission landing sites			1
" we have cameras on board that have been able to image where the @entity110 spacecraft landed , and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages , where the astronauts walked on the moon , " according to @entity33			1
the @entity98 discovered it 's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters , where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero @entity123 , or 249 degrees below zero @entity124			0
that 's not far from absolute zero , defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero @entity124 and a temperature that can not be physically reached			0
these are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system			0
the @entity98 is also measuring space radiation on the moon			2
astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations			0
all this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020 , the the target date set by the @entity145 administration in 2004			0
but it 's more than that			0
@entity33 sum it up this way : " we used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place , that the moon was a dead planet			0
... there are changes that occur there not over the course of thousands or millions or even billions of years , but are changing over the course of days and weeks and months			0
that 's something people just had n't thought of until just weeks and months ago			0
... this is n't your grandfather 's moon anymore			2

discovery of water in lunar crater could boost efforts for future astronaut visits
