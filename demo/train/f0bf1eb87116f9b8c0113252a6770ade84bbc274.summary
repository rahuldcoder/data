for the first time since facing an onslaught of criticism this year over his foreign policy views , sen. @entity0 spelled out his national security principles thursday in a comprehensive speech			1
the @entity8 @entity7 , who 's aggressively laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign , sought to paint himself as a champion of " conservative realism , " a doctrine that skates between the hawkish and dovish ends of the foreign policy spectrum			1
" yes , we need a hammer ready , but not every civil war is a nail , " he said in @entity18 at the @entity19 , a think - tank founded by former president @entity21			0
" we need a foreign policy that recognized our limits , preserves our might and a common sense conservative realism of strength and action , " he added			1
@entity0 : @entity34 's ' barnacled enablers ' push for constant war @entity0 attempted to address critics that characterize his views as isolationist and was aiming to approach his speech thursday from the perspective of a major , would - be @entity43 leader , rather than a lawmaker , a spokesman told @entity45 before the speech			1
he sketched out how and when he would advocate for the use of force , saying he would only do so if he felt the @entity43 or its interests were threatened			1
he said he supported the response to @entity51 after 9/11 , for example , but disagrees with the continued @entity43 presence in @entity54			2
@entity0 takes veiled swipe at @entity56 " it 's hard to understand our current objective			2
stalemate and perpetual policing seems to be our mission now in @entity54 , @entity62 , @entity63 , " he said			0
" a precondition for the use of force must be a clear end and a goal			0
" he went on to underscore his widely known position that a president should seek authorization from @entity71 before taking military action			0
@entity0 recycled his own criticism that president @entity76 , " urged on by ( former secretary of state ) @entity74 , " took action in @entity78 without approval , yet now the country is a " sanctuary for terror groups across @entity83			2
" " @entity43 should n't fight wars where the best outcome is stalemate			2
@entity43 should n't fight wars when there is no plan for victory			2
@entity43 should n't fight wars that are n't authorized by the @entity43 people , " he said			2
@entity0 responds to @entity7 criticism " @entity43 should and will fight wars when the consequences -- intended and unintended -- are worth the sacrifice , " he continued			1
" the war on terror is not over , and @entity43 can not disengage from the world			0
" he also talked at length about maintaining diplomatic relationships abroad and expressed support for using sanctions to underwrite diplomacy against countries such as @entity106 and @entity107			0
and he reiterated a stance he has consistently taken : that the country 's debt is one of its biggest national security threats			0
@entity113 : @entity0 is ' not familiar with the facts ' his speech comes as he attempts to further distance himself from the more libertarian views trumpeted by his father , three - time presidential candidate and former congressman @entity119			1
with an eye on the presidency , @entity0 has sought to broaden his appeal to establishment republicans and even @entity124			0
the attention has attracted close scrutiny of his views and past statements on foreign policy , as @entity0 has been known to frequently break with his own party and lean toward staying out of foreign entanglements			1
( last month he slammed hawkish lawmakers for being " barnacled enablers " that have " never met a war they did n't like			0
" ) @entity0 : aid to @entity136 ok -- for now he was widely panned this year when he evolved in his opinion about the crisis in @entity139 , as well as the threat of @entity141 in the @entity142 , as both situations continued to worsen			0
on @entity141 , for example , he penned an opinion piece earlier this summer openly questioning the value of launching airstrikes against militants in @entity62			0
but not long after the beheading of @entity43 @entity150 , @entity0 became supportive of a @entity43 - led air campaign against the terrorist organization -- a change that critics made sure to highlight as a massive flip - flop but what @entity0 reluctantly admitted as a change in views based on the situation at hand , the " realist " side of his worldview			1
thursday night , he stressed his support for airstrikes as a way to " rebalance " the region but reiterated his opposition to another key part of @entity76 's strategy : arming @entity63 rebels to fight @entity141 militants			0
he expressed doubt that @entity141 will be dismantled in the future , saying in the end it will be up to the countries in the region to take care of the situation			0
@entity180 , press secretary for the @entity181 , argued that @entity0 wo n't be able to overcome confusion about @entity0 's foreign policy with just one speech			1
" for months , @entity0 has been twisting in the wind , trying to explain his foreign policy vision , " he said			1
" the fact is , a speech defending the indefensible wo n't make @entity0 's worldview any more palatable to the @entity43 people			1

@entity0 hits back at critics with a big foreign policy speech .
