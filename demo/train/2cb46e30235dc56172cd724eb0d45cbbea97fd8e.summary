@entity0 -- most @entity2 treat prime minister @entity4 's new economic program , dubbed " @entity5 , " with a heavy dose of skepticism			1
if there is a miracle cure for @entity2 's decades - long malaise , then it 'll have to be seen to be believed			1
and @entity4 himself admits it will take time for salaries to rise and for the real economy to respond to treatment			1
but in @entity0 's central @entity23 district , four young @entity5 devotees dressed in giant glittery bow - ties and denim mini-skirts are handing out fliers			1
they chant : " we 're the @entity25 -- please come to our concert ' ! " granted , it 's less the promise of massive public spending programs , the whirring of the monetary printing press or the slightly ambiguous growth strategies pulling in the punters here			2
it 's more about the girl band 's coquettish sales pitch			2
" when the economy is good the skirt lengths get shorter , " says 20 - year - old band member @entity37			0
" so when the @entity41 goes below 9,000 we wear long skirts ; when it 's between 10 and 11,000 we go medium - length , and miniskirts when it 's 11 to 13,000			2
" their signature tune " @entity5 " has only been on sale a couple of weeks , but the audience seem to know it			1
an assortment of geeky 20 - something males and the odd suited salaryman faithfully mirror the girls ' dance - routine , punching the air with glow - sticks when the refrain comes through			0
perhaps it 's because the @entity41 's wedged firmly above 13,000 , so they 're treated to the girls in bloomers			2
i ask @entity37 what @entity5 means to her			1
" the weaker yen probably means prices will go up , " she says without missing a beat			2
" but that helps exports			0
and i think companies will start to earn more and that will boost consumer spending			2
" that is the theory but it requires a shift in thinking			0
" our biggest problem is that the general public has been stuck with deflation -- in mind and heart -- for the past 20 years , " @entity2 's finance minister @entity74 told @entity1 's @entity75 recently			1
" people do n't buy things today because they think tomorrow it will be cheaper			0
unless this mindset changes and people start buying things , consumption , which is near 70 % of @entity88 , wo n't grow			0
" @entity89 set up an academy in 2007 to teach amateur traders how to make money on the markets			2
in the last few months of the @entity41 's meteoric rise he 's experienced a flood of applicants			0
but he tells them not to hold out hope that @entity5 will do much in the long term			1
" it 's good for the stock market but not for the economy as a whole			1
it could lead to a bubble , though i do n't think it will be as bad as it was back in the 1980s , " he said , referring to the spectacular crash that followed decades of soaring stock and real estate values in @entity2			1
@entity111 's signed up because she made a bad investment in 2008 and is wondering what to do with her money now the market 's up			0
she 's hoping @entity5 boosts her husband 's salary			1
" in the past i 've tried to save because his salary was low			0
but if things change then i might spend more , this stock market investment is part of that			0
" back on stage , the @entity25 finish their song in a blaze of multi-colored lights , before they settle in for a chat with the fans			0
but when the girls ask whether anyone 's bought the single , there 's not much of a response			0
the appeal here is more show than substance			0
precisely what critics fear so - called @entity5 will turn out to be too .			1

prime minister @entity4 's new economic program is dubbed " @entity5 "
many are skeptical about whether this is the *solution* for @entity2 's malaise
some fear the boost to the country 's stock markets could produce a bubble
1980s collapse followed decades of growing stock , *property* prices
