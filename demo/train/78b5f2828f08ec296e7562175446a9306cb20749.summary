@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is back at it again -- once more in the waters off @entity0 and heading , she hopes , to @entity6 , @entity7			1
the 62 - year - old endurance athlete jumped into waters off @entity1 on saturday afternoon , a day earlier than she and her @entity10 had originally planned , according to her @entity12 page			1
if all goes well , she will swim some 103 miles and 60 hours before arriving in the @entity13			1
" right now , ( the water ) is fantastic and so ( the team ) has been brainstorming and thinking , we 've got to get out there , " @entity3 said at a saturday news conference , explaining the decision to start early			1
shortly before 10:30 p.m. saturday , nearly seven hours into her journey , a new @entity12 message from @entity3 's team indicated the swimmer had been " stung by a jellyfish			1
" an update a few minutes later indicated she was stung at 8:40 p.m. , " was treated and continued swimming			0
" " ( @entity3 ) is ok and strong , " the message said			2
@entity3 has tried three times before to venture across the @entity29			2
each attempt ended prematurely -- starting in 1978 when rocky seas left her battered , delirious and less than halfway toward her goal and twice last year , once done in by an 11 - hour asthma attack and later thwarted by box jellyfish stings			1
but those aborted swims have n't deterred her , and she insisted earlier this week that " i 'm ready			0
" " i 'm feeling some pressure , " she said friday			0
" i 'm feeling tremendous inner pressure that this has got to be it , this has got to be the last time			0
" she 's in the water without a physical shark cage , relying on electronic shark repellent and a team of divers to keep them away			2
sharks are just one of the many challenges the @entity51 citizen will face , from the sheer physical strain to smacks of jellyfish and the whims of @entity56			1
that latter consideration drove the decision to push up the scheduled sunday start time			0
the wind is predicted " to be getting really calm by ( sunday ) morning and staying calm ... through monday , and coming up a little bit on tuesday but still just fine for us to get in , " @entity3 said			2
the hope is to avoid deteriorating conditions caused by stronger winds expected tuesday night and into wednesday , which happens to be @entity3 's 63rd birthday			1
" we 've got to get out there , " she said			0
in the 1970s , @entity3 was unstoppable			2
in addition to winning multiple swimming marathons , she was one of the first women to encircle the island of @entity75 , and she holds the world 's record for longest ocean swim -- 102.5 miles from the island of @entity80 in the @entity81 to @entity82 , @entity7			1
she said saturday that she was 8 years old when she first dreamed about the possibility of swimming across the @entity29			0
-- at the time , she was in @entity1 on a trip from her home in @entity7 in the 1950s , before @entity84 led a @entity86 takeover in @entity1 and its relations with the @entity51 soured			1
" i used to stand on the beach and i said to my mother , ' i wonder if anybody could swim over there , " @entity3 recalled saying , while pointing to the @entity13			1
while admitting that she 's a slower swimmer now than she once was , @entity3 insists that in her 60s she still feels " vital ( and ) powerful " -- and definitely " not old			1
" a successful swim ideally will inspire people her age and older not to let their age hinder them , @entity3 said			2
" when i walk up on that shore in @entity7 , i want millions of those @entity100 sisters and brothers to look at me and say , ' i 'm going to go write that novel i thought it was too late to do			0
i 'm going to go work in @entity104 on that farm that those people need help at			0
i 'm going to adopt a child			0
it 's not too late , i can still live my dreams , ' " she said			0
