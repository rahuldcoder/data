@entity0 -- employees at the @entity4 office of the @entity5 know that they have to put in 80 hours of work every two weeks			1
some employers understand that your working at the expense of everything else in your life is n't good for you ... or for them			2
but they can configure those hours pretty much how they 'd like , with the exception of the one day a week their managers require all employees to be at the office at the same time			2
plus , they can work from home for some of the week , or they can work compressed weeks so that they can take every fifth or 10th day off and still log their 80 hours			1
those policies are why that @entity5 office is among the recipients of the @entity25 awards for excellence in workplace flexibility given by the @entity28 and @entity29 ( @entity30 ) every year			0
three - quarters of big organizations now offer flexible - work benefits , according to @entity34			1
@entity35 in its survey of mid- and large - sized companies found that flexible work schedules was the most commonly offered benefit , followed by telecommuting and compressed work weeks			1
but just because an @entity42 policy exists does n't mean that your employer has your back if you 're afraid to take advantage of it			0
that 's why @entity30 recognizes employers that have flexibility policies that are both innovative and regularly used by employees			0
here are just a few examples from among @entity30 's 2007 winners			0
at @entity56 's @entity55 office , all employees have some flexibility in their schedules , even those staffing call centers			0
they can choose the hours they work between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. , which lets them , for instance , pick up or drop off their kids during the day			2
at the 16 - member @entity65 in @entity67 , telecommuting is n't a problem , even from across the country			1
rather than lose two of its best employees , who were moving to other states , the firm 's founder , @entity70 , let them work remotely from their new homes			2
@entity70 told @entity30 that she attributes the tripling of her company 's revenue in part to the firm 's flexibility , noting that one of the relocated employees brought in a whole new roster of clients as a result of the move			0
@entity88 makes its money on innovation , and burn - out rarely produces innovative ideas			2
that 's why employees at the company 's @entity95 , @entity97 , office get two paid consecutive months off every seven years			0
they also get reimbursed for tuition if they 're pursuing further education and can use company time to pursue a degree , either by using comp time or making up for the time spent in class by working on evenings or weekends			0
sabbaticals are also an option at @entity111 , a small insurance firm in @entity4 with 14 employees			0
they get an extra month 's vacation for every five years they work and may take two consecutive months off during their sabbatical year			2
regular and flexible time - off is critical , too , especially when salaries are n't huge and talented employees can make more elsewhere			1
at the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) , employees start with two - and - a - half weeks ' vacation and after three years , get a full month			1
they also can roll over any of their unused sick days ( they get 13 a year ) and use them for any medical need , including taking care of a sick family member , or for bereavement			0
at no time do you appreciate your employer 's flexibility more than when you need to take time to care for a child or handle a family crisis			0
under federal law , companies with at least 50 employees must let employees take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year to care for a new baby , a sick family member or their own medical problems			1
this week , the author of that legislation , sen. @entity144 ( @entity145 ) , co-sponsored a bill calling for companies to provide 8 of those 12 weeks to be paid			1
at @entity153 's @entity152 office , new mothers with at least a year 's tenure at the firm get three paid months of leave plus up to 19 weeks of unpaid leave			1
new fathers get six weeks of paid leave if they are the primary caregiver , two weeks if they are not			1
for employees who adopt , they get 16 weeks of leave , of which six are paid if the employee is the primary caregiver , or two otherwise but then an additional four weeks of paid leave is available when the primary parent goes back to work			1
for parents who choose to leave their jobs , @entity153 stays in touch , calling them when new work opportunities at the firm arise			1
employees caring for a close relative , meanwhile , can take up to 16 weeks of leave without fear of losing their jobs			2
the payoff for the firm is huge			0
@entity174 , the accounting firm 's @entity176 , told @entity30 , " the cost of our flexibility practices is nothing compared to the cost of losing good people and hiring and training new ones			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity34 : *75* *percent* of big organizations offer flexible - work benefits
many companies by law have to grant up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually
telecommuting and compressed work weeks also common benefits
