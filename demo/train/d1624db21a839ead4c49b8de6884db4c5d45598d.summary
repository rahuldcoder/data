-- talk with two people who have been to @entity2 and you 'll get very different views on what a trip there is like			1
one person will speak of the allure of wandering through a warren of market streets ; the other will complain of getting lost over and over again			2
one will tell you that people there are among the friendliest they 've met , if you can meet them halfway on the language			2
the other will say that the locals are only out to make money and not even directions are free			2
the food is exotic yet easy on the palate , or restaurants serve up bland @entity25 © s that still manage to turn you inside out			2
and they would both be correct			2
bottom line : @entity2 is not for the timid traveler			1
my wife and i visited last november			2
we had heard it had much of what we look for in a travel destination : centuries of history coupled with a very modern vibe			1
the city has a @entity41 feel , from the brand - name stores to the widespread use of @entity44 as a second or third language			1
the crowded souks and calls to prayer from the mosque minarets are what you would find at the heart of a @entity53 country			2
it is the outline of the @entity55 that reminds you that this is @entity58			0
share your @entity60 tips and photos the city 's origins stretch back to the 11th century			1
back then @entity2 was a key trading route with @entity66 cities			1
and like other hubs -- bruges as a @entity41 port , @entity70 on the @entity71 -- @entity2 had its golden epoch before falling from favor			1
the result is that parts of the city within the rose - colored walls and imposing gates surrounding the medina , or @entity81 , have a sense of being frozen in time			1
the massive @entity83 is likely to be the focal point of your time in @entity2 , both as a destination and as a much - needed reference point			1
it is one of @entity58 's largest squares , and as long as the city has existed it has been a place where storytellers , musicians , healers and just about everyone else has gathered			1
during the day you ca n't walk through it without some snake charmer or henna tattoo artist offering to make your stay more memorable			1
at night , they push aside to make way for innumerable food stalls offering as genuine a selection of @entity106 cuisine as you 'll find at any restaurant			1
grills sizzle beneath tiny merguez sausages and fish and skewers of vegetables			0
for the more adventurous , there is boiled goat head or bowls of snails			0
more than once we were brought food that we did n't order , like the deep red harira soup and a basket of bread , maybe some fresh olives			0
we paid for it anyway , and frankly , it was worth it			0
it exposed us to foods we may not have tried otherwise			0
just plan on paying a bit more than you might have expected			0
later , you 'll walk it off as you wander amid the chaos , moving to incessant drum beats and chants , trying your best to take it all in			0
just north of the @entity83 you 'll find the myriad alleyways of the @entity2 souk , or traditional market quarter			1
no map will help you navigate these passages ; just accept that you are going to get lost and enjoy yourself along the way			0
while souvenir stalls are everywhere , you can still find shops selling items of remarkable craftsmanship that reflect local designs -- whether it is in the intricate patterns and colored glass of the hanging lamps , or leather goods from the tannery in another part of the city			1
and trust me , the shop owners are always ready to make a deal			0
make eye contact with a market trader , and before you know it you 're haggling over the price of something that you may or may not need , but will provide a terrific story when you get back home			1
nothing here has a set price , and shopkeepers can be aggressive when they think you are interested in something			0
but no trip to @entity2 would be complete without trying your hand at negotiating			1
at some point you realize that the hardest thing about visiting @entity2 is that you are usually moving at someone else 's pace			1
the streets of the souk are jammed with people who are either jostling to get past you or quite content standing in your way			0
you and the other pedestrians will be on the lookout for young people on motorbikes heading in both directions			0
and everyone will try to maneuver around donkey - pulled carts			0
but anywhere you go -- and this is what makes a trip to @entity2 so special -- is an assault on the senses			1
it could be the vibrant colors of the shops selling mounds of rich spices or hand - tied rugs , the smell of food cooking , the press of the crowd , or the calls of the souk			0
when all the bustle gets to be too much , there are plenty of sites that give you a chance to relax			2
south of the @entity83 stands the 19th century @entity215 and gardens , originally built for a high - ranking official and his concubines			1
you wo n't find a palace in the sense of @entity221 or the @entity222			0
instead , you 'll meander through a series of rooms with little more than lavishly decorated floors , walls and ceilings , leading to courtyards with fruit trees and fountains			0
we walked through the palace on our own , though i suspect a proper tour could be organized			0
the @entity235 , a former boarding school where for hundreds of years young men studied the @entity238 , will amaze you with its intricate stucco and cedar carvings			0
or just sit in the shadow of the @entity242 , an important example of the region 's @entity244 architecture			2
or simply hop on one of the tour buses at the far end of @entity83 and check out @entity2 's modern @entity250 district			1
staying in @entity2 is best experienced at a riad , a traditional @entity106 home built around a central courtyard			1
the whole idea was originally to create as private a dwelling as possible , so even finding the entrance to one can be a challenge ( always ask your hosts if someone can meet you , if not at the airport , at least at the edge of the @entity81 to get you there )			0
the best have only a few rooms , each uniquely decorated and appointed			0
your hosts will be more than ready to offer suggestions on where to eat , what to see , or just to offer a soothing cup of tea on the rooftop terrace			0
soothing tea aside , when you get back from @entity2 , do n't expect to feel relaxed			1
exhausted is more like it			0
you will have navigated more alleyways , gotten lost more times and told more people " no , thank you " for one reason or another than you should on a vacation			0
but a few weeks later , when you are looking back over the pictures you took , none of that will matter much			2
all you 'll remember will be the sights and sounds that make @entity2 so special			1
and you 'll be thinking about when you might go back .			2

@entity2 is not for the timid traveler . but if you 're up for an adventure , it 's a great destination
the city 's origins stretch back to the 11th century , and there 's plenty of history to *explore*
for the full experience , stay at a riad , a traditional @entity106 home built around a central courtyard
