@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the anti-corruption crusader who co-founded @entity4 , called tuesday night for action to lift the veil on who owns corporations around the world			1
she made that wish as she accepted the $ 1 million @entity11 at the @entity13 conference			1
" my wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good			0
let 's ignite world opinion , change the law , and together launch a new era of openness in business			0
" her call to expose criminals and corrupt officials came at the end of the first full day of @entity13 's 30th anniversary conference			1
earlier , another speaker on transparency , @entity31 , argued his case that @entity35 surveillance programs infringe privacy for no real benefit			1
in her @entity39 wish , @entity3 made the case that the identity of corporate owners should n't be kept private			1
she said the development of a public registry of corporate ownership would enable the exposure of tax evasion , terrorism , drug trafficking , conflict minerals , sanctions busting and political corruption			0
" this truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight , " @entity3 said			2
in states such as @entity57 , she said , it 's easier to set up a company than to get a library card , and in 10 minutes of online shopping you can have a corporation to shield your identity			0
as examples of the need to ferret out the true ownership of companies , she cited the investigation of the assets owned by the ousted regime of @entity73 in @entity74 and said the impoverished people of the @entity76 had been cheated of a billion dollars by anonymous companies			0
@entity3 and her two @entity4 co-founders have also received the $ 1 million @entity79 for @entity80			1
@entity4 was founded 20 years ago and gained fame in part from its reporting on how the diamond trade was fueling conflict in @entity86			2
she says the @entity88 government and the @entity89 are " on board " in support of the public registry , and that her group is working to get support from the administration of @entity96 president @entity95			0
" @entity96 is the next big target , " @entity3 said			2
" it has to come on board			0
" she said the @entity96 and @entity88 account for a majority of the cases in which shielded corporate ownership is used to hide crime			0
two @entity96 senators , democrat @entity108 of @entity109 and @entity111 @entity110 of @entity112 have introduced a bill that would require states to ask people seeking to set up corporations to disclose their true owners			1
" today , money launderers , arms dealers , drug lords , terrorists and tax evaders are too often able to conceal their misconduct behind a wall of corporate secrecy , " @entity108 said in a statement			0
the topics of secrecy and privacy came up in a different context when @entity31 told the @entity13 conference from an undisclosed location in @entity133 on tuesday that " we do n't have to give up our liberty to have security			1
" appearing on a small screen mounted on a rolling , swiveling robot that looked a bit like an upright vacuum cleaner , the former @entity35 contractor said , " i am proof that you can go up against the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world and win			2
" @entity31 said he does n't think of himself as a hero , but @entity13 curator @entity146 asked the audience of 1,200 whether he had performed a heroic act , and many agreed			1
@entity149 , the inventor of the @entity150 , was asked to come on stage and also said he would classify @entity31 as a hero			2
a minority of those in the audience raised their hands to say they considered @entity31 's release of classified government information a " reckless " act			2
@entity31 endorsed @entity149 's argument that this year 's 25th anniversary of the @entity150 should be the occasion for a new " magna carta " establishing the right to online freedom			2
he said people deserve a right to privacy when they order a book online , call their families or travel and should n't be subject to how the government will interpret their acts later			0
@entity31 argued that surveillance has n't prevented terrorist acts and that the fight against terrorism is a cover for intrusive government agencies			1
the most important thing private companies can do to protect consumers is to encrypt their data , @entity31 said			1
he said the action of someone ordering a copy of the book " 1984 " on @entity190 can be discovered by intelligence agencies because the data is not encrypted			0
asked about criticism by former vice president @entity194 that he has done enormous damage to @entity96 's national security , @entity31 said that " going to war with people who are not our enemies , in places that are n't threats , does n't make us safe			0
" @entity31 , who has worked with journalists to reveal the secrets he obtained from his work with the @entity35 , said there will be more revelations			1
" some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come , " he said .			0

@entity3 , co-founder of @entity4 , *awarded* $ 1 million @entity39
her group campaigns for disclosure of true owners of corporations to fight corruption
@entity13 conference also features @entity31 , who assails @entity35 surveillance
@entity31 says some of his most important revelations have yet to be made
