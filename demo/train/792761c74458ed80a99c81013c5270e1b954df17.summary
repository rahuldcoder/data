to the @entity7 -- for now			2
the system will be rolled out for june 's @entity9 in @entity10 , which serves as a warm up event for the 2014 tournament			0
should the system perform adequately , @entity1 will be the official @entity6 provider when the @entity7 heads to @entity10 for the second time next year			1
the technology , which uses 14 high - speed cameras ( 7 per goal ) around the stadium , beat off competition from three other providers			1
this came even though @entity1 was the last of the four to receive a @entity7 license , only doing so last month			2
" while all four companies had previously met the stringent technical requirements of the @entity30 , " said football 's world governing body in a statement , " the final decision was based on criteria relating more specifically to the tournaments in @entity10 , including the company 's ability to adapt to local conditions and the compatibility of each @entity6 system in relation to @entity7 match operations			1
" " the respective bids were also judged on cost and project management factors such as staffing and time schedules for installation			0
the use of @entity48 in @entity10 is subject to a final installation test at each stadium			0
" following a tender process that began in february and involved presentations to @entity7 as well as visits to some of @entity10 's leading stadiums , the companies that missed out were @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
while both @entity57 and @entity58 use magnetic fields around the goal and need to insert a chip in the ball , @entity59 and @entity1 use a 3d imaging system to determine the precise location of the ball			2
the successful bidder , @entity1 , believes that one of its strengths is the fact that neither the ball nor goal structure need to be changed for the system to work -- with referees receiving a vibration and optical signal in their watches to inform them of a successful score			1
nonetheless , it will still cost an estimated us $ 260,000 to install the system into a stadium while the running costs are considerably lower -- at just under us $ 4,000 per game			1
@entity1 's high - speed cameras are located high in the stadium and , according to the company 's website , are " connected to a powerful image processing computer system which tracks the movement of all objects on the pitch and filters out the players , referees and all disturbing objects			1
" the remaining object is the ball and the system knows its three dimensional position with a precision of a few millimeters in the coordinate system of the pitch			0
" the @entity105 company @entity59 aside , the three other companies bidding for the @entity7 tender were all @entity2			0
coincidentally , it was a @entity7 match between @entity107 and @entity108 , at the 2010 finals in @entity110 , that prompted a @entity7 rethink on @entity6			2
@entity7 president @entity112 had long denied the need for such technology but he changed his mind after seeing @entity117 @entity116 have a goal ruled out in a 4 - 1 loss even though the ball had clearly crossed the line			1
the theory is that such human refereeing error will be eradicated following the implementation of @entity6 , which was first used at december 's @entity125 in @entity126			0
however , the system was never put to the test during a competition won by @entity130 of @entity10 since all the goals that were scored clearly crossed the line			0
before every game , match officials will conduct tests to determine that the @entity6 system is working correctly -- with @entity7 hoping to showcase @entity1 's technology prior to this year 's @entity9			1
while @entity7 are embracing @entity6 , @entity139 football body @entity138 are steadfastly refusing to use the new technology -- with president @entity141 saying it is too expensive			1
the @entity142 says he would prefer the cost of installing the system in @entity138 's leading stadiums , which he says will cost some us $ 70m , to be spent on youth football			2
meanwhile , @entity147 , the former @entity148 referee who now serves on @entity138 's @entity149 , has previously expressed his belief that no @entity6 system can ever be perfect			0
" i 'm not sure that technology can be 100 % perfect -- for example , my mobile phone and my computer sometimes do n't work , " he told @entity0			0
" i would have been happy to have had two more sets of eyes in the penalty area , " added @entity147 , effectively registering support for @entity138 's system of using extra officials behind the goal - line .			1

camera - based @entity1 win tender to provide goal - line technology for @entity7
system will be used for @entity168 if @entity9 trials prove successful
cost of installing preferred @entity6 in a stadium is us $ 260,000
