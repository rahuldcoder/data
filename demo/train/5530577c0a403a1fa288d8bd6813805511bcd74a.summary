a best picture nomination is not exactly nothing			2
many would argue that it 's just about everything			2
yet there was brush - fire - level rage on and off the @entity9 -- see # @entity10 -- following thursday morning 's announcement of this year 's @entity13 nominations over the fact that " @entity20 , " the critically acclaimed drama about @entity17 's epochal campaign for voting rights in the @entity19 , received only two @entity21 nods , one of them for best picture			1
( the other was for best song : " glory , " the @entity27 - winning anthem co-written by @entity28 and @entity29 , which one can safely label the prohibitive early favorite its category			0
) much of the anger was tilted , especially , toward the omission of the film 's director , @entity35 , whose nomination would have broken fresh ground as the first @entity40 woman to compete for the best director @entity21			1
@entity43 's performance as @entity17 was likewise snubbed for a best actor slot while neither @entity46 's original screenplay nor @entity48 's cinematography , both deemed worthy competitors by movie critics , received the @entity13 's acknowledgment in both their respective categories			0
" @entity20 's " partisans cried racism at the @entity13 voters , even though a few of these critics pointed out that this was the pretty much the same @entity13 that a year ago conferred the best picture , best adapted screenplay and best supporting actress @entity13 to " 12 years a slave			1
" i was prepared to offer that perspective , too -- until i noticed a distressing dichotomy looming on this branch			0
a depiction of @entity40 in shameful , soul - depleting captivity is one thing ; @entity40 organized in open rebellion against their oppressors is very much another			0
movie history has many films with black slaves and black victims			2
it 's much harder to think of a @entity79 movie in which @entity40 are depicted as the active agents of their own salvation			1
" @entity20 " is one of those movies			1
and its relative dearth of worthy nominations is viewed , fairly or not , as a collective snub of not just a movie , but of @entity40 ' vision of their own empowerment			2
it may have been bad timing , as the movie 's nationwide release only took place last weekend			0
and many blamed @entity96 's opinion piece in the @entity97 , which excoriated " @entity20 's " depiction of his former boss , @entity99 , as an impediment in @entity17 's campaign			1
that some journalists brought up @entity96 's grievances in other articles about the film may have contributed to some restraint , at least , in the campaign for greater @entity21 support by @entity109 , @entity20 's distributor			1
but one wonders about this : we are in a time when the voting rights legislation passed 50 years ago with the active support of both @entity17 and @entity99 is under siege both in the courts and in some states			2
why are people less focused on this clear and present danger and more caught up in questions of historical veracity of a @entity79 movie ? well ... we 're still weeks away from the final vote			0
and however the chatter has leaned on " @entity20 , " those who support the movie should be grateful that there is chatter at all carrying the movie to the finish line			1
with @entity79 , one never knows			0
that best picture nomination could very well become a best picture win			0
why ? why not ?			0

@entity134 : at # @entity10 , many *complain* the ' @entity21 snub is about race
he says consider *difference* between @entity21 support for " 12 years a slave " and " @entity20 "
@entity144 : one is about blacks as victims ; one is about strong blacks as agents of their own salvation
