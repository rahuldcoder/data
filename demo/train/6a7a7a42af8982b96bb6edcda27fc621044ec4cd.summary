-- these days , there are many less flattering things you could say about a movie than that it 's enjoyable in a square , uncomplicated , stirringly old - fashioned way			2
42 , a sports drama about how @entity8 broke the color line in professional baseball , is in some ways a film that could have been made 30 years ago , or 50 years ago			1
( in fact , it was made 63 years ago : 1950 's @entity15 starred the legendary second baseman himself			0
) the film depicts @entity8 , played by the dazzling , little - known actor @entity18 , as a fearless , noble athlete - crusader — which , of course , is just what he was , though 42 scarcely spends three minutes trying to find any flaws in him ( surely he must have had one ) , or even giving him a sprinkle of idiosyncrasy			1
is the writer - director , @entity27 ( who wrote @entity28 and directed @entity29 ) , worried that we would n't admire @entity8 enough ? @entity27 works in what i think of as a conservative — or maybe it 's just really , really basic — neoclassical @entity34 style , spelling everything out , letting the story unfold in a plainspoken and deliberate fashion , with a big , wide , open pictorial camera eye			1
it 's like the latter - day @entity43 style , applied to material that 's as traditional as can be			2
@entity0 : ' 42 ' aims to be box office @entity46 yet in one vital way , the movie feels very contemporary			0
when @entity8 joined the @entity51 in 1947 , spearheading the civil rights era before it had a name , he was subjected , on and off the field , to a degree of racial antagonism that could almost be called terrorism			1
for all its wholesomely uplifting , message - movie design , 42 makes that struggle look every bit as brutal and scary as it was			1
@entity8 's fellow @entity51 , many of them @entity64 boys , welcome him to the team by signing a petition to have him kicked off			1
he 's booed from the stands , pitchers take open delight in beaning him , and in one scene , when he 's up at bat , the manager of the @entity72 ( @entity71 ) heckles him from the sidelines by calling him the n - word for five unrelenting minutes			0
the way that scene goes on and on is scathingly powerful , as @entity8 can barely keep himself from coming apart			1
@entity18 , a graceful and handsome actor with a deep inner fire , gives @entity8 a stare that 's penetrating and guarded at the same time			1
a lot of the film 's drama is reading that face — the intelligence and masked outrage			1
@entity8 is n't allowed to fight back against any of the viciousness ( if he did , it would look to mainstream @entity88 like he was the troublemaker ) , yet swallowing it eats up his spirit			2
how does he cope ? @entity0 : ' @entity93 new pics by playing the hell out of the game			0
even if he had n't been baseball 's trailblazing crossover star , @entity8 had a talent on the field that was explosive			2
he was a wizard at stealing bases , and the movie glories in his quickness and bravado — how he steps off first base and eases down the path , hopping back and forth like a jackrabbit on a hot stove , holding his arms low , letting his fingers wiggle like nervous antennae			0
42 portrays this athletic showmanship with an element of racial psychodrama			0
@entity8 is n't just teasing the pitchers ( the more they look at him , the less they can tell what he 's going to do next )			2
he 's mocking them , working off his anger			0
he triumphs , and holds on to his sanity , by beating racist players at their own game			0
the movie covers just three years of @entity8 's life , beginning in 1945 , when he 's a @entity125 veteran playing in the @entity126 and gets recruited by the forward - thinking @entity51 general manager , @entity127 , to join his minor - league club , the @entity129			1
as @entity127 , a stogie - chomping grump with a heart of gold , @entity130 seems to have reinvented himself as an actor			1
he gives an ingeniously stylized cartoon performance , his eyes atwinkle , his mouth a rubbery grin , his voice all wily @entity64 music , though with that growl of @entity143 anger just beneath it			0
calling @entity8 into his office , he tells him that he needs a player who does n't so much have the guts to fight back as the guts not to fight back			2
42 is a rousing tribute to how impossible , and therefore heroic , a stance that was			0
