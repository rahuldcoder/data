@entity1 @entity0 says he has the votes to win another term as chairman of the @entity6 , an organization he successfully rebuilt following the 2010 midterm elections			1
@entity0 told @entity6 members of his plan to seek a third term in an email monday night and said that 150 of the 168 party officials and political activists who make up the national organization have pledged to support him , according to a copy of the note obtained by @entity2			1
" with such support it is impossible for me to say no , " @entity0 wrote			0
" therefore , i write to seek your support for another term as @entity6 chairman			1
as some of you may have heard me say , thus far we accomplished about 80 percent of what we needed to accomplish with another 80 percent left to go			0
if we are going to win in 2016 , we must build upon what we were able to accomplish over the last 4 years , and i ask for your continued support to make sure we do in fact accomplish that goal			0
" when @entity0 took over the @entity6 , it was $ 25 million in debt , which he helped to erase by convincing deep - pocketed @entity6 donors to start contributing again to the committee after the controversial chairmanship of @entity36			2
after the 2012 election , @entity0 focused the @entity6 's efforts on upgrading the committee 's technological infrastructure and voter data as well as outreach to minority communities			2
he commissioned a report , the " @entity48 , " that outlined ways for the @entity46 to grow its base			2
republicans largely embraced the report , but social conservatives opposed a recommendation the party be more tolerant of people who are gay			0
at this time , @entity0 has no opponent in the race to lead the national party			0
assuming he wins election to a third term at the @entity59 in january , @entity0 will be on track to be the longest - serving chairman in committee history .			1
