-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 is usually so careful not to expose his @entity4 connection -- his mother was born and educated in @entity6 and he speaks fluent @entity4 -- especially since this tie arguably cost him the @entity2 presidency in 2004 when the nation was being vilified as " cheese eating surrender monkeys " by a conservative columnist			1
but @entity1 's gushing praise for @entity4 , and in @entity4 , on saturday during his visit to @entity6 , could n't have been more dramatic			2
@entity4 is indeed one of the very few world powers that seem ready to join the @entity2 in a military strike on @entity19 's @entity18 regime , with or without @entity21 backing			1
since @entity22 ruled itself out from such intervention through a no vote in parliament on august 29 , to the world 's surprise and @entity29 's dismay , the @entity2 and @entity4 have had to appear even more resolute and closer partners on the world stage than before			1
news emerged of lengthy phone conversations between presidents @entity34 and @entity35 and one - to - one meetings at the @entity37 last friday in @entity38 , with @entity29 conspicuously sidelined			2
after it was reported that an adviser to @entity41 had dismissed the @entity22 as this " little island nobody listens to " , the @entity22 prime minister strangely felt compelled to justify his country 's standing in an improvised and passionate tirade			2
" yes , we are a small island , in fact a small group of islands			0
but i would challenge anyone to come up with a country with a prouder history , with a bigger heart , a greater resilience			0
we are a country that 's invented many of the things that are most worthwhile -- everything from the industrial revolution to the television to the worldwide web			0
" if i go on too long about our literature , our art , our philosophy , our contribution - including the world 's language -- if i start talking about this blessed plot , this sceptered isle , this @entity64 , i might have to put it to music			0
" so while @entity22 was busy licking its wounds , the @entity2 and @entity4 were left to show up their unity and determination			1
words were uttered such as " @entity4 is our oldest ally " ( a historical fact but a hurtful truth to hear for the @entity22 , the @entity2 's most loyal ally ) , however , they did n't manage to hide the increasing discomfort felt by public opinions both in the @entity2 , @entity4 and the world at large			1
the @entity22 mps had , probably despite themselves , opened a @entity89 , also called democracy			2
by conveying what they probably rightly think is the country 's reluctance to engage in what appears as a vaguely - defined military intervention , @entity22 mps did nothing more than to give a voice to their constituents ' concerns			1
disturbed by the @entity22 " no " , president @entity35 , an isolationist at heart , decided to follow the @entity22 route and went on to seek @entity104 ' approval , even though he constitutionally did n't need to			1
this , of course , has left @entity34 in a tricky position			0
here he is , forced to wait for @entity2 congressmen to decide on @entity4 's course of action -- not a happy position to be in when you are the president of a country which , despite its current @entity115 foreign policy , has had a long tradition of independence			1
a debate over the question of @entity19 in @entity4 @entity120 last wednesday , granted by the president but without a vote , furthermore revealed how divided within itself @entity4 is			1
the @entity4 opposition demands that military action be pursued with a @entity21 mandate			1
" if @entity127 keeps blocking the @entity128 over the issue , let @entity34 convoke the @entity130 for an emergency special session			0
under article 377 , the general assembly can overrule the security council " said former @entity133 minister @entity132			0
an argument to which @entity4 public opinion is very sensitive			2
so far though , despite the fact that 68 % of the @entity4 oppose the participation of their country 's troops in an intervention in @entity19 , @entity34 has stood firm with strong words coming both from the @entity146 and @entity4 's foreign affairs minister @entity147			1
the @entity4 media has been visibly split as whether to support the president or warn him against an ill - advised adventure with probable repercussions against @entity4 interests at home and in the region			2
many observers in @entity4 ca n't help thinking that @entity34 seeks on the world stage the charisma and legitimacy that he lacks at home			0
the only time the @entity4 supported him massively since his election is when he launched a military intervention in @entity164 last year which , by all accounts , was a great success			1
a @entity4 diplomat recently confided : " in @entity164 , @entity34 walked on water			0
he wants to repeat the experience			0
" except @entity19 is not @entity164 , nor is it @entity170 or @entity172			0
in 2003 , @entity4 tried to convince its allies , the @entity2 and @entity22 , that there was no ground to the @entity177 's scare which so diligently triggered @entity172 's invasion			1
the @entity180 services had indeed warned president @entity181 that @entity183 's arsenal could not attack @entity184 within 45 minutes as @entity185 claimed before the @entity22 parliament			2
in a now historical speech at the @entity21 , on february 14 , 2003 , the then @entity4 prime minister @entity187 outlined @entity4 's position			0
although applauded by the wider world community , @entity4 's statement was attacked by @entity2 @entity192 with a violence that both astounded and saddened @entity4 opinion			1
today , @entity4 is not more hawkish than in 2003			0
however , the shadow of the allies ' painful rift may have played a part in president @entity34 's current determination			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity4 is ready to join the @entity2 in a military strike , writes @entity202
since @entity22 voted against the intervention , @entity2 and @entity4 have grown closer , she says
despite 68 % of the @entity4 opposing the strike , @entity4 president @entity209 stands his ground
as @entity2 president @entity35 awaits congress ' approval , @entity4 is left waiting too
