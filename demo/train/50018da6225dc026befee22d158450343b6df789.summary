-- @entity1 does n't have " any complaints " about the press corps who cover the @entity7 -- but the associate justice could do without " incredibly snarky " columnists			1
" some of the columns that are written , you know , are another story , " @entity1 said , in a rare public lecture on @entity10 history and law presented by the @entity12 on saturday			1
" some of them are written by people who are not very knowledgeable			1
" @entity1 took particular issue with a @entity20 column critical of the cloistered culture of the @entity7			1
" i was reading one , actually , reading one this morning that was complaining about the current membership of the @entity7 , because unlike in past days , according to this columnist , we do n't have a representation of drunks , philanderers , and a few , you know , a few other n'er do wells			2
" the column - entitled " @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity34 , @entity34 , @entity35 " - argues " while we have gained diversity of background , we have n't gained diversity of experience " and was penned november 13 by @entity41 , a senior editor at @entity42 and regular @entity7 watcher for the past 15 years			2
" the current justices are intellectually qualified in ways we have never seen , " @entity41 wrote			2
" compared with the political operators , philanderers , and alcoholics of bygone eras , they are almost completely devoid of bad habits or scandalous secrets			2
this is , of course , not a bad thing			2
" @entity57 legal scholar and @entity59 professor @entity58 , who moderated the discussion and referred to @entity1 by his first name throughout the event , politely described the column as " interesting " , and quickly moved on to other topics			1
@entity1 was more forgiving of the regular @entity7 press corps			1
" we have a corps of journalists who are perm -- that , their full time job is to cover the @entity7			2
they 're very knowledgeable , there are probably ten or so of them			1
the @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , i 'm missing some but there are , there are -- they cover us full time			2
they are very knowledgeable and i think that their news stories about oral arguments and decisions when they come out are pretty good			1
" but he could n't resist at least one jab			2
" one of the interesting aspects of my job is that every once in a while we have a chance to compare notes with judges from other supreme courts or constitutional courts in other countries			0
and we had a visit a few years ago by justices from the @entity102 @entity7			0
they , they told us that they do not have journalists like that , " @entity1 said			1
watch : @entity7 justices imagined as dogs " because there journalists were , the people who wrote opinions about their decisions cover lots of other things , they , they did n't think that they were that knowledgable			1
so they devised this procedure that 's called either a lock up or a lock down , i 've forgotten which one			0
they will invite the journalists who may be interested in the , in a decision that 's coming down to go into a little room just before the opinion is announced			0
and before they go in they take away all their electronic communications devices and then they lock the door and someone on the staff of the @entity7 explains the decision to these , these journalists			0
and when they told me this story , they told us this story , i thought it was a really good idea			0
until i heard that at the end of this process , they open the door and they actually let them out			0
" the @entity142 crowd laughed heartily			0
" that 's a joke , that 's a joke , " @entity1 interjected			1
" that will make the papers tomorrow , " said the moderator			0
@entity1 , at ease and clearly comfortable in the free flowing discussion , made few controversial remarks - unless you 're @entity102			1
" it has occurred to me that we @entity57 judges have the most boring robes of any judiciary anywhere in the world			0
believe it or not - there 's a website for everything - there 's a website , you can check this , " @entity1 said			1
" if you have nothing else to do , you can compare and we are , we are the plainest , just the plain black robes , " @entity1 continued			1
" everywhere else they have colors , they have fur , they have medals			0
the @entity176 ... to me , their robes look like they 're dressed up like @entity177			0
have you seen them ? they have red robes and they have white fur around			0
" indeed , a cursory but by no means exhaustive investigation by @entity0 returned a website - www.jjmccullough.com -- on which judicial robes of the world , including those seemingly inspired by @entity188 , were featured			0
@entity1 - who perhaps is best known to the public as the justice who mouthed the words " not true " as president @entity194 criticized the @entity196 decision during the @entity197 - need not worry about any blowback from his public comments			1
@entity7 justices are appointed for life			0
" i think life tenure is a great idea , " @entity1 joked at the opening of the law lecture			1
" i think the reason is that we have the oldest constitution in the world and in the late 18th century they counted on biology taking care of the problem			0
