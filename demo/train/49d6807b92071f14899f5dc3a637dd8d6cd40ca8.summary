@entity0 -- " this should n't be happening " -- these were the words of a visibly nervous and frustrated sheriff of the court as he rang the outside bell and knocked at the gate belonging to a woman still considered by many in @entity10 as the " mother of the nation			1
" @entity13 and two other officials arrived at @entity16 's house in @entity17 on tuesday to execute a court order granting a @entity0 school permission to auction her belongings and pay an old debt			1
among the goods meant to go under the hammer were 50 paintings , a round table , chairs and a silver tea set			0
the problems started when the ex-wife of @entity30 , the country 's first black president and an international icon , registered her great niece , @entity34 , as a boarding student at @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity0 , according to court papers filed in 2008			1
the accommodation fees for the year were 40,000 @entity10 rand -- the equivalent of about $ 4,000 today			1
@entity16 , 76 , who earns an annual salary of around $ 90,000 , as a member of parliament , was given six months to pay the full amount			1
it 's unclear why she and not the girl 's own parents enrolled her into the private school			2
despite the documents stipulating that @entity51 , 000 ( $ 1000 ) be paid up front , lawyers representing the school say mrs @entity16 never paid a cent			1
they started instituting proceedings against her in october 2008			0
the case dragged on for five years			0
a lawyer acting on behalf of the school told @entity1 mrs @entity16 made her first payment last year but that she still owes nearly $ 5,000 with interest included			1
mrs @entity16 's lawyer is disputing the interest amount			1
with dozens of journalists surrounding him , not a single bidder in sight , and mrs @entity16 's bodyguards stationed on the other side of the wall , sheriff @entity13 knocked in vain			1
people could be seen moving around inside and outside the house , but nobody came out to let the sheriff in			0
at one point a car sped out of the premises using a side entrance			0
it is unclear who was in the car			0
@entity13 was instructed by lawyers to get a locksmith and force his way into @entity30 's house , but he was understandably reluctant			1
at one point a spectator shouted , " why do n't you climb over the wall ? " the sheriff 's irritated retort : " and get shot at ? " the tense standoff lasted for about two hours			0
@entity13 left @entity16 's property empty - handed and dejected			1
he later admitted that the task he was expected to carry out was a difficult one			0
" is it because she is the mother of the nation ? " he was asked			2
" exactly , " he responded			0

" mrs. @entity16 has given me a check for @entity102 , 000 ( $ 1,696 ) , and another @entity103 , 000 ( $ 212 ) has been given to the sheriff , " he told @entity1			2
" the auction is not necessary			0
" the school 's lawyers insisted on getting the money in cash , failing which , they said the sale of her goods would go ahead as planned			2
confused neighbors looked on as the spectacle at @entity30 's property unfolded			1
" we thought she had money , it is very surprising that her goods are now having to be auctioned in order to recoup funds for a debt , " one of them told @entity1			0
when asked what it is like to live next door " the mother of the nation , " the neighbor said , " we never see her			2
when the old man ( @entity30 ) lived in @entity17 he would walk around , shake people 's hands , greet and talk to them , he even invited us into his home			2
" " @entity16 keeps to herself , but we still call her ' mother of the nation ' and no - one wants to see her humiliated , " the neighbor said			1
commentators say @entity16 has become increasingly isolated , not only by her political family , the ruling @entity141 , but seemingly by her biological family as well			1
" @entity145 tensions within the family could have played a role in no one coming to mrs @entity16 's aid , " political analyst @entity143 told @entity1			1
" the family is fragmented and recent squabbles over money have further emphasized these divisions			2
" two of @entity30 's daughters -- @entity154 and @entity155 -- are currently embroiled in a legal battle over the former political prisoner 's money			1
they have filed court papers in an attempt to remove @entity30 's longtime lawyer and friend , 84 - year - old @entity164 , and others as directors of companies owned by the @entity168			1
the children 's legal battle over their iconic father 's monies has come under heavy criticism in @entity10			1
@entity164 told local media the lawsuit is " a ploy to resuscitate the sale of @entity30 's artworks " whose proceeds go to the companies at the center of the dispute			1
@entity183 , who was incarcerated on @entity184 with mr @entity30 , told @entity1 : " this is a matter that should have been resolved internally within the family			2
" @entity154 recently rebutted accusations that her intentions are motivated by greed , telling the @entity190 : " this issue that we are greedy , that we are wanting this money before my dad passes away is all nonsense			0
" the feud over @entity30 's millions and now the threat of an auction at his former wife 's residence underscore the contradictions and complexities in what many consider @entity10 's political " royal family			1
" read this : big brands target @entity10 's middle class this is by no means @entity16 's first brush with the law , although for years many saw her as untouchable			1
the former freedom fighter was implicated in the 1980s murder of 14 - year - old anti-apartheid activist @entity216			0
her then - husband , @entity30 , stood by her , despite a mountain of damning evidence			2

in recent years , " the mother of the nation 's " influence in the country and within the ruling party has waned , and the protection she once enjoyed along with it			2
last year she was voted second - last in the party 's national executive committee			0
she had been top of the list at the previous @entity141 conference in 2007			0
still , respected columnist and journalist @entity253 says he is astonished @entity16 could n't get help from a single one of her former comrades			0
@entity253 told @entity1 : " it 's great that she was paying for her great niece 's school fees but i 'm surprised that firstly she did n't feel she could raise the money from her own salary and secondly that no - one in the @entity141 was willing to help her			1
she could have also approached the @entity168			0
@entity30 has given money to president @entity263 before when he was in trouble			2
" perhaps the most astonishing part of the tale is why her children and grandchildren appear to have stood by and watched as threats of an auction became more serious			0
two of her grandchildren , @entity273 and @entity274 have recently launched a reality show in the @entity276 called " being @entity30			0
