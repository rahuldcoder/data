-- @entity1 used to think he led a comfortable middle - class existence that included a car and a home in a subdivision in @entity6 , @entity7			1
but then he lost his job and felt himself slipping into the have - not corner			0
he , like a majority of @entity11 who responded to a new survey issued wednesday , believes the gap between @entity11 's rich and poor is getting wider			1
he is n't resentful of people who sleep in mansions and drive swank cars , but he is angry at a system that he says allows the greedy to take advantage of people			0
" i am not angry at rich people , " said @entity1 , 51			0
" i am angry at the people who manipulate the system			0
" @entity11 's top 1 % of the population saw their incomes skyrocket by 275 % between 1979 and 2007 , according to the @entity28 , creating a disparity that is foremost in people 's minds			1
conflict between rich and poor is at an all - time high , at least in the way of public perception , a new @entity36 poll shows			1
the survey found that 66 % of adults believe there are " very strong " or " strong " conflicts between the two groups			1
that number spiked 19 percentage points since @entity36 last posed that question in 2009			1
" as a result , in the public 's evaluations of divisions within @entity11 society , conflicts between rich and poor now rank ahead of three other potential sources of group tension -- between immigrants and the native born ; between blacks and whites ; and between young and old , " the survey said			1
author @entity58 said he was surprised by the magnitude of change and by the uniformity of it			1
it was n't just a bunch of young liberals saying it , @entity63 said			0
old and young , rich and poor , liberal and conservative alike agreed that tensions were running high between the social classes			0
" that tells us something is very different about the social landscape , " he said			0
however , the poll did find that younger adults , @entity76 and african - americans are somewhat more likely than older people , republicans , whites or @entity81 to note strong conflict between rich and poor			1
for example , among @entity76 in the @entity36 survey , 73 % responded that class conflicts were serious ; among @entity79 , 55 %			1
obviously , @entity63 said , the downturn in the economy has been a driving force behind public perceptions			1
then there was the spread of the @entity93 movement and the media attention to economic issues			1
" these data suggest that it may have left its mark , " he said			0
but that does n't necessarily mean the poor are piling on grievances toward the rich			0
nor is there growing support for government intervention to close the gap			0
" in fact , other questions in the survey show that some key attitudes toward the wealthy have remained largely unchanged , " the @entity36 poll said			1
" for example , there has been no change in views about whether the rich became wealthy through personal effort or because they were fortunate enough to be from wealthy families or have the right connections			2
" in the survey , 46 % said they believe that most rich people " are wealthy mainly because they know the right people or were born into wealthy families			1
" almost as many , 43 % , said people were rich because of their own hard work , ambition or education , not much different than the 2008 results			2
@entity131 of @entity132 , @entity133 , is only 16 but she is keenly aware of public perceptions			0
" i think there definitely is much stronger conflict than there ever was before , " she said			2
" i live in a suburb of @entity139 that is very wealthy			2
" for one , she said , people who are wealthy tell her they are not willing to be taxed on their hard - earned money to help the poor			2
" somehow , " @entity131 said , " they think that they are better			0
' @entity145 , executive director of the @entity146 in @entity147 , senses a greater climate of fear and anxiety among the 275 families his program helps in the way of food			0
" it feels like class tensions are rising , " he said			2
" i see it when i look at how those in power act in terms of resources			0
those resources are allocated less and less to those who do n't have			0
" i think there is a general perception that overall , those who have the most have gained it at the expense of those who have the least by paying the least wages possible , by being greedy , " @entity145 said			2
discussion of class conflict reminds @entity145 of the comic strip " @entity174 " when it dealt with the topic of the war on poverty			1
" i 'm winning , " the king replies			0
" those who have the most are winning , and they intend to keep it that way , " @entity145 said			0
" that 's the general sense of the way things are in @entity11			2
" @entity36 surveyed 2,048 adults			1

perception of strong class conflict cuts across incomes , race and *ideology*
a new @entity36 poll found that 66 % of adults believe the conflict is " very strong " or " strong "
the economy and occupy movement have *fueled* opinion , the survey 's author says
but key attitudes toward the wealthy are largely unchanged
