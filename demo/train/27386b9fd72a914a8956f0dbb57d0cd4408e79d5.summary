the history of television is a history of insults			0
the idiot box , it 's been called			2
" " kill your television " says the bumper sticker			0
in 1961 , it was famously deemed a " vast wasteland			1
" after all , there were just three tv networks at the time			1
most major cities did n't have public television stations ( @entity16 was still years away )			2
and the @entity18 band , where independent stations would later flourish , was barely used			0
the first communications satellite did n't go up until 1962			2
and the content ? with few exceptions , the networks carried mostly dumbed - down , formulaic cop shows , westerns , situation comedies and musical - variety programs			1
news was something people got from newspapers			0
" it was a very limited choice , " says @entity32 , the former @entity33 chairman who coined the " vast wasteland " phrase in his 1961 speech to the @entity37 and has heard it repeated regularly over the last five decades			1
times have changed , right ? actually , yes , says tv critic @entity41			1
of the many flaws of ' 60s entertainment tv , he says , a major one was that it did n't reflect what was going on in @entity47 , whether it was the civil rights movement or the escalation of the @entity50			1
" back then , there was a lot of tv that was created by producers who really underestimated the audience , " @entity41 says			1
new day : 5 things @entity56 misses about ' @entity53 ( including : no @entity58 ) as the decade continued , television gingerly addressed some social change but certainly nothing like what was to come -- first in the 1970s with such @entity65 sitcoms as " @entity66 " and " @entity67 " and in more recent years , novelistic shows such as " @entity69			1
" tv : the new , new golden age in fact , @entity41 says even today 's widely popular sitcoms and dramas , such as " parenthood , " engage with real life in ways that were forbidden 50 years ago			1
that 's true even with " @entity79 , " an end - of - the - world horror show about zombies			1
" what it 's really about is man 's inhumanity to man , and when something happens and all the chips are down , how do you respond as a human being ? " he says , referring to " @entity79			2
" " when you think about what 's going on in @entity94 or the @entity95 or @entity96 , that 's real life			2
" moreover , even the more formulaic shows do n't take their viewers for granted			1
" i do n't think any of those shows pander to their audience in the way that a show like ' @entity107 ' or ' @entity108 ' did , " he says			1
" those were classic comedies , but they were really , really simple			0
a show like ' @entity112 ' is absolutely about all these issues we 're struggling with as a society			0
" ironically , @entity32 's 1961 speech was somewhat taken out of context			1
he actually praised the medium before lowering the boom : " when television is good , nothing -- not the theater , not the magazines or newspapers -- nothing is better , " he said			0
his concern that @entity70 was n't properly serving the public is what prompted his criticism			2
indeed , the speech was titled " @entity70 in the @entity130			0
" the last half - century has been mostly positive , says @entity32 today -- and he observes that the federal government played a positive role in that growth			1
@entity32 , now 88 and an attorney in @entity135 , was instrumental in requiring television sets to include a @entity18 dial and promoting the use of communications satellites			1
" i felt that the basic role of the government was to expand choice , because the government should not be in the business of deciding what 's on the air , " he says			2
" i think the expansion of choice was the government 's main contribution			2
" he does have some concerns , however , about the increasing consolidation of the communications industry over the last 50 years			0
" i think the idea of having local ownership has pretty much disappeared , " he says			0
but he shrugs , " the horse is out of the barn			0
" massive mergers planned for tv providers @entity41 notes , however , that despite the corporatization of media , there 's still a much broader range than in the ' 60s -- or even in the ' 90s			1
after all , 50 years ago we had three networks			0
now there 's cable , the @entity167 is a major player allowing for video streaming , and technology lets anybody " broadcast themselves , " to borrow @entity176 's old slogan			0
they can choose when to watch , too			0
yes , tv is still belittled			0
but the argument flows both ways			0
after his speech , @entity32 was tweaked by " @entity108 " producer @entity181 , who made the @entity33 chairman the namesake of a certain shipwrecked boat			1
" i told him i considered it a great compliment , " he says			0
" it exposed my name to two generations of television viewers			0

in 1961 , @entity33 chairman @entity32 deemed tv a " vast wasteland "
back then , there were three networks and a lot of dumbed - down content
today , tv critic @entity41 says things have changed for the better
even today 's formulaic shows do n't pander to audience the way ' 60s shows did , he says
