-- @entity2 through this month 's @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , there was a bright and glorious full moon that lit the night sky high above the @entity8			1
down below , men and women from around the world competed for medals on behalf of their countries			2
as usual , special attention was paid to the contests between @entity17 and @entity5 athletes			1
on sunday the closing ceremonies in @entity4 will lower the curtain on the @entity3			1
the ceremonies , as is tradition , are expected to center on two themes : competition , and the common ground that exists between different nations			2
the view of that full moon during the @entity27 , though -- so far away from the sights and sounds of the athletic contests -- brought to mind an era , not so very long ago , when competition between the @entity17 and what was then called the @entity34 was a much more serious game than anything played out on ice rinks or ski slopes			1
there were two quotes that galvanized the world back then , two quotes that set the urgent game in motion			2
the first was from @entity34 leader @entity45			1
he spoke the words in 1958 , directed at @entity48 nations and their capitalistic way of life			0
translated from the @entity5 language , the words appeared in banner headlines in big cities and small towns across the @entity17 : " we will bury you			1
" in an @entity17 already on edge during the stare - down atmosphere of the @entity61 , it is difficult to imagine @entity45 's warning being any more unequivocal than that			1
the second quote was from president @entity65 , delivered in 1962 at @entity66			2
even now , the concise confidence of his pledge , the contrast in tone from what @entity45 had said , is stunning : " we choose to go to the moon			1
that impossible thing -- that thing no one had ever done , that thing that all but defied dreams			0
and , in case anyone missed the extent of his determination , @entity65 explained why the @entity17 was going to attempt such feats : " not because they are easy , but because they are hard ... because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept , one we are unwilling to postpone , and one which we intend to win			1
" talk about high stakes			0
the @entity17 had been woefully behind the @entity34 in the space race			1
now the president was promising to go to the moon , not just someday , but " in this decade			0
" it still seems almost beyond belief , except that it happened			0
the race into space that followed those two famous declarations -- " we will bury you " and " we choose to go to the moon " -- mesmerized the nation in ways difficult to describe for those who were not born in those years			1
there was one day in particular , early in the effort , when the @entity17 was still trying to catch up with the @entity34 and put a man into @entity8 's orbit			1
it was in 1962 at @entity111 , @entity112			0
@entity113 , reporting for the @entity115 television network , was doing his best to be dispassionate and objective as the giant @entity118 rocket , with an @entity17 inside the tiny capsule atop it , thundered fearsomely into the skies			2
" flight seems to be on target so far , " @entity113 said			0
" looks like a good flight			0
" and then the emotion of it all , the importance of the contest at hand , overtook him			0
if it is possible for a baritone voice to keen , that 's what it sounded like : so unexpected and so right , a proud and almost prayerful keening as the rocket lifted : " oh , go , baby ! " then , not long after , a disembodied voice from beyond where anyone could see , the voice of the man alone in the capsule , @entity140 , telling a waiting world that he was in orbit and had achieved weightlessness , that he was free of the @entity8 's gravity			0
the sound of that faraway voice on that day , the flat @entity151 cadence , no more tense or jittery than if he were back in his hometown of @entity154 , @entity155 , ordering a cheeseburger and a milkshake at the corner hangout : " @entity159 , and i feel fine			0
" the @entity17 would win the contest ; @entity65 was dead before the end of that decade , but , just as he had vowed , @entity17 walked on the moon by the time the 1970s commenced			1
there have been only 12 people in the history of humankind who have stepped onto the moon			0
the @entity34 never made it			2
was it worth the effort ? have the fruits of the victory meant much , in the long run ? those are questions for each @entity17 to decide for himself or herself			2
this month athletes from the @entity17 and @entity5 have engaged in spirited and friendly competition at the @entity180			1
no one was threatening to bury the losers of the contests			0
it is @entity45 himself who is now buried ; he has been gone since 1971			2
today , in space , @entity5 cosmonauts and @entity17 astronauts circle the @entity8 in harmony together , traveling aboard the @entity190			1
a different world in which we all live			0
the old race -- the race to conquer space , that deadly earnest competition -- is consigned to history			1
on sunday , two weeks of beautiful and immeasurably less momentous games will come to a close at a stadium in @entity5			0
and above those games this month , there was that moon			0
a reminder of a time when , in ways sometimes difficult to recall , anything at all seemed somehow possible			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity209 says @entity27 *thankfully* did *n't* echo 1960s competition between *superpowers*
he says when @entity34 , @entity17 competed in space race , the goal galvanized @entity17
he says they saw @entity65 's moon goal as *repudiation* of @entity45 's " bury you " remark
@entity209 : @entity17 got there first ; today , there 's no race , just friendly competition , like in @entity4
