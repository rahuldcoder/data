-- the issue of human trafficking has exploded into the headlines in recent years			1
state and federal legislation has been passed helping to define trafficking more specifically and prosecute traffickers , while services enabling victims to lead productive lives , safely beyond the reach of their traffickers , have been proliferating			1
meanwhile , anti-trafficking organizations are using technology in exciting new ways to find and rescue victims and provide network linkages to prosecute their traffickers successfully			2
yet while such progress is welcome , many groups are only just beginning to focus on a crucial element of beating human trafficking -- cutting demand			1
after all , less demand means fewer trafficked victims			1
sadly , human trafficking is a multibillion dollar global industry , with some estimates suggesting more than 21 million people are enslaved worldwide			1
here in the @entity30 , between 100,000 to 300,000 @entity30 children are at risk of being trafficked each year , according to the @entity32 , with the average age of a child first being trafficked just 13			1
of course , while a trafficker can sell drugs or a gun once , sex with a child can be sold over and over again			0
it is hardly surprising then that there is also increasing evidence that many of the trafficking networks are interconnected with gang activity and drug and gun trafficking			2
a child can not choose to sell sex for money			0
a minor being sold for sex is by definition being trafficked			2
there is no such thing as a child prostitute , only a sex - trafficked victim			2
thankfully , there is a much needed mindset shift taking place among law enforcement and treatment providers , a change being increasingly embraced by those trained to recognize trafficked victims , but which needs to be accepted by the global community for continued change			1
in addition , more training is needed to identify human trafficking victims			1
law enforcement , first responders , emergency room personnel , pediatricians , school personnel , foster care administrators , child welfare personnel , court - appointed advocates , hotel , airport and taxi staff -- many of whom come into contact with trafficked children without knowing it -- could all benefit from extra training			1
increased awareness and proper protocols can help to identify correctly and get appropriate help to trafficked victims faster			1
many of these victims find themselves in the social service system , where opportunities exist to get them the help they need if they can be correctly identified			2
too often , survivors recount how they crossed paths with adults who could have helped them escape but who did n't see the situation clearly enough to offer them assistance			0
in the @entity30 , @entity104 , a joint sting operation between the @entity106 , @entity30 @entity107 and the @entity108 , has recovered more than 3,500 minors since 2003			1
the @entity111 program recovered 168 victims this summer and arrested 281 pimps			2
overseas , however , we have watched helplessly as @entity115 has kidnapped hundreds of @entity117 schoolgirls with the stated intent to sell them for sex			0
four months later , and the international community has been unable to rescue them			0
the individual stories i 've personally heard from trafficking survivors are heart - wrenching , yet it still happens every day in our country and around the world			0
sometimes , one victim at a time , sometimes in large groups			0
survivors ' stories tell us that some victims are sold into trafficking by family members , some lured by attention and promises of glamour by an " older boyfriend , " only to be abused , branded and sold for sex ; labor trafficking victims are often promised high - paying jobs far away from home , only to have their documents taken , their lives and families threatened and horrid working conditions waiting for them with no opportunity for escape			1
runaways are often picked up by traffickers within 48 hours of running away from home , and no one is looking to find them			0
the common thread is that traffickers prey on society 's most vulnerable			0
so what can we do ? more than anything , it 's up to us to do everything we can to protect our vulnerable citizens and continue this fight to make our communities and ultimately our world safer			0
it 's up to us to be a voice for the voiceless			0
while we may not yet have a clear strategy for tackling @entity115 , we can still be aware of the signs of trafficking and speak up in our communities when we see something that just does n't look right			0
a shift in mindset about the definition of a trafficked victim , stronger legislation allowing better identification and services for victims and more vigorous prosecutions of traffickers offer a healthy start			2
but we have a long way to go -- there is more to do on all these fronts .			0
