-- i finally said goodbye to some old buddies			2
@entity4 ( played by @entity5 ) , " @entity8 's " legendary stickup artist , hunts for a rival with his shotgun			1
one of them shot a woman at point - blank range after complimenting her on her hair			2
another person maimed a rival with his shotgun			2
a third stole from his sister to finance his drug habit			2
their names are as twisted as their deeds : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23			2
and if i ever introduced you to them , you probably would n't be able to understand them			2
their talk is filled with a bruising street poetry that 's hard to decipher unless you 've lived in their @entity32 neighborhood -- as i once did			1
my " friends " are some of my favorite characters on the @entity36 series , " the wire			1
" @entity36 ( which , like @entity0 , is a @entity39 division ) released the complete , five - season box set two weeks ago			1
the show focuses on a detective unit 's quest to take down a ruthless drug crew , but it grapples with bigger themes : the collapse of public schools , the disintegration of working - class @entity47 and political corruption			1
critics say " @entity8 " offers the most realistic depiction of @entity47 's inner - city subculture ever seen			1
i decided to test that claim because i grew up in the @entity32 community where " @entity8 " is set			1
after watching all five seasons , my take on the show is ambivalent			1
some of " @entity8 " is real , but not in the ways you might expect			1
' how do i get from here to the rest of the world ? ' " @entity8 's " most unsettling scene for me took place in season four			1
it involved a murder -- of a gentle teenager 's spirit			1
the character 's name is @entity23 , and he brought back memories of some people i knew			1
he has no family , his public school is paralyzed by violence and he 's not tough enough to make it on the streets			1
he has a gift for computers but does n't know what to do with his ability			2
@entity23 looks one day for help from " @entity84 , " an ex-con who runs a boxing gym in their neighborhood			2
@entity84 tells @entity23 that " the world is bigger " than the violent neighborhood both live in			2
" how do i get from here to the rest of the world ? " @entity23 asks @entity84			2
" i wish i knew , " @entity84 sighs , and walks away			0
why did @entity84 give @entity23 such a hopeless answer ? maybe it 's because some people who never lived in a neighborhood like " @entity8 " confuse hopelessness for authenticity			1
yeah , i could shock you with stories of violence , but it 's so easy to slip from revelation to titillation			2
i start off telling you a story about how tough my school was , and soon i 'm shooting it out with five drug dealers who want to steal my homework			0
but i never remember @entity32 being so hopeless			1
a man like @entity84 would n't tell a young man that he had no way out -- adults rallied around kids with potential			0
i even checked with some childhood friends -- one who is now an undercover police officer who literally works a " wire " for the @entity120 -- and we all agreed that " @entity8 's " bleakness was exaggerated			1
" they made it seem like we grew up in @entity126 , " my friend , another " @entity8 " fan , told me			1
perhaps i had the luck of timing , or , to paraphrase one " wire " character , i left just before " the game got more fierce			0
i grew up on a street connecting two notorious @entity32 landmarks -- @entity135 and @entity136			1
@entity137 is a school so bleak that @entity139 recently aired a documentary on its dismal state			0
@entity135 is known for its liquor stories and shootings			0
i left my neighborhood for good in the 1980s before crack cocaine really hit			2
still , i shared some of the same struggles as some " @entity8 " characters			1
i spent much of my childhood in the equivalent of foster homes			0
i never really knew my mother			0
my father was an on - and - off - again presence			0
but my community was filled with what @entity156 calls the " quiet heroes			0
" ( @entity156 reportedly is a big fan of " @entity8			1
" ) there was my high school tennis coach			0
the dignified deacons in my church			0
the retired steelworker who watched @entity165 baseball games on his porch next door			0
relatives , teachers , even summer job programs ( one gave me my first exposure to journalism ) -- all inspired me			0
yet those quiet heroes seem fated to fail in " @entity8			1
" the show implies that only a fantastic few ever escape the streets			2
what @entity84 could have told @entity178 despite my misgivings , i love " the wire			0
" the dialogue crackles , the characters are rich and the minute ways it captures how @entity184 move and talk is uncanny			1
but the " @entity187 " story is n't the whole story			0
" @entity8 " did , however , nail one childhood memory for me			1
the most realistic moment in " @entity8 " for me did n't take place during any violent showdown			1
it took place in a steakhouse			0
the scene involved a " @entity8 " character called " @entity198 , a major in the @entity120			1
@entity198 helps run an experimental program for problem students at a local high school			0
one night , he decides to take three of a school 's most disruptive students to a steakhouse in downtown @entity32			1
the kids are loud and brash , but they 're petrified when they have to sit down in a fancy restaurant filled with white people			0
they ca n't function and end up leaving the restaurant , still hungry and angry			0
when i was asked in high school to join an academic team that would compete on television against elite , white high schools in @entity32 , i said no. when i attended my first year in college , i would n't speak in class and stopped going because i was so intimidated being around people who could actually speak proper @entity215			1
i felt like an imposter			0
sometimes , it 's not enough to give kids who come from a world like " @entity8 " the chance to get out			1
they also have to be convinced that they deserve it			0
i almost sabotaged myself because i wanted to go back to what was familiar			0
even though the familiar was depressing , it was all i knew			0
now i know something different because a lot of people convinced me that i deserved to be in that other world			0
i wish @entity84 would have done the same for @entity23			0
i wish he would have told him he would find a way from " here to the rest of the world			0
" i hope the real - life @entity233 know that			2
they deserve a chance to say goodbye to that world , too .			0

@entity36 's " @entity8 " is *praised* for realism , but how real is it ?
@entity0 ***writer*** who grew up in " @entity8 's " @entity32 neighborhood renders *verdict*
***writer*** says show confuses " hopelessness with authenticity "
but dialogue crackles , the characters are rich , ***writer*** says
