that information was included in a " personal and confidential " e-mail he sent to the two prosecutors , @entity11 said			1
" since i 'm the only one who communicated that , it more or less would have to be that one of the two prosecutors would be their source , " he said			2

a spokesman for the @entity0 city attorney declined to comment , and the @entity16 prosecutor was in court and unavailable to respond			2
