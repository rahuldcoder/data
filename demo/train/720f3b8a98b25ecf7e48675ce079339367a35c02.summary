-- staff sgt. @entity1 served in @entity2 for nearly three years			1
like his fellow soldiers , he longed for a sense of normalcy during his tours			2
" we 'd spend hours not sleeping , and rushing to eat meals , and staying on guard , " said @entity1 , 26			0
when a litter of puppies was born on the base where @entity1 served , the animals provided just the relief he needed			0
" you walk in , and the dogs are wagging their tails , jumping on your legs and so excited to see you , " @entity1 said			2
" you forget that you 're halfway across the world , in a desert , with hostile things going on			0
" the soldiers began feeding , bathing and caring for the puppies , and @entity1 bonded with one in particular			2
" she was sleeping on her back , with her mouth wide open , her tongue out a little bit and it was such a dopey thing to do -- and it 's just like me , " said @entity1 , who named the dog @entity26			2
" so i kind of knew that was it for me			0
" but a few months later , the soldiers ' tour was coming to an end			2
determined not to leave the dogs behind , they searched for a way to get them to @entity41			0
that 's when @entity1 was connected with @entity43			1
since 2007 , the organization has reunited hundreds of soldiers with the stray dogs and cats they rescued while serving on the front lines			1
" on every single street corner in @entity54 you will find stray dogs , " said @entity49 , a former @entity50 sergeant who founded the nonprofit			1
" to be able to get that animal home to them , it closes the loop			0
... they do n't want to just abandon that animal			0
" soldier 's best friend @entity49 knows firsthand the bond that can form between a soldier and a dog			1
in 2006 , while on patrol in @entity2 , he and his troop encountered a dog fight			1
" we broke up that dog fight not realizing that one of those dogs was actually going to adopt me , " said @entity49 , 45			1
the dog followed @entity49 back to base			1
they became friends , and @entity49 named him @entity80 , after the town where he saved him			1
" he was just war - torn and battered , just like the town we were actually fighting over , " he said			0
for several months , @entity49 and @entity80 filled an important void in each other 's lives			1
" as the troop sergeant , i was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job			0
... but no one was doing that for me , " @entity49 said			1
" my time with this dog was a way of de-stressing , collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game			0
" after his tour ended , @entity49 went through a difficult process to get @entity80 home to @entity103			1
he realized he not only wanted to help other soldiers do the same , he wanted to do more to help @entity2			1
" one day you are fighting the @entity106 , and the next day you are home and grocery shopping , " @entity49 said			1
" when i got home , i thought , ' what am i doing here ? ' i did n't want to leave @entity2 forever			1
" today , @entity110 also works to promote animal welfare in the country			0
the group 's shelter and clinic in @entity54 are staffed by 14 @entity2 nationals , four of whom are trained veterinarians			2
the group spays / neuters street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population			1
in turn , those efforts help protect residents by having fewer rabid animals roaming the streets			0
@entity49 said his organization has the only official animal shelter in @entity2			1
the group also places rescued animals in caring homes there			0
journey to a new home @entity49 's group has reunited animals with nearly 700 service members from eight countries			2

all animals are spayed / neutered , vaccinated and micro-chipped			0
they spend two to three months at the shelter before being transported to the soldier 's home country			0
last year , @entity1 and fellow soldiers were reunited in @entity154 with the puppies for which they had cared			0
" when i pulled @entity26 out of the crate at ( the airport ) , i was just so excited			0
i was even more excited that she remembered me , " @entity1 said			0
" it kind of brought me back to coming back after a mission and having her there			0
it brought me right back to that feeling			0
" @entity80 lived with @entity49 in @entity103 for the last six years until the dog 's recent death			1
for @entity49 , he was a constant reminder of their journey			2
" my connection with @entity2 stayed alive because of @entity80 , " @entity49 said			1
" so for me , every time i look at him , it just makes me smile			0
i could never have dreamed that we 'd be doing something like this in @entity2			2
