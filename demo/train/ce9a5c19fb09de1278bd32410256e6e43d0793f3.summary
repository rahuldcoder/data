@entity0 -- first the @entity3 administration and the intelligence community said there was no program gathering @entity8 ' data			1
then they said the government was only gathering focused bits of data and only on foreign targets			0
then they admitted intelligence operatives were gathering large amounts of data but not accessing it unless a court first gave the @entity20			2
now it appears there are thousands of times each year when the data of @entity8 not suspected of having anything to do with terrorism are gathered			2
" can you understand , though , why some people might not trust what you 're saying right now about wanting ... , " a reporter asked president @entity3 last week at a @entity29 news conference			2
" no , i ca n't , " @entity3 said			1
@entity8 would be comfortable with the programs , he argued , if they knew everything about them			1
fact - checking @entity3 on @entity37 " i am comfortable that the program currently is not being abused , " the president said			1
" i 'm comfortable that if the @entity8 people examined exactly what was taking place , how it was being used , what the safeguards were , that they would say , ' you know what ? these folks are following the law and doing what they say they 're doing			1
' " but the public has learned about the @entity53 programs in such a way that every time a new revelation is served up , it undercuts what the president or the major players in the intelligence committee just said			1
here are the most glaring examples : 1			0
@entity3 : programs not being abused the president tried to assuage concerns about the programs during his august 9 news conference			1
he said he had ordered a new review of the programs , even as he suggested @entity8 would be better off if @entity53 leaker @entity37 had never let the world know about them			1
the important thing , he argued , is for @entity8 to be able to trust their government is n't abusing the information it is collecting			1
" what you 're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people 's phone calls or inappropriately reading people 's e-mails			0
what you 're hearing about is the prospect that these could be abused , " he said , adding that the special @entity80 was guarding against those abuses			0
less than a week later , the @entity86 published a blockbuster report based on more documents provided by @entity37 under the headline , " @entity53 often breaks privacy rules			1
" the documents given by @entity37 to the @entity86 suggest thousands of accidental and some intentional infractions			0
the head of the @entity80 took the unprecedented step of issuing a public statement that his barebones staff can only oversee what @entity53 provides to it			2
and the @entity99 , one of the main overseers of the @entity53 in @entity102 , was not made aware of the internal review by the @entity53 -- staffers learned of the review of privacy infractions when the @entity86 contacted them , according to the newspaper			1
lawmakers pledge hearings oversight after @entity53 broke privacy rules the @entity53 argued in a response that the infractions represent only a small fraction of the calls and data it is sifting through and they are incidental to the overall mission of preventing terrorism			1
@entity3 also noted at his news conference that a review of the programs was already under way and that @entity8 learning about the @entity53 's gathering of their data should n't have come through leaks			1
@entity3 takes questions from press 2			2
@entity3 : the programs are transparent during a combative june 16 interview with @entity131 , @entity3 dodged a question about how often the @entity80 denies @entity53 requests to subpoena and analyze the data that it collects			1
@entity136 asked if the program should be in some way transparent			0
" it is transparent , " @entity3 said			2
" that 's why we set up the @entity143 court			0
" according to thursday 's @entity86 report , the court is not given all the information about every request for surveillance			1
and @entity3 has admitted that the programs needs review to assure @entity8 they are not violating civil liberties			1
@entity3 says @entity53 programs are transparent 3			1
@entity151 : @entity8 not gathering @entity8 ' info the most obvious misstatement came from director of national intelligence @entity151 when he told sen. @entity155 at a march congressional hearing that the government is n't gathering information on @entity8			1
@entity155 , who has been a critic of the programs behind closed doors , was trying to get @entity151 on the record			0
@entity155 asked @entity151 whether the @entity53 collected " any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of @entity8 ? " @entity151 answered , " no , sir			1
" @entity155 : " it does not ? " @entity151 : " not wittingly			0
there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly			0
" the nation 's top spy later had to apologize in a letter to the @entity99			0
he admitted what he said was " erroneous			0
" he told @entity172 that what he said was the " least untruthful " answer			0
@entity151 admits error in testimony , apologizes 4			0
@entity177 : @entity53 does n't have capability to ' flip the switch ' in testimony to a @entity181 on june 18 , gen. @entity177 , the head of the @entity53 , had the following exchange with rep. @entity183 , chairman of the @entity184 and a supporter of the data mining programs : rep. @entity183 : " does the @entity53 have the ability to listen to @entity8 ' phone calls or read their e-mails under these two programs ? " gen. @entity177 : " no , we do not have that authority , " @entity183 : " does the technology exist at the @entity53 to flip a switch by some analyst to listen to @entity8 ' phone calls or read their e-mails ? " @entity177 : " no. " @entity183 : " so the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the @entity53 to flip a switch to listen to @entity8 ' phone calls or read their e-mails ? " he repeated			1
@entity177 : " that is correct			0
" it has since become clear through subsequent leaks that the government does have temporary access to large amounts of the phone calls and e-mails sent in the @entity8			2
but the distinction that allowed @entity177 to answer " no " is that analysts are supposed to obtain the ok from the @entity80 before doing so			0
that 's perhaps why he said they lacked the " authority			0
" subsequent leaks in july about a program called @entity216 printed in the @entity219 's @entity218 newspaper and in the @entity220 suggested that the @entity53 collects nearly every phone call and e-mail			2
the idea is that the intelligence community is collecting the entire " haystack " of information that it can sift through later when it has some idea what needle it needs to find			0
even if the analysts need court approval , the newer disclosures suggest the @entity53 has access to the content of communications , at least for a time			2
documents shed light on @entity8 surveillance programs @entity240 leak : @entity53 program taps all you do online 5			1
@entity177 : 50 plots thwarted @entity177 also argued several times before @entity102 that information " gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world			0
" but details of these plots have not been shared publicly			0
lawmakers who have been briefed on the plots have expressed skepticism			0
at a july 31 hearing , sen. @entity256 said by his estimation the @entity53 's data showed the data collection had not foiled " dozens or even several terrorist plots			2
" officials cite thwarted terror plots , oversight in defending surveillance			0

new report raises more concerns over @entity53 surveillance programs
@entity3 : @entity8 would be comfortable with programs if they knew all about them
@entity3 says programs not being abused ; later report says @entity53 often breaks privacy rules
court overseeing programs reportedly does n't see all documents
