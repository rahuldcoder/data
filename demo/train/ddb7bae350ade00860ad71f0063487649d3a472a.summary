@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity3 came down 20 years ago and in that time the world game has opened its arms to a tidal wave of talent from behind the former @entity8			1
@entity10 midfielder @entity9 has spent almost 15 years at the top of @entity13 football			1
here , @entity14 picks the 11 finest footballers to emerge from the old @entity16 since 1989			1
let us know what you think of our selection in the sound off box below			1
1 @entity9 ( @entity10 ) @entity9 , who has announced his retirement at the end of the season , has become mr. @entity10 in the eyes of football fans of the last 20 years			1
and this is for a country not short on talented players -- @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 to name but four			1
his breakthrough came at @entity37 , after which he signed for @entity39 ; four years later he was nothing short of inspirational for the @entity41 at @entity42			1
when @entity44 left @entity43 for @entity45 in 2001 , the @entity43 paid a staggering $ 54m for @entity9			1
it proved to be an inspired move : the midfielder , with his flowing hair , thunderbolt shot and all - action style , proved an able replacement			1
now 36 , he is one of @entity54 's finest players of the last 20 years			1
2 @entity55 ( @entity56 ) @entity56 's most famous footballer , @entity55 was known as the " @entity58 " during a 16 - year international career			1
blessed with a left foot from the gods , the audacious midfielder could dance past opponents at will and he would shoot from anywhere -- witness his goal at @entity66 1994 against @entity67 , a swirling , dipping strike from 40 yards			1
at club level , @entity55 played for both @entity45 and @entity71 and is still idolized in @entity72 for his achievements with @entity74 from 1996 until his retirement in 2001			1
@entity55 , who was a member of @entity77 's 125 top living footballers , holds the record for most goals for his country			1
3 @entity81 ( @entity82 ) @entity81 might now be considered one of the game 's great goal scorers , but things might have been very different had he not been evacuated with his family in the aftermath of the @entity89 of 1986			1
after starring for @entity90 alongside @entity91 -- and scoring a hat - trick in the @entity93 against @entity71 in the @entity94 -- @entity81 earned a move to @entity96 in 1999			1
at the @entity97 , @entity81 scored at will , so it was a big surprise that he flopped so badly after an eye - watering $ 43m move to @entity101 in 2006			1
a return to @entity96 has not revived his career , but 127 goals in 208 games from 1999 - 06 ensures his legacy is intact			1
have we missed one of your favorites out ? tell us in the @entity112 box below			1
4 @entity113 ( @entity114 ) elegance personified , @entity113 's career high point came at 1996 in a @entity114 side that would go on to lift the @entity120 trophy			1
@entity113 could play in midfield or as a " libero " and it was in the latter role that he underscored just how good he was			2
time after time , @entity113 brought the ball out of defense , echoing @entity128 's peerless ability to start attacks from the back			2
he was named @entity131 in 1996			2
one of the first notable @entity133 players to join a @entity135 club after @entity133 reunification , @entity113 signed for @entity137 from @entity138 in 1990			1
he went on to play for @entity139 before returning to help @entity140 win the 1997 @entity94			2
5 @entity141 ( @entity142 ) @entity141 was an explosive left - sided attacker and remains the finest player to emerge from @entity142 , @entity143 included			2
" the @entity151 " was not just explosive for his speed off the mark and trademark free - kicks ; he also had a short fuse and wore his heart on his sleeve			2
while playing for @entity71 , he was given a two - month ban for stomping on a referee 's foot , and his rows with coaches , including @entity157 , were legendary			2
but these only added to his reputation as a fan 's favorite at the nine clubs he played for in a 21 - year career			2
his six goals at the 1994 @entity66 gave him a share of the golden boot , and the @entity131 accolade followed later that year			2
6 @entity168 ( @entity114 ) no one swans around the pitch better than @entity168 , who , at 32 , is still @entity114 's star player			2
having impressed at @entity172 during their brilliant but ultimately fruitless 2001 - 02 season , @entity171 swooped			2
by that time , @entity168 had become the key man for the national side for his ability to control play from the middle of the park and score goals			2
he did the same for @entity171 until 2006 when @entity101 signed him on a free transfer			0
@entity168 has never replicated his international form in @entity183 , but he has been confirmed as @entity114 captain for the @entity185			0
7 @entity186 ( @entity10 ) in @entity186 , the @entity10 can lay claim to the world 's best goalkeeper			0
tall and commanding yet alert and agile , his glaring mistake at last summer 's @entity191 , which resulted in @entity72 's progressing at the @entity41 ' expense , was a rare blip in his short trophy - laden career			0
@entity196 spotted him playing for @entity197 while he was still a teenager in 2002 and two years later moneybags @entity101 spent $ 10m on him -- a fee that now looks like a bargain			1
after helping @entity101 to back - to - back @entity203 titles , @entity186 fractured his skull in 2006 , but he has returned -- headgear and all -- just as good			0
only 26 , his best years are ahead of him			1
8 @entity143 ( @entity142 ) @entity143 was always one of @entity54 's semi-hidden gems while he was plying his trade for @entity172			0
after scoring a goal every other game for @entity210 in his homeland , @entity143 made the move to @entity114 until @entity213 signed him in 2006			0
his touch , vision , movement , skill , strength and goal scoring prowess made it seem likely he would move on to a more successful club			0
and so it proved when @entity223 paid $ 44m in 2008			0
the languid @entity143 has yet to set @entity224 alight but 41 goals in 67 appearances for @entity142 speaks volumes for his class			0
9 @entity229 ( @entity230 ) is there a more delicate player in world football ? such a wonderful talent , but one capable of driving fans and doubtless teammates to distraction at times			0
@entity229 's assets are also his weaknesses -- a deft touch , two feet , dribbling ability , an elusive style and a keen eye for a pass , especially the killer one			0
but on an off day , he can be frustratingly ineffective			0
given he is now at @entity71 , though , it 's fair to say the @entity230 forward has talent			0
he showed it plenty of times for @entity251 , although he did n't find the net as often as he should have			0
tall and wiry , @entity229 came to the fore as @entity137 's creative force before the @entity256 paid $ 15m for him in 2005			0
10 @entity257 ( @entity258 ) like @entity143 , @entity257 has been a late bloomer			0
@entity257 was little known outside @entity258 in his early days but he shot to prominence in 2007 - 08 , when he was the inspiration behind @entity263 's @entity262 triumph			0
@entity257 then demonstrated his wonderful dribbling and playmaking abilities at @entity266 for a @entity258 side beaten only by eventual winners @entity269			0
the pint - sized @entity257 had been linked with moves to @entity54 's biggest clubs for a while but it was @entity251 who made the deal happen -- after much wrangling -- in 2009			0
11 @entity277 ( @entity56 ) unfortunately for @entity277 , his career will forever be tarnished by his dismissal by @entity101 for testing positive for cocaine in 2004 and his subsequent ban from the game			1
up to that point , he was a star on the ascent			0
prolific for @entity285 , @entity277 was snapped up by @entity139 in 2000 , but it took moves to @entity288 and then @entity289 for him to begin to shine			0
skillful and tricky , @entity277 's move to @entity101 in 2003 looked like a perfect move for both parties and after a difficult first season the striker was beginning to justify his $ 21.5m fee			0
then came the failed drug test			0
subsequent moves to @entity43 and @entity298 , where he has scored freely , have helped his career recover .			0

all 11 players come from former @entity16 countries from the last 20 years
the list contains mostly attacking players , with just one defender and keeper
