-- wednesday 's presidential debate might very well give @entity2 a significant boost , but the former governor still faces a difficult path			1
one of the more intriguing aspects of the 2012 election is that @entity2 might win a substantial majority among white voters while still losing the presidential election			1
regardless of the outcome of this election , the rising minority share of the electorate will force a deep rethinking of @entity17 strategy			0
back in 2008 , @entity18 won 55 % of the @entity20 white vote against 43 % for @entity21			1
it is worth noting that @entity21 increased the @entity24 share of the white vote by 2 percentage points relative to sen. @entity27 , the 2004 @entity24 presidential nominee			1
opinion : to woo @entity29 , @entity2 needs specifics at the same time , @entity21 won 95 % of the @entity33 - @entity32 vote , an increase of 7 percentage points compared with @entity27 , and 66 % of the @entity37 vote , an even more impressive increase of 13 percentage points			1
as @entity42 , editorial director of @entity43 and a @entity0 contributor , has observed , @entity21 's success among minority voters has put the @entity17 presidential nominee in a demographic bind			0
if we assume that @entity21 's support among black and @entity37 voters wo n't dramatically erode between now and november , @entity2 will have to outperform @entity18 by a substantial margin among white voters to win the presidential election			1
in light of recent @entity24 success among college - educated white women and @entity2 's relatively weak performance among noncollege - educated white voters outside of the @entity59 , this will prove challenging			1
we see some of these dynamics at play in down - ballot races			0
in recent weeks , the prospects of a number of @entity17 candidates for the @entity66 have deteriorated			0
one of the bigger disappointments for the @entity68 is the growing gap in the polls between former @entity72 rep. @entity71 , a @entity73 and @entity76 @entity75 veteran who is rightly regarded as having been one of the party 's most talented female officeholders , and rep. @entity80 , the @entity81 who now represents @entity83 's old congressional district			2
opinion : it 's immigration , stupid , say @entity37 voters in @entity87 @entity68 have long understood that @entity72 would be a tough race for them			1
though a @entity17 , the charismatic @entity90 - @entity32 prosecutor @entity89 won the state 's gubernatorial election in 2010 by a margin of just under 7 % , while @entity21 won @entity72 's electoral votes over @entity18 in 2008 by an impressive 15 - point margin			0
so what might account for the differences in how @entity89 and @entity83 have been received by @entity72 voters ? part of the story is undoubtedly the fact that the electorate in midterm races tends to be smaller and older than in presidential years , which are more favorable to @entity24 candidates			0
another part of the story , however , is that the ethnic composition of @entity72 's electorate has also changed			0
that is , @entity29 will likely represent a somewhat larger share of the electorate in 2012 than in 2010 , and it is a safe bet that this share will increase over time			0
an @entity17 such as @entity83 is by no means doomed to fare poorly among @entity37 voters			2
@entity117 , for example , attracted a large share of the @entity37 vote in @entity72 and in the @entity76 as a whole			1
yet @entity89 seems to have made deeper inroads into the @entity37 electorate than @entity83			2
@entity24 appear to be consolidating recent gains in the largest @entity37 ethnic groups , including the vitally important @entity90 - @entity32 constituency			2
the choice of @entity128 mayor @entity127 to give this year 's keynote address at the @entity130 was presumably made with this point in mind			0
a recent report by @entity134 and @entity135 of the center - left @entity136 -- " the path to 270 revisited " -- carefully documents the rising importance of @entity76 's nonwhite electorate to the outcome of presidential elections			0
opinion : @entity2 shakes up the race along with @entity145 and @entity87 , @entity72 is part of a vitally important swing region that had until recent years been @entity17 - leaning			2
@entity134 and @entity135 argue that the changing demographic composition of these states , and in particular the rising @entity37 share of the electorate , is a key reason why they have become friendlier terrain for @entity24 candidates			1
yet @entity134 and @entity135 demonstrate that this dynamic does n't apply just to the @entity157			0
in a number of so - called @entity59 states , for example , the rising @entity37 share of the electorate is occurring alongside an increase in the @entity33 - @entity32 share of the electorate			1
given the fact that the @entity33 - @entity32 electorate tends to strongly favor @entity24 candidates , there is a distinct possibility that a number of states now considered reliably @entity17 , such as @entity170 , might become competitive in the not - too - distant future			2
these larger trends raise two possibilities for future @entity17 candidates			0
one is that the @entity68 should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters			1
even as the white share of the electorate decreases , winning a larger slice of a shrinking pie is a viable strategy			2
the biggest hurdle to this strategy , however , is the cultural polarization of the white electorate			0
among younger white voters , for example , socially liberal views on issues such as same - sex marriage are quite common while older white voters , who have been a bedrock of @entity68 support , tend to embrace socially conservative views			1
reconciling these positions might prove difficult			0
leaving age differences aside , college - educated white voters tend to be less receptive to cultural populism than noncollege - educated white voters			1
although many analysts have suggested that @entity68 should embrace liberal positions on various social issues to appeal to college - educated white voters , this might endanger the party 's hold on less - educated whites			1
some attribute @entity2 's relatively poor performance among noncollege - educated white voters to a campaign message that caters more to the concerns of tax - sensitive voters than to less affluent voters			1
the second possibility , championed by former @entity215 gov. @entity214 among many others , is that @entity68 should redouble their efforts to appeal to @entity37 voters			1
this strategy is often associated with the view that @entity68 should embrace comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , a majority of whom are of @entity32 origin			2
opinion : the audacity of @entity2 's @entity230 it is not obvious , however , that this strategy would yield significant political dividends , and it would alienate voters who believe that creating a path to citizenship would undermine the credibility of future immigration enforcement efforts			2
a deeper look suggests that when you compare @entity29 with @entity20 white voters of the same income level , the edge that @entity24 have among @entity29 shrinks			1
one possibility is that @entity68 will improve their vote share among @entity29 as @entity37 households experience greater wage and income growth			1
the problem , of course , is that recent years have seen extremely modest wage and household income gains			0
and so @entity68 arguably have a strong political interest in policies that will raise wages and incomes			0
there are , of course , other factors			0
residential integration , immigrant assimilation and intermarriage could all affect the political landscape in unpredictable ways			0
but if current trends hold , @entity68 have a much greater need to expand their coalition than @entity24			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			0

@entity270 : @entity2 and @entity68 *relying* on white voters more than ever
he says their diminishing appeal in @entity33 , @entity37 *communities* is a big risk
@entity270 : growing nonwhite population could turn some red states into swing states
he says it will be hard for @entity68 to get a *higher* share of white vote or to appeal to minorities
