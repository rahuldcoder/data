-- a group of more than 100 prominent @entity2 ranging from evangelical minister @entity3 on the political left to @entity6 aide @entity5 on the right released a document thursday calling for an end to the fight club tone of the national political discourse			1
called the " @entity12 , " the document says that churches have too often " reflected the political divisions of our culture rather than the unity we have in the body of @entity19			1
" " members of @entity23 have been calling me saying ' it 's never been as bad as it is now , but we ca n't do much about it because we 're not credible to a lot of @entity29 , ' " said @entity3 , who leads the progressive group @entity21			1
" they said to the faith community , ' please help us			0
' " @entity3 said the covenant is the result of those conversations			1
it has 114 signatories from a broad swath of christian traditions , including the president of the @entity40 , the head of the @entity42 and the general superintendent of the @entity44 , a major @entity45 denomination			1
the list also includes plenty of strange political bedfellows , from conservative @entity50 leaders like @entity51 -- who led the unsuccessful fight against gay marriage in @entity54 -- to @entity55 , president of the progressive @entity56 , which is close to the @entity58 @entity6			1
" anytime you have a document with @entity3 and @entity5 signing , you 're talking about a pretty unusual situation and a pretty significant marker , " said @entity59 , an expert on religion and politics at the @entity62 in @entity63			1
" it shows that there are some issues that transcend politics and ideology			0
" quoting the @entity74 , the new covenant urges @entity2 to " put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander , together with all malice , and be kind to one another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , as @entity84 in @entity19 has forgiven you			0
" " we owe a certain responsibility to each other as believers , " said @entity5 , an influential evangelical @entity50 voice			1
" this does n't mean i have n't challenged some people 's theology			0
but the document says we 're not going to challenge each other 's motives or engage in ad hominem attacks			0
" @entity3 , who led the effort to draft the document and collect signatures for it , noted that the document comes at a time when members of @entity23 are complaining of physical threats against them because of their positions on the health care bill , which president @entity58 signed into law tuesday			2
@entity3 says he 'll start collecting signatures from more pastors and rank - and - file churchgoers in coming weeks			2
the pastor publicly feuded with conservative television host @entity111 this month after @entity111 encouraged his fans to leave churches that preach economic and social justice			0
@entity3 organized a boycott of @entity111 's show but says the timing of the covenant 's release is incidental			2
@entity5 said the document " would n't apply to @entity111 because we 're talking about the conversation in the family of believers ... @entity111 is a @entity125			2
" many @entity2 do n't consider @entity125 -- members of the @entity127 -- to be @entity2 , though @entity125 consider themselves @entity50			0
