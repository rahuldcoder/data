-- the man touted as the next savior of @entity4 swimming has arrived			0
just do n't ask him how much he knows about , well , swimming			0
sailing legend @entity5 has been named as the new president of @entity7 , tasked with the mighty mission of turning around a team criticized for its " toxic " behavior during a woeful @entity12 performance in @entity13 last year			1
while 66 - year - old @entity5 has no direct experience with professional swimming , he does know a thing or two about breaking sporting droughts			2
this , afterall , is the man who skippered " @entity22 " to victory in the 1983 @entity21 -- the first foreign team to beat the @entity24 in the 132 - year history of the race			1
he became a national hero , with the victory recognized by the @entity29 as the " greatest performance in 200 years of @entity4 sport			2
" " i 've had an association with high performance sport and high performance teams for more than 40 years and this appointment is one of the highlights of my career , " @entity5 said in a statement on friday			1
" swimming has a proud history in this country and a reputation for hard work , humility and success			0
this tradition needs to continue and be a clear focus for all athletes and coaches as we head towards @entity52 in 2016			0
" @entity5 replaces @entity53 , who resigned in june amid claims of inappropriate comments to a female staff member			1
he had held the position since october last year			0
his departure followed a string of controversies for @entity7 which is trying to rebuild both its team and its image after its worst @entity12 performance in the pool in 20 years			1
it was the first time @entity4 -- a nation renowned for its prowess in the pool -- had failed to win more than one swimming gold medal since 1992			0
an independent report pointed to a lack of leadership at the top and unacceptable behavior from athletes			0
" standards , discipline and accountabilities for the swim team at the @entity80 were too loose , " the report said , having canvassed 94 individuals and received 30 submissions			2
" there were enough culturally toxic incidents across enough team members that breached agreements ( such as getting drunk , misuse of prescription drugs , breaching curfews , deceit , bullying ) to warrant a strong , collective leadership response that included coaches , staff and the swimmers			0
no such collective action was taken			0
" it was a different story for the country 's sailing team which emerged from @entity80 as the nation 's best - performing sport with two gold medals and a silver			1
@entity5 -- himself a dual @entity104 and bronze medalist at the 1976 @entity105 -- served as the sailing team 's chairman of selectors at the @entity13 and @entity109			1
acting chair of @entity7 , @entity111 , also pointed to @entity5 's business credentials , saying : " he brings a unique mix of corporate expertise , government relations , sporting prowess and leadership of high performance teams and will be a valuable asset to the sport			1
" one year on from the @entity105 , there have been signs of improvement for @entity7 , with the team finishing sixth at the @entity126 in @entity127 earlier this month			2
now all eyes will be on @entity5 to see if he can finally return @entity4 swimming to the top of the medal podium .			2
