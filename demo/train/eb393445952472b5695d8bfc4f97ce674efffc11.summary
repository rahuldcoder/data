misogyny is so deeply rooted in @entity2 's collective psychology that even the president 's son -- in this case , @entity5 @entity4 member @entity3 -- could entangle himself with a remark against women protesting gang rape			1
he called them " dented and painted women " who go to discos , have little connection with ground realities and are making candlelight vigils fashionable			1
after an enormous backlash , he apologized and retracted his comments , but many are not satisfied and want his resignation @entity23 has long permeated our textbooks , our pedagogy and our parenting			1
in fact , it runs so deep that it reflects itself even in our linguistics			0
the @entity33 phrase most commonly used to describe sexual violence or rape against women is " izzat lootna , " which means " to steal the honor of			1
" another @entity33 word used for rape , " balatkar " ( or " bad act " ) , is considered so erudite and technical that it 's barely ever used			1
( its @entity44 equivalent would be " coitus " instead of " sex			0
" ) so , for the most part , we 're stuck with " izzat lootna " -- and the necessary question : why should a rapist be given so much credit ? rape is a criminal act of force and perverse subjugation			1
when a woman is raped , her most fundamental rights as a human being are violated			1
yet , she is just as honorable as she ever was			0
honor can not be stolen			1
it can only be surrendered			0
surely in the act of rape , it is the perpetrator , not the victim , who surrenders honor			1
the brave girl from @entity69 died with her honor intact			1
her rapists will live in ignominy			1
unfortunately , in @entity2 rape is inextricably linked by men -- and women -- to shame : the ultimate desecration			1
many victims are murdered by their rapists or choose to commit suicide			1
it is also not uncommon for the parents of rape victims to kill themselves			1
thus , most victims do n't speak up about what happened to them , lest their families be ostracized , lest they never find a husband or be shunned by their friends			0
about 10 months ago , i was offered a role of a young , urban woman who gets gang raped			1
the film explores how she chooses to deal with what happens to her			0
it is a very powerful script , and most of me wanted to accept the role immediately			0
but a gnawing part of me worried about how i 'd be perceived by the general public were i to perform this role			0
female sexuality in @entity33 cinema is extremely fraught , especially because audiences seem unable to comprehend the distinction between what a role demands from an actor and that person 's conduct offscreen			1
in the script the woman is attractive , confident and self aware ; she 'd had several consensual relationships with men and enjoyed her sexuality			1
truth be told , her character is not far from me in real life			0
still , in patriarchal , judgmental , misogynistic @entity2 society , these are labels most women are afraid to carry publicly			2
on top of this , the character gets raped			0
i was afraid to accept the role			0
afraid of whether audiences and the media would think i was promiscuous , desecrated			0
embarrassed at the prospect of saying i 'm doing a film in which i get raped , lest aspersions be cast on my character			0
there lay , in my own mind , the seeds of the same misogyny that makes mr. @entity3 's remarks in the wake of the student 's gang rape so deplorable			1
seeds i had to uproot at once			0
at the time i was offered the film , rape was n't getting the sort of national attention it is getting right now			2
it was still a topic that made most people uncomfortable , a topic that women and men alike were not able to freely express their opinions on			2
that @entity2 's young public is today demanding so vocally the need to address the way we view sexuality and gender equality is empowering			2
people are sharing their own experiences of sexual violence on blogs and social media			0
men and women are collaborating to seek legal reform , to challenge the societal perceptions they have been force - fed. we now understand that to remain silent bystanders of a crime is to collude with the criminal			1
it is clear to me that as actors , filmmakers , artists , journalists , activists -- people who use a medium that has the potential to reach so many minds -- it is our responsibility to educate and mobilize , while we entertain			0
for the last 10 months , as we have been rehearsing and shooting , the subject of rape has been my foremost preoccupation			2
two points have struck me in particular : first , the director , who is also the scriptwriter , is male			0
his co-writer , the music composer , is also male			0
these two artists , @entity192 and @entity193 , chose to champion a cause that almost always gets packaged as a women 's issue			1
in @entity2 , sexual violence is perpetrated almost entirely by men			0
should men not feel responsible then to prevent the occurrence of this crime ? should n't men be disturbed that their mothers , sisters , wives and daughters constantly feel unsafe or feel they have to dress and behave in a particular way to avoid getting raped ? is n't it time men educated other men about consent ? secondly , and this point took me longer to acknowledge , women are as guilty as men for the mindset that breeds the crime			2
we kill our own infant daughters , we immolate our sons ' wives if they bear female children , we disapprove of women who make an effort to be attractive -- and doubt their character			2
we still look at marriage as if it 's the purpose for which we were born			2
but misogyny is no longer misogyny when expressed by a woman			2
it 's self - loathing			2
and while it is easy -- and justified -- for women to point fingers at men for the chauvinism in our society , do n't we owe it to ourselves to look within ? join us on @entity240 / @entity239			0
