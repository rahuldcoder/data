the election of a new anti-austerity government in @entity3 is raising questions about how the debt - laden state will satisfy its creditors and citizens weary of cost - cutting measures			1
the leader of the left - wing @entity12 party , @entity13 , was sworn in as @entity3 's new prime minister on monday after forming a coalition with the right - wing @entity17 party			1
@entity13 has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of @entity3 's @entity21 bailout			1
since 2010 , @entity3 has received bailouts totaling 240 billion euros			2
in return , the @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 demanded tax hikes , a freeze on state pensions , bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries			2
@entity12 's pledges to try to get some of @entity3 's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate -- even if they potentially jeopardize @entity3 's place in the eurozone			1
the party 's victory could lead to a dramatic showdown with the debt - laden nation 's lenders			1
@entity12 's message is one that has also resonated in other southern @entity49 countries under the restrictions of international bailouts			2
its victory could boost other populist parties , such as @entity56 's anti-euro @entity54 in @entity57 and the @entity58 in @entity59			2
declaring victory for @entity12 on sunday after polls showed it winning at least 149 seats in the 300 - seat parliament , @entity13 , 40 , appeared to brace for a bigger battle			1
" we are regaining our lost dignity			0
... now that we are heard by all of @entity49 , we will fight with the same passion , the same confidence , " he told cheering supporters			0
" so let 's go and let 's all continue this beautiful and tough fight , " he said			0
" @entity3 leaves behind the austerity that ruined it , leaves behind the fear , leaves behind five years of humiliation , and @entity3 moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity , " he told the crowd			2
new anti-austerity government worries markets @entity25 executive board member @entity86 told @entity0 on monday that @entity3 would still have to pay its debt			1
" they have to pay ; those are the @entity49 rules of the game			0
there is no room for unilateral action in @entity49 , that does n't exclude a discussion , for example , on the rescheduling of this debt			0
but i would like to underline that it 's not the @entity25 's money -- it 's the governments ' money ; it 's a discussion between mr. @entity13 and the @entity49 governments			1
" chief @entity24 spokesman @entity106 said it respected the " sovereign choice of the @entity3 people			2
" " we are ready to engage with the new government once it is formed			0
@entity3 has made remarkable progress in recent years , and we stand ready to continue to assist @entity3 in addressing the remaining reform challenges , " he said			2
the austerity imposed by @entity3 's international creditors has cut deep			1
unemployment has soared to 28 % , and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages , pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back			0
the governing @entity125 had pointed to recent improvements in economic indicators as signs that things were getting better			0
after conceding defeat sunday , outgoing prime minister @entity130 said his conscience was clear			1
" i got a country on the verge of ruin			0
i was asked to try and save it , and i did it , " he said			0
" most people did not believe we could stand strong , but we did			0
" now , he said , @entity3 is secure and " slowly walking away from the crisis			0
" " and more than anything , " he said , " i give back a country that is a member of the @entity143 and the euro			0
" on monday , the ceo of one of @entity3 's largest banks , @entity149 , said @entity12 was coming to power at a " fortunate time			1
" " the tide is changing in @entity49 , the macro is improving in @entity3 , the @entity25 is launching an unprecedented easing , and that will have a significant bearing on the fortunes of @entity3 going forward , " @entity152 said			1
opinion : @entity12 shows the failure of ' cartel politics ' " @entity3 has already gone through massive adjustment , much of the hard work has already been completed , the green shoots of recovery are already there , so this is a great opportunity for @entity3 , a great opportunity for a new government			1
" in his victory speech sunday , @entity13 noted that @entity3 's election could have an impact far beyond his country 's borders			1
" our victory is , at the same time , it 's a victory for all the people of @entity49 that are fighting against austerity that 's ruining the common @entity49 future , " he said			0
but it 's unclear how @entity12 's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out			2
is @entity13 man of the moment ?			0
