an arrest has been made in connection with possibly contaminated letters sent to president @entity4 and sen. @entity5 , the @entity0 said wednesday			1
@entity7 was arrested by the @entity8 at his home in @entity10 , @entity11 , the department said in a statement			1
discovered tuesday , the letters were addressed to @entity5 , a @entity11 @entity14 , and to @entity4			1
the justice department release said a third letter was sent to a @entity11 justice official			1
the letters to @entity5 and @entity4 were stopped at a government mail - screening facility after initial tests indicated the presence of the deadly poison ricin			1
because initial tests can be " inconsistent , " the envelopes have been sent off for additional tests , an @entity8 statement said			1
the @entity8 does not expect to receive results from the tests until thursday , federal law enforcement sources told @entity30			1
the letters read : " to see a wrong and not expose it , is to become a silent partner to its continuance			2
" they were signed " i am @entity37 and i approve this message , " a source said			2
reports of suspicious packages and envelopes also came into two @entity43 office buildings late wednesday morning			1
@entity44 evacuated the first floor of the @entity46 for more than an hour and questioned a man in the area who had a backpack containing sealed envelopes , but the man was not taken into custody			1
" it just reminds you that with public service comes the real possibility that you could be a target , " said sen. @entity56 , @entity57			1
" but on the other side of it , we have an excellent police force , and i think they 'll get to the bottom of it			2
" what is ricin ? beyond @entity70 , suspicious letters spotted @entity71 , a judge in @entity72 , @entity11 , told @entity30 wednesday night that she received an envelope with a suspicious substance and a letter similar to the ones sent to the offices of @entity4 and @entity5			1
last wednesday , the judge received and opened a typewritten letter -- postmarked from @entity81 , without a return address -- that included " suspicious content , " @entity72 sheriff @entity78 told reporters			1
the letter had " great consistencies and similarities " to the letters sent to @entity4 and @entity5 , he said			1
investigators were testing the contents of the letter to determine whether ricin was inside , he said			1
@entity71 told @entity30 the letter originally tested negative for ricin but was being retested wednesday			1
local authorities were awaiting the test results to determine whether to file state charges , @entity78 said			2
" the letter was handled , the chemical was handled by several different individuals in our justice court system , " @entity78 said , but added that " we do not have any reason to believe that anyone 's life is in danger			2
" investigators are trying to determine whether suspicious letters found at @entity43 offices elsewhere in the country came from the same source , federal law enforcement sources said			2
sen. @entity113 , @entity114 , said one of his home - state offices received a " suspicious - looking " letter and alerted authorities			1
" we do not know yet if the mail presented a threat , " said @entity113 , the chairman of the @entity119			0
a staffer for @entity125 sen. @entity123 flagged " suspicious letters " at the freshman @entity14 's @entity127 office , @entity123 spokeswoman @entity122 said in a statement , but " no dangerous material was detected in the letters			1
" @entity133 spokesman @entity132 said the envelope contained some type of powder			0
the person who initially found the envelope is being treated at a @entity127 - area hospital for a pre-existing condition and stress from the event , and others in the immediate vicinity were examined as well			0
in a statement issued wednesday , the @entity8 said it has no indication of a connection between the tainted letters and monday 's bombings at the finish line of the @entity151			0
but the discoveries further heightened security concerns at a time when @entity155 is considering politically volatile legislation to toughen gun laws and reform the immigration system			0
@entity160 spokesman @entity159 said the president had been briefed on the letters			0
" obviously , he understands and we all understand that there are procedures in place , as the @entity8 has said			0
there are -- there is is a process in place that ensures that materials that are suspicious or substances that are found to be suspicious at remote locations are then sent for secondary and more intense testing , and that process is under way now , " @entity159 said			0
a @entity179 chiropractor 's words in the spotlight while authorities in @entity70 investigated the letters , the wife of a @entity179 chiropractor said the wording in them caught her by surprise			0
the phrase used in the letters is something chiropractor @entity193 once said and has been widely quoted online , his wife , @entity188 , told @entity30			0
on wednesday , she sounded surprised when told by @entity30 that the wording was included in the letters under scrutiny in @entity70			0
she said she was not aware of the letters and that the phrase refers to her husband 's general philosophy of care			0
she said their office phone started ringing frequently wednesday afternoon , and it was " kind of freaking out our other employee			0
" a 2006 post on a blog for @entity193 's office says the comment originally was a criticism of insurance companies			0
since then , the site says , it " has been a quote that has been picked up and quoted ( sometimes without attribution ) around the net " and " people are using it about all kinds of injustices			0
" the letter sent to @entity5 had a @entity81 , postmark and no return address , @entity43 sergeant - at - arms @entity217 wrote in an e-mail to senators and aides tuesday			1
@entity5 has been assigned a protective detail , according to a law enforcement source			1
a laboratory in @entity228 confirmed the presence of ricin on the letter addressed to @entity5 after initial field tests also indicated the poison was present , according to @entity217			1
however , the @entity8 said additional testing was needed because field and preliminary tests produce inconsistent results			1
" only a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the presence of a biological agent such as ricin , " according to the bureau			2
a law enforcement source said further tests would be conducted at the @entity246 's biomedical research laboratory at @entity247 , @entity228			2
after the arrest was announced wednesday night , @entity5 released a statement thanking " the men and women of the @entity8 and @entity252 for their professionalism and decisive action in keeping our family and staff safe from harm			1
" his offices in @entity11 and @entity70 " remain open for business to all @entity261 , " @entity5 said in the statement			1
mail for members of @entity155 and the @entity160 has been handled at offsite postal facilities since the 2001 anthrax attacks , which targeted sen. @entity267 , @entity268 , and then - majority leader @entity269 , @entity270			2
@entity43 mail service shut down senators were told tuesday that the mail facility would be temporarily shut down " to make sure they get everything squared away , " sen. @entity272 , @entity273 , said tuesday afternoon			2
" the bottom line is , the process we have in place worked , " she said			0
senate minority leader @entity282 , @entity283 , also praised the postal workers and law enforcement officers for " preventing this threat before it even reached the @entity287			0
" " they proved that the proactive measures we put in place do , in fact , work , " he said			0
ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans			2
as little as 500 micrograms -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult			0
there is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed			0
it can be produced easily and cheaply , and authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin			2
but experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction			0
@entity294 was used in the 1978 assassination of @entity319 dissident @entity318			0
the author , who had defected nine years earlier , was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while waiting for a bus in @entity324 and died four days later			0
a previous ricin scare hit the @entity287 in 2004 , when tests identified it in a letter in a @entity43 mail room that served then - majority leader @entity330 's office			1
the discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures , but no one reported any ill effects afterward , @entity330 said .			0

a @entity11 judge received a similar letter that is also being tested
@entity0 says @entity7 of @entity10 , @entity11 , has been arrested
envelopes were addressed to @entity4 and sen. @entity5 , @entity11
