-- it was a " crazy " high - stakes routine that risked everything in the pursuit of gold			1
@entity5 had linked together the three most difficult moves in the high bar discipline , but the @entity9 gymnast knew if he fluffed any one of them it would lead to humiliation on the world 's biggest sporting stage			1
the omens were not promising			2
a few short weeks before the @entity18 , as defending @entity17 champion he fell off the apparatus and finished 56th			1
but @entity5 knew that to beat the best in the world he had to persist with his plan			1
and on the afternoon of tuesday august 7 , he produced one of the most memorable moments of a games defined by its iconic sporting achievements			2
" i was really focused and not thinking about the past or the future but just of the moment , " he told @entity0 's human to @entity28			2
" the routine was going so fast but by the end of it i was getting more relaxed , and then i did the dismount -- and when i landed the dismount it was the best feeling i ever had			0
" from the moment the 26 - year - old spun off the bar to come down flush on the mat without a hint of a wobble or further movement , he knew the gold was his			1
perfect landing " it was a perfect landing so it was a really great feeling and the crowd was going wild , " he recalled			0
after a nervous two - minute wait for the score , @entity5 was confirmed in first place with a massive 16.533 points , beating @entity52 's @entity51 into silver on 16.400 with defending champion @entity54 of @entity56 third on 16.366			1
the " @entity64 " -- his rather predictable nickname -- was indeed flying high and returned home as a hero to win a string of awards -- as well being named to the @entity61 , one of the highest honors in the @entity9			1
the @entity67 clips of his performance have become a big viral online hit , and he is regularly named in polls of top performances in the @entity72			0
it 's all down to pulling off a sequence of complex moves -- named after former gymnasts			0
" the first is the cassina , you have a double somersault and then straight , and you make one turn , " he explains			0
" the second is the kovacs , a double - somersault and then tucked , with your legs , and the third one is the kolman , and it 's a double - somersault tucked with one turn			0
" @entity5 had become renowned as the only gymnast to regularly perform two of the difficult moves in succession , but to perform three had many shaking their head			1
crazy risk " a lot of people thought that i was crazy because i wanted to do it on the @entity98 , because they thought the risk was too big			0
" i think i surprised a lot of people to really do it			0
" for many , such a triumph would be the signal to bow out , but not only is @entity5 setting his sights on the next @entity98 in @entity105 in 2016 , he is also combining up to 30 hours per week training with medical studies			1
" of course it 's a hard combination			0
i have a little bit less time for other things but it 's great i can do sport at this level and get a great education , " said @entity5 , who aims to be an orthopedic doctor			1
immediate motivation comes in his desire to win his first world title after finishing second at two championships			0
" it 's the one big goal i have left , " he admitted			0
" it 's getting harder and harder to compete at this level but i think i can manage to continue until the next @entity98 when i 'm 30			0
" having started gymnastics training when he was four in the town of @entity127 , @entity5 will have been in his sport for over a quarter of a century come the next games , gradually building up the intensity of his efforts			1
in a typical four - hour session he will do 50 somersaults , and does not just confine himself just to the high or horizontal bar discipline			1
all - round ability @entity5 has won @entity17 silver on the parallel bars , and it was thanks to his ability over six events that he was even able to appear at the @entity18			1
finishing outside of the top three in the high bar at the 2011 world championships in @entity145 after a disappointing display , he was forced to qualify via the all - round competition at the @entity149 test events			1
" i was n't ready for that anymore but it was the only possibility , " he said			0
" i qualified ( beating fellow @entity9 @entity152 ) so i was very happy with that , and after that i could train on the parallel bars and high bars again			2
" it was during this period that @entity5 decided to go with his high - risk strategy , gaining the support of his coach @entity161 , who was " quite positive also from the beginning			1
his confidence increased as @entity5 appeared to perfect the routine in almost every training session			1
but performing it under the pressure of competition is another matter , and @entity5 's spectacular flop at the @entity17 championships in @entity172 set nerves on edge			1
" i knew from the training where i made it almost all the time that it was possible but the big challenge is in your head , " @entity5 said			1
" on the day of the competition i had a lot of nerves and it was quite hard to get it under control			0
" unique feat ? but he need not have worried , stunning the crowd and his rivals with his performance			2
but now he is at the summit of his sport , @entity5 knows he can not relax			2
" you realize there are a lot of talented gymnasts who can do the same as you do , so i think about my competitors who are really working hard , " he said			0
" i heard about one gymnast in the @entity9 who is also able to do it ( the triple move ) but for the rest i do n't think anybody can do it			2
" he will step up his training for the world championships in @entity206 in the first weekend of october , sacrificing the sort of lifestyle friends of his own age enjoy			2
" you do n't have so much time to go out or do things with your friends , so sometimes that 's hard but with sport at this level you have no choice			0
" fortunately , his girlfriend @entity217 , who competed at a high level in speed skating as a junior , understands the nature of top - class sports competition			2
@entity5 appears remarkably unaffected by his celebrity status in his home country as the first man to win a gymnastics @entity98 gold			1
lasting fame even his nickname has echoes of the most famous figure in @entity9 sporting history , athlete @entity233 , who won four gold medals in track and field at the @entity237 in @entity149			2
@entity233 was called " the @entity242 " and was named @entity239 female athlete of the 20th century by the world governing body			0
@entity5 has etched his own piece of @entity98 history with his stunning performance in @entity149 and set new standards in his discipline -- its impact similar to that of the perfect 10 achieved by @entity250 at the 1976 @entity251			1
in his own country , gymnastics has received a massive boost as youngsters look to emulate him			0
" it 's called the ' @entity258 , ' " his agent of five years @entity256 told @entity0			0
" he 's inspiring a generation of young people and all the clubs have had a massive boost			0
