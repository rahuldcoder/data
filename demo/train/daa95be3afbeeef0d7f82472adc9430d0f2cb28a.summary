-- three @entity2 judges surprised phone owners everywhere tuesday with a new message : you do n't have to be texting and driving to get in trouble			1
you might be legally liable for a crash if you 're on the other end of the phone , too			1
@entity2 's state @entity10 sided with the argument made by a couple who were badly injured in a 2009 crash with an 18 - year - old whose truck drifted across the center line and hit them riding on their motorcycle			1
they had already settled with the driver			0
but they 'd also sued his 17 - year - old girlfriend , who had texted him shortly before the crash			1
on appeal , the court did n't find the girlfriend liable in this particular case because she did n't appear to know her boyfriend was driving at the time			1
but the jurists accepted the general argument that a texter may bear some legal responsibility if they know the other party is behind the wheel			0
that ruling opened up a whole new front in the war on texting and driving , which has seen lawmakers across the country getting tough on phones in the hands of motorists			1
the ruling sparked a lot of questions			0
we 'll try to address some of them here			0
is it now illegal to text someone who is driving ? no , not yet			2
the criminal laws on this issue have n't changed in @entity2 or elsewhere			2
but the @entity2 judges appear to be saying that texting someone who is driving could make you liable to a civil lawsuit , based on existing laws against distracting a driver			1
" we conclude that a person sending text messages has a duty not to text someone who is driving if the texter knows , or has special reason to know , the recipient will view the text while driving , " they said in their ruling			1
" one of the great arguments my colleague made ... was that when you text -- you 're the texter -- you are electronically in that car , " @entity2 attorney @entity69 told @entity0 affiliate @entity70			1
could a new law result from this ? it 's possible			0
states everywhere are cracking down , but @entity2 lawmakers have been pretty aggressive in recent years about going after texting while driving			1
they 've already beefed up penalties to the point where causing an injury while texting is treated like doing so while driving drunk			1
a distracted driver could be fined up to $ 150,000 and could go to jail for as many as 10 years if they hurt someone , according to a law they passed last year			0
and they 're currently considering a bill that would let police officers look at a driver 's phone after an accident to see if they were texting at the time			2
gov. @entity98 , though , seems to think blaming the sender might be going too far			1
the driver , he said , is ultimately the one responsible			2
" you have the obligation to keep your eyes on the road , your hands on the wheel and pay attention to what you 're doing , " he told radio station @entity2 101.5			2
how am i supposed to know when someone is driving ? that 's question many folks have been asking			0
@entity114 , a lawyer in @entity115 , @entity2 , who handles many driving - related and personal injury cases , says that 's probably going to be at the heart of any lawsuit that tries to leapfrog off of this ruling			1
" that will be a hotly contested factual issue , " he said			0
" i could envision a situation where an exchange goes back and forth and the driver explicitly says ' i 'm driving ' and you have someone who says , ' this needs to be answered right now			2
' " @entity69 said the argument would hinge on " if the texter knows , or has a special reason to know , that the driver will look at that text and respond to it			2
" examples , he said , are employer and employee or parent and child			0
how can i stay in the clear ? this one might be a no - brainer			0
but @entity142 says there 's an easy way to avoid potential liability if you have a message for someone you know is probably on the road			0
" do n't , " he said , when asked what he would tell a client			0
" i think that 's the advice to everyone			0
simply do n't do it			0

@entity2 court says texting a driver may make you responsible for a crash
judges *suggest* a text is similar to causing an in - car distraction
attorneys : it will hard to prove sender knew the recipient was driving
@entity2 gov. @entity98 : in the end , the driver is responsible
