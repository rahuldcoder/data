@entity101 said the @entity8 " coordinated closely with @entity17 to ensure that security measures are in place and the national security of the @entity8 will not be compromised			1
" the @entity8 believes @entity2 had been held for the bulk of his captivity in @entity49 , the official said			2
it was unclear when he was moved to @entity11			0
the @entity8 government acknowledged in may 2012 that it was engaged in talks with the @entity56 to free @entity2			1
saturday 's transfer was brokered through the local @entity17 government , the official said , after talks that began about a week ago			2
@entity8 officials had said this year that one route to getting @entity2 back was through @entity17 officials , who had been talking to the @entity56			1
but @entity2 was believed to be held by operatives from the @entity187 , an insurgent force affiliated with the @entity56 and @entity189 , and it was not clear whether @entity187 operatives would abide by any agreement among the @entity8 , @entity17 and the @entity56			1
an @entity11 @entity56 commander , not authorized to speak to the media , confirmed to @entity52 that @entity2 was captured by the @entity11 @entity56 with links to the @entity187 in @entity49			1
over the years , the captive was transferred back and forth between @entity11 and @entity49			0

fast facts : @entity2 in july of that year , a @entity8 military official said the soldier was being held by the clan of warlord @entity204			1
critics question the negotiations the @entity8 has long declared that it wo n't negotiate with groups linked to terrorists , but analysts have said the @entity8 has effectively maneuvered around the edges of that declaration over the years			2
" as the administration has repeatedly affirmed , we will not transfer any detainee from @entity15 unless the threat the detainee may pose to the @entity8 can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane treatment policy , " a senior administration official told @entity52 , adding that the detainees will be " subject to restrictions on their movement and activities			1
" @entity223 sen. @entity222 , a former pow , in a statement called the released detainees " hardened terrorists who have the blood of @entity8 and countless @entity11 on their hands			2
" " i am eager to learn what precise steps are being taken to ensure that these vicious and violent @entity56 extremists never return to the fight against the @entity8 and our partners or engage in any activities that can threaten the prospects for peace and security in @entity11 , " he said			1
" the @entity8 people , and our @entity11 partners , deserve nothing less			0
" a senior administration official told @entity52 , " with regard to whether or not we 're negotiating with terrorists : sergeant @entity2 is a member of the military who was detained during the course of an armed conflict			0
the transfer of these individuals is not a concession -- it is fully in line with the president 's goal of closing the detention facility at @entity75			0
" the @entity56 had long demanded the release of five detainees at the @entity8 military prison at @entity75 , @entity149			1
but @entity8 officials said that releasing them would be difficult because @entity72 would have to be notified in advance , and lawmakers have previously resisted releasing them			0
@entity265 leaders signed off last week on @entity0 's exit strategy from @entity11 that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the @entity8 - led international military force by the end of 2014			1
@entity2 , of @entity272 , @entity120 , appeared in diminished health in a video that the @entity8 military obtained in january			0
