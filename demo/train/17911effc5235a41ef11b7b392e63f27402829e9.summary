army gen. @entity8 speaks to reporters at the @entity10 on thursday			2
" i 'm not sure we will ever see anyone declare victory in @entity7 , because first off , i 'm not sure we 'll know for 10 years or five years , " @entity11 gen. @entity8 told reporters at the @entity10			1
about 123,000 @entity3 troops are in @entity7 now , and president @entity15 says all combat forces will be gone by the end of august 2010 , leaving as many as 50,000 noncombat troops to advise and train @entity7 forces before leaving by the end of 2011			1
@entity8 has said he wants to draw down the @entity3 forces at a faster rate than planned if the security situation allows it			0
on thursday , he said he expected the number of @entity3 troops to drop to 120,000 by the end of october , and to as few as 110,000 by the end of 2009			2
" what we 've done here is we 're giving @entity7 an opportunity in the long term to be a strategic partner of the @entity3 , but more importantly , be a partner in providing regional stability inside of the @entity35 , " @entity8 said			0
@entity8 also highlighted continuing security issues inside the country , saying @entity7 security forces have recently seized several " very large " caches of @entity41 - made rockets and armor - piercing munitions known as explosively formed penetrators , or @entity43			1
" if you 're training people ... in @entity41 to come back into @entity7 , and you 're providing them rockets and other things , i call that significant because it still enables people to conduct attacks not only on @entity3 forces but on @entity7 civilians , " @entity8 said			1
