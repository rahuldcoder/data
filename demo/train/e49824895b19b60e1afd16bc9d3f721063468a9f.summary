@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the months leading up to the start of the @entity4 the story of @entity0 , the stage for one of the world 's biggest sporting extravaganzas , has evolved into a distinctly negative narrative : security threats , gay - rights protests and corruption allegations			1
security because areas such as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 -- all nations close to @entity0 's location on the north coast of the @entity20 -- have ongoing issues with @entity1 that have a history of violence			1
two recent bombings in @entity25 , and reports of suicide bombers dubbed " black widows " in operation , prompted the @entity31 government to say it viewed the @entity32 as an " attractive target for terrorists			0
" gay rights because @entity1 's government banned what it defined as " gay propaganda " in 2013 , a move that has seen widespread criticism from competing athletes and areas of the international media , and has led to some high - profile politicians refusing to attend			1
detractors argue such laws fly in the face of the @entity49 charter , which states the @entity32 , like sport itself , should be available to all , regardless of race , sex or sexual orientation and free of discrimination			2
and corruption because the @entity32 have cost more than $ 50 billion according to some sources , more than any other in history , and have been funded against a backdrop of criticism from opposition groups			2
former deputy prime minister @entity63 has complained of " embezzlement and kick backs " and questioned where $ 20 - 30 billion has been spent			2
but there is another narrative that is worthy of reflection : @entity1 's attempts to forge a new identity on the international landscape through sport , and from this point of view first impressions count			1
security without wanting to pretend to be authoritative on an area with next - to - zero expertise , anecdotally the security seems impressive			1
as with @entity82 , all entry to @entity49 venues require an airport - style security check and x-ray as well as a barcode scan of your ticket before gaining access			1
police are at all major sites in good numbers , along all major roads traveled thus far , and are supported by military personnel as well			0
vehicle searches are thorough and mandatory for entry into @entity97 ( @entity97 ) managed territories , even freeways have security atop embankments and escarpments monitoring the traffic drive past			2
the much touted " @entity106 , " on the face of it at least , is in place and high profile			1
venues my visit to @entity0 's coastal cluster awaits , but the mountain facilities witnessed so far proved awesome in the true sense of the word			1
a ski jump whose start point seems to scratch the sky such is the way that it 's perched on , and protrudes from , the mountainside ; cable cars that criss - cross spectators across the epic crevasses below ; huge seating galleries and bleachers , erected on the angled ground with a complex mesh of scaffolding and ingenuity ; slopes and slideways of the @entity134 and @entity135 ( race locations for the downhill skiing - type events and bobsleigh - type events respectively ) that carve smooth pathways down the otherwise unpredictable surfaces ; they are fantastic stages for sporting competition			1
accommodation first impressions of the accommodation has broadly not been good , an assessment which , in large part , has been formed by the unpreparedness of hotels set aside for media			0
journalists are known to be a vainglorious lot but there is a serious point here that rooms booked for large expense , months in advance , are not ready and their state was not communicated well to those affected			0
at worst this could test the claim of @entity97 president @entity162 that all but 3 % of rooms are ready			0
it raises fears of spectators who are traveling from far and wide that they could be left out in the cold			0
at best it 's something of a @entity170 disaster			2
frustrating those with the loudest mouths is an early own - goal to concede and one that @entity174 , which contended with its own doom - mongers ahead of the 2012 opening ceremony , avoided with aplomb			2
transport the " @entity186 " has had its detractors -- the joke doing the rounds is that it would have been cheaper to lay caviar as a surface than the @entity185 used			0
but the estimated $ 8.6 billion cost for less than 30 miles aside , the road -- as well as the railway that runs parallel to it -- is nothing short of an engineering marvel			1
the dual carriageway cuts a path from the pleasant climes of the coastal @entity196 through the vertiginous slopes of the @entity199 mountains , boring through the hard rock of any peak that had the temerity to stand in its path and traversing rock - strewn , river - chiseled chasms with a nonchalance only construction ambition on a grand scale can pull off			2
the tunnels are many , the steel bridges are myriad and concrete supports and structures , which hold the transport arteries in the air , creep up the snow - capped slopes like a giant , monolithic ivy			2
the buses , across the @entity97 zone , are plentiful and regular too			0
cost the investment from the @entity1 government to make the @entity32 a reality is reputed to have risen above $ 50 billion and by anyone 's standards , bar maybe a politician called @entity227 , that 's a number beyond imagination or moral reckoning			1
could such an expenditure ever be justified ? well , before any judgment , it should at least be considered that @entity0 is very different to the @entity234 , @entity235 or even @entity174 scenario			1
the coastal cluster -- actually situated in the town of @entity239 , a few miles south of @entity0 -- now boasts world - class , design - led arenas , a spectacular media center , new hotels as well as new train links and stations			1
but it 's in the mountains where the true scope of the project is revealed			0
it 's fair to say that many @entity49 locations in the @entity253 region , such as the athletes ' village , the @entity257 media center and the resort of @entity259 , more closely resemble new towns than alpine sporting facilities			0
@entity1 officials claim the sporting cost of the @entity32 is $ 6.4 billion , and the vast outlay on transport links , power supplies and sewerage should be seen as regional development and not included in the headline budget			1
the viability of its legacy will be a story for another day			0
the intangible vibe one of the most striking memories of the @entity82 experience was the feelgood factor created by an army of volunteers who turned out in their droves to help the @entity49 effort prove a success			0
@entity0 looks well - placed to continue this momentum			1
many of the temporary workforce , clad in rainbow - colored 2014 games - themed mountain apparel , stand outside for much of the day -- braving freezing temperatures -- so they can show the way to those who are lost , give advice to those confused and to make the travel - weary feel welcome			0
their @entity294 skills and enthusiasm has already left an impression , from the night - shift volunteer who helped with bag check - in at @entity301 airport to the man who helped explain the bus timetable and pickup points to this befuddled writer			0
from the students keen to take part in an event that could shape their future to those who have taken the opportunity to work in the new jobs created , there is a sense of excitement and pride			0
@entity1 , a country notorious for its autocratic government and stone - faced expressions , has historically driven fear and paranoia in many @entity322 nations			1
hosting the @entity323 is a grand welcome to the world to learn more about its culture and people , or to witness its grandstanding depending on your stance , a move that in itself is fascinating .			0

@entity0 *buildup* has been negative : security threats , gay - rights protests , corruption claims
but another narrative appears : @entity1 's bid to forge a new identity through sport
the much touted " @entity106 " around @entity0 looks to be in place
" @entity349 's most expensive road " is nothing short of an engineering marvel
