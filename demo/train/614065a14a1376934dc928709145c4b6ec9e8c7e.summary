-- former president @entity1 defended his administration 's handling of the war in @entity5 on sunday , telling @entity0 that some @entity7 allies who contributed troops to the conflict " turned out not to be willing to fight			1
" in an interview with @entity0 's @entity12 , @entity1 strongly refuted criticism that his administration took its " eye off the ball " in @entity5 when he ordered troops to invade @entity16			1
he said he ordered @entity20 forces to overthrow @entity16 dictator @entity21 with the assumption that allied forces would help make up the difference in @entity5			1
" what happened in @entity5 was that our @entity7 allies , some of them , turned out not to be willing to fight , " @entity1 said			1
" therefore , our assumption that we had ample troops -- @entity20 and @entity7 troops -- turned out to be a not - true assumption			1
" the former president did n't name any countries specifically from @entity7 , which includes 28 nations in @entity37 and @entity38			1
some 785 military personnel from @entity7 countries besides the @entity20 have been killed in @entity5 since hostilities began in october 2001 , with the @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 having the most fatalities			1
the comments by the 43rd @entity20 president , along with those of his brother and former @entity52 governor , @entity53 , aired during a @entity0 special , " @entity1 : two years later			1
" the former president addressed a host of matters in the interview , which came days after the release of his 481 - page memoir , " @entity61 , " and two days ahead of the groundbreaking for his presidential library and museum on @entity66 's campus in @entity67 , @entity68			2
@entity1 said he " felt terrible " that weapons of mass destruction were never found in @entity16 , despite the administration 's persistent and insistent case that @entity21 had them before the invasion			1
but while he took responsibility for the big push on and subsequent lack of @entity78 , the former president said he still thought the @entity16 war was justified			0
" if ( @entity21 ) was in power today , the world would be a lot worse off , " he said			0
" i believe that a free @entity16 will be transformative in the @entity83			0
" @entity1 said he had no regrets , too , about his decision near the end of his second term to push the 2008 federal bailout that loaned hundreds of billions of dollars to companies including @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
president @entity94 later successfully pressed to use billions more in federal funds to buttress the @entity20 economy , as it struggled through what 's been called " the @entity98 " marked by high unemployment and rounds of foreclosures in a percolating real estate crisis			2
" i set aside my free market principles and made a very difficult decision , " @entity1 said			2
" i believe that those decisions ... did prevent the economy from heading into a depression			0
" @entity1 said he was dismayed when his administration 's efforts to efforts to change the @entity110 -- an effort to control its costs -- failed to bear fruit			1
in late 2004 and early 2005 , his administration laid out proposals to overhaul @entity110 , in part by creating individual investment accounts that would act more like a traditional 401k and replace the current collective @entity110 pool			0
but the plan floundered under pressure from @entity122 and special interest groups such as the @entity124 , and @entity125 never even saw any formal legislation , much less voted on it			0
" not reforming @entity110 was a huge disappointment , " @entity1 said			2
@entity53 joined his brother for part of the @entity0 interview , saying he never publicly disagreed with @entity1 when he was president and is " not going to start now			1
" alluding to the hyperpartisanship in @entity133 , the former @entity52 governor said there 's still room for civility in politics			0
" i do n't think you can be against everything , just because someone has a @entity141 ( for @entity142 ) by their name and you have an @entity145 ( for @entity146 ) by your name , " @entity53 said			2
@entity1 said that he was mindful not to get involved in " name calling " as president , adding that he was n't bothered when he was targeted			1
@entity1 said , too , that he did n't support republicans challenging @entity122 ' patriotism just because they disagreed with them			1
" i do n't remember doing that personally , and that was uncalled for if that was the case , " he said			0
" patriotic people disagreed with my decisions			0
" one @entity142 he has no qualms with is his @entity160 predecessor , @entity159			0
@entity1 said he " genuinely liked " @entity159 , whom he called one of his " buddies , " in part because he 's been so " gracious " to his father , @entity164			2
ireporter : welcome back , president @entity1 the @entity1 brothers both said @entity146 ' setbacks in recent election among @entity170 -- which voted @entity142 by a 2 - to - 1 margin -- should be a top concern for the party , with @entity1 calling the situation " un problemo			1
" " part of it relates to tone , " said @entity53 , saying some @entity170 turned away from the @entity146 when some of its members spoke strongly on illegal immigration			1
" if they do n't feel welcome , they 're not going to listen to the message			0
" @entity53 reiterated that he would not run for president -- like his brother and father -- in 2012			1
the former governor also said he did not want to head the national @entity146 party because he wanted to achieve " some financial independence " for himself and his family			0
the current @entity146 party chief , @entity191 , has faced persistent criticism from sen. @entity193 , @entity145 - @entity194 , and others in recent months , even though @entity146 scored big wins in the recent mid-term elections			0
as to speculation about @entity191 's future as the party 's head , @entity53 opted not to wade into the party leadership debate , saying he was " @entity203 in relation to national @entity146 politics			2
" " if i 'm trying to achieve financial security for my family and i 'm not running for office , " @entity53 said			2
" i certainly would n't run for @entity210 chairman			0
" @entity53 said that he could see either or both of his sons , @entity53 and @entity1 , following their father , their uncle , their grandfather and their great - grandfather ( former sen. @entity216 of @entity217 ) by running for political office			1
but @entity1 said he did n't see his daughters , twins @entity220 and @entity221 , who turn 29 this month , going into politics			2
" they will be involved in helping improve people 's lives , " @entity1 said			0
" but i doubt they 'll ever run for public office			0
" as to his own future , and legacy , @entity1 said he was content to let his memoir and his decisions speak for themselves			0
" i 'm not trying to shape my legacy , " he said			0
" i 'm trying to provide data points for future historians			0

@entity1 denies his administration took its " eye off the ball " in @entity5
the 43rd president says some @entity7 allies " turned out not to be willing to fight "
@entity1 also affirms his support for the federal bailout of banks , insurers and *carmakers*
