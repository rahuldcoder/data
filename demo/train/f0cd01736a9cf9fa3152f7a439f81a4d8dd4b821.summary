@entity0 -- a 219 - year - old document that stemmed from alcohol tariffs to pay off @entity5 debts -- and signed by @entity6 -- became the property of @entity8 on thursday			1
this document , signed by @entity6 , discusses tools for customs agents to determine alcohol content for imported spirits			1
the historic letter , which has been the property of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) for the past 35 years , chronicles the federal government 's earliest efforts to regulate alcohol			1
in the document , @entity6 , the first @entity20 secretary of the treasury , discusses tools for customs agents to determine -- for tax purposes -- the alcohol content of @entity27 rum and other imported spirits			1
historians said the document is a notable footnote in @entity20 history			2
in 1789 and again in 1790 , @entity33 imposed alcohol tariffs to pay @entity5 debts			2
in response to the tax on imports , @entity20 began distilling their own spirits			2
and when the federal government began taxing those beverages , citizens staged the " @entity44 , " harassing and threatening federal agents in several cities			1
but in 1794 , the government squelched the uprising , helping to establish the federal government 's authority in disputes with individual states			1
even non-historians might appreciate the timelessness of the dog - eared document , given its skillful use of bureaucratic language to deliver bad news			2
one eye - glazing , 76 - word sentence probably can be summarized as follows : " we do n't have the thermometers you 'll need , so for now , use the ones you 've got			0
" the document , dated dec. 18 , 1790 , is an original draft of a " circular letter , " an official memo that would have been hand - copied and sent to customs officers , historians said			1
" in this circular letter , @entity6 attempts to provide customs officers with new tools to more efficiently do their jobs , " said @entity70 , acting director of @entity15			2
@entity6 notes that he is sending a hydrometer -- used to determine the specific gravity or density of liquids -- to ports so that customs officers can determine the proof of imported beverages			1
@entity6 says he intends to provide two hydrometers to every port ; one to be used as a standard or check			0
" but it is not possible in the first instance to send both			0
hence one only will accompany this letter , " he writes			0
in a postscript , he adds that he is also sending a " @entity93 " to hold liquor while its alcohol content is being measured			1
archivists said the early history of the @entity97 circular is not known			0
but in the mid- 1970s , an @entity15 spokesman and autograph collector -- @entity100 -- came across the letter in a catalog from an autograph dealer in @entity104			0
he purchased it for about $ 100 , intending to use it in an @entity15 bicentennial exhibit			0
@entity100 , now 84 , is retired and lives in @entity108			0
the document remained in an @entity15 safe until it was rediscovered by @entity15 employees during a relocation of its headquarters building in 2005			0
@entity15 officials said they had once planned to frame the letter , but were told that it would be damaged by exposure to light			0
the @entity8 said the document will become part of its permanent holdings and will be preserved in a locked , temperature and humidity - controlled stack area at its facility in @entity125 , @entity108 .			1
