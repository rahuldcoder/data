@entity0 -- elite athletes around the world are currently hard at work , cramming in a final few months of tough training ahead of the @entity6			1
what drives them all is the hope that the blood , sweat and tears they 've invested in their sporting careers over the years will mean that , come august , they are the first to run , swim or bike across that all - important finish line			1
i am not a natural sportswoman : i am hopelessly unfit and hate pretty much all forms of physical exercise , from the tyranny of team games , to the solitude of slogging around the park plugged into an @entity26			2
but despite this , i beat all those awe - inspiring olympians to it : i crossed that finish line before them , if only thanks to a quirk of timing , and the luck of the draw			1
i was one of 5,000 members of the @entity38 public whose names were pulled out of the hat to win a place in the @entity43 's @entity42 , a five - mile race around the major @entity46 venues in @entity47 , @entity0			1
and so despite my status as a running refusenik , i found myself herded , among a crowd of far fitter , healthier , sportier types , into a pen behind the start line , part of a sea of red t - shirted runners beneath a threatening gray sky			1
feeling faintly sick , i joined in as we stretched , bent , lunged and jogged on the spot , wondering why it was that i seemed to be the only one worn out by the warmup alone			0
and then , after some encouraging words from celebrities , and a bit of a singalong , the starting gun was fired and the frontrunners were off , leaving me and the rest of the back - of - the - pack bunch to watch in amazement as they raced away , haring around the course at improbable speeds that brought the fastest and fittest back into the @entity73 and across the finish line before we had even begun			2
" the bad news , " joked the compere , as he waited to wave us off , " is that you ca n't win			0
" however , he assured us , this was bound to be an amazing experience , one we would not forget			0
at that point i would have been happy to forget the whole thing , and slink off home , but it was n't to be : a rousing chorus of " @entity86 " from opera singer @entity87 , and we too were pouring across the line			0
determined to run at least a little of the course , i started as i knew i would n't be able to go on for long , jogging until the crowd thinned out and i could take up the brisk walking pace i hoped would get me back to the stadium before the street cleaners moved in to sweep the course			2
as we looped around the @entity96 at the one - mile mark , to the sounds of a samba band , the sun came out , glinting on the temporary fences , scaffolding and equipment still being used by the neon - jacketed workmen who waved and cheered on the runners -- and walkers			1
thankfully , i soon discovered i was n't the only competitor taking it slow and steady -- there were plenty of us , grinning encouragement at each other as we overtook and then were overtaken , chatting , pausing to take photos of the shiny new @entity42 venues we passed along the way , excited to be given a behind - the - scenes glimpse of the park which will be the focus of the sporting world 's attention in just a few months			1
the miles passed surprisingly quickly , and soon i was heading past the @entity119 , waving to scores of visitors who had come to see the park - in - progress , and on down into the undercroft of the athletics venue itself , where yet another broad smile spread across my face at the " @entity129 " soundtrack being relayed on speakers as we circled beneath the stadium			1
and then , buoyed up by the music , it was time for my very own snippet of @entity42 glory -- entering the echoing bowl of the stadium , to the cheers of spectators			0
it 's the moment every athlete trains their whole life for , and even an anti-sportswoman like me could n't fail to be thrilled by the sight of thousands of supporters yelling as i jogged , hobbled , and , yes , for the last few hundred yards , @entity149 towards that finish line , grinning			2
later , medal in hand , i watched , awestruck , from the stands as the winners were awarded their trophies and the final two competitors -- one using a walking frame , the other on crutches -- made it across the line to the roars of the crowd			0
come august , this place will be all about who makes it across that line fastest			0
but for one day only , it was simply about making it across the line -- and i am proud to say that i was one of the ( last to be ) first to do just that			0
@entity172 , i beat you to it .			0
