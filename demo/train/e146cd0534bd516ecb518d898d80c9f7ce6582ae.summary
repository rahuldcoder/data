-- the people have spoken			0
which , come to think of it , is where this whole problem started			0
in @entity8 last week , a @entity7 committee passed without opposition a measure that should allow the nation to breathe a grateful sigh of relief			2
the @entity14 approved a bill to prohibit phone calls on all domestic flights			1
the measure is on its way to the full @entity7 ; a similar bill is moving through the @entity20			0
what this means is that the flying public is probably safe from being surrounded by fellow passengers blabbing nonstop on their cell phones from the moment a plane takes off until the moment it lands			2
for a while there , it appeared that one of the last bastions of cell phone - free silence -- planes during flight -- was going away			1
last year , the @entity38 announced that , in its view , cell phone use no longer posed a technological threat to navigation and aeronautic safety			1
thus , the @entity38 declared , lifting the longstanding ban on phone calls from planes should be considered			1
what the @entity38 seemed to be ignoring was the hazard cell phones presented not to the electronics that guide an airplane , but to the well - being and peace of mind of passengers confined inside the cabin of a plane with nowhere to flee while rude seatmates incessantly yakked away			1
it is , at its core , a matter of consumer protection			0
if cell phone voice calls were permitted , flight attendants would be placed in the impossible position of having to referee disputes between passengers who , jammed tightly into their seats on packed planes , argued over telephone etiquette and common courtesy ( which is no longer so common at all )			1
travelers would demand to be moved ; when no others seats were available , hand - to - hand combat might break out			0
on a street or in a public building , you can always walk away from a loud and obnoxious cell phone user			1
on a plane ? where are you supposed to go ? there is a simple solution to satisfy those who wish to communicate with people on the ground during a flight : allow text messages , e-mails and social network postings from the air			2
engaging in those activities actually calms passengers , soothes their nerves			0
@entity94 calls ? the opposite			0
which , in a rare spirit of bipartisan wisdom , @entity8 appears to understand			2
the chairman of the @entity100 that advanced last week 's measure , @entity102 @entity99 of @entity103 , cited a poll that said 59 % of @entity105 who flew at least once last year oppose allowing phone calls on planes , and that among @entity105 who fly more frequently -- four or more flights a year -- 78 % oppose the phone calls			1
" most passengers would like their flights to go by as quickly and quietly as possible , " @entity99 said			0
a @entity113 on the committee -- @entity115 of @entity116 -- agreed : " the prospect of sitting among dozens of people all talking on their cell phones in a confined space raises serious safety , if not comfort , considerations especially at a time when passengers face less legroom , higher fees and pricey flights			1
" @entity115 said that when the @entity38 raised the possibility of allowing phone calls on commercial flights , " a chill went through the flying public and flight attendants nationwide			1
" it 's not hard to figure out why members of @entity8 are willing to take these steps now : it is one of those unusual occasions when they sense they will be applauded by a thankful public			2
@entity8 is n't taking anything away from anyone ; a new law would merely pre-emptively make sure that no one gets very far with the idea of letting cell phones on flights			1
and no member of @entity8 is likely to be the one to demand that voice calls be made a part of flying			1
the public tends to connect the results of infuriating political decisions with the government officials who promoted them ; any time a booming - voiced , serial - calling passenger ruined the flights of the people around him , the simmering anger would be directed at the politicians who had made that possible			2
@entity8 , by moving to prohibit inflight calls , is doing the airlines a favor			1
as with smoking onboard , it takes the decision out of the individual airlines ' hands , so flight crews wo n't have to negotiate with enraged passengers			2
and , absent clear - cut rules , if one airline did choose to permit phone calls in the air , you can imagine the television commercials that its competitors would run in an effort to put it out of business : an opening shot of a cabin full of passengers shouting into their phones , yelling " can you hear me ? " , telling longwinded jokes and laughing at top volume , barking orders at business subordinates back at the office , braying " you 're fading in and out -- what did you just say ? " , giving high - decibel and endlessly detailed recitations of what they had for dinner the night before			1
a roaring , earsplitting jumble of sound , each passenger with a phone to his or her ear			0
and then the next shot in the commercial : a quiet cabin filled with people reading , working on their computers , smiling silently at e-mails and text messages			0
followed by the logo of that second airline , with a come - fly - with - us invitation to travel in a civilized way			0
which of those flights seems preferable ? you make the call			0
( on second thought ... do n't			0
) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			0

@entity223 : @entity100 ok *'d* bill to ban in - flight cell phone calls . this is good news
he says poll shows most people against voice calls on planes ; @entity8 seems to get this
passengers might be trapped on flight with noisy callers ; chaos could easily ensue
@entity223 : @entity241 knows if that occurs , fliers will blame them ; they should ensure ban happens
