-- when @entity3 lost her dog , @entity5 , on a morning walk , the last thing she expected was to find him with the help of hundreds of strangers on the @entity9			1
but since @entity10 was desperate to track him down , she did just that -- by going to popular internet forum @entity13 and posting a plea on the @entity16 board for residents to look out for her dog			1
after an outpouring of people offered to keep an eye out , one @entity13 user found @entity5 wandering in the parking lot of a grocery store and reached out to let below know			1
" @entity26 ! ! ! ! and you did it ! ! ! ! ! i have to leave to take him to the vet but he seems like maybe he 's ok			2
i could kiss you all ! , " @entity32 wrote on the forum			1
below , a professor at the @entity36 , told @entity37 that she was originally worried that she could n't dedicate the time to @entity5 that he deserved			2
after finding the dog wandering dazed in the middle of the street in early september , she took him in and tried to do what she could to nurse him back to health			1
" he had skin infections , eye infections			2
he was filthy , malnourished , you name it , " she said			0
" he seemed sweet for a dog that did n't seem coherent			1
i have never owned a dog before , but i did my best to nurse him back to health			1
" after a few rounds of meds and some good rest , @entity5 seemed to be making a speedy recovery ... but @entity32 's plan to find him a home elsewhere was quickly eroding			1
" i kept seeing this incredible personality come out of him , " she told @entity37			0
" when we went to the vet to get his issues addressed , he just set his chin on my knee and waited calmly while he got prodded and poked			0
he had only known me for a week , and he had stolen my heart			0
" @entity32 had made the decision to keep @entity5 in early october			0
she , @entity5 and a neighbor were walking in an empty lot near her home on december 1 when @entity5 slipped through a gap in the fence and took off			0
below watched as he ran into the street and was hit by a big , white truck			0
" he bounced off the truck , got up and ran back toward us			0
i thought he was coming back , but he darted off instead			0
and i knew i had to find him , " she told @entity37			1
that night , @entity32 decided to take to @entity13 to see if she could spread the word to look for @entity5			1
she posted in several different forums and went to sleep after spending time with supportive friends			0
the next morning , she woke up to hundreds of messages			1
a @entity13 user put her in touch with a man that maintains a large email list of people involved in animal rescue , which eventually led to one of the people on the list finding @entity5			1
@entity32 was at work at around 3:30 p.m. monday when she got a phone call from a woman who said she had her eyes on @entity5 nearby			0
below darted as fast as her legs could carry her to find them			1
" a man came up to me when i was running to meet her and asked if i had seen a dog , and i said " i 'm looking for my dog ! ' and he said ' i 'm from @entity13 ! ' it was crazy and amazing , " @entity32 said			1
below finally found @entity5 with the woman who had contacted her , and when she did , the reunion was nothing but tears and palpable relief			0
" i saw his body relax as soon as he saw me , " she told @entity37			0
" so i had this scared , filthy dog in my arms , and i was crying			2
there just are n't words			0
" below said that the support from @entity13 stunned and amazed her			1
" i got e-mails from people that said ' i go on a walk every day			2
i 'll reroute near where @entity5 was lost and look for him			2
' one woman said she was stuck at home with an injury and had nothing to do , so she would go look for him			0
and even when we found him , we met someone who was out looking for him , " she told @entity37			0
while not a heavy @entity13 user before now ( below describes herself as more of a " lurker " ) , she said that the site is an incredible tool for gathering information and that she uses it daily to keep an eye on what 's going on in the world			1
" it curates the entire internet for you , " she told @entity37			2
" and thanks to it , i found my dog			2
