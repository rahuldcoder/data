tattooed and pale , with an @entity3 vocabulary of a few dozen words at best , 24 - year - old @entity1 @entity0 is not who you would expect to see striding up and down the corridors of a hospital in @entity9 , @entity10 , clutching a wad of bloodied bandages			1
" this is one of the worst wounds we have on the floor ; this one is pretty bad , " he says as he works to help clean out the raw lower leg wound of a patient			2
" they were going to have to amputate the leg , but they were able to reconnect the artery , right , " he asks @entity20 , a 27 - year - old nurse from @entity21 , @entity22 , who , like most of those @entity0 works alongside , fled his homeland to treat his countrymen in @entity10			1
despite the language barrier , the two have bonded , as @entity0 has managed to with all those he 's been interacting with , the type of unique bond born of shared intense experience whether it 's with the patients , some who do n't survive or the doctors and nurses who have suffered horrors @entity0 is only beginning to comprehend			1
" there is this impression , this belief that there is no hope , " he explains			2
" that 's when it 's more important than ever that we come in against all odds and we do something			1
" how did an @entity1 end up in a @entity10 hospital treating wounded @entity22 from months of escalating violence ? @entity0 's journey began when he joined the @entity55 in 2006 and deployed to @entity56 in 2007			1
he was honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour and returned to the @entity1 to study political science and train for 1500 - meter runs			1
but something was n't right			2
" i was going to school with kids who look the same , were the same age as me , but we were n't the same , " he says			2
" i wanted more of a challenge , a sense of purpose			2
" portraits of conflict : can an image stop the bloodshed ? in 2010 , @entity0 took time off and began his certification as an emergency medical technician			2
in the two years that followed he fell in love , got married and quickly divorced			2
devastated and heartbroken , he went back to school , but he could n't shake his depression			2
" i needed to make a drastic decision			2
it was a huge identity thing ; it was time to re-evaluate , " he says			0
" i needed a game changer			1
" he decided he would head to @entity84 , follow the situation in @entity22 and try to help			1
so on his spring break this year he packed his medical kit and flew into the @entity10 capital			1
" i took a chance , " he says			0
" there was n't a single person when i told them i was coming to @entity10 who said , ' yeah , that 's a great idea			1
' " the next two weeks were filled with eye - opening misadventures as @entity0 began to scratch at the surface of the complexities of the @entity22 conflict and the @entity101 as a whole			1
" i had learned enough to know that i did n't know anything , " he says			0
after finishing the semester back in the @entity1 , he returned to @entity10 , only this time with a plan			1
" we each get one life and that 's it			1
we get one shot at this and we do n't get any do - overs , and for me , it was time to put up or shut up , " he says			1
" the way i saw it , i did n't have a choice			0
this is what i was put here to do			0
i guess i am just a hopeless romantic , and i am an idealist , and i believe in hopeless causes			0
" @entity0 is now working to start a number of projects to help those in need and putting his emt skills to use whenever he can			0
" i am not a doctor			0
i am not a nurse			0
but i am a guy who can clean up bandages , help clean up patients , swap out bandages , help run ivs , make people 's quality of life a little bit better , " he says			1
" this is something for me that has meaning , that has purpose			0
" some of those @entity0 helps to treat are rebel fighters , all who vow they will return to the battlefield as soon as they can			1
others are the innocent victims of a spiraling conflict			0
lying in one of the hospital beds is 24 - year - old @entity146			1
she says she and her three children were run over by a military jeep as they were trying to escape the @entity22 military siege of their village			1
her spinal cord was crushed , leaving her unable to move from the neck down			0
she was smuggled across the border to @entity10 for surgery			1
she 's only just started to be able to regain feeling			1
she smiles bravely but is unable to stop the tears from rolling down her face			0
" all i want is to be able to hold my children in my arms again , " she says softly , trying but failing to imitate the cradling of a child			0
despite dangers , doctors honor oath in a secret @entity22 field hospital in a room across the hall , @entity167 smiles devilishly as she tells us she 's 7 , laughing as her older sisters correct her			1
both her little legs are bandaged , a result of gunshot wounds she sustained as her family was fleeing the violence and their vehicle came under fire			0
" it just itches , " she says , giggling and insisting she was never afraid			0
other wounds are more gruesome : dr. @entity182 , also a refugee from @entity21 , shows pictures on his cell phone of a raw wound , crawling with maggots			0
there 's another photo of a young man with all of the flesh on his back removed -- a patient they were unable to save			1
it was a case that caused @entity0 to begin to appreciate just what it was they were up against			0
" the tissue had turned necrotic , which basically means it was dead , " @entity0 explains			0
" we had to cut out a huge piece of skin , the whole upper side of his back			0
" it 's what happens when the wounded ca n't be evacuated in time			1
a bitter lesson @entity22 know too well			1
@entity0 says his direct exposure to what was something of an alien conflict and culture before has now transformed his perspective			0
" there is this mentality from where i come from back home that i have a little bit of a problem with , " he says			2
" i do n't want to get on a political soap box , but at the same time we have to think about why as a country we choose to help certain people and not others			0
" we have to think about why we just chalk up the @entity101 [ as ] this complex enigma that we will never understand because they are so different from us			2
but at the end of the day , they are really not			0
it 's just about whether or not you 're willing to go out on a limb and understand something , " he says			1
" @entity0 can tell the @entity1 people who we are , " says @entity20 , the @entity22 nurse			1
" we are not what the regime says we are -- terrorists and @entity236			0
@entity0 knows we are good people , who love joking and laughter			0
we just want to live			0
" @entity0 has been struck by the resilience of the @entity22 he has met , by their ability to smile and somehow joke even in the darkest of circumstances			1
" this kid has his leg blown off , " he says , " and he still had the ability to crack jokes and smile , and he had the doctor cracking up			0
he had the whole room laughing			0
that 's just the way they are , the people that i have met and worked with in the hospital			2
it 's been absolutely humbling			2
" sitting in the room where the hospital workers also sleep , @entity0 stares up at the tv screen , always following with everyone else the news in @entity22 , image after image of death and destruction			1
he says he believes that @entity1 has lost its humanity , that the nation needs to take a firm political stance , although he 's not advocating military intervention			1
" this is real , and it 's scary stuff , and it 's sad what is happening to people here , " he says			2
" people back home need to know about it , they need to know			2
sometimes you got ta take a stand , you got ta draw a line somewhere			0
" when outrage is n't enough your take : intervene or not ?			0
