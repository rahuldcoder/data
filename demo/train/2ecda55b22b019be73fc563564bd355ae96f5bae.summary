@entity0 -- even as @entity2 is softening its one - child policy , one if its most renowned film directors is finding himself in trouble for violating the nation 's infamous family planning law			1
@entity9 , an @entity10 nominee , is in the eye of a controversy after admitting to having three children with his wife @entity16			1
he now faces stiff fine -- and harsh public criticisms -- for breaking @entity2 's family planning rules			1
@entity2 's stringent family planning rules limit most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two , with few exceptions			1
ironically for @entity9 , his troubles come as @entity2 announced in november the decision to loosen the policy by allowing couples to have two children even if just one of them is an only child			1
last weekend , the standing committee of the @entity31 , @entity2 's legislature , formally adopted the new rules			1
even so , the new rules apparently will not help extricate @entity9 , known for movies such as " @entity34 , " " @entity35 , " and " hero , " from his current troubles			2
he also directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the @entity40			0
contrite , @entity9 , 62 , apologized in an open letter for his " excessive children			1
" " as a film director , it takes a lot of efforts and good movies for people to remember you , but having excessive children had ruined it all , " he said , according to @entity43 , @entity2 's state news agency			1
" i sincerely apologize to everyone on my ' excessive children ' case			1
i admit it 's my mistake and i wo n't blame others for it			0
" " i will learn my lessons , and i 'm willing to cooperate with any investigation from family planning commission , " @entity9 said			2
local officials decide the amount of the fine			0
in @entity67 province , where @entity9 's case is under investigation , couples who have two " beyond - the - quota " children may be fined five to eight times the annual income of the couples combined			1
if so , @entity9 is potentially liable to pay a hefty fine			1
" the case is still under investigation , " a staff at @entity76 's @entity75 bureau told @entity1			2
" we will announce the result once we have all information ready			0
" @entity9 's breach of the policy has set off a firestorm , especially among netizens who resent how the rich and famous in @entity2 flout rules and policies			1
@entity88 wrote on @entity89 , @entity2 's @entity90 - like microblogging service : " celebrities should abide laws and rules as common people			1
" but the filmmaker has defenders too			0
" he will raise his children , which has nothing to do with other people , " wrote another			0
" he does n't have to apologize			0
he did n't steal others ' children			0
he can afford to raise children and at least his children wo n't endure hardships			0
" @entity9 is no stranger to controversy			2
as one of the most inventive and admired filmmakers in @entity2 , @entity9 has won numerous awards in @entity2 and overseas			1
long before his directorial debut of his film , " @entity34 " in 1987 , he was already widely admired for his stunning camera work			0
one of his earlier films , " @entity35 " was nominated for a @entity10 as the @entity114 in 1992 , but it failed to pass the censors in @entity2 and was initially banned from local cinemas			2
censors sensitive to @entity9 's subtle metaphors banned some of his films from local cinemas , if only briefly			2
most of his films focused on the oppressiveness of conservatism			0
opinion : @entity2 is not ending its human rights abuses like most of his contemporaries who grew up during the @entity127 , @entity9 spent three years in the countryside undergoing " ideological remolding			2
" he later worked as a janitor in a textile factory			0
in the late 1970s , he taught himself photography and enrolled in the prestigious @entity133			0
@entity1 's @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .			0
