-- i am probably neither the first nor last critic to say this , but @entity6 ' " @entity5 " is a flawless film			1
there is literally nothing wrong with it			2
i do n't have a single nit to pick , minor flaw to point out or little bit that annoyed me			2
it is pure magic from the first frame to the last			2
it is proof that to be moving , engaging , enthralling and fun , movies have no need for sex or violence , color or even spoken dialog , for that matter			0
that 's not to say i do n't love many films with all those things , but " @entity5 " has distilled cinema to something it so rarely achieves : pure joy in art. this is not art for art 's sake , this is art for enjoyment 's sake			1
it 's not an " important " film that we all need to see because it 's great art ( although it is both important and art ) it is a film that everyone should see because it 's joyous			1
it 's a throwback to some of the things that brought people into the cinema in the first place			1
the chance to escape their lives and live someone else 's for a time			2
the story is relatively simple and takes plot elements from " singing in the rain , " " @entity57 " and " @entity58 " as well as the best of @entity61 melodrama			1
@entity5 ( @entity62 ) is a matinee idol , a star of the ( silent ) silver screen			1
along with his faithful @entity67 ( @entity69 ) , @entity66 stars in action adventures and is revered by men and women alike			0
it 's the age old story : men want to be him and women want to be with him			1
at the premiere of his latest blockbuster , as @entity80 is mugging for the cameras and signing autographs , he runs into @entity83 ( a luminous @entity84 ) , an aspiring actor			0
they meet cute when she is caught in the throng of autograph seekers ( she is one herself ) and suddenly finds herself on the other side of the policemen holding back the crowd and standing right next to her idol			0
taking advantage of the situation , @entity92 begins to mug , planting one on her idol 's cheek , landing the pair on the cover of @entity101 and setting the plot in motion , a variation on the old " boy meets girl " standard			1
while @entity80 is reveling in his box office glory and @entity92 is hoping to make the most of her instant fame , @entity80 's wife , @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , is stewing in jealousy and resentment			2
and while the photo in @entity101 is completely innocent , one gets the feeling her fears may not be completely groundless			0
@entity92 lands a gig as an extra in @entity80 's next film and the obvious attraction between the two begins to manifest itself			1
peppy is a starstruck aspiring actress just beginning her career in show business and @entity80 is a veteran movie star and ladies man at the top of his game			0
you also get the feeling he 's been in this situation before			2
things are going well for @entity80			0
despite the unrest at home , he 's got a new film , he 's got a new crush and all is right in his world , until the head of the studio , @entity138 ( @entity139 ) , begins to embrace the talkies			1
while @entity138 is convinced that the advent of sound is the future of film , @entity80 is convinced the public will stick with him , so he bets on the continued popularity of the silent film			2
thus , his career begins to wane , just as @entity92 's beings to wax			2
the end of the silent era ( and his marriage ) and the crash of the stock market send @entity80 into a spiral of booze and self - loathing , with only his faithful dog and chauffeur @entity160 ( @entity161 ) sticking by him			0
bitter over the demise of his career , @entity80 even lashes out at what he sees as the symbol of that decline , @entity92			0
" @entity5 " is n't actually a silent film per se , as it has a score and well , i wo n't spoil it for you , but @entity6 ' use of sound is ingenious			1
however , for all intents and purposes , it is silent			0
for the actors , there was very little difference , as they still speak their lines , we just do n't hear them , but for the audience , the change is immeasurable			0
instead of watching their faces almost exclusively , we find our eyes drifting across the screen and noticing things that perhaps we might not have noticed otherwise			0
a subtle cue of body language , the placing of objects within the frame , how the music moves the action along , all of these and more come alive when we 're not tied to watching the actors speak			0
@entity6 has a deft hand at directing and a delightful sense of whimsey			0
the film is peppered with sight gags in the best of classic @entity61 tradition , and both @entity62 and @entity84 prove more than up for the task			1
a brief pantomime between @entity84 and one of @entity80 's suit jackets is worth the price of admission alone -- and keep your eye on the dog ! @entity6 and his backers took a huge risk in making the film			1
they funded a black and white , silent film with two unknown ( in the @entity219 ) leads and a handful of supporting @entity61 talent			1
however , when @entity62 picked up the best actor prize at @entity224 and reviews started to pour in , they knew they had a winner on their hands			0
a pure and open love letter to the cinema , " @entity5 " contains many nods and winks to the history of this art form and clever viewers will pick up on a few cues			1
it is , as i have mentioned , a comedy , a melodrama and a romance , but above all , it fulfills the promise of what cinema can be at its best			0
it takes us on a journey up to the peaks and down in the valleys , through love , loss , heartbreak and despair and right back around again to love			2
" @entity5 " is rated @entity253 , although it 's on the tame end of the scale			1
a bird is flipped , there are a few moments of characters in jeopardy and quite a bit of smoking , if that sort of thing bothers you .			0

" @entity5 " is a film everyone should see because it 's joyous
the story is relatively simple and takes plot elements from " @entity273 "
the film is peppered with sight gags in the best of classic @entity61 tradition
