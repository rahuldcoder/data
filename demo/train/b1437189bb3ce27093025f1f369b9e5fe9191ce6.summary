@entity1 police on sunday arrested senior journalists , media executives and even the scriptwriter for a popular television series on charges of " forming , leading and being a member of an armed terrorist organization			1
" the more than two dozen arrests followed another series of police raids on december 17 of last year , in which prominent supporters of the government , including the sons of ministers and the head of a state - owned bank , were interrogated on charges of corruption			1
in almost all cases , those year - old charges have been dropped			0
the current crop of detentions are people associated with the influential @entity27 religious movement and whose followers have an active network of schools and businesses			1
the government accuses the movement of infiltrating the police and judiciary			2
among those now detained are @entity37 , editor - in - chief of @entity38 , the country 's widest circulating newspaper			0
police arriving at 7.30 a.m. were greeted by scores of protesters shouting " a free media can not be silenced			0
" journalists and @entity27 supporters had mounted a vigil after tweets from " @entity49 " -- a reliable but anonymous source -- had warned of the raid			1
police retreated only to reappear in the afternoon when @entity37 gave himself up voluntarily			0
also in custody are @entity54 , the head of the @entity58 - affiliated @entity57 television , as well as the director , producers and writer of long - running political soap operas that cast aspersions on the government 's attempt to broker a deal with @entity68 militants by depicting it as a conspiracy hatched in the corridors of @entity72			1
for the past year , the government has been waging a campaign against the @entity76 spiritual leader @entity27 , who lives in self - imposed exile in the @entity78 of @entity79			1
in the pro-government press , even the word @entity79 has become synonymous with a conspiracy to create what is called a " parallel " state by overthrowing the elected government of @entity86 , former prime minister and now president			0
the @entity58 - affiliated movement counters that these accusations are simply a smokescreen to cover up corruption in high places , including the president 's own family			1
for the past 12 months , suspected @entity95 in the bureaucracy have been let go from key positions and laws enacted that will shut down a chain of university tutorial colleges affiliated to the movement			0
" whether driven by a desire to shift public attention from the anniversary of corruption probes , or by public criticisms of systematic nepotism and excesses of the presidential palace , these raids and arrests are politically motivated , " the @entity104 , an organization that represents @entity106 groups affiliated with the @entity58 movement , said in a statement			1
" such actions taint @entity1 's image around the world and raise the growing authoritarianism of the @entity86 regime to a new level			2
" until recently , the @entity58 movement had been among @entity86 's most enthusiastic supporters			1
the @entity126 was a cheerleader of a series of trials that involved scores of military officers convicted of trying to stage a coup d'Ã©tat			0
journalists critical of the @entity95 ' political ambitions also stood trial , including the freelance writer @entity136 , who spent 2011 - 2012 in prison awaiting trial			0
@entity136 has refused to have his revenge eaten cold			0
while the @entity58 community may have " served fascism a few years ago , what happened to them is also fascism , " he tweeted at the news of sunday 's raid			2
indeed many observers see the crackdown as a growing example of @entity86 's increasing authoritarian rule			0
" these arrests appear to be government retribution against journalists reporting on corruption and criticizing the government			2
the crackdown on speech in @entity1 must end , said @entity158 , executive vice president of @entity159 , the @entity160 - based democracy watchdog that this year downgraded the @entity1 press from being " partly free " to " not free			2
" " the situation changes when people ... try to take control of the bureaucracy and thus declare war against the country 's elected government , " said @entity162 , @entity86 's successor as prime minister			0
a statement by the @entity172 last week cautioned @entity1 , a key @entity173 ally , not to violate its " own democratic foundations " while drawing attention to raids against media outlets " openly critical of the current @entity1 government			1
