not one , but two @entity3 citizens have been connected to beheadings in a recent @entity6 video , both of them 22 - year - old men who went to @entity9 to join the group , authorities said wednesday			1
the @entity13 prosecutor 's office on wednesday identified @entity14 , a convert to @entity15 from the @entity13 suburb of @entity17 who was well - known to @entity3 anti-terror authorities before the @entity6 video release			1
why are so many young @entity3 turning to jihad ? in fact , an october 2013 warrant for @entity14 ' arrest was issued as part of an investigation into @entity3 citizens who had gone to @entity9 to take part in @entity6 jihad there , the prosecutor 's office said			1
@entity14 joins @entity34 , who authorities said monday was also on the video , released over the weekend , that depicts in graphic detail , the beheadings of men whom @entity6 militants claim were @entity9 government pilots			1
it also shows the aftermath of another beheading in which the victim in not clearly recognizable , but that the @entity47 government says was @entity47 aid worker @entity48			0
public prosecutor @entity50 described @entity34 -- who went to @entity9 in 2013 and visiting @entity51 the previous year -- is a " self - radicalized " jihadist who traveled to the region under the guise of a humanitarian mission			2
he was known to @entity3 security services as far back as 2011 , the prosecutor said			0
more barbaric @entity6 videos expected after @entity48 's death , analyst says speaking from @entity62 alongside prime minister @entity63 , @entity3 president @entity61 said his country 's judicial system will work to establish " exactly what role " the two @entity3 men played , though the mere fact they came from @entity3 and became involved at all warrants attention and action			1
" we have to be even more aware , even in terms of the information that needs to be handed out , in terms of the danger that internet sites carry and how these young people can be indoctrinated , " @entity61 said			0
" they could be from any background , from any ethnic origin , but they easily can be brainwashed into becoming converts			0
" the ranks of @entity6 -- the extremist group calling itself the @entity86 that 's taken over vast swaths of @entity9 and @entity88 -- have swelled with volunteers coming from outside the region , including from the @entity91			1
how foreign fighters are bolstering @entity6 intelligence estimates indicate that more than 100 of the foreign fighters in @entity88 and @entity9 have come from the @entity47			1
hundreds more arrived from @entity96 , including more than 900 @entity3 citizens that country 's government believes are involved in the jihad there			1
this influx has spurred concerns that some of these fighters could bring the fight back home , perhaps with attacks inside @entity109 nations			0
those worries have been heightened by the group 's brutal tactics against foe and civilians alike , such as raping , enslaving and selling @entity88 women belonging to the @entity118 religious minority			0
last week , a @entity120 panel stated what many consider obvious : @entity6 has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in @entity9			2
@entity118 women ' treated like cattle ' the most high - profile of these abuses -- because they were taped and publicized as propaganda , for all the world to see -- have been the beheadings of @entity6 captives			2
the mother of the first @entity47 so killed , journalist @entity134 , said that her family is in touch with @entity48 's family and that they are " heartbroken another @entity47 has given his life for the suffering people of @entity9			1
" the @entity91 is fighting back , with many countries -- including @entity3 -- allying with @entity88 to conduct airstrikes targeting @entity6 in that country			1
the @entity47 has also led airstrikes going after the group in @entity9			1
from monday to wednesday , for instance , the @entity47 - led coalition launched five airstrikes near the northern @entity9 city of @entity152 and one targeting an oil collection point in @entity154 , in addition to a strike targeting a facility purportedly used by the so - called @entity158			1
there were even more strikes in @entity88 , including 13 near @entity161 , seven near @entity162 , three near @entity163 and one near @entity164 , according to the @entity47 military			1
opinion : @entity48 's murder a sign of weakness from a terror group on the run @entity6 has n't relented much either , including unleashing yet more violence wednesday			0
at least four people died and 29 others were wounded after a vehicle drove up to the entrance to a government building in @entity178 , the strongly fortified capital of @entity179 , and exploded , according to @entity181 spokesman @entity180			0
police " who tried to stop " the vehicle were among the dead , he said			0
@entity180 added that @entity6 -- which is active in northern @entity88 -- claimed responsibility for the attack			2
meanwhile , fighting continues in @entity9 as well , some of it near the @entity190 border			0
@entity193 , the former commander of @entity47 forces in @entity195 now charged with coordinating the coalition to battle @entity6 , met with officials in the @entity190 capital of @entity199 about that fight on wednesday			2
the same day , @entity190 president @entity201 called for more to be done -- including establishing no - fly zones and bolstering " train and equip " efforts for those fighting @entity6			2
@entity190 has spoken out against @entity6 , while also expressing opposition to groups of @entity209 fighters that are among those trying to defeat the group			0
" the coalition powers still have not taken these steps we asked for and recommended , " @entity201 said , according to a report from the semi-official @entity214 news agency			0
" we are living this process on small hints and possibilities			0
" @entity1 's @entity221 and @entity222 in @entity13 , @entity223 in @entity224 , as well as @entity1 's @entity225 and journalist @entity226 in @entity227 , @entity190 , contributed to this report .			0
