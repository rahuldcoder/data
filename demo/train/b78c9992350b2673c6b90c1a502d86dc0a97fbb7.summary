@entity0 ca n't go to the grocery store without making a list , even for a single item			1
he ca n't drive without gripping the steering wheel so hard his knuckles turn white			2
and he ca n't stand any longer than 30 minutes because of severe back pain			2
this is @entity0 's life after @entity8 , where firefights and a roadside bomb blast left him with a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder			1
his ears still ring from the explosions			2
he suffers from vertigo , headaches , insomnia and nightmares			2
he has terrible anxiety , evident in an interview with @entity21 -- @entity0 could hardly sit still , and his memory loss and inability to concentrate meant questions had to be repeated at times			1
" i need to discover who i am again , " he said			2
as a staff sergeant in the @entity27 , @entity0 most recently was deployed in 2010 to one of the most dangerous spots in @entity8			1
there he survived firefights and blasts and witnessed much carnage in @entity35 province , near the volatile @entity8 - @entity37 border			2
after returning home , @entity0 faced a much different battle , one that neither he nor his wife , @entity40 , expected			1
confusion is ' monumental ' the @entity42 said it is on track to process 1 million disability claims this year			1
with the war in @entity46 over and the one in @entity8 winding down , the @entity42 is sorting through a backlog of more than 860,000 disability claims from @entity50 veterans			1
more than a quarter of those vets -- 228,000 -- have been waiting for a year or more			1
@entity0 has been trying to get his disability claim fully processed since january 2011 , shortly after he returned from @entity8			1
the litany of delays includes lost paperwork , long wait times for appointments and erroneous lab results			1
at one point , a doctor prescribed him medication for a bladder infection he did n't have ; he 'd never given as much as a urine sample			2
because of his debilitating injuries , neither @entity0 nor his wife , @entity40 , is able to work full time			1
@entity0 said without his wife 's care , " i 'd be in the fetal position			1
i 'd be curled up in a ball			0
i could n't do it			0
" he can afford it , she ca n't : couple 's health care dilemma the @entity78 and their 23 - year - old daughter , @entity80 , are living at his mother 's home outside @entity83			1
@entity40 and @entity80 share a bedroom , while @entity0 sleeps on the living room couch every night			1
at 51 , he said that makes him feel ashamed			0
" i feel low , " he said			0
" how can i support my family , let alone ... keep a roof over their head so that my daughter can have her own room ? my wife and i ca n't have a bed to sleep together ? we 're on couches			0
... that hurts a lot			0
" part of the problem , the @entity42 said , is that many veterans are returning with severe and complex mental injuries			1
these veterans file multiple claims , far more than ever before , and sometimes they file incomplete paperwork			1
the backlog also increased when hundreds of thousands of vets were finally allowed to file claims for @entity111 and @entity112 syndrome			1
last year , the @entity42 said it paid out nearly $ 5 billion in compensation			1
in august 2011 , the @entity42 told @entity0 his claim was in review and , four months later , he was told to expect a decision by the end of the year			1
both he and @entity40 wrote numerous letters seeking help , including one to first lady @entity122 , with a copy sent to @entity42 secretary @entity124			1
three months ago , the @entity125 finally heard from the va about his claim			2
it rejected coverage for his traumatic brain injury , granting him limited disability coverage that amounts to about $ 660 a month			2
attempts to get full disability coverage have left the @entity132 often lost in a morass of red tape and confusing policies at dozens of offices in various veterans medical centers			2
" that is trademark va -- that you get answers , and then a different answer from the same building , but a different floor or a different office , " @entity145 said			0
" and the confusion that ensues is monumental			0
" the @entity125 are not alone			0
two - thirds of the 860,000 applicants have been waiting longer than the 125 days that @entity124 set as a goal for processing claims			2
on average , the @entity42 said veterans wait more than eight months -- 256 days -- before their claim is resolved			1
@entity21 interviewed 16 veterans for this report , all of whom recounted monthslong waits to get a simple evaluation of their disabilities			0
many said they had not received prompt help for serious mental health issues			0
one vet said he called a @entity42 suicide prevention hotline , was told he would be called back , and a return call never came -- a situation the agency said never should have happened			1
@entity42 official : backlog ' unacceptable ' @entity171 , the @entity42 's assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs , said the current backlog " is unacceptable , and we know that			1
" but he added , " this is a problem that has been decades in the making			0
" " we 're transitioning from a paper - based system to an electronic system , and it is a huge amount			0
it is a huge undertaking and task , " he said			0
only a small fraction of the @entity42 's regional offices has computerized their records so far			1
the vast majority are still tracking veterans on entirely paper files -- a process that 's not only slow and inefficient but also requires massive space and numbers of files			0
the toll of war now includes more amputees " we 're moving from these mountains and mountains ( of paper ) , sifting through papers , scanning them , digitizing them , creating a secure environment where these claims can be moved through much quicker , " @entity171 said			2
but @entity207 , the founder of the @entity208 , said veterans who are fighting for their disability claims are angry and tired of the rhetoric			1
" there 's a big difference between what they 're saying in @entity216 , and what you see on the ground , " @entity207 said			0
" the guys on the ground -- they do n't care about paperwork , or slow improvements			0
they care if they got a decision back from the @entity42			1
" @entity226 is another veteran who knows about the problem			2
he ultimately got his disability payments , but it took him two years to get his full amount			2
" it was n't just the stress of not having the compensation , " he said			0
" it was the stress of ' is this going to happen ? ' or ' when is this going to happen ? ' or ' how is this going to happen ? ' or ' what 's the next speed bump going to be ? ' " @entity226 left the @entity27 in 2009 as a staff sergeant after 10 years in the service			0
he served two combat tours in @entity8 and one in @entity46 with the @entity242 , earning two @entity244 medals			0
but his service left him with a long list of injuries , including degenerative bone disease in both knees , asthma , hearing loss and a mild traumatic brain injury resulting from exposure to constant explosions and gunfire			0
@entity226 was also diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , which he said has increased his irritability and affects his concentration			0
he formally filed for disability in @entity260 , @entity261 , in july 2010			2
it was n't until after he received media attention for his plight that his file was reviewed nearly two years later			0
after 21 months , the @entity42 rated him 40 % disabled due to knee injury , asthma and hearing loss , awarding him $ 560 a month in compensation			1
following new appointments to assess his brain injury and ptsd claims , the @entity42 upgraded @entity226 's disability rating to 80 % in @entity274			1
his monthly disability payment went up to $ 1,427			2
critics told @entity21 that veterans have an expression among them that the @entity42 's policy is " delay , deny until we die			1
" asked about that complaint , the @entity42 's @entity171 responded , " what i would say is that there are many veterans out there that love their va care			1
" a different man @entity0 plans to appeal the @entity42 's ruling against covering his traumatic brain injury as a disability -- a decision that could mean another two years of red tape			1
" he 's got the injury , but it 's zero for that , " @entity145 said , referring to the disability coverage			2
she said she thinks the @entity42 made its ruling based on outdated medical information from last year			1
" we filed a second claim stating that he has new symptoms , worsening symptoms , like vertigo ... the dizziness , the daily headaches , his agitation , his marked personality changes , " she said			0
@entity305 helping war veterans heal a @entity42 doctor has diagnosed that @entity0 has a traumatic brain injury			1
however , some of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries overlap , @entity145 said , " and we 're very well aware of that			0
but this is n't only ptsd			0
" she said she wants her husband to get the respect he deserves after he risked his life for his country			0
" he could 've been killed			0
every time i spoke to him on the phone i thought it might be the last time i heard his voice , " she said			0
but she added , " our relationship has had to take a hit			0
i 'm married to a different man now			0
just as much as i 've always loved him			0
" the @entity332 said they are not looking for a handout and want to work			0
" we 're not a charity case , and we 're not looking for sympathy , " @entity145 said			0
" we 're angry about the @entity42			1
we 're angry about so many things , including all of the other soldiers and veterans that are waiting longer than we have			0

veteran @entity0 waited for more than a year for disability benefits
the @entity42 expects 1 million claims this year alone
the backlog has meant an average wait of eight months
