@entity0 , @entity1 -- at 11 pm , the tired and the injured gathered in @entity0 for one last expression of discontent			1
more than a thousand sat in @entity5 , a square in the center of the city , chanting against the government and the police			2
but they were n't the crowd 's only enemy			1
a sign hung from a nearby balcony			0
it read : " @entity16			0
" on the pavement the words " a @entity18 " had been painted : " @entity21 , @entity18 , " in @entity20			1
the roads had been blocked off by the military police , who watched the protesters from afar			1
a bank of police horses chewed on piles of hay left for them on the road			2
@entity31 , a technician in his 20s , stood nearby cradling his arm , an ice pack on top of a bloody bandage			0
he peeled it off to reveal an ugly red welt on his left hand			0
" a bullet , " he explained			0
the day was supposed to have been something of a coronation for @entity0 , a relatively quiet and small city -- if a population of 2.5 million people could ever be called small -- surrounded by mountains , an hour 's flight north of @entity47			2
its famous @entity49 football stadium had just hosted its first match of the @entity51 , a 6 - 1 victory for @entity54 champions @entity55 against the tiny @entity57 islanders of @entity58			0
it was a dry run for next year 's @entity64 finals which return to @entity1 for the first time since 1950 , a chance to prove that the country was ready to host the most world 's most popular sports tournament			1
instead , military and civilian helicopters flew overhead , roads were blocked and military police stationed throughout the city as a series of protests sparked by anger about the cost of living , poor quality education and high transport costs took place at the same time as the match			1
the initial spark for the protests was a rise in bus fares in @entity82			1
the anger was such that , even in a country often caricatured for its deification of soccer , the @entity64 , its surrogate cousin the @entity87 and the game 's global governing body @entity18 , have all become symbolic of corruption and waste			1
protesters believe the tournament has seen the rich line their pockets , while the poor make do with crumbling public services			2
the @entity64 , it seems , has sparked something that has lain dormant for a long time			1
" tonight this is about all of @entity1 , we are moving against corruption			1
we have been suffering for too many years , " said @entity102 , a teacher who had remained with the protest until the end			0
" and this year we rise			1
we are on the streets like in @entity106 and @entity107			0
they have made us wake up about this			0
the @entity64 in @entity1 is about too much money			1
there are too many poor people suffering			0
the @entity64 is n't good for @entity1			1
it will bring tourists and money but this is not good for poor people			0
" earlier in the day 15,000 protesters had marched towards the @entity49 as hundreds of thousands of @entity1 took to the streets across the country in the first coordinated mass protests of this size since the end of @entity1 's military dictatorship in the mid 1980s			1
police responded with tear gas , firing rubber bullets into the crowd , and beat protesters who burned barricades in return			1
i watched @entity58 's brave performance on the pitch as the protesters gathered outside , speaking to @entity1 sports writer @entity135 at half time about the match and the reasons for the anger			1
a few hours later he was in hospital after apparently being shot in the back with a rubber bullet			0
" the police came with a brutal force , " recalled @entity135			2
" i did n't see the protesters do anything			2
the police threw a bomb and it exploded in the middle of the protest			2
then police began to shoot			2
" @entity135 said he was hit in the back by a rubber bullet as he ran away			0
" in that moment i just ran			0
i thought that if i looked back the police would probably shoot me again			2
i do n't think the police are well prepared			2
they have a bad life			0
they act like this because they are scared			0
" but @entity135 said he has doubt that the police response was related to the @entity87			1
" i spoke to one of the highest ranked police guys in state yesterday			0
he told me 3,500 policeman were on the streets because of the game			0
they are acting to avoid conflict near the stadiums			0
the police and @entity18 do n't want the protesters near the stadiums			1
" for @entity18 , who have been critical of @entity1 's preparations for the @entity64 , the protests are an unwelcome complication for a tournament already long behind schedule			1
" people are using the platform of football and the international media presence to make certain demonstrations , " said @entity18 president @entity182 who , alongside the @entity1 president @entity189 , was booed by the crowd at the opening ceremony on saturday			1
speaking in an interview in @entity47 on monday , he said : " you will see today is the third day of the competition this will calm down			0
it will be a wonderful competition			0
" but the protests have not calmed down			0
the day after @entity182 's interview , the biggest demonstrations yet took place			1
@entity201 and @entity102 agreed that the @entity87 , which continues for another 12 days , is an opportunity to make their voices heard			1
i asked them both what messaged they wanted to send @entity18 and the football world			1
" please , please , make more pressure on our government , on the @entity1 government to look out for us , " said @entity102 before she made her way back into the protest , @entity31 still clutching his injured hand			2
" they are looking out for people outside the country , they are n't looking for us , for the poor people			0
" the protestors now have the world 's attention .			0

protesters and police have *battled* each other in some @entity1 cities
the protests , sparked by a rise in bus fares , point to deeper discontent
some protesters say they are *unhappy* at the cost of next year 's @entity64
