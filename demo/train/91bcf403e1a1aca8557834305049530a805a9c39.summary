use your @entity6 acount to ask those following you for recommendations on the area you 're staying in			2
@entity13 ( mapness.net ) although it 's ostensibly designed for travel journaling , this clickable atlas can also help with planning by letting you create custom maps of your travels			1

finally , once you 've arrived , you can also add photos and videos to document your trip for posterity			2
@entity40 ( hazelmail.com ) everyone loves to get postcards , but actually messing with the mail while on vacation can make you go , well , postal			2
( and in any case , do you really want a cheesy image from the hotel gift shop to stand as the definitive shot of your journey ? ) roll your own postcards instead			2
at @entity40 , named for its founder 's mom , you can upload your photographs and then enter a message and an address			2
the web site takes care of the rest , printing out and mailing a freshly minted postcard ( and saving you from having to track down stamps )			2
the flat fee of $ 1.50 includes postage to anywhere			0
@entity64 ( eye.fi / cards / explore / ) there 's no reason to wait until you get home to upload your photos from your trip , thanks to this camera memory card that gives your camera @entity75 connectivity			1

the @entity85 works with open wireless networks , and you can set it to automatically join them once you come into range			0
the purchase of the card also gives you the ability to use any @entity93 hotspot for a year ( there are more than 10,000 of such spots nationwide )			1
if you 're not near a free open source and you 're in the @entity98 , chances are still good that you 'll be able to find a @entity93 spot to upload your photos			0
also fun : the @entity85 uses @entity75 signals to store location data with every photos that 's taken			1
when you upload shots to geo - enabled photo - sharing services ( including @entity80 and @entity79 ) , the photos can be automatically added to a map that notes where they were taken -- and which also has links to photos that other photographers have taken nearby			0
@entity6 ( twitter.com ) even if you 're not using the micro-blogging site @entity6 to update the world with your own comings and goings , you can still use it to bring the wisdom of a savvy , global crowd to the palm of your hand			0
use your free acount to ask those following you a question ( " where can i find the best grits in @entity135 ? " ) to tap into a trove of native knowledge in real time			0
for better luck use a " hashtag " ( a keyword preceded by the pound symbol , such as # @entity135 ) that will help people find your query			0
or perhaps your question has already been answered : try @entity6 's dedicated search page			0
if you have an @entity144 , you may also want to give the applications @entity146 and twinkle a try			0

@entity175 features help you create a network of friends and share itineraries , and also add badges to your web site to show where you are and what you 're doing			1
in addition , you can export your trips to a calendar program such as @entity186 or @entity187			0
@entity190 ( google.com / voice / about ) with this phone manager , you can keep the calls coming through while you roam			0
open at the moment only to existing users of a @entity196 - owned service called @entity190 but soon to be available for everyone , @entity190 gives you a phone number which you can set to ring any phone in the @entity98 ( @entity196 plans to expand this ability worldwide )			1
even more usefully , it can be set to let only some numbers through -- for instance , maybe you want your friends but not your boss to be able to call you on that beach in @entity207			0
because you can set it to ring more than one number , @entity190 can direct the same call to your cell phone as well as the line in your vacation home			0
