-- the @entity1 has revoked the charter of a @entity4 church that refused to fire its pack 's gay scoutmaster , according to a letter written by the organization 's general counsel and provided to @entity0 by the church			1
pack and @entity12 is composed of about 15 boys , and according to attorney @entity15 's letter , they will have an opportunity to transfer to another troop			0
" as you are aware the policy of the @entity1 does not allow open or avowed homosexuals to serve as volunteer adult leaders , " read @entity15 's letter to an attorney representing @entity20			1
the church received its charter in november and selected @entity27 , a 49 - year - old @entity28 , to lead the troop			1
the rev. @entity30 said she knew @entity27 was gay , and she was n't trying to make any political statement by selecting him			1
" we were not hiding , " she said			0
" we are talking about real people that are being effected by a policy of discrimination ... by a policy that @entity1 teaches , so we are just calling it out			2
" she further said all the boys in the troop were aware of @entity27 's sexuality and that his selection was in line with the church 's philosophy of being " open to all people			1
" @entity30 has even performed same - sex marriages at the church , she said			0
@entity27 could not be reached for comment because he is out of the country , celebrating an anniversary with his partner of 20 years , @entity30 said			0
but he provided a statement to @entity55 , a group that aims to end the @entity1 ban on gay scout leaders			1
" i 'm stunned and disappointed to hear the news , " he told @entity55			0
" pastor @entity30 specifically sought out someone with my scouting background to help get these units off the ground , and her church is now being told to violate their religious convictions			0
it 's unconscionable and irreverent			0
" according to @entity55 , @entity1 questioned @entity27 's sexuality after an @entity68 report last month			1
" @entity27 , abiding by the @entity28 's commitment to trustworthiness , acknowledged his sexual orientation to the @entity1 , which in turn , responded by revoking @entity27 's status as @entity76 , " the group said on its website			1
@entity30 refused to remove @entity27 from his post , resulting in last week 's letter from @entity15 stating , " as a result of this refusal to comply with the policies , guidelines , rules and regulations of the @entity1 , @entity20 is hereby advised that it is no longer an authorized chartered organization and may no longer use the @entity80 program or any of its registered marks or brands			1
" @entity1 spokesman @entity91 added in a statement to @entity0 , " we are saddened by this development , but remain committed to providing all youth with the best possible @entity80 experience where the @entity80 program is the main focus			2
" in may , the group 's 1,400 - member national council voted to allow gay scouts into its troops , saying no youth would be denied membership " based on sexual orientation or preference alone			0
" the group maintained its ban on gay scout leaders , however			0
because of that ban , @entity107 announced last month it would end a program allowing its employees to steer corporate donations to the @entity1			2
@entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 have also ended partnerships with the scouts because of its policy , according to @entity55 and the @entity124			0
in a monday statement to @entity0 , the @entity1 said it does n't believe " the topic of sexual orientation has a role in scouting and it is not discussed unless it is deliberately injected into @entity80			2
" the organization also said it " does not have an agenda on the matter of sexual orientation ; we remain focused on working together to deliver the nation 's foremost youth program of character development and values - based leadership training			2
" the @entity20 is the @entity1 's second - largest chartered organization , accounting for more than 10,700 units and almost 350,000 members , according to the @entity1 website .			1
