editor 's note : @entity2 , an @entity3 priest , is professor of @entity5 religious history at @entity6 , @entity7 , and a visiting professor at @entity9			1
his most recent book is " @entity11 in the @entity12 : how @entity13 shaped the @entity14 from @entity15 to @entity16			0
" @entity2 supports @entity18 's unusual broadening of a president 's words to include nonbelievers			1
@entity22 ( @entity23 ) -- president @entity18 's mention of " nonbelievers " in his inaugural address represents an important broadening of the circle of acceptability in @entity5 life , an acknowledgement of our growing diversity and a fuller embrace of the principles articulated in our nation 's charter documents			1
one of the hallmarks of @entity5 life , dating to the 17th century , is its religious pluralism			0
the @entity42 seaboard during the colonial period was home to everyone from @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 to @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , mennonites and @entity56			0
jews arrived in @entity58 in 1654 , refugees from @entity60 after the @entity62 takeover of @entity63			1
somehow it all worked , especially in the crucible of religious pluralism in the @entity67 : @entity22 , @entity68 and @entity69 , where @entity70 launched his " @entity71 " of religious toleration			0
in the context of the @entity75 , these religious groups learned to coexist with remarkably little conflict , and when it came time to configure the new nation , the founders in their wisdom elected not to designate any group as the state religion			2
" @entity85 shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , " the @entity83 to the @entity84 reads			1
this provision set up a kind of free market for religion in @entity60 , allowing religious groups to compete in a marketplace unfettered by government interference			1
indeed , @entity5 history is littered with religious entrepreneurs ( to extend the economic metaphor ) who have peddled their wares in this marketplace and thereby contributed to the vigor and vitality of @entity5 religious life			0
the story of religion in @entity60 life has been one of expansion and ever - increasing diversity			1
although @entity47 were present in the colonial period -- @entity112 , named for the wife of @entity114 , was founded by @entity47 from @entity115 -- @entity47 arrived in great numbers from @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 over the course of the 19th century			0
many protestants , their hegemony threatened , resisted , sometimes with violence			0
jews from @entity118 and @entity125 came as well			0
most of the resistance was episodic			0
with notable -- albeit unfortunate -- exceptions , we @entity128 eventually rise to our better selves and embrace the principles of equality and toleration enshrined in our charter documents			0
and we can trace these changes in our rhetoric			2
the term " @entity139 , " although coined late in the 19th century , became popular in the 1930s as the clouds of war were gathering in @entity125			0
in 1955 , after @entity146 , when so many sons of @entity124 and @entity145 immigrants fought the @entity147 , sociologist @entity148 published a book entitled " @entity150 , " arguing that any of these religious expressions was legitimately " @entity5			1
" the following decade saw still more changes			0
the civil rights struggle brought the vibrancy of @entity5 religious life to national attention , and @entity158 's signature on the @entity159 in 1965 removed immigration quotas			2
in the decades since , the arrival of people from around the world , especially from @entity164 and @entity165 , has literally recast the religious landscape of the @entity128			0
@entity168 mosques , @entity170 temples , @entity171 and @entity173 stupas have sprouted across the nation , from cities to the countryside			1
and our rhetoric has evolved as well			2
whereas @entity60 might once have been described as a " @entity150 " nation and then a " @entity139 " nation ( to reflect the inclusion of @entity47 ) , we moved to " @entity139 " and then " @entity150			1
" more recently , we have talked about the " @entity182 , " @entity124 , @entity183 and @entity168 , thereby broadening the circle to include @entity185 , one of the three major monotheistic religions			1
even with this broadening landscape , however , presidents have generally acknowledged only believers and failed to mention atheists or agnostics			0
our rhetoric , in fact , has always lagged behind our reality			2
when president @entity18 declared , " we are a nation of @entity183 and @entity168 , @entity124 and @entity170 and nonbelievers , " he sent a signal that it 's time , once again , to enlarge the circle of inclusiveness , consistent with the great @entity5 tradition of equality and toleration			1
although i 'm sure that @entity207 and @entity208 and @entity209 and countless other religious adherents would like to have been included in the president 's roll call , the message was clear : we are a diverse nation , and the " free exercise " of religion guaranteed in the @entity83 also protects the exercise of no religion at all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : it 's unusual for a president to include nonbelievers in his words
he says @entity60 has widened its circle of religion for hundreds of years
@entity2 says rhetoric has grown to include @entity124 , @entity168 , @entity170
the @entity83 makes it appropriate to recognize nonbelievers , he says
