@entity0 -- on the face of it , the disastrous oil spill in the @entity3 and the growing threat of a disabling cyber attack would seem to have little in common			1
but experts have warned @entity9 that the inability of government and industry to prevent or respond to a cyber threat could be equally disastrous			2
a critical report from the @entity16 's inspector general released wednesday concluded the agency responsible for protecting civilian computer and information networks was seriously understaffed and did not have the authority to order government agencies to protect their systems			1
former @entity16 official @entity23 told the @entity24 that the @entity26 oil spill should be a valuable lesson to those developing cyber-security strategy			2
" if we knew how bad things were , how many corners were cut before the oil spill , we would have demanded action on part of industry as well as the government			2
we know we face exactly that kind of crisis in the context of cyber security , " said @entity23			2
rep. @entity42 said it might even be worse			0
" we could have a broken network or networks , spewing tens of thousands of bits of information on critical infrastructure , national security and mission critical data , financial and personal data , etc. it could be as devastating or more devastating than the environmental catastrophe that 's unfolding on our tv sets , " said the @entity44 from @entity45 the number of cyber intrusions is growing dramatically			2
according to a @entity62 analysis , the number of security incidents reported by federal agencies increased more than 400 percent between 2006 and 2009			1
there were 278,000 indications of malicious activity per month targeting the civilian government cyber networks , @entity16 assistant secretary @entity63 told the committee			1
the @entity70 @entity69 ( @entity69 ) is the agency within @entity16 responsible for coordinating the government 's efforts to defend against and respond to cyber attacks against the government 's non-military systems			1
inspector general @entity76 said @entity70 - @entity69 does not have the authority to enforce its recommendations to federal agencies , impeding the government 's ability to move forward on cyber security			1
" until they have that authority or until they have mechanisms in place to ensure that compliance in fact is taking place , we 're going to continue to experience problems , " said @entity76			0
@entity63 acknowledged @entity16 does not have the authority to require a department or agency to correct a cyber vulnerability but when pressed by several lawmakers to identify what powers @entity16 needed , @entity63 would only say the administration is looking at the problem and did not have a position yet on specific authorities			1
the inspector general 's report criticized @entity70 - @entity69 for not being sufficiently staffed to carry out its mission			1
the agency is authorized to have 98 positions , but only 55 have been filled and 25 people are awaiting security clearances			0
committee chairman @entity111 , @entity112 , wanted to know why it will take two years to hire 80 people			0
@entity63 explained it is a difficult task because of competition within government and private industry for a very limited pool of highly skilled people			0
" these people are not easily found , " said @entity63			0
the inspector general 's report also cited another problem at @entity69 , the lack of sustained leadership			1
in the past five years , there have been four directors			0
another area of concern cited by the inspector general is the use of @entity132 , an intrusion detection software program developed by @entity69 and used to monitor federal computer networks			1
@entity76 said only 21 agencies have @entity132 installed in their infrastructure			0
" we need to put pressure on federal partners to start taking cyber security a lot more seriously and start using the tools we 've developed to help them secure their networks , communication systems and computers , " said the inspector general			1
committee chairman @entity111 wanted to know what could be done about complaints from federal agencies that @entity16 was not sharing enough of the data collected from @entity132 concerning possible security breaches			1
@entity76 said that is a complicated problem because a lot of the information is raw data and agencies may not have the capability to analyze it			0
assistant secretary @entity63 said @entity16 has a plan to expand the amount of information it shares with others , but it has to be done in a way that does n't violate classification rules			2
@entity63 also agreed with @entity76 that the high volume of raw data needs to be processed by highly skilled personnel who can analyze it and turn it into executable action			0
@entity76 said @entity70 - @entity69 has made a lot of progress in implementing a cyber-security program , specifically citing information - sharing with the public and private sectors and increasing the skills and expertise of its staff			0
but he said a lot more needs to be done			0
" the train has left the station			0
we are now chasing the problem instead of being ahead of it , " said @entity76			0
several @entity24 members on both sides of the aisle thought the bill introduced last week by sens. @entity194 of @entity195 , an independent who caucuses with the @entity197 , and @entity198 , @entity199 , would go a long way in getting the cyber security effort on track			2
that bill calls for a permanent @entity205 cyber security coordinator , creates a @entity206 within @entity16 to lead federal efforts to protect government and private networks , and gives the president emergency powers to protect systems under attack .			1

@entity62 : cyber-security incidents reported by federal agencies up 400 percent
new inspector general 's report critical of government 's ability to respond
@entity16 does not have authority to require fix on cyber vulnerability
@entity228 bill would give president emergency powers to protect systems under attack
