-- picture this : you 're charging down a course at 80 mph			0
the world whips by you in a blur			0
you catch an edge , smack into a gate and somersault into the safety nets , cracking your neck and shredding a knee			0
career ? definitely on hold , possibly kaput			0
that 's what happened in december to @entity17 , one of the @entity19 's top racers , during a downhill race at @entity22 's @entity21			1
he 's one of many international @entity24 competitors sidelined this winter because of season - ending injuries			1
other casualties include 2009 downhill champ @entity22 @entity29 and @entity31 slalom star @entity30			0
addressing the rash of early - season injuries , @entity34 , the 2009 men 's overall @entity35 winner , posted the following on his blog in december : " in two weeks of intense @entity35 racing in @entity39 , racers have sustained the following ... 7 torn @entity40 , 4 knee ligaments , 1 broken arm , 1 broken leg , 1 broken neck , 1 concussion , 1 dislocated knee , 1 dislocated shoulder			1
. is this ok ? " sure , ski racing has always been a dangerous sport , but with ever - evolving gear and technologies creating faster and faster competitors , the incidence of injuries has spiked			1
@entity0 : @entity56 's @entity13 skier , ready for glory the @entity58 ( known as @entity58 ) , the @entity35 governing body , launched the " @entity63 " in 2006 to track facts and figures on injury patterns across all disciplines : @entity64 , freestyle and @entity24			2
among @entity24 racers , knee injuries are the most common affliction			0
as a part of this initiative , in december @entity58 convened a panel of six top @entity24 competitors , including @entity72 , @entity73 , and @entity74 , to drill down on how to make racing safer			1
they cited course preparation , improved take - off points for jumps , flat landings and medical procedures as top concerns			1
@entity0 : @entity31 @entity13 uniforms : really pink the athletes also made a plea for redesigned gates , ones that would rip off more easily upon impact			1
in @entity17 's accident , they say this would have significantly reduced his injuries and their severity			1
while competitors want to increase safety , they 're also aware that it 's the danger , blood and guts of their sport that turn fans on , and athletes are wary of ratcheting down the visceral appeal			1
when it comes to modifying race procedures , @entity58 is adamant about using systematic data collection and scientific analysis to make informed decisions			2
in january , @entity58 rolled out a new , three - year scientific study to analyze @entity24 racing safety and to make recommendations on how to decrease the number of injuries			1
the first phase will collect information through interviews with athletes , coaches and equipment providers , among other experts , to gather suggestions for short - term prevention solutions			2
subsequent stages will focus on prevention strategies and rule changes			0
however , some modifications were deemed urgent enough to institute immediately : smaller jumps and new gates with flags that rip way upon contact			0
@entity58 works closely with the @entity131 to design the @entity24 courses at the @entity13 , but ultimately , it 's @entity131 that sets them -- save the downhill , which @entity58 still oversees ; it 's an old , complicated tradition			0
with fog rising from @entity137 during the downhill training runs , making visibility next to none , officials were scrambling to re-design the race gates in an effort to make them more visible , switching the flag color from green to red			2
with this last - minute change , officials on the ground were n't sure if the new , fis - sanctioned gates would be in place during the @entity150			2
