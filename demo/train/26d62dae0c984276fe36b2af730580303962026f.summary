@entity56 said you need to either find a way to understand and resolve the issues with your boss , or find a new job			2
consider these tips , too : 1 ) as an employee , make sure you are n't contributing to the problem			0
" when bosses ' judge ' that someone is not trustworthy they pull away , they do not offer them the best assignments or flexibility that they do others , " said @entity56			0

" if a supervisor does n't see you as competent and hardworking , they may treat you as not trustworthy -- and what you experience in return causes you to mistrust them , too , " said the career coach			1
3 ) keep a paper trail			0
@entity109 said if you feel there is a problem , document what is happening so you have something to provide your human resources department should the time come			0

not everyone has this kind of relationship with their boss , however , so you want to tread lightly and not lose a job that you 're not ready to leave , she said			1
5 ) if your boss is violating company policy , consider approaching human resources			1

you have to decide if this will jeopardize your job , and if so , decide if you can deal with those consequences , @entity109 said .			0
