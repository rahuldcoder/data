-- just when you think teen superstar @entity3 could n't possibly do anything dumber , he does something that makes you do a double face palm			1
@entity3 is truly achieving the impossible : he 's making @entity7 look good			1
so what did @entity3 do this time ? well , over the weekend he stopped at the @entity9 in @entity10			1
this museum is dedicated to preserving the memory of @entity13 , whose chronicle of her family 's efforts to hide from the @entity17 during @entity18 would later become " @entity19			2
" @entity3 ended his visit by writing in the @entity23 memorial 's guest book : " truly inspiring to come here			1
@entity13 was a great girl			0
hopefully she would have been a belieber			2
" for those who wonder what he 's talking about , a " belieber " is a term used to describe one of @entity3 's devoted fans			1
apparently @entity3 's take - away from visiting this @entity23 memorial was that he hoped that @entity13 would 've been a fan of his music			1
he may have just redefined the word " narcissistic			0
" there is a silver lining to this			0
some of his young fans tweeted that they had never heard of @entity13			2
consequently , the controversy surrounding his comments apparently raised awareness about the horrors of the @entity23 to some young people previously unfamiliar with it			1
and the @entity9 praised @entity3 's visit			1
but @entity3 really needs to stop talking for a while			1
and i do n't say that as someone who harbors an inappropriate amount of dislike for the teen singer			0
in fact , last may i wrote a piece for @entity0 defending and actually sympathizing with @entity3 when he had an altercation with the paparazzi			1
but that was almost a year ago			0
since then , @entity3 has become unbearable			1
in the last month alone , we have watched @entity3 caught on tape being restrained by his bodyguards as he unleashed a stream of obscenities and threatened members of the paparazzi with physical violence			2
he also allegedly spit in the face of one of his neighbors and threatened him after the neighbor complained that @entity3 was driving his @entity73 at 100 mph in their gated community			2
then we saw @entity3 storm out of his march birthday party like a spoiled child calling it the " worst birthday			2
" he went on to show up almost an hour late for his concert in @entity80			0
and in january , photos surfaced of @entity3 smoking what the website @entity83 said appeared to be weed with his friend rapper , @entity85			2
@entity3 wants the world to know he is n't a kid anymore			2
so he has decided to go the " bad ass " route			0
but @entity3 will never , ever be the tough guy he wants to be			1
why ? for starters , he 's @entity94			0
when you think @entity94 , you think nice , often overly polite people -- not thugs			0
second , @entity3 is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 130 pounds			2
those measurements say " horse jockey , " not scary guy			0
( sure , actor @entity101 is only 5 feet 4 inches tall and known as a tough guy , but @entity101 is @entity103 and was born in @entity104 , @entity105 , not @entity80 , @entity106			1
) @entity3 is clearly heading down the path of many child stars desperate to make the transformation into grown - up star			1
but his actions are not getting him there			0
instead , he is becoming a walking punch line			0
he has a few options			0
he could simply retire and enjoy his wealth			0
estimates are that he is worth more than $ 100 million			0
not bad for a 19 - year - old kid -- from @entity94			0
but it 's unlikely that @entity3 will take that route			1
the other option is to avoid the fate of past teen stars who have ended up behind bars or worse as they struggled toward adulthood			0
instead , he could follow the lead of another @entity3 : @entity126			1
he , too , was a young star			0
first on " the @entity128 " and then in the much better known boy band ' @entity127			0
@entity126 did n't try to be something he 's not			1
he continued to make music and then made a successful transition into acting			0
decision time is now for @entity3 : he can be a @entity126 or a cautionary tale that parents tell their kids who want to go into show business			1
what 's it going to be ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			1

@entity142 : at @entity9 , @entity3 said he hoped she would have been " belieber "
@entity142 : comment redefines narcissism , but on bright side , his fans learned of @entity23
he says in effort to show he 's a grown - up , @entity3 has been in *tailspin* of public *misbehavior*
@entity142 : @entity3 should take a page from @entity126 , forget about aim to be tough guy
