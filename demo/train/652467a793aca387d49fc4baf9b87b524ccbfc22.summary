-- when @entity2 sprinted to three gold medals at the 2007 world championships , it looked like the @entity5 would be athletics ' next superstar -- but that dream unraveled as another man emerged to conquer all			1
@entity11 was the name on everyone 's lips after the @entity15 the following year , when a hamstring injury meant @entity2 could only compete in the 100 meters -- and he did n't even reach the final			1
however , 2012 finds the 29 - year - old from @entity19 , @entity20 , in prime condition and ready to challenge @entity23 's world record - holder in @entity24 in august			1
@entity0 's human to hero series tracked down @entity2 as he prepares for battle with @entity11 in the @entity29 capital , having decided to focus on the 100m event in june 's @entity5 trials			1
starting out " i played football in high school , i played baseball when i was younger , things like that , but i think it was the passion i had for track where you want to do an individual sport and be the best , i think -- there 's nothing that can replace that			2
" gay 's promise on the track was clear from an early age , though it was n't until he had turned 14 that he could beat his older sister @entity50 , who he says has inspired him			2
he became a three - time 100m state champion at @entity53 and his time of 10.46 seconds in a 2001 state meeting remains a record			2
he was the first athlete in history from the @entity58 to claim a national college 100m title			0
heroes gay says an illustrious @entity5 quintet of @entity64 medal winners have proved an inspiration to his career			1
@entity67 and @entity68 , who share 13 olympic gold medals between them , are joined by the legendary @entity71 , who won four golds at the @entity73 of 1936			1
@entity74 , who won a gold and a silver in @entity77 in 1996 , and @entity78 , who secured two golds at @entity80 in 2000 , complete the list			1
" when i grew up @entity67 was still running , @entity78 was running -- he was that figure i see , like @entity68			1
i really wanted to look up to the fast guys -- so those two guys were some of the guys i looked up to			0
" in history class at school it was @entity71			1
you had to learn about him first before you got to @entity78 and those guys			1
" i do some training with @entity74 -- he 's given me a lot of great advice			0
he 'll text me sometimes to check how i 'm doing to see how an injury is going			2
that really means a lot to me			0
" @entity99 gay has never made an @entity64 final but is intent on breaking that run in @entity24 when , once again , 100m and 200m world record - holder @entity11 will be the man to beat			1
" this is my biggest games			0
i think this is me in my prime			0
i 'm gon na be fit and ready			0
i 'm gon na put everything into this one , " @entity2 said			2
" i really believe it 's going to be one of the most exciting olympics in history			0
i want to run with the best , that 's how i 've always lived			0
" basically , last year i ran on one leg and ran 9.7 seconds			2
i know i can be a lot more dangerous as long as i stay healthy and get a lot stronger in the weight room			0
" i have n't been to an @entity64 final yet , so i know it 's going to be a different type of atmosphere but i 'm thinking i can control it			1
" i 've really learned over the years how to control my adrenaline and let it all out when they shoot the gun versus letting the crowd and the lights and the camera get to me			0
" so i 'm thinking i can handle it , but i think i will be a little bit nervous			0
