-- a senior @entity2 police chief has a described an incident in which a man was tasered 14 times while in police custody as " unacceptable and extremely disappointing			1
" @entity8 footage of the incident , which happened in @entity9 , @entity10 in 2008 , showed an unarmed aboriginal man lying on the ground surrounded by police officers after reportedly refusing a strip search			1
the man survived the incident and was later shown the footage but declined to press charges			2
two of the officers involved were fined a $ 1,200 ( $ 1,149 ) and a $ 750 ( $ 718 ) respectively but kept their jobs after an internal inquiry			2
charges were dismissed against two other officers			2
" against all their training and procedures , two officers repeatedly tasered a detainee because he would n't move when told , and all this while other officers watched , " @entity24 acting commissioner @entity23 said in a statement			1
" the community will obviously be disappointed when they see closed - circuit television vision today of what took place , " he added			0
" they were fortunate not to be sacked			0
" taser guns emit an electrical current which temporarily immobilizes the victim by disrupting voluntary control of muscles			1
the disturbing footage was released as part of a report by the state 's @entity45 into the use of @entity49 guns by the force			1
it said tasers were used 3,070 times between 2007 and 2009 , becoming the " option of choice " representing 74 percent of reported uses of force in 2008			2
but it said this incident highlighted a " broader problem with respect to officers misunderstanding the circumstances in which @entity49 could be used			0
" as a result , the state 's attorney general called for police disciplinary procedures to be reviewed			0
" there has to be some recognition that excessive use of force with a taser is of a completely qualitatively different nature to just excessive use of force with your hands , if you like , " @entity67 was quoted by @entity68 as saying			0
" i think we 've reached the stage now where @entity49 are such important instruments for the police force that disciplinary proceedings for excessive use of force with a @entity49 need to be treated in a special category			0
" meanwhile , police in @entity88 are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death on saturday of a man who was tasered by officers called to investigate an alleged domestic incident			1
the man lost consciousness a short time afterwards and later died in hospital , @entity68 reported .			0
