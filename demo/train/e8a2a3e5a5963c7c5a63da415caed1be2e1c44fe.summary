the main character in @entity2 's new novel , " @entity3 , " is a @entity5 solider who becomes a self - made superhero			1
but all sgt. @entity7 really wants to be is " @entity8			0
" " @entity3 " is about geopolitics , environmental disaster and the 24 - hour news culture			1
but , at its core , @entity12 says " @entity20 " is a story about fatherhood and the " power of paternal and filial love			1
" it 's not your typical father - son story , says @entity2 , a married father of two and the son of legendary spy novelist @entity25			1
but , " something about the nature of guns and the similarities between being an @entity30 ( noncommissioned officer ) and a parent , " combined with revelations in the @entity5 press in 2010 about rendition , led @entity2 to start writing			1
the book deals with darker themes of justice and vengeance , similar to another hero with father issues , " @entity42			1
" despite the comic book overtones and its location on a fictional island scheduled by @entity47 for demolition , @entity2 says he tried to keep the story grounded in reality			1
in other words , no laws of physics are broken , he says			0
" it 's the most real , in a way , of the books i 've written			2
" after years of dodging enemy fire in @entity59 and @entity60 , the main character @entity7 is sent to the fictional island of @entity62 , a " spit of land " in the @entity65 , to serve as the last representative of her majesty 's government			2
on @entity62 , @entity7 meets a nameless , streetwise boy raised on comic books , action movies and video games			0
his self - taught @entity73 is a mish - mash of " leetspeak " -- the language of the elite -- riddled with pop - culture references and internet slang			2
most importantly , the boy may be an orphan			0
@entity7 is also a man without a family			0
when he and the boy bond over their mutual love of comic books and afternoon tea , @entity7 starts to imagine life as a father			1
@entity7 ' hopes bloom into a plan to adopt the boy ( if he 's willing ) and forge a future together			2
but the sergeant and the boy face a deadline for their would - be family			2
after years of ecological abuse , @entity62 has become an environmental disaster			0
@entity47 has earmarked the island for destruction			0
residents who can afford it are " leaving " with a capital " @entity104 " others are hanging on and facing eventual evacuation			0
with an end date looming , anarchy and lawlessness spread across the island , think @entity110 , only with " discharge clouds " of toxic pollution			0
when a group of gun - toting thugs kills a mutual friend , the boy inspires @entity7 to become " @entity20 , " part vigilante , part myth and " full of win , " as the boy says			1
the sergeant dons a homemade mask , body armor and utility belt to battle bad guys and hopefully convince the boy to become his son when the dust settles			0
comic book fans will recognize elements of the @entity42 , with @entity7 playfully referring to the boy as " @entity130 " in the book			0
@entity2 names " @entity132 " and " @entity133 " among his childhood favorites			1
but " @entity3 " is n't so much his version of " @entity42 " as it is his take " on me , or any of us , shoved into being a costumed hero , " he says			1
" @entity42 is one of a small number of characters who get the title ' superhero ' despite having no actual superpowers			2
although i 've heard it said that he has the best superpower of all , that of being ridiculously rich in a world where technology can make you a god			0
" @entity2 is the author of two previous genre - bending and critically - acclaimed novels , " the @entity153 " and " @entity154			1
" despite his famous lineage , he says he does n't pattern his work after his famous father			1
" we have n't spent a lot of time consciously talking about writing in a master - student kind of way , but we have similar concerns , ethical worries , ( and ) geopolitical perceptions in some areas			1
i like to think that my thought influences his in some areas , too			0
" for now , @entity2 is already at work on his next novel about " semiotics , murder , alchemy , sharks , banking , game design and the surveillance state , " he said			2
he 's also making time for fatherhood , something he describes as " the best , and the most extreme " adventure .			0
