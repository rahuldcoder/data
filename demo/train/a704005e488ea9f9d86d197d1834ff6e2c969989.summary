-- @entity2 drivers across the country are rejoicing at falling gasoline prices , but the world 's oil producers are understandably less thrilled at the drop in revenues			1
that discontent could devolve into something more serious : instability , and even unrest			2
and that , in turn , would drive prices back up , leaving no one feeling happy			2
this is a hard cycle to break			0
ultimately , there 's only one way out , and that 's to depend less on oil , for both producers and consumers			2
in the meantime , the @entity2 economy will just adjust to lower prices , even if that adjustment is painful for some companies and their investors			1
that may be true almost nowhere else in the world			2
a number of oil - producing countries may have trouble paying their bills if oil prices stay below a certain level			1
expert opinion generally puts that level between $ 80 and $ 100 per barrel , but given how much money goes missing in most oil - producing countries , it 's hard to be sure about that breaking point			1
no one really knows the price elasticity of corruption			2
in countries that are already experiencing unrest -- and unrest often goes hand in hand with oil wealth -- any shortfall could spell disaster			1
some producers are more vulnerable than others			0
@entity58 , for example , will be fine			0
the country has a fairly diverse economy , a well - run national oil company that plays by the rules , and a democratic government			1
@entity64 , like @entity58 , has a large sovereign wealth fund , which the country is actively using now to weather price volatility			2
there may even be a silver lining for the @entity2 in the case of some countries			1
for @entity76 and @entity77 , already feeling the bite of international sanctions , the domestic pressure that comes with low prices may prompt their leaders to be more accommodating in international negotiations			0
it 's the countries that are already in deep trouble , such as @entity84 and @entity85 , that are truly at risk			1
oil income has been propping up embattled central governments , but with less money to ensure political and popular support , and the ongoing assaults , these governments could fall			0
but there are other less obvious , but no less consequential , producers at risk			0
consider @entity96 , an important global supplier with the 26th largest gdp in the world			0
@entity96 should have everything going for it , but instead , the country ranks 153rd out of 187 countries in the @entity105 's human development index , rating low in everything from life expectancy to education			0
the nation 's highly corrupt energy sector is partly to blame			0
2015 is an election year for @entity96 , and if the unpopular president , @entity112 , lacks the patronage dollars to spread around and wo n't step aside , expect problems			0
@entity115 is not much better off			0
still an important trade partner for the @entity2 , the country 's oil production is in steady decline , even though @entity115 has the largest petroleum reserves in the world			1
the @entity123 era was tough on @entity115 's once - respected national oil company , featuring political purges and a devastating strike			1
if the increasingly decrepit energy sector can no longer bankroll social programs , that will roil an already unsettled population			0
energy subsidies to other @entity133 nations may well be the first thing to go , and @entity2 refiners will feel the bite , too			1
one of the top energy trading partners for the @entity2 , @entity138 , has seen its production drop by almost a quarter in the last decade			2
@entity138 's largest field , @entity142 , has long been in decline , and the national oil company lacks the technical expertise to drill new deepwater sites			0
the @entity148 government is currently shepherding through reforms that could change that picture , but lower prices could be a complication , given that 30 - 40 % of government revenues come from oil			1
all of this instability is bad news for @entity2 national security -- but also for the @entity2 consumer			1
this is the cruel full circle of the global oil market : unrest provoked by low oil prices in these countries can run prices back up			1
the @entity2 is still a net importer of petroleum , and even if that should change -- which is possible -- the @entity2 will remain tied to the global oil market			1
their crises will be our crises			0
so , while it 's nice to get the break at the gas pump and the economic benefits of an energy boom at home , the national security price of oil remains high			2
in the near term , the @entity2 should be doing everything it can to diversify global energy suppliers , including allowing exports of @entity2 crude oil			1
in the long term , the only way out is a sustained , long - term investment in the alternatives to petroleum			0
this is a critical but not a quick fix , given the scale of global oil consumption and the technological challenges involved			0
it would help to be strategic and consistent in these investments : innovation in the transportation sector is especially important , for example , given its near - total dependence on oil			2
of course , if the @entity2 succeeds in energy innovation , that will in itself be destabilizing for other oil - producing countries			1
ultimately , the only way out is for them is to diversify their economies and promote good governance and rule of law for their energy sector			0
that is something they have to do for themselves , but the @entity2 should do everything it can to press , persuade , and support such reforms as a matter of national security , no matter how much oil we produce at home			1
join us on @entity222 / @entity221 .			0

oil prices have dropped *sharply* around the world , easing gasoline costs for @entity2 drivers
@entity229 : be *careful* what you wish for ; lower prices can have a *downside*
she says they could *foster* instability in nations like @entity84 and @entity85 that are dependent on oil
@entity241 : some oil - producing countries could have trouble paying bills if price stays below $ 80
