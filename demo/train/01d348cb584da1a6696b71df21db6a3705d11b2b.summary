-- ahh , summer -- a time of sun - drenched picnics where one partakes in three - legged races , whimsical games of croquet and copious pours of wine ( the sweet nectar sucked from the recesses of paper bags so as to avoid the long arm of @entity12 , of course )			1
and everyone knows that those picnics will fade into foggy , watercolor memories if not obsessively documented			0
while a lucky few of us have a trusty photog friend who 's always on hand to snap golden - hued pictures of our glorious glory days , others must rely on another , more mechanical companion for our photo - grabbing needs : one 's smartphone			1
thankfully , there are scads of photo - taking and sharing apps out there that are sure to get more play this summer than that chick over there in the @entity36 crop top			1
some are , shall we say , more exhibitionist than others ( like the aforementioned chick )			0
here 's our take on four apps for everyone from rabid shutterbugs to shut - ins			1
for storytellers are you one of those people who comes into work every monday with winding tales about driving out into the desert and communing with the cacti about fourth - dimensional time shifts as your friends dance in a daisy chain and the sun sets gorgeously in the background ? well , now you can document every leg of your spiritual journey with a new app for @entity62 and @entity63 called @entity64 , which allows you create stories with photo , video and audio			2
you can then share those multimedia tales via @entity71 , @entity72 and e-mail , so that your work friends can experience your transcendent weekend ( or laugh at your cactus convo ) right along with you			0
for voyeurs ever wonder what your neighbors are up to at those swingin ' hot tub party @entity79 they 're always throwing ? well , put down the binoculars and download color , a photo / video - sharing app for @entity62 ( and @entity84 , soon ) that allows you to see photos and videos from other users in your vicinity			1
there 's no " friending " on color -- you 're just shown pictures taken by people you hang out with on a regular basis ( determined via location technology )			0
we can see the app being a standby at many a festival this summer ( it was already featured at the @entity97 in @entity98 ) -- especially for those concert - goers crammed in the back behind lumbering show ogres			2
still , every pic on @entity82 is public , so if you plan on snapping some sexy shots of you and your honey behind the bandstand , uh , you might want to use a point - and - shoot			1
for socialites if every @entity71 notification sends a thrill shooting through your deepest core , @entity108 will likely bring you to crisis			0
@entity113 is basically a photo - sharing social network , which allows you to follow other users and comment on and " favorite " their snaps -- in which everyone is beautiful and ' 70sesque thanks to a cadre of flattering filters			1
yeah , that sunset is rad , but would n't it be radder if five people affirmed its beauty by tossing you a " like " ? do n't have an @entity62 ? @entity129 is pretty darn similar to @entity113			2
for @entity130 not everyone is big into sharing their lives with the whole block -- gossiping on front stoops as night falls , or finding out the latest neighborhood news from @entity137 at the diner			0
no , some of us would rather divulge our secrets to a particular group of friends -- you know , like your model train enthusiasts society , or your historical reenactment club			0
@entity148 , an @entity62 photo / video app that only allows you to share snaps with up to 50 friends ( within the app and on @entity71 ) , @entity153 the figure stems from the work of @entity157 psychologist @entity156 , who says that humans can only handle maintaining relationships with up to 150 people			0
because , let 's face it , you probably do n't have more than 50 pals who would be down to check out snaps from that recreation of the @entity165 you 're planning on staging down at @entity166 this summer .			2

there are scads of photo - taking and sharing apps that deserve some play this summer
