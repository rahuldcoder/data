the worst possible outcome for the country from the impasse over the continuing resolution that would prevent a government shutdown would be for @entity5 to cave			1
this is a pivotal conflict that will define the relationship between @entity10 and the executive branch for the next three years			0
the country will be much better off if @entity10 does not abdicate its constitutional role and if the president can not ignore that role			0
when president @entity17 is willing to negotiate with @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 leaders but unwilling to negotiate with the @entity23 @entity22 , it is time for the @entity22 to stand firm			1
when @entity34 majority leader @entity33 says , according to unnamed sources quoted in @entity26 , that he will refuse to attend a negotiation at the @entity29 because @entity22 @entity30 have to cave and surrender to his terms , it is time to stand firm			1
when a senior , unnamed @entity38 official is quoted monday morning calling for no negotiations and saying " it 's time to punch the bully in the nose , " it is time to stand firm			0
@entity44 : bet on @entity17 in shutdown showdown when @entity17 spends a week making three partisan speeches attacking @entity30 and then calls house speaker @entity49 to tell him , " i will not negotiate , " it is time to stand firm			1
it is a sad commentary on @entity17 's attitude toward the elected majority of the @entity22 that he could have a more pleasant conversation with the head of the @entity21 dictatorship than with the elected leader of the @entity22			1
the left has sold itself on a false history of the 2012 election			0
according to the left , @entity17 won the election and therefore we should do whatever he wants			1
this ignores that there was also an election for the " @entity68 " in 435 congressional districts , and the @entity5 won			0
it also ignores the 63 million @entity23 who voted against his re-election and his agenda			2
winning 52 % does not mean he gets 100 % of what he wants			0
@entity76 : government shutdown threat is getting very old , very fast the president has decided to seek to bully and bluff his way to get what he wants			0
@entity22 republicans must not abdicate their responsibilities now			1
any surrender on the continuing resolution would confirm the contempt with which @entity17 and @entity33 already hold @entity49 and his @entity30 colleagues			1
this fight is about something much bigger than the @entity30 and the future of @entity90			2
it is about whether the president dictates to @entity23 's elected representatives or negotiates with them when they disagree			2
it will be very bad for @entity23 if a president whose hubris is astounding is reinforced in the belief that he can bully his way into getting everything he wants by making demagogic attack speeches			0
the next few weeks might be painful if @entity22 @entity30 insist on getting to a compromise and refuse to surrender			1
but the next three years will be frightening if @entity102 cave and the president learns that nothing stands between him and his ability to use overweening power outside the @entity106 to advance his ideology			0
this is a big moment of decision for @entity23			0
do n't give in now .			2

@entity111 : worst possible outcome on *budget* showdown would be if @entity30 *backed* down
he notes @entity17 willing to negotiate with @entity21 , @entity19 and @entity20 but not with @entity30
he says getting elected does not give @entity17 free rein to *enforce* his agenda on the unwilling
@entity120 : if @entity22 caves , it will confirm contempt @entity17 and @entity33 hold for republicans
