the sons of at least three government ministers , the head of a public bank , several bureaucrats and high - profile businessmen were detained by @entity8 police tuesday as part of a sweeping corruption probe , state - run media reported			1
analysts called the move a signal of the growing rift within prime minister @entity16 's ruling party ahead of local elections in the spring			1
the detentions came after a two - year probe by the @entity20 into allegations of corruption including money laundering , gold smuggling and bribery , according to the semi-official @entity27 news agency			0
police carried out dawn raids in @entity30 and @entity31 , according to local media , including the headquarters of @entity34 , a public bank that was alleged to play a role in sidelining sanctions on @entity37 in a gold - for - oil scheme last year			0
the sons of interior minister @entity40 , economy minister @entity41 and @entity42 and urban planning minister @entity43 were detained in the raids , according to local media			0
the head of a large construction company , @entity48 , was also brought in within the scope of the investigation , though the ceo of the company later told @entity53 that @entity48 was not the focus of the investigation			0
local commentators and analysts see the raids as the most public confirmation of the developing rift between @entity16 's ruling party and supporters of @entity63 , an @entity64 cleric living in @entity65 whose loose network of followers are thought to hold key positions within the judiciary and police force			1
the @entity71 , the name preferred by @entity63 's followers , has in the past thrown its support behind the ruling @entity76 , or @entity76 , led by @entity16 , but the two have been publicly at odds over the last month			1
" it was a forced marriage and now it 's an ugly divorce , " said @entity79 , a journalist who wrote a book on @entity63 and his influence within the judiciary and the police force			0
last month , @entity16 announced that he would shut down college admission tutorial centers , a large source of revenue and recruitment opportunity for the @entity88			2
on monday , @entity89 -- a former footballer and @entity63 follower who was elected to parliament on the @entity76 party ticket -- resigned from the party , citing the government 's stance on tutorial centers			2
" this is all a judicial process , it would not be right for me to say anything until the outcome , " @entity16 told reporters in @entity98			0
but in a fiery speech he delivered there he said " those who are receiving the support of financial circles and media can not change the direction of this country			2
those who are supported by dark circles from inside and outside the country can not change the direction of @entity8			1
" @entity8 is expected to hold local elections in 2014 and many analysts see this as a test of @entity16 's grip on power after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests .			1
