@entity0 , @entity1 -- proclaiming " i am a soldier for the @entity1 revolution , " a @entity1 intelligence agent said friday he has no regrets about the spying that landed him in @entity10 prisons for more than a decade			1
" i felt that it was the right thing to do , " @entity11 said during a press conference in @entity0			1
@entity11 was a member of the so - called " @entity14 , " a network of agents in @entity17 that the @entity1 government said was gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks against @entity1			1
@entity10 federal prosecutors called the network a dangerous undercover spy cell			2
the men were convicted in 2001 and ever since have been the focus of an international campaign by @entity1 officials to free them			2
@entity11 was released from prison in october 2011 but was required to serve three years probation in the @entity10			1
last week , however , @entity10 judge @entity30 ruled that if @entity11 , who had already been allowed to temporarily return to @entity1 for his father 's funeral , could stay there provided he renounce his @entity10 citizenship			1
in her ruling @entity35 wrote that federal prosecutors had said @entity11 would be less of a security risk to the @entity10 if he returned to @entity1			1
previously , prosecutors had argued that @entity11 should not be allowed to go back to @entity1			2
on friday , @entity40 showed off a certificate issued by the @entity42 that confirmed he had renounced his @entity10 citizenship			1
despite the reversal by federal authorities , @entity11 said his early return to @entity1 did not demonstrate a thawing of @entity10 - @entity1 relations			1
" this was no humanitarian gesture , " he said			0
" this was a decision we forced the @entity10 government to take			0
the only option they had was to look worse			0
" @entity11 's comments did not bode well for jailed @entity42 contractor @entity56 , who was sentenced in 2011 to a 15 - year prison for importing banned communications equipment to @entity1			2
last year , @entity1 officials said @entity56 might be freed if the @entity10 made a " humanitarian gesture " and agreed to negotiations over the five imprisoned @entity1 agents			1
@entity10 officials have dismissed the possibility of talks , saying @entity56 did not spy against @entity1			0
born in the @entity10 to pro-castro @entity1 parents , @entity11 returned with them to @entity1 where he became an experienced pilot			1
@entity11 said before leaving for the @entity10 , he was told by government officials that he could still back out of the mission			2
" i was told first of all that it was a voluntary assignment , " he said			0
" no one forced me in any way			0
i felt that it was the right thing to do			0
" @entity11 later flew with the @entity1 exile group @entity75 , which scoured the @entity76 by small plane looking for @entity1 rafters			0
in 1996 , four members of the group were killed after their planes were shot down by @entity1 military aircraft as the group 's planes flew towards the island to drop anti-government leaflets			0
federal prosecutors argued that information supplied by the @entity14 agents assisted in the downing of the planes			0
" some times when i would fly with them and they would manifest their resentment , " @entity11 said friday			0
" i would daydream to myself that i was the first @entity96 ( @entity98 ) pilot to land a plane in the @entity10			0
" @entity11 said he will now dedicate himself to bringing back to @entity1 the four other still - incarcerated agents .			1

@entity11 spent years in @entity10 prisons after being convicted in 2001
he was a member of the so - called " @entity14 " network of @entity1 agents
now back in @entity0 , he has renounced his @entity10 citizenship as a @entity10 judge required
" i am a soldier for the @entity1 revolution , " @entity11 *declares* at a news conference
