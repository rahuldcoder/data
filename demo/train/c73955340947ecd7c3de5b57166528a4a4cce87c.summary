-- ten years after last voicing @entity4 leader @entity2 on the original " transformers " animated series , @entity1 decided to go to his first fan convention , @entity8 , in @entity9 , @entity10 , after some coaxing from his daughter			1
" i was taken aback by the response and the sheer love that was in the audience , " he said			2
" it became quite evident that ( voicing this character ) was a responsibility that i wanted to fulfill			1
i had no idea he was so popular			2
" that 1997 convention was the first of many for @entity1 , who said that @entity2 ' influence over the lives of children made the character his favorite			1
" it 's been wonderful to listen to the experience of growing up and how the character affected their lives in a good , positive way			1
it 's a joy to know that i made a difference			2
" so , why all the adoration ? " @entity2 is basically a bulletproof @entity41 , " said ireporter and " transformers " toy collector @entity38			1
" ( he 's ) someone so competent , virtuous and level headed that you trust him more than yourself			2
to kids he represents the perfect father figure , someone who is strong in every way and holds the best interests of others above those of himself , " @entity38 said			2
" @entity2 is capable , loyal , forgiving , just , approachable , a brilliant strategist , merciful , selfless , " said @entity52			1
" @entity2 can do no wrong			1
he ca n't even stay dead			2
if you ever needed a leader you 'd want him to be @entity2			1
" ten years after that first convention , @entity1 was asked to voice @entity2 in the first of the wildly popular " @entity40 " movie series , something for which he gives full credit to the fan base			1
this summer , he is playing the character in the third film , " transformers : @entity68 , " as well as the new animated series on the @entity70 , " transformers : prime			1
" " it was very important to me that he voice the character of @entity2 in the movie , " said @entity72 , who like @entity38 and @entity52 often check sites like seibertron.com to interact with other fans and find out the latest " transformers " news			1
" i believe he gives the character a better sense of humanity			2
" like classic characters @entity86 and @entity87 , the voice of @entity2 is instantly recognizable for a certain generation			1
" you know it 's him when you hear the voice , " said @entity52 , who added that despite his disappointment in the movies overall , the highlight is hearing @entity1 's performance			1
@entity38 described @entity1 's voice as " a perfect balance between warmth and authority			1
" @entity1 said he is personally touched by how strong the response has been			1
" i remember an officer in the @entity105 who had just returned from @entity106 , and he gave me his golden anchor emblem from his officer 's hat , " he said			1
" he presented that to me and said this is how much you mean to me			2
there are no words to describe it , but i was humbled			2
that sticks with me forever			2
" @entity1 -- who said that police officers have made similar gestures toward him -- came up with the voice because of his brother @entity120 , an officer in the @entity105			1
" i saw a difference in him when he came home			2
there was a maturity and calmness and understanding , and a very strong source of confidence , respect , caring and dignity , " he said			0
" i was called to audition and said goodbye to @entity120 , and i said i was auditioning for a hero			1
he said , ' be tough enough to be gentle , you do n't have to always be loud			0
' it stuck with me when i read the character description			2
i just echoed @entity120 's voice in the first few lines , and fell right into it			1
and i thought , boy , this feels like home			0
" when the producers of " transformers : prime " began casting , they knew that it was very important to get @entity1 to play @entity2 once again ... and along with that , they felt strongly that they needed to get the original @entity146 , @entity147 , as well			1
" those two guys love each other , " said executive producer @entity149			0
" they 're so obviously happy together that you get better stuff from the cast			0
that stamp of approval on what we were doing went a long way with the fan community , as well			0
" @entity1 said that he and @entity147 go back to the 1979 saturday morning cartoon , " @entity166 and @entity167 , " about a miniature superhero and a dog so ugly he had to cover his face with a dog house			1
" he played the dog , and i played @entity170 man , " he said			0
" now , sometimes we wo n't see each other for a while , but we 'll inevitably end up in the same studio together and reinforce our great appreciation for each other			0
" that camaraderie extends to younger members of the " prime " cast , as well			0
" the most surprising thing is being in the room with @entity1 and @entity147 and all of these guys whose careers i 've followed for so long and the fact that they were still so excited to be there , and so grateful after all these years -- especially @entity1 , he 's done it all , and he 's like a little kid in there and just as excited as we are , " said @entity180 , who plays the villainous @entity181			1
" he 's not the huge man you would expect him to be listening to his voice			2
he 's a normal size guy , but he opens his mouth and it 's almost as though the jaw would unhinge and the windows start to flex with all the vibrations coming out			0
" on the flip side from @entity2 ' heroism , anime veteran @entity180 explores the darkness of @entity181 while getting into character			1
" i just go as dark and delusional as i possibly can and sort of build my way up from there , " he said			0
" sprinkle in a little deviant and cowardly and megalomaniacal and i think from moment to moment , he 's one or all of those things			0
" " he 's a villain that is so completely out for himself that it actually works against him , " said @entity38 , who counts @entity181 as his favorite " @entity40 " character			2
" you never know if he 's going to follow @entity146 's plan against the @entity4 , or try to off @entity146 and take control of the @entity219 himself			0
" between good and evil , @entity180 is somewhat on the fence as to which he prefers			0
" the villains are certainly therapeutic			0
i get to act out all the badness that i am not really allowed to do in my day to day life , " he said			0
" but i like the heroes too , i do like setting a good example for kids once in a while instead of turning them into demented monsters			0
they both have their charm , but i would say more days than not , the villain is more fun to play			0
" not surprisingly , @entity1 feels differently : " i played a villain - @entity232 in ' @entity233 ' - and i got some feedback that it was pretty scary			1
i 'm not the kind of guy that likes to scare people			0
if it 's going to have an entertaining value , it 's got to be funny or inspiring			0
the evil part of it is part of the acting generator but it 's not one of my favorites			0
" one burning question for both actors : do they own action figures of themselves ? " i used to have @entity40 figures , and i think i broke them because i played with them too much , " said @entity180			0
" i have the original @entity253 figure ( from the 1980s ) , " said @entity1			1
" i even broke a portion trying to configure it -- it ended up on a shelf where it remains in pieces , several pieces i might add			0
nonetheless , it 's quite important to me , it was my first one and i cherish it			0
" nowadays , @entity1 keeps the figures in a closet , to bring out during birthdays and holidays for his grandson			1
" i love the 18 wheeler that transforms and speaks at the same time			0
i was knocked out by that one			0
he will get that at @entity272			0
" true enough , " @entity40 " transcends generations , as @entity1 has seen for himself			1
" my grandson is turning five in august and we were at dinner at a pizza house several days ago			0
he got up on his chair standing next to his dad and said ' i 'm @entity2 ! , ' and i just dropped ! he 's into ' transformers : prime ' and it just made my heart swell			1
that was a total surprise -- it knocked me out			0
