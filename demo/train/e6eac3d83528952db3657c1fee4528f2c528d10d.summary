when the global financial crisis struck in 2008 , markets across the world reeled , the housing market turned on its side , redundancies were rampant and the investment landscape transformed overnight			0
as banks turned off the taps on loans , budding entrepreneurs without a track record had to find new ways to raise capital to fund growth			0
along came crowdfunding , which allowed the power of people to finance projects			2
as a return on their investments , these so - called crowdfunders gained an equity stake , and often a sense of pride from having financed something they believe in			2
anyone who has an idea for a creative concept can post it on a website and ask backers to fund it , whether it be a new product , gadget or artistic project			2
highly - connected , mobile and flexible , the crowdfunding model can react to change faster than traditional companies			1
@entity37 recently visited @entity39 - based start - up @entity38 , which turned to the crowds for financing its secure personal servers which are produced onsite			1
" we said ok , this is what we 're going to do			0
we 're going to take our story and our vision of what we believe the future should look like , and tell it to the crowd and see what happens , " explained @entity45 , founder of @entity38 , to @entity37 's @entity46 at the company 's office			2
what happened next ? in less than an hour and a half , @entity38 had raised $ 1 million			0
" it 's a profit - sharing agreement , so if we get big and have huge success , which we 'll hopefully have , you 'll be a part of that			1
plus , you also get one of our latest products , " said @entity45			2
@entity38 's crowdfunding accounts for about 65 % of its total investment			0
" i believe that in the future we will see companies that are 100 % crowdfunded , " added @entity45			0
@entity68 taps into an online community with the goal of generating small contributions from large numbers of people			1
the dilemma for the crowdfunding industry ahead is to sort out the level of risk involved , who companies are actually marketing to and who they want to invest in their platforms , said @entity83 , head of investment research for @entity85 " so the future is interesting			0
there 's a need for funding but you 've got this issue of risk and the levels of investment that have to be solved , " @entity83 told @entity87			1
it 's an industry that is finding its feet , but some believe that the crowdfunding approach will have a place in how businesses are funded in the future			0
" if you look at how start - ups were financed before , many of them raised 100,000 euros through friends and family which is like crowdfunding , " said @entity103 , chairman of the @entity104			1
" so this is bringing this to the digitalized world , the tools that we have into the public , and i think this is what is driving the change , " said @entity103 , who forecasts that many entrepreneurs ahead may first have a round of business angel funding and then move on to crowdfunding to help reap the benefits of marketing while also raising capital			1
while @entity38 celebrates another sale of one of its servers , the small @entity129 start - up thinks the crowd could become a powerful force in finance			1
" i think it 's going to be an earthquake , and i believe it 's going to fundamentally change the way things are funded , " said @entity45 .			0

new products and gadgets are posted online , seeking backers for funding
