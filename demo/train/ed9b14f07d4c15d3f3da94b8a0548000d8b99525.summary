a federal judge in @entity1 , @entity2 , has ordered the @entity3 to make the morning - after birth control pill available to people of any age without a prescription			1
the order overturned a 2011 decision by @entity11 secretary @entity10 to require a prescription for girls under 17			1
the @entity3 said it could n't comment on an ongoing legal matter			0
but the @entity15 indicated an appeal of the ruling was under consideration			1
" the @entity15 is reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly , " department spokeswoman @entity19 said			1
the @entity21 recommended last year that oral contraceptives be sold over the counter in an effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the @entity27			0
opponents of prescription requirements say prescriptions can delay access to the drug			0
in 2011 , @entity33 , maker of @entity35 one - step , had asked the @entity3 to make the drug available without prescription to all sexually active girls and women			2
@entity10 overruled the @entity3 's recommendation , saying , " i do not believe enough data were presented to support the application			1
" on friday , @entity27 district court judge @entity43 said in his order , " the decisions of the secretary with respect to @entity35 one - step and that of the @entity3 with respect to the @entity48 , which it had no choice but to deny , were arbitrary , capricious , and unreasonable			1
" friday 's order came in response to a lawsuit launched by the @entity57			1
the group was seeking to expand access to all brands of the morning - after pill over the counter , such as @entity35 one - step and @entity64 , so that women of all ages would be able to purchase them without a prescription			1
" today science has finally prevailed over politics , " @entity68 , the center 's president and ceo , said in a statement			2
" this landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep - seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods			1
" in a press briefing , @entity80 said that according to the order , within 30 days , the pill would be available over the counter without " point of sale restrictions , " such as needing to show identification or being a certain age			1
there may be other settings besides drugstores where the morning - after pill will be sold , @entity92 , associate professor at the @entity94 's @entity93 and @entity95 , told reporters			1
" we no longer have to find , on a sunday morning or a saturday night , an open pharmacy counter with a pharmacist on duty , " she said			2
the @entity103 also supported the decision , applauding the stance that " science should guide policy			2
" but other groups , including the @entity109 , expressed concerns about the order			2
" there is a real danger that @entity35 may be given to young girls , under coercion or without their consent			0
the involvement of parents and medical professionals act as a safeguard for these young girls			0
however , today 's ruling removes these common - sense protections , " @entity122 , director of the organization 's @entity123 , said in a statement			1
@entity128 of the @entity129 also disagreed with the ruling , citing what he sees as a " contempt shown for parental rights			0
" " a 12 - year - old girl in a @entity2 school can not be given an aspirin by her teacher , even if she has a fever			2
the same girl can not buy a large soda during lunchtime because mayor @entity142 has decreed that it is not good for her			0
but she can be given a pill , unbeknownst to her parents , that could arguably abort her baby , " he said in a statement			2
the @entity3 approved @entity35 in 1999			0
the key ingredient in @entity35 is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel			0
this drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary , or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm			0
if there has been fertilization , @entity35 may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus			0
but if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus , the morning - after pill will not work			1
emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours			0
many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives , including @entity169 and most of @entity170 , but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally			0
a 2012 study in the journal @entity176 found that there is misinformation about emergency contraception , including about what age women can obtain it without a prescription , and who can take it in general			0
as far as pricing , the morning - after pill goes for about $ 50 , said @entity186 , interim president and ceo of @entity188 .			1
