-- i have no idea why my 3 - year - old wants to be a cowboy for @entity5 this year , because she wo n't tell me			1
i do n't need to know her reasoning to make it happen			1
thanks to her outdoorsy grandparents who live in the @entity16 mountains , we already have the cowboy hat and handkerchief			0
we found a great pair of overalls on sale for $ 1.69 at the local @entity23 store			0
but we still needed a cowboy jacket , a flannel shirt and boots			0
and whatever else might make her look like a 3 - foot version of a cowboy			1
entering a temporary @entity5 store that popped up in our town , i headed to the kids ' costume section			1
the little girls ' costumes seemed odd to me -- so many little skirts attached to superheroes and vampires			1
even if i could find a cowgirl costume among all the girly - girl stuff , my girl would probably find a cowgirl skirt pointless			1
how would she ride her toy horse with a skirt ? sidesaddle ? as i turned toward to the boys ' section to continue the search for accessories , i saw the costume that scared me more than any vampire or ghost : the little black dress			1
posed seductively like a brown - haired version of @entity56 , the child model on the package looked 4 or 5 years old			1
i could n't imagine the photographer asking that little girl to pose that way			0
previously on @entity0 : parents , do n't dress your girls like tramps americans are expected to spend $ 1 billion on children 's costumes this year , up from $ 840 million last year , according to a @entity70 survey			1
from my limited scan of @entity5 costumes on sale this year , sexy costumes for younger girls are flooding the marketplace			1
many women i know have that little black dress , a somewhat slinky number that could be a cocktail dress or a basis for a suggestive black cat			0
but a grown woman makes a choice to dress in such a sexually suggestive outfit for @entity5 or any other night of the year			1
she knows a sexy dress is going to garner a different reaction than @entity87 , but she can take precautions to stay safe from the weirdos			0
a child has no idea what 's going on			1
" the message to our girls ( with these costumes ) is that they ca n't be too sexy , and they ca n't be sexy too soon , " says @entity93 , founder of @entity94 , a clothing line for adventurous girls , who has blogged about sexy @entity5 costumes			1
there 's nothing sexual about her			0
" it can also be dangerous			0
" dressing girls like grown women for @entity5 communicates that they have the sexuality of adults , in the bodies of children , " says @entity108 , an assistant professor of sociology at @entity110			1
" while little girls themselves likely have very little awareness of adult or even adolescent sexuality , or what sex is really about , the adults who are seeing them on the streets do			2
we are also communicating to adults that little girls are sexually appealing , and this message has tragic implications for their vulnerability to sexual abuse			2
" the sexualizing of @entity5 costumes for young girls is part of a larger marketing trend emphasizing girls ' outsides over their insides , says @entity141 , founder of the @entity142 , featuring superhero @entity143 on t - shirts and in a new book			1
" marketers basically decide what is ' girl ' and what is ' boy , ' which ultimately leads to two very distinct ways to profit as well as a blind acceptance from the consumer who , often , does n't realize it 's happening , " @entity141 says			0
" girls are inundated from a very young age with inappropriate messaging by way of products like ' skinny ' jeans for toddlers , or t - shirts that say , ' i 'm too pretty to do homework , so my brother does it for me , ' and sexy @entity5 costumes			1
kids begin to codify other kids by placing them in strict categories that they 've been taught -- not born with			0
inevitably , kids begin to believe that girls need to be sexy , and boys believe it , too			2
" what girls hear is who they are is how they look , and how they have to look is " hot , " which is creating problems for girls at an ever - younger age , says @entity183 , author of " @entity184 : dispatches from the @entity186 of the @entity187			1
" " girls are learning at the youngest ages that their value comes from how they look , and the definition of attractive is very narrowly defined as being sexy or sassy ( for the younger girls ) , " @entity183 says			2
" sexuality is imposed upon them inappropriately , and they are encouraged to define their bodies -- not by how their bodies feel to themselves , but by how they look to others			0
this creates vulnerabilities for girls to the pitfalls we worry about -- distorted body image , eating disorders , depression and unhealthy sexual behavior			2
" @entity208 of @entity209 , @entity210 , has given up on store - bought costumes for her kids after ordering a @entity214 costume that turned out to be less than she had bargained for			1
although it was supposedly the correct size for her 10 - year - old daughter , " the shirt was tight and the skirt was miniscule , barely covering her rear end			0
" " i was thinking how embarrassed i would be to have her walk around in that costume , and she was embarrassed as well , " @entity220 says			2
" dressing up as a sexpot is not part of my vision for a happy , healthy childhood			0
outfits like that not only suggest a style of dress that is inappropriate but also emphasize the notion of dressing to titillate men , rather than dressing in clothes that make you feel good about yourself			2
" what can a parent do this @entity5 to protect kids from growing up too fast ? emphasize your child 's imagination			1
@entity141 's daughter is going to be a baseball slugger -- no skirts please			0
how do you slide into home plate safely in a skirt ? ( even though @entity248 had to do it in " @entity250			0
" ) @entity220 's daughter is going as a goth girl -- all black clothes and makeup			0
other ideas : " girls can dress up as dragons , monsters , spies , secret agents , mummies , queens , and even @entity261 and the @entity262 , " @entity108 said			2
" they can be captain hook , @entity264 , the @entity265 and cowgirls , as well as lion tamers , scary clowns , astronauts , firefighters , sea captains , rock stars and @entity274 racers			0
" think comfort and safety			1
if your daughter will be running from one house to the next , make sure she wears shoes she can run in and warm clothing that protects her from the cold			2
if she 's bundled up , she 's not likely to be wearing that little black dress			0
my neighborhood listserv is filled with parent requests for costumes in specific sizes to borrow , rent or buy			2
i know someone is going to enjoy my daughter 's infant ladybug costume this year			2
i received it a couple of years ago from another parent who had bought it first			0
there 's also inspiration at your local thrift store , where i got part of my daughter 's costume cheap			0
try some last - minute ideas from websites such as @entity305 .			0

some @entity5 costumes marketed to young girls are too *provocative* , author says
think comfort and safety when helping your child pick out a costume
if you are *uncomfortable* with the available choices , you can always make a costume
