-- it could be a sign , a vague one			0
a @entity3 rover has found the building blocks of life on @entity6			1
they might be the product of past or present life on the @entity6 -- or they might not be			2
either way , the samples of organic matter in the atmosphere and in rock show that @entity6 may at least have once had conditions favorable to hosting life , @entity3 said in a statement			1
they also show that the planet is still chemically active			0
the @entity2 's tapping into organics in rock is the first find ever of life 's building blocks on @entity6 ' surface			1
gas blast the rover has run into pockets of gas on @entity6 : methane , often used to fire up gas stoves back on @entity30			1
organic matter is made up of carbon bonded with other elements , often hydrogen and oxygen			1
living things are made up of it , but life is not necessary for it to exist			0
methane is the smallest organic compound , consisting of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms			2
on our planet , methane is a fossil fuel , but it can also rise out of rotting sewage or fly through the air in flatulence			0
in other words , it usually comes from something living , or something that was once alive			0
no life found that could be the case on @entity6 , too , @entity3 said in a statement this week			1
but the space agency carefully points out that methane can also come from inanimate sources as well			0
" there are many possible sources , biological or non-biological , such as interaction of water and rock , " said @entity61 , a scientist on the curiosity team			2
at this point , @entity3 does n't know if microbes are behind the gas or just minerals			2
researchers used @entity2 's instruments a dozen times to get a breath of methane , and four of those times , it peaked at a level 10 times higher than usual			0
they believe it may have been puffed up from the ground like little burps			0
organic rock @entity2 also found organic matter while drilling into stone			1
" this first confirmation of organic carbon in a rock on @entity6 holds much promise , " said scientist @entity87 , who works on the rover team			1
these building blocks of life could have formed on @entity6 , or meteorites could have brought them there			2
scientists are n't sure yet			0
also , they ca n't be completely sure what molecules they are , because a coincidental chemical reaction that occurs in the detection device skews some of the samples			0
so far , they 've also found no sign of microbes in the rock powder , neither present nor past			1
the history of water on @entity6 has also been a popular research topic			0
the analysis of hydrogen atoms @entity2 found in rock have led @entity3 scientists to conclude that much of @entity6 ' former oceans disappeared very early -- before the rocks were formed .			1

the curiosity rover found high levels of methane gas and other organic matter in rock
it could have been produced by microbes , but there is no *concrete* evidence of that
other chemical reactions can also produce organic compounds
but existence of organic compounds on @entity6 are sign it may have supported life before
