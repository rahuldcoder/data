-- there are two sides to almost every breakup -- the dumper and the dumpee			2
( sorry , i do n't buy those " mutual " decision splits			1
i 'm sure they happen , but they 're as rare as a fat cell on @entity12 's rear end , so they do n't count			1
) do n't haunt the person you dumped by sending them a birthday card			1
while it 's ideal when both sides exit the relationship with dignity , it 's much easier to be the @entity23 when you 're the dumper			2
after all , it was your bright idea to break up			2
you 've had time to wrap your head around it , and really , who are you kidding -- you probably have a replacement lined up already			1
so we 're going to start with you , the breaker - upper , because your list of " how not to be " is a lot shorter			2
without further adieu , you definitely should not : refuse to be the bad guy			0
every breakup has one and , as the dumper , you need to suck it up and admit you 're it			0
even if you 're not particularly evil , you 're the one who used his heart as a hankie , so do n't call him , wondering if he 's " ok			1
" not only does it not absolve you from anything ( and that 's really all you 're looking for ) , it 's presumptuous			0
and while we 're at it , do n't even think about acknowledging milestones			1
nothing says @entity51 like a store - bought greeting card from the person who ruined your life ( at least for a while )			0
there is not one action more weaselly than kicking someone to the curb one week , only to send them a " @entity63 " on @entity62 the next			1
i went out with one dude whose @entity67 page consisted solely of women he 'd wrung through his emotional wringer			0
guess who he tried to add next ? i do n't think so , buddy			1
leave them on your band / performance / whatever spam list			1
the best thing about getting dumped by a musician / actress / mime is that you never have to sit through another one of their lame performances			1
the second worst thing about these emails is that they serve as a reminder you still draw breath and are experiencing some level of success			0
but the all - time worst aspect is that you just know that the list of recipients includes the person she 's currently snogging			0
this goes up an extra notch of excruciating when the sender does n't utilize the @entity97 function			1
true , running into someone you 've emotionally eviscerated is uncomfortable , but if you happen to cross paths with your ex , be polite , be discreet , and move on quickly			1
do n't coo and hover , your exaggerated frown telegraphing their status as the booted party to any and all in the area			1
getting dumped is humiliating enough without the insincere theatrics			1
rebound with a friend or family			0
the ultimate in sketchy ex behavior would have to be dumping a dude to get to his cousin ( or brother )			0
next up is his best friend			0
if you 're going to go there , at least wait a couple days before you do so			0
@entity120 ! how many times have you finally gotten over someone , only to have them come bounding back into your life the second you meet someone new ? it 's uncanny -- and unbelievably irritating -- how often this happens			0
do n't be that person			2
to ensure you wo n't , before you have " the talk " with your no - longer - significant other , picture him making out with your best friend			2
are you a ) mildly intrigued ; b ) livid ; or c ) relieved that he found someone else because now he wo n't cry when you tell him to get lost			2
if you picked @entity135 or @entity136 , you 're good to go			0
if @entity137 was your answer , well , you 'll get what you deserve when he starts dating your hotter , younger cousin			0

after you 've dumped someone , do n't try to date his friends or relatives
take your ex off all your spam lists so you do n't haunt him
do not " @entity63 " or poke them on *social* *networking* sites
