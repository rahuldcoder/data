-- about three quarters of @entity3 public libraries currently lend out e-books , and in the past year libraries have seen a sharp growth in e-book borrowing			1
still , well over half of @entity3 library card holders do n't know whether their local public library lends e-books , according to a new @entity14 report			1
@entity14 also found that 12 % of all @entity3 age 16 and older who read e-books have borrowed an e-book from a library in the past year -- and they 're generally pretty happy with the experience			1
two thirds of them characterized their library 's selection of e-book titles as " excellent , " " very good " or " good			2
" of course , there are occasional hitches			0
some library patrons reported waiting lists for popular e-books , or that the library e-book was n't offered in a format compatible with their device			1
earlier this year , @entity14 research found that about one in five @entity3 adults have read an e-book in the past year , and that e-book users tend to read over 30 % more books per year than people who only read printed material			1
if e-books encourage people to read more , that 's good for public libraries -- which have a core mission to foster literacy and community engagement with information , culture and civic life			1
also , lending e-books allows libraries to potentially serve more patrons beyond the hours and walls of their branches			0
eventually this might lead to smaller collections of printed books on library shelves , but it also could free up space to meet growing community needs for meeting rooms and computer labs			0
money is a top concern for public libraries			2
lately most have been facing an especially severe budget crunch			0
this is motivating some libraries to making acquiring e-books a higher priority			2
according to @entity14 : " a number of librarians report that some funds for purchasing printed books have been shifted to e-book purchases			1
others ' libraries have cut back on other media purchases , such as @entity82 audiobooks , to free up funds for purchases of e-books			0
" even though libraries have options to get many e-books for free , lending out many of the most popular titles definitely costs money			0
and this recently got considerably more expensive for libraries			0
publishers have historically sold e-books to libraries ( or to distributors such as overdrive ) at prices roughly equivalent to the retail hardcover price			2
however , in march , one of the largest @entity3 publishers , @entity103 , suddenly increased its library pricing for e-books by as much as 300 %			1
this was a big blow to libraries , which consider lending current bestsellers to be a critical service			0
@entity103 is the only major publisher to make e-books of its entire catalog available to any public library for unrestricted lending			1
the other " @entity117 " publishers either refuse to allow libraries to lend out their e-books ( at least their " front list " of current bestsellers ) , or they require libraries to periodically pay to re-license e-books			0
publishers have largely resisted e-book library lending because they 're concerned it might undermine their own e-book sales			0
why would consumers buy e-books if they can get them for free at the library ? but evidence indicates that publishers may not have much to fear from library e-book lending -- just like they have n't been hurt by library lending of print editions of current bestsellers			1
@entity14 found that nearly half of all @entity3 who have read a book in the previous year purchased their most recent book			1
only one fourth borrowed their most recent book from a friend ; 14 % borrowed it from a library			0
furthermore over half of e-book users who also hold library cards told @entity14 that they prefer to buy -- not borrow -- their e-books			1
among the library patrons who are currently borrowing e-books , only one - third say they generally prefer to buy e-books ; 57 % generally prefer to borrow them			2
but , interestingly , slightly more library e-books borrowers told @entity14 that when they want to find an e-book , the first place they look is an online bookstore -- not the library			1
at least one major publisher is warming up to library e-book lending			1
last week , @entity159 announced a pilot program to allow public libraries in @entity162 and @entity163 to lend out its e-books via @entity166 's cloud drive service			1
this is notable because last november @entity159 pulled its books from @entity168			0
the community role of public libraries is evolving , and libraries are seeking ways to better meet the needs of people who are especially in need of their services			1
@entity14 found that people who live in households with an annual income of less than $ 30,000 , rural dwellers , and seniors are least likely to have a library card			2
@entity14 asked people who do n't already borrow library e-books whether they might avail themselves of library programs that would prepare them for using e-books			1
nearly half said they would be " very " or " somewhat " likely to borrow an e-reading device that came loaded with a book they wanted			0
about a third would be at least somewhat likely to take library classes on how to download e-books onto handheld devices ( including smartphones ) , or classes on how to use an e-reader or tablet computer			0
@entity14 also noted : " those most interested in these services include some groups that librarians are especially eager to reach			0
african - americans , hispanics , and those who live in lower - income households are more likely than others to say they would be interested in borrowing pre-loaded e-reading devices and take classes about how to use the devices and download books			0
" clearly , public libraries have more work to do with spreading the word that they have e-books to lend			2
it also would n't hurt if the process of borrowing a e-book were less clunky at many libraries			2
to find out whether your public library lends out e-books , check their website or ask a librarian			2
or conduct a library search on @entity226			0
you 'll need a library card , of course -- so if you do n't already have one ( more than 40 % of @entity3 do n't ) , borrowing free e-books might be a good reason to finally visit your public library and get a library card			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity234 .			0

many @entity3 do n't know whether their public library has e-books , a new @entity14 report says
those who use e-books read 30 % more books per year than those who do n't
if e-books encourage people to read more , that 's good for public libraries
however , library e-book *acquisition* has been *complicated* by higher publisher prices
