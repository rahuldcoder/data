-- as royalty from different parts of the world converged on the @entity4 to watch the monarchy change hands , some of the guests there may have been thinking ahead to the day when they get the top job back home			2
in @entity12 , most monarchs are getting old and have been on their thrones for years			1
their offspring are grown up and are now waiting in the wings to take their respective crowns			0
@entity18 's prince @entity17 was in @entity19 to watch queen @entity20 hand over to her 46 - year - old son @entity21			1
he was also in the @entity4 when @entity20 herself took the throne from her mother 33 years ago on queen @entity26 's abdication			1
@entity17 's new @entity4 counterpart is @entity28 , @entity29 , who is nine			0
was @entity17 wondering when his turn would come ? perhaps , but that of course would involve the death of his mother , queen elizabeth ii. one thing is for sure -- his 61 - year wait as heir to the throne wo n't end with the abdication of his mother			2
to the @entity18 royals , the word " abdication " brings back painful memories of the 1936 crisis when @entity47 was forced to relinquish his throne so he could marry the divorced @entity50 socialite @entity49 and relinquished his throne			1
the other long - serving @entity12 queen , @entity53 also sees it as a job for life			2
however , both @entity57 and @entity35 are handing more responsibilities to their heirs			0
one option might be for them to appoint their sons @entity62 which would mean they would be in charge of royal duties while their mothers kept the title			0
crown princes and princesses across @entity12 look ready to take on the task of modern - day monarchy with all the burdens that some believe can only be carried by younger royals			1
opinion : @entity4 monarchs teach world 's royalty in @entity82 , 75 - year - old year old @entity81 's popularity has waned			1
and that 's led to suggestions , even among monarchists , that his heir , crown prince @entity86 and his wife @entity87 take over the throne			2
in @entity90 , @entity89 is 67			1
he 's been on the throne for 40 years and has recently been scandalized in the press			0
his heir , crown princess @entity92 is married to @entity93 and has a baby daughter , princess @entity94 , as the next two generations there take shape			0
and over in @entity99 , @entity98 is in his mid- 70s with an heir who will be 40 in july			1
crown prince @entity101 is married to princess @entity102			0
the couple have had two children			0
@entity105 : happy crowds applaud new king all of these heirs also have something in common that makes them appealing to a modern , more relaxed generation			2
they have all married outside the aristocracy , making them more accessible and relevant to younger subjects			0
but while the precedent of abdication has set in the @entity4 , it has n't yet taken hold elsewhere			0
however , in an age when the pope resigns , do n't be surprised if other older royals take some sort of cue from @entity20 .			1

queen @entity20 hands over the crown to her son
older monarchs are on the thrones in @entity18 , @entity82 , @entity90 , @entity99 , @entity133 and @entity134
some *analysts* say the younger generation is best *suited* for the demands of modern monarchies
