-- the singer @entity1 once declared that " the revolution will not be televised			2
" @entity3 , the " @entity4 , " transformed @entity6 's image with a witty blog			2
it is , however , going online			2
social activism is being transformed by the @entity10			1
some of the most creative forms of protest and philanthropy are taking place online			2
activists are conducting demonstrations on @entity17 , holding virtual fundraisers and using social network sites like @entity20 to change the world -- one mouse - click at a time			1
these cyber-pioneers include a nonprofit group that uses @entity27 characters to protest the global shortage of drinking water ; a web company that allows ordinary people to create their own personalized charity ; and a goodwill blogger who reshaped the thrift store 's image so thoroughly she was invited to @entity37			1
@entity38 , co-author of " @entity39 : @entity42 and @entity10 for charities , " says the @entity10 has already become a crucial source for nonprofit fundraising			1
@entity45 donated $ 550 million online in 2001 , but that number grew to $ 10.4 billion in 2007 , he says			2
" it 's a new world for a lot of nonprofit organizations , " @entity38 says			1
" no longer is it good enough to say give us some money			2
" yet some people warn that this new world offers people an excuse to engage in " drive - by activism , " superficial forms of cyber-activism that require little commitment			1
" the internet makes it very easy for people to jump in and out of social activism , " says @entity62 , assistant professor at @entity64 's @entity63			2
" if all the activism is online , it is easier to quit than going to meetings every week			2
" real change : online or in - person ? yet the @entity10 makes it easier for a nonprofit group to reach more people than a meeting ever could , one nonprofit group says			1
@entity78 is a @entity45 - based nonprofit group that created a global campaign to create safe drinking water			1
another company may have flown a spokesperson to an impoverished village and hired a film crew to promote their campaign			2
but @entity78 says it saved money and time by putting its campaign online -- through animated , virtual characters built from actual people , says @entity90 , a company spokesperson			1
@entity92 web traffic doubled to @entity78 ' web site during the campaign and the campaign attracted support from around the globe , @entity90 says			2
" real change is most often accomplished by committed individuals working together for a cause they feel passionately about , " @entity90 says			0
" whether they work together virtually or in person is less important			0
" web - based activism not only enlarges the reach of social activists , it empowers ordinary people , its advocates say			1
in another time , a person had to find a charity to give their time and money to			1
now they can create their own charity through web sites like " @entity117			0
" @entity118 has been described as a @entity119 for do - gooders			1
the new site allows a person to do everything a charity traditionally does -- raise money and awareness and recruit support -- all from a web page designed especially for their needs			0
@entity131 , the site 's co-founder , says his site designs web pages and vets charities for people who do n't have the time or expertise to do it themselves			1
" it 's for people like the 73 - year - old woman from @entity142 who created her own page to help out with a rare genetic defect she 's suffering from , " @entity131 says			1
" there 's not a lot of 73 - year - olds on @entity119			1
how do we make it easy as possible for them , but credible ? " social network sites like @entity119 are also throwing their support behind web activists			1
@entity119 has an " impact " page that connects users with political and charitable causes			0
@entity17 recently launched a " @entity158 " channel			0
' the reaction was priceless ' one of the most audacious forms of web - based activism comes courtesy of @entity163 , also known by her blog name , the @entity166			1
when @entity6 wanted to expand its customer base , its leaders devised a campaign to reach out to a younger , hipper crowd			0
the campaign 's centerpiece was @entity3			0
in her witty blog , she dispensed fashion advice , conducted an online virtual fashion show and sold goodwill clothing on @entity178 ( she once sold an $ 11.98 suit for $ 175 on @entity178			0
) @entity3 's blog averages 1,500 readers a week and has attracted readers from at least 100 countries , says @entity184 , a @entity6 spokesman			0
@entity3 's blog became so popular she was invited in september to @entity37 , a high - octane fashion show that features the world 's most popular designers			1
@entity3 still recalls how @entity37 officials acted when she told them what clothing label -- goodwill -- she represented			0
" the reaction was priceless , " she says			0
" a look of confusion came across people 's faces as they desperately tried to figure out why @entity6 was at @entity37			0
" despite the possibilities created by the @entity10 , calling people to action still depends on people putting their bodies -- not just their mouse - clicks -- on the line , says @entity62 , the @entity64 professor			1
" all of the stuff you can do online ultimately has to show up in the real world , " @entity62 says			1
" i do n't see the internet as a substitute [ for social activism ] but as a complement to it			0
" @entity211 , author of " @entity212 , '' a book that examines the psychology of social activism , also says online activism can be powerful but limited			0
he tells a story from his book to make his point			0
he says a friend took her kids to a protest against nuclear testing in front of the @entity225 during the early 1960s			0
but she became dejected because only a few people joined her demonstration and then it rained			0
years later , the same woman attended a major march against nuclear testing			0
@entity230 , the best - selling author and pediatrician who opposed the @entity232 , was a featured speaker			1
he told marchers that he was inspired to join the march after seeing a small group of women huddled with their kids in the rain while marching in front of the @entity225 years earlier			0
" i thought that if those women were out there , " @entity230 said , " their cause must be really important			0
" " he 's seeing these ragged women in the rain and it touches his heart and he ends up getting changed by that , " @entity211 says			0
" that story could n't exist in the virtual world			2
