he spent time in prison , stole a penguin to put in his bathtub and lived in an igloo for a week			1
oh and he " died " on a football pitch			2
" it was n't like a kaleidoscope -- there was no color , it was all black and white , " @entity11 tells @entity1 , recalling the moment 12 years ago when his life flashed before his eyes , the former goalkeeper suffering an injury which led the club 's physio at @entity18 to think the @entity19 was dead			1
it 's not for nothing the title for @entity11 's book is " the unstoppable keeper			1
" even now , the memory of that day in @entity18 , @entity26 , in north @entity27 , is still vivid			2
" there were black and white diamonds and it was very quiet , " said @entity11 , whose lungs collapsed after an opposition player 's knee smashed into his chest , preventing him from breathing			1
" in the background there were figures but i could n't make out who they were			2
i did n't feel cold , i felt all warm			2
i felt i was floating and it was n't a scary feeling at all			2
" after waking up from the accident and finding himself in hospital , @entity11 screamed at the nurses , convinced he was paralyzed			1
raging at the abandonment of the game , in which his team was leading , he was back training within a week			2
looking back , he says he behaved " irresponsibly " and the incident proved a turning point in @entity11 's career , in which he played for 25 clubs across the globe over two decades			1
as a youngster , @entity11 was a highly rated player and represented @entity19 's youth team at under - 17 level			1
despite the nation 's biggest club @entity56 making him an offer , @entity11 opted to pursue his dream of playing abroad			1
so in 1993 he left @entity19 to play in @entity60 with @entity61 before eventually moving to @entity27 where he enjoyed time in the @entity62 with @entity63 and @entity64			1
in @entity66 , @entity11 became a folk hero with @entity68 in @entity69 , his fame even persuading one would be gun toting assailant to apologize for inconveniencing the @entity19 as he visited the corner shop for a bottle of water			1
but it was in @entity76 where the most traumatic episode of @entity11 's career would take place after he was accused of conspiring with bookmakers			1
at the time the @entity19 was enjoying life , modeling for @entity82 and presenting his football highlights show , but he was then found guilty of match fixing and sentenced to 101 days in prison			1
protesting his innocence , @entity11 says he was not charged for match fixing , but for a verbal corrupt agreement			1
what followed was " one of the most difficult times " of his life as he adjusted to being surrounded by murderers , drug dealers and rapists			2
" the prison had no bed , no toilet , no toilet paper , no toothbrush			1
i slept on the floor , " he said			2
" people were on death row			2
" for breakfast , they do n't say good morning , they punch you in the face			0
i had to survive in that circus			0
if it was for 101 days , it felt like 25 years			0
" jail time and his near death experience in @entity27 brought about @entity11 's damascene conversion			1
@entity113 to distance himself from what he perceived was a superficial and materialistic way of life , @entity11 came up with the idea of ' @entity118 ' -- a charity to raise awareness of climate change			1
it 's a project that has prompted @entity11 to invoke the help of several famous footballers such as @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
the charity has already run successful events in @entity66 , particularly @entity130 , tackling issues such as hiv / aids , famine and education			0
now @entity11 hopes to take his football friends , who play in games to raise money , to @entity138 and bring attention to the effects of climate change			1
he hopes to hold the match at the end of 2015 or early 2016 when the weather is slightly more convivial and use the airport on @entity146 as the venue as to ensure the local habitat is n't adversely affected			2
" i want to leave the scene as if nothing had ever happened , " says @entity11			1
" we will clear the airfield using the snowmobiles , use yellow tape for the lines and we will build the nets			0
" within 10 minutes , the nets and lines are gone and nothing will be left			0
" i do n't want to hear ' this idiot is going there ' and he destroyed the natural habitat			0
there are lots of plants growing around the area and it 's very important			0
" we will have scientists advising us and if they say we can play elsewhere , fair enough but at the moment , the airfield is the most convenient			2
" having grown up in the @entity172 forests of @entity19 , @entity11 has always been passionate about the environment			1
nature fascinates him and the tranquility and cleanliness of country life remains an integral part of his life			0
" if you stand there , you can see the real @entity138 but at the same time , when you look out , you can also see what has happened , " he says			2
" it is already getting greener and that really should n't happen			0
" playing in @entity138 makes people think you 're playing in the snow and in front of mountains and that 's how it was 50 years ago			0
" now it 's not like that			0
the highlands are still white , snowy and icy but the airfield where we will play , is green , brownish and dirty			2
" @entity11 has already helped raise awareness of the effects of the climate change by spending a week living in an igloo -- a feat which was streamed online			1
he hopes to visit the @entity201 later this year and spend time living in the treetops in a bid to bring awareness to the destruction being wrought upon the world 's rainforests			1
" i was born in a village , which is now a ski resort , but it was always beautiful and clean , " he recalled			0
" whenever i go back to visit my father , everything is so natural			0
" when i started to travel , my brain began to scan things and it would compare places like @entity216 or any big city to where i grew up			0
" if you go to @entity222 , the idea of climate change does n't even seem to register on the conscience			1
" if you go to the @entity224 , you know that they will be gone in 10 - 15 years because they 'll sink			0
" it 's a real issue which we want to tackle			0
" it 's not just the environment which @entity11 is passionate about -- he loves animals too			1
during his time in @entity76 , he owned a pet monkey which caused untold trouble in his apartment			1
in @entity236 , he had another pet , although one which nearly led to him being deported			0
@entity238 , famous for its penguins , became a place of some fascination for @entity11 , who held a long - term admiration for the animal			1
one night under the cover of darkness , he pulled on a wet suit and temporarily borrowed a penguin to take home with him			0
" i saw this penguin and i got so curious and i just adopted him as a pet , " laughs @entity11			1
" they told me i could n't do that			0
so a few days later , i went and got one out			0
" i brought him back and put him in a cold bath but he was n't happy and he really did stink of fish			0
" the president of the club came for lunch and he saw that i had the penguin			0
" he said it was dangerous and that i could have been deported for having the penguin in the bathtub			0
" when not kidnapping penguins or looking to save the world , @entity11 spends his time working for @entity19 football @entity270 club 1899 @entity272			1
as head of scouting and international relations , he scours the planet looking for talented players which he can bring to the @entity270 club			0
he is a football analyst on @entity19 television while he has also become more of a feature on the television screens in the @entity283			0
he also works with world governing body @entity284 and for the @entity288 as a coaching instructor focusing on educating coaches all over the world			0
" i 've had to fight for everything since leaving prison , " he said			2
" when i came back it cost me a fortune			0
i did n't have that much money -- all i had was a pair of flip flops , a pair of shorts , a t - shirt and a bag full of debts			0
" but i ca n't complain -- at least i 'm not dead			2
