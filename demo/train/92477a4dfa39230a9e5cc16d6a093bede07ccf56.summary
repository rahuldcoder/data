-- like every political animal , i will be paying close attention to @entity5 elections this tuesday because they will tell us a lot about the next two years			1
but i will also have a special eye on a few particular races that may tell us more about our long - term future			2
whether we can lift our national politics out of the ditch increasingly depends on whether we can transform our political culture , electing more candidates who want to restore old - fashioned standards of civility , bipartisan respect and putting country first			1
sadly , the generation of politicians now in power -- baby boomers for the most part -- are so divided by ideology and a poisonous partisanship that they have lost their way			1
and the vast majority of @entity31 are turned off			1
a @entity0 poll this past week found that over 60 % of @entity31 are now angry about politics ; other surveys show that 9 out of 10 @entity31 think we have a crisis in leadership			1
a @entity39 survey out this week finds that young people -- once the optimists in a pessimistic country -- are now as distrustful of our national leadership as everyone else			1
perhaps in elections this year and in 2016 , leaders will emerge from the baby boom generation who can get us back on track			1
but given the track record so far , we also have to start looking and nurturing a new wave of leaders who will bring fresh perspectives and fresh idealism to politics			1
that 's why i will be watching two races in @entity60 and @entity61 so closely tuesday night			2
in each , there are candidates who could be on the cutting edge of a new politics			1
in both cases , they come out of the national service movement -- rising leaders who are promoting an ethic of voluntary service by every young person			1
one candidate comes out of military service , the other out of civic service here at home			2
in both we see qualities sorely missing in our national debates -- humility and a deep sense of nonpartisan duty			2
full disclosure : i have known and been a mentor to one of them , @entity88 , for nearly 15 years ; i am actively supporting him now			2
for @entity88 , the call to service came from the @entity91 , where he signed up as an infantry officer -- " it 's a good way to give back , " he told me , " and very good leadership training			1
" as @entity31 went to war in the @entity95 , off he went with his troops on the first wave into @entity98 ( an invasion he disagreed with )			1
then a second and third tours , all in danger zones			2
thankfully , he came home safely and was preparing to pursue concurrent degrees at the @entity104 and @entity105			2
his days in uniform seemed over			2
but gen. @entity107 was then named commander of all forces in @entity98 and appealed to him to put his uniform back on : he wanted @entity88 for the surge			2
off he went to a fourth tour -- not in the safety of the @entity114 but south of @entity115 amid more danger			2
@entity117 did eventually come home and earned those two additional @entity39 degrees			0
investment banks tried to recruit him after business school ; he went instead to a start - up in @entity123 trying to build high - speed rail between @entity125 and @entity126			0
then calls started up from @entity128 , asking him to run for @entity130 back home on the @entity132 of @entity60 against an incumbent @entity133 dogged by controversies			0
he took up the challenge and against all odds -- he started with virtually no name recognition and no money -- he won a huge upset victory this september			0
no one had unseated a @entity128 incumbent in @entity60 for more than 20 years			0
he is now locked in what may be a very close race this tuesday -- @entity144 have poured in buckets full of money in closing days			0
but out of the blue , the @entity147 broke a story that has everyone buzzing : the @entity147 had repeatedly demanded copies of his military record from his campaign to see if he had been lying about his service , as so many other candidates have			1
finally , the paper forced the campaign to fork over the records : lo and behold it turned out @entity117 had downplayed his record , never telling voters he had won two military medals for heroism			0
he had n't even told his parents ! @entity91 do n't like to brag , he said			0
is that the hint of a new chapter opening in @entity31 politics ? one can only wish			1
meanwhile , another worthy candidate from the national service movement has come from behind and is now in a thriller in @entity61 , facing a strong @entity144 in a red state			0
@entity176 is widely known in @entity61 as the daughter of the venerable former senator , @entity178			0
that has certainly helped her			0
but to those who have worked in the trenches trying to extend a helping hand to the millions who need it , @entity176 has earned a reputation as one of the best non-profit leaders in the country			1
she started a community volunteerism organization called hands on @entity191 , grew it until it became the national @entity193 and then merged with an organization created by president @entity195 , becoming ceo of the new @entity197			0
for those in the national service movement , @entity176 's election would be a huge breakthrough : social entrepreneurs -- so crucial to bringing energy and innovation to solve pressing social issues -- would finally have a champion from within their ranks in the halls of national power			1
in these two cases , the candidates who represent a new wave of leaders happen to be @entity128			1
fortunately , there are also stirrings among very promising @entity144 as well			0
keep your eye out for @entity218 , for example : he is the rising star who studied philosophy in college , became an amateur boxer , won a @entity224 scholarship , worked with war refugees in @entity226 and @entity227 , served tours overseas as a @entity229 and built a deeply impactful organization for wounded veterans , @entity232 ( disclosure : i am on his board )			0
@entity144 are urging him to run for statewide office in his native @entity237 -- and i hope he does			0
to their credit , there are some individuals and political organizations stepping up to identify and support other candidates who promise to bring a new , more bipartisan spirit to politics			1
former @entity246 mayor @entity245 has selected a formidable list of moderates he is supporting in this cycle through large tv ad buys totaling tens of millions of dollars			0
@entity252 professor @entity251 and @entity144 strategist @entity253 have crowd - raised over $ 10 million to support candidates open to reforming campaign finance laws			1
and several smaller organizations are helping to encourage civilian and military service alumni to run for office			0
so far , of course , the number of new generation candidates elected to office remains small			1
yet , we can already see their good works in a couple of states : @entity268 and @entity269			0
in both , alumni of @entity271 -- @entity272 and @entity273 , respectively -- ran as education reformers within the states and have delivered impressive results			0
the takeaway is this : our politics are broken and they have been for years			2
no matter which party wins the @entity5 this tuesday , the next few years could be as stagnant as the last			0
even as we put pressure on @entity282 to change -- and change soon -- wisdom says we must also persuade and inspire a new generation of servant leaders to step forward			1
fortunately , they are out there in growing numbers among social entrepreneurs , veterans and others , eager to change the country			0
this coming tuesday voters can sign up two of the best for national duty .			0

@entity298 : @entity31 politics needs new perspectives and a new generation of leaders
two candidates *epitomize* the new style of leadership aiming to solve *problems* , he says
@entity298 : can we transform our political culture and lift @entity31 out of the ditch ?
