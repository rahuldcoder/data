@entity0 , @entity1 -- it is a device that three quarters of the world 's inhabitants have access to , according to the @entity8 , but the words to describe it and etiquette of how to use it differ starkly across cultures			1
in the @entity14 , it is called a mobile , in the @entity17 cell phone , in @entity18 , in @entity20 keitai ( portable ) , in @entity22 shou - ji ( hand machine ) , in @entity24 muthophone ( phone in the palm of your hand ) , in @entity29 nalle ( teddy bear ) , in @entity31 ( wonder phone ) and in @entity33 a handy			1
in @entity20 , train commuters receive a barrage of recorded announcements telling them to switch their mobiles to silent or vibrate , referred to as " manner mode "			1
using a mobile in public is frowned upon in a land where collective needs are put above the individual 's			1
" @entity20 culture highly values social harmony and social disturbance is heavily sanctioned , " explains @entity44 , associate professor at @entity45			1
if someone tries to board a bus while taking a call , the driver will not let them on , adds cultural anthropologist @entity54			2
" in @entity20 your phone should n't be a nuisance to others , " she says			1
" this means generally keeping it on manner mode when out of the house , and not taking calls in cafes and restaurants			1
if somebody 's phone rings , they will be flustered and silence it or take a very quick call , " @entity66 explains			2
the density of urban spaces , the high use of public transportation , and the relative lack of privacy in homes contribute to ways of communicating that do n't impose on others , she explains			1
texting , mobile email , games and novels are more popular than voice calls among the @entity20			1
in @entity89 and @entity90 , in contrast , mobiles are used everywhere and people discuss are not averse to discussing their personal lives in public			1
@entity94 , the state - owned train operating company in @entity89 , once promoted its journeys on a poster depicting conversations people can have with their partners on cell phones from the train			1
smartphones are the new wingman the @entity89 , like the @entity90 , happily answer calls in restaurants , during business meetings , conferences and even sometimes during concerts			1
discreetly texting or instant messaging under the table during meetings is also commonplace , @entity110 , professor of sociology at the @entity112 , says			2
@entity89 people have always discussed their private lives in the streets , so doing so on mobile is just an evolution of that			1
" sometimes @entity89 people leave movie theaters just to check what is happening on their phone , " @entity110 says			1
" you have an obligation to be available to close friends , colleagues and customers			0
there is an obligation of accountability , " she adds			0
however , it is not the @entity89 but the @entity135 who are the chattiest on their mobiles in @entity137 , clocking up an average of 257 minutes a month , according to @entity140 's @entity139			1
then again , it is the homeland of @entity142			0
@entity143 follow closely behind the @entity135 at 240 minutes of use , while the @entity145 spend the least time talking -- an average of 46 minutes per month			0
in parts of @entity149 and @entity150 , there is also a culture of split - second calls known as " flashing " or " beeping			2
" @entity155 , a researcher at @entity156 who published a paper on " the rules of @entity159 , " said : " beeping is simple : a person calls a mobile telephone number and then hangs up before the mobile 's owner can pick up the call			1
" the mobile owner can then phone them back , thus picking up the tab for the call			1
@entity155 first came across " beeping " in @entity170 and tracked it 's use across @entity150			0
he said the practice has many different meanings from " come and pick me up " , to " hi " , to " i 'm thinking of you " to " call me back			0
" read related : seven ways mobile phones have changed @entity150 as blogger @entity181 writes : " there are unwritten but deeply observed rules for flashing			1
when your mechanic wants to tell you your car is ready , for example , he can flash you -- it 's your car , after all , and if you want it back , you 'd better call him			0
" it 's also hierarchical : an employee calling a superior , who makes more money , is justified in flashing -- unless he really needs a favor			0
" he sounds a note of warning though : " if you 're trying to woo a lady , do n't flash her			0
" read more from our @entity195 in @entity149 it is common for people to take calls inside a movie theater			2
people do n't know if the call is important so they pick up , @entity203 , of @entity204 , a telecom audit and consulting firm in @entity149 , says			0
like in @entity89 , few @entity149 have or use voicemail , he added			1
another quirk about @entity149 is that the caller may get to hear a @entity212 song , chosen by the subscriber instead of a ringing tone			0
known as caller tunes , the subscriber is charged for this monthly and according to @entity203 , they are a big money - spinner			0
this is also common in parts of @entity150 where a caller might hear a quote from the @entity223			0
in both continents , it is also common for people to take calls inside a movie theater			2
" even at highly official functions , during speeches and so on people in @entity149 take the call , " @entity228 , visiting doctoral student at @entity230 , @entity231 , says			0
" @entity149 society has a long tradition of tolerance , including in terms of allowing others to infringe on what those in the @entity243 would consider one 's personal space , " he says			0
this is why phone use in cinemas and crowded trains , is tolerated , he adds			2
" @entity149 society is also more communal than the @entity243 which , in part , leads to an increased importance of constantly staying in touch , " he adds			0
" people pick up their phones everywhere in @entity150			2
the only places they do n't are the mosque or the church , " @entity256 , @entity257 research fellow at the @entity258 , explains			2
" part of it is showing off that they have the device and if the call is from far away they like to show it 's an international call			0
" in @entity20 movie halls , on the contrary , 45 - year - old @entity271 housewife @entity270 says " we are not allowed to even put phones into silent mode because the light of the screen might make other people annoyed			1
" mobile manufacturers have also created double sim card handsets for the emerging markets so they can simultaneously benefit from the best data and voice deals			2
in general , @entity149 chat for an average of 346 minutes a month , benefiting from extremely low rates of 0.5 rupee ( less than half a cent ) a minute			0
multiple sim ownership is common across @entity289 , @entity150 and @entity18			0
in @entity150 , it is because most of the service providers are unreliable and they ca n't get a signal , @entity256 says			0
in the @entity17 , a @entity295 market research poll found that 72 per cent of @entity17 considered loud conversations in public places to be the worst habits of cell phone users			1
now the new gripe appears to be @entity302 users repeating simple questions to @entity305 's @entity304 , a robotic assistant			0
" people seem to be accepting of phone calls but not of people talking to a disembodied voice on their phone , " says @entity306 , visiting fellow at the @entity308 , @entity309			1
@entity315 was initially slow to take off in @entity18 , because " differing networks did not work well together in the early days of mobile communication causing dysfunctional text messaging across networks , " says @entity320 , professor of telecommunications at the @entity322			2
" texting is now as big in @entity18 as everywhere , " he says			0
@entity320 also said mobile internet has been slow on the uptake there as digital media tablets are becoming popular ways of going online			1
" they have a larger screen and better interface than mobile			2
