-- @entity1 and @entity2 said they enrolled at two of the nation 's most prestigious military academies to serve their country and become military officers			1
instead , they claim , they were raped -- and their military careers are now over			0
in a lawsuit filed in @entity15 on friday , the women claim the @entity16 in @entity16 , @entity17 , and the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , ignored " rampant sexual harassment			1
" the suit claims former secretary of defense @entity23 , the former superintendents of the two academies and the current secretaries of the @entity27 and @entity18 are " personally responsible " for failing to " prevent rapes and sexual assaults at the @entity18 and @entity16			1
" @entity1 was a high school honor student , championship swimmer and all - star rugby player			1
she could have gone to college anywhere with her credentials , but @entity1 chose @entity16			1
" when i was accepted , it was kind of overwhelming , " she says			0
" you ca n't imagine having that structure and discipline but at the same time having people look at you like , ' wow , you 're doing something great for our country			0
' " but @entity1 said her dream of becoming an officer was shattered in january 2011 , her second semester at @entity16			1
@entity1 said she got sick over a holiday weekend and stayed behind on campus			1
her roommate was out of town and she was alone in her room			0
it was then , @entity1 , said , that an upperclassman she knew showed up at her door late one night to talk " girl troubles			1
" " i kind of felt cool that an upperclassman wanted to be friends with me and was seeking my advice , " @entity1 recalls			1
after a drink , @entity1 said , he persuaded her to go to his room			1
" i just remember getting more and more intoxicated and my judgment really started to become impaired			0
... i remember him turning off the lights and me asking , ' what are you doing ? ' and then he proceeded to rape me			0
" @entity1 said she woke up disoriented , in physical pain , afraid to come forward			1
" i was scared it was going to ruin my career , " she said , " i was scared if i said anything , there would constantly be a target on my back			0
" according to the lawsuit , @entity1 became depressed and suicidal " as a result of the rape and hostile environment " at @entity16			1
she filed a report and requested an investigation			0
" the reason i ended up telling someone is because i did n't want that to happen to anyone else , " @entity1 said tearfully			1
@entity2 described herself as a " girly - girl " who never imagined she would end up in the military			1
@entity2 was also an all - star student and one of the best high school soccer players in the country			1
she was recruited by @entity88 schools to play soccer , but she said the @entity18 was more convincing			1
" all of their graduates from the soccer team went on and became pilots and @entity95 officers , " @entity2 said			1
" it just sounds like those women are so powerful and so well - respected , and i wanted to be that woman			0
" so in the fall of 2008 , @entity2 headed off to @entity19			1
she said her goal was to fly f - 18s but it was n't long after arriving at the academy she realized that was n't going to happen			0
" i could tell that there was a bias towards women , " @entity2 recalled			2
" you 're a female entering into a fraternity			0
" during one of he first weekends at the academy , @entity2 was invited to a party off campus			2
" i was like , ' ok , cool ! college , finally ! i can live the college life for one night			0
" but @entity2 said she had way too much to drink , so when a fellow midshipman offered her a place to crash , she accepted			2
" i was like , ' ok , you know , it will be fine			0
you 're an upperclass , " @entity2 remembers , " because that 's what they teach you , to trust your upperclass			2
" but @entity2 says that did n't happen			1
" at one point in the middle of the night , i did come to and he was on top of me , " @entity2 said			2
" and i remember saying ' no , ' but i just passed out again			0
@entity2 said , she too , was afraid to come forward			2
" i did n't want to be the girl that got the athlete kicked out , we had been told stories about how that happened in the past and i did n't want to be that next story			0
" for the next two years @entity2 said she battled depression and thoughts of suicide			2
it was a secret she could n't keep anymore			0
when she told her father what happened , he encouraged her to file a report and request an investigation			0
@entity1 and @entity2 said they believed their cases were being investigated			1
@entity1 remembered investigators meeting with her parents about her case			2
" they promised my parents that if he was n't going to jail , they could at least get him kicked out of @entity16 with the evidence they had , " she said			0
but both women said their alleged perpetrators were never punished and are still in the military			0
@entity1 and @entity2 are not alone			1
reports of sexual assault at @entity16 , the @entity18 and the @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 , are up nearly 60 percent , and according to the @entity169 , of the 65 reports investigated , only one resulted in a court - martial			1
and it 's that rise in reports of sexual assault that has the top man at the @entity169 , secretary of defense @entity175 , changing the rules			1
" we 've got to train commanders to understand that when these complaints are brought , they 've got to do their damnedest to see that these people are brought to justice , " @entity175 told @entity0 's @entity177 in an exclusive interview			0
@entity175 could not comment on @entity1 's and @entity2 's cases specifically because of privacy issues , but he made clear that blaming of the victim needs to stop			1
" i think that 's part of the syndrome that we 're dealing with , which is that once a decision is made that somehow this prosecution is not going to move forward then you basically turn on the victim who brought that complaint , " @entity175 said			0
" that syndrome is what we have to break out of			0
" just last week , after the @entity0 interview , @entity175 announced he has created a @entity199 to investigate sexual assault allegations , and that sexual assault allegations will be dealt with at the level of colonel instead of slowly making their way up through the chain of command			1
but the changes in policy have come too late for @entity1 and @entity2			1
their military careers are over			0
according to the lawsuit , " as a result of the rape , " @entity1 became " depressed and suicidal			2
" she said she was unable to handle the stress of seeing the alleged perpetrator every day , so she resigned from @entity16			0
@entity2 said she also became suicidal			2
she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and according to her lawsuit , was then " forced to leave the academy			0
" the two women said they are telling their stories so that others at the academies will feel comfortable coming forward			0
" i know that with at least one person coming forward there will be others who want to come forward and say something , " @entity1 said			2
similarly , @entity2 said , " i want to encourage other women to report as soon as possible because then they might get their perpetrators put behind bars , which is where they should be , which is where they deserve to be			2
" @entity16 and the @entity18 told @entity0 they were unable to comment on the allegations due to privacy issues			2
both women have requested copies of their case files to learn more about why their alleged perpetrators are still in the military .			0
