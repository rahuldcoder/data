a man who owns an @entity2 food store funded @entity3 , tried to send jihadists to @entity5 to fight with the terrorist group and plotted to do some killing himself -- by gunning down @entity8 troops who had served in @entity9 -- federal authorities alleged tuesday			1
@entity11 , 30 , was arrested on may 31 , though federal officials did n't outline the case against him until tuesday			2
according to an indictment , he faces three counts of trying " to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization " ( namely , @entity3 ) , one count of attempting to kill officers and employees of the @entity8 , two counts of having an unregistered firearm silencer and one for possessing guns or silencers " in furtherance of a crime of violence			1
" the public defender representing @entity11 , @entity29 , said tuesday that he had seen the indictment and will enter a plea of not guilty when his client appears in court on thursday morning			2
the federal investigation into @entity11 began in early 2013 and a world away from the @entity36 , where @entity3 ( also known as @entity3 and the @entity37 ) has waged a brutal campaign in recent years			1
citing the terror group 's threat to the region and gruesome tactics -- such as the recent beheadings of two @entity8 journalists -- the @entity8 government has struck @entity3 targets from the air in @entity9 and threatened to go after it in @entity5 as well			1
a look at @entity50 suggests that @entity11 did n't stand with his adopted country in this fight , according to an affidavit in support of a search warrant in his case			0
he allegedly wrote in one tweet : " @entity59 said it loud and clear : we are fighting the @entity8 invasion and their hegemony over the earth and the people			0
" in another message , @entity11 purportedly stated @entity3 " will one day rule the world with the will of @entity69			1
" the affidavit alleges that he urged people to donate a third of their salary or , at least , " @entity76 " ( as stated in one tweet ) -- stressing the importance of supporting groups like @entity3 financially			0
but the @entity78 - born owner and operator of @entity80 and @entity81 , dubbed @entity82 's by some , in @entity84 may have wanted to be more than just a financial supporter			2
court documents state that -- if he could n't sell his store -- @entity11 wanted to export " those who are fed up ( and want ) to go to war and be jihadists			2
" the @entity93 informants were among those @entity11 actively recruited to join @entity3 as jihadists , the affidavit states			1
he helped them by doing things like paying one of their passport costs , coordinating travel arrangements and setting them up with contacts in the terror group under the guise of going " to the university , " which was code for joining @entity3			1
court documents , citing @entity106 records , allege that @entity11 also sent $ 600 to a @entity78 man that he believed wanted to join the terrorist group			0
he may have had plans of his own in the @entity8			0
the affidavit points to conversations with the two @entity93 informants in which @entity11 talked about getting his hands on guns and ammunition to inflict violence stateside			1
according to the affidavit , @entity11 once said he might kill " five or ten already , 15 , something like that ... then we " will post video or another message online to explain why he did it " we want ... to start shooting those who were in the @entity128 who went to @entity9 , " he said in april , according to the document			1
authorities say they arrested @entity11 after he paid for and received two handguns , silencers and ammunition from one of the informants			2
@entity11 is now in federal custody			0
if convicted , he could be there for far longer : the firearms possession charges alone have maximum 30 year sentences , the attempted murder charge maximum sentence is 20 years , and a count for providing material support to a terrorist group is up to 15 years			0
attorney general @entity145 said the case shows federal authorities use of " all the investigative tools at our disposal " -- from searches of social media platforms to @entity93 informants -- " to break up these plots before individuals can put their plans into action			0
" " we will remain aggressive in identifying and disrupting those who seek to provide support to @entity3 and other terrorist groups that are bent on inflicting harm upon @entity8 , " @entity145 said			1
" ... we are focused on breaking up these activities on the front end , before supporters of @entity3 can make good on plans to travel to the region or recruit sympathizers to this cause			0
" fixer recounts how @entity3 abducted him and @entity171 @entity3 turns to glossy magazine for propaganda			0
