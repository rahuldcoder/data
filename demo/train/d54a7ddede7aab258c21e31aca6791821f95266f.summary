-- its art collection is the envy of galleries the world over , but until now the @entity6 has been better known for @entity8 masterpieces rather than hip modernist artworks			1
that may be about to change : the home of the @entity12 has announced it will exhibit at the ultra-fashionable @entity13 for the first time later this year			1
in a bold move away from the works of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 for which it is renowned , the @entity6 picked @entity21 new media art collective @entity22 , @entity25 - @entity24 photographer @entity23 , and @entity28 - born @entity27 painter @entity26 to interpret its chosen theme			1

" cardinal @entity38 , president of the @entity39 , said the stories of @entity34 were " fundamental for culture and for @entity12 tradition , " and had inspired some of the greatest works in the history of art. @entity38 said the book -- and the artists ' works it had given rise to -- examined " the mystery of man 's origins , the introduction of evil into history , and our hope and future projects after the devastation symbolically represented by the @entity61			2
" @entity62 , director of the @entity63 , said @entity22 's installation explored the theme of " creation " using " the immaterial image , light , sound , and sensory stimuli			2
" @entity62 said @entity23 had selected a " specific and extremely evocative sequence " of his photographs to examine the idea of destruction , or " @entity75 , " " [ exposing ] an abandoned , wounded world			0
" he said @entity26 had used salvaged materials to form a meditation on " re-creation " and the " continuous and cyclical action of recovery and erosion ... forcing fragility and monumentality to coexist			0
" @entity38 said the result was " a vital , rich and elaborate dialogue , " which he hailed as a sign of the @entity6 's " renewed , modern patronage " of the arts			2
@entity90 , president of the @entity13 , welcomed the @entity6 's debut at the show , hailing it as " an event of great importance			1
" the @entity13 is one of the world 's best - known contemporary art exhibitions ; founded in 1895 , it is held every two years			1
the work of leading artists is showcased in national " pavilions " across the city 's @entity102 district			1
the 55th @entity104 will take place from june 1 to november 24 , 2013 , and will feature works by @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
