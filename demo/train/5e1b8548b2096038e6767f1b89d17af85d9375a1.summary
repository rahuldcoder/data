-- @entity1 works with a limited arsenal of tools : a surgical scalpel , some cardboard , every so often a circular cutter and lots of glue			1
but from that humble toolkit , he makes sculptures that are mind - bendingly complex			1
for the past 10 years , the @entity15 , @entity14 artist has been building intricate cardboard sculptures in the form of whimsical flying machines and rickety roller coasters			1
they look like pencil sketches brought to life , and with good reason			2
long before @entity1 began crafting his cardboard pieces , he was drawing them in his notebook			1
he 'd sketch crazy roller coasters and off - beat architectural structures			2
one day he visited his neighbor ( an architect ) , who showed him models made from boxboard			2
" i said , ' can i have some of that cardboard , ' and from there i started creating my roller coasters , " he recalls			1
" all of a sudden what was on the page became this really elaborate @entity39 sculpture			0
" it was n't all of a sudden , of course			0
constructing the piecesis a painstaking process that typically takes one to three months			1
nowadays , @entity1 has enough experience to forego the sketching process and build as he goes			1
he 'll think up some strange contraption and simply begin cutting pieces of cardboard and piecing them together with @entity50 glue			1
he prefers working with the scalpel ( " i go through four or five a day , " he says ) and uses only three gauges of board : 1mm , .8 mm and .2 mm. many of @entity1 's pieces are marvel of balance			1
in one , a crepe - like balloons balances on top of fragile unicycle			0
in another a house sits high on a system of thin - as - toothpick scaffolding			0
each of these pieces has glue , yes , but they also have built - in structural integrity , much in the way an architect uses hidden elements to build a robust building			0
this requires a huge amount of trial and error			0
" i have to make it and tear it apart and then throw it away and start again , " he says			0
" it 's very much like drawing and rubbing out [ erasing ]			0
so even though they 're technically sculptural , i feel like they 're drawings in cardboard			2
" for now , the sculptures are moderately sizedâ € ” they range from around 20 to 30 inches tall			2
but @entity1 has plans to make them even bigger			1
he has an idea to make a @entity87 plane with a @entity88 — 10 meter wingspan			0
" i want to make all the ribs , all the componentry , the skeletal structure all the way through , " he says			0
" it 's going to take a lot of cardboard			2
