-- @entity1 began the defense of their @entity5 crown with an emphatic 3 - 1 victory against title rivals @entity8 in @entity9 on tuesday			1
the @entity10 , who have won the tournament a record six times , had to come from behind after conceding a 12th - minute goal in the @entity15 opener in @entity16			1
@entity8 , seeking a third title , took the lead when striker @entity19 , who plays for @entity22 club @entity20 , cut in from the right and lashed in a fierce left - foot effort that goalkeeper @entity25 could only tip into the net			2
@entity19 's strike partner @entity27 thought he had earned a penalty when his cross hit the arm of @entity1 defender @entity31 , but referee @entity32 ruled it was not intentional			2
@entity1 leveled in the 34th minute when @entity34 ran onto @entity36 's throughball , rounded @entity37 as the goalkeeper rushed out of his area , and slotted the ball into the empty net			1
captain @entity36 put his side ahead nine minutes after halftime , with his shot wrong - footing @entity37 after taking a massive deflection off the backside of @entity47 following a layoff from @entity49			0
@entity8 coach @entity50 surprisingly took off @entity52 midfielder @entity51 with 10 minutes to play and replaced him with veteran @entity54 striker @entity53			0
but the move backfired as @entity1 substitute @entity57 drove in a low right - foot shot on 88 to seal his side 's first victory over the @entity8 in 23 years			1
in tuesday 's other @entity15 match , @entity61 came from two goals down to deny @entity64 a historic first victory at the tournament			1
the @entity67 did earn their first point , but were expecting much more after scoring twice before halfway through the opening period			0
striker @entity70 , who plays for @entity72 club @entity71 , netted the opener from the penalty spot in the 14th minute after being brought down by @entity61 goalkeeper @entity75			2
@entity76 then put through his own net seven minutes later as he stabbed the ball past @entity75 while trying to clear a loose ball , but @entity79 pulled a goal back after half an hour when he headed home as @entity64 defended woefully at a corner			0
substitute @entity83 leveled the score 10 minutes after halftime as goalkeeper @entity86 , who had flapped ineffectually to allow @entity79 to score , was caught out after coming out of his area to clear the ball			0
with the multi-ball system in operation , @entity61 took a quick throw - in and @entity91 set up @entity83 with @entity86 scrambling in vain back to his goal .			0
