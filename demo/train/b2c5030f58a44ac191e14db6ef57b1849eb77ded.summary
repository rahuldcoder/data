it 's a love song to a creepy , scale - covered mammal that kind of looks like the cross between a dinosaur and a pine cone			1
and i kinda - sorta love it			1
it 's " my pangolin friend [ official music video ] , " uploaded to @entity9 by @entity11 songwriter and actor @entity10			1
@entity10 , a 30 - year - old waiter and self - described " starving artist , " made the video in response to my @entity17 story on pangolin trafficking in @entity19			1
the pangolin is thought to be the most trafficked mammal , by numbers , in the world			1
this unknown underdog is sold illegally and by the ton for its scales , which are used in bogus medicine , and for its meat , which is a super-high - end delicacy in @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity10 read the story and , he told me in an e-mail , decided to write a semi-vulgar love song to this strange animal , which he 'd never heard of before			1
" there are a ton of animals out there in dire need of help " he told me , " but a lot of them have entire armies of activists fighting on their behalf			2
i loved the idea that i could have a small part ( in ) drawing some more attention to an animal that has n't gotten enough of it			0
" @entity52 doc : inside the pangolin trade the result is charming and weird and offensive and awesome			2
the chorus -- which croons , " please do n't eat myyyyy ... pang - o - lin friend " -- is seriously catchy			2
then @entity10 writes about how the pangolin secretes gross - smelling stuff out of its anal glands -- which is true , sometimes -- and also about how people eat its fetuses to supposedly boost sex drive			1
it gets a little weird , but it 's for a good cause			2
in @entity29 and @entity67 , where i went to report the story that inspired this song , the pangolin is both mysterious and valuable			1
its scales , which are made of fingernail - type material , are supposed to help women lactate			1
a group meal of pangolin at a restaurant in @entity79 could run $ 2,000 -- partly because the meat is a status symbol			1

i also am still just thrilled that so many of you donated a total of $ 17,000 to @entity92 , which is going to make a pangolin - focused @entity94 to air in that country because of your generosity			1
take a look at @entity10 ' video ( as well as this one from that " honey badger " guy ) , and read this lightly edited version of our e-mail convo below			1
oh -- and please please do n't eat his pangolin friend			2
me : what do you like most about the pangolin ? @entity110 who makes pangolin music videos in his spare time : i am amazed by so many things about this animal , such as their gentle , almost friendly demeanor ( like an ugly - cute version of my cat @entity119 ) , their crazy long tongues that wreak terror on unsuspecting ant colonies , and their unbelievably versatile tails , used for things like hanging from tree branches and even walking on their hind legs			1
i 'd have to say my favorite characteristic , though , is its defense mechanism of rolling into a tight ball to ward off predators			0
while researching , i found this amazing video online of a pangolin that withstood an attack by eight lions by rolling itself up into this tight little ball			2
after something like three hours , the lions finally gave up and the pangolin just sauntered off into the woods again			2
unreal ! me : how did you get interested in pangolins ? @entity146 guy : i 've always been a lover of all things nature			1
i grew up spending summers at camp in @entity150 , camping and hiking throughout the @entity151 ; and in 2008 i thru - hiked the @entity152			2
i 'm an avid animal lover ( presently going strong on my third attempt at vegetarianism ! ) ; but i am also an actor in @entity11 , and escaping the urban lifestyle can sometimes feel impossible			0
every once in a while , however , an opportunity comes along that allows me to combine the two lifestyles			0
a few months ago , that was the case when i was hired by maxanimal.com to write a humorous song about an animal to be featured on their website			2
i had no idea what to write about , so i started reading , a lot			0
my friend @entity169 , who is featured in the video with me , and a regular host on @entity161 , sent me an email with loads of links to articles about animals , including one about a woman who keeps 200 sloths at her house , and another about giant rats			2
but i was instantly drawn to your article on @entity183 , " @entity184			1
" it felt important , and the pangolin 's struggle felt desperate			1
the deciding factor for me was the that i had never heard of the pangolin before			0
there are a ton of animals out there in dire need of help , but a lot of them have entire armies of activists fighting on their behalf			0
i loved the idea that i could have a small part ( in ) drawing some more attention to an animal that has n't gotten enough of it			0
me : tell about how you wrote the song ? dude who sings about anal glands : this song came surprisingly easy			0
as per my assignment , the song had to be humorous , which was a little intimidating at first , for two reasons : 1			0
being told to be funny sucks , and 2			0
the survival of a species is a serious subject , and i did n't want the real issue to be overshadowed by male anatomy references and poop jokes			0
the turning point was when i thought to write the song as a love letter to the pangolin			1
once i embraced that idea , i was able to balance the the dirty jokes with genuine love and concern for this animal , and the punch lines felt somehow more poignant and less offensive			0
me : what 's up with the format for the video -- where did you get the idea ? our resident pangolin enthusiast : the video was shot at a studio in @entity241			1
i went in with the song , and the amazing team at @entity161 shot the video			0
over the next couple of weeks , their editor , @entity245 , edited and sent out rough cuts , and we all weighed in on the best ways to visually entertain people while also preserving the integrity and message of the song			0
one challenging aspect was that it was nearly impossible to find high definition footage of pangolins that we could use on such a limited budget			0
me : who 's that in the video with you ? @entity110 from the video : my dear friend @entity263			0
she is a frequent host on the website , and recommended me to the team when they mentioned adding a musical aspect to the site			0
me : what 's your favorite line for the song ? indecisive songwriter : i feel like i have to give two answers to this question : 1			1
" this little girl 's got a heart of gold , and she 'll love you just as long as she 's alive			1
" this line is the song			0
" please do n't eat my pangolin friend , it 's cheaper to sit hookers on your face			1
" i love this joke because it 's true ! the amount of money people pay to kill and eat this harmless and beautiful animal is absurd ! and for what ? false promises			2
you stand as much of a chance of getting an erection by chewing on your fingernails ( as getting one from eating a pangolin , which is seen by relatively few people as an aphrodisiac			0
) me : what do you do when you 're not making semi-vulgar videos about scale - covered mammals ? possibly offended artiste : i am an actor and a musician			1
trained in musical theatre ( sic ) at the @entity309 and @entity310 in @entity11 , i live the typical starving artist 's life			0
i wait tables at @entity314 to pay the bills ; and when i 'm not serving burgers and fries , i write music , audition and hit the stage any chance i get			0
me : do you write other music ? marketing - savvy musician : @entity325 ! please check out my band , @entity327 , and our album this is @entity327 , available on @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , and all that good stuff			0
i also have more tunes coming soon to @entity9 and maxanimal.com .			0
