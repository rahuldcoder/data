@entity0 -- @entity3 's famous boy reporter certainly liked to stray from his native @entity4			1
@entity6 's official profession may be that of a reporter , but he is just as much an explorer and archaeologist , dashing around the world to chase down ancient artifacts in addition to nefarious villains and a good story			1
carrying on a venerable tradition of filmic archaeologists and adventurists such as @entity19 , the new @entity6 film by @entity21 , entitled " @entity6 : the @entity26 , " mixes the story - lines of several of @entity3 's books and follows @entity6 and friends hunting for centuries - old treasure			1
" @entity3 was always interested in exotic locations and travel around the world , " said @entity27 - based ' @entity6 ' and comic - book artist @entity29			1
" keep in mind that he comes out of the tradition of ( @entity37 author ) @entity36 , whose characters are always traveling around the world and finding lost civilizations and incredible ruins , " he continued			0
@entity29 , who is co-author of the @entity43 guide to @entity6 , spoke to @entity1 about his favorite historical escapades and archaeological " macguffins " from the classic series of comic books , beloved around the world by adults and children alike			1
' @entity51 ' published in 1934 , this is the first @entity6 adventure to have featured an archaeological premise , @entity29 says , explaining that the storyline was " clearly influenced " by the discovery of the tomb of ancient @entity57 by @entity58 in 1922			1
the plot begins with @entity6 meeting an archaeologist looking for the lost tomb of a mysterious @entity62 and is driven by the appearance of a number of cigars bearing mysterious -- seemingly ancient @entity57 -- symbols			1
moving from @entity67 to @entity68 and on to @entity69 , @entity29 says the book is " a catalog of archaeological myths and popular @entity73 © s from the late 19th and early 20th centuries			2
" ' @entity75 ' this book , published in 1937 , charts the hunt for a @entity78 that is stolen from the @entity79 in @entity80			0
" it 's kind of a fetish object , a small wooden idol with a broken ear , " said @entity29			0
" we find out that there is some kind of a precious stone hidden in the idol and everyone is fighting over it			0
" " @entity3 is using the complications of having various people try to seize the idol as a pretext for a travelogue around @entity95 , " says @entity29 , explaining that @entity3 was as interested in anthropology as he was archaeology , with @entity6 coming into contact with native @entity95 tribesmen along the journey			1
' @entity101 ' published in 1949 , " @entity101 " is a sequel to " @entity103 , " in which a group of explorers are struck down with an unexplained illness after discovering the tomb of a mummified @entity108 in @entity109 -- a storyline which echoes the supposed @entity111 that was much - discussed at the time			0
in " @entity101 , " @entity6 and friends are charged with rescuing their friend @entity114 from native tribesmen , who are angry about what they see as the desecration of their culture and are eventually revealed to be last remaining descendants of the @entity108			0
" at the end of the day , it is about the right of the @entity108 civilization to ( protect their ) culture , " said @entity29			2
" @entity3 presents the other side of the issue , which is that these civilizations deserve to be respected -- which considering the time period , is very forward - thinking			2
" in the end , @entity6 manages to secure the release of the kidnapped explorers and in exchange promises never to reveal the location of the remaining @entity108			0
' @entity26 ' and ' @entity135 ' moving from ancient civilizations to pirates and buried treasure , " @entity26 " and " @entity135 " form the basis for the script of " @entity6 : the @entity26			0
" both chart tintin and various other parties ' attempts to unearth the lost loot of 17th century pirate , @entity146			0
" half of ( @entity26 ) is actually a flash - back to the great days of the pirates , " said @entity29 , explaining that @entity6 's friend @entity147 is the ancestor of the sea captain who killed @entity149 all those years ago			1
at the end of " @entity135 , " after a voyage in a submarine resembling a shark , the treasure turns out to be hidden in @entity147 's ancestral home			0
' @entity159 ' " @entity159 is the penultimate @entity6 book and has a very strange ending , " explains @entity29			1
the book , published in 1968 , is strongly influenced by the science fiction of the time , said @entity29 , and features an incredible plot device in which the gods worshiped by the ancient peoples of a volcanic island @entity168 are revealed to have been extraterrestrials			2
" we are left with an ongoing mystery , ( presented as ) the ultimate answer to archaeology , " said @entity29 .			2
