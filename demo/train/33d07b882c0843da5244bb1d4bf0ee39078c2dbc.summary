@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 said monday it will cut the price of its main @entity6 video game console model by about 13 percent in the @entity7 , hoping to boost sales ahead of the crucial holiday season			1
@entity3 is aiming at expanding the appeal of the @entity6 to an audience outside its core fan base			1
the move reduces the price of the @entity6 model by $ 50 , to $ 350 , and follows a move last month by rival @entity18 to cut the price of its @entity21 machine by 17 percent , to $ 500			1
faced with unexpectedly strong competition from @entity25 's cheaper @entity24 console , @entity3 is aiming at expanding the appeal of the @entity6 to an audience outside its core fan base of young men			1
" as we look to the holidays we want to bring in more gamers and lower the price for those customers , " the @entity6 's group product manager , @entity30 , said in an interview			1
" we 're always trying to bring down cost of the box and ... we always try to pass on the savings to our consumers			0
we feel like this is the right time to do it			0
" the price of the @entity42 , which does not include a hard drive , will fall $ 20 to $ 280 while the @entity45 model , which features a 120 - gigabyte drive , six times the size of the @entity6 's , will fall $ 30 to $ 450			1
the cuts will take effect from august 8 , @entity3 said			2
launched in november 2005 , the @entity6 has gone 20 months without a price cut , the longest of any console in history			1
@entity18 's @entity53 held its $ 300 price for 18 months after launching in the @entity7 in 2000			2
" it surprised me a little bit because there 's not a whole lot of market pressure on them to lower the price , " said @entity55 , an analyst with market research firm @entity56			0
" is it going to make an enormous difference ? no , because when it comes to consoles , it 's not the price that sells the console , it 's the games that sells the console and from that perspective , @entity3 's in pretty good shape , " @entity55 said			1
the rising sophistication of consoles , which boast graphics performance that rivals personal computers costing several times as much , means manufacturers are more reluctant to drop prices			0
that 's particularly true for @entity3 , which has yet to turn a profit on the @entity85 business it launched in 2001 in a bid to challenge @entity18 's growing dominance in the living room			2
by the end of june , @entity3 had sold 5.6 million @entity91 in the @entity7 , compared with 2.8 million wiis and 1.4 million @entity21 -- the latter two launched a year later			0
@entity3 forecasts its entertainment and devices division , home to the @entity85 , @entity97 and @entity98 digital music player businesses , to turn profitable in its current fiscal year after two years of losses totaling more than $ 3 billion			2
the @entity102 , @entity103 - based company has forecast revenue at the division to grow by between 10 percent and 19 percent this year from sales of $ 6.08 billion in fiscal 2007			0
@entity30 said @entity3 timed the price cut to coincide with the release of @entity110 's " @entity109 " , the latest installment of the publisher 's top - selling football franchise			1
" @entity113 tends to be seasonally slow , but we definitely see a big uptick starting with ' @entity116 ' , and accelerating through the end of the year , " @entity30 said			0
@entity3 is also banking on the highly anticipated final episode of " @entity119 " , its flagship game franchise , to be a major profit driver this year			2
the game hits stores on september 25			0
