-- @entity4 was " polite and cooperative " in her first meeting with her probation officer for check fraud and fraudulent use of a personal @entity9 , a @entity1 @entity3 spokeswoman said thursday			1
@entity10 , the department 's communications director , said that @entity12 reported to a probation office wednesday at 6 p.m. for a visit that lasted a little over an hour			2
@entity12 previously had been sentenced to one year of probation , which including monthly check - in meetings plus " random contacts " in the public			2
" she told the probation officer that she intended to do well on probation , " @entity10 said of @entity12			1
" she was polite and cooperative			0
" in july , a jury acquitted @entity12 on murder charges related to the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity4 , though she was convicted on four counts for misleading law enforcement			1
the probation sentence stems from a different conviction , for which a judge sentenced her in january 2010 , on felony check fraud for stealing a checkbook from a friend and writing five checks for $ 644.25			2
@entity12 's attorneys have argued repeatedly -- and , ultimately , unsuccessfully -- that their client should not have to serve her probation in @entity1 , pointing to a court document that erroneously stated she would serve her probation while in prison awaiting the murder trial			1
as the corrections department had previously said in a statement , officials are not releasing @entity12 's address " or anything that might lead to the discovery of her location , " said @entity10			1
this move is an effort to comply with a judge 's order that @entity12 's whereabouts should remain confidential for her own safety			2
" the court made a pretty strong statement , talking about how she 's one of the most hated women in @entity64 , " @entity10 said			0
" we want to make sure that she 's treated like other offenders , in that if she violates these court orders , we will immediately notify the court			0
but we will put security measures in place			0
" those measures include not inputting @entity12 's information into a public database , as is typically the case with offenders			2
in addition , her probation officer will not be identified by name			2
under the terms of her sentence , @entity12 must meet with her probation officer no later than the fifth day of each month			1
she ca n't change her residence or employment and , as @entity10 said thursday , her probation officer would have to ok a travel permit if @entity12 wants to leave the county			1
her probation office is in @entity89 , unless she makes a request that is granted to move elsewhere in @entity1			0
none of @entity12 's attorneys was present when she met with the probation officer wednesday , the state spokeswoman said			1
in that meeting , the officer " laid out for her , in detail , the conditions " -- after which @entity12 indicated " she understood those conditions , " said @entity10			0
among other things , @entity12 's sentence requires her to pay the state of @entity1 $ 20 per month toward the cost of supervision plus a 4 % surcharge , unless the fees are waived			1
during the period covered by the sentence , she will not be allowed to drink excessively			0
she is also barred from any personal contact with the check - fraud victim for the duration of the probation period			0
@entity89 circuit judge @entity115 had earlier ordered @entity12 to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter , but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed , instructing that @entity12 would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial			2
the order was updated august 1 to add the words " upon release			0
" but @entity12 's lawyers contended that she could n't be required to serve probation , arguing that she had already served it while in custody under a signed order from @entity115			1
they also argued that serving the probation sentence now would violate constitutional protections against having to serve a sentence twice for the same offense			0
a @entity1 appeals court affirmed earlier this week that @entity12 would have to serve the one - year probation sentence			1
she can not , the court ruled , " take advantage " of an administrative error to avoid serving the sentence , which was first imposed in 2010			0
this backed up a ruling earlier this month by @entity89 chief judge @entity149 , who said @entity115 's verbal order was binding and ordered @entity12 to report for probation in @entity1 on the bad - check charge by friday			1
the attorney general 's office wrote that @entity12 " upon her release ( july 17 ) , should have reported " for probation -- something she did not do			0
in an emergency petition filed on wednesday with the same appeals court , @entity12 's defense team asked that the court overturn @entity149 's order before the required date			1
they also asked the appellate court to strip @entity149 of further jurisdiction in the case			0
@entity0 's @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
