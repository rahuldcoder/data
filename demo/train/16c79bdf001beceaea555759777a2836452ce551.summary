@entity0 is a portrait of an all - american mom of eight and grandmother of 18 who survived an extraordinary journey lasting a decade : she became addicted to prescription painkillers and then to heroin			1
you 'd never guess it			2
trim , petite , with a bob and easy smile , @entity0 had enough energy to work full - time and preside over a large family in @entity18			1
she had it all -- until it crumbled			1
her dark secret about a taboo drug is not as isolated as it seems , especially with the revelations of public figures whose early deaths involved heroin , such as actor @entity28 , who overdosed on a cocktail of legal and illegal drugs			1
prescription drug abuse is now a health epidemic in @entity33 , worse than crack in the 1980s , and @entity0 's story is one example			1
her addiction to a handful of prescription drugs , with @entity40 as first and foremost , led to heroin because it gave her the same high at a cheaper price			1
" in the beginning , it was a feel - good , " said @entity0 , 55			1
" at the end , it was black			2
" @entity0 did n't shoot heroin			1
rather , she smoked it using a straw , tinfoil and a lighter to inhale a smaller than pea - sized pinch of " black tar " heroin			1
she exhaled the smoke through a fan vent in the basement bathroom of her home , sometimes at 2 a.m. , so her children would n't smell anything			1
" there 's such a stigma about heroin , that it 's dirty and it 's iv users under the bridge and homeless people , and that is so not the case , " @entity0 said			1
" @entity70 crosses all borders , all socioeconomic groups			2
" @entity0 's addiction was far from unique			1
the path from prescription drugs to heroin is well traveled , according to dr. @entity77 , a psychiatrist at the @entity79 's @entity78			1
" that is very common			2
i have a lot of patients that ask me , ' are prescription opioid painkillers gateway drugs towards heroin ? ' " @entity77 said			1
" @entity0 's drug use , while extreme , should n't obscure one reality : " prescription drug abuse is a massive problem in the @entity33 , " @entity77 said			1
how it began for @entity0 , her addiction began -- as they all do -- innocently enough			1
she sought relief from hip pain , possibly caused by scarring from cesarean sections she had delivering several of her children			1
her then - husband recommended a physician			2
" there was no physical therapy offered , " she said of the doctor 's visit			1
" the first reaction was , let 's give you some drugs			2
" he put her on @entity40			2
by the second week , she was physically addicted			2
she was popping so much of the painkiller and other drugs such as anti-anxiety @entity110 that they equated to a dosage for three men			2
a second doctor reduced her prescription , causing @entity0 to experience withdrawal symptoms , or become " dope - sick			1
" " when you start withdrawing from opiates , it focuses in your lower back and your legs , and it is like somebody has clamped a vice on both sides of your hips and is just smashing you			2
hitting my back with a baseball bat would have been more comfortable , " @entity0 said			1
she was desperate for more oxycontin			2
" some people are not addicts and can take drugs as prescribed , " she explained			2
" but for the few people who are addicts , it 's a whole different ball game			2
" to feed her cravings , @entity0 leveraged her maternal authority : she found drug dealers who were friends of her eldest children			1
" when you have eight children , " she said , " you 're bound to know people			1
" it was so easy			2
but it was also so expensive			2
one @entity40 pill cost $ 80 on the street			2
" one @entity40 would n't last me at all , " she said			2
" i could never take just one @entity40			2
that would n't even keep the dope - sick away			0
" so she turned to heroin			1
why ? her fear of withdrawal was greater than her fear of the drug			1
living fearlessly like @entity40 , heroin was abundant on the street			1
once you bought from one dealer , several more approached you , she said			0
she bought seven balloons -- or seven grams -- of heroin for $ 100 , she said			1
that kept her high for up to three days			0
" i would do some crazy stuff to get drugs , " she said			0
" like 2 o'clock in the morning , i 'm making a run to downtown @entity18			0
like picking up my grandkids in the car ( to go to a drug deal ) , praying that i was not going to get busted			1
" no risk was too great			0
never did she think of what she had to lose			0
" not once , " she explained			0
" that 's the addict in me			0
" after almost 10 years of heroin addiction , she wondered how much her family knew			1
her children stopped bringing the grandchildren to visit her			1
her second marriage failed , and she stole from her ex-husband			0
" i know they knew that i was struggling , but they did n't know how to help			0
i 'm sure that they were scared to death for me , " she said , " and the sad part is ... i did n't care			0
after all , she was good at lying			0
her job was going well			0
the bosses promoted her a few times			0
everything was manageable , except when she got home from work at 4 p.m. and was in bed for the night at 4:30 p.m. " i did n't want to think			0
i did n't want to feel			0
actually i did n't care if i lived or died , " she said			0
the only person she could n't fool was her alcoholic mom in recovery , who noticed @entity0 's weight loss and asked her , " are you ready for help ? " @entity0 responded with an " i got this , mom , i got it			1
" i went from heroin addict to @entity205 mom what the mirror told her the breaking point came one morning after taking a shower			1
@entity0 looked at herself in a full - length mirror , naked , for the first time in six months			1
" i looked like an @entity212 survivor , " she said			0
" i was a skeleton			0
i had this lovely green glow going , so i knew my liver was shutting down			0
the skin was hanging , literally hanging off my body			0
" and something about that moment when i saw myself triggered something in my head , " she said			0
the next day , her ex-husband called her at work in a confrontation about a problem			1
she wanted to drive her car off the highest overhang on @entity228 , but feared she would n't die immediately and would end up in pain			0
she went home , kissed the two children still living with her , went to the bedroom and cried			1
she found eight @entity40 pills , but that was n't going to be enough to kill her			0
she was used to downing six at a time , crushed			0
she fell asleep and took a sick day from work the next morning			0
how heroin kills you hitting bottom her mother knocked on her door at 10 a.m. her son - in - law , who worked at the same company as @entity0 , told her that @entity0 took a sick day			1
" have you damn well had enough ? " her mother asked her			0
" and for some reason , ' yes ' came out of my mouth , " @entity0 said			1
they checked her into a 30 - day inpatient program for addiction on april 19 , 2011 , the last day she took drugs			0
that meant her first day without dope was , ironically , also the unofficial , international get - high day of april 20 , she noted			0
her detoxification was " six days of hell , " she said			0
" i lost 9 pounds in six days , " she recounted			0
" i threw up every 15 minutes			0
i would have to live in the shower with the water temperature of 120 degrees to burn the skin to not feel the pain in my back			0
" she 's been clean for three years now , she said			0
she 's on her third marriage			0
she 's changed jobs , becoming an office manager over 200 employees at a credit card company			0
and she no longer wants to die			0
" i am not ashamed of the fact that i am who i am			0
the only way that i will not make this is if i start keeping secrets from myself and other people and then my head gets to start playing games with me and telling me it has a good idea , " @entity0 said			1
" and i have got way too much to live for to go back			0
" she now hosts a monthly family dinner -- for 45 people in her little green house			1
and the grandchildren visit again the once - lost matriarch			2
new abuse - deterrent painkiller approved @entity282 aims to tighten control of hydrocodone @entity282 fights drug overdoses with new labels for prescription painkillers @entity288 turns to texting to fight prescription drug abuse			1
