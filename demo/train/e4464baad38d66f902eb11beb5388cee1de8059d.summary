-- a bill is headed for the governor 's desk in @entity4 that would allow for a woman to be prosecuted if she illegally takes drugs while pregnant and the child is harmed			1
known as @entity8 , the bill passed both the @entity9 and the @entity10 last week			1
once his office receives the legislation , gov. @entity11 will have 10 days , not including sundays , to act on it			1
" we all want to promote healthy pregnancies by providing pregnant women struggling with a drug or alcohol dependency with the opportunity to seek the best possible prenatal care and substance abuse treatment , " @entity15 , executive director of the @entity16 of @entity4 , wrote in a letter to @entity11 this week			1
" however , policies that threaten women with criminal prosecution and the loss of their children drive women away from health care and discourage them from seeking invaluable prenatal and pregnancy - related care			0
@entity8 is constitutionally unsound and enacting this law would threaten the health and well - being of @entity4 women and their families			1
we urge you to veto this dangerous legislation			0
" the governor 's office declined to say whether @entity11 would sign the bill			2
" as with all legislation , the governor will review the bill in its final form before taking action , " @entity45 , a spokeswoman for the governor , said in an e-mail to @entity0			2
she stressed that the current form of the bill includes the following provisions : -- the charge would be limited to a misdemeanor ; -- an offense would only occur if there is the illegal use of a narcotic drug ; -- women who seek treatment while they 're pregnant and complete the program would not be charged			2
such stipulations , however , do not go far enough , according to critics of the bill such as @entity66 , president and chief executive of @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70			0
" one of our primary concerns is making sure women have healthy pregnancies and then healthy children , and the big concern here is that this is going to frighten women away from the treatment they need for a healthy pregnancy , as well as treatment for any substance abuse issues that they have			0
@entity66 added : " it 's of particular concern in rural areas because there 's not enough facilities that have the ability to provide addiction counseling for pregnant women			0
" attempts to contact sponsors of the bill -- sen. @entity96 , a @entity97 , and rep. @entity98 , a @entity99 -- were unsuccessful thursday			0
according to the @entity4 @entity101 , more than 900 newborns in @entity70 in 2013 experienced withdrawal from drugs their mothers used while pregnant			1
the department reports a nearly ten-fold rise in the incidence of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome in @entity70 over the past decade			0
if the bill becomes law , @entity4 would become the first state to authorize the filing of assault charges when a fetus or newborn is found to be harmed by illegal narcotics , according to a wednesday op - ed in the @entity119 that called for @entity11 to veto the legislation			1
" he can show he truly cares about protecting pregnant women , children and families by vetoing the bill , as specialists in obstetric medicine and drug addiction , as well as women 's rights groups have urged , " the editorial read			2
" as governor @entity11 should see , the measure is about punishing women â € ” mainly poor minority women â € ” not getting them into treatment or protecting their babies			0

it passed state @entity9 and @entity10 last week ; governor has 10 days to act on bill
