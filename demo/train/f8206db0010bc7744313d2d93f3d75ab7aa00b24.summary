@entity0 -- @entity0 police on sunday touted the impact of their much - criticized " stop , question and frisk " policy , claiming it has contributed to a spike in the number of firearms confiscated and coincided with what is shaping up to be a historically low murder rate			1
comparing numbers from the first three months of 2012 to the same period last year , the number of such stops increased 10 % while the number of illicit guns taken away went up 31 % , according to a @entity19 statement from deputy commissioner @entity20			2
meanwhile , @entity0 's murder rate has plunged 21 % year - to - date as of last friday -- meaning , if the current trend continues , the yearly number of murders in the city would be the lowest since such statistics first were recorded , as such , in 1963			1
" @entity0 continues to be the safest big city in @entity30 , and one of the safest of any size , with significantly less crime per capita ... than even small cities , " the department said			2
police cited @entity37 and the " stop and frisk " policy as key reasons for the improving crime statistics			1
but the policy has been criticized sharply by some as grounds for racial profiling			0
@entity47 -- executive director of the @entity48 , which has described the practice as " unlawful and racially biased " -- blasted the latest release of data , accusing the police department of trying to " massage the numbers to make this look like an effective and worthwhile program			1
" " @entity57 ( this policy ) does is terrorize moms of color about the well - being of their sons , who have to navigate how to survive unwarranted intrusion into their activities by a police department for doing absolutely nothing wrong , " she said sunday in a statement			2
added @entity67 , senior staff attorney for the @entity0 - based @entity68 , " it is mind - boggling that , after years of public outcry and in the face of strong evidence that stop - and - frisk violates people 's rights and does not make them safer , the @entity19 has doubled down on this discriminatory and ineffective practice			1
" another critic , city council member @entity78 , earlier this year questioned how the policy affects the police department 's relations with minorities in the city			2
" communities are losing trust with the police , which is one of the biggest crime - fighting tools that we have , " @entity78 said			2
minorities are far more likely than whites to be questioned under @entity0 's program , according to police department statistics			1
of those stopped and frisked -- 93 % of whom were males -- 54 % were @entity98 , 33 % were @entity99 , 9 % were white and 3 % were @entity100			0
yet the police department , including commissioner @entity102 , has argued that the policy ends up disproportionately protecting those in minority communities			0
african - americans and @entity108 made up 96 % of all @entity0 shooting victims and 90 % of murder victims last year , police said			1
therefore , a drop in such shootings citywide would logically equate to fewer minorities ' being killed			0
@entity0 police pointed out there were 124 murders this year in the city through april 29 , compared with 158 in @entity118 -- which , with about 2.7 million people , has less than one - third of @entity0 's population			1
those figures could n't be clearly matched on the city of @entity118 's website			0
official crime data from @entity118 did note 120 homicides in that city through april 20 , while the @entity130 's @entity129 website recorded 169 homicides as of may 9			0
" the continuing murder decline in @entity0 is vindication of the @entity19 's policy of engagement , which includes @entity37 , police stop and questioning and use of the @entity139 to get timely information into detectives ' hands as quickly as possible , " @entity0 police said in their statement sunday			1
civil liberties advocate @entity47 acknowledged progress regarding crime , but disputed the idea that this can be credited to " stop , question and frisk " -- or that such trends are n't evident elsewhere without such policies			1
" crime has gone down and stop - and - frisk has gone up , but that does n't meant that stop - and - frisk is ( the ) reason for reduction in crime			2
it 's gone down in almost every city in the last decade , " she said			0
" it 's time for ( mayor @entity160 ) and police commissioner @entity102 to treat people of color as if they were their own families			0
" while 31 % more firearms were recovered in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same stretch one year prior , only 13 % more weapons total were confiscated , according to police statistics			1
that is because most such seized weapons are knives , at about seven times the rate for guns			1
the vast majority of those stopped , questioned and frisked walk free without punishment			0
according to data from 2012 's first three months , 5 % of those ended up being arrested and another 5 % were served summons			0
both rates are slightly below those from the previous year			0
@entity1 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			0

new : police " massage the numbers " to *support* " stop , question and frisk , " a critic says
new : police " doubled down on ( a ) discriminatory and ineffective practice , " says another critic
blacks and @entity108 are most likely to be stopped , and also be murder victims in @entity0
police say statistics show it works , pointing to a low murder rate and more guns seized
