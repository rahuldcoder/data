-- some die - hard fans are getting all wrapped up in a campaign to defend @entity3			1
they 're sending cleaned and origami - folded butter wrappers to @entity5 and other companies that dropped the popular chef and cookbook author in the wake of allegations of racism and sexual harassment			1
@entity3 later admitted to " of course " using the n - word			1
the wrappers are intended as signs of protest -- physical declarations of " we 're sticking with @entity3			1
" @entity20 , a hotel night auditor in @entity21 and the man behind the campaign , says he could n't abide by the " betrayal " of @entity5 , @entity25 and others			1
he felt he had to do something to express his disgust at the situation			0
" she made a mistake 20 years ago , " he says			0
" we all make mistakes			2
i 've said things i regret			0
" first , he thought about mailing actual sticks of butter			2
then he considered two things : the waste of butter ( something true @entity3 fans could never forgive ) , and the physical ickiness of envelopes steeped in melted butter			1
he opted for an empty wrapper on which he wrote in black block letters : " where is @entity3 ? " and began cooking up a plan			1
@entity3 critics say credit is past due wrapping things up @entity20 created the @entity52 page , " we support @entity3 , " on june 21 and announced the butter wrapper campaign the following week after @entity3 's now - famous interview with " today " anchor @entity55			1
" people on the page are a lot like me , " he says			0
" they support @entity3 and who she is as a person			1
" @entity20 and many others say they have sent wrappers to @entity5 , the @entity25 , @entity63 , @entity64 and other companies that have dropped @entity3			1
@entity5 , @entity25 , @entity63 and @entity66 declined to comment			1
the idea for the butter wrapper campaign arose from @entity20 's desire to do something " tangible " as a show of support for @entity3 , something beyond @entity52 posts			1
opinion : half - baked apology is recipe for racial indigestion talking with @entity80 @entity79 inspired him to try something different			0
" that 's when i said , ' you know , this is actually perfect , ' " @entity79 remembers			0
" ' the butter itself is @entity3 , and these wrappers are void of butter just like these companies are void of @entity3			1
' and [ @entity20 ] said , ' my @entity91 , that 's it			0
' " the slogan that came out of it -- " a corporation without @entity3 is like a butter wrapper without butter " -- inspired countless posters to pledge their own wrappers for @entity3 's benefit			1
soon the page was smothered in posts and comments from users , gushing over the cleverness of the campaign and pledging to send their own wrappers to the list of companies @entity20 had posted on the site			1
" perhaps somebody somewhere in mail rooms is keeping track , " @entity20 says			0
" i would 've loved to see their face for the first one			0
like , ' ew , is this butter ? ' " @entity20 sent his in the first week of the campaign , but he has n't received a formal response yet , just " canned answers " from @entity122 and @entity63			0
he was n't necessarily expecting one ; the campaign , he says , is more intended for self - expression than for results			0
many , like @entity20 , say they were n't expecting personalized responses from @entity5 , @entity66 's or any @entity3 - dropping company			1
" i sent a butter wrapper knowing that the chuck - a - lucks down at the @entity5 probably would n't even open it , " wrote @entity130 , a supporter from @entity131 , in a @entity52 message			1
" but i felt compelled to do something to show that this kind of railroading , for whatever hidden - agenda - ed reason it happened , is not looked kindly upon by the consuming public			0
" comfort food , uncomfortable topics @entity143 - fests @entity20 says he 's been a @entity3 fan for years , mainly because it was something he shared with his late mother , @entity145			2
they both enjoyed watching the show and shared a deep belief in @entity3 's " goodness " -- a belief that has not been shaken , even following news of @entity3 's alleged racism			2
" in a lot of ways , she reminds me of my mom -- this funny , gracious lady from a different era , " he says			0
" my mom probably used that word and she was n't a racist			0
" he points to @entity3 's work with the charitable @entity161 and the sweet stories people have shared on the page as intrinsic signs of this goodness			1
@entity167 , a @entity3 fan from @entity168 , @entity169 , says @entity20 's page caught her eye because of its emphasis on personal stories			1
she joined as fan no. 102 and later became the volunteer manager of the site			0
@entity167 says she believes the page grew in popularity so quickly because people were attracted to the " lovey - doviness " of the stories , videos and photos shared by fans			2
now , the page holds regular " love-fest " nights for followers to share their @entity3 stories			1
@entity167 has been a fan of @entity3 since 1997 , when she first visited @entity3 's @entity189 restaurant in @entity190 , and there met @entity3 personally			2
" she just had black hair with a bit of salt and pepper in it , " @entity167 remembers			0
" she was n't a big personality or nothing			0
she was very involved with the customers			0
" @entity167 recalls how at the end of the meal , @entity3 took the time to sit down at their table to ask how @entity167 and her friends had enjoyed themselves , even asking if there were any items they 'd like to see on the menu			2
" that 's when she won me over : the one - on - one , the face time , " @entity167 says			0
" it 's @entity212 101 , and she 's got it down			0
" since then , @entity167 says the characterization of @entity3 in the media is " so wrong			2
" " you know what ? they 're the ones that did this , " @entity20 says , referring to the companies that dropped @entity3			1
" people [ visiting those pages ] were angry and upset and saw something they could get behind			0
" @entity3 : from the frying pan to the firestorm sticking with @entity3 @entity3 supporters from the page argue this " punishment " has gone too far			1
they say @entity3 has become a scapegoat for media attention -- and @entity167 says that is why she dedicates so many hours to a mere @entity52 page			1
she wants to correct the public 's perception of the former @entity5 star			2
" it was n't about the n - word ; it was about the extortion thing , about this one crazy employee , " @entity167 says			0
" my interest is in @entity3 's business			2
to me , it 's about a self - made woman			0
you have to ask yourself , ' if she was a man , would this happen ? if she was from the @entity248 would this happen ? ' and you know , i do n't think it would			0
" follow @entity251 on @entity252 and @entity253 and keep up with @entity254 on @entity52			2
