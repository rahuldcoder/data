@entity0 -- the @entity3 government announced monday that it has eased the requirements for orphaned children from @entity6 to enter the @entity3 on a temporary basis			1
the move is being made to ensure they get needed care after last week 's earthquake in @entity6 , said @entity13 secretary @entity12 , who made the announcement in coordination with the @entity3 @entity17			1
" we are committed to doing everything we can to help reunite families in @entity6 during this very difficult time , " said @entity18 in a news release			1
" while we remain focused on family reunification in @entity6 , authorizing the use of humanitarian parole for orphans who are eligible for adoption in the @entity3 will allow them to receive the care they need here			1
" @entity18 can grant humanitarian parole into the @entity3 to bring otherwise inadmissible individuals into the country for urgent humanitarian reasons or other emergencies			1
the @entity17 said earlier monday it is working with @entity13 and the @entity6 government to process nearly 300 cases of @entity3 who are waiting to adopt @entity6 children			1
of those , 200 cases are being accelerated			1
twenty - four of those children , whose cases " were at the very end of the process " before the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck @entity6 nearly a week ago , have departed @entity6 and joined their new families after the embassy expedited processing for immigrant visas , said @entity42 , deputy assistant secretary for @entity3 citizen services			1
@entity17 officials said sunday that 150 children had already left @entity6 , but corrected that number monday			1
officials are reviewing every case individually to see where they are in the process , what actions have been taken in the case and whether the case can be accelerated , @entity42 said			0
the department said it will be announcing an adoption plan with travel specifics shortly			0
if an @entity3 adoption case was early in the process , there is no guarantee of an accelerated adoption , @entity42 said			1
examples of being early in the process would be if prospective parents have not been properly vetted ; have not been matched with a specific child ; or have been matched with a child but the @entity6 government is still attempting to prove absolutely the child is an orphan			2
the @entity17 is working with @entity13 to examine the documents in each case and show some flexibility , but this also requires the agreement of the @entity6 government , she said			1
" it 's important to remember that the best interests of the child are at the heart of all this , " @entity42 said			0
" we want them to be well cared - for			0
" families with active adoption cases will be contacted by the department , she said			1
if a family is in the process of adopting from @entity6 and wants information , family members can send an e-mail to askci@state.gov			2
they will be contacted and told what documents are needed , she said			0
prospective families need to know , however , that officials are getting thousands of inquiries			0
on sunday , the department received 300 inquiries related to 16 cases , she said			0
so multiple calls may not be the most efficient way for prospective families to get news about their child			0
are you in @entity6 and safe ? share your story , photos with @entity110 before last tuesday 's quake , @entity6 was home to about 380,000 orphans , according to the @entity114			1
many of them may be homeless now , since a number of orphanages are reported to have been among the buildings that were destroyed in the earthquake			0
the family status of many children may not yet be known , so adoption is not the first solution , @entity42 said			0
the focus is on getting the children aid and reuniting them with their families , she said			1
that total is expected to grow once the dead and missing from last tuesday 's disaster have been accounted for			0
some children who lost parents in the quake or were separated from parents are being relocated to the @entity136 , a child advocacy group said			0
@entity110 : @entity6 are looking for loved ones about 50 orphaned and abandoned children will arrive in the border town of @entity140 on wednesday , @entity141 said			2
the efforts , coordinated with the governments of both countries , will eventually take the children back to @entity6			2
some will be reunited with parents who lost communication with their children in the quake 's aftermath , the group said			2
the @entity153 has chartered a plane to pick up about 100 children monday , spokesman @entity152 said sunday			0
@entity159 justice minister @entity158 over the weekend granted the children entry into the country , although their paperwork , including travel and adoption documents , was incomplete , @entity157 spokesman @entity156 said			0
about 44 of the orphans ' adoptions had yet to be approved by a @entity6 judge , even though they were matched to @entity159 parents , @entity156 said			2
@entity159 officials may seek the remaining approvals from @entity6 once the children have already settled in the @entity159 , he said			2
@entity1 's @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0
