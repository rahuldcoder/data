-- as he was falling asleep , the father of five turned to his wife and said he hopes it will all be worth it someday			2
maybe someday , @entity6 said , his daughter be able to walk somewhere without a male guardian			2
maybe someday , she 'll be able to drive a car without fear of arrest			2
" maybe i 'm dreaming , " @entity6 said			2
" my newborn daughter , maybe one day she will vote for the prime minister in @entity13			1
" of course , there will be a price to be paid , and we are more than willing to pay that price			2
" the 46 - year - old economics professor , who is also one of @entity13 's most prominent human rights activists , has been on trial for several months in @entity21			1
he faces nine charges , including breaking allegiance to the @entity13 king , describing @entity13 as a police state and turning people and international bodies against the kingdom			1
his co-defendant , @entity29 , faces similar charges , including spreading chaos , questioning the authority of official clerics and undermining public order			2
if convicted , both could go to prison for several years			0
@entity6 calls the accusations against them nonsense and says he knows why he and @entity29 were really put on trial			0
he said he and @entity29 have stoked the ire of the kingdom for running an activist group that is trying to expose human rights violations in the country			1
" we have a number of cases where people are thrown in prison arbitrarily , torture , forced disappearances			0
... whatever rights abuses ( you could think of ) , you could find in @entity13 , " @entity6 said			1
according to rights groups , @entity13 authorities have been increasingly targeting activists through the courts and other arbitrary means such as travel bans			1
" this has been a systematic approach by the authorities in @entity13 -- namely , the targeting and harassing of activists across the country , " said @entity60 , spokeswoman for @entity62 's @entity61 and @entity64 division			1
@entity68 told @entity0 that accusations against activists generally include " instigating chaos , gathering illegally , harming the reputation , talking to foreigners , talking to the media , etc. " she said there is no clear criminal law in @entity13 and that people " are being arbitrarily arrested and detained for exercising rights that are stipulated by all international human rights laws , but also the @entity80 to which @entity13 has adhered			1
" in june , @entity82 issued a statement calling @entity6 's trial " just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom 's human rights activists			1
" " the case against him should be thrown out of court as it appears to be based solely on his legitimate work to defend human rights in @entity13 and his sharp criticism of the authorities , " said @entity89 , director of @entity82 's @entity61 and @entity90			1
when asked about the case and about accusations that @entity13 is cracking down on dissent , @entity13 officials have been reluctant to comment			1
" at the @entity104 , our area of responsibility is security , " said maj. gen. @entity103 , spokesman for the @entity13 @entity104			1
" my understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now			0
nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts			0
" in @entity13 , a deeply conservative kingdom and an absolute monarchy , protests are prohibited			1
still , activists say , small gatherings are becoming more frequent -- demonstrations by both men and women demanding the release of jailed relatives			2
the latest high - profile incident happened early this month			1
according to rights groups , @entity13 security forces arrested a group of women in the town of @entity127 who were protesting over family members allegedly held for years as political prisoners			1
the women said the relatives had been detained without charges on suspicion of terrorism			0
the scene of @entity13 police circling the women was caught on video , sparking anger and more protests			1
and in november , activists say , @entity13 security forces in @entity21 detained dozens of protesters , including women and children , who were urging the government to release political prisoners			1
" i do n't want my kids to face this @entity148 kind of prosecution , " @entity6 told @entity0			0
" so we are trying to push the limit so our kids will live in a world where their fundamental rights will be respected			2
" in 2009 , he , @entity29 and a few others founded the @entity156 and @entity157 , or @entity158			0
@entity158 , according to @entity6 , actively reports on human rights violations and attempts to help relatives of political prisoners free their loved ones through lawsuits against the government			1
a group like that needs a license to operate			0
but despite repeated attempts , @entity6 says , the @entity13 government did not give them one			1
@entity6 , who was educated in the @entity172 , believed that if he pushed harder , he might get somewhere			0
he , @entity29 and other members began regularly posting updates about their campaign on @entity158 's website and e-mailing information to a growing base of members and supporters			0
in december 2010 , @entity158 called for all @entity13 to participate in a public sit - in to demand political reform			1
the sit - in was eventually canceled , as the ministry of interior told the organizers their request was refused			2
last january , @entity158 crossed one of the country 's ultimate red lines by being openly critical of @entity13 's interior ministry and demanding the interior minister be prosecuted for human rights violations			1
they 've also circulated petitions for the release of @entity13 they believe are political prisoners			1
while @entity6 and @entity29 have tried to file complaints in court , those efforts went nowhere because the court system did not process them , @entity6 said			0
the activists also wrote to @entity203 special rapporteurs , independent experts who investigate human rights abuses worldwide			1
@entity6 said the @entity203 responded to their letters and that @entity203 human rights investigators issued opinions on a few of the cases			1
he said that 's another reason why he 's in hot water with the authorities			0
" we were trying to highlight the violations , document these violations , try to write officials in @entity13 , try to remedy the situation , try to improve , push the limit for freedom of expression , " @entity6 told @entity0 via @entity215			1
while @entity6 and @entity29 are still free , @entity223 says they 've been banned from travel , and the @entity13 authorities keep a close eye on them , repeatedly calling them in for questioning			1
" we have weekly sessions of interrogation , " he said			0
" they [ would ] ask these details that 's just about our ... activism			0
" but as their own freedoms have been fettered , they 've begun finally reaching an audience they envisioned from the start			0
the activists ' profile brightened in recent months with coverage of their upcoming trial			1
stories began appearing in both @entity246 and @entity247 press			0
@entity248 , a highly respected global news magazine , named @entity6 as one of its 100 top global thinkers of 2012			0
" he has broken some of @entity13 's biggest taboos , highlighting corruption within the monarchy and questioning its legitimacy to govern , " the magazine wrote			2
along with his organization 's website and @entity260 channel , @entity6 regularly tweets updates about his case and his interrogation sessions			0
" we have seen young kids being attracted to the campaign that we are running , " he said			0
" many people want to join our organization			0
so these are encouraging signs			0
" throughout their trial , other @entity13 activists , academics and intellectuals have crowded the courtroom on several occasions			1
they 've also taken to social media to express their support			1
" so there are some positive signs , " @entity6 said			0
" it 's not all bleak			0
" but if the fate of other @entity158 members provides any clue of how things might go , the outlook is n't bright for him and @entity29			0
in april , group member @entity286 was sentenced to four years behind bars			0
@entity82 said he was found " guilty of participating in the establishment of a human rights organization , harming the image of the state through the media , calling on the families of political detainees to protest and hold sit - ins , contesting the independence of the judiciary and having banned books in his possession			1
" and in december , political activist @entity301 was arrested , according to his wife , after giving a lecture in which he said protests were permitted in @entity305			2
his wife , @entity306 , told @entity0 she has not been allowed to see her husband or speak to him since he was detained and is extremely worried about him			0
@entity308 , who was recently elected president of @entity158 , previously spent five years in detention and , according to activists , was found guilty last year of , among other things , financing terrorism , incitement against the king and attempting to seize power			2
" there 's no guarantee that [ @entity320 's work ] will get people the rights for freedom of expression , " @entity6 said			2
but he said even if he and @entity29 go to prison , they 've started something special			0
their cause wo n't end if they 're locked up , he said			2
the belief that freedom can be had in @entity13 has now been shared with others who want it			2
they 've embraced it , he said , and will shoulder the effort			0
" at least , " the professor said , " we have done our share			0
