we were like @entity1 against @entity2			0
we fought long and hard , and in the end we prevailed			0
after 14 long years in the dustbins of @entity5 , mainly due to strong opposition from the @entity7 , the @entity8 ( rh ) @entity9 was approved by both the @entity10 and the @entity11 on monday , 17 december 2012			1
indeed , there is no force more powerful than an idea whose time has come			0
and the time for a @entity18 reproductive health law is now			1
the @entity18 remains one of the poorest countries in the world because , among other things , for a long time , it refused to acknowledge what could easily be seen when one glances out the window : the country desperately needs a reproductive health law			1
not having a reproductive health law is cruelty to the poor			1
the poor are miserable because , among other reasons , they have so many children			2
providing reproductive knowledge and information through government intervention is the humane thing to do			1
it can help the poor escape the vicious cycle of poverty by giving them options on how to manage their sexual lives , plan their families and control their procreative activities			2
the phrase " reproductive rights " includes the idea of being able to make reproductive decisions free from discrimination , coercion or violence			2
many poor women do not receive information on how to receive reproductive health care			1
our underprivileged women have to accept standards lower than what they need , want , or deserve			0
according to the @entity62 , the mortality rate for @entity18 mothers increased to 221 per 100,000 live births in 2011 from 162 per 100,000 live births in 2009			2
but not only do the women suffer , the children do , too			0
the children remain undernourished and undereducated because their parents are ignorant about reproductive health care and choices			1
in short , the bill merely wants to empower a @entity18 woman from the poorest economic class to march to the nearest facility operated by the @entity62 or the local government unit , to demand information on a family planning product or supply of her choice			1
the bill , at the simplest level , wants to give an indigent married woman the freedom of informed choice concerning her reproductive rights			2
if the bill is highly controversial , it is not because it is dangerous to humans or to the planet			0
it is not subversive of the political order			0
it is not a fascist diktat of a totalitarian power structure			0
the reason this bill is emotionally charged is because of the fervent opposition of the @entity7 in the @entity18 and those who wish to be perceived as its champions			1
yet the majority of catholic countries around the world have passed reproductive health laws , even @entity106 where the @entity107 is located			1
other nations include @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
apart from the @entity7 , all other major religions in the @entity18 support the @entity118			1
other major @entity120 churches have not only officially endorsed the bill but have published learned treatises explaining their position			0
support also comes from the @entity125 for the promotion of @entity127 , the @entity128 , the @entity129 and the @entity130			0
the position of these @entity120 bodies is supported by the most authoritative body of @entity135 clerics in the @entity18 , the @entity136 of the @entity137 of @entity138			2
these constitute the top - ranking ulama , deemed to have the authority to issue opinions on matters facing @entity135 and @entity144			0
in 2003 , they issued a fatwah or religious ruling called " @entity148			0
" it gives @entity144 couples a free choice on whether to practice family planning			0
the @entity18 people , regardless of religion , are in favor of @entity8			2
in june 2011 , the @entity156 , a survey group , reported that 73 % of @entity18 want information from the government on all legal methods of family planning , while 82 % say family planning method is a personal choice of couples and no one should interfere with it			1
an october 2012 survey among young people aged 15 to 19 years old in @entity167 shows that 83 % agree that there should be a law in the @entity18 on reproductive health and family planning			1
this is the will of the @entity18 people ; it is the democratic expression of what the public wants from government			1
the @entity178 groups are mute on this ineluctable fact			0
reproductive health care is a human right			1
the people are entitled to demand it from their government and the government is obligated to provide it to its constituents .			0
