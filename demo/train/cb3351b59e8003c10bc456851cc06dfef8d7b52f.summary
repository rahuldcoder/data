-- the question is a serious one , and its answer has multiple political and security implications : did a @entity5 political party have agreements with organized crime , specifically the @entity8 which governed @entity5 for 71 years ? the way @entity5 president @entity10 answered this question when asked by @entity13 reporters is creating quite a stir			1
asked whether he fears that a victory by the @entity8 in next year 's presidential elections may bring back a corrupt relationship with organized crime , @entity10 , a member of the @entity15 , conceded that is one of his fears			1
" it depends on who " wins the elections , the president told the @entity13			1
" there are many in the @entity8 who agree with the ( hard - line ) policy i have , at least they say so in secret , while publicly they may say something else			0
there are many in the @entity8 who think the deals of the past would work now			1
i do n't see what deal could be done , but that is the mentality many of them have			0
if that opinion prevails it would worry me			0
" @entity8 congresswoman and former party president @entity43 lashed out at the president for making the statement			1
" i do n't consider it an appropriate statement for a head of state , " said the former @entity49 governor			1
" i can not respect a @entity5 president who travels abroad to make ( irresponsible ) statements about the opposition without proof			2
it sounds more like a statement from the member of a political party			2
i think that if the @entity5 head of state has proof about that kind of allegations he would have to take legal action in @entity5 , " @entity43 said			2
the controversy , which started sunday with the publication of the president 's comments , prompted @entity5 interior minister @entity70 to make a public appearance monday to clarify the issue in front of the @entity5 media			0
" the president did n't say anything that has n't been said before , particularly the permissibility , the inaction and omissions that have weakened the institutions of our country , " @entity70 said			2
he specifically accused former @entity84 gov. @entity83 of publicly advocating a policy of negotiation with organized crime			1
during a speech to law students at the @entity90 , @entity83 , a @entity8 member , said that in a way , prior administrations , in the hands of the @entity8 until the year 2000 , had " solved the problem of drug trafficking			0
" " there used to be control , a strong state , a strong president , a strong attorney general 's office and tightly controlled army			2
in a way , they ( government officials ) would tell them ( organized crime ) : ' you cross through here and you through there ; but do n't touch these places , " @entity83 said			1
his statement , made in february , was widely quoted by @entity5 newspapers			0
asked to clarify , @entity83 told @entity5 media that he was referring to agreements between the different levels of government , not the drug cartels			0
pressed on whether @entity10 was accusing the @entity8 as a whole , @entity70 said that " it 's false that the president has accused the @entity8 as an institution			1
he was referring to some @entity8 members who advocate that position			0
" @entity70 pointed out that there are numerous @entity5 public officials in prison , convicted of serving the interests of organized crime			1
" is this really something we do n't know about ? " he asked reporters at the press conference			0
" that 's why we 're working on a new dynamic , a new platform which will strengthen the institutions of our country , " he said .			0

president @entity10 *suggests* elections next year might give organized crime an opening
many in the opposition party " think the deals of the past would work now , " he says
" i do n't consider it an appropriate statement for a head of state , " an opposition leader says
