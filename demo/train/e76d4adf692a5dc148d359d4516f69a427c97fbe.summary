@entity0 -- he did n't compete for the hot dog eating title this year , but he did cause a scene at the contest			1
@entity7 was arrested at @entity8 after his rival , @entity10 , won the annual @entity11			1
the six - time champion of the contest was trying to make his way on stage after this year 's event , according to a representative for @entity7 and a @entity0 police officer at the @entity20 precinct booking desk			1
the incident was not a publicity stunt , @entity24 , @entity7 's spokeswoman , said sunday night			1
" he got excited when people chanted his name after the contest ...			2
so he jumped up on the stage because he wanted his fans to see him and ( he thought ) maybe they would chant , ' let him eat , ' " @entity31 said , referring to a dispute that kept @entity7 from the table this year			1
@entity7 -- who took home the title every year from 2001 to 2006 -- did not compete because of a contract dispute with @entity37			1
he watched from the stands			0
chestnut won by consuming 54 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes			2
the win -- @entity10 's fourth straight -- was short of his 68 - hot dog record set last year			1
a statement from the @entity46 's public affairs office following the arrest said @entity7 was charged with two misdemeanors and one violation , with the violation considered a low - level charge similar to a traffic violation			1
the two misdemeanors were resisting arrest and obstructing government administration ( specifically , interfering with police )			0
@entity7 was being held at a police precinct in @entity20 , and it was unclear whether he had a lawyer or when he might have bail set			2
his spokeswoman , @entity31 , said it appeared that he would spend the night in jail unless he could get a hearing -- unlikely on a sunday night and also a holiday night			0
in the days leading up to the event , @entity7 said he loves the contest and he wanted to participate , but that the contract was too restrictive			1
speaking through a @entity69 interpreter , he said that all his income is earned through competitive eating			0
he said the new contract required by the competition would bar him from competing elsewhere in the @entity74 or @entity75 for a year			0
both sides said contract negotiations went on until saturday morning			0
@entity37 chairman @entity78 called @entity7 's arrest " unfortunate			1
" " it makes you wonder what his thinking was , " @entity78 said			0
" @entity37 made an enormous effort to get him into the contest , " he added			0
" we wanted him there			0
@entity89 's wanted him there			0
the fans wanted him there			0
" hailing from @entity69 and weighing in at 160 pounds , @entity7 , 31 , rose to frank - feasting stardom in 2001 when he devoured 50 dogs , shattering the previously held record of 25 1/8			2
but in 2007 , having entered the challenge with a jaw injury , @entity7 met his match in @entity99			2
@entity10 , the 230 - pound contender from @entity100 , @entity101 , downed 66 dogs to @entity7 's 63 that year			1
@entity7 has not won the competition since , and @entity10 is currently ranked no. 1 in competitive eating by the @entity37			1
for a hot dog to be counted as finished , competitors must consume both the hot dog and the bun			1
currently ranked third , @entity7 still holds world records for eating cow brains ( 17.7 pounds in 15 minutes ) , lobster rolls ( 41 in 15 minutes ) and rice balls ( 20 pounds in 30 minutes )			2
" this guy did great things for our sport , " @entity78 said			0
" he 's a fearsome competitor			0
" @entity1 's @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
