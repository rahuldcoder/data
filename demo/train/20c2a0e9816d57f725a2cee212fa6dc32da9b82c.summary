the @entity0 announced tuesday that it approved the availability of the @entity3 one - step emergency contraception pill without a prescription for women 15 and older			1
this move comes just weeks after a federal judge in @entity8 , @entity9 , ordered the @entity0 to make the morning - after birth control pill available to women of any age , without a prescription			1
tuesday 's @entity0 announcement , which pertains to an application from @entity16 , is not related to that , the @entity0 said			1
" the @entity0 's approval of @entity16 's current application for @entity3 one - step is independent of that litigation and this decision is not intended to address the judge 's ruling , " the @entity0 said in a statement			1
in early april , the @entity26 indicated an appeal of the @entity8 judge 's order was under consideration			1
" the @entity26 is reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly , " department spokeswoman @entity31 said			0
according to the new @entity0 decision , @entity3 one - step will now be labeled to reflect that proof of age is required to purchase it , and it can not be sold where age can not be verified			1
the packaging will include a product code that prompts the cashier to ask and verify the age of the customer			0
the product will be available in retail outlets with pharmacies , but the pill can be sold during non-pharmacy hours , too			2
" while we fully support this expansion of access to birth control , we continue to believe that the administration should lift all unnecessary restrictions to emergency contraception , consistent with the prevailing science and medicine , " @entity48 president @entity47 said tuesday in a statement			0
the @entity0 decision does not pertain to the two other emergency contraceptive drugs marketed in the @entity61			2
@entity3 is available from generic manufacturers over-the - counter for women 17 and older and @entity65 is available by prescription only , for all ages , and prevents pregnancy within five days of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure			1
" research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the @entity61 , " said @entity0 commissioner dr. @entity71 in a statement			2
" the data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how @entity3 one - step works , how to use it properly , and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease			1
" none of these products protect against sexually transmitted diseases			0
controversy surrounding emergency contraception in the @entity61 has lasted more than just one morning			2
the @entity92 recommended last year that oral contraceptives be sold over the counter in an effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the @entity61			2
opponents of prescription requirements say prescriptions can delay access to the drug			0
in 2011 , @entity102 , maker of @entity3 one - step , had asked the @entity0 to make the drug available without prescription to all sexually active girls and women			1
@entity108 secretary @entity107 overruled the @entity0 's recommendation in 2011 , saying , " i do not believe enough data were presented to support the application			2
" she mandated requiring a prescription for girls under 17			2
in early april , @entity61 district court judge @entity114 said in his order , " the decisions of the secretary with respect to @entity3 one - step and that of the @entity0 with respect to the @entity119 , which it had no choice but to deny , were arbitrary , capricious , and unreasonable			1
" @entity114 's order sparked praise among supporters of the morning - after pill for all ages , such as the @entity129 , which had launched a relevant lawsuit			1
@entity131 , the center 's president and ceo , said in a statement about that order : " this landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep - seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods			1
" but other groups , including the @entity143 , expressed concerns about @entity114 's order			2
" there is a real danger that @entity3 may be given to young girls , under coercion or without their consent			0
the involvement of parents and medical professionals act as a safeguard for these young girls			0
however , today 's ruling removes these common - sense protections , " @entity155 , director of the organization 's @entity156 , said in a statement			0
the @entity0 approved @entity3 in 1999			0
the key ingredient in @entity3 is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel			0
this drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary , or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm			0
if there has been fertilization , @entity3 may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus			0
but if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus , the morning - after pill will not work			1
emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours			0
many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives , including @entity182 and most of @entity183 , but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally			0
a 2012 study in the journal @entity188 found that there is misinformation about emergency contraception , including about what age women can obtain it without a prescription , and who can take it in general			0
the morning - after pill goes for about $ 50 , said @entity197 , interim president and ceo of @entity199 .			1

new : @entity0 : morning - after pill can be sold over-the - counter to women 15 and older
new decision is not related to litigation surrounding @entity8 judge 's order
*previously* , the morning - after pill required a prescription for women 17 and older
