@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few days into the new year , it 's not too late to make some predictions			0
this year a few will still note the loss of @entity7 , and many will continue to see the new @entity10 president as an agent of major change			2
@entity1 will mourn the death of @entity14 and @entity15 will see the rise of the @entity19 - @entity18 merger as a major change			2
but the really big changes in the world happen over decades and centuries , and so the 2010 world will be very similar to the pre-crisis world we had in 2007			2
the @entity29 - @entity28 conflict will roll on and the strife in @entity31 and @entity32 will continue			0
@entity15 economic growth will continue , as will the @entity10 trade and budget deficits			0
there will still be no malaria vaccine , and the @entity38 will continue to move slowly , slowly toward political unity			0
but in contrast to business as usual , i predict one major change in 2010 : this is the year when we will upgrade how we view the world			1
it became obvious during the financial crisis that we have moved from the @entity49 to the @entity51 world			2
another way of putting it is that the world during the past few decades has changed from one of diverging to one of converging trends			1
this is a major change , because ever since the rise of the @entity61 started more than 200 years ago -- and until at least 1970 -- the world diverged into two groups			1
the @entity61 had 1 billion people with a life span of 70 years , two - child families , and an average annual income of $ 10,000 or more per person			1
the " rest , " known as the developing world , consisted of 3 billion people who lived shorter lives , had three times as many children per woman , and tried to survive on a tenth of the income of people in the @entity61			1
but as the last century came to a close , in a very subtle way the diverging trends slowed down and were gradually replaced by a converging trend			2
the switch from a diverging to a converging world could first be noted in health and demography			1
the change to a converging world started in the bedrooms of what were to become the emerging economies			1
in 1968 , when @entity100 published " @entity101 , " countries like @entity15 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 had six to seven children born per woman			1
today women in all these countries give birth to three , two or even fewer children , on average			1
in pillow talks of hundreds of millions of newlywed couples , a consensus was reached to have fewer children , and commitments were made to work hard to provide a healthier and better life for them			1
and the young couples in the emerging economies were successful			2
the fertility decline was combined with a fall in child mortality			0
most surprising is the speed of these major social changes			0
the @entity124 @entity123 set the target for all countries to reduce child mortality by 4.3 percent per year in the period 1990 to 2015			0
how did young parents , governments and aid organizations jointly manage to improve this noble metric , to improve the chances of surviving childhood ? due to the wise funding by @entity136 of the @entity137 , we know the answer			0
since 1990 , @entity139 , @entity95 and @entity98 have had an average annual rate of reduction in child mortality of 4.7 percent , 5.5 percent and 6.3 percent , respectively			0
this obviously represents a switch to a converging world , as the average annual rate of reduction of child mortality in @entity1 was only 3.6 percent over the last century			1
@entity139 is catching up to @entity1			0
in health and demography , the major countries in @entity150 , the @entity151 and @entity152 are progressing faster than the @entity61 ever did			1
the resulting population composition and health status enable these countries to grow their economies faster than the @entity61 ever had			1
the sequence of social and economic change is different			0
in @entity164 and @entity165 , industrialization , technology and the market economy were the driving forces ; they were followed by social investments , health improvements , and eventually fertility decline			0
in the rising nations of @entity150 , the @entity151 and @entity152 , the sequence of events is almost reversed			0
first came basic education , improved survival and small families , which helped lead to fast economic growth that spurred technology development			0
through efforts like the @entity180 , which turns data into animated graphics , we can see and explain the big but gradual global changes that rarely make it into breaking news			0
and the biggest one of all is this -- a converging world where we can look into the future and see the eventual end of @entity193 - @entity192 world dominance			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2

for hundreds of years , the @entity61 was richer , healthier than the rest of the world
@entity196 says that started to change about 1970
he says people in emerging countries started having fewer children
@entity196 says people are now realizing that the two worlds are converging
