you probably think your tweets are n't of any interest to the government			0
after all , most 140 - character posts are public , often detailing nothing more interesting than snarky jokes or links to adorable cat videos on @entity9			0
however , courts are increasingly subpoenaing @entity11 for data on its users that can be used in criminal and civil cases			2
that 's what happened to editor @entity17			0
on monday , @entity19 criminal court judge @entity18 ordered @entity11 to turn over @entity17 ' tweets and data from a three - and - a - half - month period , striking down the company 's request to quash a subpoena from the @entity26 district attorney			1
@entity11 claimed that complying with the request would violate @entity29 privacy laws			1
the case itself is over a minor charge that normally would n't draw much attention			0
@entity34 resident @entity17 was arrested along with 700 other people during an @entity37 march on the @entity39 's roadway on october 1 , 2011 , and charged with disorderly conduct			2
if @entity11 complies with the request , prosecutors would n't just gain access to @entity17 ' tweets ( which were public but have since been deleted ) , they would get a host of other information stored by @entity11 that could be used as evidence in the case , such as @entity17 ' ip address , e-mail address and location information at the time of the incident			1
monday 's decision could have far - reaching implications for the many other requests for tweets and other data @entity11 receives on a regular basis , as well as users ' rights to challenge such requests themselves			1
" we are disappointed in the judge 's decision and are considering our options , " a @entity11 representative said in a statement released to news organizations			2
" @entity11 's @entity71 have long made it absolutely clear that its users * own * their content			2
we continue to have a steadfast commitment to our users and their rights			0
" the ruling also dismayed online privacy advocates			0
" the court continued to fail to grapple with one of the key issues underlying this case : do individuals give up their ability to go to court to try to protect their free speech and privacy rights when they use the @entity89 ? as we explained in our friend - of - the - court brief last month , the answer has to be no , " @entity90 , a staff attorney for the @entity91 , wrote in a blog post			0
fine later added : " the government should n't be able to get this sensitive and constitutionally protected information without a warrant and without first satisfying @entity100 scrutiny			0
" in his ruling , @entity18 speculated that the founding fathers would have quite enjoyed expressing themselves on today 's social networks			0
but while freedom of speech applies to @entity11 , " that is not the same as arguing that those public tweets are protected			1
" " there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in a tweet sent around the world , " wrote the judge , who went on to compare information posted on a public network to an eyewitness 's account of a crime on the street			2
in a smart bit of timing , @entity11 on monday released its first @entity121 , detailing requests from governments around the world to get user information or suppress tweets during the first half of 2012			1
there have been 849 requests for information so far this year ( for 1,181 individual @entity11 accounts ) -- more than during all of 2011 , the report said			1
the @entity29 leads the charge , with 679 requests for information , and @entity11 says it provided at least some of the requested data 75 % of the time			1
@entity138 comes in second place with 98 information requests , and the @entity141 and @entity142 tied for third with 11 requests each			1
@entity11 is still banned in a number of countries , including @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
when @entity11 receives one of these requests , it automatically informs the user before taking any steps , unless prohibited by law , which is what it did with @entity17			1
however , this is more of an admirable courtesy than a set - in - stone policy , since all users have already been informed that @entity11 reserves the right to " access , read , preserve , and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to ( i ) satisfy any applicable law , regulation , legal process or governmental request			2
" a key issue in the @entity17 case that could affect similar subpoenas is determining who really owns a tweet			0
@entity17 originally filed a motion to quash the @entity174 's subpoena himself , but judge @entity18 dismissed it in april because he said @entity17 did n't own the information being requested -- @entity11 did			1
according to @entity11 's terms of service , the user gives @entity11 a " worldwide , nonexclusive , royalty - free license " to distribute tweets in any medium , even those that do n't exist yet			1
in may , @entity11 added a line to its terms of service clarifying that users retain their rights to their content .			0

a @entity19 judge rules that tweets are public information
judge orders @entity11 to turn over deleted tweets of @entity37 *protester*
@entity11 also releases its " @entity121 " of governments ' requests for info
the @entity29 makes the most requests for user information , followed by @entity138
