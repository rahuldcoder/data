-- the jury may still be out for many @entity3 fans over the future of coach @entity5 but few can argue about the @entity6 leading the @entity7 to the @entity9 knockout stages for a 15th consecutive year			1
he achieved his latest qualification after goals from @entity13 , his first for the club at the 19th attempt , and @entity16 secured a 2 - 0 home win over @entity18			2
@entity18 's compatriots @entity19 and @entity22 @entity21 also made it through to the last 16 on wednesday			1
" it 's not easy to be consistent so i am very proud of that , " @entity5 said after the game			0
" the club deserves a lot of credit			0
" the problem in many @entity3 supporters ' eyes is that the fine record merely papers over cracks that may well be exposed when the last 16 kicks off in february			1
the @entity36 , who have never won the competition but who finished runners - up in 2006 , have failed to reach the quarterfinals in each of the last four seasons -- losing to @entity43 ( twice ) , @entity44 and @entity45			0
compounding this frustration is the fact that the side has seldom impressed in the @entity49 , with @entity5 last finishing in the top two in 2005			0
on tuesday , he may have been conscious that he was taking on the man often touted as a leading contender to replace him at the @entity55 -- @entity18 coach @entity56			0
victory against a side that had already secured qualification came at a familiar cost though , with both @entity61 and midfielder @entity62 going off with injuries			0
little surprise then that @entity5 was hoping for some positives , following a season in which key players like @entity68 , @entity69 and goalkeeper @entity70 have all been forced onto the sidelines			0
" from now until february we must improve as a team , get encouragement from this win and hopefully have more players back , " @entity5 added			0
in @entity79 's other game , @entity77 won their first match of the campaign when beating ten - man @entity82 2 - 0 , with @entity83 netting both goals			0
having ended @entity18 's 100 % record , @entity3 have an outside chance of now finishing top of the group -- providing they win in @entity82 , and @entity18 trip up at home to @entity77 -- and so avoiding the heavyweights in the next round			1
@entity93 that was precisely what @entity19 were hoping to do but they capped off a record week for @entity97 sides -- albeit for the wrong reasons			2
they lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity101 which , in addition to @entity18 's defeat and those of both @entity43 and @entity105 on tuesday , meant @entity97 's four @entity9 entrants all lost in the same week for the first time ever			1
@entity101 scored with their only effort on target , just as they did when hosting @entity19 in september , and @entity113 is still wide open -- with three sides capable of going through			0
@entity19 still managed to ensure progress on wednesday but their nine points are now only one better than @entity101 's , while @entity117 -- who beat @entity119 1 - 0 -- have moved onto seven			1
meanwhile , last season 's beaten finalists @entity21 created their own slice of history when progressing from the group stage in consecutive years for the first time ever			2
a @entity126 hat - trick helped them to a 4 - 0 victory over @entity129 and the @entity22 will qualify top of @entity131 unless they lose heavily in @entity132 next month			0
the @entity133 need a draw to progress after winning 2 - 0 in @entity135 against @entity136 , with @entity137 and @entity138 earning @entity132 's first away win in the group stage for two years			2
perfect start defending champions @entity140 are still the only side in the competition with a 100 % record after @entity145 's goal in @entity146 was enough to a earn a 1 - 0 win over @entity148			1
the victory was the fifteenth in a row for @entity153 's side , so equaling @entity140 's best runs , achieved in the 1960 - 61 season under @entity156 and three seasons ago under @entity158			2
victory away to @entity160 in @entity161 on saturday will create a new record			0
in @entity165 's other game , @entity163 stopped a run of four consecutive defeats but still had to settle for a 2 - 2 draw away to @entity169			1
the @entity170 scored late to deny the five - time champions all three points , but the equalizer changed little -- with @entity163 still needing to beat @entity148 at @entity174 next month to go through			1
ludogorets are the only side that @entity163 have scored against in the group , whereas @entity145 , who has now netted in his last 12 away @entity9 games , has struck against every team			1
in a statistic @entity3 fans may want to shy away from , the @entity179 has scored 43 @entity9 goals since the start of the 2011 - 12 season -- precisely the same tally as that boasted by @entity5 's @entity3 in the same period .			1

@entity3 , @entity21 and @entity19 all qualify for last 16 on wednesday
@entity140 maintain 100 % record and equal club record winning run
@entity145 's 71st @entity9 goal moves him *joint* second on all - time scoring list
five - time champions @entity163 held by @entity170 @entity169
