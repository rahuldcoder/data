nationwide , @entity8 won 54 % of the @entity11 vote in 2008 and 26 % of the evangelical vote , according to the @entity208			1

a battleground state , @entity1 with its six electoral votes may be key in the presidential election
one in three @entity10 call themselves @entity123 or evangelicals

president @entity8 , who won @entity1 in 2008 , may have a tough time doing it again
