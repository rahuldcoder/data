@entity0 -- president @entity3 's point person for @entity5 implementation faced her critics on @entity7 on wednesday , testifying under oath before the @entity9			0
here 's what we learned from @entity12 secretary @entity14 ' 3Â½ - hour hearing : highlights from @entity14 in the hot seat analysis : @entity14 ' difficult day 1			1
the buck stops with @entity14 republicans repeatedly pushed the secretary to name names as to who was at fault for recent service outages with the government 's online insurance exchange , who made key decisions to delay window - shopping features or who chose to present vague price quotes once that feature was eventually deployed			1
@entity14 deferred to the software contractor now responsible for overseeing website repairs , @entity35 , and to officials at the @entity37			1
but when asked specifically by @entity39 rep. @entity39 who was responsible for the @entity41 " debacle , " the secretary took responsibility			1
" hold me accountable for the debacle , " @entity14 said			1
" perhaps in an attempt to defray this line of questioning , @entity14 took a cue from @entity37 administrator @entity48 's testimony before the @entity49 on tuesday and apologized for problems with the rollout in her opening statement			1
" in these early weeks , access to healthcare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many @entity59 , including many who have waited years , in some cases their entire lives for the security of health insurance , " @entity14 said in remarks not included in her prepared testimony released earlier in the week			2
" i am as frustrated and angry as anyone with the flawed launch of healthcare.gov			0
so let me say directly to these @entity59 , you deserve better			0
i 'm accountable to you for fixing these problems			0
@entity14 tallies up healthcare.gov cost for weeks , independent analysts have pored over contracts issued by @entity12 in an attempt to determine how much the government spent to develop the failing website			1
conservative critics of the new health care law have cited estimates ranging all the way up to $ 600 million , but on wednesday @entity14 gave @entity80 a figure			1
" we have spent about $ 118 million on the website itself and about $ 56 million has been expended on other it to support the web , " the secretary said			1
@entity14 also revealed that there are outstanding obligations to the agency 's primary contractors , @entity91 and @entity35 , and that money will compensate those companies for their assistance in repairing the website			1
what happens if either contractor fails to fulfill the terms of its contract ? " there is n't a built - in penalty , " @entity14 said in response to questions about the contracts ' language			1
" but i can tell you that paying for work that is n't complete is not something that we will do			2
even @entity12 is n't sure how many people have enrolled echoing @entity48 's testimony , @entity14 said that the rocky rollout of @entity41 will likely result in low enrollment numbers when the administration issues its first data release in mid-november			1
" our projections prior to launch were always that there would be a very small number at the beginning , " @entity14 said			2
" we watched the @entity123 trend , which started slowly and then built			0
i think there is no question that given our flawed launch of healthcare.gov it will be a very small number			0
" but @entity14 was pushed by many republicans as to why she could n't provide any data now			1
members asked about call center data , paper applications and attempted enrollments that were thwarted by technical glitches			0
no matter the context , @entity14 ' answer was the same , " we do not have any reliable data			1
" when pushed by @entity127 rep. @entity127 of @entity137 to authorize insurance companies to release data from their end , @entity14 said that all of the data that exists was unusable because " the system is n't functioning			1
" " according to the insurance companies who are eager to have customers , they are not getting reliable data all the way through the system , " she said			1
" it 's one of the real problems that we have			0
it depends what you mean by ' crash ' at one point on wednesday , @entity14 raised the ire of @entity127 by pushing back against their use of the word " crash " when talking about the problems with healthcare.gov			1
" i would suggest the website has never crashed , " the secretary said			2
" it is functional , but at a very slow speed and very low reliability , and has continued to function			0
" @entity171 : when is a crash not a crash ? @entity174 warned by contractor a month before launch as many members noted , at the time of those remarks , visitors to the application portion of @entity41 were unable to create an account and instead were faced with an error message			0
" the system is down at the moment , " the message read			0
" we are experiencing technical difficulties and hope to have them resolved soon			0
" many might consider limited or no functionality as a " crash , " but when asked for clarification , @entity12 spokeswoman @entity192 stuck by the secretary 's assertion that the website has never crashed			1
" as the secretary says , the site works , " @entity192 said			0
" but it is slow and has a lot of user errors			0
but even on the first day , some people could get all the way through the system			0
so it did not crash			0
if it crashed , it would have been totally down			0
" while the application portion may have been totally down during @entity14 ' testimony , visitors were still able to access the healthcare.gov homepage , learn about the law and browse plans through the site 's window - shopping feature			2
meaning the site was n't totally down			0
@entity14 wo n't get an @entity5 card because of an amendment added to the health care law , members of @entity80 and their staff must enter the insurance exchange intended for those without employer - provided coverage			1
earlier this year , the @entity224 issued a rule that allows those federal employees entering the exchange to keep the contribution that the federal government currently provides to help cover the costs of insurance			0
@entity127 rep. @entity232 of @entity233 asked the secretary whether she would join members of @entity80 and their staff in purchasing insurance on the federal insurance exchange , even though the law did not require her to			1
after consulting with @entity240 director @entity239 , who was seated behind her , @entity14 responded that it would be " illegal " for her to join the exchange because she receives insurance through the @entity243			2
" if i have affordable coverage in my workplace , i 'm not eligible to go into the marketplace , that 's part of the law , " @entity14 said			2
is it really ' illegal ' for @entity14 to have @entity5 ? later , in a somewhat heated exchange with @entity250 rep. @entity250 of @entity251 , @entity14 repeated that explanation , telling the committee , " i do n't want to give misinformation to the @entity59 public			1
" " i think it 's illegal for me to access the marketplace , " she said , before adding , " i would gladly join the exchange if i did n't have affordable coverage in my workplace			0
i would gladly join it			0
" later , @entity192 confirmed that it was in fact illegal for @entity14 to join the exchange , but not for the reason she stated			2
" marketplace plans can not be sold to a @entity264 enrollee , and the secretary is a @entity264 enrollee , " @entity192 said			0
if @entity14 , who turned 65 in may , did not have supplemental insurance through @entity264 , she would have the option of foregoing her employer - sponsored plan through the @entity243 and purchasing insurance on the exchange but because she had affordable insurance available to her , she would be ineligible for federal subsidies regardless of her income , and because the law did not require her to move onto the exchange , the @entity224 rule would not apply to her -- as it does to members of @entity80			2
more : ' whatever , ' a frustrated @entity14 says			2

@entity14 would n't name names on who was responsible for website woes
@entity12 secretary says about $ 174 million has been spent on website
@entity14 maintains @entity12 does n't have enough ' reliable data ' to say how many have enrolled
*definition* of website ' crash ' differs between @entity14 , @entity127
