-- a few dozen protesters picketed the restaurants of acclaimed chef @entity3 last weekend , over his use of an ingredient that has become a lightning rod in the culinary world -- foie gras			0
chefs like @entity10 sing its praises , calling foie gras " one of the 10 most important flavors in gastronomy			0
" " it 's one of the best foods in the world for a couple of reasons , and i think it 's because it has this very unique trait which is that it is on one side , extremely rich , but on the other , extremely delicate , " @entity27 , the ceo and founder of @entity29 , a gourmet food company that started 25 years ago supplying @entity31 with foie gras			1
@entity34 for " fat liver , " this delicacy comes from ducks and geese that are fed massive amounts of food in the last weeks of their life			1
foie gras is used in terrines and mousses , and by more adventurous chefs , shaved cold to add a creamy fat element to restaurant dishes			0
the force - feeding process , called gavage , causes the animals liver to expand up to 10 times its size			1
anti-foie gras activists call the process cruel			1
producers insist it does n't hurt the fowl			2
" we are the easiest target in the world for a couple of reasons , one our accent , it 's called foie gras , it 's a @entity34 word , " @entity27 tells @entity0			1
" two it 's an organ			2
it 's easy to say that we do n't need a meat organ to survive or to live			2
three , it 's expensive , so it 's ' elitist , ' and four , it 's so easy for somebody just to take a look at the photo of the funnel inside the esophagus and to say ' @entity78 , if it were me , it would hurt			1
' well , you are not a duck , so it is not you , you know ? but it 's so easy to empathize with the duck			1
" foie gras has been produced by farmers since the days of ancient @entity87 , when farmers discovered that the waterfowl 's liver expanded in the days leading up to the bird 's planned migration			1
the liver , in the center of the bird 's body , stores fat the bird traditionally uses on long migratory flights			1
only three farms in the @entity31 produce foie gras			0
@entity102 gets its foie gras from @entity104 , two hours north of @entity105 , which produces about 375,000 pounds of the delicacy a year			2
each foie gras sells for between $ 70 to $ 100 per lobe			0
at @entity110 , ducks are raised to 12 weeks before they begin the gavage process in pens 4 - feet by 6 - feet with 11 ducks in each enclosure , according to @entity115 , the farm 's operations manager			1
over 21 days the ducks are fed three times a day by a worker who uses a tube to fill the bird 's esophagus with grain			1
at the beginning , each bird gets about 3 ounces of food , which increases to 10 ounces by the end of the program , @entity115 said , noting that the esophagus can hold up to a liter of volume			1
each duck will yield a liver that weighs about 1.5 pounds			1
the rest of the bird is processed for its meat , remaining organs , bones and feathers			2
it 's this feeding process that anti-foie gras protesters target with photos of the feeding tubes and banners that read " how much cruelty can you swallow ? " " the idea that you can produce the products that we produce -- that are a delicacy -- by mistreating animals is just completely , it 's inconceivable , " @entity115 says			1
" it 's not how farming is done			2
" veterinarians say the bird lacks a gag reflex and their esophagus is lined with collagen , which makes it insensitive to pain			1
the bird breathes through a hole on the tongue			2
still , protesters call the process a travesty			2
" the whole point of the production method is to create this diseased liver , which is unlike any other form of animal agriculture where you 're not just growing animals to be eating , but you 're also torturing the animal to grossly enlarge its organs for consumption , " @entity168 , an attorney and chairman of the board of the @entity170 , said			1
foie gras producers argue against use of the word " diseased			0
" " when we force - feed ducks and geese and we stop the force - feeding , the liver recesses to normal , " @entity27 says			1
" so we do not induce a sickness , we just use the natural propensity to expand the liver			2
" those opposing the production of foie gras have succeeded in getting @entity195 to adopt a law that will make it illegal to serve or produce in 2012			0
a ban on the ingredient in @entity200 , adopted in 2006 , was overturned by the @entity201 22 months later			0
" the key will be both banning the sale and getting restaurants to just remove it voluntarily and not sell it , " @entity168 said			0
" they 'll always be able to find a place to produce that is going to make it be legal			0
they 'll just go to a country with no laws , like @entity212			0
the key is either for consumers to stop eating it or for restaurants to stop selling it			0
" @entity168 says his group has hired staff in @entity105 to begin to target @entity221 restaurants to have them remove foie gras from the menu or face protests			0
but foie gras producers say they 're being targeted by people whose ultimate goal is a meat - free world			2
" there can not be an agreement because for vegetarian activists , no farm is a good farm , " @entity27 says			1
" they do n't want us to eat meat period			0
so eventually , if they were to succeed , once somebody is out of the picture , the next one will be the chicken farm down the road			0
there is no ' good ' farm for activists			0
" still , there may be middle ground			0
chef @entity246 , inspired by the work of a @entity249 foie gras producer , @entity250 , has begun experimenting with " ethical foie gras , " harvested from geese allowed to roam @entity253 in @entity254 , @entity255 , foraging for food , according to their natural feeding cycles			0
@entity27 says that even those without an interest in the delicacy should pay attention to this fight			1
" what they should be interested in is making sure that the farming practices in the world are sound , " she said			0
" that they are not destructive -- to me that 's the most important thing			0

@entity272 is liver from a force - fed duck or goose and is considered a delicacy
animal *rights* groups call *pouring* grain down tube in fowl 's esophagus is cruel
veterinarians : bird lacks gag reflex , esophagus is insensitive to pain
@entity27 : complaints are ploy by activists to turn everyone into vegetarians
