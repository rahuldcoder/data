-- @entity2 @entity1 , 31 , the host of " @entity4 , " an online video show , has been known to lick rocks , suck leather and eat dirt while on camera , all to illustrate the unique properties of wine			1
" @entity4 " host @entity1 discusses four spooky wine varieties for @entity14 show			1
of a " wild and gamey " red from @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity1 says , " hit a deer on the road			0
throw a bunch of cherries on it			0
take out your knife , cut the deer			0
that 's the flavor profile			0
" that kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers			1
across the @entity35 , budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of web sites , blogs , bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand			1
about 40,000 internet viewers -- many of them 20 - somethings -- have a daily appointment with " @entity4			1
" the low - budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three - level wine retail operation that @entity1 's family owns in @entity51 , @entity52			1
@entity1 has a discerning nose and palate , and he does n't dumb down his subject			0
yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop - culture references -- and the kind of language a @entity62 critic would be unlikely to employ			0
the mission of wine sites like " @entity4 , " say several of the people behind these new outlets , is to demystify wine ( and in some cases , sell it , too )			1
using the language , attitude and new media that appeal to a young , tech - savvy generation , they advocate trusting one 's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics			1
some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions			1
one site , @entity82 , declares its dedication to " exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation , " with reviews , online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking -- all with attitude			1
" the ( wine ) establishment is about ratings and ' reputation , ' " says the site 's founder , @entity93 , 29			1
" it 's about collecting the ' good ' stuff as defined by someone else 's palate and tastes			0
that bores a younger generation			0
" " we 're not afraid to be smartasses , " he continues			0
" we make fun of ourselves , old - world wine makers , new - world wine makers , and anyone else we can get our hands on			2
" in the @entity116 , interest in wine is exploding			1
while consumption has leveled out in traditional wine - producing countries such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity17 , especially among young people , it has trended upwards in the @entity116 for 15 straight years			1
the @entity116 is projected to overtake no. 2 @entity122 by the end of 2007 , according to the annual report @entity127 : @entity128 a leading industry trade publication			1
many of the new converts to wine are the so - called @entity133 , the under - 30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they 're also called @entity137 , or the internet generation			1
one of the wine web sites targeting a younger demographic is @entity141 , which features a blog called " @entity143			2
" " we love wine but hate the elitism , " writes founder , @entity144			2
" after all , it 's just grape juice			0
" with rants about wine tasting fees , a feature spotlighting " wine hotties " working at @entity155 wineries , as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries , @entity141 leaves little doubt about its target audience			2
@entity161 , an online wine community , appeals to more established wine collectors			2
the site provides free software -- designed by @entity161 , a fortuitously named former @entity167 software developer -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines			2
the 39,000 users ( who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars ) post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via @entity178 and cell phones			0
community tasting notes shed light on how cellar - worthy wines are evolving , helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle			0
@entity185 , another online community of wine fans , already had 40,000 users when @entity1 purchased the site last year			1
the free service allows users to catalog and review wines			0
instead of having " friends " as on @entity195 , members identify " drinking buddies " and check out what they 're drinking			0
in the growing presence of wine fans on the @entity35 -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- @entity1 sees a movement			2
" they 're part of forums , they meet up ( offline ) , " he says			0
" it 's about bringing people together			0
it 's all that 's right about wine			2
the 300 - plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans , who call themselves " @entity220 , " share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site 's forum			1
on a recent rainy afternoon , @entity1 barreled , unrehearsed and unscripted , through a 20 - minute show in a single take			2
he wrapped up @entity4 episode no. 337 with what has become his signature line			1
" you , with a little bit of me , we 're changing the wine world , are n't we ? " e-mail to a friend @entity233 provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to web publishers			0
@entity236 is a freelance writer based in @entity237 , @entity238 and the author of more than a dozen travel guides .			0

" @entity4 " internet show has about 40,000 *regular* viewers
show takes irreverent look at wine business
