@entity0 , @entity1 -- the " terrible " weekend killings of civilians wo n't knock the @entity6 and its @entity8 allies off the course they 've charted in @entity1 , defense secretary @entity3 said monday			1
an @entity6 sergeant is suspected of killing 16 people : nine @entity1 children , three women and four men in two villages near his combat outpost on sunday			1
gen. @entity18 , the @entity6 and @entity8 commander in @entity1 , called the rampage " the actions of a single soldier , " but it has added new strains to the relationship between the coalition and the @entity1 people in the decade - old war			1
as he set out for a trip to the @entity28 , @entity3 told reporters the allies " seem to get tested almost every other day			2
" but he added , " it is important that , all of us , @entity6 , @entity1 , the @entity34 forces all stick to the strategy that we 've laid out			1
" " @entity36 , " he said			2
" these kind of events and incidents are going to take place			0
they 've taken place in any war			0
this is not the first of those events , and they probably wo n't be the last			1
" sunday 's killings followed a string of incidents involving @entity6 troops that have strained ties between the @entity6 and @entity1 , and @entity1 president @entity54 condemned the weekend bloodshed as " unforgivable			1
" @entity1 's parliament demanded a public trial for the suspect , while the @entity1 @entity59 condemned @entity6 troops as " sick - minded @entity6 savages " and vowed to exact revenge			1
" this is a very negative act in relations between the @entity1 and the @entity6 , " said a tribal elder in the district of @entity64 , where the killings took place			1
" all @entity1 have been hurt by this act and i do n't think people will trust the @entity6 anymore , " said the official , who asked not to be named out of fears for his safety			1
but @entity18 told @entity2 's " @entity75 " that the decade - old allied campaign in @entity1 " remains on track " despite the violence			1
" every single day , @entity1 soldiers and @entity1 police and @entity34 troops are serving shoulder - to - shoulder in some very difficult situations , " he said			2
" and our engagement with them , our shoulder - to - shoulder relationship with them , our conduct of operations with them every single day defines the real relationship			0
this is an isolated act			0
" the still - unidentified suspect served three tours of duty in @entity95 before being deployed to @entity1 , @entity18 said			1
a @entity6 military official , who asked not to be named because he was talking about an ongoing investigation , said the suspect is an @entity98 staff sergeant who arrived in @entity1 in january			1
" the evidence at this point , both in terms of observations and reports and interviews , leads us to believe that he acted as an individual at this point , " @entity18 said			0
during the suspect 's last deployment , in 2010 , he was riding in a vehicle that rolled over in a wreck , according to a senior @entity114 official who also spoke on condition of anonymity			1
the sergeant was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury after the wreck , but was found fit for duty after treatment , the official said			1
@entity18 said the suspect 's medical history would be part of the investigation , which would be handled by @entity6 military authorities			1
" we will certainly keep the @entity1 government informed throughout this investigation , " he said			1
" we will keep the @entity1 government informed throughout the process of adjudicating the outcome			2
but this individual will be investigated and the outcome will be in accordance with @entity6 law			0
" @entity135 response to shooting spree the suspect is in his mid- 30s , with a wife and children , officials said monday			0
the senior defense official said he is an infantry sniper trained to fire fatal shots from up to 800 meters ( yards ) away , and was assigned to an outpost near the southern @entity1 city of @entity145 to support a @entity147 unit , according to a second military official who asked not to be named because of the investigation			1
after the predawn shootings sunday , @entity3 said the suspect " basically turned himself in and told individuals what had happened			1
" but the senior defense official said the suspect has invoked his right to remain silent and has given no indication of his motive			2
a congressional source not authorized to speak publicly identified his unit as the 3rd @entity160 , 2nd @entity161 , stationed at @entity162 near @entity163 , @entity164			0
the source said the soldier was put in pretrial confinement in the southern @entity1 city of @entity145 , about 25 kilometers ( 15 miles ) from the outpost where he was stationed , while the senior defense official said the suspect 's family has been moved on to @entity162 for their safety			1
@entity18 said an @entity1 soldier at the outpost spotted the suspect going out around 3 a.m. sunday and notified @entity6 commanders			1
" a search party was being put together immediately , " he said			0
" there was a head count done amongst the @entity6 soldiers , recognized that he was missing , unaccounted for			0
we put together a search party right away and it was as that search party was forming that we began to have indications of the outcome of his departure			0
" the killings could intensify the rage that sparked deadly riots directed at international forces last month over the burning of qurans by @entity6 troops			0
in addition , @entity6 commanders were forced to condemn a video of a squad of @entity200 urinating on bodies in january , and several soldiers -- also from @entity162 -- were charged with taking part in a rogue " kill squad , " with the highest - ranking soldier being sentenced to life in prison in november			0
@entity59 link attack to @entity210 burning the latest incident brought a new round of high - level statements from @entity164			0
" this is not who we are , and the @entity6 is committed to seeing that those responsible are held accountable , " @entity6 secretary of state @entity214 said monday			0
on sunday , president @entity219 phoned @entity54 to offer his condolences , assuring his @entity1 counterpart that justice would be done			2
according to the @entity135 , @entity219 said the attack " does not represent the exceptional character of our military and the respect that the @entity6 has for the people of @entity1			2
" but villager @entity228 said many of his neighbors have lost confidence in both the @entity6 and the @entity1 security forces , whom they accuse of failing to protect them , he said			2
" the people in these villages are scared , and we do n't know what is going to happen next , " @entity228 said			1
" they saw nothing except the @entity6 going and killing them in their homes , " he added			0
@entity145 and the surrounding region is the home of the @entity59 , and eight of the 69 coalition troops killed in @entity1 so far this year died in the province			2
officials within the @entity219 administration said the incident will not derail talks on the role of @entity6 troops beyond 2014 , when foreign combat troops are scheduled to withdraw			0
the @entity6 and its allies invaded @entity1 in 2001 , after @entity255 's attacks on @entity256 and @entity164 that killed nearly 3,000 people			2
the invasion quickly toppled the @entity59 , an @entity259 fundamentalist movement that ruled most of @entity1 and had allowed @entity255 to operate from its territory			2
but the militia soon regrouped and launched an insurgent campaign against the allied forces and a new government led by @entity54			0
the no. 1 @entity6 target in the conflict , @entity255 founder @entity268 , was killed in a commando raid in neighboring @entity270 in may 2011			0
@entity6 and allied combat troops are scheduled to leave @entity1 by 2014 , and @entity54 has been increasingly critical of the allied force			0
tensions ramped up dramatically in february after a group of @entity6 soldiers burned copies of the @entity210 , @entity259 's holy book , that had been seized from inmates at the @entity6 - run prison at @entity279 because they allegedly contained extremist communications			0
@entity2 's @entity289 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 and journalist @entity288 contributed to this report .			0
