-- as @entity3 's super rich grow ever richer they need new toys to play with			1
now , some are betting that superyachts will be the next big thing for those @entity3 millionaires wanting to show off their bling			1
" there 's no question that @entity3 have the appetite and the deep pockets for a thriving yacht culture , " says @entity10 , @entity3 ceo for upmarket yacht firm @entity11 -- which was one of the first to enter the then almost non-existent market back in 2003			1
now the company says it is about secure a deal worth up to $ 33 million , selling five yachts to a mainland @entity3 customer			2
and with recent figures showing that @entity26 's economic giant has over 875,000 millionaires there could plenty more orders to come			1
there 's certainly ample room for growth			2
according to figures cited by state media , there are about 1,300 private yachts in @entity3			2
this compares to 17 million privately owned recreational boats in the @entity38 , the world 's biggest yacht market , according to industry publication @entity41			2
but where some see @entity3 as a yacht - seller 's paradise , others are more cautious			1
" in 2010 @entity3 only imported about 100 yachts -- that 's not a lot when you consider the country 's wealth and population , " says @entity47 , @entity48 ceo of @entity49 , a @entity50 brokerage firm tailored to the growing @entity26 market			1
while @entity47 stresses that demand has certainly increased from next to nothing only two years ago , he believes that the @entity3 market is still strangled in a net of prohibitions			0
he argues that modern yachts need modern marinas , with properly trained staff -- " but who wants to invest millions in a high - tech marina , " he asks , " only to find out that you have to rebuild the whole thing because of an obscure regulation ? " a 42 % tax on imports of foreign yachts is also proving prohibitive , he says			0
" ok , so a rich guy is a rich guy , but if he wants to buy a $ 5 million toy and he 's facing the prospect of paying another $ 2 million in tax ... he 's going to think twice ! " dr. @entity78 is an assistant economics professor at the @entity79			0
she says trailblazing @entity3 trend setters will need to take up yachting before it really takes off			1
" how do you jump - start a hobby ? " she asks			0
" it 's like @entity86 wine in @entity3 -- in the beginning no one drank it , then a very few people started drinking a particular @entity92 brand , now finally there is a big market			1
it 's a herd mentality			0
@entity78 adds that there are cultural barriers that may delay the yachting revolution			0
" while some of @entity3 's rich are happy to spend their money on lavish things , others have a more traditional view about ostentatious displays of wealth , " she says			1
" ' big trees attract more wind ' is the old saying , and the @entity112 view that the more conspicuous you are the more risks you put yourself into still acts as a sort of restraint for many			0
" she adds : " unlike @entity117 -- another emerging market for yachts -- @entity3 people do n't like beaches much , they do n't like the sun and they 're not interested in getting a tan			0
" but @entity10 is fully undeterred			0
" sure , @entity3 will use the boat differently to their counterparts in the @entity126 , " he says			2
" in my dealings there is a greater emphasis on the safety and stability , and our customers prefer a hard - top roof to shield them from the sun. karaoke rooms are also very popular -- this is all just a matter of different tastes			1
" according to the @entity11 ceo , the @entity3 market will eventually be bigger than the whole @entity86 market put together			2
" you can not expect this in five years -- there are still these problems with infrastructure and so on , " he says			0
" but once these issues are solved -- which they will be -- then the floodgates will open			0
