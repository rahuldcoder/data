the risk of operating in a hostile environment is there constantly , " the chairman of the @entity20 said			1
" you 're not going to wait until they 're climbing over the wall , " @entity9 said			2
" had [ @entity3 forces ] overrun the @entity4 unit , it was a straight shot to the @entity8 airport			1
so , we 're not going to let that happen			0
" @entity5 's @entity32 reported october 7 the @entity2 had used the @entity18 helicopters to push back @entity3 forces advancing near @entity34			1
the aircraft can carry out precise airstrikes but do so at a lower altitude , risking a possible strike by surface - to - air missiles @entity3 is known to possess			2
at the time , @entity32 reported the @entity2 did not predict @entity3 making a direct run for @entity8			1
however , there had been general concern that @entity3 elements are in the city and around the airport and have been in mortar range for months			1
@entity9 's comments sunday clarified for the first time that the @entity18 was used to protect the @entity8 airport from such an overt threat			1
the comments came in a wide - ranging interview with @entity15 " s @entity53 about @entity2 efforts to destroy @entity3			1

in sunday 's interview , @entity9 conceded that having @entity2 troops on the ground , in theory , would help @entity4 forces spot @entity3 targets			1
but he still insisted the @entity2 is not at that point			1
" yeah , there will be circumstances when the answer to that question will likely be yes			0
but i have n't encountered one right now , " @entity9 said			2
" i 'd actually use the example of you know @entity84 will likely be the decisive battle in the ground campaign at some point in the future , " @entity9 said			2
" when they are ready to go back on the offensive , my instinct at this point is that that will require a different kind of advising and assisting because of the complexity of that fight			0
" meanwhile , coalition partners continue to look to the @entity2 for more military might			2
@entity62 has long resisted calls for a no - fly zone over @entity99			0
however , @entity101 leaders have repeatedly pressed for one			0
" we want to have a no - fly zone			0
we want to have a safe haven on our border , " @entity101 prime minister @entity103 told @entity5 's @entity104 in an interview that aired october 6			0

" @entity9 said that while a no - fly zone is not in the works at this point , it ca n't be ruled out			0
coalition airstrikes continued over the weekend in @entity99 and @entity4			0
by some assessments , @entity3 appeared poised for a victory in the disputed city of @entity119 along the @entity101 - @entity99 border			0
world leaders have repeatedly warned that should isis take the city , residents there could be massacred			0
" whether there are still 5,000 people there or not is , is a matter of conjecture , " @entity9 said			0
" but i have no doubt that @entity3 will conduct the same kind of horrific atrocities if they have the opportunity to do so			0
