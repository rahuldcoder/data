@entity2 was also an accomplished writer , said @entity18 , who cited her autobiography and said she was working on a sitcom to have been called " @entity42 " at the time of her death			1
it was " about the time in her life when she rode a bus , when she was out of the business for a little while , " he said			2
" she met a lot of people , some of whom were very funny			2
" though her songs were widely popular , @entity2 made her living neither through her writing nor through her nearly 400 recordings , but through live performances , @entity18 said			1
" she got ripped off , " he said about the recordings			2
still , the lack of payoff " never soured her on the business , " he said			2
" she once quoted to me a line from the movie , ' @entity63			2
' one of the characters says , ' at least you get applause			0
' that was always her			0
" @entity2 herself cited the problem in a 2009 interview for the @entity16 and @entity72 for @entity73			1
" i have never made any money making records , and i 've made a bunch of them , " she said			0
but , she added , she always had a response when people would ask her why she continued to sing			0
" i said because it was my way of getting music out of me onto the public			0
other than that , i would n't have anything			0
if i had stopped and said , ' well , no , they 're not paying me			0
i 'm not going to do any â€” ' i could n't do that			0
i could n't throw away what gift i had because of the money			0
so @entity89 gave me another way			1
i worked for @entity91 , i did temp work , anything i could do			0
" @entity2 last performed on august 27 at @entity94 in @entity11 , said @entity95 , who produced the show and knew her for 40 years			1
" she was really a giant of @entity99 jazz singing , but she never really got the recognition she so richly deserved , and lived the last 20 or 30 years of her life in relative obscurity , " he said			1
" it 's a brutal business and @entity2 was a victim of that brutality , for sure			1
but she was one of our greatest singers , she was a true angel , no doubt about it			0
" " @entity2 was one of the great female jazz vocalists & lyricists of our time , " said blues legend @entity109			1
" she left the world with her beautiful music and will be missed by all the people whose lives she touched			0
