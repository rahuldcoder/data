for the first time , someone in the @entity2 administration apologized for the problem - plagued @entity5 website			1
@entity6 also said on tuesday that the online troubles were being resolved and the overall program was working , albeit slower and less successfully than hoped			1
in the first congressional testimony from a government official on the botched launch of @entity12 , the head of the federal @entity14 told the @entity15 that the " vast majority " of consumers would be able to successfully use the site by the end of november			2
" i want to apologize to you that the website does not work as well as it should , " she said , adding that @entity12 " can and will be fixed			1
" the hearing served as a hot seat for @entity6 , whose agency has been blamed for the website troubles causing a political headache for president @entity2 and his signature health care reforms , as well as a venting session for @entity31 after their failed efforts to scuttle the reforms			1
@entity6 reports to health secretary @entity34 , who has come under fire for the problems that plagued the introduction of the enrollment website			1
some congressional republicans demand her resignation or firing , and @entity34 will face a hearing by the @entity42 on wednesday			1
she is expected to tell that committee the initial experience of @entity12 has been frustrating for many , and unacceptable			1
but she will also defend @entity5 , according to prepared remarks			2
" the fact is that the @entity5 delivered on its product : quality , affordable health insurance			1
the tremendous interest shown in @entity12 shows that people want to buy this product			2
we know the initial consumer experience at @entity12 has not been adequate			1
we will address these initial and any ongoing problems , and build a website that fully delivers on this promise of the @entity5 , " @entity34 is expected to say			1
the health secretary will provide figures for the site , which has had more than 20 million unique visits to date			2
over the past few weeks , nearly 700,000 applications have been submitted			0
people are also signing up through a call center , paper applications and in - person assistance			0
" by enlisting additional technical help , aggressively monitoring errors , testing to prevent new issues from cropping up , and regularly deploying fixes to the site , we are working to ensure consumers ' interaction with @entity12 is a positive one , and that the @entity5 fully delivers on its promise , " @entity34 will say			1
in an exclusive interview last week , the health secretary told @entity81 that @entity2 did n't know of the problems with the @entity5 's website until after its troubled launch on october 1			1
this was despite the fact that insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a prelaunch test run			0
policies canceled more trouble for @entity2 came out of the testimony , as @entity6 conceded that some people with individual health coverage -- rather than the group coverage that most @entity97 have -- will be forced to get new policies because of increased requirements under the @entity101			2
" these individuals in a small group , our individual markets , had no protections " before the reforms became law , @entity6 explained			2
until now , such consumers " could be kicked out any time for pre-existing conditions " or realize too late that their policies failed to cover hospitalization or cancer treatments , @entity6 said			2
the reforms protect them by requiring a minimum standard of coverage , she added			0
for some , that means more expensive policies and any change breaks the oft - repeated pledge by @entity2 that " if you like your plan , you can keep your plan " when he was pushing for @entity126 to pass his signature reforms			0
@entity128 rep. @entity128 of @entity129 hammered @entity6 on that point , noting a constituent who got a letter telling her that the health care reforms caused the cancellation of her current plan with a more expensive alternative in its place			1
" she has health insurance that she likes			2
she 's been paying her premium			0
she wants to keep it			0
but she ca n't , " @entity128 said			0
" is n't that a lie ? " @entity6 responded that some insurers changed or discontinued plans that failed to meet the @entity5 requirements , even though present coverage could still be offered in some cases under a " grandfather " provision in the legislation , despite lacking the full benefits of the reforms			0
she advised anyone being forced to get a new policy to examine all options under the new system , including the possibility of getting federal subsidies if they are eligible			0
according to the @entity161 website , 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011 , representing about 5 % of the population			1
the vast majority of @entity97 -- at least two - thirds of the population in 2011 -- had coverage through their employer , @entity168 , @entity169 or other public providers and will not be affected by changes involving individual coverage			0
at the @entity174 , spokesman @entity173 said " a significant portion " of the 5 % of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges			2
" one of the issues that the @entity5 was designed to address was the need to provide greater security to those @entity97 forced to seek insurance on the individual market , " @entity173 said			0
on @entity188 , a top @entity174 @entity187 told reporters on tuesday that his party " should have been more precise " when making the pledge about people keeping coverage they liked			1
" i think preciseness would have been better , " said rep. @entity194 of @entity195			0
he added that the promise was made to try to allay the fears of the majority of @entity97 who get health coverage from their employers or government programs such as @entity168 and @entity169			2
partisan exchanges as expected , tuesday 's hearing included fiery partisan exchanges , with republicans saying the website problems foreshadow deeper problems that threaten higher premiums and government intrusion in future health coverage while @entity212 accused them of trying to kill reforms that benefit millions of @entity97			1
under @entity31 questioning , @entity6 said initial figures on how many people have enrolled so far for health coverage under the reforms wo n't be available until mid-november			1
she noted that the administration has expected the initial enrollment to be small , but noted that the enrollment period ends on march 31			2
when asked by @entity31 about the expected initial low enrollment , @entity6 pointed out that a similar dynamic occurred with implementation of the @entity226 health care law , when people waited until the final deadline approached to sign up			1
to @entity31 rep. @entity230 of @entity231 , the committee chairman , low enrollment signals the failure of the health care reforms , which need young people , and people who are less expensive to insure , to sign up so insurers can offer affordable plans in markets that include older and people who are more expensive to cover			1
" i fear we can see a fundamental breakdown of the insurance market where premiums will skyrocket , pricing millions of @entity97 out of health care , " he said			1
later , @entity246 rep. @entity246 of @entity247 asked @entity6 for a guarantee that consumers will be able to obtain coverage required by the health care law before the deadline			1
" what i can guarantee is that we have a system that is working			0
we are going to improve the speed of that system , " she said			0
" excuse me , " he said			0
" you are saying the system right now is working ? " @entity6 did n't budge , responding : " i am saying it is working			0
it is just not working at the speed that we want and at the success rate that we want			0
" @entity212 rep. @entity263 of @entity264 lambasted @entity31 on the panel for choosing to pile on the website woes in their continuing attempt to dismantle @entity5 instead of working with @entity212 to improve settled law			1
citing the political battle last decade over the @entity272 administration 's @entity168 prescription drug benefit opposed by @entity212 , @entity263 noted " we lost the policy fight " then but chose to help make the program work instead of trying to discredit or undermine it			0
standing up and pointing at his @entity31 colleagues , @entity263 shouted : " how many of you stood up to do that ? none			0
" website problems late tuesday , officials said the data hub behind the @entity5 website was experiencing an outage , prohibiting customers from submitting new applications			1
@entity287 , which provides some technology services behind @entity12 , said federal officials asked the company to provide additional computing and storage ability			2
" at the request of @entity297 's deputy cio , we are now undertaking infrastructure maintenance , which should be complete overnight , " @entity287 spokesman @entity293 said			0
" we anticipate the strengthened infrastructure will help eliminate application downtimes			0
" a key tech malfunction brought down the site sunday			0
in prepared testimony for the hearing , @entity6 said private contractors hired to create the website " have not met expectations			1
" asked about that statement , she cited one of the contractors -- @entity311 , which has a contract worth as much as $ 200 million for its work on the system .			0
