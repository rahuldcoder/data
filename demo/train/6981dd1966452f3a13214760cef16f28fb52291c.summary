-- @entity2 , successor to his father 's dictatorship over @entity5 , will have to find ways to balance political factions and generate revenue -- or he may not remain in power for long , analysts said tuesday			1
shrouded in mystery and believed to be only in his late 20s , @entity2 marks the third generation in his family to officially reign over the so - called @entity14			1
" it 's unprecedented in modern times , " said @entity15 , an expert on the region with the @entity18 's @entity17			1
a popular expression , @entity15 said , summarizes one central reason that third - generation dynasties do n't occur			1
" the first generation makes the wealth ; the second generation manages the wealth ; the third generation squanders the wealth , " he said			0
@entity29 inherited power from his father , a military leader who built a new @entity5 economy			2
@entity29 maintained a fierce grip , partly through building his country 's nuclear arsenal			0
it is unknown whether @entity2 has the skills , knowledge or training to lead his country through the next era			2
@entity5 does not function as a " normal nation state " through imports , exports and taxes , @entity15 said			2
" @entity29 ran a system that was based on competition among senior officials " who controlled economic institutions such as trading companies			0
" the way to view @entity2 is almost as a ceo of @entity5 , " @entity15 said			1
" he either makes money on a recurring basis or he 's out			0
the fact that he 's the youngest son wo n't matter if he ca n't produce the cash			0
" @entity58 , an editor of foreignpolicy.com , said the younger @entity2 's lack of experience does not bode well			1
" i personally put the odds fairly low " that he will succeed in power , he said			0
@entity5 " know much more about the world than they did " when @entity29 came to power , said @entity64 , who last visited a few years ago			2
" they 've watched dvds of @entity71 soap operas			2
people know about @entity73 -- and @entity73 is light years ahead of @entity5			2
" " you can no longer expect people to believe in the @entity2 name the way they used to , " he said			2
the government still deprives its citizens of basic rights and freedoms , and there is little risk of any popular protest against a leader , @entity15 said			0
if something were to end @entity2 's time in power , it would be battling forces within the @entity5 power structure			1
" there are different factions and interest groups , " @entity64 said			1
" i would n't say organized power blocs , but groups that have big business interests now because they 've also been trading with @entity73			0
" " these things begin to get complicated very quickly " for a new leader at the helm , @entity64 said			0
@entity102 of the @entity103 writes that " even with a successor , @entity5 observers have for some time feared a behind - the - scenes power struggle or nuclear instability after @entity29 's death			1
" still , " some experts doubt that @entity2 's death will lead to chaos , " @entity102 writes , noting that the country has shown resilience in the past			1
in the region , analysts and government leaders are looking at early indications in an effort to read the tea leaves			0
" over the span of some 50 hours , @entity5 was very effectively able to conceal the death of @entity29 , successfully make the announcement of his death			0
seeing that it has gone smoothly so far without any bumps , we can relatively carefully speculate that the leadership is relatively well - grounded , " @entity71 intelligence committee chairman @entity127 - se said tuesday in an interview with @entity0			1
" but at the same time , @entity2 is still very young and has only gone through a short period of time for grooming as an heir			0
also , @entity29 died all of a sudden without having been able to fully accelerate the process of the succession			0
depending on the balance between the new people that support @entity2 and the older generation that upheld @entity29 , things may not necessarily go smoothly within the leadership , " he said .			1

@entity2 can be viewed " almost as a ceo of @entity5 , " an analyst says
different factions and interest groups could end the younger @entity2 's reign , an analyst says
@entity71 official : a " relatively well - grounded " government seems to be in place
