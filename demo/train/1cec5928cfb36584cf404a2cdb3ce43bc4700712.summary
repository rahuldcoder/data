" i tried my best in the last lap of qualifying but i made a little mistake in the last chicane on braking and lost a few tenths , " 2010 world champion @entity1 said on the @entity2 website			1
" i was surprised at @entity6 's last lap ; it was fantastic and so fast and @entity7 was also very close to him			1
we have a good position for tomorrow on the front row and we have a good race pace and i 'm confident with the bike so i 'm happy			1

" @entity6 , who has announced he will retire at the end of this season , claimed his third pole position of 2012			1
" this morning was probably one of my biggest crashes , which is saying something ! the crash really knocked the wind out of me , i hurt my head , neck , wrist , knee and shoulder -- it was a bad one for sure , " he said			0
" the team did a really great job , they kept their heads down even when i was n't riding to my full potential or the bike 's full potential and when we were struggling to get the rear tire to work , they did n't give up			0
" then when we came back onto the soft rear tire for the first time since @entity66 , the bike had much more feeling and we were able to put together a fantastic lap and put it on pole			0
as far as race pace goes , we 're still struggling and we need to work on this and make some decisions before the race			0

" we went back to yesterday 's set up with a minor change but only got one lap in , which turned out to be my fastest lap. unfortunately one of the @entity99 bikes got in the way on my qualifying lap. i know they are out there trying to do their thing as well so it 's difficult			2
