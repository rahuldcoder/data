-- the @entity3 @entity2 presidential primary is often a free - for - all , but this year 's contest probably sets a new standard for volatility			2
not surprisingly , @entity3 @entity8 insiders see a close finish in the primary saturday between former @entity11 gov. @entity10 and former house speaker @entity12 , according to a @entity0 survey			1
less than 48 hours before voters would go to the polls , they were buffeted by a sudden announcement from @entity18 gov. @entity17 that he was withdrawing from the @entity2 presidential race and endorsing rival @entity20			2
and as @entity17 was dropping out , the political world was buzzing with reports that @entity20 's second wife , @entity23 , said that her then - husband proposed an " open marriage " before they divorced			2
then , a fiery @entity20 struck back at the opening of the @entity0 debate in @entity29 , attacking the " liberal media " for bringing up the story in the first place			0
" it 's like a darned soap opera , " said one @entity3 @entity8 insider			1
" never seen things this fluid , " echoed another			0
a @entity0 survey of 42 @entity41 insidersâ € ” including @entity2 state legislators , state and local party officials , business and conservative interest group leaders , veterans of previous presidential primary campaigns , @entity8 political consultants , and other party activistsâ € ” found a close race between the top two contenders			1
three @entity3 @entity8 insiders thought the race would end in a dead heat between the two @entity2 contenders			1
the insiders were asked : who do you think will win the @entity3 primary ? @entity10 -- 33 % @entity12 -- 31 % @entity59 -- 19 % @entity60 -- 15 % @entity17 -- @entity61 / a other -- 2 % compared to a similar sounding of @entity8 insiders earlier in the week before @entity17 withdrew , it appeared that @entity20 had gained the most momentum in the closing days of the race			1
before @entity17 dropped out : @entity10 -- 32 % @entity12 -- 25 % @entity59 -- 18 % @entity60 -- 15 % @entity17 -- 8 % other -- 2 % while @entity10 still edged @entity20 slightly in the minds of these insiders , the narrow margin and the ever - changing story lines mean @entity20 could still pull an upset saturday			1
" @entity10 's supporters seem to be firmly behind him at this point , while @entity20 could still gain or lose support depending on how things shake out over the ( final ) days , " said one @entity8 insider			1
" for this reason , i 'm still giving @entity10 the nod at this point			0
" one major uncertainty hanging over the race is the impact of the controversial television interview that @entity20 's second wife , @entity23 , gave to @entity86 's @entity85 in which she said @entity20 had asked her to consider an arrangement that she described as an " open marriage			0
" in the @entity0 @entity3 debate on thursday night , @entity20 denounced the media 's handling of the story and called the accusation " false			1
" " right now , i speculate that people voting for @entity12 may have accounted for his personal baggage in their decision making , without knowing the full extent of it , " said one @entity3 @entity8 insider			2
" however , requests for open marriage do n't play well with value - voters upstate , which seems to be the current heart of the @entity20 surge			0
i think this interview could diminish , or at least cap , his support with those voters			0
" the @entity0 @entity3 @entity8 insiders were surveyed from the evening of jan. 16 thru the morning of january 18 , and again between january 19 and the morning of january 20			1
the survey was conducted over the internet ; some interviews were conducted by phone			0
the @entity3 insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses			0
and while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns , two - thirds said they had neither endorsed nor were they working for any candidate in the race			0
here are the names of the participants in the survey : @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 .			0
