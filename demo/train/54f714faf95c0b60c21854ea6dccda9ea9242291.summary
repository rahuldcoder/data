on the surface , @entity0 transmits an image of prosperity , comfort and convenience			1
but beyond the façade of pristine skyscrapers and bustling shopping malls , a darker life exists for some of the territory 's newest residents			1
deep into @entity0 's @entity13 , close to the border with @entity15 , lies @entity16 , a decrepit village that has become a prison for many of its inhabitants			1
one of them is @entity22 , 26 , a wiry , long - haired asylum - seeker from @entity23			2
his house , barely more than a few slabs of sheet metal propped against decaying beams , runs along open sewers			2
flies circle near the improvised toilet -- basically a hole in the kitchen floor			2
the water is dirty and the electricity supply unreliable			0
with only a shoddy air conditioner salvaged from a garbage dump , he mostly wilts in the humid summer weather and freezes in the winter cold			0
one night , while sleeping , part of the roof dropped onto his head			0
" i need to live in a better place , " he says , with a hint of irritation			0
@entity22 's nightmarish living situation is typical for the hundreds of people who arrive in @entity0 each year to escape torture or persecution in their home countries			1
but that 's when their troubles begin			1
while they wait for their claims to be screened , in a process that can take years -- and usually ends in rejection -- asylum seekers are barred from working , forced into crumbling housing and are given just enough food to survive			1
according to some rights activists , this is intentional			1
" the government tries to dissuade refugees from seeking protection by intentionally causing hardship , " explains @entity62 , who directs @entity63 , a @entity0 refugee aid organization			1
" it 's not humane			1
" with no way to join society and no way to return home , these survivors languish in miserable situations like @entity16 , hoping for a reprieve that often never comes			0
" many of us came here to save our lives , " says @entity22			1
" but i think better die			0
better die than live like this			0
how we 're living is not life			1
" ' i lost everything ' four years ago , @entity22 was a pharmacology student in the @entity86 district of @entity23			1
described by @entity62 as a " really smart kid , " @entity22 ran a business to support his family			0
but his success drew the envy of terrorist groups in the war - torn country , who burned his vehicle , assaulted him , and threatened to kill him if he did n't pay huge sums of " protection " money			0
fearing for his life , he enlisted the help of an agent , who promised to take him to @entity104 , his " dream country			0
" instead , the agent stole his belongings and left him stranded in @entity0			1
" i lost everything , " says @entity22			0
" when i learned i was in @entity0 , i was so shocked			1
" @entity22 was safe , in a technical sense			0
like many other countries and territories , @entity0 is bound by international laws preventing the deportation of refugees to countries where they risk harm			1
refugees are allowed to file claims for protection when they arrive , and may legally remain until their status is officially determined			1
those who are successful may be relocated to a third country , where they can attain legal status			0
in theory , @entity0 is a big " waiting room			1
" in practice , @entity0 is more of a prison			1
left with unpleasant memories of the 1970s influx of @entity132 war refugees , which swamped its support systems , the @entity0 government does everything it can to discourage refugees from integrating into its society			1
to prevent economic migrants from trying to claim asylum , the government bans refugees from working -- those caught working face 22 months in jail			1
instead , it forces refugees like @entity22 to depend on a non-profit , the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) , for welfare			1
every month , @entity144 gives @entity22 a hk $ 1,200 ( $ 155 ) stipend for rent -- which barely covers his room in @entity16 , with nothing left for deposits or utilities			0
like other refugees , he gets hk $ 900 ( $ 116 ) worth of food -- a bit more than us $ 1 per meal -- which must be picked up from faraway collection depots and then carried home			1
the aid amount has not been adjusted for inflation since 2006			0
" i 've watched the 7 kg bag of rice turn into 3 kg , " says @entity62 , who works closely with the villagers			0
" people are going hungry			0
" @entity165 is a 43 - year - old asylum seeker from @entity23 who lives with @entity22			1
nine years ago , he escaped @entity23 after terrorists seized his retail business and tried to kill his family			1
but , he says , " @entity0 is not a better life			1
" his broad frame fills his cramped bedroom , which is littered with filth - encrusted objects : old appliances , cookware , and furniture , many held together with tape			0
because @entity144 aid only covers the bare minimum , @entity165 and his cohabitants hunt for clothes and other household essentials in a nearby garbage dump			0
@entity165 says the @entity144 does not provide adequate medical care			1
" when i am sick , the doctors say , ' we can not check you			0
' " instead they give him tablets of @entity188 , a feeble painkiller that @entity62 says refugees receive " whether they have migraines , dermatitis , venereal diseases , cancer , or are giving birth			1
" " the suffering caused is purposeful , " continues @entity62			0
" [ the government ] causes so much slow pain that the people have no choice but to leave			1
" however , a spokeswoman for @entity144 says that each client is " individually assessed for needs , special concerns , and vulnerabilities , " and that medical assistance is provided at the discretion of social workers			2
in response to suggestions that aid is insufficient , she replies " any assistance program will always be a compromise			0
" @entity144 does not determine aid levels , she adds , as the agency is funded directly by the government and only carries out government instructions			2
officials stand behind the austere policy , which they say is designed to keep its welfare system from getting overloaded with outsiders			0
" the objective of humanitarian assistance is to provide support , which is considered sufficient to prevent a person from becoming destitute while at the same time not creating a magnet effect , " @entity0 's @entity223 wrote in a statement emailed to @entity225			1
@entity165 has a simpler explanation : " the @entity0 government does n't care			1
to them , we are not people			0
" ' like finding out heaven is fake ' claimants who persist long enough to receive a status determination are often devastated to find they have been rejected without explanation			2
according to @entity63 , @entity0 has received over 12,000 torture claims in the last 21 years -- and has accepted five			1
" this number is unbelievable , " says @entity62			0
" it 's an effective zero percent recognition rate			2
" for those in @entity16 waiting to be screened , these figures cause despair			0
" it 's a tunnel with no light at the end , " says @entity62			2
" when it dawns on refugees what they 're stuck in , they 're in shock			2
they conclude that @entity0 is safe , but they would 've rather died			1
it 's like finding out that heaven is fake			2
" to alleviate refugees ' suffering , a small group of @entity260 has formed what it calls the @entity263 to try and coordinate help			2
one of its members is @entity267 , who manages a refugee aid center in @entity0 's @entity269			1
the center provides psycho - social support for more than 300 clients			0
but the work , she says , is very difficult			2
in her first month on the job , a man suddenly broke down into tears			0
" he pulled up his shirt and showed me stab wounds all over his torso and started explaining what has happened in his country			0
" when he left and shut the door behind him , i lost it			0
i spent 30 minutes crying , just saying , ' my @entity287 , how can we help someone who has been so deeply , deeply wounded ? ' " @entity62 says that the aid organizations simply can not help everyone			0
" all the charities combined only have about three million hkd ( us $ 128,926 )			0
we need hundreds of millions , " he says			0
" our work might help five hundred people a little , but how do you help 6,000 ? " we have to put pressure on the government , " he adds			1
@entity0 legislator @entity299 is one of the few politicians trying to help			1
he first visited @entity16 in february and describes the sight as " shameful			0
" @entity299 immediately demanded a special meeting with the @entity303 to voice his concerns , but was rejected			2
" they are trying to evade the problem , " he says			0
unsatisfied , @entity299 believes that government inaction jeopardizes @entity0 's international reputation			1
" the government wants to project @entity0 as a world - class city with advanced systems			1
" but the city is in many ways a façade , " he says			0
" on the outside , it 's got nice decorations			2
but if you look inside , it 's empty -- there 's no heart			2
" there has been minor progress			0
late last year , court rulings determined that @entity0 's refugee screening systems were incomplete			1
in june , the government announced a new system , which will screen not just torture claimants but all sufferers of persecution and cruel treatment			2
" it 's a step in the right direction , " says @entity299			2
but there are no improvements planned for refugee welfare -- which is the most urgently needed reform			0
a provision allowing refugees to seek employment would raise living conditions immeasurably , but this seems a remote possibility at best			1
if things do n't improve soon , @entity0 's treatment of refugees will continue to fall short of the international standards it claims to embrace , and @entity16 will continue to wither			1
advocates say change is possible but only if people understand what the refugees are going through			1
" being an asylum seeker , refugee , or torture claimant is not a choice people make , " says @entity355			2
" some seismic event has just turned that person 's life upside down			2
if they could just go home and be safe , they would -- but they ca n't			0
it 's important to remember it could be you -- it could be me -- it could happen any second			2
" as for @entity165 , all he wants is an opportunity for dignity			0
" in the @entity380 , @entity378 , @entity379 , they give people a chance , " he says			0
we should give a chance to everyone			0

advocates say @entity0 government policies make refugees ' lives ' a living hell '
barred from work , refugees are given poor housing , meager food , and little medical care
refugees wait years for their claims to be processed , but are almost always rejected
human rights advocates say @entity0 's international reputation is at risk
