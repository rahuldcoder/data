the rollout of the federal @entity2 website has been a disaster , full stop			1
there can be no excuses , nor will i be making any			0
it 's been clear for years what needed to be done , and failing was not an option			1
the exchanges , and the website that allowed access to them , had to work , and they just do not			0
i wrote a week or two ago that the initial problems with the @entity19 website appeared to be because of volume issues			1
that could be spun as either a positive or negative thing			0
but it now seems that the surge was not the cause of the malfunctions			0
after the first weekend , when the administration added additional capacity to the servers , the issues did n't go away			2
what are they ? i wish i could say for sure			0
but some good reports have come out that detail just a few of the problems			2
have you had trouble signing up ? tell us your experience the first appears to be that the administration decided that people would need to provide a significant amount of personal detail to look at coverage options			2
i can attest to this first - hand			0
i have insurance through my work , so i do n't need exchange coverage , but i was still interested in looking at what was available			2
i had to provide a lot of information , about my job and family , before i could do so			0
it 's possible that this was because administrators wanted to be able to provide subsidy information to people with the premium costs , so as to soften the blow of how expensive insurance could be , but no one knows for sure			1
regardless , this complicated things significantly			0
but that 's just the front end			1
the back end is also a real problem			1
insurance companies are reporting that the data they are receiving from the @entity19 website is garbled			1
this means that automatic processing of the insurance plans being ordered is impossible			2
oddly enough , the problems on the front end are actually helping here			1
so few orders are actually making it through that insurance companies are able to sort through the bad data by hand to complete enrollment			2
but if things improve on the front end , then there 's no way these companies can do millions of applications without good data			1
the administration is bragging that upwards of half a million applications have started			2
shockingly few of them have been completed , though			0
the front end has a number of steps , including submitting your information , assessing for eligibility and then shopping for insurance			1
the number being cited by the administration refers only to people who have completed the first step			1
there are people who believe that government can never do things as well as the private sector			0
i 'm not one of those people			0
but in this specific instance , those people have a point			0
evidently , those in charge of the rollout of the exchange website were unprepared			2
they did n't have the necessary experience to manage the more than 50 different contractors producing software independently that would eventually need to function together as a whole			0
this is incredibly technical work , and it 's not clear that government was in a good position to direct things here			2
it appears that the @entity132 administration has learned its lesson			2
administration officials are now calling in " more computer experts " to try and fix the problem			1
but this may be too little , too late			0
some are saying that even if the administration pours in massive resources , the problems may not be fixed by december 15 , the deadline for when insurance needs to be bought for it to be covering people on january 1			1
even if the administration can get this done within a month , some in the insurance industry are concerned that these issues may act as a filter to dissuade healthy people from getting insurance			1
if it 's really , really hard to complete an application , then only truly ill people may have the perseverance to do so			1
that could lead to problems in the pool of people signing up for insurance			1
the administration needs healthy people to buy insurance , too , for the exchanges to function optimally if we were talking about a company having mismanaged things so badly , you could be sure that heads would roll			1
many would be fired , and there would be a change in management			0
but that may not be possible here			0
were @entity172 secretary @entity171 to go , president @entity132 could n't get someone else vetted and through the @entity175 nomination process in an expedient manner			0
he 's likely stuck with his current team , or no team at all			0
that does n't mean @entity2 will fail			1
it 's still possible that this could all be fixed			0
it 's also possible that should significant issues continue , timelines might be adjusted to accommodate implementation issues			0
but these will cause problems political and real in nature			1
continued failures in the exchange rollout give the president 's opponents fuel to attack him and his health care reform			1
more importantly , they prevent people who really do need insurance , and the care it allows , from getting what they need .			0

@entity200 : @entity2 rollout has been a disaster ; there 's no excuse for it
he says problems at front end of process make it hard to get even through first step
he says insurance firms getting garbled date ; administration calling in it experts
@entity200 : @entity2 needed , but these first days have created problems political and real
