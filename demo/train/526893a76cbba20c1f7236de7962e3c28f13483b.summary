@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's sort of like they 're all dressed up with no place to go			0
but preparing for oil on your shore is not exactly a night out on the town			1
@entity1 @entity11 counties say they 're frustrated beyond belief , after putting in elaborate , exhaustive plans to stop the oil , only to find that @entity16 's check is n't even in the mail			1
" we 've got our permits			0
we 've got everything signed off and ready to go , " said @entity20 , director of public safety in @entity21			0
" the holdup now is @entity16			1
we have no money to do the protective measures			1
" @entity21 has created a multi-layered plan to try to stop the oil from coming onto its beaches and to protect the @entity31 waterway , an area enjoyed by boaters and beachgoers			1
county officials plan on using barges , containment boom and an air net to stop the flow of crude , but they need all of these things in place for their plan to work			1
and the thing they need most is $ 2.8 million up front and $ 2.5 million a month to stay operational -- money they 've filed for with @entity16			1
are you there ? send us your images " we 're virtually operating on a credit card			0
this is a county that 's reserves are low			0
we 're impacted by a reduction in ad valorem taxes , " said @entity20			0
@entity1 sen. @entity58 says he 's seen the same thing happen all throughout this process			0
" you had the @entity62 doing one thing and you had @entity16 doing another thing and this is why i 've been raising cane for weeks , " said @entity58			1
@entity58 met with @entity21 officials who asked for his help in getting their check			2
" this county and a lot of these other little counties that simply do n't have the financial wherewithall to be paying all of these bills , and they 've got to have some relief			2
they will get their money			2
" after the meeting , @entity2 questioned @entity16 's community cupport coordinator assigned to @entity21 , @entity80			1
asked if checks were coming and how soon , @entity80 responded , " i ca n't speak to how soon they will get it , but i can tell you , there is a process in place and we 're working to get those refunds			2
" " this whole process is new and everybody is learning as they go and trying to figure out what makes the most sense , and that 's what they 're working on			0
" pressed on the delay in the counties receiving funds , @entity80 responded , " like i say , they 've set out some guidelines on how to get the reimbursement and the county has filed , is my understanding , and i have to run some traps to figure out where it is in the process and see what the answer is to that			1
i just ca n't tell you right now			0
" but the counties say there is no real process , and what does exist has been painful for everyone staring at the same problem			2
" i kind of make a joke			2
we 're on plan @entity127 we 've already gone through plans a through @entity129 , " says @entity121 , bureau chief for management and budget services in @entity124			2
" a check or money order , or a wire			2
anything they want to give us is fine			0
" @entity124 has a $ 9.1 million claim with @entity16 for its oil protection including booms , reconnaissance flights , and operations			1
the county says it also needs $ 4.8 million a month to maintain the plan , for as long as the oil remains a problem			0
@entity121 says the good news is that @entity16 is returning her phone calls , but the bad news is what she 's hearing is n't helping			1
" we 're definitely hearing back from them , but they keep saying that the process has changed			0
they say , ' we know you 've submitted a claim , ' but they say , ' the process has changed and you have to re-submit the claim and paperwork			0
' " and in the eastern @entity162 , @entity160 , which includes @entity161 , has had the same problem			1
county officials say they need $ 3 million to build a more robust boom system , and about $ 8,300 per day to maintain it			1
other costs , like workers ' overtime pay , are estimated at $ 10,000 per day			0
officials of the @entity1 @entity170 and emergency managers are scheduled to meet on wednesday with @entity62 representatives and @entity16 officials because , they say , they need the claims process to be fixed right now			1
the chairman of the @entity176 , @entity177 , went right to the point			0
" we just need them to show me the money , " he said			1
" if they give us an @entity184 diamond or black ( card ) , i 'm happy with it			0

@entity162 counties *waiting* on checks from @entity16
counties have elaborate plans to block oil but need @entity16 money to make plans reality
officials say reimbursement system keeps changing
" we just need them to show me the money , " says one official
