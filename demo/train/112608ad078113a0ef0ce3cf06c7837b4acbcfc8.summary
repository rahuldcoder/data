-- @entity1 claimed a sixth victory in the @entity3 to @entity5 yacht race on thursday after producing a record time to see off the opposition			1
the super-maxi crossed the line with an official time of one day , 18 hours , 23 minutes and 12 seconds to claim victory in the prestigious 628 - nautical mile bluewater classic			1
it broke its own previous record of one day , 18 hours , 40 minutes and 10 seconds , which it set back in 2005			1
it also won the race every year from 2005 - 08 and in 2010 but last year was narrowly beaten by @entity16 , which finished a distant second this time under the new name of @entity16			1
" last year we were beaten by by three minutes , which was very disappointing			1
this year we beat them by much more , " skipper @entity21 told the race 's official website after coming home with 45 nautical miles to spare			2
the record had looked like slipping out of his grasp as conditions lightened going up the @entity30 , but @entity31 ordered a bigger mainsail to keep momentum going			2
" we just kept chipping away			2
you expect it to be light in the @entity30 and it did get lighter towards the end			0
this is a very testing event and the @entity39 is very , very , testing			0
it 's always a tough race , " he said			2
" we had some very hard and fast running conditions ; we blew out a spinnaker and had some gear failure , so it was n't all smooth sailing			0
" most of the crew have been together since 2005 , with @entity51 celebrating his 25th race with a record 10th line honors victory			1
official race website @entity1 became only the second boat in the event to break its own record			1
" we 'll try to do it again next year , " owner @entity58 said			0
" new wings on the keel helped enormously i 'm sure , so did the new jib			0
the design , the crew , the sails and the modifications are what makes the boat fast			0
" @entity16 , skippered by 85 - year - old @entity69 , was confirmed in second ahead of @entity71 after being cleared of making an early start on wednesday			1
an international jury ruled friday that race officials had failed to inform @entity75 that he had jumped the gun			2
@entity75 was left to rue problems with damaged headsail equipment on the first night of the race			2
" we had a bit of trouble , " he said after finishing his 44th @entity5 in one day , 23 hours and eight minutes and 44 seconds			1
" we 're new to the boat , we 've only had it two months			0
i think we did pretty well			0
the boys pushed the boat really hard , it 's just unfortunate that things broke or went wrong			0
" the race , being held for the 68th time , is known as one of the toughest in the world			1
the 1998 edition ended with just 44 of the 115 entries completing the journey , as five boats sank and six people died			0
living doll was the first yacht of the 76 - strong fleet to withdraw from this year 's event , suffering a broken rudder near the middle of @entity105 , 90 nautical miles north east of @entity106			1
" @entity107 has been advised that the crew are all in good shape and that they are managing by themselves			0
they have not asked any other yacht to stand by , " the @entity3 - @entity5 website reported thursday			1
it was followed by @entity114 ( damaged mainsail ) and @entity116 , which developed steering issues .			0
