the body of one of the two men accused of pulling off the @entity4 attack has been buried in rural @entity5 -- a development that local officials said caught them totally " off guard			1
" @entity13 's remains were accepted " by an interfaith coalition in that community -- they responded to our calls , " his uncle @entity9 , of @entity11 , told @entity17			1
the body was buried in an unmarked grave in a @entity21 cemetery in @entity22 , @entity5 , according to @entity9			1
" my tradition was that of a @entity21 , and i have that tradition of burial , and people helped me with that , " he said in a phone interview			0
the death certificate released by @entity32 authorities indicates that @entity13 , whose cause of death was listed as gunshot wounds and " blunt trauma to ( his ) head and torso , " was interred at @entity40 in @entity22 , which is about 25 minutes north of @entity41 in a rural county of about 30,000 people			1
while the news came out friday , @entity45 from the @entity46 of @entity41 said @entity13 was actually buried the previous morning			1
speaking friday from the cemetery , which his organization owns , @entity45 said there was " no intention to ... make anybody angry , " but that he and others felt obligated to do what " @entity51 says to do " by putting @entity13 's " body back into the earth			1
" " it 's not a political thing ( but ) he ca n't bury himself , " said @entity45 , adding his only regret was that @entity13 " was n't buried sooner			1
" " ... whether he was @entity61 , @entity21 , @entity62 , atheist , when you 're dead you need to be buried or taken care of , not just left in a funeral home			1
" police in @entity67 , @entity32 , had announced thursday a " courageous and compassionate individual came forward " to take @entity13 's remains out of @entity67 , where the body had been at a funeral home while @entity9 and officials tried to determine what to do with it			1
the chairman of the @entity76 , @entity5 , board of supervisors , @entity78 , said friday afternoon he could n't then confirm or deny that @entity13 is buried in his county and that he had n't seen the death certificate			1
as he pointed out , " standard practice " is that local officials are not notified that a burial is taking place			1
according to @entity78 and county sheriff @entity89 , neither they or any other officials in the county knew about plans to bury @entity13 in that area			1
they were not consulted , nor did they provide permission for such a burial to happen , said @entity78			2
at the least , he later told @entity17 , county officials " would have preferred to be in a position to ... prepare for it a little better			0
" news of @entity13 's burial in the county upset residents like @entity103 , who said she thinks the body should have been taken to where his parents are in southern @entity107			1
" he killed @entity108 on @entity108 soil , therefore he should n't be buried here , " she told @entity17			2
at friday 's press conference , @entity78 acknowledged residents ' concerns and said " i understand how you feel , and i feel the same way			0
" he said @entity76 does not want to be associated with such a " terrible crime " that took place more than 500 miles away , even though @entity13 has " no ties to @entity76			2
" " we do not wish to be the home of the remains of one of those perpetrators , " he said			0
@entity89 , the county 's sheriff , said members of @entity5 attorney general @entity127 's office are also looking into the matter " to make sure all legalities were being followed			1
" but unless something was n't done right -- in which case , @entity78 said , " we would look into undoing what happened " -- officials ' hands are tied , he said			2
" as long as everything was done legally , there 's really very little that we can do , " @entity78 said			0
officials were also concerned about securing the private cemetery against possible trespassing protesters or those who might attempt to deface the grave site			2
while a sheriff 's deputy was stationed there friday , officials said the county does not have money set aside to provide security			2
it 's all a headache that @entity78 , for one , never saw coming			0
" of all the localities in the @entity108 , this was probably the last one we would have thought of , " he said			0
what would happen to the body of the man who , along with his younger brother , @entity155 , was accused of setting off two deadly explosions at the @entity4 on april 15 had been a nearly month - long puzzle			0
the body of @entity13 , killed in a police pursuit days after the bombings , went unclaimed for nearly two weeks			2
a funeral home in @entity67 -- about 40 miles west of downtown @entity162 -- eventually accepted the remains			0
but protesters in @entity67 made it clear they did n't want the body buried there , with one holding a sign that read , " @entity169 the garbage in the landfill			2
" and the city manager of @entity173 , @entity32 , where @entity13 lived , said he would not allow @entity174 to be buried in the city , asserting that possible protests and media coverage would disrupt the community			2
it also appeared that sending the body overseas was an unlikely option -- @entity13 's parents in the @entity107 region of @entity185 said they would not fly his body back to @entity107 for burial , citing passport problems , spokeswoman @entity182 said			1
in a press release issued friday , the @entity189 said that a " private @entity5 citizen " and licensed counselor named @entity197 " quietly coordinated efforts to resolve the problem of where to bury @entity13 's remains			1
" that included e-mails exchanged with representatives of the church she belonged to , as well as local muslim , @entity62 and @entity205 representatives			0
she contacted @entity67 police " after receiving an offer of a burial plot from the administration of the @entity46 of @entity5 , " the society said			1
@entity197 also talked with her local pastor about the moral implications of her spearheading the effort			0
" @entity215 tells us , ' love your enemies , ' " she said , according to the @entity189			0
" not to hate them , even after they are dead			0
" @entity45 , who is vice president of the @entity46 of @entity5 and attended thursday 's burial , stressed friday " there is no agreement with ( @entity13 's ) actions , whatsover , in any form or fashion			1
" at the same time , he said " somebody needed to take responsibility			0
" " we were able to do so , and that 's what we did , " he said			0
@entity13 's mother , @entity174 , appeared confused by thursday 's announcement from @entity67 police			2
speaking to @entity17 from @entity107 by phone thursday evening , @entity174 said she did n't know whether her son was buried or where			0
@entity9 -- who was the main point of contact over what to do with @entity13 's remains , according to @entity45 -- said friday that he called his nephew 's father thursday " to give him an update , but i did not tell him where he was buried			1
" " he did n't even ask me , " @entity9 said			0
@entity174 told @entity17 in late april that her husband could n't travel to the @entity108 , saying he was too ill. she said she eventually would be interested in heading to the @entity108 to see her younger son , despite pending shoplifting charges against her in @entity32 , where she once lived			0
@entity9 said friday he was " completely outraged that ( the parents ) have not been here for their children			0
" " my assumption is that they must be here , just to help with the investigation at least , " @entity9 said .			0

" it 's not a political thing ( but ) he ca n't bury himself , " an @entity46 group official says
the death certificate says @entity13 is buried at @entity40 in @entity5
a @entity61 woman spearheaded the effort to find a burial site , @entity46 group says
local officials say they were n't consulted , though that 's " standard practice " for burials
