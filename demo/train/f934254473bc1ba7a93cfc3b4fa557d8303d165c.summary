in the aftermath of the heinous attacks on the satirical newspaper @entity3 in @entity4 , many are tweeting and writing in solidarity : @entity7 suis @entity8			1
because i am not @entity8			0
of course , i unequivocally support the right to free speech			1
and i also believe in choosing to exercise that right responsibly and respectfully			0
that 's why i would not have published cartoons depicting @entity15 , insulting 1.6 billion @entity16 worldwide in the process ( and no , i would n't have published many of @entity3 's cartoons insulting @entity20 and @entity21 , either )			1
in no way should this be taken -- as it has been by some on @entity25 -- to suggest that i somehow condone the killings of @entity3 's staff			1
that 's a ridiculously insulting idea and just plain wrong			0
it 's possible to honor and protect the free speech rights of publications like @entity3 while simultaneously believing such cartoons are unnecessarily disrespectful and offensive			1
as others have pointed out , in the wake of the @entity37 attacks we 've conflated support for free speech with support for the actual speech in question			1
but while i unquestionably support the free speech rights of the @entity45 and " god hates fags " protesters , for example , that clearly does n't mean i would support , never mind join in , their hateful messages			1
some on the right insist that media should have to re-print @entity3 's anti-islam cartoons or else they 're cowardly			1
however , this is a fundamental perversion of free speech , to say the least			1
there is no inconsistency between supporting free speech for @entity3 's cartoonists and finding the content of some of their cartoons offensive and disrespectful			1
i do n't profess to be a scholar of @entity66			2
but it 's plain that some branches or interpretations of the faith view any depictions of the @entity15 as blasphemy			0
that does n't mean that all muslims who see such depictions as blasphemy think the appropriate response is violence ; far from it			0
but a radical few do , and , as @entity82 commentator @entity81 has argued , they exploit such defamations against the prophet to try to radicalize others in the faith			0
unfortunately , there are some in the @entity88 who think all of @entity66 is tainted , and who -- despite there being plenty of violence and intolerance in the texts and histories of @entity20 and @entity21 -- believe @entity66 is somehow uniquely violent and intolerant			2
but when we mistakenly believe that a narrow and violent interpretation of @entity66 is the only true version , we play right into the hands of the radical zealots who want the world , including all @entity16 , to believe precisely that			2
the reality is that the @entity66 world is n't just the leadership of @entity108 and @entity109 , but also @entity110 and @entity111			2
and it 's worth pointing out that several @entity66 countries have elected or appointed female heads of state , something the @entity116 has yet to manage			1
and also that while much remains to be done on advancing gay rights , gay bars do still exist in @entity119 and in @entity120			0
unfortunately , about 60 percent of @entity116 do n't know a single muslim , and so may only know about @entity66 what the media reports about terrorists			2
it is important to remember that there are a wide variety of interpretations and practices of @entity66 worldwide , including an active debate on those interpretations among scholars and spiritual leaders			2
sadly , i have to wonder if @entity3 had been attacked for cartoons insulting @entity136 , whether there would be a similar outpouring in support of the magazine , especially in the @entity116			2
after all , many of the same people outraged just a month ago about the alleged " @entity143 " have no qualms about launching a " @entity145 " because , well , it 's not their religion being mischaracterized and insulted			0
it unsettles me to think that the reason so much of the outpouring of support for @entity3 is driven not just by the violence suffered or a defense of free speech , but by the opportunity to implicitly support jabs at @entity66			1
but judging by some of the coverage , it seems a fair assumption to make			0
indeed , on the same day of the attack in @entity37 , a bomb was placed outside the offices of an @entity165 chapter in @entity166			0
thankfully , no one died in that attack , but it was still a bomb on @entity116 soil and yet the story was absent from much of the mainstream media			0
had @entity16 been the suspects , i think it 's fair to say there would have been much more attention paid			0
as someone with a public voice , my free speech benefits from an extra megaphone , and while the principle of free speech means i can say what i want whenever i want it , in practice i try to think carefully about the impact of my words -- and how they might be felt among others whether or not they share my belief system			1
personally , i believe in not saying something just because i want to speak , but because i want to be heard			0
so , for instance , i do n't casually condemn or denigrate people 's religions because i want people of faith to hear me			0
all religions face the struggle of progressing from rigid tradition to evolving modernity , and so i want my voice to be clear and constructive in supporting that progress			0
put another way , when i open my mouth , i do n't want to be part of the problem , i want to be part of the solution			0
i want to help @entity66 and @entity21 and @entity20 and society in general become more open and inclusive and democratic and liberated			2
free speech is fundamentally essential to that project			1
in the aftermath of the heinous attacks in @entity37 , it 's important we remember that free speech and respect can go hand - in - hand .			1

@entity220 : it 's possible to back free speech but *object* to @entity3 cartoons
@entity220 warns not to dismiss all of @entity66 as extreme
