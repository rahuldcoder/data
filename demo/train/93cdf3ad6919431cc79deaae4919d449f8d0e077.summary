@entity0 -- a group representing survivors of sexual abuse by priests named a " @entity9 " list of cardinals it said would be the worst candidates for pope based on their handling of child sex abuse claims or their public comments about the cases			1
the list names three @entity19 @entity18 cardinals and nine from other countries			1
watch for the smoke : how is a new pope elected ? @entity24 , the @entity25 , said as it released the list wednesday that its accusations were based on media reports , legal filings and victims ' statements			0
a representative for one of the cardinals on list dismissed the group			1
the remaining cardinals or their representatives could n't be immediately reached by @entity1 for comment wednesday			1
" i 'm not going to respond to this group which has little to no credibility , " said @entity40 , a spokesman for cardinal @entity41 of @entity42			1
when asked about the @entity24 list , the rev. @entity44 , a spokesman for the @entity45 , told @entity1 : " we believe it is not up to @entity24 to decide who comes to conclave and who is chosen			1
... cardinals can decide themselves without asking @entity24 for advice			1
" @entity44 and another @entity45 spokesman , the rev. @entity53 , read the @entity24 press release together , @entity53 said			1
@entity44 declined to comment further			2
the two other @entity19 cardinals on the list are @entity59 of @entity60 and @entity61 of @entity62 , the group said			1
a spokeswoman for @entity61 declined to comment			2
the others listed are @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 of @entity68 , @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 or the @entity72 , @entity73 of @entity74 , @entity75 of @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 of @entity79 , and @entity80 of @entity81 , the group said			2
not all of them are linked to alleged coverups of sexual abuse , @entity24 said			2
some were placed on the list because of their public remarks related to the abuse scandal , @entity24 said			2
on monday , @entity24 also called for some of the older cardinals to remove themselves from the meetings held before the election of the new pope , arguing that some have been accused of complicity in protecting priests accused of sexually abusing children			2
cardinals from around the globe have been summoned to @entity0 to take part in the process of choosing the next pontiff , after the resignation of pope @entity104 last week			2
as of midday , 113 of the 115 cardinals eligible to elect the new pope are in @entity0 , according to @entity44			2
to be eligible to be a part of the group , a cardinal must be under the age of 80			1
the two cardinal - electors who are not yet there are @entity113 of @entity114 , who was due to arrive later wednesday , and @entity116 @entity115 of @entity117 , who is arriving thursday			2
interactive : a look at possible papal contenders no date has yet been proposed for the secret election , or conclave , to select the former pontiff 's successor			2
meanwhile , a new study says @entity19 @entity18 view sex abuse by clergy as the most important problem facing the church today , according to the @entity131			1
when asked to put in their own words what 's the most pressing issue facing their church , 34 % of the @entity19 @entity18 questioned cite pedophilia , sex abuse or another phrase for the same problem , @entity131 said			1
no other problem received a more than 10 % response ; the next biggest issue named is low trust and low credibility , at 9 % , @entity131 said			0
' @entity145 did n't work ' @entity24 is intentionally focusing on candidates with a realistic chance of being named pope , its executive director @entity146 said wednesday as the group released its list			1
" the single quickest and most effective step would be for the next pope to clearly discipline , demote , denounce and even defrock cardinals and bishops who are concealing child sex crimes			0
we think that 's the missing piece , " he said			0
the new pope should order each bishop around the world to hand over " every piece of paper he has on proven , admitted or credibly accused child - molesting clerics to law enforcement , " @entity146 said			0
@entity168 , victims ' outreach director for @entity24 , said : " the short answer is we 've tried silence , silence did n't work , so we have to speak out			0
we have to do everything we can to get this information out there			0
" the @entity18 has been rocked by a series of child sex abuse scandals in recent years -- and the new pope will be under pressure to deal more effectively with a crisis that has shaken public confidence in the church			0
@entity24 says it 's vital to look at how the world 's bishops have handled claims of abuse by priests because the crisis is far from over			1
" this scandal , we believe , has yet to surface in most nations			0
it 's shameless spin and deliberate deception to claim otherwise			0
it 's tempting to reassure the public and the parishioners by making this claim			0
but it 's also irresponsible , " a statement on @entity24 's website said			0
" clergy sex crimes and coverups remain deeply hidden in the vast majority of nations ( where most @entity18 live ) , and has really only become widely known -- and barely addressed -- in the @entity19 about a decade ago and in a few @entity205 countries even more recently			1
" what 's in a name ? clues to be found in next pope 's moniker media leaks concern a news conference scheduled by @entity19 cardinals for wednesday , following media briefings on monday and tuesday , was canceled at short notice			1
asked if the @entity45 had told the @entity19 cardinals to stop their daily media briefings , @entity45 spokesman @entity53 suggested that the details of what was discussed in the general congregations were not meant to be publicized			1
" it 's not up to @entity222 or myself to tell them what to do , " he said			0
" it could be that among themselves they realized that there are different ways and different methods of getting things out			0
" sister @entity233 , director of media relations for the @entity235 , said via e-mail that the @entity19 cardinals were committed to transparency and had wanted to share " a process - related overview of their work " with the public " in order to inform while ensuring the confidentiality " of the general congregations			1
" due to concerns over accounts being reported in the @entity79 press , which breached confidentiality , the @entity246 has agreed not to give interviews , " she said			1
in total , 153 cardinals gathered wednesday at the @entity45 for a third day of meetings , known as general congregations , before they set the timetable for the election			1
the cardinals spoke about new evangelization , restructuring of the church hierarchy , or curia , and the need for good governance of the church , @entity44 said			0
a five - minute limit has been imposed on cardinals speaking at the meetings , although the microphone is not being switched off if they run over the time allowed			0
the cardinals have decided to meet twice thursday , in the morning and afternoon , in order to " intensify the rhythm of work , " @entity44 said			0
video shown at a @entity45 news conference showed workers preparing the @entity278 for the secretive conclave			2
an elevated floor is being put in place to protect the elaborate mosaic tiling , said @entity44 , where seats will be placed for the cardinals			0
the @entity278 and its ornate ceiling by @entity287 are normally a must - see for tourists in @entity0 , but it was closed to the public beginning tuesday afternoon to allow for preparations to take place			0
@entity1 's @entity292 and @entity293 reported from @entity0 , and @entity294 reported and wrote in @entity295			0
@entity1 's @entity296 also contributed to this report .			0
