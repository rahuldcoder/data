-- according to new data released by the @entity4 this week , median household incomes adjusted for inflation declined by 2.3 % in 2010 over the previous year			1
the data also showed that 46.2 million @entity6 lived in poverty in 2010 -- the highest number in the 52 years the @entity4 has been tracking such data			1
but that data is even more depressing in contrast to the skyrocketing fortunes of @entity6 's super-rich			0
between the second quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010 , our nation 's total income rose by $ 528 billion			0
of that economic growth , $ 464 billion went to pretax corporate profits			0
just $ 7 billion went to wages and salaries			0
in other words , 88 % of the brief recovery went to corporate profits and just 1 % -- that 's right , 1 % -- went to workers , according to a study by economists at @entity29			0
by contrast , when the @entity6 was recovering from a downturn in the early 1990s , 50 % of the growth in the national income went to wages and salaries			2
( and actually , in that period leading up to the tech boom , average corporate profits declined 1 %			0
) it 's not that working @entity6 are n't working hard			2
worker productivity has risen steadily , but wages have still been stagnant			0
but the income of the top 1 % of @entity6 ? rapidly rising			0
at what point do we realize enough is enough -- that giving more and more money and power to big business and the super-rich will never translate into more jobs , better wages and a better economy but simply more yachts and luxury villas ? at what point do we realize that conservative anti-tax extremism is nothing but blatant greed masquerading as lousy economics ? at what point do we realize that class warfare is n't a liberal goal but in fact a conservative reality , advanced through decades of policies that help the rich cheat the middle class ? according to @entity67 economist and former @entity69 adviser @entity68 , the actual tax rate paid by the wealthy and big business is the lowest in several generations			1
thanks to the @entity75 tax cuts , the super-rich paid an average of 17 % on their federal income tax in 2007 -- less than many middle class @entity6 paid			2
for instance , multibillionare @entity80 pays a lower percentage of income tax than everyone else in his office , including the secretaries			0
in 1992 , the rich averaged a 26 % income tax			2
a study earlier this month reported that 25 of the largest and most profitable corporations in the @entity6 paid their ceos more money than their entire corporations paid in taxes			1
meanwhile , corporations are earning record profits and sitting on record cash reserves -- upwards of $ 2 trillion dollars			2
anyone who can look at these numbers and think the rich need more help is crazy			2
stop calling big business the " job creators			1
" they have all the resources imaginable and they 're still not creating jobs			0
it 's time to put more money in the pockets of working @entity6 so they can spend it , create demand and finally kick - start the economy			1
president @entity113 has proposed a comprehensive plan that will create good jobs while rebuilding @entity6 's infrastructure for the 21st century			1
in the president 's plan , a portion of the costs will be offset by reducing the tax - deductible exemptions for well - off families , taxing hedge fund manager income as income rather than discounted capital gains , closing loopholes that give government handouts to the oil and gas industry and taxing corporate jets with the same depreciation schedule as personal jets			0
for crying out loud , why not ? why we should continue to let working @entity6 suffer while helping the super-rich get richer ? most @entity6 agree with the president			0
almost three in four @entity6 support raising taxes on the wealthy so we can put government to work getting all of @entity6 working again , according to a @entity139 poll			1
in fact , even among @entity67 voters , raising taxes on the rich is more popular than cuts to @entity144 or @entity145 -- putting the leading @entity67 presidential candidates squarely out of touch even with their own base			1
the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results			0
we 've already drastically cut taxes for the rich and corporations , which has only made them richer while our economy remains in the gutter and no jobs are created			1
but in light of the depth and breadth of our economic crisis , continuing to put the interests of a few wealthy people and big corporations ahead of the needs of millions and millions of struggling and suffering @entity6 is n't just insane			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			1

number of poor highest in 50 years , @entity169 says , as the rich get super rich
@entity169 : 25 major corporations last year paid their ceos more than they paid in taxes
keeping taxes low for big business and rich does not create jobs , @entity169 writes
working families need the money , she says , to spend and stimulate economy
