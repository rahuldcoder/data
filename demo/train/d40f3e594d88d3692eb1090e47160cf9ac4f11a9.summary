-- the message sent by the military council that rules @entity3 was simple : " do n't mess with @entity3 's armed forces			1
" the message received by the activists who flooded @entity9 18 months ago : " @entity3 's revolution , which began with a bang , is ending with a whimper			1
" with several decrees , the @entity12 -- a body of 20 generals - moved to neuter civilian authority and give itself unprecedented powers			1
it got some help from the @entity19			2
the timing was hardly coincidental			2
the candidate of the @entity22 was running strongly in the final round of the presidential election against a former @entity27 @entity26 general			2
[ read more about the candidates ] what many observers are calling a " constitutional coup " has serious implications not only for the prospect of democracy in @entity3 , but also for the future of the @entity37 world and for the close relationship between @entity39 and @entity40			1
conflicting reports about whether @entity42 has died the drama began thursday , when the @entity19 ruled to expel one - third of the parliament entrusted with drafting a new constitution			2
the court held that the entire parliament , in which the @entity22 and allies have a majority , had to be disbanded			2
the court 's ruling was " absurd , destructive and essentially voids @entity3 's last year of politics of meaning , " @entity50 wrote in @entity55			1
the director of the @entity57 said the country was going through the " stupidest transition in history			2
" " with @entity3 looking ahead to no parliament , no constitution and a deeply divisive new president , it 's fair to say the experiment in military - led transition has come to its disappointing end , " @entity50 wrote			1
while @entity3 dealt with upheaval , its justice ministry ( part of the government appointed by the ruling military council ) extended the powers of military police and intelligence agents , allowing them to arrest civilians for a wide range of offenses , including protesting			1
late sunday , @entity27 had still gone ahead and voted in the presidential election			2
the @entity81 in @entity40 tweeted monday : " we congratulate @entity3 on this presidential race			1
it 's a historic event 4 democracy in @entity3			1
" hours later , the view from the @entity86 seemed different			2
" we are particularly concerned by decisions that appear to prolong the military 's hold on power , " said spokeswoman @entity87			1
meanwhile , the @entity12 announced that an appointed assembly would draft the constitution , replacing the assembly chosen by the elected parliament			2
the @entity12 also announced it would " decide all matters related to military affairs , " including the country 's defense budget			2
there would be no civilian oversight , they said			1
@entity27 already appeared to be losing faith in politics , with a low turnout in voting between the @entity22 's candidate , @entity107 , and @entity108 , who was @entity42 's last prime minister			2
now , whoever wins could discover the office of the president has much lesser authority than it did before			1
nobel laureate @entity115 , himself once a presidential contender , tweeted : " electing president in the absence of constitution and parliament is electing an ' emperor ' with more powers than deposed dictator			0
" @entity115 was once considered a sell - out by disappointed leaderless revolutionaries for not participating in this year 's presidential race			0
whatever their ultimate goal , @entity3 's traditional institutions are reasserting themselves in the face of an unpredictable political landscape			1
the @entity19 is afraid the @entity22 plans to reform the judicial system , said @entity132 , a senior fellow for @entity133 at the @entity134			0
@entity135 , a political science professor at @entity136 , agrees			0
" the @entity12 and the @entity19 have a similar outlook , regarding themselves as guardians of the @entity27 state -- with responsibilities above politics , " he said			0
" both felt threatened by the prospect of a @entity22 - dominated system			0
the @entity27 military has now become a state within a state , with oversight of the political system and the constitutional process , " @entity135 said			1
all four @entity27 presidents over the past 60 years have been former military men			0
the military and retired generals , like their counterparts in @entity155 , run important state enterprises , overseeing everything from food manufacturing to running hotel resorts			1
but what 's new and unusual in @entity3 is that the military had put itself beyond civilian control			1
it is " the locus of power , authority and legitimacy in the system , without having to run the country on a day - to - day basis , " @entity132 said			1
debate rages over whether this power grab was the military 's plan all along , or whether it has reacted to events			1
@entity176 , an analyst at the @entity177 , thinks it was the latter			0
" over the past several months , they saw that the political climate had shifted in their favor and consequently regained their confidence , " he said			0
" they knew the revolutionaries had lost support on the streets and were viewed negatively , so they seized the opportunity			0
" many @entity27 still feel the military is something to be proud of , a sentiment shared especially among the poor who are more concerned that @entity3 becomes stable and they can provide for their families			1
in the @entity196 rural governorate of @entity197 , home to many young people who have served in the military , factory worker @entity201 , 23 , praised the military			0
" the military and the people are still one hand , " he said			0
" the military alone can save @entity3 and make us one of the greatest countries in the world			1
" meanwhile , secular pro-democracy activists who took to @entity9 last year are wringing their hands			1
the very democratic structure they dreamed of appears to have withered in part because they developed no unifying ideology			0
they appeared to have no plan for a @entity3			1
they failed to get solidly behind a single presidential candidate , not least because several possible contenders were disqualified			0
@entity221 , a popular blogger who has journaled the revolution and goes by the name @entity223 , said the pro-democracy movement has itself to blame			0
" you successfully dethrone a tyrant , and you have neither plan nor vision on what to do afterwards , and no real understanding of the regime itself , " he posted			0
but he also criticized reformers who voted for the @entity22 's presidential candidate simply because he was not the " counter-revolutionary			0
" " our revolution called for a civil state : nonreligious , nonmilitary , and this guy will try to form a religious military state , " @entity221 wrote about @entity107			1
@entity132 said he believes that the @entity12 wo n't be swayed by reaction from the @entity242			0
the @entity242 gives $ 1.3 billion in annual aid to @entity3 , an amount second only to aid the @entity242 provides to @entity245			1
" the question is , does anyone in @entity40 care ? " he said			1
" the answer is yes and no. it is clear that the [ top military commander and de facto leader of @entity3 ] @entity252 [ @entity251 ] @entity250 and his colleagues are giving far more weight to their domestic interests than the potential consequences with the @entity242			1
" but a note from @entity242 defense secretary @entity263 to @entity250 to " ensure a full and peaceful transition to democracy " appears to have fallen on deaf ears			1
@entity132 wrote the recent book , " @entity265 : from @entity266 to @entity9 , " chronicling the influence of the military in @entity27 national politics			1
@entity132 said the level of aid has been static since the early 1980s			0
" historically , the military aid program was intended to help secure peace between @entity3 and @entity245 , establish an ally that could be an asset for military contingencies in the @entity277 and be a partner to prevent @entity280 penetration of the region , " he said			1
" now , we are basically paying for access to airspace and transit through the @entity286			0
" " now is n't the time to publicly threaten to end @entity242 aid , in the midst of an extremely volatile and fluid situation , " @entity50 said			0
" but it is the time to forcefully convey to the @entity12 privately that the transfer to civilian rule really does matter to the @entity242 " @entity294 , research director at the @entity295 , disagreed			1
" the @entity242 has to show that it 's on the side of @entity27 democracy and willing to stand up for it publicly , " he said			2
" frankly it has to undo damage			0
@entity301 's policy toward the @entity302 has been completely reactive			0
we wait until something disastrous happens when we should have anticipated it months ago			0
" the political chaos and an ever worsening economy appears to have induced a sense of resignation among @entity27			0
the turnout in sunday 's run - off vote and the prospect of the @entity22 joining forces with secular activists in defense of democracy seems remote			2
some secularists even take solace from the dissolution of the parliament , thinking they may do better in fresh elections			0
but that should n't be confused with stability , warns @entity50			0
if @entity108 is declared the victor , " he will preside over a country in economic collapse , with little prospect of restoring investor confidence any time soon			0
" @entity221 , aka @entity329 , said the pro-democracy movement must start over			0
" do something except running around from demonstration to march to sit - in , " he wrote			0
" real street work means that the street you live in knows you and trusts you , and will move with you , because you help them and care for them , not because you want to achieve some lofty notions you read about in a book			2
" but with a people more exhausted than incensed by 18 months of uncertainty , finding the determination for another uprising wo n't come easily			2
