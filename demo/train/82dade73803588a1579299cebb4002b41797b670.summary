released its latest " @entity3 and @entity4 " report			1
the document aims to provide a detailed overview of the main political , economic and social trends facing the region			1
alongside an economic analysis of the cost of the @entity13 conflict , the report found that many countries are still struggling to stabilize three years after the @entity15			1
however growth in other countries may be helping the region turn a corner			1
@entity0 's @entity19 sat down with the @entity1 's @entity3 and @entity21 director , @entity20 , to probe the report 's findings further and ask how we can expect the countries featured to develop in the near to medium term			1
he started by asking about the reports findings on growth in the region			1
@entity20 ( @entity33 ) : ( right now ) , many oil importing countries in the @entity3 and @entity32 are growing at between 2.5 % and 3.5 %			1
many of these countries were ( previously ) growing at 6 % and 7 %			1
@entity38 ( and ) @entity37 , if you go back to 2008 and 2009 were growing at those rates			1
how do we get back to those rates and how do we generate more jobs ? first of all , create a degree of more certainty for the private sector			2
the private sector right now is still holding back because of the transitions			0
that will work its way through in the next year or so			0
second , start embarking on some of the reforms that will improve the prospects for small and medium sized enterprises t come in			0
@entity19 ( @entity53 ) : people think , ' oh 2 to 3 % ( a decent rate of growth for developed countries ) and that 's with instability '			1
what do you need to get these economies on a more stable track ? @entity33 : the kind of growth you need to get these economies on a stable path is kind of in the neighborhood of 5 % and 6 % rather than 2 % or 3 %			1
why ? because that 's the level of growth that will create the jobs that an accruing number of young people that are coming into the labor market need			2
@entity53 : you mentioned youth unemployment , in most of these countries it 's 25 % or even more in @entity15 transition countries			2
@entity33 : youth unemployment has been chronically high in our region			2
but over the past three years because growth rates have slowed down , the number of young people without jobs has actually increased by 1.5 to 2 million people			2
that in itself means those young people are impatient for a job			0
but their presence serves sometimes as a deterrent for undertaking the reforms that will generate jobs for them			0
it 's easier to write checks , increase transfers or try to hire them on the public payroll but it 's not sustainable			0
@entity53 : the @entity13 spillover effect , most people do n't think of this in an economic context but you have			0
@entity33 : @entity13 at the moment is obviously a tragedy for the @entity13 people but more than that if you look at its neighbors , @entity109 , @entity110 and then to a lesser extent @entity112 and @entity113 , they 're all hosting @entity13 refugees			0
in the case of @entity109 and @entity110 , this is probably one percentage point or more of gdp in terms of impact already			0
beyond that , there 's regional trade that 's been affected , there 's tourism that 's been affected and then there 's the spread of uncertainty and conflict , sectarian tensions also spilling over across the borders			0
@entity53 : in your report you underline the inflationary threat			2
good news that @entity135 landed the @entity136 , @entity133 has the @entity137 but it could push up prices			0
@entity33 : you do see some signs of overheating in the short term in @entity133 , you do see increases in property prices , particularly real estate in @entity135 , and these are things to watch out for			0
( but ) overall , inflation rates in the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) , including in these two countries , remain quite manageable			1
these are , as you 've quite rightly pointed out , areas where you need to keep a vigilant eye .			0
