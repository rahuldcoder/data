-- @entity1 may fall later this week , but as far as former @entity4 astronaut @entity3 and other @entity6 enthusiasts are concerned , the real story is happening elsewhere			1
astronaut @entity3 , shown after his @entity9 mission in 1971 , claims there " is no doubt we are being visited			1
" @entity3 , who was part of the 1971 @entity15 moon mission , asserted monday that extraterrestrial life exists , and that the truth is being concealed by the @entity18 and other governments			1
he delivered his remarks during an appearance at the @entity22 following the conclusion of the fifth annual @entity24 , a meeting of @entity6 activists and researchers studying the possibility of alien life forms			1
@entity30 has long wondered if we 're " alone in the universe			2
[ but ] only in our period do we really have evidence			2
no , we 're not alone , " @entity3 said			1
" our destiny , in my opinion , and we might as well get started with it , is [ to ] become a part of the planetary community			2
... we should be ready to reach out beyond our planet and beyond our solar system to find out what is really going on out there			2
" @entity3 grew up in @entity42 , @entity43 , which some @entity6 believers maintain was the site of a @entity6 crash in 1947			1
he said residents of his hometown " had been hushed and told not to talk about their experience by military authorities			1
" they had been warned of " dire consequences " if they did so			2
but , he claimed , they " did n't want to go to the grave with their story			0
they wanted to tell somebody reliable			0
and being a local boy and having been to the moon , they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story			0
" roughly 10 years ago , @entity3 claimed , he was finally given an appointment at @entity67 to discuss what he had been told			1
an unnamed admiral working for the @entity70 promised to uncover the truth behind the @entity42 story , @entity3 said			1
the stories of a @entity6 crash " were confirmed , " but the admiral was then denied access when he " tried to get into the inner workings of that process			1
" the same admiral , @entity3 claimed , now denies the story			1
" i urge those who are doubtful : read the books , read the lore , start to understand what has really been going on			0
because there really is no doubt we are being visited , " he said			0
" the universe that we live in is much more wondrous , exciting , complex and far - reaching than we were ever able to know up to this point in time			0
" a @entity4 spokesman denied any cover - up			0
" @entity4 does not track ufos			0
@entity4 is not involved in any sort of cover - up about alien life on this planet or anywhere else -- period , " @entity94 said monday			0
debates have continued about what happened at @entity42			1
the @entity103 said in 1994 that wreckage recovered there in 1947 was most likely from a balloon - launched classified government project			0
@entity107 , head of the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) , which hosted the @entity110 , said that the truth about extraterrestrial life is being suppressed because it is politically explosive			0
" there is a third rail [ in @entity18 politics ] , and that is the @entity6 question			2
it is many magnitudes more radioactive than @entity120 ever dreamed to be , " @entity107 said .			0

he says governments are concealing evidence that extraterrestrials exist
the astronaut is from @entity42 , @entity43 , the site of an *alleged* @entity6 crash
