@entity11 , @entity12 : hi ! we 're launching a special edition of @entity0 this week			1
as the space shuttle program wraps up , we 're taking a look back - and a look forward - at @entity19 's space program			1
@entity20 @entity21 : the @entity22 has been launching shuttles for 30 years			2
they are the world 's first re-usable spacecraft			2
they launch like a rocket and land like a plane			0
@entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 : these five orbiters have launched more than 600 astronauts into space			0
this video you 're seeing right here highlights some of their achievements			0
over the course of 134 shuttle flights , these crews have logged millions of miles in space and carried thousands of tons of cargo			2
the space shuttle has served as @entity22 's main transport for crews and supplies to the international space station			1
shuttle crews have also repaired space equipment , like the @entity58			2
they 've launched new satellites , and they 've done experiments that ca n't be done on @entity62			0
when the shuttle was first announced , the idea was that shuttle launches would be cheap enough to happen every week			0
but it actually costs about half a billion dollars to launch a shuttle , and @entity19 only ever planned a few missions each year			1
so , what 's @entity19 's plans for the shuttles ' retirement ? each one of them will become an exhibit in museums across @entity22			1
so maybe one day , you might even get to go inside one			0
now , we 're going to hear from someone who not only gets to go inside a shuttle , he gets to fly in one too : the commander of @entity31 's latest mission , speaking a few weeks before the last scheduled mission			2
@entity84 , atlantis commander : i do n't think that the full magnitude of the moment will really hit us until the wheels have stopped on the runway			0
i 'm not sure words will really be able to capture -- for the crew and for the entire shuttle work force -- just how much the shuttle program has meant to us for the last 30 years			1
@entity95 @entity96 , @entity12 : time for the shoutout ! which constellation is named for a hunter in @entity101 mythology ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity108 , b ) @entity107 , c ) @entity110 or @entity111 ) @entity112 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity107 is the mythological hunter who can also be found in the stars			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity19 's next steps @entity21 : @entity107 is also the name of a new program at @entity19			1
it 's expected to be the replacement for the space shuttle program			1
americans could be headed back to the moon or into deep space toward @entity126			2
now , those missions are a long way off			0
part of the @entity107 program did go on the road recently though , and @entity133 reporter @entity132 got a chance to check it out			0
( begin video ) @entity136 , student : it flies into space and looks at stars or moons or other planets			0
@entity143 , @entity144 : @entity145 is talking about @entity107			0
this capsule , touted as the future of @entity19 , expected to one day carry man into deep space			1
@entity150 , @entity19 astronaut : what this vehicle will allow us to do is hopefully go beyond lower @entity62 orbit , on to the moon and hopefully to @entity126 , ultimately , is our goal			2
@entity158 : but 34 million miles from @entity126 , here on @entity62 , @entity107 is getting a lot of attention during this special stop in @entity163			0
@entity164 drove in from @entity165 , @entity166 to check it out before @entity107 is taken to its final destination at @entity4			0
@entity169 , @entity165 , @entity166 : i just like things that go on with the space program , and i just think it 's awesome			1
i just wanted to see the next thing that @entity19 was going to do , the next part of space explorations			1
@entity19 announcer : three ... two ... one ... launch ! @entity158 : the multi-purpose crew vehicle , as it 's called , will likely be in line to replace the shuttle program			1
@entity182 , @entity19 : we 're excited and very passionate about the work we do on this program , and we hope to launch our first orbital test flight as early as 2013 , so we 're ready to get on with the next program			1
@entity158 : while there 's still a lot of work to be done , according to @entity19 , this spacecraft should eventually be capable of sustaining a crew of up to six astronauts on deep space missions that could last anywhere from six days for a lunar fly - by , to up to 900 days for a @entity126 exploration mission			1
( @entity198 ) @entity199 @entity21 : there 's debate among scientists on this issue and we know you 've got some opinions on it , too			0
where should @entity22 go next ? to the moon ? trips to @entity126 ? somewhere else ? or should we just stay home ? send us your thoughts about the end of the shuttle program and the start of the next space program on our blog			1
you 'll find that at @entity221			0
goodbye @entity21 : before we go , the shuttle program may be on its last @entity35			1
and @entity19 's not likely to find the lost continent of @entity31			1
but that does n't mean the agency is n't going to be looking for its next @entity34			0
so , while @entity19 moves forward , we 'll leave you with a look back			2
we hope you 're enjoying your summer so far			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity229			2
