@entity0 is a professor of law at @entity1			1
she was a @entity2 fellow in 1980 - 81 , serving as special assistant to the attorney general and working on the nomination process of @entity6 , the first female @entity8 justice			1
she was also counsel to professor @entity9 during the @entity11 confirmation hearings in 1992			2
@entity0 says @entity13 's 350 judicial opinions are largely uncontroversial			1
( essence ) -- as judge @entity13 prepares to become the next @entity19 @entity8 justice , her lifetime of diligence and speed reading will now be crucial to help her navigate the next phase of her nomination			1
from here on out , she will be silent			0
we will not hear her voice again until she sits before the members of the @entity27			2
in the spring of 1981 , i was this @entity29 , a female law professor chosen to work as a @entity2 fellow assigned to @entity33 attorney general @entity32			2
i was one of three special assistants working directly on the search for the replacement to justice @entity37 , which led to justice @entity6 's nomination			1
i was responsible for preparing briefing books for attorney general @entity32 's chief of staff , @entity41 , before the @entity6 nomination was announced , so i know precisely what @entity13 will experience in the next 60 days			1
essence : @entity46 's @entity13 decision the judge will be working feverishly with a team of lawyers from the @entity50 , @entity51 , the @entity52 , and the @entity53			2
after her press conference with the president last week , more than likely she went straight to a briefing session in which she was given several thick briefing books , filled with memos that identify the most difficult questions of constitutional law that the members of the @entity27 are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing			1
essence : @entity46 's mentor weighs in on nomination the list of issues she will address will certainly include , but will not be limited to , questions about presidential power			0
the intense recent debate on the limits of presidential authorization for " enhanced interrogation techniques , " closing @entity74 , military commissions , and domestic wiretapping will surely produce a slew of questions			0
the lines of attack by outside interest groups are already beginning to take shape , but @entity13 's 350 judicial opinions are largely uncontroversial			1
so those who oppose her nomination will likely be forced to create a fusion between her personal story of educational mobility through affirmative action and her judicial views			0
they will try to take the president 's selection criterion of " empathy " and turn it against @entity13 as a sword to accuse her of being a race - and identity - sensitive ideologue			2
it helps considerably that her nomination comes at the beginning of the first term of a popular , media - savvy president			0
in this way , she is in the same position as @entity6 was when her nomination was announced in july 1981 , at the beginning of president @entity106 's first term			1
when i first saw @entity6 's résumé , before the nomination became public , i thought , there are too many gaps here			1
what did she do right after law school ? why had she never practiced law with a major law firm ? why had she chosen to be an elected politician ? the missing elements i was looking for were things that can not be captured in a résumé , like the fact that this brilliant woman was once prohibited from entering the practice of law , even though she graduated third in her class at @entity124			0
watch more what matters content her résumé did not include information on her own experience of exclusion and discrimination -- life experiences she would later call upon when it was time for her to cast the deciding vote against ending affirmative action in higher education in 2003			0
selecting a @entity8 justice is an art , not a science			0
this is n't just about checking a box			0
it 's a judgment call the president has made based on many things , including those personal experiences and a sense of chemistry between the president and the nominee			0
essence : blacks in the @entity2 the @entity13 hearings may give us a peek into her personal background			1
but the likelihood is that we wo n't really learn how her own experiences will have an impact on her legal reasoning as a justice			0
for now , we can only count on her diligent preparation to face partisan interest groups who will try to distort her identity and her record			1
prepare to see the future justice - in - the - making			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			2
