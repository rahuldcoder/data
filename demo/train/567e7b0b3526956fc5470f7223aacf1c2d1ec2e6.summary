-- conflicting reports about a shooting thursday at @entity4 's @entity3 -- including incorrect information that the suspect had been disarmed and apprehended -- were prevalent in the hours immediately after the incident , highlighting the confusion that initially reigned at the scene			1
by thursday evening , @entity11 police said they 'd determined that @entity12 , 50 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , shot a @entity16 doctor late thursday morning after becoming distraught over an update he had received about his mother 's medical condition			1
@entity12 then retreated to his mother 's room , where he fatally shot his mother and then himself , @entity11 police said			1
the doctor suffered non-life - threatening wounds and is expected to recover , according to police			1
but earlier , details about @entity12 ' name , how he died , and even whether he died -- at one point a hospital spokesman said he 'd been apprehended , when police said he had n't -- had been reported differently			1
people who heard about the incident during the first few hours may be surprised to learn how it turned out			0
a recap of the reports can help show how the information evolved			0

-- by 12:40 p.m. , a police spokesman had said authorities had no suspect in custody , disputing an account given by the hospital			1
a tactical unit was in the hospital , and the suspect was in a fixed location , police said			1
the police spokesman also said the wounded doctor , who earlier was listed in critical condition , had suffered non-life - threatening injuries and would recover			1
-- the hospital spokesman then clarified that the suspect had been " isolated , " and that he did n't know whether the suspect had been apprehended			2
-- by 12:45 p.m. , police had said the situation had been " contained , " and that only portions of the hospital had been evacuated -- which fit with the hospital 's explanation that some people were being asked to stay in their rooms			1
people outside the hospital , including employees who had left the building , were scared and confused			0
one worker told a local reporter that her mother , who also worked there , apparently was still inside , having been told to stay put			0

" my boss came running in to tell me to stay put where i am at , [ and that ] there 's a guy running around with a gun and we did n't know what he 's going to do , " @entity91 told @entity92 before 2 p.m. -- shortly after 1:30 p.m. , a police spokesman said for the first time that the suspect was inside a room with what they believed was a family member , and that the suspect was an @entity110 male in his mid- 30s			2
authorities were " still trying to gain control of the suspect , " though the situation was contained , he said			0

@entity121 , according to the commissioner , apparently had killed his mother and then shot himself			0
the incident began , the commissioner said , when the suspect became distraught while he was getting an update on his mother 's medical condition			2
he pulled a pistol out of his waistband , shot the doctor , and then retreated to his mother 's room , the commissioner said			2
-- by 5:20 p.m. , police said that the suspect had been using an alias , and that his real name was @entity12			0
police said they still believed that the slain woman , @entity140 , 84 , was @entity12 ' mother			0
by evening , police explained how they had found @entity12 : at about 1:30 p.m. , after nearly two and a half hours with no contact with the gunman , officers used a robot to peer into the room			0
