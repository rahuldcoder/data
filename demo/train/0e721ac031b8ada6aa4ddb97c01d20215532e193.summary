-- memo to all of the @entity3 apologists : stifle			1
this talented yet insufferable defensive back for the @entity5 is n't the 21st - century version of @entity7 , @entity8 or @entity9			2
so you should quit your hand - wringing , and between now and the @entity12 in a couple of weeks , you should remember that @entity3 put himself into this position of getting blasted in so many ways			1
mostly , when it comes to either screaming or whispering racism these days , you should find a more worthy cause			0
you should turn your attention to @entity24 , @entity25 , where authorities are claiming up is down , water is n't wet and a 17 - year - old black athlete suffocated to death after he " accidentally " rolled himself up in a wrestling mat at his high school			2
how about those ugly numbers involved with income inequality ? that affects people of color more than anybody			0
according to a study released this week from @entity41 humanitarian group @entity40 , the world 's richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 3 billion			0
and , goodness knows , most stop - and - frisk victims are darker than @entity45			0
as for this @entity3 thing , puhleeze			1
i mean , if you decide to look and sound like a crazy person on national television , you likely will receive a bunch of responses from yahoos that wo n't be kind			2
@entity3 : rant was ' immature , ' reaction ' mind - boggling ' those yahoos will view you as the yahoo			1
that 's not to excuse the use of racial epithets against @entity3			1
and to his credit , he apologized ( with a mighty push from @entity5 coach @entity64 ) for his rant on sunday after his @entity5 reached the @entity12 in the final seconds when he tipped away a potential game - winning pass to his arch - nemesis , @entity69 , a star wide receiver for the @entity70			1
@entity3 celebrated the moment by getting in a verbal spat with @entity69 , delivering the choke sign toward the 49ers bench and telling a @entity77 reporter on live television ... well , it was n't good			1
so here 's the bottom line surrounding all things @entity3 : nobody with a clue needs to watch his apologists flash frowns of concern before saying why they believe he is misunderstood			1
they say he really is an intelligent guy working on his masters at his undergraduate school of @entity91			0
they say he is doing much of his trash talking before the nearest camera , microphone or reporter 's notepad only for show			0
they say this is another example of why the rest of us just need to loosen up , because despite the way it appears ( you know , that @entity3 is absolutely out of control and needs a good spanking ) , he is being persecuted as a 25 - year - old black male with dreadlocks trying to keep it real			1
@entity3 's persona is dangerous , along with the shallow - thinking folks who support him and his ever - flapping tongue			1
here we are , 21 years after one of the most unfortunate commercials of all times , and many folks still have n't learned that @entity119 blew it			2
back then , when he was a player for the @entity121 instead of the analyst that he has become for @entity125 telecasts and other entities , @entity119 looked into a camera for @entity128 to deliver six infamous words : " i am not a role model			2
" well , there were lot of things wrong with that			0
for one , we all are role models -- regardless of intellect , occupation , age , creed , color , education , gender and social or economic status			1
whether we like it or not , somebody always is studying us			0
and the more visibility we have in life , especially when it comes to the fields of athletics and entertainment , the more responsibility we have to present ourselves in a way that will influence others for the positive			0
i know what @entity119 said he was trying to say			0
he said he was trying to say youth in general and black youth in particular should n't look at athletes as their role models			1
he was trying to say they should try to emulate their parents			0
sounds good , except as a person who has dealt up close and personal with black youngsters for decades around @entity164 -- ranging from speaking in elementary , junior high , high schools and colleges to teaching teenagers in @entity169 and leading youth groups -- many of them do n't have two parents			2
plus , according to statistics released by the @entity177 census in may , 68 % of black women who gave birth in the previous year were unmarried			0
not a lot of role modeling going on there			2
consider , too , that a large percentage of black youngsters raised by single women are latchkey kids , which means they come home to an empty dwelling to fend for themselves over long stretches of time			1
so many of those youngsters get their idea of how to survive and prosper from older folks in the neighborhood			0
either that , or they look toward the most visible people they see on television			0
actors , rappers , athletes			2
which is why @entity119 was a role model back then to millions , and which is why he remains one today -- whether he likes it or not			0
the same is true of @entity3			1
and on that score , he was a loser on sunday			0
so @entity3 deserved what he got in the aftermath			1
the youth watching it all deserved better , period			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

@entity213 : @entity3 deserved *criticism* for his rant about @entity69
do n't make @entity3 a civil *rights* hero ; he set a *bad* example for young fans , he says
@entity213 argues that the notion sports heroes are n't role models is way off
@entity213 : athletes can play *constructive* role to many kids raised without authority figures
