@entity0 , @entity1 -- as oil again again flows freely , crews are working around the clock to replace a containment cap on the ruptured underwater well in the @entity8 , @entity7 said saturday			1
the company hopes to install a better - fitting one in the coming days , @entity7 senior vice president @entity9 said			1
" we 're on plan , " he said hours after the old cap was removed			1
live video showed robots in the process of removing six bolts from the apparatus so that the new cap can be positioned			1
the bolts may all be removed by sunday			2
the old cap had been diverting about 15,000 barrels a day ( 630,000 gallons ) to a ship			2
@entity7 still is recovering an additional 8,000 to 9,000 barrels a day ( 336,000 to 378,000 gallons ) through a line connected to another vessel , the @entity25			1
@entity9 said the sealing cap operation is expected to take four to seven days , with favorable weather helping the process along			1
in upcoming weeks , there will be an increase in the current oil containment work			2
a fleet of skimmers will help recover the oil now making its way to the surface			0
" as we start to ramp up the additional containment capacity , we should see less and less flow , " @entity9 said			1
@entity9 said crews are in the final stages of hooking up the @entity42 , another oil recovery vessel , to the well			2
the vessel is expected to begin collecting oil by sunday and officials hope to reach full collection capacity of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels ( 840,000 to 1.5 million gallons ) per day within three days			1
" we 're in the final stages in doing the pressure testing " on the @entity42 , @entity9 said			0
if successful , the effects of the containment cap operation could halt the oil gusher that started april 20 after a deadly explosion on the @entity56 rig in the @entity8			1
officials have said such a fix would be temporary , and the permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well			0
there are two relief wells under construction , with one expected to be completed in august			0
one could intercept the leaking well as early as the end of july			0
over the next two to three weeks , 60,000 to 80,000 barrels ( 2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons ) a day should be contained , @entity9 said			0
scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily from @entity7 's breached @entity70 well			1
the company also says the sealing cap work " is intended to run in parallel with the installation and start - up of the @entity42			2
" @entity7 says there will be a period of decreased oil and gas capture from the wellhead during the cap replacement			1
it said another recovery vessel , the @entity25 , " should continue to capture and flare oil and gas			2
" there will be other recovery vessels and skimmers deployed			0
" this can be done very effectively , " @entity9 said			0
@entity9 also said there will be " significant measurement capability " added to the new cap so officials can get a good idea of the flow rate			2
@entity7 said in a statement that the new cap " should improve containment efficiency during hurricane season by allowing shorter disconnect and reconnect times			1
" @entity9 echoed much of what retired @entity101 adm. @entity100 said friday			0
@entity100 said he approved the cap - switch plan in order to take advantage of favorable weather predicted for coming days and because , once the switch is complete , the resulting capacity to contain oil " will be far greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems			1
" @entity100 stressed that once the capping device is on , " we would get the most accurate flow rate to date , " he said			0
meanwhile , @entity100 on saturday announced that rear adm. @entity115 is scheduled to relieve rear adm. @entity116 as the federal on - scene coordinator monday			0
@entity115 , who has been in the region for several weeks overseeing strategic planning , is the @entity101 's assistant commandant for marine safety , security and stewardship			0
@entity116 will return to his previous duties			0
@entity2 's @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report			0

new : replacement process is " on plan , " @entity7 official says
old containment cap removed from @entity8 well
switch will take 4 to 7 days during which oil will flow *unimpeded*
vessel may start *picking* up oil sunday
