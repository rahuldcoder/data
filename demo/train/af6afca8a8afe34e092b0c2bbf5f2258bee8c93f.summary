@entity0 , @entity1 -- as he stood before the delegates of the 1964 @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity9 sen. @entity8 , the party 's presidential nominee , said , " i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice			1
and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue			2
" the delegates , who had booed @entity23 gov. @entity22 when he called for the party to respect moderation , were thrilled			2
many of @entity8 's supporters were determined to push their party toward the right wing of the political spectrum			1
they felt that their party leaders , including president @entity31 , had simply offered a watered - down version of the @entity33			0
yet @entity8 soon learned that extremism could quickly become a political vice , particularly to a party seeking to regain control of the @entity38			1
the right wing of the @entity40 in the early 1960s inhabited a world that included extremist organizations , such as the @entity43 , that railed against communism			1
the @entity43 developed a huge network of local activists , reaching more than 100,000 members			0
they published pamphlets and books and threw their support behind local candidates			0
some mainstream conservative outlets depended on supporters who were in these groups			0
many right - wing organizations in the @entity57 were opponents of civil rights and advocates of racial segregation			0
during the fall campaign of 1964 , president @entity62 devastated @entity8 and his running mate , @entity64 , by painting them as an extremist duo with close ties to military hawks and racist demagogues			1
since @entity64 , a @entity23 congressman , was known for his close ties to the right , @entity70 could charge that @entity40 had not balanced their ticket			1
the " @entity75 " advertisement had @entity76 look into the eyeball of a young girl as it reflected the image of a nuclear explosion			0
another advertisement showed images of the @entity83 decked out in their garb and carrying burning crosses			0
the ads played on statements by the candidates and extremist organizations			0
the narrator of the @entity83 ad reminded viewers that @entity93 , grand dragon of the @entity83 , had said : " i like @entity8			1
" @entity70 certainly had their extremists as well in the 1960s , as all the discussions about @entity99 and the @entity100 in the 2008 campaign reminded us			1
yet in the 1960s , the @entity104 leadership was removed from these elements of the liberal spectrum			0
indeed , radical left - wing activists were primarily revolting against what they saw as the bankrupt leadership of the @entity70			1
they hated @entity62 even more than they hated @entity111			0
always nervous about being tagged by @entity40 in a conservative era as too close to socialism , @entity70 in @entity112 and in the @entity38 since the 1960s have tended to distance themselves from fringe elements of the left			1
now republicans are facing the danger of being associated with extremism once again			1
last week , following the vote on health care , members of @entity112 have were the targets of death threats and vandalism			1
in the final hours of the health care debate , there were reports about how health care opponents uttered racial slurs at @entity104 rep. @entity132 , a hero of the civil rights movement , and sexual epithets against rep. @entity136 , who is openly gay			1
@entity137 sent out a statement on @entity139 that urged followers , " @entity141 ! " @entity137 explained later that her use of those words was not about " inciting violence , " but rather about inspiring people to get involved in the political process			0
some ugly elements of the @entity149 movement , which have been held in check since the original @entity152 protest in september , have returned to the political debate			0
in the short - term , the @entity149 movement has helped to revitalize the @entity40			1
without question , the kind of energy that has been fostered by the activists associated with these groups has helped @entity40 mobilize their supporters and can clearly be helpful at bringing out the vote in the midterm elections			1
by generating interest in the libertarian and anti-government arguments of conservatism , the movement will help keep conservatives motivated after their loss on health care			1
it is fair to say that many @entity76 who support this cause are simply expressing legitimate and deeply held antipathies toward @entity152			0
but extremism is there , and it has flared in the past few weeks			2
this kind of rhetoric will not produce long - term gains for the @entity40			2
realizing the threat , @entity5 leaders have begun to disassociate themselves from these elements of the movement			0
there have been a few voices of condemnation , such as @entity38 minority leader @entity186 who said " violence and threats are unacceptable			0
" local @entity149 organizers have also stepped forward with words of condemnation			0
leaders from the @entity193 @entity149 said in a letter to president @entity195 that they stood in " stark opposition to any person using derogatory characterizations , threats of violence , or disparaging terms toward members of @entity112 or the president			0
" these statements are encouraging and strike the right note			0
yet @entity40 need to follow through by continuing to exert pressure on local organizational leaders to stamp out this kind of activity			2
they must also avoid contradictory messages , such as the statement of @entity212 @entity211 , who accused @entity70 of " fanning the flames " by using the incidents as a " political weapon			2
" @entity211 had a bullet fired at his campaign office after receiving anti-semitic threats , but local police described the bullet as random gunfire not directed at his office			0
the leadership statements must be unambiguous and firm , leaving no question in voters ' minds that this is not what conservatism is about			0
when @entity230 ran for the presidency in 1980 , he worked hard to weaken the connections that existed between @entity40 and the fringes			2
he learned the lessons of 1964 and sought to remake a @entity40 that could appeal to mainstream @entity76			1
@entity230 realized that if he did not , the perception of extremism would pose a long - term threat to the party 's future			1
now republicans are facing the @entity8 threat once again			1
at the same time that conservatives have every right to oppose and challenge president @entity195 's agenda , they must make clear that there are limits and that the kinds of actions that we have seen in recent days are not something that either party will be willing to tolerate in the year ahead			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			2

in 1964 , @entity8 said : " extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice . "
@entity40 's association with extremists hurt the @entity40 in that election , @entity254 says
he says extreme *reactions* to *passage* of health care bill pose danger for republicans
@entity254 says @entity70 have extreme fringe but have taken pains to dissociate from far left
