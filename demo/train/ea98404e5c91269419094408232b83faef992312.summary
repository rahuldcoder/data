-- @entity1 go to the polls in less than five weeks to vote in elections that will decide on policies as diverse as how the country polices its borders , how it manages its greenhouse emissions and how it plans to roll out a national scheme to connect every part of the vast continent to the @entity11			1
just weeks after ousting rival @entity12 , prime minister @entity13 on the weekend called a national election for september 7 , rallying the @entity16 faithful to stand behind the party 's policies on education and the economy			1
" we 've got one hell of a fight on our hands , " @entity13 said in an email to supporters			0
" i have a positive vision about the country we can be			0
in this election i 'll be talking with @entity1 across the county about better schools for our kids , investing so we can create good jobs , and about how the @entity34 ( national broadband network ) can help keep our economy strong			1
" so what 's at stake : 1			0
the asylum - seeker issue no area of policy is likely to be more contested , however , than border protection			1
an emotive issue that for decades has been fodder for @entity1 's strident brand of talk - back radio show hosts , known colloquially as ' shock - jocks ' , both the opposition @entity48 - @entity47 under @entity49 and @entity13 have policies that would effectively curtail the influx of ' boat people ' to @entity1			1
according to @entity1 's @entity55 , this year 218 boats carrying 15,182 passengers were listed as irregular maritime arrivals as of july , 2013 -- most of them refugees from @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 seeking asylum			1
@entity13 has put forward the @entity65 plan to deal with the influx , a $ a1.1 billion scheme that would settle asylum seekers outside @entity1 permanently			1
@entity49 , meanwhile , says he will turn the problem over to @entity1 's military which would be under orders to tow asylum - seeker boats to @entity73			1
@entity73 , however , has remained opposed to the opposition 's scheme			0
why @entity1 's @entity65 asylum plan wo n't work 2			2
tax and spending both parties , meanwhile , plan to axe the country 's controversial carbon tax on greenhouse emissions			0
uncertainty over the issue was credited with unseating @entity13 's first government and both parties have adopted fresh policies			0
under @entity13 , the government would move one year early to an emissions trading scheme while the @entity48 plans to scrap carbon trading altogether in favor of a voluntary emissions reduction scheme it has called ' direct action			0
' on the broader economic front , the government is likely to point to @entity1 's stellar economic figures which this year pegged growth at 2.5 % , a jobless rate of 5.7 % , inflation at just 2.4 % and interest rates also at a low 2.75 %			2
while @entity1 has seen a sustained boom , largely thanks to the sale of commodities to a resource - hungry @entity106 , the government has racked up a deficit of $ a30 billion and @entity49 -- a fiscal conservative - is certain to target government - spending in the lead - up to the election			2
how the @entity1 political rivals view @entity106 3			2
the internet the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , a contentious $ 40 billion program to connect more than 90 per cent of @entity1 's premises with super fast fiber optic cables , would be scaled back under a @entity48 - @entity47 government , which favors the use of existing , but slower , copper cable networks fed by fiber optic cables to the node			2
the @entity34 has proved highly popular in regions where the network has already been rolled out and some analysts say a perceived reversal of the policy could damage the @entity47 's chances at the polls			1
with little differentiating the parties substantively on policy , the role of the media in the lead - up to the elections will be crucial to the fortunes of both parties			1
already the right - leaning @entity140 newspaper -- @entity142 's largest - selling tabloid -- has called on readers to vote for the @entity47 running the headline : " @entity145 "			0
" the mass media no longer sees the explanations of policies and ideas as a central part of its charter , " analyst @entity146 of @entity147 told @entity149 website			0
" as it finds itself having to chase eyeballs in order to keep its financial head above water , it becomes more sensational , more attracted to portraying conflict and dealing with what public figures say rather than what they believe or do			0
" the parties go along with this model by ramping up the hyperbole			0

@entity1 will go to the polls on september 7
border protection and the economy set to be key issues
both parties likely to agree on education and national broadband policy
the media to play a strong role in what has proved to be a fickle electorate
