-- it was n't easy for 59 - year - old @entity2 to ask her husband , @entity3 , for a divorce after 37 years of marriage			1
" it really was the most courageous thing that i had to do , " she said			2
the couple met in college and married young			0
they settled down in a rambling , split - level house in the leafy suburbs of northern @entity12 and raised two sons , now grown			0
but they struggled over the years to communicate and connect , they say , and they slowly grew apart			1
when one son and his wife had a child , @entity2 spent more than eight months living in @entity20 helping out with the baby			1
it was during her time there that she realized how much she preferred living on her own			0
" we really did struggle , " she said			0
" we gave it our best shot			0
we were no strangers to marriage counseling , when it came to that , and individual counseling , but there just was n't the glue to hold it together anymore , for me			1
" it was always sort of lurking in the background there , " he said			0
" when @entity2 put it on the table it just seemed like , ok , yeah , we really should do this , and let 's try to do it right			1
" baby boomers looking for love online the @entity45 ' story is part of a larger trend			1
even as divorce rates for the general population have stabilized over the past several decades , they are on the rise among baby boomers			1
divorce rates among couples over 50 have doubled in the last 20 years , according to a study by @entity55			1
in 1990 , fewer than one in 10 people who divorced were 50 or older			1
in 2009 , that figure was one in four			0
using data from the federal government 's @entity60 , the study also looked at the demographics of divorce and found that rates for those over 50 were highest among black couples and lowest among white couples			1
hispanics fell in the middle			0
older adults who divorced also tended to be less educated than those who remained married			1
the authors identified several factors that could explain the rising rates , from longer life spans to the changing marital biographies of many baby boomers			1
they found the divorce rate for those who were in their second or third marriage was 2.5 times higher than for those in first marriages			1
" increasingly , these are baby boomers			1
they were the first generation to come of age when we saw the rapid acceleration in premarital cohabitation and divorce rates in the 1970s and the early 1980s , " said co-author @entity83			2
she also pointed to boomers ' changing ideas about marriage			1
" we have high expectations for what constitutes a good marriage today and we 're looking for self - fulfillment and individual happiness in our relationships , " @entity83 said			2
" when you are 60 , 65 you retire , ( and say ) ' well , i can live another 20 , 25 years			2
do i want to spend my life with that person ? is she or he making me happy ? ' and if not , well , divorce is a viable alternative			1
" @entity108 , now 62 , said members of his generation are used to getting what they want and that what many boomers want is changing now that they are entering a new phase of life			1
" there was a joke that one of the retirement counselors made at a seminar that i went through as part of my retirement planning , " he said			0
" the counselor said that couples will look at each other and say , ' well , i married you for life , but not for lunch			2
' that , ok , now you have all day looking at each other , trying to deal with each other			0
what do we do for lunch ? previously , you kind of went through your business day in your own world and you got together in the evening for family time , children time , relationship time			0
now you have deal with each other for all day long , and that 's different			0
and can you do it for another 20 years ? maybe not			2
" @entity143 : a divorced and separated persons support group doing it " right " while the @entity45 decided their marriage was over , that did n't mean their relationship was			1
@entity3 lives just a few miles away from @entity2 and still helps out with maintenance at the home they once shared			1
when @entity2 was in a minor car accident recently , @entity3 was the first person she called			1
" i feel like it 's worked out the best for both of us , because living together did n't work for us at all well , " @entity2 said			1
" we used to joke about how maybe if we had a duplex maybe we 'd get along better			0
but this is actually better			0
" both said part of the reason they have been able to maintain a positive relationship in the six months since their divorce was the way they went about the process			2
the @entity45 had a so - called " collaborative divorce			2
" each had his or her own lawyer , but they used a neutral financial planner and mental health professional to help them get through the process smoothly			1
collaborative divorces aim to avoid the traditional adversarial route of most divorces			0
and while a judge has to sign off on the agreement to make it official , the process is meant to avoid courtroom fights			0
" we worked it out			0
we wrote it down , " @entity3 explained			0
" the lawyers put the proper language on it , and we sent it to the court			0
it says , ' we 've already decided what we want to do with the rest of our lives			0
now please , your honor , sign			0
' " divorce over 50 raises important issues the rise in newly single boomers like the @entity45 raises important issues , from loneliness and financial concerns to dealing with failing health in their later years			1
" when these folks face health challenges , they are not going to have a spouse at the ready to provide for them , " @entity83 said			2
" traditionally in @entity213 , that is what we 've relied on			0
the no. 1 caregiver has been the spouse			0
" caregiving for loved ones the ' new normal ' for boomers the @entity45 both take precautions now that they are living alone			2
