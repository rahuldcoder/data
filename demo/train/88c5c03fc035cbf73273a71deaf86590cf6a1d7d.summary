-- images of repression and brutality against peaceful protesters demanding democracy and the elimination of corruption are not limited to @entity8			1
in our hemisphere , @entity9 are suffering at the hands of their own government			1
violence and systematic human rights abuses have resulted in 41 dead , hundreds injured , and thousands detained			1
these rights violations in @entity9 were chronicled this month by @entity16 in a 103 - page report , entitled " punished for protesting : @entity20 in @entity9 's @entity19 , and @entity21			1
" the study pulls back the veil of president @entity25 's administration and shows its willingness to go to dangerous extremes to silence political dissent			0
it depicts an unraveling situation in @entity9 far worse than suspected			1
the litany of rights violations is illustrated in graphic fashion : the unlawful use of force , violent mass arrests , crackdowns on free speech and press freedom , blanket denial of due process , and abuses in detention facilities , including electric shock torture			2
employing tactics perfected by the @entity47 regime , marauding @entity9 security forces are shown teaming up with armed gangs known as colectivos to beat unarmed demonstrators , firing live ammunition and tear gas canisters indiscriminately into crowds			1
in one instance , according to the report , a member of the @entity63 " stepped on ( a young protester 's ) head and fired rubber bullets at point - blank range in his thigh			0
the shot struck a set of keys in his pocket , dispersing metal shards as well as rubber pellets into his leg			0
" he was then taken to a military detention facility , denied medical treatment for hours , and lost so much blood that he was near death when finally permitted to see a doctor			0
while pro-democracy protesters are not fault - free in the use of violence , the primary responsibility for the horrifying , unjustified use of force rests with @entity25 and his band of apparatchiks			1
@entity9 's alleged socialist paradise has morphed into a verifiable real - life nightmare			1
at a time when many countries in the @entity91 are experiencing an economic ascent underpinned by growing middle classes , every indicator reveals that @entity9 is regressing at an alarming rate			2
frightening levels of criminal violence are coupled with economic freefall , punctuated by sky - high inflation and a scarcity of basic food items			0
in @entity9 today , the rule of law is abandoned , the judiciary is hollowed out , freedom of the press is nonexistent , and corruption runs rampant			1
drug traffickers collude regularly with government officials and the free flow of narcotics out of the country poses a threat to hemispheric security , as well as to the @entity113			0
last month , @entity25 pleaded in the @entity114 that " @entity9 needs peace and dialogue to move forward " -- but instead , he has delivered discord and suffering			2
with no alternative recourse against the crisis consuming their country , @entity9 citizens young and old have been turning out in mass demonstrations since early february			2
their courage has been met with repression , and the images flooding social media networks induce an outpouring of sympathy , mixed with terror and grief			0
attempts by @entity133 governments and the @entity134 to mediate talks between the @entity9 government and political opposition have collapsed and mass arrests continue			2
the @entity139 must take a forceful position and demand respect for human rights and democratic inclusion in @entity9			1
as chairman of the @entity148 , playing the role of a bystander to this chaos is unacceptable			0
my response to @entity25 - inspired mayhem is authoring bipartisan legislation imposing targeted sanctions on those individuals responsible for violating the rights of peaceful demonstrators			1
while designed to avoid hurting the @entity9 people , these hard - hitting penalties include asset freezes and visa bans for high - ranking members of the @entity25 administration who have terrorized large segments of the population with unflinching impunity			2
the legislation also authorizes $ 15 million to defend human rights , support democratic civil society , and strengthen the rule of law			1
the moment of action is upon us			0
on tuesday , the @entity148 will pass this legislation			0
as a nation of the @entity91 guided by principles of liberty and democracy , we are duty bound to respond when the light of freedom is threatened			0
# @entity180 is a constant refrain on social media networks , galvanizing international attention to the deteriorating situation in @entity9			2
the @entity185 hears your cries and stands in solidarity			0
join us on @entity190 / @entity189 .			0
