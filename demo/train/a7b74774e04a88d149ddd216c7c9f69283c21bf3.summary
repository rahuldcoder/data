-- tribal rivalries , an east - west divide , a rebel leadership lacking coherence , a shattered economy and the absence of a " civil society " -- these are just a few of the challenges that a @entity10 will face			1
the rebel @entity11 is aware of the perils ahead and has produced a blueprint for the immediate aftermath of @entity16 's downfall and for a political process leading to democratic elections			1
haunted by the lack of planning in @entity21 after the overthrow of @entity23 , the international community -- in the shape of the @entity26 -- has urged the @entity11 to pursue reconciliation			1
in a statement sunday night , president @entity28 called on the @entity11 to pursue " a transition to democracy that is just and inclusive for all of the people of @entity10			1
" but that is no simple formula in a society riven by deep - seated rivalries and with no experience of democracy			1
in 42 years as @entity40 leader , @entity16 purged @entity40 society of any alternative voice or real discourse			1
his revolutionary committees were ubiquitous , silencing dissent and enforcing the eccentric orthodoxy of the " brother leader 's " teachings			2
in such a warped society , there has been little space for the emergence of a professional , qualified middle - class , and none for trade unions , opposition groups or other symbols of civil society			1
the only organized group not tied to the regime was the @entity61 , driven underground by @entity16			1
as in @entity21 in 2003 or @entity63 now , there is no recognized opposition figure or group that transcends tribal , regional and sectarian rifts			2
@entity16 survived as long as he did , according to @entity40 scholar @entity67 , by breaking up the power bases of @entity10 's largest and most influential tribes			1
lands and influence were redistributed to more " dependable " tribes such as the @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
places like @entity16 's hometown -- @entity78 -- received more resources than those regarded as less loyal			1
but tribal loyalties have survived and perhaps become more important in the absence of other political institutions			2
@entity84 -- where the rebellion began and is still based -- has long been at odds with the west , @entity16 's power base			1
the pattern of the past six months ' conflict suggests that geographical divide persists			2
tribes in the west may not take kindly to the sudden dominance of a movement that began in the east			1
the rebel leadership in @entity98 has tried to co-ordinate with the rebellion in the west -- which began in the @entity100 and in some ways has been more effective on the battlefield -- but has not directed or controlled it			2
@entity10 is a vast country -- 1.75 million square kilometers - with many " under - governed " spaces , especially in the immense @entity104			2
in neighboring states such as @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , these are the spaces claimed by revolts and more recently by @entity112 groups professing allegiance to @entity114			0
@entity16 had his own problems with @entity117 extremism -- the @entity118 was one of the most effective groups sympathetic to @entity114 before its leaders turned against jihad in return for a mass release from @entity40 jails			1
towns in eastern @entity10 became well - known for supplying fighters to the insurgency in @entity21 , though the rebel leadership insists @entity16 has exaggerated the threat of @entity112 extremism for his own ends			1
then there is the resurgent @entity135 identity in the western mountains			0
@entity16 persecuted the @entity137 , a @entity138 minority -- even accusing them of being agents of the @entity141			1
but in the months since his forces have lost control of the @entity100 , the @entity137 have re-established their language ( @entity135 ) , their culture and even their flag			0
they are determined not to be subjugated again			0
the @entity147 issued a statement this weekend setting out the community 's demands : " @entity135 should be recognised in the @entity151 in all its dimensions ... this is a prerequisite of the @entity155 movement			2
" @entity10 's oil wealth has been a curse as well as a blessing			0
it has allowed lavish spending on education ( with thousands of students sent to universities overseas ) and infrastructure , and government subsidies have made staples affordable for millions			2
but there 's been virtually no diversification of the economy ; about 95 % of the @entity40 state 's revenues derive from hydrocarbons			1
unemployment probably exceeds 30 % and half the population is under the age of 15			0
the civil service is thought to employ about one in five @entity40			1
@entity16 built up a byzantine bureaucracy , but not one known for its efficiency			1
the adage among @entity40 is " @entity184 , moumken , " which means " with the will of @entity182 , tomorrow , maybe			1
" nor is there much entrepreneurial spirit			0
much of the hard work -- building railroads , servicing oil installations -- has been done by economic migrants and contract workers -- and hundreds of thousands of them fled when the fighting began			0
about 80 % of its people are literate ; electricity is connected to almost the whole country			0
economists say there are long - term opportunities -- @entity40 oil is plentiful and low in sulphur -- if new industries can be built and a work ethic encouraged			1
much also depends on whether opposition figures like @entity206 , who taught at the @entity207 and holds the economic and oil portfolio , are given authority			0
but the immediate priorities , according to western diplomats , center on basic services : electricity , food , water and above all security -- priorities that were ignored in @entity21			0
@entity220 foreign secretary @entity219 has urged the @entity11 to ensure that technocrats in the @entity40 government are not purged			1
@entity40 opposition officials envisage several thousand @entity225 troops -- possibly from the @entity226 and @entity227 -- being drafted into the capital to help stabilize what could be a chaotic situation			1
@entity23 's fall was followed by an orgy of looting in @entity233			0
how far the remnants of @entity16 's army and police can be integrated into new security forces is a huge open question			1
but a template drawn up by the @entity11 's envoy in the @entity226 , @entity240 , includes detailed plans for keeping police units in uniform			1
journalist @entity244 of the @entity245 , who has recently been in the western mountains , told @entity0 that he witnessed police training programs under way			0
the rebels seem to be aware that a new security force imposed from the east would be a recipe for trouble			2
much will depend on whether @entity16 loyalists begin a campaign of sabotage after he has gone , much as @entity23 's @entity257 did			2
there are also plans for an airlift of humanitarian supplies and the rapid rehabilitation of the oil infrastructure , though industry experts say it will be some time before pre-war exports of 1.6 million barrels a day can be attained			0
plans are one thing , but without an inclusive transition and transparency they will be quickly overwhelmed			0
for the more unscrupulous , there will be temptations to divert oil revenues to private accounts			0
the anti-corruption group @entity275 rates @entity10 146th in its corruption perception index , close to the bottom of the league			0
the @entity11 lacks cohesion -- a hastily devised group of former regime figures , intellectuals , nationalists , secularists and @entity117			2
it has also shown disunity to a murderous degree -- witness the murky circumstances of the killing of military chief @entity289 last month			0
but it 's now the only game in town and under its own transition plan will run @entity10 for the next eight months			0
even the @entity11 's chairman , @entity294 , has described this option as the " best of the worst			2
" any collapse of authority in @entity10 would have grim implications for its neighbors -- especially @entity300 and @entity301			0
@entity10 has been a source of work for millions of other @entity304			0
but chaos in @entity10 would also worry @entity306			0
it could become another route for the flow of drugs from @entity311			0
illegal immigration across the @entity313 is already taxing @entity314			0
and were @entity112 extremists , such as @entity317 , to gain a foothold , they would have ready access to @entity306 .			0

tribal rivalries , an east - west divide and a shattered economy are just a few of the challenges
@entity16 has purged @entity40 society of any alternative voice or real discourse
@entity332 government produces a blueprint for the immediate aftermath
the international community urges the @entity11 to pursue reconciliation
