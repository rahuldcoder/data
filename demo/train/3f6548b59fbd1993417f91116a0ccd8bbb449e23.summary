@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was a fiercely ambitious 25 - year - old with a masters degree -- but stuck in a dead end job			1
this is not how it was meant to be for a boy raised in @entity9 , nourished on the @entity10 that hard work and a good education would bring rewards and riches			0
so what did he do ? he left			0
after researching job vacancies abroad , an opportunity in reclusive @entity18 grabbed his attention			0
deciding his ambitions did n't stretch that far , @entity3 settled on a teaching job at @entity0 's @entity23 instead			0
" in the ( @entity26 ) @entity25 everyone is so mopey -- it is the @entity28 , no jobs , and income inequality is through the roof			1
we 're back to the gilded age in the @entity25 , " he said			2
fact check : @entity1 tire case i met @entity3 in the crowded @entity23 campus cafeteria			2
he 's had to get used to a lot in a short time			0
but he 's getting to grips with the language and can now order exotic new local food			0
" you could say it has been a long march , " he said			0
he is part of a new generation waking up to a new reality			0
@entity25 is no longer the land of opportunity			1
while people like @entity3 get it , @entity25 politicians seem bent on casting @entity1 as the bad guy			1
@entity0 is accused of keeping its currency low to win an export advantage and steal @entity25 jobs			1
the @entity1 bashing moved to center stage in the second @entity25 presidential debate			1
both candidates tried to score points against each other by getting tough on @entity1			1
" @entity1 has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years			1
and the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator , but refuses to do so			1
on day one , i will label @entity1 a currency manipulator , " proclaimed @entity66 @entity65			1
what questions were n't answered in the debate ? in response , president @entity70 , looking far more engaged than he did during the first debate , said @entity65 was the last person to get tough on @entity1 , accusing him of sending jobs to @entity74 during his business career			1
" governor @entity65 talked about @entity1 , as i already indicated			1
in the private sector , governor @entity65 's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing			2
that 's not my phrase			0
that 's what reporters called it , " @entity70 said			2
" and as far as currency manipulation , the currency has actually gone up 11 % since i 've been president because we have pushed them hard			2
and we 've put unprecedented trade pressure on @entity1			1
" that 's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency			0
that 's going to help to create jobs here			0
" after a softly - softly approach at the beginning of his administration , @entity70 has switched tack			2
he 's pivoted @entity25 geostrategic policy towards @entity74 after a decade of war in @entity101 and @entity102			2
while some countries express concern about the intentions of a more powerful and assertive @entity1 , the @entity25 is bolstering its relationships in the region			1
it is boosting its military presence by carrying out military exercises with allies @entity111 and @entity113 , while some @entity25 troops have been placed on @entity116 soil at a new base near the northern city of @entity119			2
many @entity1 watchers have couched this as an attempt to block the emerging super power 's rise			1
@entity1 's @entity125 has said @entity25 politicians need to treat @entity1 fairly and that in the interests of security the relationship needs to be based on trust			1
checking candidates ' facts on foreign policy ahead of a visit to @entity74 by @entity25 secretary of state @entity139 last month , an editorial in the state - run @entity1 @entity136 newspaper claimed " many @entity1 people dislike @entity139			1
" she has brought new and extremely profound mutual distrust between the mainstream societies of the two countries			0
" one of the sources of this hostility has been @entity147 's perceived interference in maritime disputes with @entity1 's neighbors in the region			2
during her recent visit , @entity151 urged those involved in the various territorial disputes to " begin to engage in a diplomatic process toward the shared goal of a code of conduct			0
" while @entity1 officials responded diplomatically by saying that " freedom of navigation and safety in the @entity164 is assured , " another editorial in the @entity136 was more scathing , saying it hoped @entity151 " can reflect upon the deep harm she is bringing to the @entity1 - @entity25 relationship in the last few months before she leaves office and try to make up for it			1
" for her part , @entity151 has stressed the importance of deepening bilateral ties			0
" as we continue to expand our work on the consequential issues of our time , we must continue to build on this historic opportunity to deepen our relationship , because a thriving @entity1 is good for @entity25 and a thriving @entity25 is good for @entity1 , " she said in a goodwill message to mark @entity1 's @entity176 on october 1			1
meanwhile , @entity3 is watching all of this unfold as he teaches his students about the @entity25 , the country he 's left behind			2
he says it is misguided to fear @entity1			0
" it 's not like going to the moon , like it might have been a hundred years ago because communication links us much closer together			0
" for him this is a new world , interdependent with @entity1 as a rapidly emerging new axis of power			0
and for people like he used to be -- back home and struggling -- he has some only half - joking advice			0
" get out , get out , leave everyone behind you			0
" global reaction to final debate : disappointment			0

@entity200 : @entity25 is no longer the land of opportunity -- @entity1 is
@entity65 , @entity70 attempt to score points in debate by bashing @entity1
@entity65 : " on day one i will label @entity1 a currency manipulator "
@entity70 : " we 've put unprecedented trade pressure on @entity1 "
