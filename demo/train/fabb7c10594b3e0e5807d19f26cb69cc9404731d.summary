-- in his first inaugural address in 1953 , newly elected president @entity1 told the @entity4 people , " history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid			1
we must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose			0
" this was a fitting and powerful response to the popular noninterventionism current of the 1950s from a five - star general who knew how to win a war			0
the first and most important job of the president is to be commander in chief			0
@entity1 knew that , as so did many of our great presidents			0
today , we are in danger of losing that founding virtue			0
president @entity27 's decision to order a full withdrawal of @entity4 troops from @entity30 by the end of the year will most likely lead to disaster			1
he greatly risks losing a country in which we have invested so much time , resources and , most importantly , human life			0
and he risks losing it to @entity38 , the world 's largest sponsor of terrorism and our primary enemy in a serious @entity44 proxy war			1
" the long war in @entity30 will come to an end by the end of this year , " @entity27 said friday			1
it may come to an end for our troops , but it is far from over for the people of @entity30			2
only very few of the loudest opponents of the @entity30 war advocated complete withdrawal			2
the @entity4 military commanders recommended at least 15,000 troops remain			1
@entity27 once again ignored his generals , as he did with @entity59 , and instead pressed ahead with a politically calculated decision			1
another view : " who lost @entity30 " is the wrong question perhaps this will gain him praise from the far left of his base , but this will not sit well with a vast majority of the @entity4 people			1
more than 4,000 @entity4 have died in the @entity30 war			2
the @entity4 people have been impatient with the war , but they know we were successful in @entity30			2
to throw this all away for political expediency is irresponsible			0
to be tired is one thing , to be irresolute is another			0
the frequent refrain of @entity75 was that he could always wait us out and that we would eventually show ourselves to be the weak horse , not the strong horse			0
and , @entity80 forbid , if we lose @entity30 , it will be on the shoulders of the commander in chief			2
under @entity27 's plan , a mere 160 @entity4 troops would stay in @entity30 to guard the @entity4 embassy			1
that is hardly enough troops to defend our own people			0
for comparison , the @entity4 has 1,234 troops in @entity91 , 1,894 troops in @entity92 and 678 troops in @entity94 , according to the @entity96 's active - duty military personnel records			2
we risk another @entity98 moment by evacuating @entity30 and leaving no support behind			2
on my radio show , " morning in @entity4 , " @entity100 , who is the @entity101 's @entity44 expert and teaches our troops at the @entity103 , said with no qualifications that he thinks we will lose @entity30 because of this			1
@entity108 , senior adviser and the chief spokesman for the @entity4 - led coalition in @entity30 in 2003 - 2004 , told me that the president 's decision shocked and perplexed him			1
@entity30 can not survive sectarian violence and @entity38 influence on its own , he added			1
@entity115 will surely move closer to @entity116 in our absence			0
indeed , one can already see the influence of @entity116			0
two weeks ago , @entity30 publicly defended the actions of @entity121 president @entity120 , an early and telling sign that @entity30 was preparing for the withdrawal of @entity4 forces			1
the @entity38 want influence in @entity30 ; @entity27 wants out of @entity30			1
the president defends his actions on the basis of his campaign pledge to withdraw all @entity4 troops from @entity30 and former president @entity132 's withdrawal timeline of 2011			1
however , just until last week , the @entity27 administration was negotiating the @entity134 with @entity136 's government with the understanding that several thousand troops would remain in @entity30 -- a clear break from his campaign pledge			1
more importantly , total troop withdrawal was never a platform of @entity132 's withdrawal timetable			1
we know that @entity116 is celebrating the president 's announcement			0
just weeks after spoiling an @entity38 plot to assassinate the @entity148 ambassador in @entity149 , the @entity4 will withdraw from its strongest post from which to engage @entity38			2
we have given them an open road to @entity115 and unfettered weapons supply lines to @entity121 and @entity154			0
by ceding @entity38 the high ground , the @entity27 administration has also undercut @entity4 and @entity157 efforts to shut down @entity38 's nuclear weapons program			1
in spite of all this , @entity27 will spend his re-election campaign trotting out his foreign policy accomplishments			0
he deserves credit where it is due			0
@entity75 , @entity165 and @entity166 are dead			0
but should we see the loss of @entity30 and the rise of @entity38 , all this will be for naught			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			0

@entity176 : president @entity27 's decision on troop withdrawal from @entity30 is wrong
he says it may gain him points with his base , but risks @entity30 falling under @entity38 's influence
@entity174 says @entity4 generals wanted at least 15,000 troops to remain
