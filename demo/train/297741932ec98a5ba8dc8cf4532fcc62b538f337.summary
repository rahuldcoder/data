he wanted to walk " somewhere warmer , " it said			1
@entity9 further told police he 'd ditched his @entity3 hat so no one would recognize him and " mentioned sleeping in treed areas and in bushes during his journey to @entity10 , " the statement said			1
@entity9 said he was tired , so police chaplains arranged a room for him , and police called his family to pick him up			2

he was not intoxicated , and he had no mental health issues , she said			0
" @entity9 is the best guy you could ask for			2
they do n't make them like @entity9 anymore , " said @entity68 , who met @entity9 through her boyfriend , who has known @entity9 for a decade			0
