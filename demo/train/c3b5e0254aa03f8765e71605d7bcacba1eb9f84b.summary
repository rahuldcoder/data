-- this was not how it was supposed to end			0
the past week had been a procession -- the next few days were supposed to end in a coronation			0
with the future @entity5 in the @entity6 , the man who wore the @entity8 crown so proudly allowed it to slip on @entity10			2
@entity11 , the first @entity12 man to win the tournament in 77 years , was not just thrown out of his court , he was brushed aside by a man threatening mutiny at the top of the men 's game			1
@entity20 has hinted at performances like this before -- but this was the announcement his potential had always promised to deliver			2
the @entity26 , 23 , for so long hailed as the heir apparent to 17 - time grand slam winner @entity28 , is ready to finally erase the tag which has haunted him since he first came to prominence -- that of " @entity20 "			1
ranked 13 in the world , @entity20 gave a performance which left nobody in doubt that he is a serious challenger for the title following a 6 - 1 7 - 6 6 - 2 win over the defending champion			1
never before has @entity20 gone further than the second round at the @entity41 -- now he is just one victory away from a grand slam final			2
but the signs had been there			0
@entity20 , who won the @entity47 title - a warm - up tournament before @entity8 - has been improving with each and every match			2
he will now play his first ever grand slam semifinal against @entity51 -- the 2011 champion and the tournament 's top seed			1
@entity51 , a six - time grand slam champion was given a real scare by @entity58 's @entity57 before eventually prevailing in five sets -- 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 2			1
also safely into the final four is the man who many have likened @entity20 to -- @entity28			1
the veteran of the @entity41 booked a ninth semifinal appearance after beating fellow @entity65 @entity64 3 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4			1
the @entity67 champion was seen by the doctor during the match and faded after a strong start as @entity28 's supreme ground strokes began to find their range			1
@entity28 , a seven - time @entity8 champion , said he was pleased to be in the mix after a disappointing 2013 tournament when he was beaten in the second round by @entity77 @entity76			1
" i 'm just really pleased i 'm back strong here at @entity8 , " he told reporters			0
" last year i did n't even come close so i was very deflated			0
" he will face @entity80 in the other semifinal , after the no. 8 seed from @entity83 disposed of @entity85 's conqueror , @entity86 , 6 - 7 6 - 2 6 - 4 7 - 6			1
@entity51 's game will be firmly tested against @entity20 -- a man playing with confidence , style and a whole lot of swagger			1
born in @entity93 , @entity26 , @entity20 trained at the same tennis academy in @entity95 as @entity11 , albeit not at the same time			1
the two are known to be friends off the court -- not that there was any sentimentality on show as @entity20 wielded his racquet like a magician holds his wand			2
he began at a rapid pace and never allowed @entity11 to find a foothold from which he could launch a fightback			2
" i 'm very disappointed with the way i started			0
i felt that gave him confidence at the beginning			0
it 's a lot easier to settle down when you 're two sets up , " @entity11 , the world no. 5 , told the @entity114			1
" it was n't a great day			0
i felt fine in the warm - up but got off to a bad start , which was the disappointing part			0
" it was n't good enough			0
there is time to come back , but i did n't take my opportunity in the second set			0
" he played a very solid match , making few mistakes and a lot of returns			0
all the percentages were in his favor			0
i just wish i 'd made it tougher for him			0
" a year ago , it was all so different			0
@entity11 , the man who had cried his way into the nation 's hearts after his 2012 final defeat by @entity28 , dispatched @entity51 in straight sets on to become the first @entity12 man to the win the singles title since @entity142 in 1936			1
if the first week of his defense was anything to go by , the expectation was that @entity11 would reach the semifinal stage at the very least			2
he had cruised through his opening four rounds without dropping a set -- a complete contrast to his opponent @entity20 , who had been forced to scrape and fight through a five - set contest in the third round with @entity77 's @entity153			1
as those with @entity12 flags painted on their faces and draped in the @entity157 took their places on @entity10 , a @entity11 defeat was perhaps the last thing on their minds -- somewhere between a shortage of strawberries and a drought of @entity167			1
but after sharing the two opening games , their hero failed -- spectacularly			0
@entity20 won five games in a row to take the first set in 25 minutes and leave those fervent fans in a state of shock			2
those who have followed @entity11 at @entity8 over the past few years are used to the rollercoaster nature of his campaigns			0
but that famous fighting spirit , that belligerence which makes his such a competitor , appeared to have deserted him			0
even in the second set where he immediately broke back to level at 4 - 4 after losing his serve , the belief that @entity11 would then go on and level the match never materialized			2
instead , it was @entity20 who held his nerve in the tiebreak , winning it 7 - 4 to take a stranglehold on the tie -- one which he never looked like relinquishing			1
showing little or no sign of being nervous or overawed by the occasion , @entity20 broke not just @entity11 's serve -- he broke his spirit			1
there was an inevitability about the result and @entity20 could celebrate when @entity11 placed his final shot into the net			1
it 's never easy coming to play against @entity11 , especially with the home crowd , " @entity20 told the @entity114			1
" as soon as we were warming up , i said his game was n't at the highest level , while at the same time i felt confident			0
the second - set tie - break was a key moment for me			0
" this was one of those days where i was pretty steady throughout the whole match			0
it 's a tough feeling when you know someone outside the court but then you come to play them in the match			0
" @entity20 will now go onto face either last year 's finalist @entity51 or @entity58 's @entity57 in the next round			1
for those who celebrated @entity11 's victory last year -- well , they 'll just be hoping they wo n't have to wait another 77 years for their next @entity8 party .			2
