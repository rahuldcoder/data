-- it 's hard to imagine a young child , strapped into a car seat under a baking sun , slowly succumbing to a hellish death			1
it 's even harder to imagine that it could have been anything other than a terrible accident			2
but that 's what police in @entity11 , @entity12 , say happened last week when 33 - year - old @entity14 left his 22 - month - old son , @entity15 , strapped into a car seat while he went to work			1
he 's been charged with felony murder and second - degree child cruelty			1
here are the key elements about this disturbing case : what happened ? on the morning of june 18 , @entity15 and his father stopped for breakfast at a @entity25 restaurant near his office in suburban @entity27			1
afterward , @entity15 put his son into the rear - facing car seat for the half - mile drive to the office			2
instead of taking @entity15 inside to the day care at his office , police say @entity15 left the boy strapped into his car seat and went inside to work			1
according to police , he came out and opened the driver side door and put something inside at lunchtime			0
he left the office at 4:16 p.m. , stopping a few miles later in a shopping center parking lot , where he called for help , screaming , " what have i done ? " how did @entity15 die ? although final autopsy reports are n't yet in , it appears he died the same way at least 619 other children have died since 1998 , according to a study by a @entity53 researcher : his body got too hot and there was n't anyone there to cool him down			1
it 's a condition called hyperthermia			2
" essentially what happens is that the body temperature gets so high that it begins to kill the cells , " forensic pathologist and former medical examiner @entity60 told @entity62			0
" it 's like you 're cooking something			0
" while hyperthermia can strike anyone with enough exposure to heat , babies and small children strapped into rear - facing car seats are at particular risk , if a parent or caregiver forgets they are there			0
on an 80 - degree day , a car can heat to an unsafe temperature in just two minutes , according to the @entity85 , and the temperature can rise to 123 degrees in just one hour			0
on the day @entity15 died , the temperature peaked at 88 degrees			1
so why is the father charged with murder ? police at first seemed sympathetic to what seemed like a tragic accident , but later said there was more to the case			1
" the chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation , " @entity11 police chief @entity94 said in a statement			0
a subsequent affidavit released by the @entity103 of @entity11 may indeed support the allegation			0
the document states that when investigators interviewed @entity114 , " he stated that he recently researched , through the @entity112 , child deaths inside vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for that to occur			1
@entity14 stated that he was fearful this could happen			2
" what are his family and friends saying ? @entity119 spoke in defense of her husband during @entity15 's funeral saturday in @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity114 ' hometown			1
@entity114 spoke as well , by phone from jail , thanking attendees " for everything you 've done for my boy			0
" the family has not answered questions from the media			0
neither has anyone close to the family			0
of the numerous family and friends of @entity15 contacted by @entity0 , none would speak			2
most said they had been advised not to			0
@entity15 's obituary says the boy was " loved and cherished and protected by both parents and all family members for his short 22 months of life			1
" and on a now - closed change.org petition calling on authorities to drop the charges , several posts from people who said they know @entity15 spoke well of him			1
" he has been nothing but a caring father and supporting husband , " wrote one poster , identified as @entity154 of @entity155 , @entity124			0
what 's next ? @entity114 is being held without bond at the @entity161 after pleading not guilty last week			0
he 's scheduled for a preliminary appearance on july 3			0
because he 's charged with murder , a grand jury will also have to review his case if the magistrate in an upcoming hearing finds probable cause for the charge to stand			2
police : @entity12 mom also searched @entity112 on child deaths @entity0 's @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			1
