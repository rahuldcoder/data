-- former @entity2 chairman @entity1 slams president @entity3 and today 's @entity4 , while calling @entity5 and @entity6 " the smartest presidents " he worked with , according to an advance copy of his upcoming book			1
president @entity3 , left , smiles with @entity1 after the longtime @entity2 chairman stepped down last year			1
he further says the @entity4 deserved the stomping it took in november 's congressional elections -- a ballot that saw both houses of @entity16 wrested from @entity4 control -- because the party " swapped principle for power			0
" his book , " @entity22 : adventures in a @entity25 , " is scheduled for release monday			0
@entity0 obtained a copy saturday			0
in the book , @entity1 wrote that @entity3 essentially left an unbridled @entity16 to spend money however it saw fit , and by not vetoing a single bill in six years , the president deprived the nation of checks and balances			1
" the @entity4 in @entity16 lost their way , " @entity1 wrote			1
" they swapped principle for power			0
they ended up with neither			0
" @entity1 , an 81 - year - old @entity4 who retired last year after five terms as @entity2 chairman , wrote that he made no secret of his view that @entity3 should reject some bills			1
" it would send a message to @entity16 that it did not have carte blanche on spending , " @entity1 recalls telling the administration			1
" but the answer i received from a senior @entity51 official was that the president did n't want to challenge house speaker @entity53			1
' he thinks he can control him better by not antagonizing him , ' the official said			0
" the @entity51 , however , said that vetoes were n't necessary because @entity16 " worked with us			1
" " the @entity57 stayed within the president 's top - line numbers on non-national security appropriations bills			2
we had veto threats , which were used to good effect to keep spending within the president 's numbers , " said spokesman @entity61			2
@entity1 wrote in his book that the decision was costly			2
" to my mind , " he wrote , " @entity3 's collaborate - do n't - confront approach was a major mistake -- it cost the nation a check - and - balance mechanism essential to fiscal discipline			1
" he further wrote that former treasury secretary @entity78 " found himself the odd man out ; much to my disappointment , economic policymaking in the @entity3 administration remained firmly in the hands of the @entity51 staff			1
" @entity61 countered that @entity78 and former treasury secretary @entity88 " had the opportunity to present their ideas through the policymaking process			2
if ideas failed to carry the day , it probably had something to do with the force and logic of the policies being advocated , rather than anything about the ' process			0
' ideas were considered , sometimes they achieved consensus , sometimes not -- nothing unusual there			0
at any rate , where we ended up on economic policy was right , as our records show			1
" " we 're not going to apologize for increased spending to protect our national security , " @entity61 said			0
" that is n't just increased spending			0
it 's an investment in the safety and security of the nation , which is also , by the way , an important economic objective			2
" @entity1 praised former president @entity6 and his attitude toward economic policies , saying , " either @entity6 shared many of my views on the way the economic system was evolving and on what should be done , or he was the cleverest chameleon i 'd ever encountered			1
" " @entity6 was often criticized for inconsistency and for a tendency to take all sides in a debate , but that was never true about his economic policy , " he wrote			1
" a consistent , disciplined focus on long - term economic growth became a hallmark of his presidency			0
" @entity1 said @entity6 and former president @entity5 were " by far the smartest presidents i 've worked with			1
" the former @entity2 chairman says his view of the @entity3 administration was not always so grim , and that he was initially excited about @entity3 's election			2
" i looked forward to at least four years of working collegially with many of the government 's best and brightest men , with whom i had shared many memorable experiences			0
and on a personal basis , that is how it worked out , " @entity1 wrote			2
" but on policy matters , i was soon to see my old friends veer off in unexpected directions			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
