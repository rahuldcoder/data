-- the @entity2 man who swam to @entity4 's home in @entity5 said thursday he still believes he did the right thing , even though his visit led to an extension of the pro-democracy leader 's house arrest			1
@entity11 told @entity4 he had a vision she would be murdered			1
@entity11 , 53 , swam across a lake to @entity4 's home in may and stayed for two days before authorities arrested him along with @entity4 and two of her staff			1

but @entity11 said he made the trip to @entity25 to save @entity4 from assassination , and that it was successful			1
what critics have described as a " stunt " brought enough attention to her plight , he said , to ensure that @entity4 could not be killed by the country 's ruling military junta			2
@entity11 said on @entity0 's " @entity35 " that he is " grateful that she 's alive , grateful that the entire world is watching and there 's no way these generals are ever going to try to assassinate her			2
" to many , however , his visit did more harm than good			0
some thought he might be mentally ill to attempt what he did -- an idea he rejects , though he says he can understand why people believe it			0
but @entity11 said he had no idea that @entity4 would be arrested and put on trial for something that he would do			1
" i wept every day and i 've suffered every day " because of the punishment she received , he told @entity0			0
he called her sentence " heartbreaking			0
" the case of @entity4 , a @entity56 laureate who has been the symbol of the country 's opposition for two decades , first came to @entity11 's attention when he was in @entity61 and saw her photograph			1
" i instantly had a premonition , or a vision , that i saw myself going through a lake and over a fence and was at a back door of a house , " he told @entity0			0
" then ( @entity70 ) googled from there and realized she lived next to @entity72 and i got a visa to get into @entity25			2
and i thought , since this has been presented to me , i 'm going to make this happen			0
" the retired bus driver and @entity78 veteran from @entity79 told his wife only that he had a premonition he would become a political prisoner in @entity5			2
she told her husband not to go , but he went anyway			0
in november 2008 , @entity11 said , he managed to swim across the lake and leave scriptures from the @entity86 for @entity4			1
but later he had a vision that @entity4 would be assassinated , so he decided to make another trip			2
that was the fateful trip on may 3			0
" the second time that i came was the same route , in through the sewer tunnel and into the water , " he said			0
" but this time of year the water level was much lower and i had two bags filled with a lot of stuff , and so i had to military - crawl with these two bags and i got caught			0
" fortunately , by the time they got close to me , i rolled over into the water with my bags which were tied together , and i literally was walking through the water and they were frightened			0
they , i do n't think , saw me -- they saw this bag floating through the water and moving at a consistent rate , so they started throwing rocks at it			0
and inside i prayed , ' what do i do ? ' and the only response that i felt , inspiration , was ' keep walking			0
' and that 's what i did			0
" @entity11 managed to reach @entity4 's house and was able to explain that he had a vision she would be murdered			1
he said @entity4 did n't think he was crazy , and she was " absolutely " happy to see him			2
@entity11 was arrested and convicted of violating immigration laws , municipal laws , and the conditions of @entity4 's house arrest			1
he was sentenced to seven years of hard labor , though he was freed this month after @entity2 sen. @entity126 traveled to @entity5 and intervened in his case			2
after his arrest , @entity11 said , he spent two and a half weeks under armed guard and was subject to interrogation at any hour of the day or night			2
@entity4 was initially sentenced to three years in prison after a military court found her guilty of violating her house arrest , but the head of the junta later commuted it to 18 months of home confinement			1
@entity4 's two housekeepers , who are her sole companions in her heavily guarded residence , also were sentenced to 18 months of house arrest to be served alongside @entity4			1
the opposition leader told the court she did n't know @entity11 , was unaware of his plans to visit , and did n't report his intrusion because she did n't want him to get in trouble			1
@entity11 insists he saved @entity4 's life			1
he said the ordeal has made him value the rights people have in the @entity2			0
" i 'm so grateful we live in a country where we have freedom of speech , and over there ( in @entity5 ) , where they speak the truth , they 're killed and imprisoned , " @entity11 told @entity0			1
