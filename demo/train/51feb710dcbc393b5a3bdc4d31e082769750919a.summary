-- @entity2 's government called for calm tuesday after heavy fighting between local militias around the @entity2 coastal city of @entity7 killed at least 17 people and wounded dozens more			1
the roughly 80 reported wounded filled @entity7 's hospital and included several civilians , said @entity11 , a spokesman for the city government			1
many of the wounded were severely hurt , and an appeal for blood donations went out on local radio			2
" the situation is terrible , " @entity11 told @entity0 as sporadi explosions and gunfire echoed in the background			0
" it is a real war now			0
" @entity11 called the violence the worst in that stretch of western @entity2 since the revolt that toppled longtime @entity2 strongman @entity26 in august			1
fighting broke out several days ago between factions from @entity7 , a largely berber city near the @entity31 border , and the nearby @entity33 - dominated towns of @entity34 and @entity35			1
the area has a history of ethnic enmity			0
most of tuesday 's deaths were in the outlying towns , but at least seven were reported dead in @entity7 , @entity11 said			1
@entity2 's @entity42 said it had dispatched a delegation of officials from @entity45 to seek an end to the fighting and a force of government troops to intervene and close off the area			1
" the council calls on all @entity2 , of all ethnicities , to preserve national unity and to exercise self - restraint , to rise above personal and insignificant differences and to not resort to weapons to resolve unresolved issues , " the @entity42 said in a statement issued tuesday evening			1
@entity2 authorities have been struggling to maintain peace in the country since the revolt that toppled @entity26 in august			1
weapons have flooded @entity2 's streets , and clashes have raged between rival groups -- including deadly tribal battles in the southern city of @entity69 that left nearly 150 people dead last week			1
the council said it would " work with all its power and strictly to pursue those who have caused these incidents that aim to destabilize the country			0
" the latest hostilities started when @entity7 fighters were among a group of more than 60 who were driving back home recently from the @entity31 border where they were posted , @entity11 said			2
they were intercepted by a large number of armed men , whom @entity11 described as @entity26 loyalists			2
he said some of the @entity7 militiamen managed to flee , but 25 others were captured and held for more than two days			2
@entity11 said the men were severely beaten and tortured by their captors , who called them " rats " and " @entity93 agents " -- terms that had been used by the @entity26 regime to describe rebel fighters			1
the @entity42 intervened and secured the release of the militiamen			2
but after they were freed , clashes broke out sunday			0
and that fighting intensified tuesday , as mortars and rockets rained down on the city			0
@entity11 said fighters from @entity7 were on the front line fighting back			2

civilian casualties include a mother and her two children whose home in @entity35 was shelled			0
but @entity11 said the people of @entity7 are " more than friends " with other @entity33 cities , like neighboring @entity112 , and blamed the tensions on discrimination by the people of @entity35 and @entity34			1
@entity11 complained about what he said were empty promises by the @entity45 government and the @entity42			0
for months , the government has been promising to disarm the areas surrounding @entity7 after previous incidents , but nothing was done			0
he said the people of @entity7 feel they have been abandoned because they are @entity125 , not @entity33			1
" our people are dying , and they are doing nothing , " @entity11 said			0
col. @entity128 , a @entity129 spokesman , told @entity0 a military committee met monday to resolve the situation around @entity7			0

if the situation escalates after peaceful intervention , @entity128 said , the national army could be deployed to stop the fighting			0
@entity137 said it was not clear what the cause of the fighting was			0
