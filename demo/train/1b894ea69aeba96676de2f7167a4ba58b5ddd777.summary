-- like the @entity2 was n't bad enough , now we have the story of @entity4 , the @entity5 analyst , who had an affair with a 22 - year - old coworker			1
unfortunately for the 46 - year - old sports dude and married father of four , his latest dalliance ( and apparently there 've been others before her ) turned bunny boiler when he broke it off with her			1
@entity15 , the jilted junior , allegedly went ballistic ; repeatedly emailing and calling @entity4 ' long - suffering wife , tricking their 16 - year - old son into an online flirtation , and then finally showing up at the family home , scaring the crap out of everyone			1
lucky for @entity15 , the @entity4 's declined to press charges , but her reputation , both professionally and personally , is shot			1
he 's since been fired from @entity5 and has entered a treatment facility			1
) obviously , being some cad 's side action is always a sucker 's game , but if you 're going to do it , do it right			1
the @entity0 : if he 's not on the market , shop elsewhere ! choose carefully it 's bad enough that you 're " dating " a married guy , but when you start sleeping with someone who 's in a position of authority over you , you 're screwing yourself twice			1
every good grade will be chalked up to your romance with the professor and every promotion , credited to time served on your back			0
do n't kid yourself that nobody in your class or office knows , because people are n't blind and you 're not that slick			0
do n't go home with him maybe he 's too cheap to pay for a hotel room , could be he secretly wants to get caught			1
then again , maybe he 's just a sociopath , but i ca n't even tell you how many times i 've heard about a marriage dude bringing his girlfriend back to the house he shares with his wife and kids -- usually when everyone 's out of town , but not always			2
@entity65 even took his mistress on vacation with his family ! whatever his motivation , resist			0
you 're already hurting this woman by having sex with her husband ; at least have the decency to stay out of the bed they share			2
the @entity0 : can couples get past infidelity ? accept that you 're no. 2 married guys will tell you a lot of things in their quest to bed you			2
that they have n't slept with their [ insert bitchy descriptor here ] wives for [ insert insanely long period of time here ] and that they 're only staying together for the [ kids / finances / etc. ]			0
you need to know going in that you will always come second			0
) sure , you might get expensive gifts , but you 'll also be spending nearly every holiday by your lonesome , you 'll never meet his friends , and plans will be canceled on a moment 's notice if something more important ( i.e. , anything ) comes up			2
the @entity0 : how to handle being the other woman you 're not his first			2
when an acquaintance of mine started an affair with a married coworker , she was furious when i suggested this might not be the first time he 'd strayed during his very long marriage			1
she screamed that i was a cynic and that their love was a special flower they alone shared			0
( on the conference room floor			0
) okay , she did n't use the term " special flower , " but that was the gist			0
a week later i got an embarrassed call back reporting that , contrary to what he 'd told her , he 'd been straying since his wedding day			0
a cheat and a liar -- who would 've guessed ? ! the @entity0 : 10 ways to punish a cheater ... and probably wo n't be his last most guys do n't leave their wives for the women they 're seeing on the side			1
yes , i know -- your grand passion is " different			0
but what if he actually does splinter the family into bits and make a ( semi ) honest woman out of you ? according to the web site , " @entity148 , " only 3 percent of men marry their affair partner and out of those , only 3 percent of those marriages last			1
and why would they ? you 're committing to a relationship that was built on lies and deceit			0
on second thought , maybe you want to rethink this whole " other woman " thing			2
the @entity0 : how do you define cheating ? @entity163 all rights reserved			0
