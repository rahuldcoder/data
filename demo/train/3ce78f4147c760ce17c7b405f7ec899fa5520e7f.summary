-- actor @entity1 is dedicated to improving the lives of young people around the world			1
the star of " @entity6 " works with the @entity7 , which supports educational initiatives for children in developing countries			1
he is also involved with @entity12 's program to deworm children in @entity14			1
@entity1 got to know @entity12 's founder , @entity15 , after @entity15 was honored as a @entity16 in 2007			1
@entity0 's @entity17 recently sat down with @entity1 to talk about @entity16 and his humanitarian work			1
below are excerpts from that interview			2
@entity17 : what inspired you to get involved with the @entity7 ? @entity1 : the founder of the @entity7 actually knew my dad for years , and the more i learned about it , the more i realized i really found the perfect charity			1
it sponsors schools and educational initiatives all over the planet			2
the thing that is really exciting is that it finds grass - roots educational initiatives that are already working , and the @entity7 comes in and says : " what do you need ? we want to help support you			1
we 'll raise money , and we 'll get you whatever you need			2
... you need a science lab ? you need a water fountain ? you need a soccer field ? you tell us what you need			2
we 're not going to come in and tell you what we think you should be having next			2
" it 's a really cool way of working , and i 've gotten to visit some of those schools			2
it 's a beautiful organization			0
@entity17 : why is this cause important to you ? @entity1 : i think that charity is a tricky thing , because a lot of times , people equate charity with handouts			1
i do n't believe in handouts			1
i do believe in education			1
and i do believe that the way to change a society , to uplift people -- not just their spirit , but to uplift their society and economic base -- is through education			1
that 's what @entity7 focuses on			1
it especially focuses on the education of women and girls			1
and i think that is key			0
... with young women and girls , they 're going to be ready to teach children ; they 're going to be ready to go back into their communities and share their knowledge with their children and with their communities			0
it 's vital that women and girls across the world have access to really good education			1
@entity17 : how did you get involved with @entity12 ? @entity1 : planting peace is a charity i got to know via @entity16			1
i was literally sitting in my trailer at " @entity6 , " and i was looking at the @entity0 website and it had @entity16			1
and i saw this story on this guy , @entity15			0
i read about him there , and i googled him and i did some more research , and i realized i stumbled upon a truly extraordinary human being			0
this is a young kid from @entity104 who grew up on a golf course			0
he went traveling in the @entity108 and he saw poverty , and he decided to devote his life to making the world a better place			1
planting peace works at this in a number of different ways			0
they support orphanages all over the world , but the other thing that @entity15 works on with a network of people is deworming			0
parasites really hold a society back			2
when kids have intestinal worms , they have less energy , they 're not able to focus , they 're not able to learn			0
( @entity15 ) has these pills he gets from the drug companies that are a penny and a half each , and it 'll deworm a kid for six months			0
and he has been working so hard , tirelessly , to deworm the children of @entity14			0
he 's handed out millions of these pills			0
@entity17 : what 's it like for you to see @entity12 's efforts in @entity14 ? @entity1 : i 've gotten to visit @entity15 several times down in @entity14			1
they have four or five orphanages in @entity14			0
i also went out when they distributed the deworming medication out in the rural villages and towns , and i got to meet a lot of people in their network			0
it was very heartwarming , it was very moving			0
they run an orphanage in @entity14 for hiv - positive children ; i think it 's the only orphanage of its kind in @entity14			0
they 're able to supply the meds that the kids need , they educate them , give them music classes			0
a lot of them are former street children , and they 're turning them into vital members of @entity14 society			2
it 's extraordinary seeing that first - hand			0
@entity17 : how did your experience with @entity16 evolve ? @entity1 : i think @entity16 is a great thing			1
i 've been to the ceremony a couple of times , and i always follow it			0
it 's incredible to see the amount of hard work and humility that these people have , uplifting the people around them			2
their stories are always the same : they 're a normal person , they 're doing a normal job , they 're no one special and they see a need			0
they 're like , " gosh , there 's street children here , " or " these sex workers are being used , " or " these veterans need a home , " or " this environment needs cleaning up , " whatever it is			0
and they do n't just complain about it			1
they actually just start to work very simply			2
and that 's what we need			0
i think we need about 6 or 7 billion @entity16 , and we 'll transform the world .			1

@entity1 is involved with two charities : the @entity7 and @entity12
he believes that education , not handouts , can change society for the better
@entity1 on @entity16 : they do n't complain , they just work on making a difference
