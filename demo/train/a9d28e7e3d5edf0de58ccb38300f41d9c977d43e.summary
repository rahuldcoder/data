the @entity0 and its allies are steeling themselves for what an @entity0 defense official described thursday as a yearslong fight against the so - called @entity6 , a revelation that came as airstrikes pummeled oil refineries in @entity9 used by the terror group to help fund its operations " i think we are in this for a matter of years , " @entity14 spokesman rear adm. @entity13 told @entity15 on thursday			1
" ... we are steeling ourselves for that period of time			0
" @entity0 - led airstrikes hit locations overnight in a remote area of eastern @entity9 where @entity23 has been using mobile refineries to produce oil that brings in up to $ 2 million a day for the group			1
the @entity0 military was still assessing the damage to the refineries by the airstrikes , @entity13 said			1
the attacks are focused on the " infrastructure around the refineries , " meaning the ability of @entity23 to produce oil , he said			1
even so , there are questions about just how much impact the destruction of the refineries will have on @entity23 , which analysts have said has access to billions of dollars			1
" even if we stop their oil flow today , they still have about a billion dollars in the bank , " retired @entity43 col. @entity42 said			0
" they seized about a third of a billion dollars from the central bank of @entity51 ( @entity52 )			0
" on top of that , he added , @entity23 has garnered millions of dollars in ransoms from @entity58 governments for hostages and have traded much of their oil			1
for now , the @entity0 is focused on the refineries , according to @entity13			1
but he acknowledged there are " other economic levers the international community is going to have to pull " to cut off all funding to @entity23			2
at least 14 militants and five civilians were killed in the overnight airstrikes , according to the @entity69 , a dissident monitoring group			0
@entity23 targets in @entity52 were also hit thursday morning by @entity73 's military , government spokesman @entity70 told reporters in @entity75			2
fighter jets carried out strikes on four @entity23 warehouses near @entity79 , which were believed to house military equipment			2
human rights lawyer executed the news came as reports surfaced that @entity23 fighters carried out a public execution of a well - known human rights lawyer , who took to @entity87 to criticize the group 's destruction of mosques , churches and shrines in @entity52			2
calling the torture and killing of @entity97 savage and cowardly , @entity96 special representative for @entity52 , @entity95 , said the @entity52 government and the international community must do all they can to ensure those responsible for her death are brought to justice			0
@entity104 was reportedly abducted from her home in @entity51 on september 17 and put on trial before a @entity109 court , which @entity95 says found her guilty of apostasy			0
" she was then held for a further five days during which she was subjected to torture in an attempt to force her to repent before she was executed in public , " he said			0
since august , @entity23 has beheaded @entity0 journalists @entity116 and @entity118 , and @entity120 aid worker @entity119 , gruesomely showing their killings in videos posted online			1
on thursday , fbi director @entity123 said that the @entity0 believes it has identified the @entity23 militant in the video showing @entity116 's killing			1
officials believe the same masked militant speaks in all three beheading videos			1
@entity123 did not identify the man			0
@entity23 overruns @entity52 base the reports about the execution came as new details emerged about the killing of up to 300 @entity52 soldiers in @entity52 's western @entity137 after @entity23 fighters overran the base near @entity79 this week			2
a handful of survivors who escaped from @entity141 , which had been under siege for a week , accused the @entity52 government of failing to respond to pleas for help in the days leading up to monday 's final @entity23 assault on the base			2
one soldier recounted in a video posted to @entity150 how he and his comrades battled the fighters for hours before starting to run out of ammunition and then being shot by a sniper			0
" i called the commander ... for support , but no one responded , " he said			0
while @entity15 can not confirm the authenticity of the claims in the video , @entity52 prime minister @entity158 has ordered an investigation into what happened and why the soldiers were left to fend for themselves			0
at least 113 soldiers were killed and another 78 are missing , according to @entity52 security officials			1
the report has raised questions about whether the @entity52 military can defeat @entity23 on the ground even with help from the @entity0 and its allies in the air			1
there are similar questions being asked about @entity9 's moderate rebel groups , which have been battling president @entity178 's forces and @entity23			1
@entity23 leadership dispersed ? @entity23 has likely dispersed much of its command - and - control capabilities in @entity9 , and leaders are now " mixed in with the civilian population , " @entity42 said			1
" so it 's unlikely these airstrikes have crippled @entity23 , " he said			2
" as the president has said , it 's going to be a long campaign , and it will be months -- perhaps years -- before @entity23 is dealt a serious blow absent any sort of ground force to go in and root them out on the ground			0
" in the latest round of strikes targeting @entity23 refineries in @entity9 , fighter jets from @entity194 and the @entity195 flew alongside @entity0 aircraft , hitting 12 locations , @entity13 said			1
while @entity23 has been the focus of most of the strikes in @entity9 , other terror targets have been hit			1
the @entity0 military said the @entity205 - linked @entity204 also was targeted when the strikes in @entity9 began tuesday morning			1
and the terror group @entity206 says its leader , @entity207 -- also known as " @entity208 " -- was killed			0
but the @entity0 has not said whether @entity207 is dead			2
" we can not confirm any particular leadership that might have been killed in any of these strikes , " @entity13 said wednesday			0
and as far as how many @entity23 militants have been killed , " we do n't know that , either , " @entity13 said			0
what 's the difference between @entity23 , @entity206 and the @entity204 ? international support while the support for the @entity0 - led airstrikes in @entity9 has been tepid , the support for the the international coalition against @entity23 in @entity52 is growing			1
the @entity222 foreign ministry announced wednesday that its military will contribute six @entity225 fighter jets and 250 troops to carry out airstrikes and train @entity52 and @entity229 forces			0
@entity231 foreign minister @entity230 said his country 's parliament will weigh a request for six of its fighter jets to take part in the bombing campaign			0
similarly , @entity120 prime minister @entity238 said he 's recalling @entity239 friday " to secure approval for the @entity120 to participate in the @entity52 air campaign			0
" the @entity244 has now received a clear request from the @entity52 government to support it in its military action against @entity23 , " @entity238 said from @entity96 headquarters in @entity243			2
" ... so it is right that @entity120 should move to a new phase of action			0

airstrikes focus on oil refineries , a source of revenue for @entity23
@entity0 thinks it has identified militant in beheading videos
113 soldiers are dead and 78 are missing following @entity23 attack , officials say
a military analyst and @entity9 resident say @entity23 is *infiltrating* the civilian population
