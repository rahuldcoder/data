-- for workers of @entity2 , the worst kind of tragedy imaginable struck last week when the @entity6 garment factory building -- just outside my home city of @entity9 -- collapsed , killing more than 500 workers			1
despite the many warnings of dangerous cracks in the walls reported to supervisors , police and the media earlier in the week , thousands were still sent to work on wednesday to proceed with business as usual			0
there 's no question that this building collapse is tragic , but for garment workers , it 's not surprising			1
i began working in @entity2 's garment industry at the age of 12 , making just $ 3 a month			1
i went to work because my father had a stroke and the family needed money to cover basic living expenses			2
i worked 23 days in a row , sleeping on the shop floor , taking showers in the factory restroom , drinking unsafe water and being slapped by the supervisor			1
@entity2 vs. the @entity38 : how much does it cost to make a denim shirt ? by the time i was a young woman working at a factory that made clothing for a big @entity38 retailer , i knew the time had come for change			1
the factory owed my coworkers and me overtime wages , but it wanted to pay us only half of what we had earned , making it even harder for us to support our families			1
so i helped lead a strike to hold our manager accountable			0
i was fired and blacklisted , but my work was far from over			0
i later learned labor law , @entity59 and computer skills so that i could help win justice for garment workers			2
today i lead a worker education and advocacy nonprofit that counts tens of thousands of garment workers as members			2
opinion : who really pays for our cheap clothes ? the sad reality is that tragedies like this have become business as usual , advanced by some of the most highly profitable @entity38 and international corporations in the world			0
last november , 112 workers lost their lives when the @entity80 factory , which produced garments sold by @entity82 , @entity83 and other retailers , caught fire			2
much like @entity88 's infamous triangle shirtwaist factory fire more than 100 years ago , the workers at @entity80 were trapped inside , with many jumping from upper story windows to try to save themselves			1
the death toll at @entity2 factories stands at nearly 1,000 since 2006 , based on estimates by the @entity2 government and an advocacy organization			1
in the case of these two recent tragedies , there is plenty of blame to go around -- from the @entity2 government for looking the other way at safety violations , to the incredibly dangerous circumstances workers face when they try to unionize , to the pressure factory owners and managers are under to turn out high product volume at low prices no matter what			1
it is the responsibility of the government of @entity2 to make a sustained , concerted effort to rectify the dire situation			2
strict , well - enforced factory codes and clear support for workers ' rights are paramount to protecting @entity2 's garment workforce			1
but more tragedies can be prevented only if the multinational corporations and retailers whose goods are produced at these factories are willing to stand up and do what is right			0
a coalition of labor and non-governmental organizations in @entity2 , @entity128 and the @entity38 has developed a protocol for an innovative two - year inspection and renovation program to finally make these factories safe -- the @entity132			2
in addition to facilitating government - supported employer - labor relations and stringent oversight of factory safety management , this protocol focuses on the responsibility of brand owners and retailers to support safety standards			2
if @entity82 and its fellow retailers that count on @entity2 labor demand change , we can be sure it will happen			1
as the protocol states , these corporations must verify that the factories they use comply with applicable safety standards			0
they must ensure that their pricing of garments makes it feasible for the factories to stick to standards			0
no longer should a @entity2 factory manager feel forced to pressure his employees to work in a deadly environment to meet a corporation 's bottom line			1
as for the tragedies that have already taken place , these brands should contribute to worker compensation funds for victims and victims ' families , including those in the fire at @entity80			0
to date , @entity82 and @entity83 have refused to contribute			0
both companies maintain that subcontractors had used the factory without their authorization , so they are not responsible			0
i single out @entity82 because its past actions have been painfully inadequate			0
@entity82 has refused to sign onto the protocol designed to enhance fire safety and improve factory structures , saying it is putting its own standards in place , which are perfectly adequate			0
yet those are @entity179 measures that are woefully insufficient			0
last fall , @entity82 refused to admit its connection to the @entity80 factory until my colleagues and i went there the day after the fire and photographed products with @entity82 's labels in the wreckage			0
we must no longer tolerate this willful ignorance on the part of multinational corporations about where their goods are produced			0
it 's high time that companies like @entity82 , @entity194 , and others step up and demand the safety of @entity2 's garment workers			1
too many @entity2 workers live and work in fear for their lives each day			1
the fire safety protocol is a critical first step to making real change , and i urge @entity82 to become a leader in the fight to save @entity2 lives			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity209 : deadly factory collapse in @entity2 was *inevitable* , considering conditions
@entity209 started work in @entity2 's garment industry at 12 , working 23 days in a row
@entity209 : 1,000 @entity2 workers have died since 2006 in factory fires or accidents
@entity209 : multinationals that *buy* cheap clothing need to demand safety and pay living wages
