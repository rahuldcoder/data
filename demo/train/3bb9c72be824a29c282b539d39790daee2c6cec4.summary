-- with @entity3 's " @entity2 , " we have the chance to see @entity5 begin once more			1
the much - hyped fall series made its debut on monday night , starting off with a storyline that 's pretty familiar to @entity5 fans and non-fans alike : the death of @entity5 's parents			1
" @entity2 's " take on the scene was more violent than usual , but it also added a new twist			1
a young @entity16 ( played by @entity17 , and destined to become @entity16 ) also witnessed the young couple being gunned down			2
monday 's premiere did give screen time to a young @entity5 ( @entity21 ) as he grieved the loss of his parents , but the future superhero is n't the real star of the show			1
that title belongs to detective @entity28 , who 's not yet a commissioner , as played by " @entity30 " and " @entity31 " star @entity32			0
@entity28 arrives in @entity33 because it 's where the action is , but he soon finds out that things are far more complicated			1
crime bosses @entity39 ( @entity40 ) and @entity41 run the city 's underworld , and @entity28 's partner , @entity44 , is n't exactly the most ethical cop around			0
but compared to @entity47 's straight - as - an - arrow @entity28 , the villains are so far the best part of " @entity2			1
" fish and her lackey @entity49 -- who 's also called by the nickname he hates , " @entity49 " -- were a treat to watch , as were the younger versions of @entity2 bad guys @entity56 and @entity57 during their very brief introductions			1
thus far , @entity47 's @entity28 seems like a one - note , righteous character , so we 'll have to see if he gets fleshed out in future episodes			2
for critics , " @entity2 " had a nice start but doubtful longevity			1
" taken strictly on its own terms , the @entity3 series is a handsome , gritty crime drama , with @entity32 as the idealistic young cop and @entity72 as his grizzled , ethically compromised partner , " @entity65 said in @entity67 's review			1
" yet if the show is supposed to work for its peripheral connection to the @entity77 and his colorful menagerie of villains before they became such ... well , that bat simply wo n't fly			2
" @entity82 at the @entity83 tried to focus on the positive , pointing out that at the very least , " @entity2 " has " consistent style			1
" " if you 're going to make yet another show or movie about an honest cop in a corrupt city , " @entity82 said , " you 'd better make it look good			0
( a ) nd this @entity33 , with its nightmarish gothic skyline under perpetually gray skies , looks pretty good			2
" viewers on @entity94 had mostly positive responses to the show -- and particularly its casting -- although not everyone was immediately sold			0
i was impressed because this is n't the type of show i would watch in the past , " said @entity100			0
added another fan , " i like the look and style			0
characters known and unknown seem interesting			0
we 'll see how it goes			0
" @entity113 , however , " was disappointed , " he tweeted			0
" good thing i follow a 3 episode rule			2
" what did you think of the premiere ? share your views in the comments .			0
