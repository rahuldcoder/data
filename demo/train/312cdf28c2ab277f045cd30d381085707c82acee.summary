-- a farm linked to the recent outbreak of cyclospora has stopped sending lettuce to the @entity5 , according to the @entity6			1
@entity8 " voluntarily suspended production and shipment of any salad mix , leafy green , or salad mix components from its operations in @entity15 , " the @entity6 website says			1
the company says it will not sell these products again until it receives @entity6 approval			1
as of monday , 539 people in 19 states have been sickened by cyclospora , a rare type of parasite that causes intestinal illness , according to the @entity25			1
at least 32 people have been hospitalized			2
the salad mix from @entity8 was linked specifically to cyclospora cases from @entity29 and @entity30			1
the @entity25 is not yet sure that all of the states ' cases are part of the same outbreak			1
@entity6 investigators traced the outbreak to four " illness clusters " of restaurants , which @entity6 spokeswoman @entity40 later identified to @entity0 as @entity42 and @entity43 locations			1
the probe did n't find indications that any bags of salad mix with the rare type of parasite were sold at @entity5 grocery stores			0
" nothing we have seen prior to this announcement gave us any reason to be concerned about the products we 've received from this supplier , " the restaurants ' parent company , @entity53 , said in a statement			2
@entity53 also insisted " it is completely safe to eat in our restaurants			2
" @entity8 has been cooperating with @entity5 officials , the @entity6 said , adding that tests will be conducted at the company 's processing facility in @entity15 " to try to learn the probable cause of the outbreak and identify preventive controls			1
" the last inspection there , in 2011 , turned up no notable problems , according to the federal agency			0
the company 's ceo , @entity73 , told @entity0 this month that its plant in @entity15 produced and distributed about 48 million servings of salads to thousands of restaurants in the @entity79 and @entity80 in june			1
" we have an extensive testing program in @entity15 to test water sources and raw product for coliforms , @entity86 , salmonella and listeria , " @entity73 said			2
" all our tests have been negative , and we have no evidence of cyclospora in our product			2
" as of wednesday , there had been 153 cases of cyclospora inspections reported in @entity29 , according to that state 's public health department			2
there have been 86 reported cases in @entity30			0
@entity100 currently has the most reported cases with 215 , according to the @entity25			1
authorities have not singled out a common source for the @entity100 's outbreak , which is largely centered in and around @entity105 and @entity106			0
despite the lack of a connection , a @entity105 woman sued @entity53 on friday -- soon after the @entity6 implicated the restaurant company -- " for all general , special , incidental and consequential damages " tied to her july 1 visit to an @entity43 in @entity113 , @entity100			1
@entity114 contends in her lawsuit that four days after eating spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad from @entity43 , she suffered severe intestinal issues			1
she says a clinic near her home took a stool sample and diagnosed her with a cyclospora infection			0
@entity114 says she 's still not feeling completely recovered			0
" i think i 'm getting better , but i still do n't have a lot of energy			0
i 'm worn out , " she told @entity0			0
while he was n't aware of the lawsuit until @entity0 alerted him , @entity53 spokesman @entity126 said his group 's restaurants in @entity100 have a different supplier than its restaurants in @entity29 and @entity30			0
@entity29 health authorities said last week that the prepackaged salad mix of iceberg and romaine lettuce , carrots and red cabbage was no longer in the state 's supply chain			0
" bagged salads and all other vegetables are safe to eat , " the state 's health department said			0
people get the disease by eating food or drinking water that 's been contaminated with feces from the parasite			2
the ailment -- which strikes in places where cyclospora is common such as tropical or subtropical regions but occasionally in the @entity5 as well -- causes symptoms such as diarrhea , weight loss and nausea that can last anywhere from a few days to more than a month			0
@entity0 's @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .			0
