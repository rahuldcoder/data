-- in a picture posted on @entity2 , a man in a white shirt holds his daughter in his arms			0
she holds an @entity8 flag			2
the caption reads : " @entity11 we will never bomb your country			2
" a response on the same page : an @entity11 tells the story of being forced to walk over an @entity8 flag every day when entering his school			1
years of being taught to hate the @entity8 flag had an effect , he says			2
but " after seeing your daughter holding the flag , i do not feel that way anymore , and i am so happy			0
now : i love that blue , i love that star , i love that flag			0
" the man in the white shirt is @entity8 graphic designer @entity29			2
with his wife , @entity29 , and their students at a small graphic design school , they 've started an internet meme			0
and slowly , but steadily , @entity8 are expressing their hopes for peace , and @entity11 are responding in kind			1
while it 's surprising and moving to see these unfamiliar images , it 's also tempting to dismiss @entity29 's project as the latest example of " slacktivism , " activism that 's as simple as a mouse click , with little or no effect in the real world			1
after all , it 's probably unrealistic to believe that @entity54 's " @entity53 " online campaign , viewed by more than one hundred million people on @entity57 , will bring a @entity51 warlord to justice			0
so it 's at least as unrealistic to believe that @entity8 and @entity11 leaders , both playing to their political bases with threats of war , will be swayed by these images			1
that casual dismissal may be too simple and too cynical			0
one of the more unexpected outcomes of @entity54 's campaign to bring @entity68 to justice was the response of @entity51 via social media			1
upset that the @entity53 video misrepresented the situation in her country , @entity51 blogger and journalist @entity77 posted her own video to @entity57			0
and 500,000 views later , she found herself appearing on @entity0 , explaining the importance of focusing on the path toward stability in northern @entity51 and not on arresting a single warlord			0
@entity77 felt that @entity54 did n't represent her voice and used social media to make herself heard			1
@entity29 , and the participants in @entity8 ♥ @entity11 , are making the point that their governments do n't speak on their behalf when they threaten war			1
through social media , they can challenge an official narrative and make clear that neither @entity8 nor @entity11 is a monolith			1
it 's worth noting that while most of the @entity8 images feature photos of people looking into the camera , few @entity11 images do			1
one features a black and white photo of an @entity11 diplomat who rescued 4,000 @entity106 jews from the @entity107			0
another showcases a @entity110 shrine in @entity11			0
@entity11 know that expressing solidarity with @entity8 online could lead to harassment or arrest and are finding ways to reach out -- often making clear that their sympathies are with " the @entity8 people " instead of the state of @entity8 -- without putting themselves at undue risk			2
will an effort like @entity8 ♥ @entity11 force either the @entity122 or @entity123 government to listen to the voices of dissenting citizens ? no. will it complicate the dialogue occurring in each country ? perhaps			1
it offers evidence that not all @entity8 citizens see @entity11 as an implacable enemy , and it replaces the faces of leaders with the faces of ordinary people			1
a path toward war for @entity8 involves seeing @entity123 as a madman ; a path toward peace starts with seeing @entity8 and @entity11 as real people			2
what do movements such as @entity8 ♥ @entity11 mean for governments and their diplomats ? it 's harder to speak for a nation when citizens of that nation can demand publicly to speak for themselves			1
corporations struggle to respond to customers who complain about poor service on their @entity2 pages and @entity156 feeds			0
nonprofit organizations such as invisible children find themselves confronting online criticism from the people they claim to represent			0
diplomats may find themselves one voice of many , complemented and contradicted by the voices of citizen diplomats such as @entity29 and @entity29			0
expecting a series of images on the @entity168 to change the path of the @entity8 - @entity11 relationship is too much weight to put onto a simple gesture			2
but it 's a worthy hope , and @entity8 ♥ @entity11 is a sign of things to come			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

@entity178 : @entity8 ' *facebook* page reaching out to @entity11 drew *big* response
he says it 's tempting to dismiss impact , but social media efforts produce unexpected outcomes
he says one effect is replacing faces of leaders in conflict with faces of ordinary human beings
@entity178 : social media lets citizens *bypass* leaders , speak for themselves
