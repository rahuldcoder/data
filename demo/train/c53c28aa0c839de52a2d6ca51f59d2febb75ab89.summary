-- you have a brain with billions of neurons			1
you have thoughts , and you do things because of those thoughts			0
but how do tiny cells translate into thoughts and actions ? the @entity11 initiative is seeking answers to that question			1
as described in a proposal published online thursday in the journal @entity18 , a group of prominent researchers is proposing a large - scale effort to create new tools to map the human brain in unprecedented detail			1
this could lead to treatments for brain disorders such as epilepsy , autism , dementia , depression and schizophrenia , as well as ways to restore movement in paralyzed patients			1
" we do n't actually understand ( how circuits of neurons ) generate all these interesting behaviors we have , like speech and language and thoughts and memory , " said @entity34 of @entity36 's department of neuroscience			2
" what we 're hoping is that as the tools develop -- and they will continue to develop -- we have additional insights that will lead to better medical devices			2
" @entity34 and his colleagues are eagerly waiting to see if the federal government will approve new money to pump into the project ; the recent spending cuts known as the sequester could affect that prospect			1
but the scientists ' proposal states that the project should be " funded by a partnership between federal and private organizations , " and they 're already beginning to ramp up their collective efforts , according to @entity63 , professor of genetics at @entity65 , who is one of the key minds behind the project			1
there are already indications of federal interest			0
president @entity74 , in his @entity72 in february , said , " if we want to make the best products , we also have to invest in the best ideas , " and alluded to scientists " mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to @entity80 's			1
" along with talking about drug development and materials science , @entity74 stated , " now is not the time to gut these job - creating investments in science and innovation			0
" fixing and manipulating the brain a big goal of the initiative is to create ways of stimulating neurons that are less invasive than what 's currently available , said @entity93			1
there is already research being done on brain implants			2
parkinson 's disease , for example , is being treated with deep brain stimulators , electrical devices in the brain that restimulate specific circuits of neurons that have become faulty			1
@entity34 is working on a project called @entity105 , where scientists are developing technologies to reconnect the brain to the body in patients with paralysis			1
researchers implant a small sensor -- about the size of a baby aspirin -- in the motor area of the brain			2
the sensor picks up a person 's thoughts about moving , and transforms brain signals into movement signals			1
through this technology , researchers have demonstrated that patients can move a computer cursor by thinking and manipulate a robotic arm as if it were their own			0
a next step will be to connect to the person 's own arm or -- if a person has an amputated limb -- to a prosthetic limb that they could control with thoughts			2
so far , the movements of the robotic arm do n't seem as natural , coordinated or quick as a real arm			0
that 's because scientists do not yet understand the precise brain processes involved			1
the @entity11 project could help , for instance , look at the neural connections involved in brushing teeth			1
" if we truly understand the code of how the brain does that , we could reproduce it , " @entity34 said			2
further into the future , if scientists better understand the neural bases of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia , it could be possible to also develop treatments by targeting groups of neurons with electrical impulses			1
" if you understood how thinking emerges from the interaction of many neurons , then you would have ideas about what a disordered thought would look like , " @entity34 said			0
another set of tools in the project that looks promising is called optogenetics			2
@entity167 of the @entity168 is well - known for this technique			0
it involves using proteins that are sensitive to light , derived from other organisms such as algae , and putting them into neurons			0
researchers can then use optic fibers to manipulate those neurons			0
high - density optical fiber arrays would offer more , and thinner , probes for neuronal exploration than bulky electrodes			0
" about a thousand groups are using these right now to study the brain because it lets you turn on one cell , or one kind of cell , and figure out what it does , " @entity167 said			1
" although we do n't have a complete list of the parts of the brain , we know that some cells are different than others , and people can turn on and off those cells to figure out how they work			2
" from worms to humans to cars the intention of the @entity11 project is to study the human brain , but there is also a lot of work going on in animal models , as they allow opportunities for testing devices before they are deemed safe for human trials			1
worms , flies and leeches are good invertebrate candidates , and zebra fish , mice and rats provide another level of depth			0
" within 5 years , it should be possible to monitor and / or to control tens of thousands of neurons , and by year 10 that number will increase at least 10-fold , " @entity34 and colleagues wrote in the @entity18 article			0
" by year 15 , observing 1 million neurons with markedly reduced invasiveness should be possible			0
" @entity34 anticipates that there will be insights that come out of the @entity11 project that go beyond the human brain			1
after all , as a result of the space program , we have gps			0
we have the web because a primitive version of it was developed at the @entity239 so that particle physicists could communicate better			0
how particle smasher and space telescopes relate in the case of this project , next - generation sensors that work in the brain could also be used to make cars smarter , @entity34 said			1
for instance , a car could automatically slow down if a soccer ball is detected in the road , anticipating that a child may dart out next			0
about that money ... researchers compare the economic benefits of brain mapping to the @entity257 , which generated $ 800 billion in economic impact as a result of a $ 3.8 billion investment , according to the @entity18 article			2
the genome project , for which @entity93 was a key leader , was another one of the " best ideas " @entity74 mentioned in his @entity72			2
the @entity257 started out in 1990 with $ 30 million in funding a year , and was ramped up to $ 300 million a year , @entity63 said			0
but @entity93 and his colleagues involved in the brain project have a vision that is akin to what happened after that project ended in 2003			1
between 2004 and 2011 , @entity93 said , there was a " million-fold " reduction in the cost of genome sequencing , and it 's still happening			0
" every person who does molecular biology now is a million times more effective because of the cost drop that came after the genome project was over , " he said			0
cost reduction of brain mapping is also a big aim of the @entity11 project			1
as technology gets better , it will also get cheaper , @entity93 said			0
" rather than have some monolithic juggernaut goal , where we 're compulsively going to get this neuron and this neuron and this neuron , i think it 's more , we want to enable all the creativity , and maybe even jostle the creativity a little bit , because people can dream different dreams , " he said .			0

@entity11 project wants to study brain in great detail
this could lead to treatments for paralysis , @entity305 's and other brain disorders
*budget* cuts may affect funding , but scientists are working with existing *resources*
