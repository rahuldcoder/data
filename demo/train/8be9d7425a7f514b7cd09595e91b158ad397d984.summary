a last - minute enrollment surge enabled the @entity1 to meet its original sign - up target for the @entity3 , a surprising victory for the @entity5 administration after a rocky rollout of the program that has become a political hot potato for @entity9 and a rallying cry for @entity11			1
president @entity5 said on tuesday that 7.1 million people had signed up on federal or state exchanges for coverage under the health care law now often known as @entity3			1
the enrollment period began anemically in october with a faltering federal website and ended with a crush of people trying to beat monday 's deadline to get coverage			1
not everyone who has selected a health plan has paid for it yet , officials said			0
nevertheless , @entity5 claimed victory at a @entity1 ceremony , saying the program approved by @entity31 in 2010 -- with no @entity11 support and vilified relentlessly by the @entity11 as government overreach -- has been a force for good			1
he said it was n't perfect , acknowledging the early difficulties in selecting a policy on @entity36 , and he predicted more hurdles in carrying it out			2
but the overall goal of starting to narrow the gap between those with health coverage and those without it has begun , and millions of @entity45 are embracing it , @entity5 said			1
" that 's what the ( law ) is all about , making sure all of us and all our fellow citizens can count on the security of health care when we get sick , " he said , noting that the " law is doing what it 's supposed to do			1
" the numbers the nonpartisan @entity58 originally projected the 7 million enrollment target for the october through march period , which was adopted by the administration			1
expectations plummeted throughout the fall and into this year after the early website problems , which @entity5 called " several lost weeks			2
" but signs of a pickup began in late january and continued into february and early march despite a fierce campaign by @entity11 to demonize the law as unworkable			0
administration officials said an absolute crush of people pushed the program -- @entity5 's chief domestic accomplishment -- over the finish line at the 11th hour			1
more than 4.8 million visits were made to @entity36 on monday alone			1
officials stressed that the 7.1 million figure represents only those who signed up for coverage			0
those who came in late and encountered technical problems have until mid-april to complete the process			0
private insurers are providing the coverage			0
health of human services secretary @entity84 told an @entity85 tv station on monday that insurers were reporting that 80 % to 90 % had paid so far			2
the law also includes expanded @entity89 insurance for the poor in many states , but those participants are not part of the sign - up total			1
the politics republicans , especially in the @entity1 , have waged a nonstop campaign to repeal or roll back the @entity3 , saying it was rammed through @entity31 without their input and now is another illustration of big government at its worst			0
they have made it a rallying cry of their fall campaign to expand their majority in the @entity1 and reclaim the @entity105			0
it has energized the base , and the issue informs the commentary of potential @entity11 candidates for president as well			0
@entity112 , a spokesman for @entity1 speaker @entity113 , an @entity114 @entity11 , said in a statement that the law " continues to harm the @entity45 people " despite @entity5 's " victory lap. " he said costs are not going down , as @entity5 contends , and people are losing insurance plans they preferred and small businesses are chafing under the law 's requirements			1
" that 's why we must replace this fundamentally flawed law with patient - centered solutions that will actually lower health care costs and help create jobs , " @entity112 said			1
democrats on the stump , especially those who voted for it and now find themselves in tight races , have recalibrated their position with @entity5 's presidency not much help to them with voters overall in their states			2
but @entity5 said at the @entity1 that the law is good for the country , regardless of politics , and that the numbers show @entity45 want it and that it 's " here to stay			2
" " i do n't get it			0
why are folks working so hard for people not to have health insurance ? why are they so mad about the idea of people having health insurance ? " he asked			2
what people think americans are divided over how they view the law			0
last month , 46 % said they viewed it unfavorably , down 4 points since january , and 38 % said they viewed it favorably , up 4 points over the same time period , according to a @entity163 poll			0
those who held unfavorable views cited concerns about costs ( 23 % ) , opposition to the individual mandate ( 17 % ) , and concerns about government intrusion ( 10 % )			0
those with favorable views cited expanded access to health care and health insurance ( 61 % ) , followed by the perception that it will control health care costs and make it more affordable ( 10 % ) and that it will be good for the country ( 7 % )			1
the telephone survey of 1,504 adults was conducted march 11 to 17 and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 points			0
professor @entity186 , a health economist at @entity187 , said he was not surprised at the last - minute rush to sign up			2
" i think the prayer of the conservatives that this would collapse just did n't get answered , " he told @entity189			2
" it fills a need			0
" he predicted conservatives would chip away at whatever the number proves to be			0
" it 's all just , some people hate @entity5 and anything he does , " he said			2
the details the administration did not release details about the numbers , including the number of younger @entity45 who signed up			2
that metric is crucial for making the program work economically because premiums from younger , healthier participants are needed to make the program work for older people who use the health care system more			1
an official briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity said insurance companies were confident the percentage of young people was sufficient for the insurance marketplaces to function properly			1
@entity3 's primary goal is to reduce the ranks of the 45 million uninsured			0
until now , many @entity45 with pre-existing conditions had to pay sky - high prices for insurance , if they could get any at all			0
often , insurers branded them " uninsurable			0
" the surge the administration pulled out all the stops in the final weeks of the enrollment period -- an effort one official equated to a " get out the vote " campaign before an election			1
administration officials took to the radio airwaves by participating in 400 interviews , enlisted celebrities and athletes to promote the law , and engaged people on social media			0
and @entity5 's interview on the online comedycast " @entity251 " resulted in the so - called @entity247 effect , resulting in 33 million views of his mock interview with the comedian			1
the interview with @entity247 , along with a promotional push from @entity255 forward @entity254 , were cited by administration officials as two of the most effective components in the push to enroll young @entity45 on the health care exchanges			1
the overall effort , the @entity1 said , surpassed their expectations in terms of last - minute sign - ups			1
by the numbers : the final @entity3 push @entity11 hit a nerve when it comes to @entity3 5 things the polls tell us about @entity3			0
