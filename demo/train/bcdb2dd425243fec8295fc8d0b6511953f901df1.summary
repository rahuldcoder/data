-- the constant battle for internet security saw another brazen attack this week as @entity5 hackers published millions of passwords they collected after hacking the professional - networking site @entity9			1
then , hours later , dating site @entity10 announced that a " small fraction " of its users -- others were saying 1.5 million -- were compromised by a similar attack			1
security professionals suspect the same hackers may have done it			1
" that 's what we think , " said @entity19 , a senior technology consultant with @entity20			2
" it was shared in the same places			0
the content is very similar			0
all of these factors just make it seem like too much to be a coincidence			0
" it 's enough to make some @entity33 users throw up their hands			0
if the sites we use on a daily basis ca n't keep our password data secure , how are we supposed to keep ourselves safe ? but security experts say there are still plenty of steps we can take ( even if too many people are n't following them )			1
how to check if your password was stolen password - management firm @entity47 has released a secure tool to see if your password was among the more than 6 million stolen from @entity9			2
@entity47 created a similar tool for people worried about the security of their @entity10 accounts			1
your password still matters even in cases such as the @entity9 breach , when it 's a website , not a personal account , that 's being hacked , the strength of your password can still help keep you safe			1
on sites such as @entity9 , stored passwords are " hashed , " meaning the site uses an algorithm to encode them			1
so , even if hackers get the data , they still have to unravel them before they 're useful			2
" do n't give up			0
do n't think this is all futile , " @entity19 said			0
" choose a long , hard - to - crack , unique password			0
not a sequence of numbers -- use something that basically looks like gobbledygook			0
those will be tougher for the bad guys to crack			0
" in the case of @entity9 , there are reports that as many as 60 % of the encrypted passwords stolen have been decoded , raising questions about the strength of its security system			1
be careful of post-hack e-mails when there 's a well - publicized security incident on a well - known website , online crooks are more than happy to pile on			2
in the wake of the @entity9 hack , security professionals were already reporting incidents of users receiving " phishing " attempts -- e-mails that look like official communications from @entity9			1
instead , these messages try to get users to reveal personal data that identity thieves could be use			2
or they include links that , when clicked on , can install malware on an unsuspecting user 's computer			0
" we are investigating the exact details but in the meantime please @entity115 on links in email to change or verify account information , at @entity9 or on any other membership site , " @entity110 of @entity109 wrote on the company 's blog			2
" instead , navigate to the site directly by typing in the address bar in your browser			0
" use different passwords for different sites @entity19 notes that the hackers who attacked @entity9 and @entity10 may not have even been interested in information from those sites			1
in many cases , they 'll be trying to use the passwords they find on other sites and accounts			2
many banks require additional information to log in			0
but accounts such as @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , for example , could be compromised if the user has one password across multiple sites			1
" if you get hacked in one place , you get hacked everywhere , " he said			0
lots of folks complain about how hard it is to remember multiple passwords			1
but there are free online tools that will store and use them for you			1
@entity19 mentioned several , including @entity157 , 1password and @entity47			0
@entity19 recommends those tools over letting your web browser store passwords for you , because there have been cases of security flaws in some browsers , which hackers have exploited to access user data .			1

hackers breach @entity9 , @entity10 sites , stealing millions of passwords
security experts say *tricky* passwords can still help thwart thieves
avoid " phishing " attacks in e-mails *disguised* to look official
free tools let you store multiple passwords for multiple sites
