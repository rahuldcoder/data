-- if you use mobile data services outside your wireless carrier 's network coverage area , you could get a nasty surprise in your bill			2
data - roaming charges can be outrageously expensive , even totaling thousands of dollars in a single month			1
also , carriers often do n't make it obvious to phone users when and where data - roaming fees might apply , or how fast they can add up			1
but that could be changing			0
at its december open meeting , the @entity14 may vote on a proposed rule that would mandate automatic data - roaming agreements between carriers and address consumer worries by requiring reasonable prices for this service			1
in april , the @entity14 ordered all wireless carriers to automatically allow voice calls to roam across networks			2
the data - roaming proposal would do the same for data traffic , i.e. mobile web surfing , running apps and other actions			1
the stakes here are much higher than just data - roaming charges			1
network neutrality -- the contentious principle that broadband providers should maintain equal web access to all and not offer favorable delivery speeds to certain clients -- may be at stake with this vote			0
recently , @entity43 's @entity42 explained : " the debate is the latest skirmish in the larger battle over broadband reclassification			0
to impose the rule , the @entity14 would need to change the legal framework that governs broadband services -- an idea pushed by net neutrality advocates but vehemently opposed by many @entity53 and internet providers			2
... enacting a data - roaming rule would be politically expedient for @entity14 chairman @entity56 , who has faced legal setbacks in his quest to make wireless networks more open			1
" the two largest @entity61 carriers -- @entity62 and @entity63 , which together serve over 60 percent of @entity61 mobile subscribers -- strenuously oppose this move			0
these carriers claim they already have negotiated dozens of data - roaming agreements with smaller carriers			1
according to @entity80 , " the arguments by the nation 's largest operators stand in stark contrast to filings by smaller wireless carriers , which argue the @entity14 should mandate automatic data roaming as it has already done with voice calling -- an effort intended to give smaller carriers a chance to compete against larger operators			1
" the carriers also have a more fundamental objection to the proposed data - roaming rule : they claim the @entity14 does not have the authority to regulate the data side of their business			1
taking the carriers ' side against the @entity14 in this fight are some powerful politicians -- most notably @entity94 congressman @entity93 , the ranking @entity53 on the @entity95 , @entity96 and the internet subcommittee			2
@entity98 may take over leadership of the powerful @entity100 when @entity53 gain control of the @entity95 in 2011			0
earlier this month , when rumors began circulating that the @entity14 might move to vote on data roaming , @entity98 issued a a statement opposing the vote			2
" ramming through internet regulations would ignore the will of a bipartisan majority of @entity110 and the @entity61 public , " he said			0
" it would further impede economic growth and job creation			0
" the @entity14 sidestepped this vote in the agenda for its november 30 open meeting			0
without explanation , the agency last week announced it will delay its december meeting by a few days , until december 21			0
the agenda for the december @entity14 open meeting has not yet been published			0
if a vote on the data - roaming proposal appears on that agenda , the @entity14 might be able to get this rule approved under the wire , increasing its ability to pursue its net neutrality plans , before a more hostile @entity110 moves in .			1

the @entity14 may be prepared to vote on a proposed rule that could limit wireless data - roaming charges
the rule would mandate automatic data - roaming agreements between carriers
it would also address consumer worries by requiring reasonable prices for this service
