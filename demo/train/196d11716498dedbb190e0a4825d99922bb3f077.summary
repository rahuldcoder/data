-- @entity2 's economic success has created a fast - growing middle class and an explosion in domestic travel			1
cashing in on the travel boom is one hotel chain that 's expanding so fast , it 's opening a new property every two days			1
budget hotel chain @entity10 was founded by billionaire businessman @entity11 seven years ago			1
today it has 1,000 properties in @entity2 , across four brands , and @entity11 expects @entity15 to be the world 's biggest hotel chain by 2020			1
the company takes inspiration from @entity21 low - cost hotel chains that cater for frequent business travelers on a budget , such as @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
" i first got the idea from a book introducing @entity24 , about how they open small hotels with less expensive but cozy , clean rooms , " @entity11 told @entity0 's @entity27			0
" i realized there 's a gap in the @entity2 market for such hotels as well so i decided to invest experimentally in that niche			1
" see also : @entity2 's unique boutique hotels @entity11 identifies three things that @entity2 customers look for in a hotel room -- all of which will chime with @entity21 travelers : a soft bed , free internet access and a good hot shower after a long , tiring day			1
he says his ultimate target is to open 10,000 hotels			0
his big draw is clean , no - frills rooms that start from as little as $ 15 a night			0
" we only invest in crucial parts ( of the hotels )			0
in our lobby you do n't see fancy decorations like marble surface or crystal lights , " said @entity11			0
" we keep everything simple because our clients do n't really pay much attention to that			0
but we put serious money into our rooms -- in that way we manage to keep our hotels cost - effective			0
" the sheer scale and speed of economic development within @entity2 over the last 20 years has forced hoteliers the world over to sit up and take notice			1
the number of @entity2 people traveling outside @entity2 has risen to 65 million a year , overtaking @entity75 as the largest source of outbound travelers in @entity78			2

@entity96 , brand president at @entity90 , told @entity97 that @entity92 offers services including @entity2 foods on the breakfast menu , and guest rooms that come with green tea , slippers , and @entity2 tv channels			2
" we wanted to create a program that made them feel comfortable and welcome when going outside their country for the first time , " he said			0
but international players are also moving into @entity2			1
@entity24 has tried to gain a foothold in the @entity2 market with its @entity114 brand , known locally as @entity114 , and @entity86 plans to more than double the number of its hotels in @entity2 in the next three years			2
" we 've got to make sure that we are succeeding with the @entity2 traveler and winning their loyalty , " said @entity86 ceo @entity117			2
" the loyalty that we build here can get translated ultimately to loyalty of @entity2 travelers going around the globe			0
" see also : 55 years of @entity86 hotels but @entity11 believes that foreign competitors will find it hard to compete with @entity15 on its home turf			0
we are more cost - effective			0
we know our clients better , " he said			0
@entity11 says he welcomes international customers , but currently 90 % of @entity135 guests are @entity2 business travelers			1
and with 1.3 billion @entity2 people , whose average incomes have quadrupled in the last four years , it 's small wonder that for the time being , @entity15 is concentrating on the local market .			2
