-- " @entity1 " has flown the coop			1
the addictive game that soared to the top of @entity5 and @entity7 app downloads disappeared from app stores on sunday , though players who already have it apparently can keep on flying			1
a tweet from the game 's creator suggested that its sudden success had become an albatross			1
" i am sorry ' @entity1 ' users , 22 hours from now , i will take ' @entity1 ' down , " developer @entity1 wrote on saturday			1
" i can not take this anymore			0
" @entity19 , a @entity20 developer with a studio called @entity22 , did not reply to @entity0 's request for an interview last week and has stayed mostly quiet in the wake of the game 's recent and sudden success			1
he gave an interview monday to @entity29 in which he said the game was conceived as a fun way to kill a few minutes but became " an addictive product			2
i think it has become a problem			0
" the game , he added , is " gone forever			0
" " @entity1 " gives players a chance to steer a tiny bird through a difficult obstacle course of metal pipes			2
but it 's unclear why it shot to the top of the most downloaded charts			2
although new players can no longer download " @entity1 , " the game remains playable for those who had already added it to their devices			1
hundreds of phones with " @entity1 " installed have suddenly appeared for sale on @entity51 at hugely inflated prices			2
" @entity1 " was originally released for the @entity5 in may but did n't become the top free @entity5 app until mid-january , following a surge in popularity that seems to have kicked off in early december			1
observers have voiced several unproven theories about the game 's sudden success , including the use of bots to get it on top 10 lists artificially , organic enthusiasm on social media and a surge in amusing user reviews in the @entity68 and @entity69 stores			1
@entity19 told @entity70 he created the game in two to three days and says he did not promote the app in any way after its release			0
in a series of @entity77 posts saturday , he said he would n't sell " @entity1 " and would continue to make games			2
" it is not anything related to legal issues , " he said			0
" i just can not keep it anymore			0
" last week , " @entity1 " had an average four - star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the @entity85 and 228,000 on @entity7			0
many of the reviews were lengthy , tongue - in - cheek tales of time lost , marriages ended and people going cuckoo after playing the game			0
@entity0 's @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 contributed to this report .			0

' @entity1 ' is no longer available in app stores
the addictive game soared to the top of downloads
