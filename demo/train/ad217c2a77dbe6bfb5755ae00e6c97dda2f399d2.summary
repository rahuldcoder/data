-- watching 3 - d movies generally means suffering through two things : crappy plotlines that favor spectacle over substance and the need to wear some annoying , dorky glasses			1
scientists may have solved one of these frustrations			0
( you might be able to guess which			0
) researchers in @entity13 have created a new method that would allow moviegoers to simply sit down and start watching a 3 - d movie with no extra gear necessary			1
the research was published monday in @entity19			0
" this is essentially the next step that was required for 3 - d display technology without glasses , " said physicist @entity20 , who studies optical science at the @entity22 and was not associated with the new work			2
we see the world in three dimensions because our eyes are spaced slightly apart , each looking out at a different angle			2
your brain combines the information from both eyes , determining where each object in your field of view is to generate depth perception			2
to achieve @entity43 movies or television , the trick is to send a slightly different , offset picture to each eye			2
special glasses handle this task for most modern @entity43 blockbuster movies , with each lens only letting in one polarization of light			1
polarization describes the direction in which the electromagnetic waves in light oscillate , either up - down , left - right , or something in between			2
when you sit down to watch something like " @entity63 , " two projectors are displaying two images on the same screen , with the light from one polarized left - right and the other up - down			1
this is why the screen looks kind of blurry when you take the glasses off -- there are two movies playing on it at the same time			1
the @entity43 glasses correct the situation by separating these images , allowing the left - projector movie to go to your left eye and the right - projector movie into your right			2
but needing two projectors perfectly synced in a theater is awkward and expensive			1
there are some glasses - free methods around , where a special filter covering the screen sends some of the light to your right eye and some to your left , creating a @entity43 image			1
this is the technology in @entity98 's @entity97 gaming system and several smart phone displays , such as the @entity100			0
in a movie theater , this glasses - free @entity43 technique would require the projector to sit behind the screen , but most theaters are not designed for this			0
the new method would allow movie theaters to keep their projectors where they 've always been , behind the audience , and uses fairly simple optical technology			1
a special array sits in front of the projector and polarizes its light			0
a filter covering the screen then obscures different vertical regions of the screen , like the slats of venetian blinds			0
each of your eyes , sitting at a slightly different angle , has some of the screen blocked and some of the screen visible			0
the movie has the right - eye and left - eye images interleaved in vertical columns with one another			0
the trick then is to have the light visible to your left eye contain the left - eye pixels and vice versa for the right eye			0
the new method is less cumbersome than both the current two - projector and the behind - the - screen - projector methods			1
but because it blocks some of the light to your different eyes , the current image resolution is fairly low			1
@entity20 expects that 3 - d movie companies will be interested in upgrading the method 's abilities and resolution to bring glasses - free @entity43 to the masses			1
" this technology is still in its infancy , but it 's a new step that was hidden for a long time , " @entity20 said			0

@entity13 researchers create way to watch **3d** movies with no glasses
method blocks some light to viewers eyes , creating **3d** effect
current method , using two projectors , is awkward and expensive
