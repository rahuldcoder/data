@entity0 -- police should have considered a 13 - year - old robbery suspect 's age when he was questioned without his parents present , a divided @entity2 ruled thursday , concluding a child in such a situation would not have reasonably felt free to walk away from the interrogation			1
the 5 - 4 decision dealt with whether the unnamed juvenile was entitled to be given a @entity13 warning , telling him he need not answer questions			1
" it is beyond dispute that children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances would feel to free to leave , " said justice @entity15 for the court			1
" seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality , we hold that a child 's age properly informs the @entity13 custody analysis			1
" the case was one of several this term dealing with the extent of constitutional rights for minors			0
" @entity38 " was a 13 - year - old special - needs public school student in 2005			1
he was escorted from his seventh - grade class and taken to a conference room			2
there a @entity41 , @entity42 , police investigator -- along with an assistant principal , school resource officer and an intern -- asked the boy if he wanted to talk about some recent criminal activity in the area			1
the african - american boy agreed to talk			2
the door was closed but not locked			0
after first denying any involvement , @entity38 admitted breaking into several neighborhood homes and stealing items , including a camera			0
after the confession , the police officer told the boy he did not have to answer further questions , but he continued talking and gave further incriminating statements			1
the adults testified the youngster never asked to cease the questioning or to leave the room			0
when the 30 - to 45 - minute session ended , the boy was allowed to leave and catch his bus for home			0
officers later that day obtained a search warrant of his house and found the stolen goods			0
at no time were the youth 's legal guardian or parents notified , and @entity13 rights were never administered			2
larceny and juvenile delinquency charges were filed , and courts subsequently allowed the confession to be admitted as evidence , concluding @entity38 was not in custody and talked voluntarily			0
the appeal focused on the school interrogation , since the high court has previously ruled underage students are subject to some restrictions on their movements in that setting			2
the 1966 @entity2 ruling in @entity13 established clear guidelines to protect all criminal suspects from being compelled to give self - incriminating testimony			1
as seen on countless cop shows on tv , the warnings protect against police coercion , but also establish when a person is " in custody			0
" such factors as location and the length and nature of the interrogation all would be factors			0
weighing that , courts must make an objective determination of " how a reasonable man in the suspect 's position would have understood his situation " about agreeing to talk			0
but this case came down to how the " reasonable man " objective standard could be applied to a 13 - year - old boy			1
the majority said age is another of many factors that must be considered			0
" officers and judges need no imaginative powers , knowledge of developmental psychology , training in cognitive science , or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a child 's age , " @entity15 wrote			1
" they simply need the common sense to know that a 7 - year - old is not a 13 - year - old and neither is an adult			1
" @entity15 and the justices ordered the state court to take another look at whether the boy was in custody , and to decide that question by taking into account the " relevant circumstances " of the interrogation that @entity15 articulated			2
she was supported by justices @entity143 , @entity145 , @entity146 , and @entity147			0
in dissent , justice @entity148 accused the majority of injecting " personal characteristics " and a " reality - based approach " to @entity13 that will lead to that legal standard continually shifting			1
" if @entity13 's rigid , one - size - fits - all standards fail to account for the unique needs of juveniles , the response should be to rigorously apply the constitutional rule against coercion to ensure that the rights of minors are protected			2
there is no need to run @entity13 off the rails , " @entity148 wrote			1
" bit by bit , @entity13 will lose the clarity and ease of application that has long been viewed as one of its chief justifications			2
" he was backed by chief justice @entity175 and conservative colleagues justice @entity176 and @entity177			0
the case is @entity38 v. @entity42 ( 09 - 11121 )			0

a 13 - year - old suspect was questioned by a police officer at school
the court says officials need to consider age when applying @entity13 guidelines
@entity15 : officers simply need to use common sense
@entity148 , in dissent , says @entity13 is being " run off the rails "
