@entity0 -- a former @entity0 public schools official is suing the system over settlements with dozens of students who were awarded $ 470,000 each , alleging that a teacher sentenced to prison on charges of lewd behavior never came into abusive contact with those children			1
the lawsuit , by former chief risk officer @entity12 of @entity13 , accuses the district of corruption , lawyer cronyism and incompetence in the way it settled the lawsuit against former teacher @entity22 of @entity22			1
@entity24 was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for putting pupils in bondage , and then photographing them with semen - filled spoons held at their mouths and 3 - inch cockroaches crawling across their faces			0
@entity24 had pleaded no contest to felony lewd acts on 23 children			2
the scandal led to almost 200 students suing the district , claiming that they , too , were victims			1
in a @entity1 interview wednesday at his @entity41 attorney 's office , @entity12 said he urged the system to wait until a conviction in the @entity24 case before settling the student claims			1
among the student allegations was that they were forced to eat cookies with semen on them , @entity12 said			0
" there 's clearly some children where there was no evidence that they ate a cookie , had semen in their mouth or fluid in their mouth			2
they are alleging , but it 's not necessary true , " @entity12 said			0
" i did not agree with settling , but they felt it was politically better and they felt the pressure " from the scandal , he said			1
" but my view point was to wait and see because we really do n't know if there was semen in the classroom			0
" this is a sad case , " he added			0
" there is corruption at @entity22 sadly , and there 's a lot of people in place supervising that do n't have the level of expertise needed to see ( the corruption )			0
" last june , the school system sought a court injunction imposing " a gag order " on breed to keep him from publicly discussing " the @entity22 settlement fiasco , " his suit said			1
but a judge dismissed the district 's request as long as @entity12 never mentioned the names of the alleged student victims , @entity12 said			1
on wednesday , a media consultant hired by the school district to be its spokesman dismissed the allegations as " frivolous " and described @entity12 as a disgruntled employee			1
" the allegations are false			0
there was a rigorous processing of all the settlements , " said @entity99 , the consultant serving as spokesman for the system 's general counsel			0
" there had to be substantial information before any settlement was made			0
" these are nothing more than baseless allegations by a disgruntled former employee , " @entity99 continued			0
" he 's simply trying to latch on to the attention being paid to @entity22 to try to line his own pocket with millions of dollars , taxpayer dollars			0
" it 's really unfortunate that he would choose to do this and impact the families that are already impacted by the incident in @entity123 and take this money from our students and schools with baseless allegations , " @entity99 added			2
last year , general counsel @entity128 told @entity1 that the district was paying $ 30 million to settle what now amounts to 63 of 190 students ' claims alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by @entity24			1
@entity128 called the agreements " good settlements " at the time			0
the remaining students ' claims are still pending			2
breed 's lawsuit , which seeks at least $ 10 million in damages , claims @entity0 @entity141 school district chief business and compliance counsel @entity142 and @entity128 ignored a school list of approved outside attorneys			1
instead , the lawsuit claims , they hired outside representation based on @entity142 's " personal relationships " with those law firms			1
those newly hired legal firms did n't have experience in sexual assault and molestation cases , but still represented the system in handling legal claims filed in the @entity22 abuse case , the lawsuit claims			2
one outside counsel was a law firm where @entity142 once worked , and another was an attorney who was a law school classmate of @entity142 's , the suit charged			2
@entity142 and @entity128 could n't be reached for comment wednesday			0
school spokesman @entity99 said he was speaking on their behalf			0
under an alleged " cronyism " arrangement , the outside attorneys were paid between $ 390 to $ 450 an hour -- more than twice the $ 175 - an - hour rate that the board typically paid on its approved list of outside attorneys , the lawsuit claims			1
when asking about the legal fees , school spokesman @entity99 said the @entity22 case " is a different size of scope in litigation than is typically seen			0
" " we really need specialists who understood the issues and had the bandwidth to handle the amount of claims being brought forth , " @entity99 said			0
@entity12 found " numerous errors " in vetting each student claims , such as the lack of signatures verifying information , lack of @entity195 numbers , and the wrong names when compared to school classroom rosters , the lawsuit claims			1
for example , one pupil who received $ 470,000 " did not attend classes with the abuser " and " essentially maintained others wanted and got money so he should get some as well , " the lawsuit states			1
in another example , a girl " was touched just once on the shoulder by the accused teacher , " and when this issue was raised , the outside counsel contacted the mediator , who ruled he could n't change the settlement , the suit said			2
" because the proper vetting process was not followed , lausd will be forced to pay $ 470,000 for a single act of touching on the shoulder , " the lawsuit said			1
@entity12 , who has 30 years of experience in risk management , was hired by the district to serve as chief risk officer from april 2012 to june 2013 at a salary of $ 14,438 a month , the lawsuit said			1
@entity12 claimed that when he acted as a whistle - blower in reporting his allegations , his contract was not renewed in an act of retaliation , and he was denied more than $ 14,000 in annual contributions to his retirement account			0
at the time the school district announced the $ 30 million settlement , @entity128 said taxpayer money and possibly school insurance funds would cover that cost , but those insurance carriers are now refusing to indemnify the school system and fund the settlement because of " attorney incompetence by corruptly selected counsel , " the lawsuit contends			1
a second teacher at @entity22 , @entity22 , was also charged with felony lewd conduct with a girl under age 14 in the aftermath of the @entity24 case in 2011			2
@entity246 has pleaded not guilty , and his case is pending .			0
