-- @entity2 striker @entity1 struck just four minutes from time to give @entity5 champions @entity4 a 1 - 0 win at @entity7 -- their first victory in four league games			1
@entity1 scored a vital goal for @entity4 as they claimed a 1 - 0 @entity5 victory at @entity7			1
@entity1 converted @entity14 's cross on 86 minutes to give @entity16 's side three league points for the first time this month despite another unimpressive performance			0
@entity4 last picked up three points in a @entity5 game on september 13 when they hammered @entity22 3 - 0			2
since then the gloss on @entity16 's first season in charge has faded badly after @entity26 hammered his side 5 - 2 at home on september 20 and then slumped to a 1 - 0 defeat at minnows @entity31 the following week			1
cries of " @entity16 out ! " were first heard around @entity34 's @entity33 in their previous league game on october 4 when a poor @entity37 side were allowed to score two goals in the last 10 minutes to poach a 3 - 3 draw			0
despite their first - half domination in @entity7 , @entity4 could not break down the home defense and lost striker @entity42 , the league 's top scorer last season , who limped off after 40 minutes to be replaced by @entity46			2
and another of @entity34 top attacking options from last season was substituted on 59 minutes when @entity16 switched @entity50 midfielder @entity49 for @entity2 's @entity51			0
with @entity7 unable to create any chances and @entity4 unable to convert theirs , it looked like the game was heading towards a 0 - 0 draw until @entity1 struck			1
but @entity16 's side will need to do much better against @entity57 in tuesday night 's @entity59 game in @entity34			0
promoted @entity60 went top of the table with a flurry of late goals to seal a 5 - 2 victory at 10 - man @entity31 which put them level with @entity69 but leading the table on goal difference			1
two goals from @entity60 's @entity73 led the charge and made the @entity76 and @entity77 striker the league 's top scorer with nine so far this season			0
however , @entity69 have the chance to recapture top spot when they host @entity84 on sunday			0
also on saturday , @entity85 moved up one place to third place thanks to their 2 - 0 win at @entity89			1
striker @entity90 scored his eighth league goal of the season when he converted a penalty after just six minutes and a 61st minute header from @entity96 midfielder @entity95 sealed the win			0
@entity99 drop from third to sixth in the table after losing 2 - 1 at @entity101 while @entity102 picked up their first league win for nearly a month as midfielder @entity104 netted first - half goals in a 4 - 1 win over @entity107 to put @entity109 's side fifth in the table			2
ten - man @entity111 lost 1 - 0 at @entity22 to stay in the bottom three while @entity113 scored in injury time to seal a 3 - 3 draw at @entity26 .			2

@entity1 scores only goal to give @entity4 a 1 - 0 win at @entity7
@entity1 's 86th minute strike is enough to end @entity124 champions ' win *drought*
@entity60 top of table with flurry of late goals to seal a 5 - 2 victory at @entity31
