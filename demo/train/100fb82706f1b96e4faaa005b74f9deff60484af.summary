-- it is 10 years since @entity2 became the darling of @entity5 's hallowed @entity4			1
just 17 and with a mere six grand slam appearances to her name , she was a huge underdog against @entity9 -- then already a formidable force in women 's tennis			1
but @entity2 did the unthinkable , demolishing the defending champion and delighting the crowd , as the smiling teenager opened up her mobile phone on court to contact her mother			1
it was " the jump start of my career , where it all began for me , " says the first @entity23 woman to win @entity5			1
" to think back that i was holding that trophy as a 17 - year - old girl is really special			2
it really makes me feel really happy inside when i look back on those years , " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity26 ahead of this week 's return to @entity29 's hallowed grass courts			1
" of course it was a little bit of a blur , so young , i was in this incredible dream , this incredible run to the finals			0
and then winning it , it takes a while to realize , ' yes , i 've done it , i 've accomplished that , i 've won @entity5			1
' " a decade later , the two women are again favorites to win @entity5 -- even if the grass surface has not always proved a happy stomping ground for @entity2 in the intervening years			1
she has reached the final just once since those heady days in 2004 -- losing to @entity46 surprise package @entity44 in 2011 -- and made a shock second - round exit last year to @entity50 's 131st - ranked @entity49			2
meanwhile , @entity9 has won three more championships in @entity29 in the past decade			1
the dream for many fans is of a repeat @entity55 final showdown , but last friday 's draw means they could meet in the last eight			0
" for both of us 10 years later to still be grinding , and working , and loving what we do -- i think it 's really inspiring for a lot of people around the world because we 've gone through a lot in those years , " says @entity2 , who won her fifth grand slam title at this month 's @entity63 , while @entity9 exited early			1
" we 've battled through injuries , through losses , through wins and we 're still there			0
" baby - faced teen to sports star supreme right now , @entity2 's confidence is sky - high -- though it was n't always the case			1
the five - time grand slam winner sacked coach @entity79 last year after just one match together , which she lost			1
her new partnership with @entity83 's @entity82 appears to be working out a lot better ; in @entity85 she regained the title that @entity9 took from her the previous year			2
but it was her first @entity5 win that really set @entity2 on her way to global superstardom			1
within a week she was on the cover of @entity94 and today banks about $ 30 million a year , of which barely a fifth comes from on - court prize money thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals with the likes of @entity100 and @entity101			1
it makes her the world 's highest - paid female athlete on @entity106 ' list			2
" no matter how prepared you may be , i actually think it 's better not to know what will happen , " she says of her @entity5 win			2
" because everything that comes your way seems so better and so much more when you do n't have expectations and you have incredible opportunities , " " i look back and i go , ' wow , i was on the cover of @entity94 as a 17 - year - old girl			2
' " i was not naive but i did n't know how cool these things really were and i think that is why i kept myself really grounded , because i was happy and i smiled and i had a great time doing those other things			0
" love match and with fame , came intense media scrutiny			0
today , @entity2 's every move on and off the court is followed by the press -- from her burgeoning business empire to her blossoming relationship with fellow tennis player @entity129 , who won the @entity5 warmup tournament at @entity29 's @entity131 last week			1
the @entity132 -- nicknamed " @entity129 " after comparisons with men 's legend @entity134 early in his career -- credited partner @entity2 for the victory			2
she appears similarly enthused by the 18 - month romance			0
" he 's so talented out on the court and so smart at what he does			0
it 's really inspiring to watch him play -- even when he does n't have a good day and loses , i am really inspired by what he is able to produce out there , " she says			0
" it 's really fun , we enjoy watching each other play			0
it is also always nice to have good company , that understands what you go through , the tough and the good			0
to be able to share that , i am certainly lucky			0
" @entity156 in the last decade @entity2 has become a lucrative brand in her own right , signing a three - year advertising deal with @entity160 last year among her many endorsements , and launching her own confectionery called @entity163			1
where does this business drive come from ? " i am actually really scared of doing nothing , " she says			0
" because all my career , all my life i 've woken up , made my tea or coffee and then am ready to do something , to commit to something			0
" it has been tennis for many years and especially when i missed out a year from shoulder surgery , it gave me time to think ' well , this can happen on any given day and you can not play sport anymore , what are you going to do ? ' " it might be hard to believe that the businesswoman leading this sporting empire , still sees herself as the teenage girl who climbed up to hug her father @entity183 in the players ' box after her @entity5 triumph			1
" i think from a very young age , i knew i did n't have so many strengths in my game , " she says			0
" i knew i was n't the strongest athlete out there , i knew i did n't have an incredible amount of weapons out there but i knew from a young age that focus , especially in tennis , was one of the biggest weapons that you can have			0
" for the next fortnight , that focus is firmly on @entity5			2
