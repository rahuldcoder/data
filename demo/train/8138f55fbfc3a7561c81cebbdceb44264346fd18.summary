@entity0 -- in the world of gaming , money does n't necessarily buy respect			0
online games designed to be played on @entity7 , called " social games " in industry jargon , have multiplied in the last few years , since the world 's largest social network introduced a web platform for friend - enhanced applications			1
but even at a time when @entity15 , which makes the wildly popular " @entity16 , " is valued higher than software giant @entity17 , social games do n't have much street cred among hard - core gamers or industry veterans			1
a clearer picture of these dynamics emerged at last week 's @entity23 in @entity0 , where @entity1 attended panels and interviewed designers and programmers			0
in the natural pecking order of game - making , visionaries like @entity29 's @entity28 can attract followers that hang on his every word			1
but at the opposite end , creators of social games struggle to legitimize their work among their peers			1
this theme was pervasive enough to warrant its own panel at @entity23			0
the hour - plus discussion was titled " @entity43 ! @entity45 , " and it attracted a large audience			0
@entity47 , a lead designer for @entity48 , @entity50 's social - game division , spent his time onstage feeding many of the stereotypes			1
something changed two years ago that formed a storm cloud over the land of @entity7 games , he said			1
" one game changed the entire games industry , " @entity47 said , standing in front of a silhouette of a cartoon farmer			2
" and this game is ' @entity64			0
' " " @entity64 " was a precursor to the more popular " @entity16 " from @entity15			0
these games earn revenue by encouraging players to click on advertisements , or through micro-payments , in which players cough up real money in exchange for virtual goods , such as barns or livestock			2
" this formula instills bad habits , " @entity47 said			0
" you 're doing ' making lots of money ' right			2
you 're doing ' engaging lots of users ' right , " he said , addressing developers			2
" you 're not making good games			2
" @entity48 introduced two new @entity7 games during @entity23			1
the company plans to release " @entity90 " -- a story - driven , role - playing game set in a medieval town -- on march 21			1
about a week later , @entity48 intends to debut a puzzle game called " @entity94			0
" one part is a " hidden object " scavenger hunt , and another is a new take on those popular games in magazines or on bar machines that present two seemingly identical pictures and ask people to spot the differences between them			0
@entity106 , the game 's creative director , said he put a lot of thought into themes for his game 's story , which involves members of an organization tasked with protecting the flow of time			1
before @entity48 , @entity106 worked on the complex computer game " @entity117 , " in which players populate a new world with creatures they create			0
@entity122 , @entity15 's ceo and therefore the veritable king of social gaming , did n't attend his company 's @entity23 party or appear on any panels			2
instead he dispatched chief designer @entity128 , who defended his company 's work , saying that @entity15 's games -- most recently , " @entity16 " spinoffs such as " @entity132 " and " @entity133 " -- help people keep in touch with friends			2
but that did n't stop other @entity23 attendees from criticizing the social - games trend			1
@entity29 president @entity142 , in his keynote speech , commended competitors in the console arena but had no kind words for gaming on smartphones or social networks			0
even so , rival @entity149 , a major @entity152 console game company , is moving quickly to add social networking features			0
and two news media empires are making aggressive plays in the social - game space			1
@entity157 , which owns @entity158 , and @entity159 , which owns several big @entity161 sites , recently created divisions for publishing @entity7 games			1
gaming has outpaced other categories in its successful adoption of social networks , said @entity7 founder @entity168 during an october announcement of his support for a venture capital fund dedicated to social apps			1
" the games and stuff that have happened on this platform are just amazing			0
@entity15 is a great example of this , " @entity168 said			0
" five years out , i think the world is going to look a lot more like @entity15			0
" for developers of social games , the challenge now is convincing skeptics that becoming @entity15 is an honorable goal .			1

@entity7 game developers say they 're sometimes put at the bottom of the pecking order
that 's despite the fact that social - game business is very *profitable*
some critics consider social games money - driven rather than artistic
