@entity0 -- a judicial council on thursday admonished the chief judge of the nation 's largest federal appeals court for having " sexually explicit photos and videos " on his personal web site , but decided against any further punishment			1
the panel chose not to discipline judge @entity11 beyond the admonishment			1
judge @entity11 , 58 , of the @entity14 , @entity15 - based 9th @entity13 previously apologized and had recommended an investigation because of the public controversy over the material			1
a panel of judges assigned to investigate concluded @entity11 's " possession of sexually explicit offensive material combined with his carelessness in failing to safeguard his sphere of privacy was judicially imprudent			1
" his actions , the panel wrote , " can reasonably be seen as having resulted in embarrassment to the institution of the federal judiciary			1
" but @entity11 was not disciplined because he had removed himself from an ongoing obscenity trial when news broke of the visual material on @entity35 , which the judge launched in 2002 , according to the 41 - page opinion issued by the judicial council			1
according to the council 's written opinion , the material included a photograph of naked women painted like dairy cows , a woman shaving her pubic hair , and a video of a half - dressed man " cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal			1
" @entity11 testified to a judicial conduct panel that much of the material was " like odd things that i 've thrown into a room without looking at them			2
" he said some of the files were e-mailed by friends , much of which he did not bother to view			0
he admitted storing some of the sexually explicit photos , but said , " i do n't know why i kept them			0
" the judge also said he never considered his site public and thought he had blocked access to the subcategory file in question , which was labeled " stuff			2
" there was no immediate reaction from @entity11 or his lawyer to the panel 's admonishment			2
@entity11 had earlier apologized to the investigative panel for his " unfortunate carelessness			1
" " i have caused embarrassment to the federal judiciary , " he said			1
" and thus whatever shame was cast on me personally , it reflected on my colleagues and our system of justice as well			0
" the controversy erupted when @entity11 was about to serve as a trial judge -- separate from his work on the higher appeal court -- in a 2008 obscenity prosecution of adult film producer @entity88			2
@entity11 recused himself when the @entity89 published a story about the web site material , and he later asked for a probe into the incident			1
the @entity95 case has not gone to trial , but is on appeal over pending motions at the @entity99			0
@entity11 is not expected to take part in the matter			2
@entity11 is one of the most colorful and outspoken members of the federal bench			2
born in communist @entity104 , he emigrated to the @entity106 at age 12 and still speaks with an @entity109 accent			0
his parents were @entity111 survivors			0
he was named to his current seat in 1985 by president @entity113 , and he was the youngest federal appeals judge in the nation at the time			0
a mainstream @entity117 conservative with libertarian views on free speech , the judge is admired for his writing skills , intellectual curiosity and sense of humor			0
he is also one of the few federal judges who will do press interviews , speaking with @entity1 on several occasions about a variety of topics			0
he also wrote an online " diary " for @entity130 a few years ago			0
he is especially outspoken in oral arguments on his appeals court , and his detractors say he tends to dominate the questioning , often to the dismay of his fellow judges .			0
