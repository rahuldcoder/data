@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 looks at @entity6 's life , she sees the number five			1
numerologist @entity4 says that with his numbers , @entity6 was a draw to fans			1
@entity6 's talent was discovered when he was 5 years old , he came to fame as a member of the @entity14 and he planned a series of 50 concert dates in @entity17 , @entity18 , as part of a comeback tour before he died on june 25 at the age of 50			1
for @entity25 , a noted numerologist and author , those facts are very telling : " @entity26 is the number for drama , and it was in his life his whole life			2
" for many fans , the lure of @entity6 as a performer and pop icon was magical			2
those who deal in the paranormal are tuned in to that magic			2
numerology deals with the influence of numbers on personal characteristics and human affairs			0
@entity25 -- who has appeared on nationally syndicated television and radio shows and is known as the " @entity45 " -- said that by taking @entity6 's birth date ( august 29 , 1958 , or 8/29/1958 ) she could chart his personality			1
his was " six life path , " she said , meaning he was magnetic and drew people to him			0
that , coupled with the fact that he was born on a two day made him irresistible , she said			0
" if you are born on a two day and are a six life path then @entity56 and the world seem to fall in love with you , " @entity4 said			0
" it 's almost as if you always get a shot with that energy if you shoot for stardom , and then you can sabotage it , " @entity25 said			0
" @entity63 was born on a two day , and she 's a six life path ; @entity65 was born on a two day , and she 's a six life path ; and @entity67 was born on a two day , and is a six life path			0
" such people , @entity4 said , thrive on the attention			0
psychic @entity71 said @entity6 could n't help but attract such attention , even if it resulted in a life of isolation			1
" he 's an old soul with an enormous amount of creative artistic energy that pours to him and from him , " said @entity71 , who works as a " soul intuitive " in @entity0 , @entity1 , and whose clients include celebrities he declines to name			0
" whenever he 's doing his magic he 's untouchable , and i think that 's the reason everybody gravitates toward him			0
" and despite all of @entity6 's troubles , @entity71 said he believes the star will have an opportunity at success and fame again			1
unlike other souls that stay in the nonphysical realm anywhere from 70 to 150 years , he said , he believes the singer 's soul will return quickly -- within the next 20 years -- because @entity6 was such a perfectionist that he will want to " pick up where he left off			1
" " if not as a performer , then a @entity100 / @entity6 / whoever , the top producers that get mass [ music ] out to the world to uplift them , " @entity71 said			1
fans continue to gravitate toward @entity6 even as they try to make sense of his passing because mourning him reinvigorates the energy and attention surrounding him , @entity71 said			2
" he was untouchable when he was connected to his soul and what he came to this planet to do , " @entity71 said			0
" the average person looks at that and they believe that if they can touch it -- or have him touch them -- then maybe some of it would rub off			0
" the desire for such a connection can cause devastation now that @entity6 is gone , said psychic consultant @entity125 , who has worked extensively in paranormal research and consulted for major @entity128 studios			1
" even though we 've never met @entity6 , people create a symbiotic relationship with this image or this person , " @entity125 said			2
" we project all of the positive aspects of ourselves , all of the wonderful things onto this image of perfection or near perfection that we see , and we imagine subconsciously that this person is in agreement with the deepest part of ourselves			0
" when this is no longer possible because this person is gone , it creates a vacuum within us , so people need to maintain a psychological or even a spiritual stability by creating a fixed image of @entity6 , " he said			1
@entity125 said he fully expects people to come forward claiming to have communicated with @entity6 , but that any credible professional psychic or medium will not attempt to connect with @entity6 for at least six months to a year and will only do so at the behest of a family member or an intimate friend of the singer			1
in the meantime , @entity71 said fans can still reach out to the singer 's energy in a simple way : " the greatest way to connect with @entity6 is through listening to his music			2
