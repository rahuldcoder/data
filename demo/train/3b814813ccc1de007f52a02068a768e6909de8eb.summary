@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the december chill of @entity5 , @entity3 stands on the spot where seven teenagers attacked his brother and another @entity10 man five years ago as part of the pastime they made out of hunting and beating up @entity14			1
his brother , @entity16 immigrant @entity15 , was fatally stabbed by one of the attackers in a sport authorities say the youths referred to as " beaner hopping			1
" authorities called it a hate crime			2
@entity26 points to a patch of grass near the @entity30 station in this waterfront village where the confrontation began on the night of november 8 , 2008			1
there was the spot where a knife pierced @entity15 's chest ; the house where his cries for help went unheeded ; the fence where his body crumpled and bled to death			1
" for me , it 's a symbol , " @entity26 , 38 , said			2
" that was the end of something , but it was the beginning of the change			2
a regular person , bleeding ... stood up and fought for what was right			0
" another step in that change came tuesday when @entity53 legislators voted 14 - 0 , with four absent , for an agreement that gives the @entity55 rare oversight of the @entity53 police			1
county officials later said another vote was taken with three of the absent legislators present , and the settlement was approved 17 - 0			1
the 27 - page agreement settles a federal investigation of discriminatory policing in immigrant communities in @entity53 , one of the nation 's largest suburbs and home to ritzy @entity70			1
that investigation was triggered by the 2008 hate crime , which fueled international outcry and exposed a pattern of anti-immigrant violence and what community leaders called police inaction			1
the agreement calls for additional police training , accountability and outreach to @entity14 ; better tracking of hate crimes and police discrimination ; regular meetings with @entity10 leaders ; and more bilingual officers			1
the settlement does not cite wrongdoing or specific problems with the @entity93 or its policies , even though the @entity55 inquiry found that police helped created a climate where hate crimes went unreported and officers routinely ignored bias attacks			1
" the cops that looked the other way are still there , " said @entity101 , a lawyer and program director at the @entity103			0
" the real issue is , can they reconstruct the culture of the police so that police do not look the other way ? we feel they have done a good job of making the police more accountable			1
" a step forward for @entity3 and others , the settlement is a tiny step for a county trying desperately to shed its reputation as a bastion of anti-immigrant fear and resentment			1
" let 's not be hypocrites , " @entity26 told @entity2			0
" who were the police officers who did not follow up on these crimes ? why should i believe these people will change ? no one has been named in connection with these cover ups			1
" after the @entity15 slaying , dozens of immigrants told federal and county officials about hate crimes they suffered and reports made to officers who failed to investigate , according to @entity143 , senior litigation counsel for @entity144 , formerly called the @entity144			1
@entity143 believes the @entity55 failed by not investigating these other alleged crimes reported by the county 's @entity10 community as part of its settlement with @entity53			1
that failure , according to @entity143 , has deprived immigrants of the truth and the entire community of a " critical learning moment , " said @entity143 , whose @entity158 - based advocacy group first took the allegations to federal investigators			1
the group will ask the @entity55 and @entity53 officials to sign another agreement calling on the county to investigate unsolved hate crimes and establish why previous attacks were ignored			1
@entity167 , director of the @entity168 of the @entity169 , said the young men who preyed on immigrants did not fear any consequences			0
" there were instances leading up to that terrible night where kids were out ' beaner hopping ' and beating up who they perceived to be undocumented immigrants and never got more than a slap on the wrist , " @entity167 said			0
" so often the police would leave them alone or encourage people not to press charges or , if charges were pressed , they were something like disorderly conduct or something light , " he added			1
" they would say , ' they 're just teenagers messing around			0
' " @entity53 deputy chief @entity194 acknowledged that with the growth of the county 's @entity198 - speaking population , officers had trouble communicating with crime victims			1
but @entity202 denied that the police fostered a climate that encouraged hate crimes			2
" it 's important to know that the @entity55 came in to look at that allegation , " he said , " and there was no finding on their part			1
" @entity202 said some undocumented immigrants might have been reluctant to report crimes because of their legal status			0
but the 2,000 - officer department wants the message out that " their status is not a factor for us			0
" " i 'd like to think we are heading in the right direction , " he said , referring to police and community relations			1
" it 's going to take a long time to get that trust back			0
" ' we 're not going to let this happen again ' on @entity230 in @entity0 , a quiet village of about 12,000 people on the south shore of @entity5 , four men from @entity234 and @entity235 sitting in a laundromat said they believe some things have changed , while others have not , after the @entity26 slaying			0
" the police treat you a little better , " said one man , declining to give his name			2
" you do n't see small groups of kids hanging around like before , " said another			0
" there are more police around			2
" " but you know you 're still not safe out alone at night , " said a third			0
verbal and physical assaults against immigrants continue , including , the men said , a recent stabbing of a @entity10 immigrant outside a deli in @entity258 by a group of men armed with bats and knives			2
but the police are more attentive to @entity14 , occasionally picking up men walking home alone at night and dropping them off at their destinations , they said			2
the climate of fear in @entity53 was created in part by immigration opponents who found sympathetic ears in the area , the @entity268 said in a report one year after @entity26 's killing			1
former county executive @entity277 , an anti-immigration firebrand who employed measures seen as hostile toward @entity14 , has been singled out by advocates and immigrants alike as an enabler of the hate			2
" @entity53 became ground zero for the anti-immigrant movement and it threw up a sign saying we 're a county of intolerance , " said @entity283 , executive director of the @entity284			1
for decades , the influx of undocumented immigrants in @entity53 generated anger and tension in the neighborhood			1
recent arrivals said longtime residents make sharp distinctions between assimilated immigrants who 've been here for a generation or two and those who arrived more recently			0
those are perceived as a threat to local jobs and the quality of life			0
in recent decades , thousands of immigrants from @entity308 have arrived on @entity5			0
@entity0 's @entity10 population has risen steadily , with @entity16 making up the largest group , according to advocates			1
the hostility and attacks predated the @entity26 slaying			0
in 2001 , two @entity316 day laborers were nearly beaten to death			2
in 2003 , the home of a @entity316 family was burned down			0
both incidents occurred in the nearby town of @entity322			0
" that was a learning moment for schools and communties to address that issue , and they did n't want to , " said @entity323 , who teaches @entity198 in the @entity53 schools			1
" they swept it under the carpet			0
across the board everybody failed at that moment			0
" moving on seven students from @entity335 were arrested and convicted in @entity26 's death			2
one of them , @entity338 , who was 17 and a star athlete at the time of the attack , is serving a 25 - year sentence for manslaughter as a hate crime			0
six others pleaded guilty and are serving sentences of between five and eight years			0
" when this happened , you heard the teachers , the parents saying we did n't know this was going on , " @entity323 said of @entity26 's death			2
" but all the kids knew			0
and there 's still no visible youth movement saying , ' let 's talk about this			0
we 're not going to let this happen again			0
' " two years ago , federal authorities recommended changes to promote trust between police and @entity14 , including " enhanced training and investigation of allegations of hate crimes and bias incidents , meaningful access to police services for individuals with limited @entity373 proficiency , " the @entity55 said in a statement when the settlement was announced			1
the @entity55 would monitor the county 's compliance for at least a year			1
" all residents of @entity53 deserve full and unbiased police protection , regardless of national origin , race , or citizenship status , " said @entity379 attorney @entity378			1
@entity15 , who was 37 when he died and worked in a dry cleaning store , is remembered in a scholarship awarded each year by a nonprofit for whom his brother now works			1
every year , @entity3 and community leaders hold a vigil at the intersection near the @entity0 train station where @entity26 died			2
in 2010 , the corner was renamed @entity395			0
@entity26 travels around in his brother 's old car , giving talks against bullying and hate crimes at schools around the region			0
two students at @entity335 have been awarded the scholarship bearing his brother 's name , but @entity26 still has n't been invited to speak there			0
" the guys who killed my brother still have friends in the school , " he said			2
" they want to avoid any problems			0
" said @entity323 , who teaches @entity198 at a junior high school : " it 's almost like the county wants damage control rather than to take responsibility			2
they want this to go away			0

@entity16 immigrant @entity15 was attacked and killed in 2008
his death triggered a federal investigation in @entity53
county leaders have voted *unanimously* for @entity55 oversight of police
