-- amid the skyscrapers , sidewalks and subways of @entity5 , scientists have discovered a new species of frog within view of the @entity9			1
in fact , the researchers who discovered the frog say the center of its range is @entity16 in the @entity17			1
the newly identified animal is among more than a dozen distinct leopard frog species			1
and , while it 's fairly common to find new species of animals in the remote wildness or in rain forests , to discover one in marshes and ponds within an urban area such as @entity5 is nothing short of amazing , according to @entity30 , program director with the @entity31			1
" the species is completely distinct , " said @entity30 , part of the team of scientists that found the species			2
" it has a very small range and it was quite a surprise to find a new species in @entity5			1
" @entity41 's smallest frog discovered ; it fits easily on a dime researchers used dna testing to find this so - called cryptic species , which is one species hidden within another			1
researchers basically stumbled across the new frog , @entity30 said , adding the discovery is " extremely rare			0
" " we were doing a study on a related organism , the southern leopard frog , in my lab at the @entity53 and another colleague contacted us to say we have these frogs that look like southern leopard frogs , but they do n't quite sound like southern leopard frogs , can you add some of these to your genetic analyses ? and we did and that sort of began the study			1
" scientist @entity65 at @entity66 first noticed the new amphibian sounded different from the northern and southern leopard frogs and that it had " weird - sounding calls			0
" @entity65 said the frog had a " peculiar croak			2
" it did n't have the " long snore " or " rapid chuckle " other leopard frogs have			2
the new frog had a " short , repetitive croak			2
" @entity65 says he knew from the get - go there was something odd about the frog			0
" when i first heard these frogs calling , it was so different , i knew something was very off			0
" and the dna analysis proved him right			0
the species is so new it does n't even have a name yet			0
and @entity30 said there wo n't be any naming contests for this new amphibian , either			0
" i think some people would like to name it , who knows , @entity92 , a lot of things to do with @entity5 , " @entity30 told @entity0			0
" however , we have to go back to these different museums , find the exact voucher specimen that was used for these other species and , if there is an old name that 's available then we will use that name because that 's the proper way to do it , rather than taking bids on who wants to name the new frog in @entity5			1
