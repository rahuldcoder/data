@entity0 -- the private law firm hired by @entity4 speaker @entity3 to represent the government in the federal @entity6 has suddenly pulled out of the case			1
the chairman of @entity9 said monday the firm 's internal vetting for accepting representation was " inadequate			1
" as a result , the high - profile lawyer who was to lead the legal fight for @entity15 has resigned immediately from the firm			1
@entity18 , who was a top partner at the firm , wrote in a letter , " i resign out of the firmly held belief that a representation should not be abandoned because the client 's legal position is extremely unpopular in certain quarters			1
defending unpopular clients is what lawyers do			1
" he will now defend the statute for another law firm			1
the decision by the @entity33 - based law firm to withdraw is a victory for gay - rights supporters that have tried to have the @entity6 repealed or tossed out on constitutional grounds in court			1
those groups had urged @entity9 in recent days to drop out of the case , and were preparing a national campaign to highlight the company 's efforts			1
the @entity6 was passed in 1996 by the @entity45 - controlled @entity44 and signed into law by president @entity47			2
it bars federal recognition of same - sex marriages and says states can not be forced to recognize such marriages allowed in other states			2
the @entity55 administration , which normally would defend federal laws in judicial disputes , announced earlier this year it believed the @entity6 , often referred to as @entity6 , to be unconstitutional			2
the law defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman			2
@entity3 said that with the @entity64 not participating , he had " no choice " but to act unilaterally , and moved to lead the legal defense of the law			1
@entity67 , chairman of @entity9 , said the firm had filed a motion monday to withdraw its representation of the @entity71 of the @entity4 , " on the constitutional issues " regarding the law			1
" in reviewing this assignment further , i determined that the process used for vetting this engagement was inadequate , " @entity67 said in a statement			1
" ultimately i am responsible for any mistakes that occurred and apologize for the challenges this may have created			2
" law firms typically undergo an internal review process headed by senior - level lawyers to determine which cases they will accept			1
controversial issues like same - sex marriage are normally subject to intense scrutiny to balance the legal issues with financial , ethical , and other considerations			2
the @entity90 statement made no specific mention of the reasons behind the sudden change of heart			2
@entity18 said he is going to work for a @entity0 law firm , @entity94			1
legal sources say he will be taking a number a high - profile clients with him to his new job			1
@entity18 had filed a brief a week ago while at @entity9 in a pending case from @entity101 , where a lesbian received an estate tax bill of more than $ 360,000 after her longtime partner and legal wife had died			1
he is a former solicitor general under president @entity106 , serving from 2005 to 2008			2
it was his job to defend federal laws and executive actions in court , similar to what he will be doing now as a private lawyer on retainer			0
he was mentioned at one time as a possible @entity115 nominee			0
separately , he also is representing more than two dozen states in a lawsuit against the @entity55 administration over the sweeping health care reform law passed by @entity44 last year			0
that case is pending in a federal appeals court in @entity33			0
in his resignation letter , @entity18 made clear , " i take this step not because of strongly held views about this statute			1
my thoughts about the merits of @entity6 are as irrelevant as my views about the dozens of federal statutes i defended as solicitor general			0
" " in this instance , my loyalty to the client and respect for the profession must come first , " he wrote			1
" the speaker is disappointed in the firm 's decision and its careless disregard for its responsibilities to the @entity4 in this constitutional matter , " @entity3 spokesman @entity136 told @entity1			1
" at the same time , mr. @entity18 has demonstrated legal integrity , and we are grateful for his decision to continue representing the @entity4			1
this move will ensure the constitutionality of this law is appropriately determined by the courts , rather than by the president unilaterally			0
" papers have not yet been filed for @entity18 to continue representation of the @entity4			1
@entity4 minority leader @entity153 had been vocal about her opposition to the decision to take on the case			0
" leader @entity153 shares mr. @entity67 ' apparent concerns with the lack of transparency and accountability in the way this contract was signed , " spokesman @entity157 told @entity1			1
" she also vigorously opposes using half a million taxpayer dollars or any taxpayer resources to defend discrimination at a time when republicans in @entity44 are cutting critical initiatives like education and infrastructure			0
it is now more critical than ever that speaker @entity3 fully account for his decision to sign this half million dollar contract to defend this indefensible statute			1
" @entity3 last week indicated he would make an effort to divert money from the @entity64 to fund its high - profile fight			1
" obviously , @entity64 's decision results in @entity64 no longer needing the funds it would have otherwise expended defending the constitutionality of @entity6 , " he said april 18			1
" it is my intent that those funds be diverted to the @entity4 for reimbursement of any costs incurred by and associated with the @entity4 , and not @entity64 , defending @entity6			2
" such a move would require @entity190 approval , an unlikely prospect since @entity192 control that chamber			0
president @entity55 on february 23 ordered the @entity64 to stop defending the constitutionality of the law			2
" the president has concluded that given a number of factors , including a documented history of discrimination , classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny , " said attorney general @entity196 at the time			2
the key provision in the law " fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional , " he said			0
@entity55 had previously expressed his personal opposition to the @entity6 but had never stated an opinion relating to its constitutionality			0
gay - rights supporters applauded the law firm 's decision to withdraw			2
" @entity9 has rightly chosen to put principle above politics in dropping its involvement in the defense of this discriminatory and patently unconstitutional law , " said @entity214 , president of the @entity215			1
" we are pleased to see the firm has decided to stand on the right side of history and remain true to its core values			2
" two pending lawsuits from @entity101 and @entity227 challenge the law			0
the 2nd @entity229 @entity228 , which includes both states , is the only federal circuit to have never decided the basic legal question of whether a law discriminates against gay men and lesbians			0
the @entity101 legal fight was prompted by @entity237 , who lived with her female partner , @entity237 , for more than four decades			0
they married out - of - state in 2007 , but neither the federal government nor their home state of @entity101 recognized the legal union			0
@entity244 died and left her estate to @entity237 , who was then forced to pay taxes on the money because she was not considered a legal spouse			0
in july , a federal judge in @entity252 , in a separate case , became the first to rule part of the @entity6 unconstitutional			0
district judge @entity254 said that " irrational prejudice plainly never constitutes a legitimate government interest			0
" the administration 's decision comes on the heels of other major developments in the struggle over gay and lesbian rights			0
in december , @entity55 signed legislation that will repeal the controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and bring an end to the ban on openly gay men and women serving in the armed forces			0
courts in @entity271 are considering a legal challenge to @entity273 , an initiative narrowly approved by that state 's voters in 2008			0
it defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman			0
either one of those cases could reach the @entity115 in coming months , perhaps in time to become a major issue during the 2012 election year			0
same - sex marriage is legal in five states -- @entity227 , @entity286 , @entity252 , @entity287 and @entity288 -- and in the @entity0			0
civil unions virtually equivalent to marriage are permitted in @entity291 , while several other states offer more limited civil unions or partnerships			0
the @entity101 case is @entity237 v. @entity229 ( 1:10 - cv - 08435 ) .			0

@entity9 says the vetting for accepting representation was " inadequate "
