-- a potentially deadly disease that can maim the brain has befallen two prestigious @entity4 institutions that educate the mind			1
with federal health authorities ' permission , @entity6 is distributing a drug not approved in the @entity4 to fight a campus outbreak of a rare strain of meningitis			2
as of thursday , 5,268 people had received the vaccine at the @entity16 school , representing 91 % of those who were eligible to receive it			0
@entity6 has about 5,000 undergraduate students			0
@entity20 health officials are considering following suit			0
if they and the @entity23 approve , the same vaccine could be offered at @entity24 , @entity24 , where four students came down with meningococcal disease type @entity26 , the same strain that caused the @entity6 outbreak			1
an assessment is ongoing about the effectiveness and potential risks of the vaccine , @entity31 spokeswoman @entity30 said in an e-mail friday			0
part of that effort will determine which @entity24 students would be considered high - risk and would be the best target for the vaccine , she said			1
meningitis is an infection of the protective tissue called the meninges that surrounds the brain and spinal cord			1
meningococcal disease can cause meningitis or other illnesses such as bloodstream infections			1
all four of the students infected at @entity24 got meningococcal disease , although not all four cases are meningitis			1
two students have recovered , and another is expected to soon , but the fourth has suffered serious complications			0
other germs like fungus and viruses can also lead to meningitis , but they are milder or harder to catch			1
the bacterial type is contagious and very dangerous			2
" it 's the bacterial meningitis branch that packs the most powerful punch			1
its bacterial swarm can cause brain damage , hearing loss , or learning disabilities , " according to the @entity23			1
there is no @entity72 - approved vaccine to fight the type b bacterial strain , so one had to be imported for @entity6			2
the @entity23 is communicating with local and state officials about the @entity24 situation and is the " lead on the vaccine issue , " @entity75 said			1
it starts with a ' cold ' meningococcal disease starts out like a bad chest cold , but it can spread via phlegm to the meninges			1
patients with the condition can fully recover , but @entity24 student @entity88 has not been so fortunate			1
if things go bad , meningococcal disease can bring on a stiff neck , headaches , fever , delirium and vomiting , and can result in permanent neurological damage			1
the disease can also get into the bloodstream and attack extremities , and can result in death			2
doctors may have to amputate a limb while fighting the disease , the @entity23 said			2
they had to remove @entity105 's lower legs			1
@entity88 had been doing well in school , developing strong friendships and competing for a starting position on the lacrosse team , said his father , @entity110			0
" it 's absolutely devastating to have @entity88 , in the prime of his life , be stricken " with the disease , @entity110 said			2
" we hope that @entity88 's horrific illness brings increased awareness and rapid approval by the @entity72 of the vaccine " for the type b strain			0
@entity88 is also an avid soccer player			0
the charity @entity121 is taking donations to help him meet medical expenses , including prosthetic legs and physical therapy			2
@entity126 : young , healthy groups the viral and fungal types attack mostly infants and the elderly , but the bacteria like young , healthy adults who live in close quarters -- places where they sneeze and cough on each other , forget to wash their belongings and hands , or share a glass or a kiss , the @entity23 said			0
students in dorm rooms make perfect targets			0
@entity24 spokesman @entity145 said on december 3 that the school is sending a letter to its fraternities and sororities , most of which are based off campus , asking them to refrain from large social gatherings where cups might be exchanged			1
" we 're almost certain that they 'll go along with that as we head into the holiday period here , " he said			0
luckily , bacterial meningitis is not commonplace			1
there were only 480 cases of it last year in the @entity4			0
the chances of dying go down to 15 % if someone who is infected takes vaccines and antibiotics , the @entity23 said			2
the vaccine the @entity23 recommends that college freshmen living in dorms receive a meningitis vaccine , but the vaccine approved for use in the @entity4 does not protect against the kind caused by type b bacteria			0
@entity174 pharmaceutical company @entity173 makes an inoculation called @entity176 , which is approved in @entity177 and @entity178 but is pending @entity72 approval			0
more than 1,000 students at @entity24 have received preventive antibiotics as of december 9 , but those at @entity6 are already getting the vaccine			1
the university is offering the shot to about 5,800 people -- mainly students in dorms and similar living quarters , but also some others in the community with certain medical conditions			0
health officials are not making any additional exceptions for the use of the @entity174 vaccine in the @entity4			0
anything that weakens resistance to disease -- such as age , diabetes , an @entity203 infection or drugs that suppress the immune system -- make people more susceptible to meningococcal disease , the @entity196 said			2
that includes excessive use of alcohol , another reason to put off campus bashes until the bacterial scourge is eliminated			0
@entity0 's @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0

bacterial meningitis can cause brain damage , *deafness* and lead to amputations
one @entity24 student lost his lower legs to the disease
it starts out as a *respiratory* infection but can *progress* to tissue around the brain
vaccines and antibiotics reduce the risk and help prevent the infection from killing the patient
