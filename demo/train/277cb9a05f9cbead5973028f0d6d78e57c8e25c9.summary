-- @entity1 for rhinos is 2026 , according to @entity4 officials -- the year the majestic mammals will near extinction if current poaching rates continue			1
" it 's not that far away , it 's around the corner , " cautions @entity8 , minister of water and environmental affairs in @entity4 , the country where about 75 % of the world 's rhinos are found			1
" it 's scary -- i do n't want us to get to that point , " she adds			0
" we do n't really want to be caught napping			0
" decimated by illegal poaching , the endangered rhino has increasingly come under attack in recent years			1
in @entity4 alone , some 480 rhinos have been killed since january , while last year there were 668 slaughters , a nearly 50 % jump compared to 2011			1
the alarming surge in rhino killings has been fueled by unsubstantiated beliefs in southeast @entity28 that their horns can treat all kinds of conditions , from hangovers to cancers			1
buyers in countries such as @entity36 and @entity37 are willing to pay big sums for traditional cures and this has helped create a lucrative poaching market , which is often run by sophisticated criminal syndicates			0
no time to waste but now the @entity4 government wants to cripple that black market by launching a legal once - off sale of part of its billion - dollar stockpile of rhino horns			1
it plans to put forward a proposal at the next @entity52 , in 2016 , requesting the removal of a decades - old ban on rhino horn trade			1
" we think that this is probably one of the measures that can actually help us alleviate this problem , " @entity8 told @entity0			0
read this : drone to spy on rhino poachers with @entity4 sitting on a stockpile of more than 16,400 kilograms of rhino horn , proponents of the auction argue that the move could have an immediate impact on the fight against rampant poaching			1
the government 's thinking is that it can flood the market by selling stockpiled horn and regulating trade			1
the move , advocates say , would send the current sky - high prices tumbling , thus remove the incentives for poaching , and ultimately help prevent further mass killings of the species			1
" the reality is that there are people who believe ... that this thing ( rhino horn ) has something for them , " says @entity8 , stressing that there is an urgent need to act before it 's too late			1
" we have to convince them otherwise but ( this ) ... will not just be an easy thing , " she adds			0
" it will not take us a year , two years , 15 years ; so by the time we are still doing this convincing and mobilization and actual awareness and education ... our rhino population will have been decimated			0
" ' extremely naive ' but critics say a once - off sale could end up fueling the trade even more by allowing buyers to believe that horn is a legalized commodity that it 's ok to acquire			1
@entity109 , regional director @entity110 of the @entity112 , describes @entity4 's proposals as an " extremely naive " experiment			2
he says that it 's not sensible to talk about flooding the market with horns when no one knows the extent of the potential demand			2
" firstly , we do n't understand the market at all , " he says			0
" no one has any idea of how much horn the @entity37 market could absorb and , in fact , most would argue that you could n't ever flood the market -- that based on very simple math and a very basic understanding of demand			2
" read this : boy 's website helps tourists spot big beasts " without even a reasonable understanding of demand we are walking a very dangerous line , and a spurious one at that , " @entity109 adds			0
" the illicit trade will not go away as long as demand exists and putting horn into an unknown , but seemingly infinite market , will do nothing but stimulate demand and thus continued poaching and illicit trade			2
" opponents also argue that authorities wo n't be able to regulate such a trade			0
the way to deal with the crisis , they say , is by stifling demand and dispelling the notions of rhino horns ' supposed healing powers			2
" consumer countries need to address demand , " says @entity109			0
" that is the bottom line			0
this is being confused by proposals to trade			0
" @entity8 acknowledges the risks of the move but says non action would have negative repercussions both for @entity4 and the world			2
" we all have to go into that battle together in convincing people that this ( rhino horn ) does n't really work as they think , but will that happen before 2026 ? that 's a question i doubt			1
" we ca n't sit back as we 're seeing the heritage of our country actually being poached , " adds @entity8			0
" we ca n't let the security of the country be undermined			0

@entity4 will ask for *permission* to sell some of its stockpiled rhino horn
government hopes the move will prevent more mass killings of rhinos
but critics argue that this could risk fueling demand even further
rhinos are increasingly coming under attack from poachers for their horns
