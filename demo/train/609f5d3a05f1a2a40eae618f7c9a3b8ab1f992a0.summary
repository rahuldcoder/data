-- a 49 - year - old @entity2 man grew up believing he was kidnapped from the hospital as a day - old baby and was returned at age 2 to his parents in @entity7 , months after being found abandoned in a stroller in @entity9			1
the @entity10 closed the case : the toddler looked like the missing newborn			2
the audacious kidnapping -- by a woman dressing as nurse who told the mother to hand over her infant because the doctor needed to examine him -- was a sensational crime nearly a half - century ago			0
but now the life of @entity23 has taken another extraordinary turn , he told @entity0 affiliate @entity25			1
after taking a home dna test , @entity23 said , he discovered he was n't the missing baby			1
the @entity10 has reopened the case to tackle the questions of what happened to the real kidnapped baby and who @entity23 is , exactly , he told @entity25			1
" i do n't know how old i am , or who i am , or what nationality , all those things you just take for granted , " he said			2
" the @entity10 decided that because my ears matched the @entity40 baby that i was probably the @entity40 baby			1
" on thursday , @entity23 told @entity0 he 's optimistic about a resolution			1
wrote @entity23 : " i believe that we will solve these 2 tragic mysteries			1
i feel we are one step closer to solving this , and one step closer to a happy ending ! " he declined to comment further			0
he told the @entity49 station the furor surrounding the 1964 investigation " was huge			2
" " my parents had letters from the pope , letters from people all over the country			0
it was a huge case , " he said			0
" my parents got really frustrated because they had reporters hanging outside their windows , climbing telephone poles , taking pictures of them at church , following them all over the place			0
" federal investigators in @entity7 hope modern technology will help solve the 1964 case , said @entity10 special agent @entity67			1
the @entity10 has a destruction schedule for old files , and agents were happy that the case file was n't on that schedule , she said			1
" we were n't sure if it was still around , but we were pleased to find it did exist , " @entity67 told @entity0			1
@entity67 declined to comment when asked if the agency felt any embarrassment about the reversal in the case			0
no one was ever charged in the 1964 kidnapping			2
" they conducted a thorough and complete investigation when it originally occurred , and we 'll do that again , " @entity67 said			1
" we now have technology and tests that we did n't have then , and we 're hoping this time around we 'll get that piece of information that will help us solve this case , either from evidence or witnesses			2
" @entity23 's parents , who are still alive , are cooperating with the @entity10 , but agents are concerned whether their dna would yield any matches in dna databases , @entity67 said			1
" if we take hair or fiber or dna from the victim 's side of the crime , we have to get to the other side of it to compare it to -- to find the persons who did the kidnapping , " @entity67 said			0
maybe new witnesses will come forward almost a half century later , @entity67 added			0
with the @entity10 's mandatory retirement age of 57 for agents , the original @entity7 @entity10 investigators would no longer be with the agency , she said			1
today 's investigators will concentrate on who was the kidnapper -- and not on what is @entity23 's real identity , @entity67 said			2
" our focus is on the crime that occurred , the kidnapping , " @entity67 said			0
" if in the course of the investigation we have information that will assist him in that , that will be an added benefit			0
" the reinvestigation of such a crime 49 years later is rare , she conceded			0
" there are always cold cases , " she said			0
but when talking about reopening a 1964 baby abduction case , she remarked , " it 's unusual			1
" @entity23 , who lives in @entity131 , @entity2 , with his wife , @entity133 , and daughter , @entity135 , said his name was @entity137 when he was found abandoned in 1965 at age 14 months			2
the people who became his parents , @entity141 and @entity142 of the @entity7 area , were able to take possession of him in june 1966 under the belief that the boy was indeed their child , @entity25 reported			1
the @entity148 adopted and renamed the boy , taking him into their @entity7 home			2
but as he grew older , @entity23 developed a hunch he did n't fit into the family			2
he did n't look like his @entity154 and @entity155 parents , who did n't reveal much about the kidnapping , he said			2
last year , @entity23 bought a home dna kit and took a swabbing from his parents while they were visiting from @entity7			1
a week later , the results of the test ruled out his being the biological son of @entity162 and @entity142 , he said			0
the dna technician told him that " there is no remote way that you are the @entity148 ' baby , " he said			0
" i thought , ' wow			0
' " he revealed his story to @entity25 just before what was supposed to be his 49th birthday in april			0
at the time , he said , he did n't even tell his adoptive parents what he learned because it was too agonizing			0
the @entity7 office of the @entity10 is now investigating the dual mystery of the kidnapped @entity23 baby and the abandoned @entity137 , with assistance from the agency 's @entity49 office , the tv station said			1
the original kidnapper in the @entity23 case was never found			0
neither @entity23 nor the @entity10 returned @entity0 's calls for comment thursday			1
since obtaining the dna findings , @entity23 submitted the results to @entity186 , a genealogy tracing company			0
based on his dna , @entity23 is discovering blood relatives : he 's found a third cousin , @entity25 reported			1
@entity0 's @entity191 contributed to this report .			0

@entity194 : " i believe that we will solve these 2 tragic mysteries , " @entity23 texts @entity0
new : @entity10 *pledges* " a thorough and complete investigation " into 1964 baby kidnapping
@entity23 , now 49 , tells @entity25 he was n't the kidnapped @entity7 baby
@entity23 wonders " how old i am , or who i am , or what nationality "
