-- @entity1 is jumping into its next futuristic hardware project			1
this time it 's a modular smartphone dubbed @entity4 that can be customized by swapping out individual pieces , such as the battery and the camera			1
the company previewed the very early - stage project at a developer event in @entity11 , @entity12 , this week			0
@entity1 said the first version of the phone will likely be available in early 2015			1
though the company did n't mention a sale price , it said the devices would cost anywhere from $ 50 to $ 500 to manufacture , depending on the model			0
the phone will come in three sizes , ranging from mini to " phablet , " and it will run on a future version of the @entity25 mobile operating system			0
a frame called the @entity27 will hold the interchangeable components together with magnets			0
the idea is to allow smartphone owners to customize and update their phones on their own -- say , popping out an old battery or broken display for a new version , and thereby creating a device that lasts longer than current smartphones			2
because the @entity4 project is open - source , the fun will be adding third - party modules or even printing your own with a 3d printer			2
instead of relying on a single hardware manufacturer , people could shop around and add unusual elements made by startups , cameras produced by camera companies , or custom hardware for highly specialized work phones			0
the modules will be sold much like apps are now , through a custom @entity1 online store and possibly even physical pop - up stores			2
an @entity4 device could be used for five to six years			2
that lengthy lifespan ( for a smartphone ) could cut down on electronic waste and shake up the planned obsolescence that seems common with current mobile gadgets			0
instead of dropping a still - working @entity63 for the @entity64 , you could just upgrade the parts you care about , like adding a fingerprint sensor or a better camera			0
@entity4 is the brainchild of @entity1 's @entity69 and projects group ( @entity70 )			1
when @entity1 bought @entity72 's mobile division for $ 2.9 billion , it also picked up @entity70 , its experimental lab where employees work on futuristic projects			1
@entity1 is already selling @entity76 to @entity77 , but it 's hanging on to @entity70 and its leader , former @entity79 director @entity78 .			1

@entity1 's @entity4 is a modular smartphone that allows you to swap out pieces
the phone is still in development but will be available in 2015
a modular smartphone could last much longer than a *traditional* phone
