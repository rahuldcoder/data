-- @entity2 's next president will have to work hand in hand with a complex bureaucratic structure that has been in a state of transition for the past three years			1
there are many serious security and socio - economic challenges , and there is no one person who can solve them alone			0
the success of the next president necessitates the full support and cooperation of the military , state bureaucracy and the majority of the population to be able to deliver to a polity with high expectations			1
at this juncture of @entity2 's @entity27 story , only former army chief @entity24 has emerged as a candidate who enjoys both the support of the state and the street			1
he has become a symbol of hope for millions of @entity2 , and does present an opportunity to move the country forward amidst difficult times			2
of course , his success is not guaranteed , but his strong connection to @entity2 's most influential institutions serves as a positive asset that sets him apart from other candidates			1
if elected , he will definitely be more capable than others in maneuvering through the multifaceted bureaucracy to get things done and undertake necessary tough decisions			0
for some @entity49 observers it is difficult to comprehend why people would mobilize behind a former military general			0
the reason behind this reality is simple ; the military institution remains the most respected and most popular state institution in the country			0
' disciplined strongman ' most @entity2 families have a loved - one who has served in the military , fostering a special bond between the people and its armed forces			1
three years of political transition , including a devastating year of @entity66 rule , prompted many @entity2 to long for a disciplined strongman who can guide the country towards security and stability			2
one of the core domestic constituencies behind @entity24 's presidential bid have been women and @entity74 , who actually suffered the most during the short - lived reign of the @entity66			1
thus nowadays , we see them more vocal and engaged in the political arena and in support of an @entity24 presidency			2
even the head of the @entity82 in @entity2 , @entity83 , has endorsed @entity24 's presidential bid , not surprising , especially after @entity66 supporters were blamed for attacks on scores of churches around the country as deadly clashes took place in @entity92 last august			1
the @entity66 itself said at the time that it did not support attacks on houses of worship			0
the strong backing of the @entity99 countries , foremost by @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , also strengthens the positive prospects of an @entity24 presidency			1
this significant regional support has provided international political backing and opened the door for new economic and security cooperation initiatives			0
we have already seen multi-billion dollar economic packages and an arms deal , and much more would follow after an election victory by @entity24			2
the @entity99 support has been key for the @entity2 armed forces and their ongoing efforts to combat terrorism in the @entity117 and to preserve national security			1
the issue of security has become the number one priority for @entity2 voters , and would pose the main challenge for an @entity24 presidency			1
however , his professional years in the intelligence community and military give him an edge over candidates who have never worked in the security apparatus			0
if @entity24 can not address nor solve the security threats facing @entity2 , then it is unlikely anyone else could			1
the odds are in favor of @entity24 , but it will not be an easy task with a defiant @entity66 that has rejected the current status quo			2
the violent path adopted by supporters of the @entity66 and its sister organizations can not win over the military and persuade the majority of @entity2 to turn back the clock			2
it has only succeeded in generating an ugly atmosphere by seeking to undermine the political system			0
they are violently contesting and expressing their political grievances , which will not change the new reality on the ground			0
opportunities for future in comparison with the political upheaval in @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , and other places in the @entity162 , @entity2 still seems better off			2
one thing is for sure ; that the inclusion of the @entity66 in the political system does not yield for a more stable political system , as demonstrated by their short stint in power			0
@entity2 's political transition towards a flourishing , consolidated democracy will take time			1
there will be many obstacles and setbacks on the way , but there are enormous opportunities for @entity2 's future			1
it only will be @entity2 who can determine their own domestic political destiny without outside interference , and they will never allow nor accept another @entity184 - like regime			0
the barrier of fear has been broken , and the first seeds of a pluralistic political society have been planted			0
@entity2 has changed and the rules of the political game have as well			0
an el - @entity192 presidency would have to be in tune to the new political dynamics in @entity2			0
so far , @entity24 has proven to be a leader who has been able to adapt to a fast - changing political environment			0
as defense minister and deputy prime minister , he was directly exposed to the serious challenges facing the country , making him fully aware of the magnitude of the task at hand			0
for many @entity2 , there is no alternative but @entity24 , he represents hope and the light at the end of the tunnel , but his success will depend on his ability to deliver			1

field marshal @entity24 has *resigned* from @entity2 's armed forces to run for president
@entity224 says @entity24 enjoys the support of the state and of the street
@entity24 's presidencial bid is strengthened by the support of @entity2 's @entity99 allies , he says
but @entity224 says @entity24 's success as president would still depend on his ability to deliver
