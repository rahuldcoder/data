-- at first glance , @entity3 artist @entity2 's spell - binding photographs could be mistaken for a set of stylish advertisements			1
it takes a moment to digest -- excuse the pun -- that you 're staring at pictures of rotting food			1
among them , a pineapple hangs suspended in negative space above an antique gold dish -- its formerly yellow flesh having given way to luminous green mold ; @entity21 beetroots sit snugly in an elegant porcelain vase with thin films of gray fur accumulating on their skin			0
the idea is simple : " to expose the contradiction between the beauty of food products -- particularly as presented in the media -- and the ugly reality of overconsumption and waste , " explained @entity2			1
the title of his new series -- " @entity38 " -- derives from a 2011 @entity41 @entity40 report			1
it revealed a chilling statistic : a third of all food products worldwide go uneaten			1
depending on the type of food in question , this figure ranges from between 25 % and 75 % and , altogether , it amounts to 1.3 billion tons of edible goods discarded each year			1
in a world where approximately 925 million people suffer chronic hunger , the overarching moral implications are stark			0
but the less documented environmental consequences are almost as alarming			0
according to a @entity60 report , the food industry is responsible for creating up to 30 % of the world 's total annual carbon emissions			1
" the dominant food production system is based on fossil fuel at every level , " said dr @entity63 , professor of food and @entity65 at @entity67 's @entity66			2
" it needs oil to make the fertilizer , oil for the farm , oil for the food processing , oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops			2
" read related : futuristic farm shop grows food in synthetic veg patch but wasted food does n't just entail all the embedded carbon released during production and transportation			1
it generates more emissions once it 's discarded on the trash heap			2
" a significant percentage of the household food that is wasted ends up in landfill , where it produces @entity100 and methane gas , " explained @entity92 , director of waste prevention at the @entity95 - based @entity94 ( @entity94 )			1
" methane is 23 times more potent than co2 as a greenhouse gas , " he added			2
as such , @entity94 calculates that every ton of food and drink wasted roughly equates to 3.8 tons of greenhouse gas emissions that could otherwise have been avoided			1
" applying this factor to the quantity of food waste in the @entity95 , leads to an estimated 17 million tons of co2 in 2010 -- the equivalent to the emissions of 1 in 5 cars on our roads , " said @entity92			1
and yet a recent study revealed that up to 40 % of food thrown away by consumers in @entity120 is still in its original packaging when it lands in the dustbin			2
this all begs the question : why do we squander so much ? @entity2 says that the high - end , fashion magazine finish of his images reflect what he sees as the " over-commoditization " of food as a lifestyle accessory			1
" with countless cookery shows and ever more seductive advertisements , food has become a major part of the culture industry , " he said			1
" this , along with the false economy of discount bulk buys , is part of why people are purchasing more than they can use			0
" it 's a peculiarly @entity143 phenomenon , " he added			0
dr @entity144 is senior scientist in environmental systems at the @entity146 -- the body commissioned by the @entity40 to coordinate its food waste report			1
he agrees with @entity2 that the problem is symptomatic of the @entity151 's culture of cheap disposable goods			0
his research found , perhaps unsurprisingly , that in @entity120 and @entity155 , each consumer wastes between 95 and 115 kilograms of food a year , whilst only 6 to 11 kilograms of edible goods are discarded per person in @entity159 and @entity160			2
these numbers do n't reveal the full extent of the disparity			0
@entity144 notes that the majority of uneaten food in places like @entity159 is created at the point of production , largely as a consequence of things like spoiled crops or poor refrigeration			1
in contrast , supply - side practices have become more efficient in wealthy industrialized nations , according to @entity144 , but consumers have become much less diligent : " we throw away more food than ever before , " he said			2
@entity144 contends that the problem boils down to basic economic logic			0
he says that , despite some recent commodity fluctuations , the price of food in industrialized nations continues to drop , so there 's less incentive to think about what 's in the fridge , or make an effort to avoid cooking more than we need			2
" as a result , today we have less knowledge about cooking and food preparation ... my parents and grandparents knew how to make use of everything , " he said			2
what would it take to wind back the clock ? @entity92 thinks that it would only require a series of relatively small behavioral modifications : " for instance , just taking five minutes to go through your store cupboard and fridge before making a shopping list can stop you wasting money buying ingredients you may already have			0
" or , when you get home with your shopping , transfer as much as you can straight into the freezer			0
if you have large packets of chicken pieces or fish , divide them up and freeze individual portions ... there 's loads of simple , easy things like this that you can do			0
" but it 's not just consumers who are at fault			0
@entity2 says that supermarkets are guilty of discarding large quantities of food for seemingly frivolous reasons			0
" there 's a tendency for supermarkets to put pressure on food producers to supply them with ' perfect ' products			1
this pressure is to blame for the common practice of goods being discarded and destroyed immediately after harvest because of minor imperfections , " he said			0
" furthermore , it 's not unusual for supermarket chains to purposely acquire a surplus of food , so shelves can remain fully stocked with perishable items -- pastries , meat , fruit and vegetables -- right until closing time , " he said			0
farm in the city could be supermarket of the future but the tides might be turning			0
@entity92 points out that , although a long - time coming , people in some nations are finally waking up to the seriousness of the issue			0
he points out that in 2007 , the @entity95 wasted 8.3 million tons of food , but by 2010 that figure had dropped to 7.2 million			1
only time will tell if the rest of the industrialized world will follow suit .			0
