@entity0 , @entity1 in front of me was utter chaos -- angry , screaming fans			1
but there were scared , scurrying fans , too			0
above a helicopter hovered over the @entity10 , the venue of thursday 's @entity13 semifinal between @entity1 and @entity14			1
for about 12 hours before the game kicked off , that dark blue and yellow chopper had been pacing the skies around the stadium , as if it had a premonition as to what would happen that night			2
" i 've never played in front of anything like that and i 'd like to say sorry on behalf of my team			0
it was an odd experience -- one i 've never felt before , " said @entity1 star @entity26 after his team lost 3 - 0			1
the host nation 's fans started the match with hopes of @entity1 making its first ever @entity13 final , before they started grumbling when decisions did n't go their way			1
ahead of kick off the mood had been one of optimism			0
earlier the country 's state owned @entity40 @entity43 had taken calls on its build up show and every one of the 35 callers had predicted a 2 - 0 win or more for @entity1			1
. that might partly explain why the home fans became so angry			2
the weird @entity14 's third goal -- scored by captain @entity51 -- was the cue for the missile throwing and pelting to intensify			1
but amid the madness , there was also humanity			0
" we shall protect you , " said @entity57 , a middle - aged man clad in the red jersey of the @entity59 , as the home team are affectionately called			2
" if they try to come near you we will hit them with this , " he said with a grunt as he lifted a metal barricade with @entity64 emblazoned on it , before adding that he was disgusted by the " stupidity of some of the fans			0
" @entity1 was the first @entity13 host nation to reach the semifinals since @entity14 did it in 2008 and perhaps there was a sense that a final appearance on sunday was preordained			1
" but that does not give you the right to beat people who have come to play good football , does it ? " said an exasperated @entity57 , as he tried to call the attention of the police to two men in the crowd shaking their fists and making menacing gestures at the @entity83 journalists in the press box			2
then the smoke bombs and tear gas started flying , with the @entity92 characterizing the scenes as a " like a war zone			2
" going outside @entity57 was n't the only local to make it their business to help out			0
" there were four guys from the street who just saw my friends and i and decided to help us , " said @entity98 , sporting a cut to her left eye from a rock thrown at her group of girls wearing bright @entity14 - themed dresses			1
" they made us take off our dresses and they gave us their shirts			0
we wore their @entity1 jerseys and they walked on the road bare chested so we were able to get back to the @entity115 safely			1
" while the @entity14 @entity118 president @entity117 called the actions of fans " barbaric " and " uncivilized , " he also acknowledged the efforts of the " very few good men who opted to help us			1
" video : see the chopper flying literally above the stands			0
this one na movie oh ! # afcon2015 pic.twitter.com / @entity126 disappointment and then ... hope returning to my hotel i found it filled with people from the stadium who could n't go home because of the chaotic nature of the streets			0
as i was going back to my room , a familiar face walked in			0
" @entity139 ! " it was @entity57 , who was volunteering to help with the transportation needs of any stranded @entity83 fans			0
@entity1 can expect some unfavorable headlines in the coming days and weeks , but the unheralded helpers show that @entity146 football -- and @entity146 -- is not all that bad .			2

thursday 's @entity13 was *overshadowed* by *violence* in the stadium
hosts @entity1 were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity14 , prompting angry scenes
@entity14 will play @entity154 in sunday 's final
