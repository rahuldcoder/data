-- from buying expensive caskets and tailoring new clothes to slaughtering animals and organizing a massive feast , little expense is spared in @entity7 's elaborate funeral celebrations			1
here , as in other communities across @entity7 , the financial and social resources invested in funerals are matched by no other rite of passage			1
" in the west , marriages are often the biggest life - cycle events			0
in @entity7 , it 's funerals by far , " said professor @entity16 , co-editor of " funerals in @entity7 : explorations of a @entity21			1
" @entity16 explains that such large events , designed to pay respect to the dead and honor one 's roots , also provide a kind of " social glue " for communities in many @entity31 societies : they are at the heart of social and cultural life , with status concerns , succession issues and family bonds also at stake			0
yet , honoring those who 've passed away can also exact a huge financial toll on the already emotionally vulnerable relatives			1
in @entity7 , bereaved families often have to spend significant amounts to host lavish funerals and burial ceremonies			1
they are expected to host and feed extended relatives who visit from all over the country and can stay for weeks			0
other costs include slaughtering a cow or a goat to honor the dead , renting hearse tents and arranging transportation to the burial ground for mourners			1
" in many areas , a lot of people spend a lot of money on funerals			1
sometimes , it 's out of choice for reasons of status , but other times , it 's simply out of the social pressure , and it is certainly putting burdens on people when they do n't have a lot of money , " said @entity16			0
a 2009 report by economists @entity71 and @entity73 found that the average price tag for an " honorable " funeral in @entity7 between 2003 and 2005 was about 3,400 rand ( $ 415 ) , which is equivalent to 40 % of the average annual household expenditure			2
the report said that funeral expenses leave surviving family members vulnerable to future hardship , with spending on items such as food and clothes significantly lower following the funeral			2
children in households that experienced a death are also less likely to be enrolled in school , while adults are much more likely to report problems such as symptoms of depression and periods of anxiety			0
" the costs of food are enormous			2
the coffins are extremely expensive , " said @entity97			0
" a family might spend as much money on a coffin as they will spend on their children 's school fees for all of the period that their children are at school			0
" in @entity109 , where funerals are often boisterous events of great size and importance , families tend to channel vast amount of resources and time in the memorials			2
one example is ordering custom - built coffins in just about any design shape that either are symbolic or reflect the deceased 's profession			0
@entity109 's incredible coffins : fish , bananas and buses in @entity127 , a 2004 study published in the @entity126 found that 63 % of households that declined into poverty in rural areas cited heavy funeral costs as a reason			2
in @entity135 , @entity16 says , people at times would opt for saving money for a funeral instead of contributing for medical costs while a person is still alive			2
" people know that these funerals can be so expensive that they 'll actually save money for that and spend it on that rather than health expenses that could actually keep the person alive longer , " he said			1
a financial instrument that has evolved in @entity7 to help people prepare for funerals are savings clubs or accounts that pay out only upon death			1
individuals usually belong to a burial society or pay weekly or monthly installments for insurance that guarantees that some expenses incurred for their funerals will be paid for by the insurer			2
however , most times , the funds from these plans are not enough , forcing families to turn elsewhere for assistance			0
" the households are really left scrambling , " said @entity162 , co-author of " @entity163 : how the @entity165 on $ 2 a day " and director at @entity167			0
" the lion 's share is paid for by the relatives , but what 's hidden underneath that is that , oftentimes , what comes from the relatives is not quite enough , so there 's quite a bit of borrowing from either friends or money lenders , " she added			1
as a result , nearly a quarter of households have no choice but to borrow money , according to case and @entity188 's study , with money lenders charging exorbitant monthly interest rates of 30 % or more			1
@entity191 , who built the @entity192 and @entity194 funeral parlor in @entity195 to help fellow @entity196 bury their dead back home , says that funerals are creating a big financial burden for poor households			1
" it costs you , you go and borrow money , you have to pay back to repay the money after the funeral , so it means your life will be affected most probably for the whole year for a single death , " said @entity191			0
inside his parlor , a relative of a deceased man agrees : " it is expensive because we have to donate			0
each and every member of the family has to donate so that we can manage to take him home			0

funerals in @entity7 create a big financial burden for poor families
expenses include buying coffins , providing food and arranging for transportation
the costs of funerals are shared by the relatives but they *'re* still difficult to bear
in many cases , families turn to money lenders to cover the costs
