the @entity1 and the @entity4 " stand with the people of @entity3 " in their fight for the right to choose alliances with countries other than @entity10 , @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 said saturday			1
his comments come after a week of political tumult in which @entity3 's prime minister and @entity16 have resigned , a controversial anti-protest law has been repealed and the president has signed off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters			1
" nowhere is the fight for a democratic , @entity24 future more important today than in @entity3 , " said @entity0 , speaking at the @entity20 in @entity21			1
" while there are unsavory elements in any chaotic situation , the vast majority of @entity3 want to live freely in a safe , prosperous country			2
they are fighting for the right to associate with partners who will help them realize their aspirations -- and they have decided that means their futures do not have to lie with one country alone			0
" the @entity1 and @entity4 stand with the people of @entity3 in that fight			1
" the protesters have been in @entity41 's @entity40 , or @entity40 , since november , when president @entity42 reversed a decision to sign a long - awaited trade deal with the @entity4 and turned instead toward @entity10			1
the government 's attempts to crack down on protests appear only to have strengthened the opposition 's resolve			2
violent confrontations flared after the anti-protest law was signed two weeks ago , followed by an uneasy standoff on the streets as the battle in the political arena has heated up			0
@entity0 also had a word of advice for @entity58 , which has accused @entity59 of meddling in @entity3 's affairs while denying itself exerting undue influence on @entity41			1
" @entity10 and other countries should not view the @entity24 integration of their neighbors as a zero - sum game , " @entity0 said			1
" in fact , the lesson of the last half - century is that we can accomplish much more when the @entity1 , @entity10 and @entity59 work together			1
but make no mistake : we will continue to speak out when our interests or values are undercut by any country in the region			0
" @entity0 added that while @entity1 democracy was " a work in progress , " he was not going to shy away from calling out " a disturbing trend in too many parts of @entity80 and @entity59 and the @entity81 " where people 's aspirations " are once again being trampled beneath corrupt , oligarchic interests			1
" after his address , @entity0 met with three @entity3 opposition leaders -- @entity88 of the @entity89 , @entity90 of the @entity92 party and @entity93 of the " @entity95 " street protest movement -- the @entity87 said			1
' @entity96 is on our side ' @entity99 president @entity98 also highlighted events in @entity3 as he opened the second day of the conference saturday			1
" today @entity3 is on all our minds , " he said			2
" as people across the country are taking to the streets , @entity3 's political destiny is still in the balance			2
" @entity98 said he and @entity109 president @entity108 had had " a frank exchange " with @entity114 this week at an @entity4 - @entity10 summit in @entity111 , @entity112			1
" we answered his concerns about the impact on @entity10 of closer economic ties between @entity3 and @entity59			1
we also pressed the point of the rights of independent countries , " he said			0
" whatever the geopolitics , we have offered @entity3 a closer association with the @entity4 , the countries to its west			2
not for free , but upon conditions -- which were close to fulfilled			0
and not against the great neighboring nation to its east , with which it shares a history and culture			0
" the offer is still there			0
and we know time is on our side			0
the future of @entity3 belongs with the @entity4			2
" but @entity10 foreign minister @entity136 presented a rather different take in his remarks to the conference			1
" what does incitement of increasingly violent street protests have to do with promoting democracy , " he asked			0
" why do n't we hear condemnation of those who seize and hold government buildings , attack the police , torch the police , use racist and anti-semitic and @entity151 slogans ? he suggested @entity24 politicians were encouraging @entity3 actions that they would punish as violations of the law in their own countries			1
@entity136 also said the @entity1 and the @entity4 appeared to be trying to push their own ideas on @entity3			1
" freedom of choice is being imposed , and @entity10 is not going to engage in this , " he said			0
torture claims meanwhile , @entity3 's opposition parties continue to call for constitutional reforms to shift power away from the president			2
they say the new amnesty bill -- which only comes into force if protesters vacate seized government buildings and unblock roads and squares -- is unacceptable			0
@entity42 , who has been out on sick leave since thursday , has resisted calls for him to stand down and defended the government 's handling of the political crisis			0
on friday , @entity178 leaders voiced growing concern over reports of the kidnap and torture of opposition activists in @entity3			1
one , the visibly battered @entity184 , reappeared thursday , more than a week after he went missing			0
he told reporters he 'd been kidnapped and tortured by his captors -- who , he claimed , " crucified me " by piercing his hands -- before being dumped in a forest			0
both @entity4 foreign policy chief @entity191 and @entity193 press secretary @entity192 condemned his cruel treatment			0
" we are deeply concerned by increasing reports of protesters disappearing and being beaten and tortured , as well as by attacks on journalists , " @entity192 said			0
" it is especially concerning that some of these reports have suggested the involvement of security forces			0
" @entity3 's @entity205 has said it is investigating what happened to @entity184			2
@entity3 , a former @entity207 republic , is home to 45 million people			0
the clashes earlier this month were an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by @entity42 's decision in november to spurn a planned trade deal with the @entity4 and turn toward @entity10			2
he and @entity114 agreed on a $ 15 billion deal for @entity10 to buy @entity3 debt and slash the price of natural gas .			1
