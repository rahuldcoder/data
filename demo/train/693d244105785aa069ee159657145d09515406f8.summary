the islamic state terror group is now " a credible alternative to @entity4 " that is " expanding its presence " with foreign fighters returning from @entity7 , and possibly @entity8 , to their home countries , a @entity1 intelligence official said thursday			1
the official , who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information , has direct knowledge of the latest intelligence on the group , also known as @entity16 or @entity16			0
according to an assessment , the group has grown in size since the spring and its takeover of @entity21 in northern @entity8 as more fighters from around the world have mainly traveled to @entity7 to join its ranks			0
the @entity1 believes that while the group remains largely focused on its brutal takeover of large areas of @entity8 , there is also an " expansion of its external terrorist ambitions			0
" some foreign fighters are returning to their home countries with orders to " start new cells " of terrorist activity , the official said			1
what to know about @entity16 while some members may have a desire to attack the @entity1 , the group 's leadership is still focused on establishing an @entity43 caliphate			2
still , they " see conflict with the @entity1 as inevitable , " the official said			0
the @entity1 believes a deadly shooting at @entity49 's @entity48 in may by an alleged @entity16 loyalist may be the kind of attack that could happen more often in western countries , possibly including the @entity1			1
@entity1 law enforcement is watching a small number of @entity1 for possible affiliation with the group			1
how @entity16 is overshadowing @entity4 @entity16 foreign fighters may be operating somewhat independently of the organization 's hierarchy , which the @entity1 believes maintains lines of authority and even succession plans			1
the intelligence community is now updating its assessment of how many fighters may be loyal to the group , and the number could be more than 10,000 , the official said			1
@entity16 has taken advantage of the momentum it gained in @entity8 over the past several months , resulting in a large number of new fighters joining up			2
map : where is @entity16 ? while it currently has funds from taking over oil facilities and other operations in @entity8 , the @entity1 believes that will not be enough to sustain @entity16 if it tries to seize the entire country , the official said			2
the @entity1 also is watching closely to see whether and at what point @entity16 loses support from @entity84 loyalists in @entity8			1
the @entity1 calculation is that @entity16 is taking advantage of its recent momentum			2
because it is seen as " successful " in many areas , including @entity90 and @entity91 where @entity4 affiliates operate , they have gained support from some jihadists more widely			0
who is the @entity16 ? in those areas , they also remain at odds with the core of @entity4 in @entity100 led by @entity101 and several of affiliates			0
the thinking is as momentum slows , @entity16 will be " under more pressure , reality sets in , " the official said			0
" we do n't see the group as 10 feet tall			0

the @entity111 , also known as @entity16 , is expanding its presence , official said
fighters loyal to @entity16 could number more than 10,000 with some returning home countries
law enforcement is watching a small number of @entity1 for possible affiliation
the @entity1 is watching to see if @entity16 loses support from other @entity84
