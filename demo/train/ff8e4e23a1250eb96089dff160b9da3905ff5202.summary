model and tv personality @entity0 is usually one of @entity3 's more resilient members			1
but after getting lost in a " sea of hate and anger " on the platform , @entity0 has tapped out			2
the 28 - year - old turned into a @entity3 all - star after she joined in 2009 , thanks to her irreverent sense of humor , prolific use and ability to tweet about pretty much anything			2
but after getting a vitriolic response to her comments regarding the october 22 shootings in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity0 posted that she 's quitting @entity3 for the ( presumably ) safer pastures of @entity22			1
here 's what started it all : on wednesday , as the shooting story unfolded , @entity0 posted : " active shooting in @entity27 , or as we call it in @entity29 , wednesday			1
that 's not a joke			2
... i 've lost faith in this world			0
sorry if it comes off as being unemotional			0
there is just so much bad			0
" it seems the negative reaction fell on @entity0 pretty quickly , as she then had to clarify that she was not making a joke at the expense of @entity27 , but as a sardonic observation about gun control in @entity29			1
( incidentally , it was just days before the @entity47 , @entity48 , school shooting			0
) however , that clarification apparently did n't change the tide of response @entity0 received			1
" you should probably stick to having your picture taken for a living , " replied one user			0
" so , how much of an stupid bitch are you ? " asked another			0
at one point , @entity0 posted a photo of the responses she was getting on @entity3 , suggesting the platform should be more proactive about stomping out threatening tweets			1
by october 23 , @entity0 was officially over @entity3			1
" i ca n't see anything through the sea of hate and anger that is now my @entity3			2
seriously i ca n't sift through it all , " @entity0 said			2
" it 's gotten to the point people do n't even see ( t ) he simplicity of the original tweet and have just wanted to get shaking - mad over something			0
" after sharing one more threatening message , this time from a @entity3 user who hoped that " someone murders some ( one ) you love , like your f * * * * t husband , " @entity0 posted what sounds like her final tweet -- at least for now			1
" i feel sick , " she said			0
taking my talents to @entity22			0
