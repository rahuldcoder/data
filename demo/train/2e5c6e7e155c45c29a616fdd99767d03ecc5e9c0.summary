-- president @entity3 's commission investigating last year 's oil disaster is giving environmental groups hope that some change is on the horizon , but not the full scope of what they 're looking for , two groups told @entity0 thursday			1
" if you take the findings to heart , you would n't start drilling again , " said @entity11 , research director with @entity12			1
on wednesday , the @entity17 on the @entity18 and @entity19 released a chapter of its coming report , saying " systemic " problems caused the blowout and that only " significant reform " would prevent another			1
" the macondo blowout was the product of several individual missteps and oversights by @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 , which government regulators lacked the authority , the necessary resources , and the technical expertise to prevent , " the report says			1
@entity38 was the name of the well			0
@entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 all were involved in the drilling operation			0
@entity12 and the @entity42 told @entity0 there were no surprises in the released chapter			1
" it kind of confirms our worst fears that we 've had about the oil industry all along -- that they cut corners where they can , " said @entity46 , director of lands protection with the @entity42			2
" and that sometimes threatens the safety and operation of their rigs			0
" @entity46 said he believes the president will take the commission 's findings seriously			0
" administratively , we 're confident that the @entity3 administration will change the way oil companies do business in the @entity65			0
" but , he said , his group is not holding out hope for major legislative change			2
" i imagine that the @entity69 in charge of the @entity71 , and now the new speaker , do n't want to see any new restrictions on the oil industry , " he said			1
@entity12 's @entity11 said the chapter released " puts an exclamation point on the fact that the corporations were at fault , " though he noted that a lack of government oversight also is to blame			1
" what we hope is that the commission 's recommendations are taken to heart by the president , " he said			0
but @entity11 added , " we do n't have very high hopes for the reforms that should happen -- a massive overhaul of the regulatory apparatus and oversight			1
" " ultimately , " he said , " i think the oil industry will succeed in blocking things like that			2
" the group @entity96 also weighed in with a statement , saying the early draft indicates the commission " will recommend important reforms			1
" the group added , " we now look to the government and industry to step up to the plate			1
" the @entity105 , the main group representing the oil industry , told @entity0 thursday it did not yet have a response to the chapter released by the commission			1
@entity32 issued a response , accusing the commission of having " selectively omitted information we provided to them			0
" the company also disagreed with certain specifics , saying the report mischaracterized foam stability tests			2
@entity33 issued a statement saying its crew had taken " appropriate actions to gain control of the well			0
they were well trained and considered to be among the best in the business			0
" @entity31 spokesman @entity125 said wednesday the oil giant " has cooperated fully with the commission 's investigation , " stressing that " the accident was the result of multiple causes , involving multiple companies			0
" " @entity31 is working with regulators and the industry to ensure that the lessons learned from @entity38 lead to improvements in operations and contractor services in deepwater drilling , " @entity125 said			2
the @entity141 @entity140 said it , too , is already implementing reforms			0
" the agency has taken unprecedented steps and will continue to make the changes necessary to restore the @entity141 people 's confidence in the safety and environmental soundness of oil and gas drilling and production on the @entity153 , while balancing our nation 's important energy needs , " spokeswoman @entity143 said .			0
