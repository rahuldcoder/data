-- the historic vessel which provided the setting for @entity4 's only oscar winning performance has been resurrected from the scrapheap by a movie - loving @entity7 couple			1
the african queen is a 100 year old steam boat famed for its starring role in the 1951 hit movie of the same name			1
the classic picture -- which also starred @entity15 and told the story of a @entity18 steam boat captain and a @entity20 missionary working in @entity21 during the @entity22 -- saw @entity4 receive the 1951 @entity23 for best actor			1
after falling into a state of disrepair following the death of its previous owner in 2001 , the vessel was spotted gathering rust in a @entity7 marina late last year by @entity32 and her engineer husband , @entity33			1
the couple have since repaired the ailing ship and opened it up to tourists and film enthusiasts , providing cruises around the @entity39 aboard the famous vessel			1

" we have a tall ship business that operates right next to where the african queen was stationed in @entity52			1
it was just wasting away so we offered to restore it and put it into our charter operation , " she adds			0
although most famed for its role alongside @entity4 and @entity15 , the @entity50 had a long and colorful life before hitting the big screen , explains @entity32			1
built in 1912 at @entity63 in @entity64 , the vessel was originally named the @entity65 and served as a cargo vessel for the @entity67			2
it spent most of its first 50 years operating in the waters of the @entity71 in the northern @entity72 where she was used to transport a mixture of hunters , mercenaries and cargo			0
in the early 1950 's the ship was spotted by the director of the @entity50 , @entity80 , and pulled temporarily from service so it could be used in the movie			2

an @entity90 businessman transported the ship to the @entity93 city where he hoped to harness its @entity95 fame to operate it as a tour boat			2
this idea proved unsuccessful however and the vessel then changed hands a number of times before coming to the attention of @entity7 attorney and @entity4 enthusiast , @entity105 in 1982			1
@entity105 eagerly snapped up his very own chunk @entity4 movie memorabilia which he owned until his death in 2001			1
during this period @entity105 took the @entity50 around the world , gracing flotillas that marked the 50th anniversary of the battle of @entity113 in the @entity114 and the @entity116 's 90th birthday on the @entity117			0
once @entity105 passed away however , the vessel once more fell upon hard times , wasting away on a lonely jetty in southern @entity7			1
it was here that @entity32 , herself a self - confessed @entity4 and @entity15 buff recognized the boat			1
late last year she made an offer to the owners to put it back in working order			2
" it had big holes in it and was kind of like a sieve when it rained , all the water was just pouring out , " says @entity32			0
" my husband has restored big boats before , some bigger than this one , so i knew that we could do it , " she adds			0
the ensuing restoration project has been a detailed and thorough process taking fully six months to complete			0

in order to maintain the boats worn and rustic charm however , @entity32 says it has been splattered with mud so as to make it look exactly like it does in the movie			0
" most of the interest so far in boat has come from movie fans ... so we wanted it to make it look as much like it does in the film as possible , " says @entity32			1
the ship has even had a special guest visitor in the shape of @entity4 's son , @entity165 , who gave the freshly completed restoration efforts his blessing			2
but by using the @entity50 's @entity95 past to draw people aboard , @entity32 also hopes to provide visitors with an understanding of the ship 's rich history beyond the silver screen			0
this a story @entity32 herself says she has been fascinated to discover over the course of the past few months			0
" i knew it was famous from the movie but as time has gone on i 've found out a lot more about the history of it and where she has been , " says @entity32			0
" hopefully we 'll be able to relay that story and all those who come to visit can learn a little more about the boat and her incredible life , " she adds .			0
