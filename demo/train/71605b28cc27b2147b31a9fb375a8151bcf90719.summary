@entity0 -- the unfolding saga of the @entity4 co-owner @entity3 touches upon big , explosive issues in @entity7 society : racism			1
@entity3 , an attorney and billionaire real estate mogul , is now fighting to keep his co-ownership of the @entity15 franchise after the league said it would ban him forever in the wake of allegations that he disparaged african - americans in an audio recording			1
the @entity3 controversy contains as many surprises and exchanges as the ongoing @entity15 playoffs , which , by the way , still include the @entity4 in contention for the league title			1
in fact , on thursday , the attorney for @entity3 's wife , the other co-owner , told @entity1 that she 's distancing herself from her husband and has informed the @entity15 she wants the team in her name			1
how the scandal began last month , @entity15 commissioner @entity36 announced the league was imposing a lifetime ban and a $ 2.5 million fine against @entity3 , co-owner of the @entity4 since 1981 , for " offensive and disturbing " remarks he made about blacks			1
those remarks were uttered in an audio recording published by the celebrity news outlet @entity44 , which asserted the two people talking on the tape were @entity3 and his " girlfriend , " @entity48			1
@entity44 has n't stated who made the recording or how it was obtained			2
but @entity36 said the @entity4 owner " acknowledged it was his voice on the tape			2
" @entity1 has n't independently confirmed the audio recording			1
@entity3 and @entity48 have n't returned @entity1 's calls for comment			1
in a recent interview with @entity60 's @entity59 , however , @entity48 tacitly confirmed the authenticity of the recording when she stated she and @entity3 often discussed race : " there 's been a number of occasions where mr. @entity3 and i had conversations just like this one			1
" in the recording , @entity3 argues with @entity48 about how she posted to @entity70 a photo with legendary @entity15 player @entity72			1
" in your lousy f * * ing @entity74 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " @entity3 says			1
" if it 's white people , it 's ok ? " the woman responds			0
" if it was @entity83 , would it make a difference ? " @entity83 was also a @entity15 star who played with the @entity85 and a storied rival of @entity72 , who played for the @entity87			0
" i 've known [ @entity88 ] well and he should be admired ...			0
i 'm just saying that it 's too bad you ca n't admire him privately , " the man on the recording says			1
" admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put [ @entity88 ] on an @entity70 for the world to have to see so they have to call me			0
and do n't bring him to my games			0
" when the woman says she does n't share the man 's views about race , he tells her : " well , then , if you do n't feel -- do n't come to my games			1
do n't bring black people , and do n't come			0
" @entity48 's response in her only substantial interview , @entity48 , 31 , told @entity60 that @entity3 , 80 , is now hurting			1
emotionally traumatized , " @entity48 said			0
about her relationship with @entity3 , @entity48 said she plays a big role in his life , but they are not romantically involved			2
" i love him just like a father figure , " she told @entity60			0
she also described herself as his " right - hand man , " " confidant , " and " best friend			0
" they also have a financial arrangement , she said			0
" he at first started paying me as an employee , and then he started paying me off the books , " she said			0
her attorney , @entity119 , said @entity48 was a platonic friend of @entity3 's and not his " girlfriend " or , as some media outlets , including @entity1 , put it , his " mistress			1
" " they were more like friends			0
@entity126 , " @entity119 told @entity1			2
@entity48 is writing about book about her life , but she does n't have a book deal connected to the @entity3 controversy , @entity119 said			1
even before the racial controversy erupted , @entity3 's wife , @entity131 , was well aware of @entity48			1
in fact , in march , @entity133 sued @entity48 , accusing her of having an affair with her husband and targeting extremely wealthy older men			0
@entity48 's attorney dismissed as " absolutely false " any description of @entity48 as a " gold digger " and a " con artist			2
" @entity133 's suit claims that her husband used the couple 's money to buy @entity48 a @entity145 , two @entity146 and a @entity147			2
@entity48 also took over a $ 1.8 million duplex through fraud and received about $ 250,000 in cash from @entity3 , the court document claims			2
@entity48 is fighting back , saying in another court document that there was nothing wrong with @entity3 giving her gifts			2
she also says she never took advantage of him			0
@entity3 's response @entity3 had largely been silent on the controversy			1
the only significant comment he made was published last week on @entity160 , which quoted @entity3 as saying " i wish i had just paid her off " in reference to @entity48			2
the website specified that @entity3 was referring to @entity48 in a discussion with one of its writers , but the publication did n't state when the remark was made			1
@entity1 could n't independently confirm the remark			1
on thursday , however , another celebrity news outlet , @entity171 , published a new audio recording of @entity3 conversing with an unknown man about allegations of @entity3 being a racist			1
@entity3 emphatically denies being a racist in the conversation			2
" you think i 'm a racist ? " @entity3 tells a person @entity171 calls " a long - time friend in the recorded phone conversation			1
" " you think i have anything in the world but love for everybody ? you do n't think that ! you know i 'm not a racist ! " @entity3 says on the recording			1
" i grew up in @entity190 ... " @entity3 continues			2
" i was the president of the high school there			0
i mean , and i 'm a @entity192 ! and 50 % of the people there were black and 40 % were @entity195			0
... so i mean , people must have a good feeling for me			0
" @entity1 could n't independently confirm the new audio recording			1
@entity171 said it obtained " a secret audio recording " from an unidentified source who also provided an affidavit confirming the phone call was made by @entity203			1
@entity3 also declares in the recording that he wo n't sell his co-ownership in the @entity4 as the @entity15 is now demanding			1
" you ca n't force people to sell property in @entity7 , " @entity3 says			1
at one point in the conversation , @entity3 sounds bewildered when the friend tells him that rapper - producer @entity212 is among the celebrities seeking to buy the @entity4			1
friend : " i 'm just saying they got @entity216 ... @entity3 : " who ? " friend : " @entity216 and @entity219			2
" what 's next for the @entity4 the " @entity219 " cited on the recording is @entity219 , who is among a long list of public figures reportedly seeking to buy the @entity4 , one of 30 teams in the @entity15			1
other interested celebrities include @entity227 , ranked by @entity228 as one of the highest - paid athletes in the world ; former boxing champion @entity232 ; basketball great @entity72 ; producer - musician dr. @entity234 ; rapper @entity235 ; music mogul @entity236 ; @entity238 co-founder @entity237 ; @entity239 , a real estate developer and @entity0 civic leader ; and actors @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245			0
meanwhile , @entity133 has no intention of surrendering her stake in the team and has been in touch with the @entity15 about keeping the team , according to her attorney , @entity251 , who spoke thursday to @entity1			2
@entity133 owns 50 % of the team , and her husband the other 50 % , through a family trust , @entity251 said			0
@entity251 asserted that as of now , " she 's the owner in charge			0
" the couple continue to share properties , he added			0
but the @entity203 have been estranged and not living together for more than a year , @entity251 said			0
moreover , @entity133 is now distancing herself from the racist comments attributed to her husband , @entity251 said			0
" mrs. @entity133 has denounced in the strongest terms possible terms her husband 's racist comments , " @entity251 said			0
whether @entity133 can keep the team in her name is being robustly discussed by analysts			0
complicating the matter is how @entity3 intends to fight the forced sale , according to the @entity171 recording			2
@entity3 could be forced to sell his team if three - quarters of the @entity15 team owners agree , @entity269 said			0
@entity1 legal analyst @entity273 said that for all practical purposes , the @entity15 effort to make @entity3 sell the team also applies to his wife			1
" they 're the same ownership group			0
that is not separate ownership , " @entity273 said			0
as for the @entity4 ' more immediate prospects , the team is now tied 1 - 1 with the @entity283 in a best - of - seven - games playoff series			0
both teams are vying to advance to the @entity287 playoffs , whose winner will play for the league title against the @entity292 winner			0
the @entity294 's next game is friday night at home , though the team 's off - court drama is proving to be equally compelling			0
@entity1 's @entity298 and @entity299 contributed to this report .			2
