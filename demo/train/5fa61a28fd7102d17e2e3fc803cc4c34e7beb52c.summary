@entity0 must prepare for life without one its greatest ever players after captain @entity4 confirmed he will leave the club at the end of the 2014 - 2015 season			1
" this has been the toughest decision of my life and one which both me and my family have agonized over for a good deal of time , " @entity4 , who has played 695 times for @entity0 , told the club 's website			1
" i am making the announcement now so that the manager and the team are not distracted by stories or speculation about my future			0
" @entity4 will continue playing football -- but not in the @entity25 -- and @entity27 journalist @entity26 has reported that @entity29 club @entity28 are interested in signing the @entity0 midfielder			1
" i 'm going to carry on playing and although i ca n't confirm at this stage where that will be , i can say it will be somewhere that means i wo n't be playing for a competing club and will not therefore be lining up against @entity0 -- that is something i could never contemplate			1
" tributes from fellow professionals have poured in			0
@entity0 teammate @entity38 told @entity1 : " it has been an honor and it is still an honor for me to play with this amazing man			2
he is a top professional and a true legend			0
" former teammates for both club and country also took to @entity46 to praise the midfielder			0
@entity48 said : " hard for the @entity4 news to sink in			2
amazing servant to @entity0 , arguably the best of all time , " while @entity51 tweeted : " sad day for @entity56 & @entity57 football with the @entity4 news			1
i think its the right decision all things considered			0
" the 34 - year - old made his first - team debut for the @entity64 in november 1998 and has scored 180 goals to date in all competitions			0
@entity4 , who also represented @entity67 114 times before retiring in july , won eight trophies with the club including two @entity71 , three @entity72 and the @entity73 in 2001			1
his greatest achievement came in 2005 when he captained @entity0 to victory in the @entity77 final against @entity78 in @entity79			2
@entity4 won the @entity81 award as @entity83 's side overturned a three - goal deficit to eventually win a dramatic match in a penalty shoot - out			1
it was @entity4 's looping headed goal early in the second half that sparked @entity0 's remarkable recovery			1
however , his long - cherished desire to win the @entity25 never materialized -- @entity0 came close in 2009 finishing second to @entity93 and last season @entity96 ' side were pipped to the post by @entity98			1
even more distressingly @entity4 's mistake in the 2 - 0 home defeat by @entity101 near the end of the season gifted the visitors their first goal -- an error opposition supporters continue to remind the @entity0 captain about in a song during games			1
a 19th @entity110 in his final season , and a first for the club in a quarter of century , looks improbable -- the @entity113 are currently in eighth place in the table , 17 points off top spot			0
@entity4 reasserted his commitment to the team for the rest of the season and has n't ruled out a return to @entity123 in the future			2
" it is a very special place to be part of			0
it is my sincere hope and wish that one day i can return to serve @entity0 again , in whatever capacity best helps the club , " he said			0
@entity4 also paid tribute to @entity96 , the owners , his teammates and backroom staff , but reserved his most heartfelt thanks to the club 's loyal supporters			0
" my final message is for the people who make @entity0 the greatest in the world -- the supporters			2
" it has been a privilege to represent you , as a player and as captain			0
i have cherished every second of it and it is my sincere wish to finish this season and my @entity0 career on a high			2
