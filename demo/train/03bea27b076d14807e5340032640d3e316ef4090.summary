-- a @entity2 judge revoked bond friday for @entity4 , who is charged with second - degree murder in the death of @entity7			1
@entity9 circuit judge @entity8 ordered @entity4 to surrender to the county sheriff no later than sunday afternoon			1
@entity8 accused @entity4 of having misrepresented how much money he had when his bond was originally set in april			1
prosecutors say he had $ 135,000 at the time @entity4 's wife , @entity14 , told the court , under oath , that they were indigent			1
the prosecution cited as evidence recorded telephone conversations that @entity4 had with his wife prior to the hearing			1
the conversations were recorded while @entity4 was being held in the @entity23 after being charged with second - degree murder on april 11			1
he has pleaded not guilty and has been free on bail			0
@entity7 , 17 , was fatally shot february 26 while walking in a @entity27 , @entity2 , neighborhood where he was staying during a visit with his father			1
@entity4 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , told police he shot the teenager in self - defense			1
" the defense , through mrs. @entity4 , lied to this court about the amount of money that they had , " said trial prosecutor @entity33			1
" i do n't know what words to use other than it was a blatant lie			0
" outside the courthouse , a lawyer for the family of @entity7 said friday 's decision is significant			1
" judge @entity8 's finding that @entity4 was dishonest is very important because his credibility is the most important thing in this entire case , " @entity46 told reporters			1
the killing spurred protests among people who criticized police handling of the investigation and said @entity7 , who was unarmed and carrying a bag of @entity58 and an @entity59 at the time he was killed , was racially profiled			1
the teen was @entity61 ; @entity4 is @entity62			1
in court documents , state attorney @entity63 also said that @entity4 had two passports , and the passport that he surrendered to the court at the april hearing was one that @entity4 had reported stolen on march 8 , 2004			1
that passport was valid until may 2012 , @entity69 said			0
@entity4 was issued a second passport on march 26 , 2004 , and that one is valid until 2014 , she said			1
the prosecutor asked the court that @entity4 be ordered to surrender the second passport to authorities			1
but @entity8 appeared to accept the explanation from @entity4 's lawyer that his client had given him the second passport , and the lawyer simply forgot to hand it over to authorities until friday			1
regarding @entity4 's finances , @entity69 alleged that in the recorded phone calls in april the couple " spoke in code to hide what they were doing " regarding the money in a credit union account belonging to the couple			1
the money was apparently donated by members of the public to @entity4 's website			1
@entity4 " fully controlled and participated in the transfer of money from the @entity99 account to defendant and his wife 's credit union accounts , " @entity69 said in court records			1
" this occurred prior to the time defendant was arguing to the court that he was indigent and his wife had no money			0
" in late april , @entity4 's attorney , @entity108 , said that the money raised by the website was put into a trust account that the attorney controls			2
but @entity69 stated friday in the court documents : " the money still belongs to defendant and he can demand it at any time			0
" court papers provided a partial transcript of a phone call allegedly showing the code used by @entity4 and his wife on april 16 : @entity4 : " in my account do i have at least $ 100 ? " his wife : " no. " @entity4 : " how close am i ? " his wife : " $ 8			2
" @entity4 : " really			2
so total everything how much are we looking at ? " his wife : " like $ 155			0
" the prosecutor said the judge " relied on false representations and statements " by @entity4 and his wife when the court set his bond at $ 150,000			2
he was required to post only 10 % of that			0
@entity69 argued that the court should revoke the bond or increase it " substantially			0
" @entity8 appeared angry that the court had not been told about the money			0
" does your client get to sit there like a potted palm and let you lead me down the primrose path ? " he asked @entity4 's lawyer			2
" that 's the issue			0
" @entity108 told @entity0 on friday night that he had discussed the judge 's decision with @entity4 , who was not in court on friday			2
" he 's frustrated because he now has to come out of hiding , " @entity108 told @entity0 's @entity149			0
" you need to realize we 're still talking about a 28 - year - old who 's being charged with a crime he does not believe he committed , and his whole life has been turned upside down , so i think that it all needs to be kept in context			2
" @entity108 added that he hoped the judge 's revocation of bond would be temporary			0
" we 're going to have a conversation with the judge to try to explain it away			0
hopefully , that will be worthwhile and we 're going to get back out on bond			0
" meanwhile , @entity4 's defense team and prosecutors were both on the same side in court friday afternoon fighting media companies ' request to release more information in the case			1
prosecution and defense lawyers argued that a host of material should remain sealed			1
opinion : shooting was n't a case of racial profiling the intense public attention on the case is a chief reason certain information should remain out of the public eye , @entity33 said in a motion filed earlier this month			2
he argued that releasing too much " will result in this matter being tried in the press rather than in court , and an inability to seat a fair and impartial jury in @entity9			0
" @entity192 also voiced worries about witnesses being " reluctant to testify " for fear that their privacy would be violated and other witnesses being " harassed by media representatives			0
" specifically , the state wants the names and addresses of witnesses kept out of the public record			0
it asks for the same for crime scene and autopsy photos , a 911 recording of the incident , and cell phone records of @entity7 , @entity4 and one witness			1
@entity192 is also requesting a judge seal statements @entity4 made to law enforcement officers , some of which may be used against him at trial because they were " inconsistent with the physical evidence and statements of witnesses			2
" new documents shed light on @entity7 killing @entity108 filed his own motion agreeing with the prosecution 's desire not to release material			1
he said the defense wants 1,000 e-mails received by @entity27 police to be sealed , plus statements by @entity4			1
he asked that text messages , e-mail messages or journals made by the defendant be kept private , at least until they can be reviewed			0
@entity232 of the @entity234 - based law firm @entity233 argued for more disclosure on behalf of various newspapers , tv stations and their parent companies			0
the opposing arguments were laid out in motions filed in advance of friday 's hearing			0
this week , @entity232 filed responses to the prosecution and defense positions , addressing them point by point			2
" the broad secrecy the state seeks ... is not supported by statute , constitution or case law , and it certainly can not be justified in this prosecution , " he said			2
@entity232 argued that civilian witnesses ' names and addresses can not be sealed under @entity2 's public records law , because they would not be " defamatory " or " jeopardize the safety " of a witness			0
he said the state has n't proven anyone is in jeopardy			0
the contested cell phone records may be reviewed and , if need be , have parts redacted , but they should n't be withheld entirely , he said			0
@entity232 said @entity4 's statements to police should not be treated as " confessions , " which would not be made public before trial			2
the judge expressed sympathy for the prosecution and defense attorneys but said , " the law is against us			2
" he noted that the law in @entity2 " favors full , complete , open disclosure			0
" @entity8 said he would review the discovery request and release material " in a redacted fashion			0
" @entity283 's @entity282 , @entity0 's @entity284 and @entity286 's @entity285 contributed to this report .			0
