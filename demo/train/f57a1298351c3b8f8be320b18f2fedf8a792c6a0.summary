@entity0 has all the trappings of a @entity4 footballer			1
there is the reported $ 334,000 - a - week salary , the luxury homes and cars , not to mention the silverware from last season when @entity11 won the @entity4 and the @entity12			1
yet despite that success , including a fourth straight @entity17 title , the @entity11 and @entity14 talisman describes 2014 as " a horrible year			1
" no wonder -- it 's barely six months since his younger brother @entity20 died while @entity0 and his brother @entity21 were on @entity23 duty in @entity24			1
as for what lies in store during 2015 , he 's no idea			2
asked if he wants to stay put at @entity28 , @entity0 says , in a wide - ranging interview with @entity1 's @entity30 : " that 's a big question and that 's an easy question as well , and you have an easy answer ... we 'll see			1
" pressed on whether he plans to still be at the @entity36 for the 2015 - 16 @entity4 season , he says : " i do n't know			0
@entity11 is a great club where i 've achieved lots of things			1
" those less than equivocal answers bring us to @entity0 's @entity45 " @entity41 " moment			1
after @entity11 's title triumph last season , his agent @entity46 said @entity0 was upset that the @entity14 's birthday had n't been properly " acknowledged " by the club			1
" he got a cake but when it was @entity54 's birthday , the president of ( @entity57 side ) @entity56 ( @entity58 ) gave him a @entity59 , " @entity46 reportedly said			0
" sometimes it makes you disappointed when the story is going wrong , " says @entity0 looking back on the episode			1
" i do n't want to open my heart up again and open my mind to the newspaper [ reports ] again because there have been such disappointing things running in the newspaper that have hurt me a lot			0
but i 'm a guy who is very strong mentally			0
" @entity0 says he felt let down by certain individuals over how the story unfolded , though he 's not divulging any names			1
however , he is quick to credit the @entity11 supporters as well as chairman @entity77 and manager @entity78 for ensuring he felt loved again			1
though it 's playing that provides the greatest solace			0
" it 's only football that keeps me peaceful , " adds @entity0			1
" it 's only the feeling of going after the ball that makes me happy			0
it 's only once i see the @entity28 fans singing my name and the manager told me i want to cover , to take more space , it makes me feel happy and it 's all i want			0
" @entity0 is very much a player who wears his heart on his sleeve , and that becomes very apparent as he reflects on the highs and lows of 2014			1
the biggest low came while in @entity24 when news of @entity20 's death was broken to him over the phone by another of his brothers			1
for @entity0 , the tragedy still remains raw : " 2014 was , i think i can say , a horrible year for me			2
" it was disappointing in the @entity23			2
of course , we won the @entity4 and the cup this year but i think with the death of my brother it was a hard one , the hardest one because i was not preparing to support such a situation			2
" in the family you have one who you love , one who you care about above all the rest and i think @entity20 was this guy			2
when he passed away ... that time was quite difficult because we have the beginning of this season in the @entity4 and to manage that was difficult			0
" amid the tragedy , @entity0 and sibling @entity21 , who plays for @entity118 , opted to stay in @entity24 and represent their country			2
it 's a decision that he still regrets to this day			0
playing the ensuing game against @entity124 , he admits , " in my mind , i was thinking that after the game i was calling him [ @entity20 ]			2
i was still asking ' how do you feel about the game i played against @entity124 ? ' but he passed away before the game			0
" perhaps the memory is in some ways just as raw now , with the brothers back in international action for their country for the upcoming @entity134 ( @entity134 ) in @entity135			2
at this time the loyalties of all @entity138 players are tested , given so many play for top @entity141 club , which are often fighting for titles and cups			0
" it 's difficult because your country and club is always our hardest divide especially the @entity11 fans , the chairman , the boss as well , they 're good with me and i want to give 100 % when i 'm there , " said the 31 - year - old			1
the elephants are undeniably one of the strongest teams in the continent of @entity158 given they can call on the likes of the @entity160 , recent @entity11 signing @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			2
but the nation have not always shone at international level -- especially at @entity158 's most prestigious tournament -- winning just one @entity134 title back in 1992 , and finishing runners - up in 2006 and again two years ago			1
" i think it 's the lack of concentration or maybe it 's because we fear our own team			0
we think we are the best but ... you have to have desire , you have to have determination , " says @entity0 , reflecting on his country 's relative under - performance at the tournament			1
" we have to be mentally ready for the hard battle because in @entity158 it 's not only the opponent we have to fight			0
we have to fight the temperature as well , we have to fight the field			0
" the tournament had been due to take place in @entity189 but , amid fears of the @entity192 crisis , the @entity138 nation withdrew as hosts and @entity135 stepped in as hosts			0
@entity192 remains a talking point among players and @entity0 has no qualms that it 's something that concerns him ahead of an opening game against @entity135 , where the disease has taken hold			1
" it 's difficult when you feel like your family can maybe contract this infection , you 're a little bit afraid , " he says			0
" yes , we fear but we ca n't say we do n't want to go because it 's a situation we need to educate people because people do n't understand how to protect themselves against this infection			0
" there was talk of perhaps scrapping the tournament for a year due to the threat posed by @entity192 , but @entity0 believes organizers are right to go ahead			2
" january is the time when the @entity138 people can enjoy , " he says			0
" the @entity138 player coming from @entity141 is like a moment in a dream for the @entity138 because , when they see us coming , they are always happy			0
" it 's going to be like a big fiesta where people can enjoy , they can dance , they can love and they can do what they want			0
" after @entity0 's tumultuous 2014 , he 's hopeful it will prove the perfect start to 2015 .			1

@entity0 says ' we 'll see ' when asked if he expects to still be at @entity11 next season
