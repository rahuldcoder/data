@entity0 -- if new is a necessity , tech is your god and money no object then a $ 10,000 @entity9 smartphone will probably catch your eye			1
the @entity12 - based luxury mobile phone maker unveiled the @entity13 this week			2
its sapphire - crystal screen is virtually scratchproof , says the company , while a titanium casing helps keep data safe and sound			1
but in this 21st century mobile phone paradigm in which consumers buy a new phone every few years -- and where new products roll out every year ( or even less ) -- does it make sense to splurge on a swank smartphone with a price tag closer to that of a small car or several months ' apartment rent ? " if you are interested in something which is different , unique " then this device might be for you , said @entity9 ceo @entity34 to @entity1 's @entity35			1
the @entity13 ( pronounced " tee - eye " ) emphasizes the value of " durable " over " disposable " materials that a consumer might expect from the luxury category , added @entity34			1
" more the touch and the feel and the sensory experience			0
" and with the sensory experience comes luxury services that go beyond that of a mainstream smartphone including a concierge service at the push of a button and encrypted voice calls to protect your company trade secrets			1
yet another selling point is the software that powers the @entity54			0
former @entity9 phones ran on the now - @entity59 © @entity58 software			2
the @entity13 , meanwhile , runs on an @entity61 operating system in a sign of its separation from former parent company @entity64			0
the flailing @entity66 mobile giant lost $ 2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2012 and announced last june that it would sell @entity9 to private equity group @entity67			2
" we live in a world where there 's open operating systems that are quite open to use , " explained @entity34 on the new angle to @entity61			2
" @entity61 is just delivering great software			0
" but while the operating system is open to all , the costly @entity9 clearly is not			0
around the world , only about 320,000 @entity9 smartphones have been sold , said @entity1 's @entity78 , a number that pales in comparison to @entity81 and @entity82 , the global smartphone market leaders			1
for all of 2012 , @entity81 sold more than 215 million smartphones for a 30.3 % global market share and top ranking , according to @entity87			1
@entity82 sold nearly 136 million smartphones in 2012 for a 19.1 % slice of global market share			1
even @entity9 's former parent company @entity64 sold more than 35 million smartphones last year			1
but @entity9 's ceo simply says he does not envisage the masses talking and texting on a @entity13			1
that 's never our drive			0
we 're not after market share			2
we 're not after high quantities , " said @entity34			0
" we want to deliver an authentic , made in @entity100 , made by one person , a unique proposition that is a true sensory experience in terms of the experience of the device			0
" and consumers who buy the @entity13 will surely want to avoid losing their pricy purchase			0
then again , if they can afford one , they might be well - positioned to afford a replacement .			0
