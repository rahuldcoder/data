@entity0 -- the massacre in @entity3 brought back an old memory -- a day in the 1970s when as a 12 - year - old @entity7 school boy i had held my first gun			1
on a wednesday , a short school day in @entity7 , one of my classmates had brought a whole group of kids to his house			1
the parents were away at the office so we tasted a few drops of his dad 's @entity20 , checked out his older brother 's collection of @entity24 , then , as if we needed to complete our transgressions , our young host led us upstairs , opened a drawer in the master bedroom , and pulled out this mass of black metal			0
many of us had seen our grandfathers ' hunting rifles , but this was the real thing -- designed to pierce big holes in human bodies			0
and as we passed the gun along , some of us refused to touch it			2
the weapon conveyed less the glamorous image of @entity42 thrillers than the ghastly and realistic press account of the end of a gangster , riddled with bullets by the police in the middle of @entity49 a few weeks before			0
will @entity3 change @entity51 's attitude toward guns ? it also brought back the story a teacher had told us about the sound he had heard as a child in @entity58 , of @entity60 soldiers finishing off hostages one by one in a courtyard of his village			1
as we left the house that day , we all had the strange feeling we had just met the ultimate taboo , an instrument of ugly death belonging either to a dark underworld , or to a higher and overpowering authority			1
as a reporter in the @entity51 , i sometimes had to smile at my prudish @entity75 state of mind , when i saw , for example , members of the @entity77 in @entity78 casually eating their pizza , their guns visible in their belts , or every time i pass by the weapons counter at @entity85 where families buy guns as if they were shopping for the nearby kitchen appliances			1
to a foreigner , the horror of @entity91 , the abyss of @entity3 may bring another surprise -- the unbelievable ease with which the perpetrators have gathered their arsenal , their casual expertise in using it as an extension of their mundane anxieties , the bloody resolution of trivial problems at home with mom and dad			0
the @entity75 press as a whole may have once again stigmatized " @entity51 's love story with its guns " but the story seems to be less about love or passion than about the amazing familiarity and trivialization of instruments of death displayed by @entity51			1
on friday , a relative called me from @entity7			1
a retired kindergarten teacher , she told me about the " gut wrenching pain " she had felt following the news of faraway @entity124			0
as we ended our conversation , she wondered : " are we that far behind them ? " sure , a few months ago , a young @entity7 jihadist named @entity129 massacred children in a @entity132 school in @entity133			1
in peaceful @entity135 , a neo-nazi went on a nightmarish rampage			0
but both plans stemmed from another world , that of terrorism -- a warrior 's logic so determined and deeply rooted in ideology it defied any norm of the society it targeted			0
in @entity7 , the last mass shooting comparable to the recent @entity51 random murders dates back to 2002 , when a @entity149 gunned down eight members of the city council of his home town of @entity154 , a suburb of @entity49			1
and the only known equivalent of @entity91 , @entity156 or @entity3 took place in @entity158 , @entity159 , in march 1996 when a former scout leader killed 16 children and one adult in a school			0
yet , why does n't it happen more often ? one explanation comes to mind			2
it is way more difficult to find an efficient weapon in @entity75 , and this challenge may deter all but the most determined potential murderers			1
i concur with the @entity51 gun lobby that gun control amounts to an obvious restriction of individual liberties			1
like most @entity7 or @entity75 citizens , i would add a point : so what ? who even cares that , barring some ( even more restrictive ) amendments added since the 1980s , most of our gun laws date back to the decrees of april 18 , 1939			1
it was a time of official mobilization against @entity188 's imminent offensive , a time when a derelict @entity7 government cared less about its citizens killing each other than about the populace , or political factions , turning their weapons against the state for an insurrection			1
for the next four years , the occupants , and the collaborationist regime of @entity200 , simplified the system by executing anybody found in possession of a mere hunting rifle			0
and after the war , the legitimate government made an absolute priority of collecting the assault weapons hidden in private attics all around the country and reaffirming the 1939 law			2
it is still in place			0
there are eight categories of weapon , ranging from automatic hardware and machine guns which are prohibited , to hunting equipment allowed with a hunting permit			2
to get any category one or four weapons , like the @entity224 or the @entity225 used in @entity3 , you need to be 21 , to have joined a shooting range for the last six months , provided a blank criminal record and a certificate of physical and mental health not older than two weeks			0
then , the local police precinct starts a " morality investigation " in your neighborhood that rivals the clearance work done by the @entity234 for anybody employed at the @entity236			0
once you buy a gun , you still do n't own it			1
property rights do n't apply to weapons			1
even the @entity75 community , in spite of its principles of free enterprise and individual liberties , confirmed that there is no such thing as a right to own a weapon			2
a license is a temporary exception to the rule of prohibition			0
it is a privilege revoked after three years , before a new application			0
world reaction : ' my heart is in @entity3 ' these are the rules , but they are just rules			0
but our fear and taboos about firearms are a much more efficient gun control in our society			1
the laws are so strict they can not be efficiently implemented			0
that is why , mostly for bureaucratic reasons , more than 16 million weapons are unaccounted for and kept illegally , according to @entity272 , mostly by otherwise law - abiding @entity7 citizens			1
still , per capita , our murder rate is a fraction of the @entity51 one			2
this does n't mean @entity7 is not growing more violent			1
its underworld is changing and expanding fast			0
gangsters now use @entity281 [ rocket - propelled grenades ] and bazookas to attack bank trucks , and military grade fully automatic weapons to kill their guards			2
drug dealers execute their competitors in @entity290 with dreadful impunity			0
the @entity293 mob , or its independent networks have killed 20 people in the island in a year			0
thousands of military grade weapons are flowing now in western @entity75 , the remnants of the recent @entity301 wars , exported by corrupt officials all around the former eastern block			1
a few blocks from the house where i first saw my first gun , teenage dealers stash kalashnikovs in the basements of project buildings			0
they are still rarely used , and to most @entity7 people , they belong in a parallel world			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity316 .			2

@entity316 says @entity51 display amazing familiarity with instruments of death
way harder to find efficient weapons in @entity75 , he says : this may deter potential killers
@entity7 hunters do n't own guns , he points out . they only get three - year license to use guns
@entity316 : there are many illegal guns , but fear and taboo are more efficient gun control
