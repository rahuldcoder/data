@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 regrets the day she heard a radio advertisement for dr. @entity5			2
@entity6 plastic surgeon @entity5 operated on the mother of rapper @entity8 the day before she died			2
eager to fix breasts that were n't the same size and a rash that occurred where her breasts rubbed against her stomach , @entity3 , then 28 , went to see @entity15 in his office in @entity17 , @entity18			2
she says she trusted him right away			2
" i fell for his charm			2
i fell for his confidence , " she says			2
but her surgery turned out to be a " nightmare , " she says			2
@entity3 says that in march 2006 , @entity15 gave her a breast augmentation , tummy tuck and liposuction -- all at one time			2
" the next day i woke up fighting for every breath			0
it was like an elephant was sitting on my chest , " she says			0
" and when i got up to go the restroom i noticed the girdle i was wearing was soaked with fluid and blood			0
for days i was soaking through blankets and towels			0
" @entity3 says she had three infections			0
she had a second surgery a few weeks later to remove fluid from her hips			0
questions surrounding the death of another of @entity15 ' patients , @entity43 , mother of rapper @entity8 , have reignited @entity3 's pain , she says			1
she has not sued @entity15 but says she may in the future			0
asked to respond to @entity3 's comments , @entity15 issued a statement through his publicist , @entity52			1
" i believe very strongly in the fundamental @entity55 principle of the right of the individual to defend himself , " the statement said			0
" recently inaccurate and , frankly , false statements have ciruculated that require clarification			0
unfortunately , it has become impossible to separate thsese statements from other professional issues			0
i will await my turn			0
" today , @entity3 has advice on how others can avoid becoming plastic surgery victims , and so do board - certified plastic surgeons			1
make sure the surgeon is board - certified this one , say experts , is a no - brainer			1
for plastic surgery , you want a doctor who 's certified by the @entity76			1
it 's simple : the @entity79 ' web site will tell you if a doctor is board - certified in plastic surgery			1
why is it so important to have a board - certified surgeon ? because legally any doctor is permitted to do any procedure -- a psychiatrist could do a breast augmentation			1
if you use a board - certified plastic surgeon , you know he or she has completed three to five years of training in general surgery and a minimum of two to three years of training in plastic surgery , plus they have to take written and oral tests , according to dr. @entity98 , chairman - elect of the @entity76 and assistant clinical professor at the @entity100			1
board - certified plastic surgeons also have to do continuing medical education and take a written test every 10 years			1
check the surgeon 's record @entity3 says she never would have gone to @entity15 if she 'd known he had two malpractice judgments against him			1
she could have found that out easily by going to the @entity109 's web site			1
links to the web sites of every state 's medical board can be found here			1
many state licensing boards , like @entity18 's , list malpractice judgments , plus any disciplinary actions by the board			1
( since @entity3 's surgery , @entity15 has had a third malpractice judgment against him , plus an accusation filed with the board )			1
ask if the surgeon has hospital privileges even if you 're having a plastic surgery procedure at an outpatient clinic , it 's worth asking where the doctor has hospital privileges , because hospitals do background checks , says dr. @entity133 , past president of the @entity134			1
" if they do n't have hospital privileges , that 's a huge red flag , " he says			1
come armed with questions for the doctor one crucial question for your potential surgeon is how often he or she does the procedure you 're interested in			1
" if i 'm coming to you for a facelift , you 'd better do it almost weekly , " says @entity133 , who 's also chairman of the department of plastic surgery at the @entity147			1
the @entity151 's web site has a list of questions you can print out and bring with you to the doctor 's office			1
for example , the medical board suggests asking whether the physician will be performing the procedure in its entirety			1
be wary of multiple procedures @entity3 says when she went to @entity15 , he suggested three procedures			1
" when you bundle procedures , the risk goes up , " says @entity98 , the plastic surgeon in @entity163			2
the more procedures you have , the more money the doctor makes			1
dr. @entity170 , a plastic surgeon at @entity171 , says an unethical surgeon might suggest a neck lift when someone has come in looking for just for a nose job			0
" unfortunately , money is a motivation in some people			0
" perhaps the most valuable advice , @entity3 says , is to be swayed only by objective information about the surgeon , and not by how the doctor makes you feel			2
" [ @entity15 ] truly sounded like he was going to help me			0
he seemed like he would be truly concerned about me , " she says			0
but @entity3 says that when things did n't go well after her surgery , she was taken aback by @entity15 ' response			0
" i told him , ' i ca n't put my right arm down -- there 's a huge lump under my arm			2
' i was crying , " she says			0
she says he told her to take her medicine and rest and give herself time to heal			0
more than a year and a half after her surgery , @entity3 says her stomach is " concave , " she has shooting pains in her breasts , and her " nipples are uneven and in the wrong place			0
" @entity3 says she wishes she had taken a friend or relative with her to her pre-surgical appointments with @entity15			0
" an aunt or my mother or some other strong female in my life might have picked up on things i did n't pick up on , or thought of questions i did n't think of , " she says			0
" and there are no stupid questions when you 're about to alter yourself in some major way			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity214 is a correspondent with @entity215			0
@entity2 's @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .			2
