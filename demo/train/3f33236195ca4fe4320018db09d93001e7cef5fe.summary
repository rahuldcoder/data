-- eight - year - old @entity1 takes my hand and leads me into her mud - thatched hut in my home village of @entity6 in rural @entity7			1
there , in a dark corner of the room , is a wooden bookshelf			2
carefully crafted by her father , it protects her word - filled treasures from the smoky fire inside the small hut where her mother cooks			0
i smile , knowing that her father has recognized the value these books will bring to his little bookworm -- a life ahead of her with limitless opportunities			1
it was not a life intended for many girls in @entity28			0
as a cattle - herding tomboy , i was bound to follow in the footsteps of generations of women before me : early marriage , illiteracy and poverty			1
back then , most kids in my village never had a chance to attend pre-school because it did n't exist			1
instead , we would spend hours chasing birds and monkeys from our parents ' fields			0
@entity46 mines and urban factories employed men , while women remained at home to look after their children			0
the more men could read and write , the better their chances of being employed and able to provide for their family			0
as a result , families wanted to educate their sons , who became village role models			1
without an education , how could girls compete ? how could they become role models , too ? that was more than 40 years ago			1
today , change is happening in my beloved @entity6 , and all across the long red dirt roads , verdant mountains and open blue skies of @entity28			0
the leaders of @entity28 countries have made education more of a priority , even for girls			1
now , girls can be role models			0
girls like me , a cattle herder who married young , and by age 18 had three children and no high school diploma			1
but i defied the odds , got an education and came back to build a school			1
read this : @entity7 's whizz - kid starts university at 14 @entity6 parents and villagers are seeing the value of educating girls			1
girls can become leaders of our communities and our @entity28 nations			0
many parents bring their daughters to me and ask : " can she be just like you ? " @entity6 parents are sending their daughters to school like never before			1
education is the pathway out of poverty and the road to change for boys and girls alike			1
mothers , fathers , teachers , brothers and sisters have come together to feed the minds and cultivate growth in learning among children			0
@entity117 things can happen when you put the right tools in the hands of communities			0
it is a road to change that leads to @entity6 and surrounding communities			0
here , through a partnership with the @entity130 and @entity131 , @entity6 children are getting a safer school and a better quality education			1
the community is partnering with @entity131 , the @entity135 and the @entity136 , @entity137 , to prepare young boys and girls for school and help older children improve their reading skills , with promising early results			1
it is an amazing transformation			0
our teachers have been trained to keep up with this growth			0
@entity148 : ' @entity149 ' as school girls graduate @entity151 has become the ripple effect of change			1
you can see it in change makers like the grandmothers here who volunteered and molded nearly 400,000 bricks for the newly constructed school			2
molding and curing bricks is exhausting , back - breaking work but when a community owns the process , nothing can stop it			2
the community realizes something important is at stake : education for all children			2
change makers like @entity172 , who built the preschool center in his village , and the 346 volunteers who built preschool playgrounds made of locally available materials , and participated in parenting skills training			2
change makers like @entity180 and 72 other trained volunteers who are promoting and leading after - school reading camps and creating handmade books			2
change makers like gogo ( grandmother ) @entity188 , who never learned to read or write but now encourages her own grandchildren to read at home			0
she told me in a text message sent by a village boy , " @entity196 , my daughter could not read and write and died leaving orphans under my care			2
now they can read at home and i get to participate in their reading , it has never been heard of until the @entity205			0
" it warms my heart when i picture gogo @entity209 taking part in her grandchildren 's education			1
read this : millionaire educating future leaders but there are many more gogo @entity209 's in @entity28 who do not even know they can be part of the solution			2
how can we involve them , and how can we improve our children 's education ? what more can we do to encourage children to read at home ? what more can we do to promote sending all children to school instead of out into the field to work ? what more can we do to keep girls in school and out of early marriage ? what more can we do to nurture girls as role models ? from my tiny village of @entity6 and all across this mother continent , we -- our communities -- have the power to bring our @entity28 children out of the darkness of illiteracy and into the light of learning			1
it is a light that beams brightly on progress			0
it is a light that lets @entity28 girls like me and @entity1 dream big			0
@entity248 ! it is achievable			0
learn more about the @entity250 and @entity131 's @entity251			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			1

poverty and cultural *traditions* kept @entity254 out of school for most of her childhood
but that did n't stop the @entity7 from fulfilling her desire to get an education
@entity266 has defied odds to earn three *degrees* , *including* a *phd*
now , she 's ensuring kids from her village have the opportunities she *lacked* as a child
