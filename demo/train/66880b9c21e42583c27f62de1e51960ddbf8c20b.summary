-- " now stay in bed and go to sleep , " my husband , @entity0 , said as he hugged our 3 - year - old son , @entity3 , good night			2
" if you do n't , i 'm gon na talk in my troll voice all day tomorrow			1
" as dads spend more time with their kids , mothers sometimes feel they have to defend their territory			1
i smiled with pity at this poor , deluded man			2
several times a night , @entity3 had been getting up to look at books			2
i had spent fruitless hours reasoning with him			2
no way could @entity0 's threat make a difference , especially since @entity3 found his troll - under - the - bridge act more funny than scary			2
but that night , @entity3 did n't get up once			1
in the morning he ran around crowing that he 'd won and the troll could n't come			1
@entity0 , unlike me , must have known that @entity3 needed to turn staying in bed into a game			2
of course i was grateful			2
i was also just the tiniest bit jealous			2
why had n't i been the one with the great insight ? why could n't i talk like a troll ? it 's comforting to know that i 'm not the only mom who 's had such moments			1
plenty of us admit to everything from mild envy to full - blown resentment of our mates ' parenting skills			1
and that makes us feel ungrateful : after all , we finally have something that mothers have wanted for generations : an extra pair of hands			1
today 's dads spend 21.7 hours a week on child care and related duties such as shopping and housework , up nine hours from 30 years ago , according to research by the @entity49			1
which is n't to say that moms still do n't handle the vast majority of kid - linked tasks -- a whopping 39 hours weekly			1
still , our guys are doing more than their dads did			1
fathers clip tiny toenails and baby - food coupons			0
they read bedtime stories and clothing labels			0
and while some of our own dads had no clue about how to change a diaper , our kids ' dads often have fierce opinions on @entity69 versus @entity70			1
parenting : secrets to a made - to - last marriage we moms say we want our spouses to be do - it - all dads : we 're forward - thinking women of the 21st century			1
besides , if they did less , we could n't possibly juggle our busy lives without going nuts			1
" but we do n't want them to take over , " says @entity80 , a mother of two in @entity82 " we do n't ever want to be pushed off that throne of being @entity85			1
" jealousy and envy and ego , oh my ! one reason we 're possessive of the parental crown may be that , although society 's changed , we still get traditional messages about women 's roles			0
" a lot of our mothers , our workplaces , our tv shows still tell us that moms should do most of the childcare , " says @entity94 , @entity95 , a marriage and family therapist with three kids in @entity98 , @entity99			1
we moms can be good at taking such messages to heart			1
parenting : keeping score in the chore wars " for women , no matter how far along you are in your career or no matter how much of a feminist you consider yourself to be , at some level you 're coming from an assumption that women are caretakers , " says @entity111 of @entity112 , @entity113 , a law professor and the mother of @entity116 , 6 , and @entity117 , 2			1
" when @entity116 was a baby , i would feel guilty about the time away from her , " she says			1
and at home , sharing child care with her husband , she felt a little jealous that he was as central to @entity116 's life as she was			1
" now that i 've gone through this twice , all i 'd add is that the twinges of regret are overwhelmed by the joy of raising kids together			0
there 's no other reason i can think of for that jealousy , except for the guilty , nagging feeling that you ought to be spending more time with your child			1
" well , there are at least a few other reasons			0
the briefness of those precious early years , for one			0
" when our son was a baby , @entity148 gave him more of his baths , " says @entity146 of @entity147			0
( both names were changed			0
) she believed it was important for them to have such one - on - one moments , but " i remember thinking a few times , ' i should take the bath with him ! ' especially when they 're babies , you 're likely to think , ' i want this piece or that piece ' because babies sleep so much and quality time with them is much more limited than with an older child			1
" parenting 's guide to kid sleep then there 's the matter of love			1
naturally , when our spouses spend extra time nurturing our children , the kids become extra attached			0
" @entity180 * just adores his dad			0
he 's his little shadow , " @entity182 * of @entity183 , @entity184 , says of her 3 - year - old son			0
she understands the daddy worship ; she thinks her husband , is " more playful " with @entity180 than she is			0
" but at first it just hurt because i did n't feel that he loved me as much as [ him ] , " she admits			1
for some moms , like me , what hurts is a deep - seated notion that we should be better parents than our spouses -- more instinctive , more inventive , more in tune with our kids ' needs			1
@entity201 of @entity202 , @entity203 , finds herself battling this idea when her daughter is sick			0
because she ca n't get paid time off from her job as an attorney , her husband is usually the one to stay home with @entity209 , 8			1
" i know he 's very capable of caring for her , but i want to believe i 'm better at it than he is -- even though i 'm not			0
i think it 's the whole ' i 'm the mommy and i can fix anything			0
' it 's almost like a savior thing			0
" working mothers are n't the only ones who long to be saviors			1
@entity221 of @entity222 , @entity223 , quit working as a high school teacher when her second daughter was born			0
" when you 've made this decision to stay home , you 've given up this side of you where you can shine as your own person			0
instead , you feel pressure to shine as a parent , " she explains			1
which can make it frustrating when your husband is as much fun with the kids as you are			0
" recently @entity239 helped them make their own version of @entity242			0
i thought , ' why ca n't i think of things that are more creative ? ' " she says			1
" it seems he 's doing very well at work and then when he comes home he 's doing very well with the kids , so it 's like he 's doing great everywhere and i 'm running to keep up			0
" who 's the boss ? if we 're not careful , jealousy and insecurity can turn moms into control freaks			1
so says @entity259 , a recovering control freak herself			0
" with our first child , i was constantly asking my husband , ' are you making sure he 's getting his vegetables ? ' it feels good to make the decisions			2
" trouble is , " the more we control how dads do things , the less involved they want to be , " @entity259 says			2
a recent @entity272 study of almost 100 couples with newborns backs her up : researchers found that even dads who believed they should be highly involved in childcare shied away from doing things for their infant if @entity85 was very judgmental			2
parenting : the truth about bonding so @entity259 recommends trying what she did with her husband and her son , @entity286 , now 11			2
" i had to let go and let them have their own relationship -- he 's a competent man ! if @entity286 does n't have a vegetable , who cares ? " when you find yourself hovering , @entity259 suggests , leave the room			2
and if you feel compelled to share some crucial knowledge -- the latest food pyramid for toddlers , say -- try offering him some childcare lit. " that way it 's neutral			2
it 's not like you 're dictating to him how to do it , " she says			0
rethinking the rivalry as for curbing the green - eyed monster , it comes down to discovering things you do well with your kids			0
when they 're babies , simply breastfeeding them is something @entity315 ca n't do , and may be enough			1
later on , try sharing your passions , from gardening to karate			0
it 's also smart to take turns doing the fun stuff , like playing with the kids , as well as the non-fun stuff ( say , disciplining them )			0
@entity315 's giving the baths ? great			1
make storytime yours , instead of moping			0
parenting : play list most important , moms say , remember how lucky your kids are to have two hands - on parents			1
@entity201 hopes that having a caring , involved father will one day spur her daughter to choose a guy with those qualities			0
" she wo n't end up with somebody she does n't respect , " she says			2
speaking of respect , adds @entity111 , it 's the best cure she 's found yet for parental jealousy			0
" just to glory in your husband 's abilities as a dad , i think , is key , " she says			0
next time @entity0 pulls off a child - care coup , i plan to be a model of admiration			2
i 'll watch and learn			0
and i wo n't begrudge him his troll voice one bit -- as long as talking like @entity355 can be mine , all mine			2

there is still a *perception* that moms should be better parents than dads
a mom does n't like to feel that a child loves @entity315 more
*advice* : appreciate having another pair of hands to help with parenting
