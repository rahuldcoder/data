@entity0 is an educator , adviser and advocate on transgender issues , and the author of " becoming a @entity5 " ( @entity6 , 2004 )			1
@entity0 transitioned from female to male just before his 40th birthday			1
welcome , @entity10 ! before the word " transsexual " had been coined in @entity12 , an intrepid young person whose family belonged to the @entity16 nobility set out to transform herself from female to male			1
he received a medical school education , obtained hormones -- relatively new substances that were poorly understood at the time , and independently began living as a man in the early 1940s			1
eventually , he found a plastic surgeon to help him , and his physical changes were complete by 1949 , but his family rejected him			2
the @entity16 tabloids hounded him			2
to escape publicity , he was forced to carve out a life for himself virtually alone			2
he became a @entity34 monk , and died in @entity35 in 1962 at the age of 47			2
his name was @entity38 , and he one of the @entity41 's first transsexual people , that is , someone who changes sex and / or gender by medical means			1
his extensive writings were suppressed and destroyed by his family -- only fragments survive			2
by 1988 , when i began my transition ( just before my 40th birthday ) , there was scarcely more information about female - to - male transsexualism available than there was in 1949			1
even in the early 1990s , doctors told transsexual people that we should not socialize together , because people might notice there were things about us that were different from " normal " people			2
many transsexual women were tall and some had broad shoulders , large hands and feet			0
most transsexual men were on the short side , and had small hands and feet			0
it 's one thing if you mix in with other people where there is a lot of physical diversity , but if you congregate with others like you , you may risk discovery			1
to be discovered as a transsexual person was a horrible fate			0
and fitting in , being " normal , " was the goal of treatment , after all			0
i was convinced that having a " sex change " was going to be a very straightforward process			1
i would take the hormones , have some surgery , and then go home and mow my lawn			0
i expected life to just be ordinary , just the way it was supposed to be			0
there were a few surprises in store for me , though , not the least of which was that i learned that the fear and shame of being known or discovered to be a transsexual person was probably responsible for a tremendous amount of suffering			0
i learned that people like me hid themselves from the world , often were under - employed or unemployed , avoided seeing physicians when they were ill , and often expected that they would never have intimate partners			0
after i began transition , i met more and more transsexual men like myself , and i saw firsthand the fear and shame that limited their lives			1
these were kind , gentle , thoughtful , serious men , and they did not deserve to live in a state of fear and shame			0
i knew then that education about who we were , and what our lives were like , would be absolutely necessary to do two things : first to let people like me know we were not alone and we did n't have to be afraid ; and second to let other people know we existed , to make the world safe for us , for our difference and our uniqueness			1
like a handful of other trans men in @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity12 , and @entity123 , i began to do public education , to write about our experience , and to educate legislators and policy makers , helping them change the laws , hoping to ease the suffering of others like ourselves who would follow in our footsteps			1
and now @entity10 announces his transition through his publicist			1
@entity135 , brave new world ! the words are here , some protective laws have been passed , @entity121 has learned that it can no longer simply destroy what it does n't understand			0
not that some people wo n't try , though			0
@entity10 , here 's hoping your transition from female to male will be effortless , but experience tells me you 're liable to have ( at least ) a few surprises and inconveniences along the way			1
here 's hoping you can maintain the privacy you want , and that you have the ability to experience your transition fully , that you are n't robbed of the experience by the demands of a public life			1
your visibility can bring new understanding			0
where others of us have run from the spotlight , and still others have been denied a voice by a disinterested public , you have the ear of the media , and you will not be ignored			0
but do n't be tempted to expose yourself when you 're not ready			0
your life must be your own			0
for me , the goal of transition was not to become " normal " -- whatever that is -- but to become balanced as myself			2
it 's a life goal that non-trans people strive for , too , and we all have different paths to get there			2
my path worked for me ; i hope yours works for you			0
good luck , brother ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			1
