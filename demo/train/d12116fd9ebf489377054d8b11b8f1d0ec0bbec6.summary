-- one was a quadriplegic who controlled the steering with his breath , the other a former wheelchair basketball paralympian who took up sailing only two years ago			1
but together they secured the first @entity10 sailing gold medal at @entity11 , and all with one race to spare			1
wednesday saw the @entity14 pair of @entity15 and @entity16 clinch victory in the two - person keelboat class , as they built an unassailable lead going into today 's final day of racing			1
the medal continued @entity14 's blistering form in sailing at the @entity25 games			1
in july they won four golds , topping the medal table			0
but this gold could be their most impressive yet , exhibiting not just great sailing prowess , but the latest in @entity10 technology -- enabling those with the most severe disabilities to compete at the highest level			1
@entity10 sailor : ' my disability is a gift ' @entity15 only has limited movement in his arms and none in his legs after breaking his back falling off a jetty when he was 21 years old			1
but technology has allowed him to compete at this year 's games , helping him to steer his specially adapted boat			1
" as part of @entity10 sailing an important aspect is the seating ... so we worked hard on that and we have some nifty systems in it , " he explained to the @entity14 press before leaving for @entity25			1
one of those " nifty systems " is the sip and puff system that allows him greater control steering his boat by blowing or sucking into a specially adapted straw that then interprets his signals			0
" ( with my hands ) all i have to do is push and pull , just like a tractor , it 's made out of light weight carbon fiber too ... my hands are strapped in so i need to find a way of controlling ( the boat ) so we came up with this sip and puff system			0
" technological breakthrough yet sailing at the @entity10 is still a relatively new phenomenon			1
the sport was only introduced at the @entity76 games in 2000 after a successful trial at @entity78 four years previously			2
more than 80 sailors have taken part in over six days of competition , in three separate classes culminating in today 's final crucial races			2
but , perhaps inevitably , @entity10 sailing is a complicated sport to both compete in and to judge			1
both men and women sail in the same classes but are classified by the severity of their disability -- an issue that has caused many controversies both at this @entity10 and in disabled sport in general			0
a score of one is given to most severely disabled , seven for the least			0
" we have classifiers who are physios and doctors , but they know all about the rules of sailing , " explained @entity96 , president of the @entity97			2
" when we selected the particular boat ( class to be raced at the @entity10 ) we said that one should be female and the other male and that one has to be a class one or two disability , like being a quadrapligic			0
the more severely disabled sailor tends to be on the helm			2
" but it has been the technological advances in recent years that have allowed the more severely disabled sailors compete			1
" it is the adaptations ( to the boat ) that allow them to compete and have an even level , " says @entity96			2
" with the sonar ( boats ) , disabled sailors are not able to get from one side to the other			0
so now there 's a transferring seat -- a ' traveler ' -- so the sailor can now move more freely			2
the adaptations have really allowed them to compete , and compete in able - bodied sailing too			1
" the freedom of the sea the final day of competition is likely to be the most watched event in @entity10 sailing history			1
only a handful of nations compete and @entity96 wants to capitalize on the sport 's growing success			2
" we also include people with visual impairments and we are now folding blind sailing into the sport , " @entity96 said			0
" we are growing and we do have a development segment of our organization to help countries to move in and spread the word			0
" that should not be too difficult to achieve			0
after all , disabled sailing is an easier sell than many sports given that it has one huge advantage over the others : the freedom of the sea			0
" that 's the beauty of sailing , " says @entity96			0
and when you come to the @entity10 sailing you ca n't see what the disabilities are			0
" it gives you freedom and the ability to compete			0
" follow the final day 's @entity10 sailing action on our live blog -- as the @entity14 compete with @entity170 , @entity171 and the @entity172 for the top spot .			1
