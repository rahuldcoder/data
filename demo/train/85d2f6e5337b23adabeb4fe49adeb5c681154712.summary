-- the son of disgraced @entity3 politician @entity2 says the laundry list of allegations leveled against his father contradicts " everything i have come to know about him throughout my life			1
" @entity2 was once considered a top contender for the @entity11 , the team of nine politicians who effectively rule @entity3			1
but last week , the @entity13 relieved him of his duties and expelled him			0
he also faces possible criminal charges in connection with the murder of a @entity21 businessman , a crime for which is wife has been convicted			0
on saturday , @entity2 's son , @entity23 , posted a statement on @entity25 , a microblogging site , where he defended his " upright " father			1
the statement made no mention of his mother			2
" personally , it is hard for me to believe the allegations announced against my father , because they contradict everything i have come to know about him throughout my life , " the younger @entity2 wrote			1
" although the policies my father enacted are open to debate , the father i know is upright in his beliefs and devoted to duty			2
" in an e-mail to @entity0 on sunday , the son declined to comment further on the case			2
he said his statement posted to @entity25 was all he could say at the moment			1
the statement followed news friday by the state - run @entity50 new agency that the elder @entity2 had been expelled from the @entity13 and faced prosecution on criminal charges			1
the @entity50 report on his expulsion painted a portrait of corruption , abuse of power and improper sexual relationships			1
the party said the politician made " severe mistakes " in the killing of the @entity21 businessman and a diplomatic incident involving a police official , @entity50 reported			2
investigators cited influence peddling , bribery and womanizing , new details found in the course of the party 's investigation			0
" @entity2 had or maintained improper sexual relationships with a number of women , " the state news agency said			1
he also took advantage of his power to seek profits and received bribes , and his family " accepted a huge amount of money and property from others , " @entity50 said			2
the son said he could not reconcile the man accused of such acts and the man he knows as his father			1
" he has always taught me to be my own person and to have concern for causes greater than ourselves			0
i have tried to follow his advice , " he said in the statement			2
" at this point , i expect the legal process to follow its normal course , and i will await the result			0
" the elder @entity2 is a charismatic , albeit controversial , politician who launched a " smashing black , singing red " campaign in the southwestern city of @entity107 that promoted communist ideology and zealously cracked down on organized crime			1
his economic programs , which included millions spent on social welfare , made him a popular leader in @entity107			0
but analysts say his populist policies and high - profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the more economically liberal and reform - oriented faction that dominates the current party leadership			0
the politician 's fortunes changed when news surfaced this year that his wife , @entity122 , was a suspected accomplice in the poisoning of businessman @entity124			1
@entity124 died in november in @entity107 , where the elder @entity2 was the @entity13 chief			1
his death was originally blamed on excessive alcohol consumption			0
the politician was soon stripped of his top posts for " serious breach of discipline			1
" in august , his wife received a suspended death sentence after a seven - hour trial			0
the case also put the son under scrutiny as reports emerged over his lavish student lifestyle			0
photographs of him bare - chested with his arms around women at a party at the @entity143 were widely published and received badly in @entity3			0
the father defended his son when the reports first came out , accusing people of trying to make the 24 - year - old look bad			1
the younger @entity2 graduated from @entity150 's @entity149 in may			2
he previously attended the @entity143 , graduating in 2010			0
@entity151 , the former police chief of @entity107 , set off the controversial story on february 6 , when he fled to the @entity154 @entity153 in @entity155 and told @entity154 diplomats that @entity122 was a suspected accomplice in a murder case			0
after his request for asylum was turned down , @entity151 left the consulate and was taken away by @entity3 officials			0
but his accusations rocked the world 's most populous nation			0
@entity151 last week was sentenced to 15 years for defection , cover - up , bribe taking and abuse of power			1
@entity0 's @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
