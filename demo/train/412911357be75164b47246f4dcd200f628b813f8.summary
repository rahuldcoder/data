" the ceremony came less than a month after the @entity134 administration announced it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the @entity142 as children if they meet certain requirements			1
" it brings me great joy and inspiration because it reminds us that we are a country that is bound together not simply by ethnicity or blood lines , but by fidelity to a set of ideas , " @entity134 said			1
