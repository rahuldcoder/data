-- @entity1 likes to keep them guessing			1
three days after the @entity4 manager hinted he was on his way back to @entity6 and @entity7 , the self - proclaimed " @entity9 " insisted his future was still undecided			1
@entity1 signed a contract extension until 2016 with @entity4 last may after ending @entity12 's three - year stranglehold on @entity13 , but his relationship with the @entity16 press soured and he has clashed with @entity4 and @entity18 's much - loved keeper , @entity17			1
" when i decide on my future , my wife and kids will be the first to know , then the president and general director , " @entity1 told reporters ahead of @entity4 's game against @entity21			1
" i have n't decided to leave			1
if i go , i will not give explanations			0
" despite @entity1 's pronouncement friday , @entity6 's @entity29 newspaper claimed that he has already agreed to return to @entity7 but that an official announcement was unlikely until july 1			1
on tuesday following @entity4 's exit in the @entity34 semifinals for a third straight season under @entity1 , this time to @entity36 , the 50 - year - old , not for the first time , spoke of his deep fondness for @entity6			1
" i know in @entity6 i am loved , " @entity1 said			2
i know i am loved by the fans			0
i am loved by the media that treats me in a fair way , criticizing me when they have to , but giving me credit when i deserve it			0
i know i am loved by some clubs , especially one			0
" @entity47 boss @entity46 , who worked under his fellow @entity48 and formerly managed @entity7 , said @entity1 resurfacing in the @entity49 would be " spectacular			1
" with @entity1 at the helm , @entity7 ended a 50 - year title drought and won back - to - back @entity49 titles			1
he parted company with @entity7 in 2007 when his relationship with @entity57 owner @entity56 deteriorated			2
even though the @entity59 won the @entity34 in 2012 , they finished sixth in the league , failed to advance from this season 's group stage and are in danger of not qualifying for the competition next term			0
current interim manager @entity66 has already stated he wo n't be with @entity7 in 2013/2014			1
" i have always left clubs in the right way , " @entity1 added friday			1
" even @entity7 , which seemed controversial , was n't so much			1
when i go i never say anything negative about those clubs , quite the opposite			0
the day i go i will be wishing @entity4 the best for the future			2
" clubs always stay with me			0
@entity7 did not win the @entity34 with me but i was just as pleased when they won it			2
@entity4 will always be special and i want them to win their 10th @entity34			2
if that 's with me , fine			0
if not , i will enjoy it as much			0
" he said his past successes -- which include capturing titles in four countries , the @entity34 with @entity79 and steering @entity4 to a record points total last season -- have hurt him in the @entity16 capital			1
once he ended @entity12 's reign in @entity13 in 2012 , the goal with @entity4 was to win the @entity34 , which has n't materialized			2
@entity4 's title drought in the @entity34 now extends to 11 years			2
" it is my fault , " @entity1 said			0
" i have won so , so , so much that it is hard to live up to those expectations			0
but the points record in the league is mine and no one can take that away			0
" in a move sure not to boost his popularity in @entity18 , @entity1 took a swipe at @entity17 , who has n't reclaimed his position as @entity4 's no. 1 from @entity98 after recovering from a hand injury			1
" i should have been more proactive at the end of the first season , more demanding and more insistent , " @entity1 said			2
" we should have brought in @entity98 then			0
i asked but he did n't come			0
i did n't do enough to bring him in and that 's a pity			0

@entity1 says he has n't decided where he *'ll* be managing next season
an @entity110 newspaper , though , reports that he has agreed to rejoin @entity7
@entity1 insists he has always left his clubs on good terms , including @entity7
@entity1 takes a swipe at *longtime* @entity4 and @entity18 *goalkeeper* @entity17
