@entity0 -- army master sgt. @entity2 , 36 , was on his 10th tour of duty in the war zones of @entity6 and @entity7 when he was killed thursday in a remote area of eastern @entity6			1
few details are available on the circumstances that led to the death of the highly decorated soldier , from @entity13 , @entity14			0
however , a @entity16 military official has now confirmed to @entity1 that @entity2 was the only @entity16 casualty of a brutal two - day firefight against an @entity20 - related group that erupted when @entity16 and @entity6 troops attacked an insurgent encampment , killing nearly 80 foreign fighters			1
that single piece of information is a rare glimpse into the world of @entity16 special operations forces who have done more tours than most in the last decade			1
special forces tours of duty typically last six to eight months , compared to regular combat tours of one year			1
many troops have spent more time away from home than at home , but little is said about what they do these days in fighting insurgent strongholds			0
the official who confirmed @entity2 was part of this raid declined to be named because he was discussing the @entity43 's @entity42			0
@entity2 was part of a @entity16 and @entity6 special operations mission that went in to attack the area in @entity6 's @entity47			1
the camp they attacked and the fighters there were part of the so - called @entity54 network , which is responsible for many recent attacks in @entity6 and is closely tied to @entity20			1
the @entity56 traditionally rely on @entity6 and @entity58 fighters , but in this instance most of the fighters there who were killed were @entity61 and @entity62 , brought into @entity6 from @entity58			2
that alone is a worrisome trend			0
a second @entity16 military official tells @entity1 that the @entity16 is seeing the @entity56 increasingly turn to foreign fighters they bring into @entity6			2
" this is how they are expanding their capabilities , " the official said			0
the @entity16 believes this camp was an assembly and training point for these foreign fighters to stage attacks across @entity6			2
during the two - day firefight against the camp , the @entity16 troops found several caves and fortified bunkers			1
airstrikes were called in using missile - equipped helicopters , fighter jets dropping precision weapons and unmanned drones			0
coalition forces were led to the camp by former insurgents , but it 's not clear if the extent of the opposition was immediately clear to the coalition			0
when the dust finally cleared , @entity2 was the only fatality			0
the @entity16 military , still cloaked in secrecy , wo n't say how he perished .			2

man who died in firefight was on 10th tour of duty
@entity20 - linked group has expanded its network of fighters
special ops forces tend to do more tours than other divisions
@entity16 *remains* tight - *lipped* about special ops
