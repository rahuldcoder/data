-- @entity2 's announcement that the @entity3 will hold a referendum on @entity6 membership if his party wins another election has sparked strong reaction from @entity0 commenters on what the move could mean for @entity3 and @entity13			1
@entity2 , who gave his remarks in a speech in @entity16 on wednesday , said " difficult questions " needed to be asked about @entity3 's membership in the @entity6 , otherwise @entity3 people could " drift towards the exit " as @entity13 fails			1
he also asserted the @entity3 people 's right to a choice about whether to remain in the @entity6 on the basis of a renegotiated settlement , or to leave			1
some praised @entity2 for a bold move that they argued protected @entity3 interests and reasserted the nation 's power			1
" no member state should agree to be part of the @entity6 if it considers the terms and long term prospects to not be in its favor , why should it ? " argued @entity31			2
" [ @entity37 ] is fighting for what the @entity3 needs and sees the value in being part of a strong @entity13 , but ultimately [ also ] the impact of losing control of the @entity43 and being subject to the voting whims of countries that do n't understand the island economy			1
" @entity47 agreed , saying he saw " a lot of sense and potential leadership in @entity2 's speech "			1
" the @entity6 needs changes and if it changes for the worse ( which is possible with the current level of democratic accountability ) , then the @entity3 should , and will , waste no time in changing direction , " he said			2
but others decried the decision as a bluff , or a move to pander to more skeptical elements in @entity2 's own country -- and party -- and questioned whether the move was part of a genuine desire for change in the @entity6			1
" this is a statement of populist politics and fear of losing his chair			0
they will never leave the @entity6 , " said commenter @entity73 can the @entity75 recover in 2013 some also felt that the move was unfair for other nation members of the @entity6			2
" i am not opposed to change in the @entity6 , but this change can not be dictated by the @entity3 ( or any other single state for that matter ) , " said commenter @entity78			2
" it has to come via a democratic process in which all member states are able to represent their individual standpoints			0
threatening to leave the @entity6 in case they do not conform with your ideas ... is not the way			0
" the " @entity13 question " has long dominated @entity3 politics and proved a constant headache for successive @entity3 prime ministers			1
@entity2 has also faced heavy pressure in recent months from some members of his own party to hold a referendum on @entity6 membership			1
but political rivals , and other factions within his own party , fear that the move could prove poor timing as the country struggles to emerge from its financial troubles			0
commenter maxb500 echoed these concerns , describing the move as " laughable at best " and potentially catastrophic for the @entity3 's slumping economy			1
" you wonder why @entity2 thinks he can single handily direct the whole @entity6 what direction to take , while always giving insult after insult after insult about its existence , the @entity118 currency and much more			2
" @entity13 's decade of boom and bust other commenters were even more cynical " typical @entity124 whining and bluffing , " scoffed commenter @entity122			2
" they think they play at poker ? game over			0
" while @entity130 dismissed @entity2 's move as pure politicking , others wondered whether instability would be the result of any decision to leave the union			1
@entity137 , a @entity3 national living in @entity139 , said questions had to be asked about what @entity2 was " offering for sustainability in the way of moving forward " , and feared the result of any economic uncertainty			1
" if the economy dives , the violence we saw in the riots in the cities just recently in @entity124 will be ten fold in comparison to the fall out which could follow , " said			0
" add that to the cuts in policing [ and ] you have a major recipe for disaster			0
" @entity2 used his speech to talk of an " updated " union , which he envisioned as flexible , adaptable , open and " fit for the challenges of the modern age "			0
his remarks echoed those of some commenters , who argued , as commenter @entity167 « l @entity165 did , that the real problem could be the @entity6 itself			2
" the problem with the @entity6 is that they want to become the new @entity174 , but they ca n't understand it would be never that way , because we are too different from each other , " he wrote			0
" the @entity6 is a patchwork , a forced patchwork of different people , different cultures and different ways of thinking			0
how can you hope to harmonize it ? " commenter @entity184 was even harsher in assessment , asking whether the institution itself , which won the 2012 @entity189 peace prize , was rapidly falling into obsolescence			0
" the @entity6 is a project , i.e. a colony of @entity193			0
sooner or later it will fall apart , " he said .			0
