-- four doses of rabies vaccine are enough to prevent infection in most kids exposed to the deadly virus , according to a new policy statement from the nation 's largest organization of pediatricians			1
between 20,000 and 40,000 people in the @entity11 receive the rabies vaccine each year , usually after being bitten by an animal			1
the standard vaccine regimen has been five shots over a 28 - day period , but recent research has shown that the vaccine works in just four ( or even three ) shots			1
the @entity19 is now recommending that children who have potentially been exposed to rabies receive four shots in two weeks			1
( children with weakened immune systems should continue to receive the five - shot regimen , the group says			1
) this recommendation affirms a set of 2010 guidelines for all ages from the @entity31			0
@entity0 : 12 vaccines your child needs the policy change is designed in part to avoid shortages of the vaccine , says @entity39 , @entity40 , a professor and pediatrician at the @entity42 , in @entity43 , who helped write the policy statement in this week 's issue of the journal @entity47			0
the most recent such shortage , in 2009 , required public health officials to ration rabies shots			2
the change will also minimize the small chance of side effects ( such as hives and swelling ) associated with the vaccine , says @entity56 , @entity40 , an epidemic intelligence service officer in the @entity31 's rabies department			2
" it 's a very safe vaccine , but at the same time it does carry some risks , " he says			0
" we want to limit the number of doses we 're giving to people			0
" lowering the dose will also save nearly $ 17 million a year in health - care costs , the @entity31 estimates			0
@entity0 : 8 ways to make shots easier for kids the rabies virus causes brain swelling that is almost always fatal , but the vaccine is 100 % effective when given in time			2
in the @entity11 , just two to three people are infected with rabies each year			1
rates of rabies in the @entity11 began falling in the 1950s , when local governments began requiring that dogs be vaccinated against the disease			2
most states now require cats to get the shots too			0
wild animals -- especially bats -- are by far the most common cause of rabies exposure in the @entity94 bites , which typically occur when a person finds a bat in his home and tries to shoo it out , are responsible for 80 % of cases in which the vaccine is given , @entity39 says			1
" bats are about the size of mice and they have very small teeth , and so if you have a bat fly into you or bump you , that bat may have just bitten you and you may not appreciate it , " he says			0
" the bat bite looks like a staple wound , and that 's enough to get rabies into you and kill you			0
" @entity0 : vaccines adults need now for nearly a century after @entity109 invented it in 1885 , the rabies vaccine was made from ground - up animal brains and spinal cords			1
these vaccines -- " really scary things , which were designed to prevent an even scarier disease , " @entity39 says -- were painful and dangerous , causing serious neurological damage in about 1 in every 1,000 people who received them			0
they were n't very potent , however , so as many as 21 of the shots were required			0
in the 1970s , the first vaccines made from weakened rabies virus grown in cell culture became available			0
these shots , which are still used today , are much safer and more effective than the old - fashioned rabies shots , and are delivered into the upper arm or thigh			2
children are much more likely than adults to be exposed to rabies			0
kids are less likely to fear wild animals , @entity39 says , and because of their small stature , they are more likely to be bitten in the face or neck , which means the virus can travel to the brain much more quickly			1
a key strategy for protecting kids against rabies is to teach them a healthy fear of wild animals , he adds			1
" wild animals are to be admired from a distance , and not approached or picked up			1
