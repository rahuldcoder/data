@entity1 , @entity0 -- prosecutors have dismissed all four charges against @entity6 , brother of former @entity0 gov. @entity7 , defense attorney @entity3 said thursday			1
" i was in shock and still am , " @entity3 said			2
he said that when he told his client , @entity6 said , " ' oh , my @entity10 ; oh , my @entity10			1
' and i told him , ' you 're done			2
' his wife is hysterical			2
" @entity3 said prosecutors told a judge at a hearing thursday that they were dropping the charges because of " the disparity in the roles between @entity6 and @entity7 " and " in the interests of justice			1
" on august 17 , after deliberating for 14 days , a jury in a federal corruption trial convicted @entity7 of lying to the @entity23 but said they were deadlocked on the other 23 counts against the former governor as well as the four against @entity6			1
prosecutors have vowed to retry @entity7 , who faced charges including racketeering , wire fraud , attempted extortion and bribery			1
the two - term @entity32 was removed from office in january 2009 amid accusations that he attempted to sell the @entity36 seat that @entity37 held before he was elected president			2
the former governor will be retried after the first of 2011 , said his lead attorney , @entity40 @entity40 indicated that he is not happy at the limit placed on the number of federally funded attorneys on @entity7 's legal team			1
@entity7 qualifies for a public defender , @entity47 district judge @entity46 said , and he will appoint two attorneys and possibly a paralegal , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity50			1
a pro bono attorney is allowed , but @entity7 must disclose the source of the funds if he has any paid representation , @entity46 said , according to @entity50			1
the last trial was funded with nearly $ 3 million in campaign money			0
" you saw what happened in court			0
we 're now down one defendant , one less charge , and we 're down about eight lawyers , " @entity40 said			0
he said he thought @entity46 was wrong to say he could appoint only two attorneys			2
attorneys in the case have gone through piles of papers and listened to hours of taped conversations			2
" we have millions of documents to go over			0
we had 20 people working full - time on this case , " he said			0
@entity40 said his next step will be to sit down with the former governor and " decide what is best for him			0
... that 's the only question that is important			0
" defense attorney @entity78 said prosecutors should now dismiss the case against @entity7			1
@entity40 said it could still happen , noting , " the government has done some strange things in this case already			0
" the former governor " is innocent of any crime , " @entity40 said			0
" you 've got to keep that in mind			0
" he said he is open to discussions with prosecutors , but has not been approached			0
@entity40 said he had not spoken to @entity7 and did n't know what his reaction would be to prosecutors dropping charges against his brother			1
@entity6 was charged with one count of wire fraud , one count of extortion conspiracy , one count of attempted extortion , and one count of bribery conspiracy			1
asked why prosecutors dismissed charges against @entity6 , @entity3 said , " i did n't ask , but i 'm not going to argue with them			1
" " what he 's been through , and what he thought he was going to go through again , and then out of nowhere , they dismiss the charges ... i 've been doing this a long time , and things like this do n't happen , " the attorney said			2
but " the evidence was far from great against him , " @entity3 said			0
" i 'm sure they know the jury was 9 - 3 for acquittal			2
" he said he was told that six women on the jury refused to convict @entity6 in any circumstances			1
he said @entity6 could be subpoenaed in his brother 's retrial			1
during the first trial , @entity6 testified his brother was " trying to politically work something to his benefit " in handling the @entity36 appointment , but was thinking in terms of political horse - trading , not corruption			1
in a conversation recorded by federal agents , the then - governor told an aide , " i 've got this thing , and it 's [ expletive ] golden			0
i 'm just not giving it up for [ expletive ] nothing			0
" " it did n't seem out of the ordinary , because @entity37 was taking a lot of people from @entity0 with him to @entity142 , " said @entity6 , who raised money for his brother			1
he said his brother " was interested in the idea of being the head of @entity145			0
" while awaiting trial , the ousted governor repeatedly asserted his innocence in interviews and on @entity150 , as well as during his appearances on the " @entity153 " reality show			0

4 charges against @entity6 are dropped
attorneys for former gov. @entity7 are to meet with him
@entity6 could be subpoenaed in the retrial
@entity7 was convicted on one count ; the jury deadlocked on 23 others
