@entity0 -- for both presidential campaigns , @entity4 @entity3 's choice of @entity6 congressman and conservative star @entity7 as his running mate was like @entity10 come early			1
conservatives wanted one of their own on @entity3 's ticket and they got that in @entity7 , who has emerged as their ideological leader on the @entity17 on fiscal and budget matters			1
the choice also helps satisfy @entity4 strategists who felt @entity3 needed to not only stress how president @entity21 has failed in that role , but also better articulate what the @entity4 candidate would do if elected			1
" @entity7 is a great choice			2
he energizes an already motivated party to a further degree and will help clarify the differing visions between the two campaigns for the country , " said @entity26 , a @entity4 strategist who in 2007 was a senior adviser to @entity3 's presidential campaign			1
" there are big choices , and in making the selection , @entity3 is showing that he believes @entity36 is ready for the choice			1
" but @entity3 's choice of @entity7 also helps @entity21 better define what he 's running against -- his campaign immediately made the @entity6 congressman and his " extreme " budget a target and tied @entity3 's campaign to @entity7 's @entity46 @entity4 colleagues , who he says wants to get rid of regulations on big corporations and give more tax breaks to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class			1
@entity3 's introduction of @entity7 dominated the news over the weekend with debates of the @entity6 congressman 's policy positions playing over the visuals of @entity59 and @entity60 appearing together in front of large crowds			1
in many ways , @entity7 is an " in - your - face " choice , said @entity65 , a @entity6 native , @entity4 strategist and partner at the political communications firm @entity68			1
@entity7 's selection forces the @entity21 campaign to pivot from attacks on @entity3 's tenure at private equity firm @entity73 and refusal to release more tax returns and focus instead on debating solutions to shore up the ailing economy			1
@entity3 has campaigned largely on being critical of @entity21 's performance in office			2
however , this summer @entity3 has been hampered from expanding the conversation to the economy because he had to fend off the @entity21 campaign 's questions about tax records and attacks on the former @entity87 governor 's private sector record			2
the days leading up to the @entity7 announcement had shown that the attacks were having an effect : @entity21 appeared to be opening up a lead in most head - to - head polls			0
but even more troubling , @entity3 's unfavorable numbers were creeping up after weeks of attacks by the @entity21 campaign and those supporting it			1
@entity7 's conservative stance extends beyond fiscal policy " the choice of @entity7 allows the campaign to better paint a picture of exactly what the campaign believes in terms of fiscal responsibility , " said @entity65 , who first became familiar with @entity7 while working in congressional leadership offices			1
" the @entity21 campaign started to define @entity3 and began to create a negative choice between the two campaigns			2
picking @entity7 hits the reset button for the campaign			0
it resets the campaign on policy terms			0
it takes away the politics of personal destruction that @entity21 was using and resets the campaign to talk about the two policy visions			0
" but there are pitfalls for the @entity4 ticket in picking @entity7			0
@entity7 's controversial entitlement reform plan , " @entity124 " -- proposes a partially privatized @entity126 program for future seniors			1
instead of automatic enrollment in the government health care program for seniors , @entity7 would give older @entity36 the option of buying into @entity126 - approved plans with " premium support " payments or vouchers , as @entity136 have described them			1
it is a proposal that @entity3 has not fully embraced , telling surrogates in a talking points memo obtained by @entity1 on saturday : " gov. @entity3 applauds @entity7 for going in the right direction with his budget , and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance			1
" @entity21 was quick to pounce on @entity7 as a veep choice			2
his selection makes the race a choice between two starkly different visions of the future in the country , the president said			0
" my opponent and congressman @entity7 and their allies in @entity157 -- they all believe that if we just get rid of more regulations on big corporations and we give more tax breaks to the wealthiest @entity36 , it will lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody else			2
that is what they are proposing , " @entity21 said at a fundraiser in his hometown of @entity169 on sunday			0
" that is where they will take us if they win			0
it 's on their websites and embodied in the budget that the @entity184 voted for repeatedly			0
" @entity21 campaign senior adviser @entity185 said on @entity1 's " @entity186 " on sunday that @entity7 is a " perfectly genial and bright guy , " but at the same time a " right - wing ideologue , and that is reflected in the positions that he 's taken			2
" on monday , @entity185 compared @entity3 's and @entity7 's budget plans			1
" for the middle class it feels like a choice between a punch in the nose and a knee to the groin , " he told @entity191			0
" the fact is both plans call for trillions and trillions of dollars of new tax cuts skewed to the wealthy			0
" it 's a refrain @entity136 will try to hammer home in the weeks leading up to the @entity205 , said @entity206 , a professor of political management at @entity209 's @entity208			0
" the @entity136 are trying to paint @entity7 as an ardent conservative outside the mainstream of the @entity36 in a way that they 've not been able to make stick with @entity3 , " @entity206 said			1
" this allows them to say ' when you buy @entity3 , you buy a whole party with a whole philosophy that brings us back to the economic crisis of 2008			0
' " @entity21 's campaign and its surrogates jumped on @entity7 's controversial plans for entitlement programs as written in the @entity4 budget plan that he authored			1
@entity4 say the cuts are necessary to bring down debt , but @entity136 say the cuts shift the burden of safety - net programs to the middle - class and the elderly			0
for all the energy and enthusiasm that @entity7 brings to the ticket , those positions might make it harder for @entity3 because they could split the coalition that @entity4 have made with blue - collar voters and the elderly , said @entity241 , a @entity1 contributor and editorial director of @entity244			2
" the modern @entity4 coalition is much more dependent than it used to be on both blue - collar and older voters , " @entity241 said monday on @entity1 's " @entity248			0
" while they do n't like welfare , food stamps and other " transfer programs , " said @entity241 , " they are much more supportive of middle - class entitlements			0
" indeed , @entity21 's campaign posted a web ad in @entity257 ahead of @entity3 's bus tour through that state on monday -- without @entity7 , who was campaigning on his own in @entity261 -- pointing out what it says would be the costs to seniors if @entity126 became the voucher program that @entity7 advocates in his budget plan			1
for the next few weeks , both parties will battle over defining @entity7 and what he stands for , @entity206 said			0
a @entity1 / @entity271 survey taken august 7 - 8 , showed 54 % of those polled saying they did n't know enough about @entity7 to form an opinion " he is kind of the proverbial blank slate on which both sides are trying to write their message as the public try to figure out who he is , " @entity206 said			2
@entity1 's @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 contributed to this report			0

both sides got what they wanted in @entity3 's choice of @entity7 as his running mate
conservatives *celebrate* @entity7 's selection ; choice helps shore up some support for @entity3
*democrats* quick to attack @entity7 's selection as proof of @entity3 's conservative vision
political experts say both sides will battle over how to introduce @entity7 to @entity36 public
