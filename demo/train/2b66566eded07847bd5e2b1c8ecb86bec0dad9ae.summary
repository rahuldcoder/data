@entity0 , @entity1 -- stopping short of directly addressing intensifying speculation about a @entity7 phone , @entity4 's @entity3 acknowledged that its portable game system could be due for a change soon			1
@entity3 , the senior vice president of marketing at @entity10 , was asked about the so - called @entity11 , which was first reported by @entity12 , in a fireside chat wednesday at a conference in @entity0			1
refusing to confirm or deny rumors , @entity3 did say the lack of a cellular data connection could be holding back @entity4 's @entity19 game system			1
" the psp is a @entity21 device , " he said			1
" people are used to having always - connected devices			0
" @entity4 's home game consoles have had life spans of 10 years each , and the @entity26 will continue to be supported for at least that long , @entity3 said			1
but " the portable market moves so fast , " he said			0
at six years , the @entity19 may be looking dry			1
indeed , @entity4 has had to reverse its marketing strategy to target younger gamers for that system , @entity3 said			1
now , the @entity19 is having to compete with more fully featured hand - held game systems that can also make calls , send text messages and provide a window to thousands of games and apps			1
@entity38 chief @entity37 has boasted in news conferences , saying the @entity40 and @entity41 have become the hand - held gaming leaders			0
the company recently launched a social networking hub called @entity45			0
however , @entity3 said @entity4 has competitors , like @entity38 's @entity41 and @entity48 's @entity47 , beat for the attention of serious gamers			1
@entity19 's focus is on long , immersive entertainment , not five - minute battles between meetings			1
" these are largely time - killers , " @entity3 said of smartphone games			0
" gamers are n't satisfied with that			0
" whether @entity4 sees @entity47 's gaming marketplace as a competitor or potential partner , @entity3 declined to comment			1
@entity12 reported that @entity47 could power the rumored @entity11			2
a spokeswoman present during a @entity2 interview with @entity3 after the onstage chat said , " we have relationships with @entity48			0
" the @entity19 can already do more than just gaming , @entity3 said			2
it has applications for watching movies , making calls over @entity71 and limited web browsing			0
but many of those functions are limited by whether you have @entity21 access			2
plus , it 's not a phone , so you need to carry multiple gadgets			0
but that could be a selling point , said @entity3			0
" consumers like different boxes , " he said			0
@entity4 's goal for the @entity85 -- the online component for gaming and downloading video of which @entity3 is also the senior vice president -- is to be an entertainment centerpiece and be always accessible			2
the current @entity19 does n't quite fulfill that vision			2
" i do n't think we fully realize that vision with a @entity21 device , " @entity3 told @entity2			2
" if it 's not connected [ to a cell network ] then it does sort of limit people			0

a @entity4 *executive* declined to address rumors about the @entity11
he indicated that the @entity19 system could be due for a change
specifically , only connecting to the internet via @entity21 can be limiting , he said
