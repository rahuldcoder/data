-- did @entity1 die eight years ago of natural causes or was the 75 - year - old @entity4 leader poisoned , as his widow believes ? that 's the question forensic investigators from at least three nations are trying to answer by testing samples taken from @entity1 's body , which was exhumed tuesday and reburied a short time later			1
tests are being performed on those samples for the presence of polonium -- a toxic , radioactive element found on some of his personal belongings earlier this year			1
for five decades , @entity1 was the most prominent face of @entity4 opposition to @entity21 , first as the head of the @entity23 , which carried out attacks against @entity21 targets , and later as the head of the @entity27			1
the @entity27 , which runs the @entity28 , says it is convinced @entity21 is behind any poisoning of @entity1			1
" we had nothing to do with it , " @entity21 government spokesman @entity30 told @entity0 's @entity31			1
" those charges are ludicrous and it 's conspiracy theories which , as you know , sometimes have legs of their own			2
but , as you know , there is no truth in it whatsoever			0
" @entity43 authorities -- responding to a request from his widow -- opened a murder inquiry into @entity1 's death this year after high levels of polonium - 210 were detected on @entity1 's toothbrush , clothing and his keffiyeh , the trademark black - and - white headscarf he often wore			1
@entity43 opened the investigation partly because @entity1 died there in 2004			2
while @entity43 is leading the investigation , forensic experts from @entity56 and @entity57 took their own samples for independent analysis			0
' proof in our hands ' @entity1 's widow , @entity64 , told @entity0 on tuesday that she does n't feel comfortable accusing a person or a country of poisoning her husband , but she wants the investigators to keep working			1
" i will tell you everybody is accusing @entity21 , " she told @entity0 's @entity69			1
" i ca n't just conclude without having all the proof in our hands			2
" @entity69 asked the widow whether she regrets turning down a chance to have her husband 's body undergo an autopsy when he died			1
@entity64 said it never occurred to her to have one performed			0
" nobody asked me to do an autopsy , " she said			0
@entity27 president @entity82 subsequently approved the exhumation from @entity1 's mausoleum in the @entity4 presidential compound in the @entity28 city of @entity87			1
but the presence of high levels of polonium - 210 on his belongings does not mean @entity1 was poisoned , according to @entity91 , director of the @entity56 institute that carried out the tests			2
some details in @entity1 's medical records are not consistent with polonium poisoning , he explained , and " the only way to resolve this anomaly would be by testing the body			1
" so what is @entity102 and how does it work ? @entity103 is not a radioactive substance that emits gamma particles , which can travel through walls at extremely high energies			0
instead , as polonium - 210 decays , it releases alpha particles , which ca n't even pass through a piece of paper			0
but alpha particles are still dangerous			0
they travel short distances and retain a high amount of energy			0
bottom line : it may be very difficult to determine if @entity1 was poisoned with the substance , but taking samples was less of a task			2
this week experts retrieved the samples from @entity1 's body without disturbing the whole of him so officials would not have to do a military reburial as was planned , according to @entity127 , head of a @entity4 investigation committee			1
@entity4 leadership placed flowers at @entity1 's mausoleum , @entity127 told reporters			1
poisoning rumors for @entity64 , that event was difficult to watch			0
" i will tell you something very emotional today while i was seeing his , you know , reburial and his remains , " she told @entity69			0
" i thought i would promise all my @entity4 people that his remains will go ... to @entity143 , as he always wanted to be buried in the @entity144 in @entity143			2
" @entity1 died at age 75 at a @entity147 military hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma			2
@entity4 officials said in the days before his death that @entity1 had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems			1
rumors of poisoning circulated at the time , but @entity4 officials denied them , and then - foreign minister @entity157 said he " totally " ruled them out			1
two weeks after @entity1 's death , his nephew said medical records showed no cause of death			1
@entity163 , who was the @entity4 observer to the @entity164 , said toxicology tests showed " no known poison " -- though he refused to exclude the possibility that poison caused his uncle 's death			1
" the suspicion that he was killed , that he was deliberately murdered , has been there all along and most @entity4 believe that , " said @entity173 , a member of the @entity23 's executive committee			1
" i personally believed it because i was with him ; i saw him ; i saw the transformation and it certainly was unnatural			0
" @entity173 said she had spoken with @entity1 's doctors , who told her that they could not rule out the possibility that he had been poisoned			1
" but we did n't have any kind of thread , any kind of evidence , " she told @entity0 in july			0
referring to the report that showed polonium - 210 on some of his belongings , @entity173 said it " in many ways , tells us our suspicions are founded that there is sufficient evidence to say that he was killed , that he was assassinated using polonium			0
" only a few countries , including the @entity195 , @entity21 and @entity57 , have stocks of polonium - 210 , a fact that would limit the list of possible suspects , according to @entity200 , a professor and toxicologist at the @entity204 's @entity203 and @entity205			2
" you would only use polonium if you were making a statement , not if you were trying to hide , " he said			0
someone trying to get away with murder would be better off using pharmaceutical agents , since a number of of them " disappear in the body " and can not be identified later , he said			0
" i ca n't figure out why they would use it , frankly , " he said			0
" there are so many really cool agents to kill people if you want to be secret and even if you want to make a statement			0
" polonium - 210 made headlines in 2006 , when it was used to kill @entity222 , a former @entity223 agent who came to @entity224 in 2000 after turning whistle - blower on the @entity226 , the @entity223 's successor			0
in a deathbed statement from a @entity230 hospital , @entity222 blamed @entity57 's president @entity231 , an accusation the @entity233 strongly denied			0
but it 's hard to compare the cases of @entity1 and @entity222 , who was diagnosed when he was alive , @entity234 said			2
@entity1 's symptoms when he died were not entirely consistent with polonium poisoning , he said			1
" for example , the bone marrow stayed in good shape until ( the ) death of @entity1			2
in other cases of polonium poisoning , there is a decaying of the bone marrow , " the medical expert said			0
" another point , he did not lose his hair as would be expected in the case of polonium ( poisoning )			0
" scientists performed more than 50 measurements on the belongings between february and june , he said			0
palestinians who view @entity1 as a symbol of resistance are also quite emotional about the suspicion he was poisoned			2
@entity1 won the @entity260 in 1994 , along with @entity21 leaders @entity262 and @entity263 , for their work on the @entity266 accords in 1993			1
the @entity266 agreement was perceived at the time as a breakthrough that could lead to an independent @entity4 state and a permanent peace with @entity21			1
@entity0 's @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
