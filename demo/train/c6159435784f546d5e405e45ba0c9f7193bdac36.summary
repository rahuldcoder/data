-- @entity3 owner @entity2 has until may 27 to respond to the @entity1 , which on monday " initiated a charge " seeking to terminate all ownership rights in the franchise , the @entity1 announced in a written statement			1
@entity2 , who owns the team with his wife , @entity9 , through a family trust , will also be allowed to make a presentation at a special board of governors meeting scheduled for june 3			2
however , attorney @entity14 has demanded on behalf of @entity15 that the @entity1 give the longtime owner a three - month extension to prepare his response , @entity13 reported monday night			1
the magazine , which like @entity0 is owned by @entity20 , said the @entity1 would reject the request			1
a receptionist at @entity14 's office told @entity0 she had been advised to give a " no comment " to all media inquiries involving @entity2			1
the @entity1 declined to comment on the @entity13 report			1
in order to terminate the @entity15 ' franchise rights , 75 % ( 23 ) of the 30 team owners would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale			0
because @entity2 is banned from any @entity1 activities , he is not allowed to vote , but the @entity3 will have a vote , the @entity1 said			1
@entity1 bylaws say that if @entity2 does n't respond in five business days or appear at a hearing , it will be deemed an admission to the " total validity " of the charge			1
if the owner does appear , he may be represented by a lawyer , but the @entity1 constitution says : " strict rules of evidence shall not apply , and all relevant and material evidence submitted prior to and at the hearing may be received and considered			2
" the 80 - year - old lawyer and billionaire real estate investor is already fighting a $ 2.5 million fine and a lifetime ban imposed by @entity1 commissioner @entity53			1
the longtime owner has argued he has been denied due process			0
the @entity1 included his failure to pay among the reasons for the charge			0
the league said it has been damaged by @entity2 's racist remarks to @entity61 that were posted online in april by @entity62 and in an interview with @entity0 's " @entity64 360			1
" " among other things , mr. @entity2 disparaged african - americans and ' minorities ' ; directed a female acquaintance not to associate publicly with african - americans or to bring african - americans to @entity3 games ; and criticized african - americans for not supporting their communities , " the statement said			2
in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's " @entity76 " last week , @entity2 talked about his relationship with @entity61 and racism in @entity79 , and he trashed @entity80 and other minorities			1
" that 's one problem i have			0
jews , when they get successful , they will help their people			0
and some of the african - americans , maybe i 'll get in trouble again , they do n't want to help anybody , " said @entity2 , who is @entity85			2
some owners said privately -- and @entity91 owner @entity90 said publicly -- after the scandal first unfolded that it would be difficult to vote on removing an owner for a personal conversation			0
@entity0 's @entity95 told @entity64 his interview has changed some minds , according to @entity1 insiders she had spoken with in the past week			1
" if there were any owners who were concerned about should we be kicking someone out for a private tape , ( they ) now feel more comfortable , " she said			0
" because @entity2 went on television with you and made statements that were abhorrent to so many people , they feel as if they are on much firmer ground to kick him out			0
" @entity2 's lawyer last week , @entity2 hired @entity14 , an antitrust lawyer who has worked with him in the past , to fight the @entity1			1
@entity110 has said she wants to keep an ownership stake in the team but does n't want to be the controlling partner			2
her attorney said she still hopes to resolve the " dispute with the @entity1			2
" " based on our initial assessment , we continue to believe there is no lawful basis for stripping @entity110 of her 50 percent ownership interest in the @entity3			0
she is the innocent estranged spouse , " @entity121 said			0
but the @entity1 said that @entity2 's remarks are deemed actions of the entire ownership group			1
in his interview with @entity64 , @entity2 repeatedly denied he is a racist but admitted he made a mistake making the remarks that were recorded			1
in the recording , which drew widespread condemnation from fans , players and the league after it appeared on @entity62 , @entity2 chastises @entity61 for posting pictures online of her posing with african - americans , including @entity1 legend @entity80			1
he tells her not to bring @entity80 to @entity3 games			0
" admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put ( @entity141 ) on an @entity142 for the world to have to see so they have to call me , " he said			0
" in your lousy f * * ing @entity148 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " he said during a different portion of the recording			0
@entity61 , who has largely avoided the media since the scandal began , is scheduled to appear on " @entity154 " on wednesday			0
she may have more to say about the developing situation at that time			0
@entity2 , who has owned the team since 1981 , said he was baited into saying those remarks			2
the @entity3 ' turbulent season ended late thursday in a 104 - 98 loss to @entity160			0
the @entity160 won the series four games to two			0
@entity163 , a former chairman of @entity164 and @entity20 , was tapped by the @entity1 to be the team 's interim chief executive			2
@entity15 : i 'm not a racist , i 'm a giver @entity80 : i 'm going to pray for @entity2 @entity0 's @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 contributed to this report .			1
