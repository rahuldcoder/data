-- are human beings set up to believe in a higher power ? some scientists say yes , based on either a " faith gene " or certain areas of the brain that light up on an mri when people pray or think about @entity9			1
but this is a highly destructive " yes , " because it reduces spirituality to a mechanical function like heart rate or the secretion of growth hormone			2
the same evidence fuels the arguments of atheists , who claim that if @entity9 is just a chemical reaction , it 's time we quit believing in a deity			1
at the very least , they say , we should stop glorifying @entity9 , now that he ( or she ) has been demoted far below the exalted status one finds in the @entity29 and the rest of world scriptures			1
@entity0 : why you 've got ta have faith i think atheists are getting a lot of mileage out of a facile argument			0
in 1896 , long before brain imaging and the discovery of @entity42 , the famous @entity44 philosopher and psychologist @entity39 published a lecture called " @entity46			1
" it contains one idea that is a revelation			0
@entity39 found a way for science to lead to @entity9 instead of defeating @entity9			1
let me give the revelation a context			0
@entity39 thought people had a right , perhaps even a drive , to say that @entity9 existed , and even though they could n't offer evidence for their religious beliefs , it sustained them with comfort , hope and so on			1
@entity0 : find religion without losing control atheists scoff at this rationale , claiming it 's childish to fall back on fairy tales about @entity9 just because they make you feel better			1
far better to grow up and see what 's before your eyes : the material world operating through random chance without the slightest sign of a higher intelligence , moral authority , afterlife and all the other trappings of religion			0
but @entity39 was ahead of this argument			1
@entity0 : the skeptic 's book club what , he asked , if believing in @entity9 actually makes new evidence appear ? that was the revelation , because while believing in ghosts or @entity86 wo n't make either one appear ( so far as we know ) , @entity9 is an aspect of our own consciousness			1
the deity is continuous with the human mind			0
when @entity96 said , " seek the @entity93 within , " he was pointing to this very continuity			0
i am paraphrasing @entity39 and to some extent going beyond his lecture			1
but what fascinates me is that he hit upon a familiar notion among seekers today : " you will only see it if you believe it			0
" to a non-believer , this sounds like self - hypnosis			0
being materialists , they cling to the old formulation : " i 'll believe it when i see it			0
" but no one ever claimed that @entity9 or higher intelligence or the creative principle in the universe was tangible , like a rock or a tree			1
gravity is n't tangible , either , but once the human mind decided to look for it , gravity became evident			0
@entity9 is subtler than gravity but just as evident , and just as dependent on knowing what to look for			1
@entity0 : who exactly is @entity9 ? to be clear , @entity39 ' belief is not the fervent belief of the religious fundamentalist who uses desperate literal interpretations of scripture to mask his insecurities and limited experience of the divine			1
this is the pragmatic belief of a working hypothesis applied toward improving one 's life			1
therefore , i do n't think it 's time to give up on believing			0
belief is a step ahead of hope			1
@entity146 can be desperate , empty or false			0
but when you step beyond hope into belief , you do something both real and positive			2
you say , " i believe in something , so let it appear			0
" in other words , you open yourself to knowledge , which is what everyone wants			2
belief is a halfway house			2
it opens your awareness to a new possibility , and then you find out whether @entity9 can actually be known			2
we have countless saints and sages to tell us that @entity9 can be known ; and with all their combined doubt , atheists , materialists and skeptics can not prove that @entity9 is unknowable			2
the whole issue depends not on religion versus science but on @entity39 's insight that the mind allows nature to reveal itself in greater depth the deeper we are willing to look			2
i find great encouragement in that insight and thought it was worth sharing			0
we can all benefit from @entity39 ' sort of pragmatism , which says @entity9 should be adopted as a working hypothesis , even when doubt exists , because as evidence emerges to support our belief , we will succeed in living better in this world			1
