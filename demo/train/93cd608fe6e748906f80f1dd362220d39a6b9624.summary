-- for @entity2 , it started so early that she ca n't quite recall how long ago it was			0
she does have a specific memory of enjoying the works of @entity6 at age 7			2
" i remember that my sister and i saw the @entity10 animated version of ' @entity11 , ' and then had the special deluxe @entity12 , " she said			2
" we listened to this dozens , if not hundreds , of times , memorizing every piece of music , every word of dialogue , every special effects sound			0
at such a young age , i was immune to the bigger picture of @entity6 's world -- it was enough for me to enjoy the kids ' story for what it was			1
" with 75 years of history to draw on , and an official @entity31 for 40 of those years , countless fans like @entity2 have begun their journeys with stories like this			1
in so many ways , @entity6 fandom has become a family affair			2
now an adult , @entity2 sees this week 's release of " @entity11 : an @entity40 , " as a chance for what she calls a " family reunion			1
" the retail worker from @entity45 will be joining 50 of her closest friends in @entity6 fandom , all traveling to @entity47 , @entity48 , to see the movie as a group			1
the town 's @entity51 holds a special place in the hearts of those in her large group , because they have held two gatherings there since 2008			1
they 're called " a @entity61 , " a term based on the first chapter of " @entity64			0
" the @entity51 , once home to a 19th century religious community , was seen as the perfect stand - in for the @entity69 ' shire from @entity6 's stories			1
" we had over a hundred attendees , for three days of music , laughter , love and ' @entity64 , ' " says @entity2 of the first gathering in 2008			0
" we thought of ourselves as the anti- ( fan ) convention -- no hurried crowds , no standing in lines for hours , no cold , lonely hotel rooms			0
" the lack of amenities was seen as a plus : " there was very little technology present -- some of the houses and rooms did not even have tv 's , @entity92 was only available in a couple of places , and there was little to any cell phone reception			2
in fact , it made the magic all the more real			0
we were in the @entity68			0
we were living in @entity6 's world , if only for a few days			1
" they plan to do it all over again in 2014 , but this weekend 's smaller gathering will be special as well			2
as at " a @entity61 , " many of them will attend the movie in costume			0
" it is something that most of us have been looking forward to for months			0
" @entity2 really started to appreciate @entity6 's work in her teen years , and was especially drawn to the character of @entity115 , a hero who dresses as a man in armor to fight in a battle in " @entity119			1
" " ( i admire ) her courage , her desperation , her need to love and be loved , her desire for honor and glory ' far above the mean things that crawl upon the @entity128 , ' " says @entity2			0
" i began to write stories about her as a teen , using her as a character of her future self , having finally found love and honor but always yearning for that little bit more			0
" like @entity2 's @entity115 , a particular @entity6 character captured the imagination of @entity137 of @entity138 : @entity139 , the elf portrayed by @entity141 in @entity143 's series of @entity6 films , starting with " @entity145			1
" she , too , plans to attend " @entity11 " in costume , but she has taken it a step further : costuming is now her business as well			2
@entity143 's " @entity64 " captivated her as a teenager in 2001 and she immediately sought out @entity6 's work in the library			1
but the costumes also stood out to her in a big way			0
" i made it a point to learn how to sew costumes due to how gorgeous the costume design was in this film , " she said			0
" i made a costume of @entity139 's that was five sizes too big , made from the completely wrong fabrics , and by all accounts was horrible ! but i loved it			0
i was so proud that i did hand - beading on the sleeves and i had grown my hair out to an elven length			2
and i had elf ears ! " in 2004 , she went to @entity45 's @entity168 and spent time with a cosplay group called " arms of middle - earth			1
" that 's where she met " a cute guy dressed as ' behind the scenes @entity176			0
' " she and her now - boyfriend work on @entity179 costuming , and , of course , have grand plans for " @entity11 " release			1
" i 've just completed a nearly screen - accurate @entity183 for a friend who looks , creepily , like @entity185 ! handmade down to the buttons			0
" costuming is n't the only thing @entity6 fans have in common			1
it 's quite literally a family affair for those who pass down a love of @entity6 stories from generation to generation			1
there is live - action @entity6 role - playing , where fans re-enact scenes from the book or create new ones			1
in preparation for the movie , fans are re-reading the book , creating flow charts identifying dwarves versus hobbits , putting on trivia contests , updating their cosplay progress , and that old standby , posting @entity213 photos of movie tickets			2
with " @entity11 " trilogy expected to be another box office behemoth , @entity6 fandom can only grow from here			1
