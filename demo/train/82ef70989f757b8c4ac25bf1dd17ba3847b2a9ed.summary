-- the @entity4 conflict has become " increasingly militarized " as killings and torture by regime security forces and anti-government fighters raged this spring , a @entity2 panel reported thursday			1
meanwhile , the @entity2 secretary - general said there is no fallback plan to deploying monitors to some of the @entity17 nation 's most embattled cities			1
@entity2 monitors on the ground in five @entity4 cities are making " all possible efforts to stop violence " and have had " some dampening effect , " @entity18 ban ki - moon told @entity0 's @entity24			1
but he conceded , " we were not able to completely cease the violence			2
" in an interview on " @entity28 , " @entity18 said the full cadre of observers -- 300 -- authorized by the @entity31 last month would be on site in the coming days			0
" they are patrolling every day , whenever possible , " he said			0
" they try their best to cease this violence			2
it requires strong political will at the level of president @entity39 , and also it requires full cooperation by the opposition forces			2
" the report by the @entity44 on @entity4 noted the growing power of forces opposed to president @entity39			1
" whereas government forces had previously been responding primarily to demonstrations , they now face armed and well - organized fighters -- bolstered by defectors who joined them			1
" " gross violations continue unabated , " the commission 's report said , adding regime forces commit most of the " serious human rights violations			2
" the documented abuses " reflect this shifting context " amid widespread fears that the popular uprising against the regime of @entity39 , spurred by a tough crackdown against peaceful protests , is spiraling toward all - out civil war			2
at least 40 civilians were killed across the country thursday , the opposition @entity69 said , among them " a complete family ... martyred in the shelling " of a neighborhood in @entity73			1
another opposition group , the @entity74 , reported 43 people killed			1
its toll includes 35 civilians mostly in the provinces of @entity79 , @entity73 and @entity80 , as well as eight government forces dead in clashes with defectors in @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
@entity2 officials say more than 9,000 people , mostly civilians , have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted since the uprising began in march 2011			1
opposition groups report a higher death toll in excess of 11,000 people			1
the commission said abuses have mounted since march , even though @entity39 's government and opposition forces say they have embraced @entity2 and @entity100 envoy @entity99 's six - point peace plan that includes a cease - fire			1
the military has conducted " large - scale " strikes on sites known for " hosting defectors and / or armed persons " escorting protests or supporting the @entity108 , the anti-government resistance force , the report said			1
people have died when security forces shelled " small opposition strongholds , " conducted house - to - house searches and placed snipers on rooftops			1
lethal force has been used against protesters in @entity80 , @entity79 , @entity119 , @entity73 , @entity84 , @entity120 and villages nationwide			0
" many such protests were accompanied by armed groups , which have described their role as providing protection for the demonstrators , " the report said			1
" the resulting clashes were deadly for demonstrators , members of these armed groups and security forces alike , yet too often citizens bore the brunt of the violence			1
" torture and arbitrary arrest remain a problem , the report 's authors said , citing the case of a man accused of trafficking for anti-government groups as an example			0
" they allegedly beat him severely and applied electric shocks to his legs , " the report said			0
children have been killed or injured in attacks on protests and by snipers ' gunfire , while government forces have targeted schools and used one as a command post			1
boys as young as age 10 detained by regime forces " repeatedly indicate that they are tortured to admit that older male members of their family are ' @entity108 ' soldiers or supporters , " the report said			0
" wounded children have been unable to seek treatment due to fears of being perceived as anti-government armed groups supporters or for fear of being beaten in health facilities			0
children have died due to a lack of health care during government blockades			0
some , including those injured as a result of torture , have been willfully denied medical care			0
" anti-government armed groups have executed security forces and suspected collaborators , the report said			1
one military defector cited the execution of three @entity187 snipers , and there have been reports of " makeshift prisons			0
" " one anti-government armed group fighter also admitted that he and his associates had killed government soldiers when the captives refused to join them , " the report said			1
the groups also have increased their use of homemade bombs known as improvised explosive devices			0
some people interviewed described bombs made of " nails inside pipes with explosive powder and a fuse , " and others made of gas and fertilizer			0
one fighter described planting mines that targeted army tanks			0
there have been reports of security forces or their supporters confessing under torture after their capture by resistance fighters			1
" two @entity187 , held in late january 2012 and released in late april 2012 , later made public statements about physical abuse suffered , including the breaking of bones , during their captivity , " the report said			0
there have been instances of fighters kidnapping security forces and civilians , purportedly for prisoner exchanges but also for use as ransoms to buy weapons			1
some anti-government groups have used children " as medical porters , messengers and cooks , for units in the field and delivery of medical supplies to field hospitals			0
" the report pointed to bombing attacks in @entity84 , @entity119 and @entity120 between march and may , including the suicide car bombings in @entity84 on may 10 that left 55 people dead			2
the commission said it ca n't " ascertain " who is responsible for the " criminal " acts			0
some experts and officials say neither security forces nor anti-government forces may be responsible , suggesting " third " forces -- such as jihadi groups -- may be to blame			0
@entity18 distanced himself from his earlier assertion that @entity258 " must be " behind the @entity84 bombings , saying thursday , " we do not have any clear evidence what @entity258 was behind			0
" nonetheless , " considering the scale and sophistication of the terrorist attacks , " the @entity2 leader said , " it seems to be clear that there are certain organizations and groups with ... clear political intent			2
" one senior @entity272 official told @entity0 that there are nearly 1,500 @entity258 members and sympathizers in @entity4			2
many have entered the country from @entity278 and @entity279 and have been part of a bombing and ambush campaign against @entity4 intelligence and military targets			2
@entity286 officials are concerned about jihadists in @entity4 and work with border countries to thwart them			2
but some @entity286 officials say the 1,500 number is too high			0
@entity18 said thursday the growing tension in @entity279 , where clashes erupted earlier this week after the killing of two anti-assad clerics , is very troubling			0
" we are entering into a pivotal moment , " @entity18 told @entity24			0
" we are very much worried about this kind of spillover effect			0
... we have to prevent this			0
" the report was issued as @entity4 's newly elected parliament convened to elect a speaker and swear in new members			1
the government said the elections were all - inclusive , but opposition forces call the process a sham			1
the opposition @entity309 is looking for a new leader after the resignation of its @entity313 - based president , @entity312			2
@entity4 's opposition has long been fractious , proving a disappointment to @entity317 and @entity318 nations who dislike the regime and want @entity39 out of power			1
@entity0 's @entity322 and @entity323 contributed to this report .			0
