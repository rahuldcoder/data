her death adds to a growing list of men and women who have been accused of sorcery and then tortured or killed in the @entity15 island nation , where traditional beliefs hold sway in many regions			1
the victims are often scapegoats for someone else 's unexplained death , and bands of tribesmen collude to mete out justice to them for their supposed magical powers , police said			1
" we have had difficulties in a number of previous incidents convincing people to come forward with information , " said @entity26 , assistant commissioner of police and commander of the @entity28 , where the killing occurred			2

" early tuesday , a group of people dragged the woman , believed to be in her late teens to early 20s , to a dumping ground outside the city of @entity48			1
they stripped her naked , bound her hands and legs , stuffed a cloth in her mouth , tied her to a log and set her on fire , @entity26 said			0
" when the people living nearby went to the dump site to investigate what caused the fire , they found a human being burning in the flames , " he said			0

@entity90 anthropology professor @entity89 , who lived in a village in the western province of @entity3 in the early 1980s , traced family histories for 42 years and found that one in three adult deaths were homicides -- " the bulk of these being collective killings of suspected sorcerers , " he wrote in his book , " from primitive to @entity98 in @entity99 and @entity100			1
