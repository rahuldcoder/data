@entity1 pythons have been threatening @entity3 's ecosystem for years , so the state is turning to the public for help in the form of a hunting contest to cull the population			1
the @entity10 on saturday launched the 2013 @entity11			1
" we are hoping to gauge from the python challenge the effectiveness of using an incentive - based model as a tool to address this problem , " says @entity13 spokeswoman @entity12			2
a grand prize of $ 1,500 will be awarded to the person who kills the most pythons , and $ 1,000 will go to the person who bags the longest one			2
according to the rules , road kill will not be eligible			0
participants paid a $ 25 registration fee and completed an online training course			1
the training focuses on safety while hunting pythons			1
" it 's very difficult to find these animals and we do n't really have a good strategy on how to contain this population , " said @entity34 , spokeswoman for @entity35			0
" this is a pilot to see if it will gain public interest in areas that you can hunt so that they would be able to remove and capture these snakes			0
" the @entity1 python is native to @entity49 and was first found in the @entity50 in 1979 , according to researchers at the @entity52			1
these snakes were determined to be an established species in 2000			0
it is believed that the snakes were originally pets that found their way into @entity35			0
the @entity50 , known as the river of grass , is a vast area with a climate perfect for the pythons to hide and thrive			0
and thrive they do : the largest @entity1 python ever found in @entity3 -- its 17 foot , 6 - inch carcass weighed 164.5 pounds -- was harvested in the @entity50 in august			1
researchers at the @entity52 found 87 eggs inside the snake			0
@entity68 told @entity69 last year that it is believed " tens of thousands " of @entity1 pythons live in the @entity50			1
the snakes prey on native wildlife such as the endangered @entity76 wood rat and the endangered wood stork			1
the largest prey , @entity68 told @entity69 , was a 76 - pound deer that was found in the stomach of a 16 - foot python a few months ago			0
earlier this year , researchers at @entity83 , @entity84 and the @entity85 reported that populations of rabbits and foxes have disappeared and numbers of raccoons , opossums and bobcats have dropped as much as 99 %			1
last january , the @entity93 instituted a ban on the importation of @entity1 pythons -- along with three other species of exotic snake -- and their eggs			1
the @entity11 has laid out four specific areas where the snakes can be harvested , and the park is off - limits to the general public			1
" the park is very restricted on what it can do as far as animal captures and removal , " @entity68 said			0
the python problem has spread to other wildlife management areas in the state besides the @entity50			2
" we 're supportive of the state exploring various measures in order to reduce the populations outside the park , " @entity68 said			2
in the end , she said , " it will also reduce the population of the snakes that get into the park			2
" according to the rules of the contest , reducing the population means killing the snakes			2
" we want to make sure this is done in a humane way , " @entity12 said			0
the competition 's website lists several ways to kill a python " in a humane manner that results in immediate loss of consciousness and destruction of the brain			0
" it suggests shooting the snake in the head with a firearm or decapitating it with a machete			0
wildlife officials say the 2013 @entity11 is not only about killing snakes			1
" one of things that is very important to us is to educate the public about the @entity1 python and how this species is impacting the state of @entity3 , " @entity12 said			1
" we 're hoping to inform people ... if they do have exotic pets that they understand the importance of not releasing them into the wild			0
" the contest ends at midnight on february 10 .			0

the state of @entity3 has launch the month - long 2013 @entity11
the goal is to cull the *exploding* population of @entity1 pythons , wildlife officials say
