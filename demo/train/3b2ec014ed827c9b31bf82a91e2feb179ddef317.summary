-- world no. 1 @entity1 lamented a " rough day " after equaling the second - worst score of his professional career on saturday			1
the @entity5 carded a seven - over - par 79 as he posted a triple bogey and two doubles in his opening nine holes at the @entity10 , to be 16 shots off the lead as he struggled in the windy conditions			1
" it was a rough day , " the defending champion told the @entity16 website			2
" it was tough out there from beginning to end			0
" woods had seemed in good shape to end his five - year wait for a 15th major title at this month 's @entity25 , with four wins already in 2013 , but his form at @entity28 in @entity29 has been his worst this season -- carding 71 and 74 in the opening round of a tournament he has won five times			1
" it 's just one of those things where i 'm sure i 'm not the only one who struggled out there , " said @entity1 , playing his first tournament since his public spat with @entity41 -- who was accused of a racist remark after saying he would serve @entity1 " fried chicken " in response to a question about their argument at last month 's @entity47 " the conditions were tough -- when i missed it cost me , " @entity1 added			1
" i caught the wrong gusts at the wrong time , made a couple bad swings and all in all it just went the wrong way			0
" starting on the back nine , @entity1 posted 44 by the turn -- his worst effort on the @entity16			1
he hit back with three birdies but then dropped two more shots , including a bogey at the last hole			2
" we did n't hit that many bad shots starting out the day and the next thing you know we are quite a few over par , " he said			2
" it was a tough day			0
i tried to fight back on the back nine , just did n't quite materialize			0
" @entity70 @entity69 also struggled in the third round , undoing his good work having earlier completed a weather - delayed 69 that meant he made the halfway cut			1
the @entity76 carded 75 -- three better than his opening 78 -- as he ended the day tied for 64th , two shots ahead of @entity20 but 14 behind leader @entity79			0
@entity79 posted his second successive round of 70 to claim a two - shot lead from fellow @entity5 @entity82 ( 68 ) and @entity83 ( 73 )			1
@entity79 is in form after finishing second at last week 's @entity86 , while he won the @entity87 - @entity88 in february			0
halfway leader @entity89 dropped to a tie for fourth with @entity92 and 2010 @entity94 winner @entity93 of @entity95 after slumping to 76			0
meanwhile , @entity96 stayed in contention for a second successive @entity99 title despite faltering at the @entity100 on saturday			0
the 20 - year - old @entity101 , who last week became the youngest winner of the tour 's flagship @entity104 , carded one - under 71 to be tied for third in @entity106 -- four shots behind leader @entity108 of @entity109 .			2
