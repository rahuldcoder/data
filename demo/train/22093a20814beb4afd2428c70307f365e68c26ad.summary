-- when the @entity2 revolt erupted last year , @entity2 's president fled power in weeks			1
when @entity6 took to the streets , longtime leader @entity5 was swiftly ousted as well			0
in @entity9 , it took about seven months for rebels to topple dictator @entity11			0
and in @entity12 , sustained anti-government protests eventually led to the departure from power of president @entity16			2
but @entity17 , the president of embattled @entity18 , is a survivor			1
he 's remained ensconced in power despite an 11 - month popular uprising , a bloody government crackdown against civilians , and world outrage at the tales and videos filtering out of @entity18			1
observers say he 's been able to stay in power with a combination of regime ruthlessness , diplomatic subterfuge , and internal sectarian dynamics			2
@entity31 , spokeswoman for the @entity32 , the @entity18 opposition group , said that when @entity17 came to power in 2000 , he inherited a @entity34 - style intelligence network erected by his father , @entity35 , who ruled from the early 1970s till his death in 2000			1
that spider web of agencies has served to control popular discontent , she said			0
" he has a network within a network within a network of intelligence services			0
" @entity44 has continued what she calls " the family tradition			0
" the repression has generated the widespread fear " embedded in day - to - day life " among the populace			2
" he did n't come up with this himself			0
this came from his father , " she said			0
" in @entity18 , there are dozens of mukhabarat - types of agencies that spy on one another , " she said , using an @entity57 term for intelligence agencies			1
" in families , one does n't know if one 's sibling is an informant			2
" @entity31 said @entity35 has able to strike a deal with business elites 30 years ago during popular tumult then			0
" that 's been an important factor " and " up until recently " @entity17 has had the support of the business community			1
she compares the current president to @entity77 's @entity76 and @entity79 's @entity78 and she likens regimes in @entity81 and @entity82 , where sons inherited power from their fathers , to @entity17 's @entity87 regime			1
" he 's got a whole group around him , many of whom are from the old guard and they keep the pressure going , " with " @entity34 - style tactics that other repressive regimes have used			1
" " they are raising the level the violence , " she said			0
she said @entity17 staked out his position " at a time when the world is sort of getting smaller and everybody is more aware of human rights and individual rights and governments are pushing people for more transparency			1
" he missed a " tremendous opportunity " to work for that kind of change in his own country , she said			0
@entity111 , a @entity18 expert at the @entity112 , said he thinks @entity17 has been more brutal than @entity5 and @entity114 leader @entity113			1
" he 's been willing to use live fire extensively , " he said			2
" he 's just ruthless			2
" and in a reference to world and regional powers , @entity111 said " very simply we have not been ruthless with him			2
" there has long been sectarian strife in the @entity122 , particularly in @entity18 , where there are @entity124 as well as @entity127 - @entity126 animosities , among others			1
@entity18 's diverse sectarian dynamics buttress @entity17 , @entity111 said			1
@entity44 is part of an @entity132 minority in @entity18 , a largely @entity124 nation			2
that minority -- which he calls a heterodox offshoot of @entity136 -- prevails in the government and military			0
it and other @entity124 offshoots , such as @entity141 and @entity142 , have made up the core of the regime			0
@entity126 represent another minority that has not largely been anti-regime and even some @entity147 have made their peace with the government			0
during the 11 - month crisis , there has been a lot of international engagement with the regime			2
but @entity111 said @entity17 has done " a very good job of confusing diplomats			2
" " that 's his @entity157 , " he said			0
" he consistently lies and confounds people			0
" but world opinion appears to be shifting , even those previously supportive of the regime			0
" you can see statements by the @entity164 " indicating @entity17 is neither a friend nor an ally			2
" everyone is frustrated with him , " @entity111 said			0
still , @entity164 and @entity167 vetoed saturday 's @entity169 resolution that would have backed an @entity171 plan for @entity18 's president to step aside			1
@entity173 , director of the @entity174 , said @entity17 has been able to maintain some popular support with his rhetoric and has not been shy about using force over the years , even against people who were encouraged to open up and air their thoughts			1
" he 's convinced everyone he 's been a reformer , " he said			2
he is widely unpopular now in the @entity171 world , but many in the region have liked his stance against @entity186			0
" he 's presented himself as one of the sort of key leaders of the axis of resistance , " a reference to @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity18			1
@entity44 has modernized the government apparatus -- the omnipresent @entity87 rule and its " deep state			0
" he and the regime have had a " certain strength " from different sectors of society , such as the business community			0
there are @entity147 who support his regime and @entity17 's wife , @entity206 , comes from a @entity124 background			1
" all of these things have helped the regime internally , " he said			0
" it 's a mistake to just call it an @entity132 regime			2
" @entity212 , visiting fellow , @entity213 chair in strategy , at the @entity215 , said @entity17 's support is dwindling , but he 's been able to buy time for a number of reasons			1
first , the uprising did n't break out in the two top wealthy urban centers -- the capital , @entity223 , and the city of @entity225			0
while the unrest is closing in on those communities now , the opposition has been driven in the rural periphery of the country , far from the seats of political and economic power			0
there was no @entity18 " @entity234 , " the place in @entity236 where protesters gathered and that symbolized and catalyzed the @entity6 uprising			2
" @entity17 has and still continues to benefit from the fact that a mainly rural uprising has to make its way into the urban strongholds of the regime			1
the uprising has had a hard time taking root in major city centers that fear a deeper destabilization of an already weakened @entity18 economy , " @entity212 said			1
in addition , @entity17 's supporters are fearful of recrimination in a @entity255 era , and that gives them pause about backing the opposition , which appears to some as splintered and disorganized			1
" the local opposition forces remain deeply divided and have yet to show true unity of purpose , command and control , and a socio - economic platform that the average @entity18 can look to as a viable and stable alternative to the ruling @entity17 regime			1
this has become all the more challenging as the opposition has moved to arm itself in a bid to fight back against security apparatus ' brutal crackdown , " he said			0
" the @entity273 in particular has had to work hard against perceptions that many of its members and leadership have been parachuted into their roles as an opposition force			0
" communities at the margins of @entity18 society , like @entity126 , @entity284 and @entity142 may be unhappy , but prefer to stick with the devil they know -- @entity17 -- than risk the unknown of a post @entity17 era			1
" taken together , we have a broad pattern here			0
most if not all of these groups are unhappy with how the @entity17 regime has managed @entity18 's nearly year - long unrest , " he said			1
but " these groups prefer that @entity17 remain in power rather bet on opposition forces that remain largely leaderless , divided and appear to be increasingly radicalized			1
" there is also a fear that change will bring instability			0
" many @entity18 remain fearful of a @entity9 - style decay into militia warfare and lawlessness and are wary of the costs of uncertain transitions in @entity6 , @entity12 and @entity308			1
outside of @entity18 , the opposition faces yet another challenge , " he said			1
and , he said , the international community and the opposition " seem to have fundamentally misjudged the resilience of the @entity18 military			1
" divisions in the @entity171 and at the @entity316 have also helped @entity17 buy time , @entity212 said			1
" this division at the international level is tantamount to the kind of great power politics , balancing and bandwagoning that were the hallmark of the @entity325			0
this has and continues to buy valuable time and international legitimacy for the @entity17 regime , " he said			1
still , @entity31 said she thinks time is short @entity17 -- that the man does n't have the same gravitas and proficiency of his father , who commanded the country till his death			1
" @entity17 does not have the skills and intelligence , " she said			2
" his father was extremely brutal but intelligent			0
this guy 's an idiot			0

@entity18 's @entity17 's benefited from " @entity34 - style tactics , " an activist says
the president has portrayed himself as a reformer but is ruthless , *scholars* say
ethnic *rivalries* figure into support for the regime
a divided opposition is helping the president buy time
