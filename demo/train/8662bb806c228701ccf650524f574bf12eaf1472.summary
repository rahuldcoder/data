@entity0 -- royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child that will be heir to the @entity7 throne			1
here 's what you need to know and the latest developments : could the world 's media be camped outside the wrong hospital ? @entity7 's @entity15 newspaper reports that a contingency plan is in place for @entity18 to give birth at the @entity20 in @entity21 , if she goes into labor while staying at her parents ' home in @entity25 , and its swift progress means the journey back to @entity0 is impractical			1
@entity28 of @entity29 is expected , however , to give birth at the private @entity31 wing of @entity32 , next to @entity33 in @entity0			1
it 's where @entity35 was born			2
@entity18 's mother , @entity37 , is likely to be on hand at the hospital			1
why are some babies overdue ? there 's been plenty of speculation about the baby 's name -- and betting is going strong			1
the famous @entity46 in @entity0 , which takes in and re-homes lost and unwanted pets , has gone a step further and named a litter of kittens after the bookies ' favorites : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
@entity55 is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world			1
on a visit to northern @entity64 wednesday , she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great - grandchild to be a boy or a girl			2
the queen replied : " i do n't think i mind			2
i would very much like it to arrive			0
i 'm going on holiday			0
" @entity28 of @entity29 is now overdue			0
a royal source tells @entity1 that her due date was july 13			1
she and prince @entity35 announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in july , but did not announce the date			0
prince @entity77 ' wife @entity76 , said monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby 's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon			1
" we 're all waiting at the end of a telephone , " she said , in an exchange filmed by @entity83			0
" i hope by the end of the week , he or she will be there			0
" the baby will have the title @entity98 prince or @entity95 ( the baby 's name ) of @entity29 , @entity93 said this month			1
however , it could be as long as 10 days before the baby 's name is announced			1
anyone born in @entity7 on the same day as @entity35 and @entity18 's baby will receive a special coin from the @entity105 : a silver penny , dated 2013 , that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl			1
the first indication that the royal baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor , royal sources tell @entity1			2
the next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth			0
it will be made in the form of a formal bulletin , signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to @entity129			0
there , the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce @entity35 's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see			2
the first to know about the royal baby will be @entity55 , prime minister @entity137 and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations , along with the rest of the royal and @entity37 families			1
if the baby arrives in the middle of the night , it 's unlikely the queen will be awoken , so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning			2
celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the @entity153 in @entity154 ( 41 rounds ) and the @entity156 at the @entity157 ( 62 rounds ) after the baby is born			0
@entity35 and @entity18 did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand , royal sources say			1
there has been speculation it is a girl , however , especially after a member of the public said in march that the duchess almost uttered " daughter " while at a public event in @entity170			0
the woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied , " thank you , i will take that for my d -- " but then stopped herself			0
the baby will be third in line to the throne after @entity77 and prince @entity35 , regardless of gender			0
a rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture , which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons			0
it means that if the next royal baby is a girl , she will eventually become queen ; previously , a younger male sibling would have taken precedence			1
the queen 's cousin , @entity196 , told @entity1 's @entity198 she hoped the child would have a normal childhood			2
" i imagine and hope that its early life , until it 's at least in its teens , will be just a jolly , happy , ordinary child 's life , " she said			0
it 's not known where the @entity206 and @entity207 plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth			1
@entity35 is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the @entity212 , royal sources say			0
he will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot			0
the revelation that @entity18 was pregnant came after she was admitted to a @entity0 hospital in december for acute morning sickness .			2

a contingency plan is in place for @entity18 to give birth near her parents ' home , media report
a royal source says @entity18 , the @entity207 , is overdue
the queen does n't mind if the baby 's a boy or a girl -- she just wants it to arrive soon
