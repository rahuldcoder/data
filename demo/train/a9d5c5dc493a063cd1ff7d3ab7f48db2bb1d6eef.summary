-- the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons in the hands of @entity4 of the types that were used in the @entity7 massacre is sometimes framed as a public health issue in the @entity4			1
there is considerable merit to the notion of treating gun violence as a public health matter			1
after all , homicides -- around 70 % of which are accomplished with firearms in the @entity4 according to an authoritative study by the @entity18 -- are the 15th leading cause of death for @entity4			1
but framing gun control as a public health issue does n't quite do justice to the problem			1
it 's probably more or less inevitable that most @entity4 will die of cancer or a heart attack , but why is it even plausible that so many @entity4 in elementary schools , colleges , movie theaters and places of worship should die at the hands of young men armed with semiautomatic weapons ? @entity4 generally regard themselves as belonging to an exceptional nation			2
and in terms of living in a religiously tolerant and enormously diverse country , @entity4 can certainly take some justified pride			2
will @entity7 change @entity4 's attitude toward guns ? that tolerant pluralism was on display sunday night at the interfaith memorial service for the 27 victims in @entity7 , which featured priests from several christian denominations , clerics of the @entity51 and @entity52 faiths as well as a rabbi , a memorial that was led by the country 's first @entity56 president			2
but there is another side to @entity56 exceptionalism that many @entity4 seem strangely unable to recognize : @entity4 kill each other with guns at rates that are unheard of in other advanced industrialized countries			2
@entity65 , with around a fifth of the population of the @entity4 , had 41 gun murders in 2010 while the @entity4 had around 10,000			1
the scale of this death toll really resembles a national security problem as much it does a public health issue			1
consider that jihadist terrorists have only been able to kill 17 @entity4 in the @entity4 since 9/11			2
meanwhile , some 88,000 @entity4 died in gun violence from 2003 and 2010 , according to the @entity18 study			1
that means that in the past decade , an @entity56 residing in the @entity4 was around 5,000 times more likely to be killed by a fellow citizen armed with a gun than by a terrorist inspired by @entity81			1
consider also that there are cities in the @entity4 today that exact a higher death toll from violence than the civilian death toll in the war in @entity88			1
last year , some 3,000 @entity88 civilians died in the @entity90 out of a population of 30 million , which makes the civilian death rate from the @entity88 war 1 in 10,000			1
yet residents of @entity95 are being killed at a rate that is six times that of @entity88 civilians killed in that war			1
@entity95 had 199 murders last year , or 6 for every 10,000 residents			0
@entity101 , where i write this from , had 108 murders last year or 2 for every 10,000 residents , making it twice as deadly as the @entity90 is for civilians			0
the numbers of @entity4 dying in homicidal gun violence would be even worse if it were n't for the fact that some of the techniques the @entity4 military has learned on the battlefields of @entity115 and @entity88 have been imported into @entity56 hospitals			1
so while the number of people seriously injured in gun - related violent incidents has actually gone up almost 50 percent in the past decade , you are more likely to survive a gun shot today than would have been the case even a few years ago , as the @entity123 recently reported			0
analysis : guns and the law the number of deaths caused by semiautomatic pistols and assault rifles are not broken out in tabulations of the total deaths caused by guns in the @entity4 , but a recent study by the magazine @entity135 found that in the 62 mass shootings in the @entity4 carried out during the past three decades the vast majority were carried out with semiautomatic pistols or assault rifles , most of which had been obtained legally			2
legislation to control the spread of deadly semiautomatic weapons will not , of course , eliminate such violence			0
critics of efforts to tighten gun laws can point to @entity150 , which has very tough gun control laws , and yet @entity152 was able to acquire semiautomatic weapons and kill dozens of people in and around @entity155 last year			0
but @entity152 was , in fact , an exceptional case and the murder rate in @entity150 is still eight times lower than in the @entity4 the @entity159 is , of course , very much part of the @entity56 fabric			0
but the intent of the founders was that the amendment protected the rights of citizens to bear arms in a militia for their collective self - defense			0
today , we are not likely to need to organize local militias for our defense now we have something called the @entity174			0
semiautomatic handguns and semiautomatic assault rifles that fire many rounds in a minute were not envisaged by the founders nor do they do much more to enhance self - defense than an ordinary pistol or rifle			0
such semiautomatic weapons also are not much use for hunting deer and the like			0
but they are very good for killing lots of @entity4 quickly			0
do you own a gun that fell under the now - expired federal weapons ban ? if the murder of 20 small children in @entity7 is not an opportunity for the country to challenge the theological position of the gun lobby that the @entity159 allows pretty much any @entity56 to possess military - style weaponry , when will that day ever come ?			0

@entity198 : gun violence is sometimes called a public health issue in the @entity4
he says it also amounts to a national security issue , taking much *larger* toll than terrorism
civilians are more likely to get killed in some @entity4 cities than @entity88 civilians are , he says
