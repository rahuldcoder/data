@entity4 's @entity1 and @entity3 's @entity2 gaming networks experienced widespread problems on christmas day as a hacker group claimed responsibility for what it said was an attack			1
hundreds of users took to @entity12 to report problems with the systems , which lasted much of the day			1
" with the # xbox hacking shutdown going on i 'm watching my 15 year old nephew meltdown : ' i 've got nothing else to do ! ! ! ! ' " @entity15 wrote on the social messaging site			2
the problem persisted for hours , but thursday night @entity2 briefly posted a message on its support website saying : " were you having a hard time signing in to @entity2 ? if so , we 're glad to say we 've reached a solution ! you can once again sign in without any issues			1
thanks for hanging in there while we worked			0
we appreciate it ! " but many @entity1 users were still having difficulty logging on to their network			1
gamers were able to play games offline , but could n't communicate with other players or make use of network functions			1
the hacker group @entity39 said earlier it was " smacking " the two systems , apparently one of several attacks in december			1
the group took responsibility for keeping each network down earlier this month on separate occasions			1
on thursday , the group asked for retweets in exchange for ending the problem , which could be a distributed denial of service attack			2
that 's when hackers flood networks with illegitimate traffic , overwhelming the ability of the servers			0
the problem might be exacerbated by video gamers who received new systems for @entity60 and were adding to the potential traffic on one of the busiest gaming days of the year			0
the network downtime started just hours after @entity3 's @entity2 video store started to stream the @entity67 comedy " @entity68			1
" the movie was made by @entity70 , a sibling of @entity4 's @entity1 division			2
@entity4 was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late november that was widely believed to be motivated , at least in part , by @entity77 's anger over " @entity68 , " which depicts the assassination of @entity79			0
but there was no indication that thursday 's problems were in any way connected to the movie 's digital release			0
other participating distributors of the movie , such as @entity88 , were unaffected			0
and @entity1 is not participating in the release			0
a @entity70 spokesman deferred to @entity1 for comment about the outage			2
@entity5 's @entity93 contributed to this report .			0

some @entity2 users finally able to log on to network
*incident* and a hack of @entity70 do n't appear to be related
