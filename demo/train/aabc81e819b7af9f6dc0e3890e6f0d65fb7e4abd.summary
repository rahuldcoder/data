-- @entity2 's @entity1 produced one of the biggest shocks in @entity6 final history , beating @entity7 in straight sets at @entity9 to secure her first @entity11 success			1
@entity7 , bidding for her fourth @entity6 crown , had gone into the match as a hot favorite despite a troubled year blighted by injury and serious illness			1
but @entity1 never allowed the @entity18 , who was cheered on by a patriotic @entity21 crowd on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , to settle -- claiming a spectacular 6 - 2 6 - 3 triumph in 73 minutes , as @entity7 lost her cool following a contentious umpiring decision			1
" i had one of my best days and i 'm very fortunate that i had it on this stage in @entity21 , " @entity1 said after the match			1
" ever since i started playing , it was a dream of mine to be here one day , and now my dream has come true			0
" @entity1 breaks @entity2 drought @entity1 , whose run to the final included a marathon third - round victory over @entity37 that lasted a tournament record three hours and 16 minutes , continued : " @entity7 , you are a fantastic player , great champion and have done wonders for our sport			1
" thanks to everyone back home for supporting me			0
all my friends , family and everyone else , thanks so much for supporting me			0
i look forward to coming back home			0
" although she was only seeded 28th , @entity7 came into the tournament bang in form after winning two warm - up events -- including victory over @entity1 in the final of the @entity55 in @entity56			1
and the @entity18 was mightily impressive in dismantling world number one @entity57 in the semifinals , while ninth seed @entity1 struggled to beat unseeded @entity62 @entity61 in three sets in the other semi			2
with emotions high among @entity21 , on a poignant day for the city , a @entity7 win looked set to provide the @entity18 with a fitting end to a difficult occasion			2
but @entity1 , whose only previous @entity11 final appearance came last year when she lost the @entity71 to @entity72 , did not read the script , dominating the opening set against the 13 - time @entity11 champion , who had reached this stage without dropping a set in the tournament			1
@entity1 broke @entity7 to lead 2 - 1 and then won the last 12 point of the set in an impressive display of pace and power			1
then came the talking point of the match			0
@entity7 had already saved one break point in the first game of the second set			2
however , on the second break point , the @entity18 shouted " come on " as she unleashed a fierce forehand before @entity1 had reached the ball			2
umpire @entity91 immediately penalized @entity7 for " intentional hindrance , " and the point and the game went to @entity1			1
@entity7 reacted angrily to the decision and was then given a code violation for verbal abuse			2
the @entity18 immediately broke back and then held serve but continued to berate the umpire at the changeover , as her composure ebbed away			0
" do n't even look at me -- if i see you in the corridor do n't even walk past me , " shouted the 29 - year - old			0
" a code violation for expressing my opinion ? , we 're in @entity18 -- you 're unattractive inside " @entity1 then broke serve to take a 4 - 3 lead and broke @entity7 again to clinch a famous victory -- becoming the first @entity2 women 's winner at @entity9 since @entity109 in 1973			1
when asked about the incident after the match , @entity7 said : " i was just doing my best			0
i hit a winner but i guess it did n't count			0
it would n't have mattered anyway because @entity115 played really well and she is a great player			0
" she continued : " six months ago i did n't think i would be standing here			0
i did n't think i would even be standing , let alone be here			0
" @entity1 's victory means she joins @entity118 and @entity119 as first time @entity11 winners this year .			1

@entity1 is the new @entity6 champion after beating @entity7
the @entity2 proves too strong for favorite @entity7 , winning 6 - 2 6 - 3 in 73 minutes
@entity7 loses her cool after being penalized for " intentional hindrance "
it is @entity1 's first @entity11 success in her second major tournament final
