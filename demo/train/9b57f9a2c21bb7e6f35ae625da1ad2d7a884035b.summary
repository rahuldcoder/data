-- it seems difficult to open a paper , turn on tv or visit a website these days without hearing some awful new " discovery " about @entity8 and how it 's going to end the world			1
more often than not , these claims are overblown , designed to get attention and score political points			0
this week , the @entity12 published an article explaining that the savings many people hope to see in lower - cost insurance could come at the cost of fewer choices with respect to health care providers			1
if we want to be realistic about health care reform , we have to acknowledge that everything comes with a tradeoff			1
in order to make insurance cost less , private insurance companies have to make use of the tools available to them			1
in the past , they could have tried preferentially to cover healthier people and refuse coverage to those with chronic conditions			0
that leaves a cheaper risk pool , which results in lower premiums			2
but @entity8 no longer allows that			1
if we want guaranteed issue and community ratings ( so that no one can be denied insurance and no one can be charged more for being sick ) , then insurance companies must use other strategies to save money			1
in the past , insurance companies could have tried to issue policies that did n't cover as much			1
policies with skimpier benefits are cheaper , too			0
but @entity8 sets minimums with respect to what qualifies as comprehensive coverage			1
so that tool was taken away as well			0
in the past , insurance companies could have set lower annual or lifetime limits , which confines their risk and allows them to sell insurance at a lower price			1
or , they could have set really high deductibles or out - of - pocket maximums			2
these , too , are now more tightly regulated			0
so what 's left ? how can insurance companies make health care cheaper so that they can deliver lower premiums to people and attract more business ? well , one thing they could do is limit their administrative costs			1
but if you ask insurance companies , they tell you that they are already running pretty lean			1
they also like to make a nice profit , and they like to pay their executives well			0
so they are left with one really good option : pay less for care			1
how do they do this ? one way they 've been doing it for years is to contract with certain doctors and hospitals to provide care for their beneficiaries for less money			1
providers will agree to this because it guarantees them a certain amount of business			2
insurance companies like it because it means they can pay less , charge lower premiums and sell more policies			1
and that is how many plans in the health care exchanges will compete for your business			1
please understand that this is nothing new with respect to health insurance			1
at my job , there are a number of different plans offered to employees			0
the most expensive plan allows us to see the widest range of physicians			0
there 's a cheaper plan available , but my kids ' pediatrician ( whom we revere ) is n't in that network			2
so we pay for the more expensive plan			0
that 's a choice we make as informed consumers			2
problems will arise if people do n't understand what they are getting into			0
there 's no such thing as a free lunch			2
if you buy the cheapest plan , it may not include the doctor you want			0
if choice is your no. 1 goal , then you will probably have to pay for it			0
what makes this a problem for @entity8 , though , is that some health exchanges are n't offering a choice			1
for instance , in @entity148 , only one insurance company is offering exchange plans , and it has a rather limited network			2
if you were previously uninsured , then the most straightforward argument is that the plan you 're getting , probably with subsidies to make it cheaper , is better than nothing			0
but some people , who might have had individually issued policies before @entity8 with larger networks , will not be happy with their new plans			1
they may be cheaper , but they may have preferred to pay more for choice , and now they wo n't be able to			0
on the whole , i believe far more people will benefit from @entity8 than will be hurt by it			2
any change will inevitably make someone unhappy			0
this is one of those situations			0
we should n't ignore this deficiency			0
one way might be to have a public option , run by the government , which might have a larger network			1
@entity178 has perhaps the largest national network in the country , as more doctors accept it than just about any other form of insurance			2
so it 's totally possible to offer more choice			0
but that will require politicians to work together to amend the law to make it better			0
it will be instructive to watch how people react to news like this			0
if they are truly concerned about fixing this problem , then they will seek solutions to do so			0
if they use this issue only to demagogue against the entire law , though , it 's likely that they care more about politics than policy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

lower - cost insurance could come at the cost of fewer choices of health care providers
@entity207 : insurance companies have been doing this for years to keep costs down
he says just as there 's no policy that is perfect , there are tradeoffs to @entity8
@entity207 : one way to fix this is to have a public option , which might have a larger network
