-- @entity1 and her mom are friends on @entity4 , but that does n't mean they share everything			1
the 17 - year - old from @entity8 , @entity9 , has refined her @entity4 privacy settings so that her mother ca n't see all the posts that fill her timeline			1
her father , meanwhile , never checks the social network			2
" right now , my mom can only see things that i post			0
she ca n't see anything i 'm tagged in or anything that my friends say to me on my profile , " said @entity1 , a high school senior who asked to be identified only by her first name			2
" she does n't know that , though			0
i 'm like , 80 % sure that every other teenager has done that too			2
" with teen - agers and their parents ( grandparents , even ) increasingly active on social networks , both generations are joined in a delicate dance over privacy , safety and freedom of expression online			1
interviews with a handful of teens and adults suggest that some teens seek out corners of social media where they can communicate with their friends and peers away from the watchful eye , or embarrassing comments , of their parents			1
parents , meanwhile , are grappling with how to monitor their kids ' online activity and keep them safe without being stifling or intrusive			1
and both are seeking ways to coexist peacefully on the few social networks they do share			2
reputation is everything today 's teenagers are social media natives			1
they 've grown up putting their personal information online and are comfortable sharing photos and videos of themselves , updating relationship statuses and checking into locations			2
what they do n't share their parents ' level of concern about privacy and worries about companies or the government abusing their data			0
according to a recent study by the @entity73 , only 9 % of teens reported being " very concerned " about third parties accessing their data			1
that does n't mean they 're reckless with their personal information , according to @entity73 research			0
most teens exert careful control over what information is seen by whom , but more because they are acutely aware of how each nugget of posted information , even the number of likes it can get , shapes how they are perceived by peers			0
@entity73 found that teens have developed a variety of ways to control their privacy			0
they are comfortable navigating @entity4 's notoriously complicated privacy settings , and only 14 % have public - facing @entity4 profiles			1
they also edit what appears on their profile , deleting posts , comments and unwanted tags			0
for teens looking to hide social - media activity from adults , elaborate privacy settings can sometimes be unnecessary			1
fifty - eight percent of teens said they posted updates that were inside jokes or coded messages that only certain friends would understand			1
seeking out new online homes many teens are learning how to compartmentalize the different parts of their lives online			1
@entity4 is the most popular site for both teens and parents , according to @entity73 , but teens reported " waning enthusiasm " in the site in @entity73 focus groups			1
they cited the colonization of the site by adults and excessive amounts of " drama			1
" some teens use @entity4 for public posts but message each other on lesser - known social platforms that their parents are n't aware of or have n't signed up for			1
many teens are also on @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 -- sites where they report feeling less social pressure and more freedom to express themselves			1
@entity132 has seen rapid growth among young users , while @entity135 , with its looping six - second videos , is a creative form of messaging for a visually oriented generation			0
even straight - laced @entity147 is courting teenagers			0
earlier this month the social media site for professionals lowered its minimum age to 14 from 18 and announced special new pages for universities , hoping to edge into the college - selection process			1
if teenagers really do n't want something to be seen , they 'll retreat to more private messaging tools such as @entity158 , @entity159 or @entity160 , which can be used to send private messages to groups of friends			0
@entity160 is a mobile app which lets users share photos or videos that disappear after a few seconds			0
for that reason , it 's gained a reputation for promoting the exchange of @entity172 © images			0
" on snapchat ... anything goes ! " said @entity1 , the @entity173 teen			0
" @entity160 gets a little crazier because it 's supposed to be ' erased ' after 10 seconds or less			0
not sure if that 's actually true , but there 's definitely a different sense of security with @entity160 than @entity4 or @entity133			2
" making peace with parents some kids and parents say they have worked out ways to share social networks harmoniously			1
according to the recent @entity73 study , only 5 % of teens reported setting up filters for their parents , and the majority ( 70 % ) are friends with their parents on @entity4			1
@entity192 and her 16 - year - old daughter are both mainly on @entity4 , but the two have agreed on some boundaries			2
" her ground rule for me is to not comment on her friends ' comments unless they are directed to me , and not to tag her in photos without her consent , " said @entity192 , who lives in @entity196 , @entity197			0
@entity192 also stays off of her daughter 's other social networks , including @entity134 , @entity132 and @entity205			0
in exchange , her daughter is heeding her warnings against sharing personal information online and has promised not to post any photos she would n't be comfortable showing her parents			2
along the same lines , @entity1 's mom will tag her daughter in photos and like her posts , but she does n't comment much because she knows it 's embarrassing to her daughter			0
@entity1 , for her part , tries to keep it clean			0
" i really try to not have any pictures of me from any parties or any captions / comments with swear words ... but it 's hard to be 100 % clean when your entire life is online , " she said .			2
