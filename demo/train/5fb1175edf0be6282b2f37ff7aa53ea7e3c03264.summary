-- more than 115,000 volunteers have joined the crowdsourcing search for the missing @entity5 plane by going to their computers and reviewing satellite photos of the open ocean to find signs of the aircraft , a sponsor said wednesday			1
in all , these humanitarian - minded volunteers have posted 100 million page views in the first 34 hours since the crowdsourcing campaign began this week			1
the public was viewing 2 million pages of satellite imagery every 10 minutes on wednesday , said a senior director of a @entity18 , @entity19 , the firm that is leading the @entity22 effort			1
the volunteers are assisting the experts now in @entity25 and its surrounding ocean by looking for any sign of the commercial airliner			0
but as of wednesday , the amateurs online had n't had any luck			2
" up until now , there has n't been the smoking gun , the final clue , that leads to the location of the wreckage of the missing aircraft , " said @entity31 , founder of @entity33 's tomnod.com , where the online searches are being conducted			1
it was n't immediately clear whether authorities in @entity25 were aware of the crowdsourcing effort or chasing any leads identified by volunteers			1
however , search experts were examining wednesday the findings of a @entity48 satellite that " observed a suspected crash area at sea , " a @entity48 government agency said			2
the @entity48 imagery marked a potential big break in the frustrating search for the @entity57			0
the disappearance of @entity59 has become such an international mystery that @entity22 do - gooders have mobilized a " crowdsourcing campaign " poring over @entity33 's satellite photos -- all in the effort to find any trace of a plane floating in the @entity65			1
the task , however , is like the cliched search for a needle in a haystack			0
" we have found a lot of really interesting pieces of debris , lots of ships , " which are involved in the search , @entity31 told @entity0 on wednesday			0
" we can see from space all the boats and the infrastructure that 's in place " for the open sea hunt , said @entity31 , also a senior director for geospatial big data for @entity33 , which acquired tomnod.com last year			0
so many people are tantalized by the mystery and want to help in the search -- online , at least -- that they have crashed the website several times in the past couple of days			1
" yes , yesterday we had a quite a bit of trouble keeping up with the volume , " @entity31 said			0
" the response has been extraordinary			0
" in fact , scores of volunteers have posted their findings from tomnod.com on their @entity100 pages , which is @entity0 's own version of crowdsourcing , sometimes used in the news outlet 's coverage of world events			1
one @entity107 , @entity108 , early in the crowdsourcing campaign spotted an image in one satellite photograph that appears to be a commercial airliner floating in the ocean -- though @entity113 concedes the silhouette also resembles a boat			2
his discovery , however , has apparently turned out to be a false alarm -- especially in the wake of @entity120 's declaration wednesday that none of the online tips has yet yielded a major clue			2
@entity108 's flagging of the interesting image , however , went viral , and in the span of a couple of days , his @entity100 page is now ranked the eighth most popular of all - time , between a @entity129 posting and a @entity131 photo			0
interactive : what happened to @entity59 ?			0

" there has n't been the smoking gun *...* that leads to the location " of plane , exec says
