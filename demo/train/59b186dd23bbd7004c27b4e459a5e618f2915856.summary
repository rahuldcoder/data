airstrikes by the @entity3 - led coalition against @entity4 targeted the @entity6 rebel group @entity5 for the first time overnight in @entity8 , a monitoring group said thursday			1
one airstrike hit the headquarters for @entity5 in @entity11 , @entity12 province , near the @entity14 border crossing with @entity15 , the @entity17 - based @entity16 said			1
activist video and photos from the scene claimed to show a large explosion and a building blown into rubble			0
@entity5 is a @entity24 group that is not on the @entity3 list of designated terrorist organizations and so far has not been hit by coalition airstrikes			1
one of the more conservative @entity24 militant groups in the rebel alliance , @entity5 has members that sometimes fight alongside the @entity32 - affiliated @entity6 militant group @entity31 , but against @entity4			1
they are not linked to @entity32 , have not pledged allegiance to @entity32 , and are not named as a terror group by the @entity3			1
there are mixed opinions on how radical the group is , mostly because its entire leadership was killed in a september blast and the new leadership 's intentions are not yet clear , although some observers anticipate a more radical direction			0
this may have prompted concern in some quarters that it could become more closely allied to @entity31 , also known as @entity31 , which has been gaining ground in @entity8			2
however , @entity5 members are also seen by many @entity8 as moderates who protect them -- and these strikes , if they did hit @entity52 , risk again confirming the idea that the @entity3 is seeking to benefit the regime of @entity8 president @entity55			1
report : children hit in strike the @entity3 - led coalition carried out other airstrikes overnight wednesday to thursday , including one apparently targeting a vehicle belonging to @entity31 in @entity62 , a town also in @entity12 province on the border with @entity15			1
video posted by activists purported to show a car in flames on the street in @entity62 while people watched it burn			0
the coalition also struck the headquarters of @entity31 in the city of @entity76 , the @entity16 said , with initial reports indicating that two children were killed and other people were injured			2
photos posted by activists claimed to show the bodies of two young children covered in dust with severe injuries , along with other men being treated by doctors in a clinic			0
@entity89 has not independently verified the images			0
like @entity4 , @entity31 is trying to establish an @entity92 state , though primarily in @entity8			2
it has emerged as one of the most effective groups fighting the @entity8 regime , drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in @entity98 and elsewhere			2
at least six militants from @entity31 were also killed in a @entity3 - led coalition airstrike in the western part of @entity104 , the @entity16 said thursday , citing reliable sources in the embattled city in northwestern @entity8			1
the airstrike also caused massive damage to the group 's local headquarters in an area known as @entity110 , in the western @entity104 countryside , according to the monitoring group			1
@entity3 official : @entity115 bomb - maker targeted a senior @entity3 military official told @entity89 thursday that all strikes around @entity12 on wednesday night targeted the @entity118			1
there were no strikes targeting @entity31 or any other group , he said			0
according to a @entity3 defense official who has access to the latest information about the strikes , a key @entity123 jihadist belonging to the @entity118 was killed in one of them			1
the @entity3 fired at a vehicle it believes was carrying @entity130 , a skilled @entity115 bomb - maker who also has ties to core @entity32 members in @entity135			1
@entity3 intelligence agencies believe @entity137 has facilitated the movement of @entity140 jihadists to @entity8 and back to @entity140 , raising worries they could then travel to the @entity3			2
@entity137 traveled to @entity8 in the last two years from @entity135 , where he worked with @entity32			0
there were a total of five strikes against @entity115 targets near @entity12 , the official said , using both drones and fighter aircraft			0
the official could not say which type of aircraft struck @entity137 's vehicle			0
the @entity3 has been searching for top @entity115 leaders since it determined initial strikes against the group in september failed to kill its main leadership			0
in the wake of the strikes against the @entity118 in september , @entity157 spoke of " action to disrupt the imminent attack plotting against the @entity3 and @entity163 interests			2
" the group was formed by senior @entity32 members based in @entity135 who traveled to @entity8 to direct operations , @entity89 national security analyst @entity164 reported , citing @entity169 and @entity3 officials			1
" @entity115 " is an ancient term for an @entity92 empire			0
@entity173 administration could expand @entity8 mission analyst : targeting @entity52 could backfire if @entity5 has been targeted -- rather than another target being sought that happened to be in @entity52 's headquarters , or the strike being a targeting blunder -- it could be a complex matter for @entity3 policy , while also raising the specter of so - called mission creep			1
" if @entity52 has indeed been targeted , it may well have deeply damaging consequences in terms of @entity8 ' perception of @entity3 objectives in their country , " said @entity185 , a visiting fellow at the @entity186 and a leading expert on @entity4 and @entity8			2
" for many opposition @entity8 , targeting @entity4 makes sense , targeting @entity196 is unpopular , but targeting a group like @entity52 , despite their conservative base , would undoubtedly backfire			0
" unfortunately , it would seem that the @entity3 - led coalition is still in reaction mode -- each mistake will force more reaction , but all the time , our objectives are getting further and further from us			0
" according to @entity185 , @entity52 has been going through a significant process of top - down moderation over the past nine months , with considerable consequences for the group 's willingness to compromise on political objectives			0
" if it 's been done , adding @entity52 onto the list of coalition targets threatens to reverse this moderating process , to the detriment of international interests , " he said of the apparent targeting of the group .			0
