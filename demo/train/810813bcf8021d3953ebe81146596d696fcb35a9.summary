@entity0 , @entity1 -- three members of an @entity5 immigrant family , who were found guilty of murder in what the judge called " a completely twisted concept of honor , " intend to appeal their convictions			2
a @entity13 jury on sunday convicted @entity14 , 58 ; his wife , @entity16 , 42 ; and their son , @entity17 , 21 , of first - degree murder in the deaths of @entity14 's three teenage daughters and his first wife in his polygamous marriage			1
sunday 's verdicts followed a three - month trial , in which jurors heard wiretaps of @entity14 referring to his daughters as " whores " and ranting about their behavior			1
all three were sentenced to life in prison immediately after their convictions , with no chance of parole for 25 years			1
a lawyer for the son , @entity17 , told the @entity38 news agency his client and the client 's parents will file an appeal , but he did not say when			2
in announcing the verdict , judge @entity43 told the court it was " difficult to conceive of a more despicable , more heinous crime			0
" " the apparent reason behind these cold - blooded shameful murders was that the four completely innocent victims offended your twisted notion of honor , a notion of honor that is founded upon the domination and control of women , a sick notion of honor that has absolutely no place in any civilized society			0
" outside the courtroom , @entity61 , the chief prosecutor in the case , called it a " good day for @entity13 justice			1
" at least one @entity14 family supporter interrupted @entity61 with shouts of " lies " and called the verdict a " miscarriage of justice			1
" but others cheered the verdict as @entity61 continued			0
the three @entity14 sisters -- @entity74 , 19 , @entity75 , 17 , and @entity76 , 13 -- were found dead inside a car that plunged into the @entity78 in @entity0 on june 30 , 2009			1
@entity14 's first wife , 52 - year - old @entity79 , also died			1
the verdicts came on the second day of deliberations for a seven - woman , five - man jury in @entity0 , about 280 km ( 175 miles ) west of the family 's home in @entity86			1
prosecutors said the girls ' father , mother and brother all plotted to kill the four women in an " honor " murder			0
investigators claimed that hours of wiretapped conversations revealed a premeditated plan to punish rebellious , westernized daughters and their permissive advocate , @entity99			1
@entity14 and @entity100 admitted on the stand that they were upset with @entity74 for running off to marry a @entity103 man they hated , that @entity75 wore revealing clothes and had secret boyfriends , and @entity76 was failing in school and calling social workers to get her out of a home in turmoil			1
prosecutors argued that under instructions from his father , @entity16 used the family @entity114 to ram the other family car carrying the women into the canal			1
the shattered headlight on the @entity114 , prosecutors said , matches the damage on the rear bumper of the family @entity124 in which the women were found dead			1
investigators also believed the victims might have died before they hit the water , because they were unable to escape despite their seat belts being unbuckled and the car being submerged in just 7 feet of water			1
in the three - month - long trial , @entity14 testified , " my children did a lot of cruelty toward me , " as he wept openly on the stand			1
he went on to say he believed his children " betrayed " him by dating and he did not hide his anger , saying a father would never expect that kind of behavior from this daughters			0
in taking the stand , @entity14 swore to tell the truth on the @entity146 , and he again invoked the holy book to say @entity148 does not condone killing people to preserve a family 's honor			1
in a direct response to a question from prosecutor @entity154 , @entity14 said , " to kill someone , you ca n't regain your respect and honor			1
respected lady , you should know that			0
in our religion , a person who kills his wife or daughter , there is nothing more dishonorable			2
how is it possible that someone would do that to their children , respected lady ? " " you might do it , " @entity154 calmly replied , " if you thought they were whores			0
" @entity14 had used that term in a conversation captured by wiretaps			2
investigators played hours of the wiretap recordings in court , alleging many conversations involving the three suspects prove they were plotting murder			2
in some of the most shocking conversations , @entity14 launched into a rant about his daughters ' behavior			1
" i say to myself , ' you did well			0
would they come back to life a hundred times , you should so the same again , ' " he says			2
and in another tape played in court and translated from the @entity5 language @entity197 , he says , " may the devil defecate on their graves ! this is what a daughter should be ? would a daughter be such a whore ? " @entity14 and his lawyers tried to explain that his shocking words are traditional expressions in @entity197 that should not be translated literally			2
but the jury also heard from an expert witness on honor murders -- a term @entity2 is using in the interest of clarity rather than the more common " honor killings " because the latter phrase does not properly describe the alleged crime			0
that witness , @entity218 professor @entity217 , said that in some families , honor is worth more than life			2
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity217 said that many times , honor crimes are calculated acts that involve more than one family member			0
" there is a very important difference between honor killing and violence against women in the form of domestic violence			0
it is plotted , it is premeditated			2
" what we need to understand is that the male power and the male desire for the control of the woman 's body and the woman 's sexuality -- the honor resides in that sort of understanding and the ownership of women 's body and sexuality , " she said			0
" so when that is being presented in a way that is not acceptable to the social norm , then the only way the honor can be restored is by purifying that			0
and the purification is through blood			0
" sometimes , such murders occur with the " buy - in " of women in the family , said @entity262 , director of the @entity263 at @entity264 , who also authored the book " @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268			0
" " this is part and parcel of a cultural tradition called honor , which is a tribal tradition that emphasizes the family or the tribe of the community over the individual , " she said monday			0
it is not an @entity148 phenomenon , she said , but " it is , however , a problem within @entity148 because of how @entity281 often confuse culture and religion			0
you ca n't blame non-muslims for scratching their heads and wondering what the hell is going on			0

the defendants are sentenced to life in prison
the prosecutor calls it a " good day for @entity13 justice "
