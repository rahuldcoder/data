@entity0 -- the @entity2 , for obvious reasons , prefer their politicians dull			1
the current @entity2 chancellor , @entity5 , more than meets local expectations			1
so on the rare occasion when @entity5 says something vivid , something important must be going on			1
speaking in @entity11 on saturday , chancellor @entity5 told a gathering of young @entity13 that multiculturalism has failed			1
that might seem to be saying the obvious			2
item : december 20 , 2007			0
two young men are smoking on a @entity18 subway train , where smoking is prohibited			0
a fellow passenger , a 76 - year - old pensioner , asks them to stop			0
what happened next was captured on surveillance cameras			0
the young men call the old man a " s --- @entity2 " and savagely beat and kick him , fracturing his skull			1
other passengers on the train failed to intervene			0
one of the attackers was a @entity31 immigrant , 17			0
the other , 20 , was born in @entity2 of @entity34 parents			1
the @entity18 train story captured the attention of the country , symbolizing an apparent deterioration of public order driven by multicultural immigration			2
after the attack , @entity42 governor @entity41 asked : : " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? " there are more than 15 million people living in @entity2 who were either born outside @entity2 or whose parents were born outside @entity2			1
that amounts to almost 20 percent of the population			0
this immigrant population is disproportionately connected to almost all of the social problems of modern @entity2			1
yet the problem that has transfixed the country is , very understandably , the problem of crime			2
in @entity63 , young men of immigrant stock are three times as likely to commit a crime as young men of @entity2 background , reports @entity2 's state broadcaster , @entity69			1
in a september interview , chancellor @entity5 endorsed claims that religious young men of @entity74 origin were more likely to commit acts of violence than other young @entity2			1
these crimes seem increasingly the work of criminal gangs of immigrant origin that organize resistance to police authority in what the @entity2 media -- with tabloid exaggeration -- increasingly call " no go areas			1
" violent assaults upon police officers jumped 60 percent between 2005 and 2009 , according to the @entity2 newspaper @entity89			2
less spectacular -- but as important to ordinary people 's feelings of security -- is the perceived deterioration of public order : declining schools , rising welfare rolls and foiled terrorist attacks			2
because of very low birth rates among old - stock @entity2 , the proportion of foreign - born is highest among those younger than 20s			2
in the poor @entity63 neighborhood of @entity104 , three out of four students and at least half the parents lived on unemployment benefits and welfare , even before the global economic crisis			2
in 2005 , the @entity110 interviewed a teacher in a wedding high school : " in wedding , [ @entity115 ] @entity114 says , immigrant children today speak poorer @entity2 and have less contact with @entity2 culture than when she started teaching 20 years ago			2
many @entity74 students ... go to @entity122 classes outside of school and speak only @entity34 or @entity124 at home			0
meanwhile , the growth of digital television has made a host of @entity34 - and arabic - language channels available , intensifying language problems and nurturing identities that are informed more by the @entity134 - @entity133 conflict or the war in @entity136 than by the local @entity2 environment			1
" a high - tech economy offers few opportunities for the poorly educated , with the result that immigrants and their children increasingly find themselves dependent on public assistance			0
in the @entity145 , immigrants are less likely than the native - born to collect welfare or other social benefits			1
in @entity150 , immigrants are radically more likely than the native - born to collect welfare and social benefits , with @entity154 immigrants collecting the most of all			1
that 's the findings of a 2005 study by researchers at @entity162 's @entity161			0
@entity150 voters have absorbed these uncomfortable data into a suspicious view of newcomer intentions : according to a recent study by the @entity169 think tank , 34.3 percent of @entity2 believe that migrants come to @entity2 primarily to receive welfare benefits			1
@entity5 's @entity11 speech did not cite those social problems			1
in @entity2 , the problems created by immigration literally go without saying , and those who do try to talk about them rapidly find themselves ejected from public life			1
@entity179 , a governor of the @entity181 ( and it 's worth mentioning , a member of the left - of - center @entity184 ) was pressured to resign his post in september after publishing a book arguing the failure of @entity2 's absorption of immigrants			2
yet in the words of @entity191 , the repressed always return			0
even if @entity2 and the other @entity193 countries can prevent the immigration population from growing -- and that is a very uncertain if -- they must find ways to deal with integrating the immigrant population already present , both first - and second - generation			1
it 's safe to say that no country in @entity150 is succeeding at that all - important job			2
two weeks ago , i visited the @entity205 city of @entity206			0
in 2005 , the city had been torn by riots that erupted about 50 yards from the lawyer 's office in which i met with four community activists			0
the riots were sparked when a rumor spread through the neighborhood 's @entity216 population that some @entity219 youths had gang - raped a black girl			0
that rumor proved false , but only after blacks and @entity223 had fought two days of street battles that left two people dead			0
i asked these local leaders how things had changed since 2005			0
the answer : not very much at all			0
the authorities had responded to the riots by infusing more money into the community and by intensifying police patrols			0
but the mutual suspicions between groups had not been allayed			0
one of the four activists i met was obviously uncomfortable speaking @entity240 , even though born and raised in the @entity205			0
one said to me very poignantly : " the @entity205 do n't know who they are , so they ca n't teach us how to adapt			2
" on the other hand , it 's not so clear how much the newcomers want to adapt			0
the man who spoke poor @entity240 had spent his entire life inside an @entity249 school system , memorizing the @entity122 in @entity124			0
hard to see how that form of knowledge would equip anyone for life in a modern technological society			0
chancellor @entity5 's @entity11 speech raised the question : could more be done to accelerate immigrant adaptation ? unfortunately the speech offered few answers			1
quietly , some @entity150 are wondering whether @entity150 -- by stumbling into an @entity145 - style immigration policy -- has willy - nilly forced itself to follow other @entity145 policies as well : -- tougher law enforcement and longer prison sentences to fight crime			1
-- a less generous welfare state that compels migrants to work rather than collect benefits paid for by the native - born			1
-- a stronger assertion of national identity -- and a more emphatic demand that newcomers adapt to the existing society			0
these days , many @entity145 conservatives are warning that the @entity145 is going the way of @entity150			1
but maybe the real story is the reverse : is it @entity150 that will soon be imitating the @entity145 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity282 .			1

@entity2 chancellor @entity5 said multiculturalism has n't worked
@entity282 notes crime , other social problems resulted from immigration into @entity2
he says @entity150 may need tougher law enforcement , less generous welfare state
@entity295 : will @entity150 soon be imitating the @entity145 on immigration policies ?
