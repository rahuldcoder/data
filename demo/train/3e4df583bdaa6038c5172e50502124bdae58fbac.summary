@entity2 security forces routinely torture people -- including women and children -- taken in as suspects or for interrogation , @entity0 has claimed in a graphic new report			1
in the study , released thursday , the rights group alleges systemic use of torture by the police , based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over the course of 10 years			1
people are often detained in dragnet operations and tortured as punishment , to extort money or to extract " confessions " as a shortcut to " solve " cases , it claims			0
the report , titled " ' welcome to hell fire ' : torture and other ill - treatment in @entity2 " alleges that abuse is so widespread that many police stations have an informal " officer in charge of torture " and that some police sections have special rooms , or " torture chambers " where it is carried out			1
methods commonly used include nail or tooth extractions , choking , electric shocks , rape and other sexual violence , it claims			1
a spokesman for the @entity47 refuted the allegations , however , saying the report contained " some blatant falsehoods and innuendos			1
" " torture or ill - treatment is not , repeat , not an official policy of the @entity47 , " said @entity52 , force public relations officer and acting commissioner of police , in a statement			1
@entity0 says its researchers interviewed victims , their families , rights defenders and current and former police officers to compile the report			1
@entity66 crackdown the number of reported abuses has increased in northern @entity2 as @entity2 's security forces have stepped up their fight against @entity66 , the report said			1
since 2009 , between 5,000 and 10,000 people have been detained as suspects in the crackdown on the militant @entity77 group , which is designated as a terror organization by the @entity79			0
one man , identified only as @entity81 , said he was among a group of men who were stopped by soldiers outside a mosque after prayers in @entity88 in february 2013			0
he said the soldiers " told all of us to lie down on the ground in the street			0
" " the soldiers shot and killed some of them on the spot , some were shot on the legs , and the soldiers began to beat some of us on the head with iron rods , others were beaten with wood			0
" the men were taken by vehicles to prison , @entity81 said , and some of the wounded men died on the way			0
once there , they were " kept tied for three days , " fed only " handfuls " of food per day , and forced to share a half - liter of water per two men per day			2
the report goes on to quote @entity81 : the beating , the torture was just too much for us			2
they do all types of things to you , the soldiers			0
they will tie your hands behind your back , with the elbows touching and then one of them will walk on your tied hands with their boots			0
your hands will remain tied and then they 'll pour salt water on your wounds			0
you ca n't rub it , even if it goes into your eyes			0
my eyes got swollen as a result of that			0
i thought i was going to be blind			0
i have never experienced such brutality in my life			0
" ' i was bleeding ' " this goes far beyond the appalling torture and killing of suspected @entity66 members , " said @entity143 , @entity0 's research and advocacy director for @entity145			1
" across the country , the scope and severity of torture inflicted on @entity2 's women , men and children by the authorities supposed to protect them is shocking to even the most hardened human rights observer			1
" @entity143 called for @entity2 's @entity159 to take the " long overdue step " of passing a law to criminalize torture , which is banned under the country 's constitution and international treaties			1
the report also cited examples of abuse against women and children			0
@entity174 , a 15 - year - old boy from @entity88 in northern @entity2 , " was arrested by soldiers with around 50 other people , mainly boys between 13 and 19 years old , " the report stated			1
@entity0 said the military " held him for three weeks , beat him repeatedly with their gun butts , batons and machetes , poured melting plastic on his back , made him walk and roll over broken bottles and forced him to watch other detainees being executed ( without trial )			2
@entity174 was freed in april 2013 , according to the report			0
military in @entity88 even arrested and beat a 12 - year - old boy , poured alcohol on him , forced him to clean vomit with his bare hands and stepped on him			2
one 24 - year - old woman named @entity192 told @entity0 she was abused using tear gas and still suffers as a result			1
" a policewoman took me to a small room , told me to remove everything i was wearing , " she is quoted as saying			0
" she spread my legs wide and fired tear gas into my vagina ... i was asked to confess that i was an armed robber ... i was bleeding ... up till now i still feel pain in my womb			0
" ' not systemic or endemic ' @entity52 said the @entity47 has been " undergoing systematic reforms , and aligning themselves with the demands of democracy " but that it has significantly improved its human rights record since 1999			1
" the police do not routinely torture suspects , " he said			2
" it is not systemic or endemic			2
whenever instances of human rights abuses are brought to the notice of superintending officers , the offending personnel are promptly sanctioned in line with the laws and regulations			0
" the @entity0 reporters did not speak to the police authorities , he said , which denied them the opportunity to have a fair hearing			1
he called on @entity0 to provide specific details of the allegations and said they would be investigated			2
@entity143 dismissed the @entity2 police response to the @entity0 report			1
" the police decision to deny the findings before careful reading of the report or examining the accusations made in it echoes their attitude to criminal investigations -- apportioning blame before ascertaining the facts			2
" their pledge to investigate abuses rings hollow so long as they continue to refute our evidence of systemic torture , gathered from more than 500 cases and including testimony from current and former police officers			1
