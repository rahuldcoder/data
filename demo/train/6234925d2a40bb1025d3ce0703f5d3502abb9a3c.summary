-- the @entity2 minister who was defrocked for officiating his son 's same - sex wedding was reinstated tuesday by the @entity5			1
@entity6 , pastor at @entity7 of @entity8 in @entity9 , had his credentials restored and is now entitled to lost salary and benefits since his defrocking in december , according to a written decision released by the church			1
@entity6 was waiting for a phone call to inform him of the church 's verdict , when he received the happy news as an e-mail attachment			1
he opened up the @entity22			0
" i had to scroll all the way to the bottom to find out what the verdict was , and the verdict was that i am reinstated as an ordained minister of the @entity5 , " he told a group of people			0
his suspension @entity6 was suspended for 30 days following his initial trial , with the condition that after his suspension he was to deliver a written report assuring the judiciary board that going forward he would never officiate another same - sex wedding			1
when @entity6 refused to do so , he was defrocked			0
@entity6 told @entity0 then that he could not commit to a statement like that because he has two more children who are gay			0
his appeal was heard friday by a nine - member committee , which upheld the original 30 - day suspension that @entity6 had already served			2
bishop @entity46 , leader of the church 's @entity47 , said in a statement that she will abide by the committee 's decision and will return @entity6 to active service as an ordained clergy member			1
the appellate committee unanimously determined that @entity6 's defrocking was " unlawful " because a clergyman can only be punished for what he has been convicted of doing in the past , not for what he may or may not do in the future , the decision read			2
" i ca n't even begin to describe how meaningful this ' refrocking ' is to me , " @entity6 said in a statement immediately following the appeal decision			2
" i never did understand the severity of my punishment for an act of love for my son , @entity68 , " @entity6 said			2
the @entity5 says it welcomes members regardless of sexual orientation , but same - sex marriages can not be performed in @entity5 churches or by ordained ministers under church policy			1
how it started the initial complaint was filed by one of @entity6 's church members who read about his son 's wedding in a newspaper , and the church leadership decided to act upon it , @entity6 said			1
@entity6 was found guilty by a jury of 13 clergy members and suspended for 30 days in november 2013			0
after his suspension @entity6 told the @entity87 that he could not uphold the church 's @entity88 in its entirety because it discriminates against gay people			2
@entity6 was asked to immediately surrender his credentials , but he refused , forcing church officials to defrock him , the statement said			2
@entity6 previously told @entity0 's @entity95 that his son asked him to officiate his wedding in 2007 and he decided to do it " out of love for him			1
" although he once believed that homosexuality was incompatible with his @entity103 beliefs , @entity6 said his views on the controversial topic evolved			0
" by the time our son came out , i was ready to embrace him , " @entity6 told @entity95			0
a precedent case in march , the @entity5 dropped its case against a @entity112 clergyman , @entity111 , who had also officiated his son 's same - sex wedding			1
@entity111 was instead ordered to join others from varying perspectives in a public forum that " shall reflect a variety of different opinions and understandings			0
" upon hearing of that decision , @entity6 told @entity0 in march , " it does n't seem fair , two @entity5 minsters are charged with the same exact ' crime ' of officiating at their son 's same - sex weddings -- one is defrocked , the other one 's case is dropped without conditions			1
" @entity131 , the first @entity5 minister to be defrocked over performing a same - sex marriage ceremony in 1999 , acted as an adviser to @entity6 during the trial			1
" the decision is a win for @entity6 , for the @entity5 , and for the movement toward justice and equality for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender @entity5 , " @entity131 said in a statement			0
@entity6 said that he is now considering an offer to serve in the ministry of the @entity147 - @entity146 of the @entity5			0
" today 's decision shows that the church is moving toward love over legalism , " @entity6 said in his statement tuesday			1
" their movement of love embraced me and together we are moving forward to bring about that day when our denomination no longer excludes any of @entity159 's beloved children			0
and i will continue to work toward that goal , " he said .			0
