-- this week , the @entity2 @entity1 considers the case challenging the @entity7 administration health care plan 's requirement that most @entity2 purchase a government - approved health insurance plan by 2014			1
the court should rule that this individual mandate is unconstitutional			2
to do otherwise would give @entity12 almost unlimited power			1
the federal government argues that three provisions of the @entity16 -- the commerce clause , the tax clause and the " necessary and proper " clause -- authorize the health care mandate			1
the commerce clause gives @entity12 authority to regulate interstate commerce			1
since the 1930s , @entity1 decisions have interpreted the commerce clause broadly			1
but every previous case expanding the commerce power involved some sort of " economic activity , " such as operating a business or consuming a product			2
failure to purchase health insurance is neither commerce nor an interstate activity			1
indeed , it is the absence of commerce			0
if @entity12 could use that clause to regulate mere failure to buy a product on the grounds that such inaction has an economic effect , there would be no structural limits to its power			1
any decision to do anything is necessarily a decision not to do something else that might have an economic effect			0
if i spend an hour sleeping , i thereby choose not to spend it working or shopping			0
as the lower court decision in this case explained , the government 's position " amounts to an argument that the mere fact of an individual 's existence substantially affects interstate commerce , and therefore @entity12 may regulate them at every point of their life			1
" read a transcript of monday 's @entity1 arguments defenders of the insurance mandate claim that health care is a special case because everyone eventually uses it			1
but this argument relies on shifting the focus from health insurance to health care			1
a similar rhetorical ploy can justify any other mandate , including even the " broccoli purchase mandate			2
" not everyone eats broccoli			0
but everyone participates in the market for food			0
similarly , a mandate requiring all @entity2 to purchase a car can be justified because virtually everyone participates in the transportation market			0
the government also claims that health care is different because producers are sometimes required to give free emergency services to the uninsured			1
but why is this fact constitutionally relevant ? the answer seems to be that failure to buy insurance thereby has adverse economic effects on producers			0
put that way , failure to buy health insurance turns out to be no different from failure to buy any other product			2
any time someone fails to purchase any product , producer profits are lower than they would be otherwise			0
the government 's tax - clause argument is similarly flawed			1
it asserts that the individual mandate is n't really a restriction on freedom , it 's just a tax ; violators are forced to pay a fine			0
if this logic is correct , it would justify any mandate enforced by a monetary fine , whether it be for broccoli , a car or anything else			0
every lower court to have considered this constitutional issue has ruled that the mandate is not a tax but a penalty			2
as president @entity7 acknowledged in 2009 , " for us to say that you 've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase			1
" finally , the government relies on the clause that gives @entity12 the power to " make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution " other powers the @entity16 grants it			1
the federal government argues that the insurance mandate is a " necessary " element of its regulation of the health care market under the commerce clause			1
the court has previously defined " necessary " broadly as anything that might be " useful " or " convenient			0
" but even if the mandate is necessary , it is not " proper			0
" the court has previously ruled that these are two separate requirements and both must be met			0
what makes a federal law " proper " ? at the very least , a proper law can not depend on a rationale that gives @entity12 virtually unlimited power			1
as @entity162 said : " whatever meaning this clause may have , none can be admitted that would give an unlimited discretion to @entity12			2
" if the " necessary and proper " clause allows @entity12 to adopt the individual mandate , the same logic would justify almost any other mandate			1
virtually every mandate has some economic effect and could be portrayed as a " useful or convenient " way to regulate some market			0
a broccoli mandate could be defended as an effort to regulate the market in food			0
the threat to liberty raised by this case is n't just theoretical			0
many industries would be happy to lobby for laws requiring people to buy their products , and @entity12 has a long history of enacting special - interest legislation			2
in a recent decision , the @entity1 unanimously emphasized that constitutional constraints on federal power protect state rights as well as " the liberty of the individual			2
" @entity191 will be left of that protection if the justices uphold the individual mandate			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 says @entity1 should find @entity7 health care plan unconstitutional
he says commerce clause argument flawed , gives huge regulatory power to @entity12
he argues tax - clause argument also a *problem* , saying failure to insure brings penalty , not a tax
@entity197 : necessary and proper argument could allow @entity12 to justify any mandate
