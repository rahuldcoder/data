@entity0 -- round two of the battle of the propofol experts started thursday afternoon in the trial of @entity7 's doctor as the defense anesthesiology expert began his testimony			1
when dr. @entity10 continues his testimony friday , and he is expected to counter the conclusions of prosecution anesthesiologist dr. @entity12 , whose earlier testimony spanned more than a week of dr. @entity15 's involuntary manslaughter trial			1
dr. @entity10 said that after reviewing the reports , evidence and analysis from investigators in @entity7 's death he was not convinced dr. @entity15 was responsible			1
" i was somewhat perplexed at how a determination has been made that dr. @entity15 was infusing propofol , " @entity10 said			2
" it was n't obvious to me , i thought there were questions			0
" a drug - addiction specialist testified earlier thursday that @entity7 was " probably addicted " to a powerful painkiller given him during frequent visits to a @entity32 dermatologist in the three months before his death			1
dr. @entity34 was called by the defense in an effort to show @entity7 's insomnia the day he died could have been caused by withdrawal from @entity40 shots he was given along with botox injections , treatments that dr. @entity15 did n't know about			1
@entity10 , who is the last witness before the defense rests , spent most of the first two hours establishing his credentials as one of the world 's foremost experts on the surgical anesthetic propofol , which the coroner ruled was the chief drug that killed @entity7			2
the personal and professional rivalry between dr. @entity10 and dr. @entity12 played an odd role in thursday 's testimony			0
@entity10 's longtime friendship with @entity12 has been tested during the @entity15 trial , including an incident last week that resulted in the judge scheduling a contempt - of - court hearing against @entity10 for next month			1
at one point thursday , @entity10 suggested someone " tell dr. @entity12 he needs to learn how to spell plasma , " because it was misspelled on a graph he created			0
@entity10 , however , attempted to downplay rivalry with @entity12 when the judge mistakenly called @entity67 " for a second time			0
" i take it as a compliment , actually , " @entity10 said			0
@entity10 and @entity12 , who are on opposite sides in this trial , may have a new anesthesia product to develop as a result of their preparations to testify , @entity10 said			0
both experts commissioned studies on the possibility that @entity7 might have orally ingested the fatal dose of propofol , something they both have now ruled out			0
but they learned that propofol could be absorbed through the tissues of the mouth , @entity10 said			0
he and @entity12 agreed during courthouse chats while waiting to testify that they might be able to develop a propofol lollipop as a " non-invasive sedation device			0
" @entity12 testified last week that he concluded the " only scenario " that fits the scientific evidence is that @entity7 was on an iv drip of propofol for three hours before his death and that @entity15 failed to notice when he stopped breathing			1
@entity12 conceded that it was possible that @entity7 , not @entity15 , could have been the one to open the drip to a fatal pace , but prosecutors contend it would make no difference in @entity15 's guilt			1
the defense hopes the testimony from @entity10 and @entity34 , their last two witnesses , will convince jurors that @entity7 gave himself the overdose of drugs that killed him while @entity15 was not watching			2
the @entity110 coroner ruled @entity7 's june 25 , 2009 , death was the result of " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with several sedatives			2
the defense theory is that a desperate @entity7 , fearing his comeback concerts could be canceled unless he found elusive sleep , self - administered propofol that @entity15 was trying to wean him off of			2
prosecutors contend @entity15 is responsible for his death even if he did not give him the final and fatal dose because he was criminally reckless in using the surgical anesthetic to help @entity7 sleep without proper precautions			2
the defense contends @entity7 became addicted to the painkiller @entity40 through frequent visits to the @entity32 dermatology clinic of dr. @entity130 in the months before his death			1
@entity15 was unaware of the addiction , and therefore unable to understand why he could not help @entity7 sleep , the defense contends			1
during thursday morning 's testimony by dr. @entity34 , the addiction specialist , defense lawyer @entity132 displayed dr. @entity130 's medical records for @entity7 , kept under the name " @entity140			1
" the showed at least 24 visits from march 12 until june 22 , 2009 , three days before his death			0
the defense previously said @entity7 was given 6,500 milligrams of @entity40 at @entity130 's clinic during those visits			1
@entity7 received 900 milligrams of @entity40 at @entity130 's clinic over three days in early may , the records showed			1
dr. @entity34 called the shots " stiff doses			0
" @entity34 testified that from his review of those medical records and " based on what is known of his public behavior that he was probably addicted " to @entity40			0
" six weeks of very frequent high - dose use would develop opioid dependence in any of us , " @entity34 said			0
the defense also sought to connect the @entity40 shots to @entity7 's poor health at some rehearsals for his comeback concerts and at other times when he complained of being being hot and cold at the same time			1
patients describe opioid withdrawal as like " the worst case of influenza they ever had , " @entity34 said			0
while @entity40 was not found in @entity7 's blood or body during his autopsy , the defense contends it played a major role in his death			1
his inability to sleep , which @entity15 was trying to resolve the day he died , could have been a direct symptom of his withdrawal from the drug			0
" anxiety , restlessness and insomnia " are " very common " symptoms of @entity40 withdrawal , @entity34 said			1
@entity7 's personal assistant , @entity180 , testified earlier that @entity7 's visits to dr. @entity130 were " very regular " in his last months of life			2
" there were times he would go almost every day " to @entity130 's office , and @entity7 often appear intoxicated when he left , @entity7 's security chief @entity184 testified			2
@entity190 judge @entity189 ruled earlier that while the defense could use @entity130 's medical records , they could not call the doctor or his staff to testify in the trial .			0
