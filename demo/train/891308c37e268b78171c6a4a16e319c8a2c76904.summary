" former @entity49 analyst : @entity20 is ' at peace with his decisions ' the @entity9 's @entity52 said @entity5 was a " remarkable journalist " and that it had been " fantastic " to work with him			1

we wish him all the best			0
" @entity65 government and press collide in bullying of reporter 's partner ' enormous damage ' the @entity9 has come under fire in recent days from figures in the @entity65 intelligence community who suggest its reporting has undermined efforts to keep the country safe in the face of terror threats			1
both @entity5 and @entity9 have accused @entity65 authorities of using heavy - handed tactics to try to silence legitimate reporting			1

" such information hands the advantage to the terrorists			0
it is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will			0
unfashionable as it might seem , that is why we must keep secrets secret , and why not doing so causes such harm			0
" @entity138 afraid during questioning @entity114 did not name @entity9 or @entity20 in his comments but said that the information gleaned about terrorists and " the detail of the capabilities we use against them " was what gave intelligence services their " margin of advantage " -- a margin , he said , that is now " under attack			0
