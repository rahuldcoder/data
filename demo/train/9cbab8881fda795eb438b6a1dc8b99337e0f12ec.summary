-- in front of cameras and on the pages of widely promoted books , the wives of a few high - profile cheating husbands have been finding and broadcasting their own voices , a pronounced shift that has some who study infidelity applauding			1
available in bookstores friday is " staying @entity13 " by @entity14 , who filed for divorce in december from @entity17 gov. @entity16 , whose affair with an @entity20 woman was exposed by reporters after he disappeared for several days last summer			1
staffers said he was hiking the @entity24			2
he later admitted he was actually in @entity25 with his mistress			0
@entity16 's published perspective is the latest addition to a small library of books written by wives betrayed by their prominent husbands			1
and the book arrives with perhaps the shortest time between marital shock and print			0
@entity36 was one of the first political wives to make the public about - face with the release in 2007 of " silent partner : a memoir of my marriage			1
" she stood shellshocked three years earlier , by the side of her then - husband , @entity46 gov. @entity45 , as he stepped up to a microphone , quit the office , and came out as a " gay @entity49			0
" @entity50 provided a glimpse into her journey with " resilience : reflections on the @entity57 of facing life 's adversities , " published last may and months before she and her husband , former @entity55 presidential candidate @entity54 , eventually separated			1
so what happened to the women who used to stand silently by their disgraced husbands ? " while we look at these women as political wives , " said @entity0 senior political correspondent @entity63 , " some of these wives are powerful career women or have been powerful career women			1
" and these women have grown up in an entirely different age which gives them more choices about how to deal with an unfaithful husband , said @entity63 , who now hosts @entity0 's " @entity75			1
" wives can now publicly opt to let their husbands clean up their own messes			1
and that is one reason why former investment banker @entity14 wrote her book , says publisher @entity82 on its web site			1
" she chose to let @entity16 deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character , even in the face of the lies their father has told , " says the synopsis of her book on the site			0
and it 's not just the marital foibles of political leaders that are seeing print			1
@entity106 , wife of former mega-church pastor and evangelical leader @entity108 , recently published " why i stayed , " in which she explained how her marriage has grown stronger since her husband 's infidelity was revealed			1
though each woman 's story is unique and their current marital statuses vary , what they seem to have in common is that they are not , like so many under - the - spotlight wives before them , staying silent			1
" by speaking out they 're giving the public a peek behind the curtain , " said @entity122 , author of " is he cheating on you ? 829 @entity123 " and founder of @entity127			2
" these wives who are telling it like it is are doing a wonderful service to others who are or may become victims of infidelity			1
" when @entity140 found out more than 16 years ago that her first husband was cheating on her , she said , she wished she 'd had touchstones like these women and their books to turn to			1
instead , she said , she found herself grasping for answers in bookstores where the selection was slim and the references hard to come by			0
" how could this happen in a good marriage ? how could it happen to me ? how do i handle it , " @entity140 , who 's been remarried for 10 years now , remembers asking herself over and over again			2
" i vowed that once i got over it , i would make it my mission to get information into the hands of people who need it most -- the infidelity victims , both men and women			1
" @entity140 has spent 16 years studying infidelity and interviewing couples			2
" what started out as a fact - finding mission , " she said , " turned into a second career			0
" the key to avoiding problems , said @entity140 , is not assuming your marriage will be safe from infidelity and being aware of clues that there might be trouble			2
" we do a breast exam every single month , " she said , and looking out for warning signs in a pair of people is equally important			0
the earlier that problems , including infidelity , are caught and discussed , " the better the chances are for survival in your relationship			2
" this kind of thinking was generally foreign to women of earlier generations			0
for seven long years , starting in the 1960s , @entity187 had suspicions about her husband			0
she did n't dare say a word about the feared affairs , though -- not to him or her friends			0
instead , she did what she thought wives were supposed to do			2
she kept her worries to herself and allowed the not knowing to gnaw at and , in fact , torture her			0
simply put , she said , " that 's how it was back then			2
" but when the truth came out in 1974 , and after they fought through their feelings and emerged stronger , she and her psychologist husband , @entity202 , did something that was unheard of at the time			0
they wrote a book in 1980 about their experiences and agreed to talk publicly about their painful journey			0
their book " @entity216 , " which publishers initially would n't touch , sent them off on the tv circuit			0
@entity219 dedicated a full hour to their story			0
" as long as it feels like it 's too awful to talk about , it 'll feel like it 's too awful to get over it , " said @entity222 , 73 , author of " @entity223 " and host of the @entity225 at @entity226			2
and talking about it , she said , made her feel empowered and her marriage work			0
" the more i did it , the better i felt , the stronger i felt , " @entity222 said			0
" i was the one who owned it			0
" this , however , does n't mean that the public -- so quick to condemn affairs and yet eager for details -- needs to be privy to every salacious twist and turn , @entity222 said			0
she said she disapproves of books such as @entity243 's recent tell - all , " @entity246 , " calling some of the claims he makes about @entity54 and @entity50 " beyond the pale			1
" taking back the story may be especially important for the famous			1
in a time when tabloids , internet chatter and even mainstream media will speculate wildly about famous couples , some , like authors @entity50 and @entity14 , choose to be part of the conversation and not just the topic of it .			1

writing books and doing interviews , wives of famous cheating husbands speak out
@entity14 's " @entity264 , " in stores friday , is the latest example
not taking the *traditional* " stand by your man " approach , infidelity experts applaud honesty
expert : authors provide " service to others who are or may become victims of infidelity "
