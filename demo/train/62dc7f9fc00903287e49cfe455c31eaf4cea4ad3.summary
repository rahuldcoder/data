@entity0 is doing something terrifying and awesome this week : the network is asking you to be my boss			1
you have the power to vote on the stories i 'll do over the next year as part of a new social - justice project called @entity10			1
polls close at 2 p.m. et monday			1
you can find the ballot , with 20 topics to choose from , at @entity15			1
i 'll do the top five			1
i say it 's terrifying because you have me in a state of near - constant panic as i wait to hear which stories i 'll be doing ( at one point on friday morning , the fifth and sixth place stories were tied ) and awesome because this is a great experiment in journalism as democracy , in letting the voices of the people be heard			1
the response has been mostly wonderful			1
as of friday morning , 28,000 ballots had been submitted			1
@entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 all tweeted about it			1
the @entity35 praised the aspirations of the project and said it represents a " very different kind of journalism than the ' infotainment ' that the @entity0 's brand , fairly or not , is known for			1
" ( i 'll take that as a compliment , although you 'd be hard pressed to find anyone who would label @entity47 's work in @entity48 , @entity50 's reports from @entity51 or @entity52 's anything " infotainment			1
" ) and many of you wrote to me personally to say that you appreciated the fact that @entity0 was listening to your points of view			1
" i just wanted to drop a line and say thank you for actually listening and trying			1
" " thank you for your invitation to participate			1
" " thanks for even asking			1
" " to say you have made my day hugely understates the case			1
" the feedback is n't all sunshine and unicorns , of course			1
some of you have tweeted me that this is " not journalism " because the story - selection is crowdsourced			1
others called it a gimmick or a marketing ploy			1
and , on the other end of the who - controls - the - news spectrum , some of you said that it was draconian and old - school of me to present 20 ideas to choose from -- rather than asking you for the story ideas in the first place			1
many of you have e-mailed me with smart , specific story concepts that you hope will be considered for a sixth @entity86 story , which will be chosen by a small group of @entity0 editors			1
perhaps the whole thing could have been crowdsourced			1
it 's too late for that			1
but i did want to air the smart suggestions you shared with me			1
i collected them on a public @entity95 and have listed them below			2
among the most popular write - in ideas : overpopulation , climate change and child abuse in the @entity101			1
the first two surprised me			2
if you look at polls , @entity101 do n't seem to care much for environment and resource issues			2
in a february survey from the @entity107 , only 34 % of @entity101 said climate change was " something that is essential for the @entity110 and @entity111 to tackle this year			2
" this informal feedback suggests that many of you are passionate about these issues			2
" you missed some huge ones that mainstream media is neglecting , " one person wrote in an e-mail			2
" climate change is continuing without much attention			2
resource depletion : peak oil ( end of cheap oil ) , aquifer depletion , fishery depletion , etc. " and another : " at the core of resource , environmental , gender and health issues is human population , a subject most can not manage to accept			2
" i could go on , but instead i 'll hand over the floor to you			1
here are 97 topics you suggested i cover as part of @entity10			1
they 're in no particular order , other than which e-mails and tweets i read first			2
have more ideas ? tweet me : @ jdsutter			2
the wild - card sixth story could come from this list but ultimately will be chosen by @entity0 's editors			1
although i could never cover all these topics alone , i thought it would be helpful to make them public			1
maybe someone else will take up the torch			2
the @entity154 has a similar project , for instance , that aims to crowdsource the " world we want			1
" meanwhile , there 's still plenty of time to vote for the five stories i will cover as part of @entity10			1
winners will be announced tuesday			2
