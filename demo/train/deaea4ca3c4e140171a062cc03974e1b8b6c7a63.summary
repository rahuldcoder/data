a line began to form at the @entity1 here on the eve of the @entity5 release , as is often the case around the world during the company 's product launches			1
at the front of this particular line thursday , @entity10 sits in a @entity14 armchair , sipping @entity15 and scanning e-mails from his white @entity17			1
the @entity19 co-founder , who gets a paycheck of " a couple hundred dollars every two weeks " and still maintains his status as employee no. 1 in company records , has n't been able to stay put for long			1
crowds of @entity19 fans , family friends and people who have seen him riding his segway around the neighborhood stop to say hi , take pictures and ask for his autograph			1
" i 'll be taking a thousand pictures , " @entity10 whispered with a smile			1
" i 'm going to sit down and see if i can get a little e-mail done , because there 's no way i 'm going to get it all done today			0
" seconds later , an enthusiastic man in a yellow polo shirt positioned his two kids near the computer legend and pleaded for him to pose			0
@entity10 immediately sprang to his feet with a grin on his face			1
people brought iphones , ipods and @entity17 for @entity10 to sign with a marker			1
" now your phone is not going to be worth as much when you sell it , " @entity10 said to one woman before signing her @entity52			2
fans gave @entity10 their condolences over the late @entity59 , the @entity19 co-founder who died last week			1
flowers , partially eaten apples and notes were laid in front of @entity1 around the world , including this one , where the memorial was set just a few feet from @entity10 's spot in line			1
@entity10 explained that sending flowers or onetime celebrations are the kinds of traditions he and @entity59 agreed were unnecessary			2
however , he talked openly about how much he misses his high - school pal , with whom he built a technology empire			0
@entity10 acknowledged that he could have easily made one phone call to @entity19 and gotten the phone he 's waiting in line for , but he did n't			1
he has yet to play with an @entity5 or its @entity81 voice - controlled assistant			2
he has said previously that he does not ask colleagues about products in development because he does not want to ruin the surprise for himself			0
" i want to get mine along with the millions of other fans , " @entity10 said			1
" i just want to be able to talk to my phone			0
" analysts have expressed disappointment in the @entity5 , but @entity10 , who looks forward to every new @entity19 device , is especially animated when discussing it			1
over the past year , he has not been shy about his anticipation for voice - assist technology , like the new 4s tool called @entity81			0
people who say they have waited in lines behind @entity10 during past @entity19 releases have written spiteful messages online claiming he had used his celebrity to cut in line just before the stores opened			1
@entity10 said that he is usually further back in line at these events but that fans in front of him insist that he get his devices first			1
on thursday , there is no dispute about @entity10 's place in line			2
his segway , which he rode from his nearby home , is parked in a corner near the store 's entrance			0
@entity10 arrived about noon , and he plans to stay overnight in order to get the new iphone first , he said			1
fifteen minutes after @entity10 arrived , @entity119 , 17 , showed up			1
he first met @entity120 last year in line at a nearby store during the launch of the original @entity17			0
@entity10 and the high school student kept in touch by e-mail and @entity127 , and they were third and fourth in line to buy the @entity52			1
at the @entity17 launch , @entity10 taught @entity119 how to ride a segway			2
" mall security was like , ' you should n't be segwaying in here , ' but nobody is going to say no to @entity10 , obviously , " said @entity132 , who develops @entity52 applications			2
" he does it because he wants to , not for publicity reasons			0
" reporters and cameramen were among the people approaching @entity10 on thursday			2
by 7 p.m. @entity144 , about a dozen people had set up chairs behind @entity10 , and his wife , @entity146 , joined			2
@entity10 said he had already ordered two @entity147 to be delivered to his home ; he 's in line to buy one for his wife			1
before then , a policeman asked @entity10 quietly whether he would need anything and whether the celebrity planned to stay all night			2
@entity10 said that he was but that he might take a jog around the block at 3 a.m. " the line is doing nicely , " @entity10 said after surveying the area			2
some in the queue came out solely because @entity10 was here , which they learned from updates on his @entity164 and @entity165 profiles			0
@entity166 , a prominent @entity167 software developer , also tweeted this afternoon when he spotted @entity120 in line			0
@entity169 , a graduate student at @entity170 , took the bus after seeing @entity10 's tweet			0
@entity173 , a furniture designer who is looking to change jobs , said he came to soak up some inspiration from @entity120			0
" i came out here just so i can hang out with @entity10 for 18 hours , " said @entity173 , who lives in the nearby city of @entity177			0
" i 've been watching him get harassed all day			0
" @entity10 designed the original @entity19 computers , his major triumph , but he is recognized by many people nowadays for his short - lived appearance in 2009 on the @entity185 show " @entity183			1
" " you were awesome on ' @entity183 ! ' " said one fan , who had her picture taken with @entity10			0
" so good ! i voted for you			0
