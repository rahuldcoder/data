i like a little peace and quiet on vacation			0
" now 's the perfect time for that kid - free trip			1
most of the children who would be sharing your view of @entity40 or packing your top three theme park rides have gone back to school			1
if you do n't have kids , here 's your chance to enjoy one of the benefits of not having them -- the freedom to grab cheaper airfares and hotel rooms			1
if you have kids , it could still benefit you to take some time to reconnect with your significant other			1
that 's because the travel industry enters into a so - called shoulder season after @entity58 , when most travelers head back to school or work and airline seats and hotel rooms remain unfilled			1
while @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 were @entity69 's top flight search destinations for @entity58 , users who wait to travel to these destinations until the following weekend could save 8 % to 10 % on airfares , according to a @entity69 spokeswoman			2

in @entity92 , leaf peepers may enjoy rail tours of the @entity121 before winter hits			0
and @entity126 's @entity124 and @entity125 vineyards are offering specials connected to the fall harvest , says @entity95			0
' @entity129 ' makes trips count is it really only for adults ? some vacation spots are exclusively for the 18 - and - older set , while others simply have fewer children present because most children are attending school			1
that does n't mean toddlers , home - schooled children or children with varying school holidays wo n't be present			1
if you want a truly adults - only experience , call your hotel to confirm it 's really for people ages 18 and older			1
within the adults - only category , make sure to do your research to find out what type of " adult " resort you 're booking , says @entity157 senior editor @entity156			2
" on some resorts , ' adult ' can mean risqué while on others , ' adult ' can mean upscale , quiet and private			2
" 12 fascinating @entity163 sites adults - only resorts adults - only resorts can be found around the world			1

for wine lovers , the adults - only @entity193 in @entity126 's @entity194 offers a private wine bar and @entity198 - influenced cuisine of chef @entity199 , a @entity201 transplant from @entity66			2
ranked by @entity202 as a top wine country hotel , the @entity193 has 29 guestrooms and suites , each with a private entrance ( but no television )			0
in @entity66 , within an easy drive of @entity212 museums and 1½ hours from the @entity213 in @entity214 , the intimate @entity209 has just 18 rooms and suites for its guests , some of whom arrive from @entity220 via helicopter			2
the hotel , which was once a private retreat for the wealthy , offers adults a break from the rigors of city life			0
even its two fine dining restaurants , which are open to the public , do not allow anyone under 18 years of age			0
adults - only cruising while some mainstream cruise lines do have adults - only sections , those areas do need to be enforced by ship personnel and would - be cruisers should check to see if passengers report any trouble with " adult " areas being overrun by children			1
if you prefer that question never be raised , @entity157 's @entity156 recommends checking out truly child - free cruises , including those operated by @entity250 's @entity249			0
( make sure to choose an " exclusively for adults " trip rather than a " family friendly " trip			0
) " @entity255 - owned @entity249 has a fleet of seven ships , three of which are exclusively for adults and offer a smaller - scale , more intimate cruising experience , " he says , " though not readily marketed in the @entity83 , they feature several exotic itineraries			1
" making more room at @entity265 it 's unlikely that any visit to a @entity265 theme park will be child - free			1

their passes allow them to book trips up to three months in advance			0
( @entity278 , who is a child psychologist , did n't want to give her last name and be misconstrued as anti-child			0
) " for me it helps to enjoy the experience when i have reasonable expectations , " she says			0
" i had very different desires and expectations when we went to @entity4 for our honeymoon than when we had a family reunion during spring break			0
our honeymoon was during an off - season and our experience was more adult focused			0
" our family reunion had to occur during a school holiday for the children in our lives , " she says			1
" i went in knowing there were going to be crowds and families , the occasional meltdown and need for children - appropriate negotiation			1
both holidays were fantastic and very different			0

with most children in school , destinations are often less crowded , more affordable
some spots are exclusively for the 18 - and - older set ; others have fewer kids present
