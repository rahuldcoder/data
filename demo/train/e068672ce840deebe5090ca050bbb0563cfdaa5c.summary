attorney general @entity7 's six - year tenure as the nation 's chief law enforcement officer has been marked by an activist agenda and political confrontations on a range of legal , policy , and criminal matters			1
" i 've always liked this job			0
i 've had some days that have been better than others , " @entity7 told @entity17 's justice correspondent @entity16 last november			1
he hinted then that his remaining time in office would give him " the ability to focus on issues now that really matter to me			0
" some of those things were sentencing reform for drug offenders and community policing outreach in the wake of the recent shooting of unarmed @entity30 teenager @entity29			0
for the 63 - year - old @entity33 native , it was his way to carve out a modern civil rights legacy that had the blessing of his good friend and confidante , president @entity39			1
@entity7 will announce resignation ordered civil rights probe for @entity42 @entity7 's response to the august shooting of @entity29 , an @entity45 , in the @entity47 suburb of @entity42 may be the lasting memory many @entity49 will have of this attorney general			1
he ordered a broad federal civil rights probe of that city 's mostly white police department , and this week spoke in personal tones about the level of mistrust many racial minorities have toward police			1
" will we yet again turn a blind eye to the hard truths that @entity42 exposed ? " he said tuesday			0
" or will we finally accept this mandate for open and honest dialogue ? " the nation 's first @entity45 attorney general has offered both unqualified support for local law enforcement while suggesting a " remake " of how it deals with many citizens of color			1
" there has been no greater ally in the fight for justice , civil rights , equal rights and voting rights than attorney general holder , " @entity72 , widow of civil rights icon @entity73 , told @entity17 after news broke of @entity7 's decision to step down			1
@entity39 and @entity7 hone their messages on race - tinged issues critics : ' good riddance ' but critics of the @entity92 have their own bitter memories of his tenure , especially on @entity5 , the gun trafficking controversy that led to him becoming the first sitting @entity99 member to be held in contempt of @entity101			1
the @entity102 launched @entity5 out of @entity103 to track weapon purchases by @entity106 drug cartels			0
however , it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border , and two of those lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of @entity118 agent @entity5			0
@entity120 lawmakers had long demanded documents on the operation that @entity7 refused to turn over , launching a major fight over executive privilege			1
" good riddance @entity7 , " tweeted rep. @entity125 , @entity127 - @entity126 , after the thursday announcement			1
" your disregard for the @entity132 will not be missed			2
" who might replace @entity7 ? long - lasting legacy @entity7 's legacy will be felt for years			1
in the coming months , the @entity136 is poised to decide the constitutionality of same - sex marriage , an issue that was largely driven on a national scale by the attorney general			1
he has repeatedly cited the @entity39 administration decision in 2011 to quit defending the @entity144 , which eventually led to the june 2013 @entity136 ruling striking down parts of the law requiring the federal government to deny recognition of legal same - sex marriages			0
that strategy has led to state bans being toppled in rapid succession in the past year			0
gay rights groups say @entity7 's leadership to make it easier for gays and lesbians to legally wed across the @entity49 is seen by many activists as the civil rights issue of the new millennium			1
" i believe we must be suspicious of legal classifications based solely on sexual orientation , " @entity7 said this spring			2
" and we must endeavor -- in all of our efforts -- to uphold and advance the values that once led our forebears to declare unequivocally that all are created equal and entitled to equal opportunity			0
" voting restriction laws @entity7 also recently made a public push to fight what he calls " restrictive state laws " over the ability of voters -- especially minorities -- to cast ballots			2
the @entity92 has sued @entity178 over its voter identification regulations , and a federal appeals court is hearing oral arguments thursday over @entity183 's law limiting same - day registration and early voting			0
such an approach made @entity7 arguably one of the most controversial attorney generals in recent memory			1
" with @entity7 's departure , the nation can begin to heal			2
his was the most divisive tenure of any attorney general i can recall , tearing the country apart on racial and partisan lines , " said @entity191 , a senior fellow at the libertarian @entity192			1
" by not just pushing but breaking through the envelope of plausible legal argument , attorney general holder has done his all to expand federal ( especially executive ) power and contract individual liberty beyond any constitutional recognition			1
@entity7 will not be missed by those who support the rule of law			2
" changes in sentencing guidelines perhaps the issue closest to the attorney general 's heart was working to change sentencing guidelines to give prosecutors more flexibility in certain non-violent criminal cases			1
he and his aides have been pushing for rehabilitation instead of warehousing of prisoners , and getting rid of the disparity in the way the justice system deals with defendants charged in cocaine and crack cocaine crimes			0
he is joined in that effort by sen. @entity227 , @entity228 , and other conservatives who have similar views on expanded individual rights			0
but @entity7 's moves to use administrative memos to make effective changes before @entity101 passes new laws have also generated criticism			2
former attorney general @entity237 told @entity17 's @entity238 recently that he generally agreed with " the goal of getting rid of mandatory minimums ... but the way to do that is to pass a law , not to say you 're going to disregard the law			1
" @entity247 sen. @entity246 , the ranking @entity120 on the @entity248 and a frequent @entity7 critic , has similarly criticized the @entity39 administration for taking action without waiting for @entity101			2
@entity7 endorses shorter sentences for drug offenders efforts on national security on the national security front , @entity7 has been unsuccessful in his desire to close the @entity259 military prison , where mostly @entity261 terror suspects and other " enemy combatants " are being held , over the strong objections of many nations and international human rights groups			1
his department cites the successful prosecution of dozens of terror suspects in the civilian criminal justice system			0
@entity7 this month also announced a program to try to thwart recruitment by extremist groups such as @entity272 , attempting to involve social and mental health workers as well as religious leaders and police to spot radicalization early			2
it was an effort to blend community outreach programs with stepped - up government surveillance , especially toward young @entity49 who would be willing to go overseas and join terror groups , including in @entity281			0
despite those efforts , authorities say more than 100 @entity49 have traveled in recent years to join groups involved in the @entity281 civil war			2
more than a dozen are believed to have joined @entity272 , which calls itself the @entity287			0
" i think it 's just a matter of time before they start looking outward and start looking at the @entity293 and at the @entity49 in particular , " @entity7 warned this summer , referring to @entity272 recruitment efforts			2
balancing security and freedom many legal and security experts see a mixed record for the administration 's efforts to balance security and freedom in a post- 9/11 era			0
there has been criticism over the failure to prevent the leak of sensitive national security information by former @entity310 contractor @entity308 , who disclosed a secret , sweeping government program to gather millions of @entity49 ' phone " metadata " records without their permission or knowledge			0
when discussing his civil rights efforts , @entity7 often mentions his sister - in - law , who in 1963 made history as one of the two black students who integrated the @entity323 under federal armed guard			1
a portrait of a @entity92 prosecutor who stood watch on the university steps that day hangs in @entity7 's personal office in a fifth - floor corner of the @entity92 headquarters -- named for @entity332 , another one of his heroes			2
in a may speech , @entity7 talked about his role as both a defender of justice and a guardian of safety and security -- and how he approached that often - competing challenge			0
" in recent years , thousands of @entity49 , the pride of our nation , have given their lives -- and deal even today with the scars of war -- so that hopeful , striving people who live continents away could proudly hold up their purple fingers after voting in a truly democratic process , " he said			0
" @entity49 is now 50 years from @entity352			0
and we must not countenance , within our own borders , practices that would make it difficult or impossible to exercise the right for which so many have given so much			0

@entity7 served as attorney general for six years
critics are happy to see him go , say he disregarded @entity132
