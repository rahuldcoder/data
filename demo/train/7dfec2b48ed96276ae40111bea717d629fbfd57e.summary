-- genetic screening techniques that allow parents to choose their children 's gender are now more accurate than ever and are becoming increasingly mainstream , but experts are divided over whether the technology should be used in this way			1
a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ( @entity10 ) was originally developed two decades ago to allow embryos to be tested for genetic disease			0
it requires parents to use in vitro fertilization , where eggs are fertilized outside the womb			2
with @entity10 , the embryos are tested for genetic disorders and only those that are free of disease are transferred to the mother 's uterus			2
it means that parents who carry genetic defects can ensure they do n't pass on a genetic illness to their children			1
but @entity10 also can also be used to allow people undergoing in - vitro fertilization to select the gender of the embryo implanted in the mother 's uterus			1
click on the flags above to watch people around the world answer the question , " would you choose your child 's gender ? " using @entity10 for gender selection is banned in most countries , but it is legal in the @entity44 , where the procedure costs around $ 18,000 , including in - vitro fertilization			1
@entity50 fertility expert dr. @entity47 uses @entity10 for gender selection			2
he told @entity0 's @entity54 program that many of his @entity44 clients already have children of one gender and are trying to achieve " family balancing			1
" he added that 70 percent of his patients are from countries where the procedure is banned			0
critics question the ethics of gender selection , and some argue that it could lead to a gender imbalance , particularly in societies with a traditional preference for boys			0
" if anything , there 's a slight preponderance for females , and this is contrary to everything that is publicized , and clearly it varies by country , " said @entity72			0
" @entity79 is strongly in favor of boys , as we would suspect			0
@entity83 , strongly in favor of boys			0
but when you look at the world in general , it 's 50 - 50 " dr. @entity89 , who pioneered @entity10 , he has concerns about its use for non-medical purposes			1
he told @entity0 , " it definitely is an expanded reproductive choice			2
the question is , is it medicine ? is it something that doctors should be involved in ? " but @entity72 argues that it 's wrong to limit scientific capabilities			1
" i say to critics that the last thing in the world that you want to do is put the handcuffs on science			0
" we 've been giving women expanded reproductive choices for 50 years			0
" although the technology for gender selection is becoming more widespread , it remains controversial			2
some feel that it 's " playing @entity119 , " while others welcome having more choice in family planning			0
