-- despite persistent and understandable questions about the cost of college in @entity6 today , the value of a college education is clear			1
but that value is not spread as equitably as it should be across the nation			2
college graduates earn considerably more over the course of their careers than do people with just a high school education , and they are much less likely to be unemployed			1
a study by the @entity16 found the rate of return on a college degree to be approximately 15 % and , contrary to popular wisdom , it was n't just the science and engineering majors who benefited			1
graduates in the liberal arts also saw their degrees pay off			0
the benefits of a college diploma also go well beyond direct financial returns			1
college graduates have lower divorce rates , enjoy healthier lives , have higher rates of health insurance , and much lower rates of incarceration			1
they also have offspring who are more successful in school			0
but the @entity6 is falling behind other developed countries when it comes to educating its citizens , and there is a widening gap between the number of college graduates coming from low - income families versus high - income families			1
in a knowledge - based economy , highly trained workers are key to global competitiveness			0
at current rates , by 2018 the @entity6 will be 3 million college graduates short of what we need to fill expected jobs			1
by 2025 , the shortage will be 16 million			0
the problem is particularly acute among african - americans , latinos , @entity62 and low - income @entity6 of all races and ethnicities			1
students from high - income households are 10 times more likely to attain a college degree than are low - income students			2
the @entity70 will shine a welcome spotlight on this issue thursday with its second summit of university presidents and other higher education leaders			1
we are proud to be representing the @entity77 ( @entity78 ) at this gathering ; alliance members are coming to town with plans that are already being put into action to address this troubling disparity in higher education attainment			1
raising the degree attainment rate for all @entity6 , especially those from minority and low - income backgrounds , is vital to our nation 's economic future			1
universities -- especially public universities -- have a responsibility to find new ways to increase graduation rates for minorities and low - income @entity6 , so we can improve social mobility , narrow income gaps and produce the graduates required to grow the @entity6 economy			1
that is why 11 public research universities , including our institutions , @entity105 and @entity106 , came together to announce the @entity78 in the fall			2
by collaborating instead of competing , we are committed to addressing this problem at scale and sharing strategies that proven to increase college graduation rates			2
the @entity78 's first large - scale initiative focuses on predictive analytics , which involves technology designed to mine student data for early signs that a student may be struggling and then reaching out to that student with additional support tailored to his or her specific needs			0
a great example of the power of this approach comes from @entity106 , where the monitoring of student performance coupled with proactive advising strategies increased semester - to - semester retention rates by 5 % and reduced the time needed to earn degree by almost a half - semester			0
this means 1,200 more students are staying in school every year , and the class of 2014 saved $ 10 million in tuition and fees compared with graduates a year earlier			0
and because now students are graduating more quickly , @entity139 taxpayers will save about $ 5 million in support costs for public education			2
if these same innovations were scaled across the 11 @entity78 institutions over the next five years , we could educate tens of thousands more students while saving almost $ 1.5 billion in educational costs to students and taxpayers			2
that is the kind of transformation higher education needs			1
at @entity105 , the introduction of technology - enhanced advising services has produced dramatic results : the four - year graduation rate at @entity105 increased by nearly 20 percentage points between 2002 and 2010 , with the most dramatic increase occurring after the introduction of a system called @entity160 , which allows students to plot their progress toward a degree in real time			0
@entity105 , like @entity106 , has made investments to boost graduation rates , such as the hiring of hundreds of tutors , the creation of focused learning communities on campus , the introduction of adaptive learning platforms that modify the presentation of educational materials according to a student 's performance on tests , quizzes and other exercises ( this is especially effective in math classes ) and a " retention dashboard " that signals to administrators when a student needs additional support			0
@entity105 's six - year graduation rate stands at 62.5 % , and the goal is to achieve a 75 % rate by 2020			0
but these efforts are not about specific innovations at particular institutions			0
they are about creating opportunities for students and building a stronger society			2
@entity78 members are working together to develop and share solutions that will improve the entire higher education sector , because we believe every individual deserves an opportunity to receive a high - quality and affordable education			1
we know what going it alone can accomplish			0
it 's time to discover what working together can do			0
we believe when universities collaborate , students win .			0
