six decades ago , @entity0 was a teenager living in @entity2 's @entity1			1
as he did most days , @entity0 sat in a field , singing popular songs to himself , enjoying the sunshine and the solitude			0
suddenly , someone came outside to get @entity0 and brought him to the hospital			0
they told him to lie down on an operating table , and then the needle came out			0
" first , they shot me with some kind of medicine			0
it was supposed to deaden the nerves , " he said			0
" then the next thing i heard was snip , snip , and that was it			0
" the doctors did n't tell @entity0 what they were doing , but he knew anyway			0
other boys at the @entity1 had told him how much it hurt to have a vasectomy			0
now it was his turn			0
" when they did ( my right side ) , it seemed like they were pulling my whole insides out , " said @entity0 , now 82 and living in @entity27			0
@entity2 : leader in forced sterilizations @entity0 was one of 20,000 californians forcibly sterilized by the state from 1909 to 1963			1
the goal was to rid society of people thought to be undesirable : people labeled " feeble - minded " or " defectives			1
" " it 's one of the most horrific and shameful chapters in @entity2 's history , " said @entity43 civil rights attorney @entity42			1
thirty - two states had eugenics programs , but @entity2 was in a league of its own			1
the @entity2 sterilized more than twice as many people as the next state , @entity52 , which sterilized 8,300 , according to @entity53 , a professor at @entity55 's @entity54			1
the law said that wards of the state like @entity0 had to be sterilized in order to be discharged from institutions like @entity1 , according to @entity61 , a cultural historian at the @entity62 and author of " @entity64			1
" men and women , boys and girls , were sent to state institutions for all sorts of reasons			0
some had serious developmental disabilities			0
@entity0 ended up at @entity1 because his parents were alcoholics and could n't care for him			0
in the mid- 20th century , the country 's intellectual elite such as doctors , geneticists and @entity79 justices supported forced sterilizations			2
in @entity2 , the eugenics movement was led by figures such as @entity83 , president of @entity85 , and @entity86 , publisher of the @entity87			1
in other states , the sterilization program would stop and start due to legal challenges , but @entity2 's ran strong for more than half a century , @entity61 said			1
" if you were deemed worthy of being sterilized by a doctor , there was no board where you could have a hearing to protest , " he said			2
@entity2 's movement was so effective that in the 1930s , members of the @entity100 party asked @entity2 eugenicists for advice on how to run their own sterilization program			1
" @entity105 used @entity2 's program as its chief example that this was a working , successful policy , " @entity61 said			1
" they modeled their law on @entity2 's law			1
" " it kills my last name " in 2003 , then - gov. @entity113 apologized for the forced sterilizations , but @entity0 wants compensation for not be able to have children of his own			2
" what really ticks me off is , it kills my last name , " @entity0 said			0
" if i should die tomorrow , everything 's died			2
" over the past few years , a friend of @entity0 's has tried to help him seek justice			2
@entity122 , a nursing student , has written letters and e-mails on @entity0 's behalf to gov. @entity126 and other state politicians and officials			2
he has not succeeded in getting any of them to speak with him			0
@entity122 keeps a file of the e-mails he 's sent to politicians and the form letters he 's received in return			2
" i hate to sound so cynical , but i think they 're just waiting for the victims to die and forget this whole thing ever happened , " @entity122 said			2
" there 's nothing more to add " @entity141 's attempts to contact politicians have been unsuccessful			2
the governor 's office referred @entity141 to the state @entity145 , which sent a two - sentence statement : " @entity148 of @entity2 deeply regrets the harm caused to victims of involuntary sterilization that occurred through the first half of the 1900s			1
this was a sad and painful period in @entity2 's history , one that should never be repeated			1
" when @entity141 asked @entity126 for his stance on reparations for sterilization victims , press secretary @entity159 sent an e-mail referring to the statement			2
" there 's nothing more to add , " he wrote			2
@entity141 also sent e-mails and made phone calls to the office of @entity170 , speaker of the @entity171			0
when no response was received , @entity141 visited his office in @entity174			0
his spokesman , @entity175 , said the speaker was tied up in meetings			0
" this is an issue i personally am just learning about and looking into , " @entity175 said			0
@entity2 's response to victims stands in stark contrast to @entity182 's			1
@entity182 task force recommends $ 50,000 for sterilization victims in that state , gov. @entity185 has sought out victims and held hearings where she apologized personally and heard their stories			1
she also set up a task force to help the victims and recommended that each receive $ 50,000 in reparations			0
" that 's not happening in @entity2 , " said @entity42 , the civil rights attorney			1
" to think that we 're behind on this issue instead of leading on this issue is very troublesome			0
" " @entity2 has not done right " @entity196 is the former @entity2 state senator who wrote the 1979 legislation outlawing sterilization			1
he said he 's not surprised politicians are reticent on the subject			0
" i would venture to say most people in this legislature -- and most people in @entity2 -- are n't even aware there was a eugenics movement in @entity2 , " @entity196 said			1
californians , he added , need to face their history and at least hold hearings and invite victims to tell their stories			1
" @entity2 has not done right by these victims , " @entity196 said			1
" but i think @entity2 and @entity2 need to be aware of their history			1

@entity2 forcibly sterilized 20,000 people from 1909 to 1963
the goal was to rid society of people labeled " feeble - minded " or " defectives "
@entity2 's response to victims stands in stark contrast to @entity182 's
