-- a recent pair of racially charged political incidents in the @entity3 illustrate the pitfalls -- and potential benefits -- that await the national @entity7 leadership if it makes good on an oft - repeated pledge to woo black voters away from the @entity10			1
in @entity13 , @entity7 candidate for @entity12 recently made national news when unknown vandals destroyed one of her campaign signs by spray - painting her face white -- a reference to the ugly , warped idea that black candidates who run on the @entity7 line are outcasts from the black community who are " acting white			1
" in @entity26 , the bitter endgame of the recent @entity7 runoff between incumbent sen. @entity29 and tea party challenger @entity30 included a telephone press conference held by @entity29 's aides that was interrupted by an anonymous caller insistently asking : " if black people were harvesting cotton , why is it ok to harvest their votes ? " it was a sign of the rage expressed by @entity30 that @entity29 's razor - close 1.6 % win was made possible by an unusual last - minute appeal to @entity10 black voters , who crossed party lines to supply the margin of victory			1
@entity29 's victory is expected to hold up despite a long - shot legal challenge by @entity30			0
and @entity50 is soldiering on toward her august 26 primary , after which she faces an uphill battle against longtime incumbent rep. @entity53 ( disclosure : @entity50 's family and mine have been close for years )			0
the rough and tumble of @entity3 primary politics is nothing new , but the candidates should n't have to weather these recent attacks on their own			2
now would be a perfect time for national party brass and congressional leaders to prove they believe their own rhetoric about @entity7 outreach to black voters			1
a committed , earnest effort would be good for the party , for black communities and for the nation			0
at present , @entity7 are on a collision course with diversity that will , without a course correction , spell long - term disaster for the party			1
in 2012 , @entity7 presidential candidate @entity78 got only 17 % of nonwhite voters , and polls show only 2 % of @entity7 are black and 6 % are @entity81			1
republicans ca n't allow those trends to continue in a nation where the nonwhite population is currently 35 % and expected to reach 57 % by 2060			1
@entity87 chairman @entity86 has taken steps to broaden the party 's base : after the @entity78 loss , he committed $ 10 million in party funds to hire organizers tasked with building support in black , @entity81 and @entity96 communities			2
that 's a good start			0
even better would be to funnel support -- money , " ground troops , " advertising support and high - profile endorsements -- to candidates like @entity50 when they are in the thick of battle			2
even in an uphill battle like the challenge in @entity13 's @entity108 , the party must support black candidates who step forward and endure abuse for running as @entity7			1
opinion : what @entity7 can learn from @entity29 's use of blacks to win @entity50 's not alone			2
this year , the fact that 11 black republicans are running for office -- a record high number -- should be a major point of pride for the national party , and a high priority for when directing resources			0
ditto for the fact that sen. @entity125 of @entity126 is an odds - on favorite to make history this year : if elected to a full term in november , @entity125 -- who was appointed in 2012 to finish out retiring @entity133 's term -- will become the state 's first elected black @entity7 senator			1
black voters have been solidly @entity10 voters since the 1960s , but some black voters gravitate toward @entity7 positions on bread - and - butter issues like support for charter schools and pro-growth economic policies			1
and many black church - goers find the @entity7 a comfortable political home for their culturally conservative views on school prayer , abortion and same - sex marriage			2
if @entity7 are smart , they 'll continue to build on those points of agreement			0
even smarter would be to seize the opportunity presented by @entity29 's gambit in @entity26			0
having relied on black voters to rescue his candidacy , @entity29 is now expected to return the favor by fighting against restrictive voter id laws and by steering federal financial support to black colleges and universities			0
both measures make sense in the state that is the poorest in the nation and has the largest percentage of blacks			0
if @entity29 holds up his end of the deal , @entity7 might have a road map for ways to broaden their appeal as the 2016 presidential election approaches			0
in this climate of political polarization , the key to the political center lies with candidates and political parties with the nerve and creativity to form broad coalitions that cross traditional boundaries			1
@entity3 black voters and candidates are showing they are ready to make that kind of deal			0
here 's hoping party leaders take them up on the offer .			0

if @entity7 do n't get more minority support , it will spell *future* disaster
@entity7 must support black candidates who endure abuse for being @entity7
@entity7 must keep promises to nonwhites : they are 35 % of the population
@entity7 should form broad coalitions that cross traditional boundaries
