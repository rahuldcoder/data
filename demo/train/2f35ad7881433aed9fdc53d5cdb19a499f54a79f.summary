-- the pop culture babies are coming ! baby naming website @entity2 has made predictions of what the most popular baby names of 2012 will be based on an analysis of almost 3 million page views on their site			1
the guesses are an eye - opening , pop culture revelation of what is hitting with soon - to - be parents			2
highlights below : rue taking the top spot is a beloved " @entity18 " female name , but it 's not the obvious one			1
@entity21 , the doe - eyed heroine who stole our hearts ( i throw berries at you , @entity27 ! ) leads @entity2 's list , according to their statistics			0
if a " @entity18 " character had to take the cake , i 'm glad it 's @entity21			1
can you imagine teaching a youngin ' to say @entity36 ? @entity37 heading over to the @entity39 chromosome , @entity37 takes the cake , flanked by other boys ' names ending in -- ett , like @entity44 and @entity45			1
as the the only reference the list makes to " @entity48 , " i ca n't help but wonder if the fifth ranked @entity49 of the world feel threatened ... @entity51 and @entity52 we head over to musical ground as the middle half of @entity56 makes an appearance ( somewhere @entity58 and @entity59 are thinking : " curses ! why did n't we trademark this name for everyone ! " ) , along with current @entity0 cover star @entity52			2
if two musical nombres had to make the cut , i 'm glad it 's these two			0
i do n't need to see any little @entity68 's running around			0
grayson though i wish that @entity70 had squeezed its way in , i 'm tickled to see a reference to this season 's guiltiest pleasure beginning to make a dent			0
" @entity69 " - related or not , this world could use a few more @entity69 lookalikes			0
@entity79 yes , the site lists @entity79 's appearance as a favorite among ambitious parents with studiously high hopes for their offspring , but i 'm choosing to interpret this name as an homage to @entity88 , the reigning " @entity90 " bite - sized bada * *			1
@entity91 in a puzzling change of pace , the terrorizing and brutal @entity91 of the " @entity18 " has made its way up the ranks in what i can only surmise is that parents - to - be want their children to be built of inordinate strength and spout irrational and violent temper tantrums			1
can you imagine the backlash of putting a @entity91 in a timeout ? pregnant or not , what are your thoughts on these names ? do you mimic my surprise that @entity109 did n't appear ? and where is the love for @entity112 ? ! see the full article at @entity0			2
