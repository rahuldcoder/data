-- the @entity1 and its allies are angrier at @entity3 now over @entity4 , but will they do anything more about it -- especially @entity8 ? in solemn procession , wooden caskets carrying the remains of those killed in the downing of @entity13 17 over eastern @entity4 -- the majority of the dead were @entity18 citizens -- have been arriving in the @entity18			1
in all , the nearly 300 victims hailed from more than 10 countries , leaving nations mourning and politicians debating how to deal with @entity23 , whose ties with the @entity4 rebels suspected of downing the jet on july 17 are being cast in the most negative light			0
the tragedy has stirred @entity8 officials to look at new action against a country that is crucial to their economies			2
what 's the layout on sanctions ? on july 16 , the @entity1 imposed its harshest sanctions yet on @entity3 over its annexation of @entity40 , and what the @entity42 administration said was @entity3 's failure to end the @entity4 conflict			1
president @entity42 expanded steps in targeting two banks , @entity47 and @entity48 ; and two energy companies , @entity50 and @entity51			0
they wo n't be able to get important financing in the @entity1			2
in addition , the administration froze any @entity1 assets and prohibited @entity1 business contacts for eight @entity3 arms companies that make weapons , including small arms , mortars and surface - to - air missiles			1
one is the @entity63 , maker of the @entity64 and other arms			0
earlier this year , the @entity1 and @entity8 imposed a more limited range of sanctions in response to @entity3 's annexation of @entity40 and the massing of troops along its eastern border with @entity4			1
those included asset freezes and travel bans			0
what 's changed since then ? @entity77 was blown out of the sky			0
@entity1 officials believe @entity3 armed the @entity81 rebels in eastern @entity4 with the rocket system suspected of shooting down the jetliner on july 17			1
@entity84 , they now say it 's likely the rebels did n't know it was a commercial plane at more than 30,000 feet			0
@entity3 leaders deny any responsibility -- even indirectly -- and are pointing fingers at @entity4 and @entity91 for stirring up trouble in the region			1
it 's only upped the ante regarding @entity3 and its relationship with the @entity1 and its @entity8 allies			1
aside from the general allied approach to @entity4 , there is more pressure than ever now on @entity8 to take tougher action because so many of the @entity77 passengers were from there , and emotions are fever pitch			2
why has n't @entity8 acted that forcefully ? earlier this year , @entity8 joined the @entity1 in imposing limited sanctions in response to @entity3 ' actions in @entity40 and eastern @entity4			1
those sanctions included asset freezes and travel bans			0
the @entity1 response is tougher but it does n't do a ton of business with @entity3			1
@entity8 on the other hand does			2
experts said @entity8 imports nearly 30 % of its energy from @entity3 , raising the specter of rolling blackouts and unheated homes in the region next winter should @entity3 decide to retaliate for tougher sanctions			1
@entity126 's place as a regional financial hub is highly dependent on @entity3 capital			1
@entity129 has already signed off on a deal to deliver two warships to @entity3 , according to experts			2
oil giant @entity133 , which has its headquarters in @entity135 , is the largest corporation in the @entity18 and has huge investments in @entity3			2
remember the @entity77 victims and the @entity18			0
but ... " so the @entity8 have over the last decade , as @entity3 has grown as an oil country , gotten themselves so intermeshed that it 's very tough for them to do it , " said @entity0 's @entity138 , referring to tougher sanctions			1
but is n't the pressure really on now ? yes			0
the @entity145 's 28 member states displayed a little more resolve on thursday			1
@entity145 ambassadors said they were considering targeting banks vital to @entity3 's economy , including access to capital markets , defense and technologies such as the energy sector			1
@entity155 , a senior fellow for international economics with the @entity157 , said sanctions are only effective if widely backed by @entity160 nations			0
@entity1 sanctions alone have teeth but similar action by @entity8 allies would apply real pain			1
" we 're really at an early inning of the sanctions , " @entity155 said			0
ok , so what 's next ? it 's really not clear if widespread anger at @entity23 will ultimately force new action to isolate @entity3 further			2
the @entity145 ambassadors continue to meet on the subject and there is no indication they will abandon caution at the very least			2
" there are a lot of economic interests that would be affected by a comprehensive breakdown in relations , " @entity155 said			0
map : @entity8 's thirst for @entity3 gas but the end , some experts believe @entity8 is unlikely to take a tougher line			1
" i honestly think the @entity8 have no spine , " said @entity189 professor @entity188 , an economic sociologist			2
" it 's amazing to me on a moral level			0
how bad should it get ? as a human being , i do n't quite grasp that			0
this seems to be as bad as it can get			0
" but if they acted , what would be the toughest step ? let 's start with the current sanctions overall			0
@entity155 predicted that by fall , those will begin targeting specific sectors of @entity3 's economy -- the eighth - largest in the world , with gdp of more than $ 2 trillion			1
" it 's going to take some time for the accumulated effects of all of this to really be felt by the @entity3 people , " he said			1
real pain for @entity3 would come from any sanctions aimed at cutting off an entire part of its economy , such as defense , energy or finance , according to experts			2
@entity155 said the @entity1 took a first step in this direction last week by adding important @entity3 banks and energy companies to its list			1
" i think the most realistic goal is what @entity42 was articulating early on : to change the calculus , " @entity188 said			0
" it does n't even have to be the damage that is done			0
it has to be a credible threat that damage can be done			0
the @entity3 economy is not that strong ... it may not take much to sort of spin out of control			0
" who are @entity4 's @entity241 rebels ? sanctions : top 10 @entity3 targets opinion : @entity8 must increase sanctions on @entity3			1

@entity8 leaders *discuss* further sanctions against @entity3 after downing of @entity249
the day before the crash , the @entity1 *escalated* its sanctions on @entity3 's financial sector
this week , the @entity145 said it was adding more people and entities to its sanctions list
