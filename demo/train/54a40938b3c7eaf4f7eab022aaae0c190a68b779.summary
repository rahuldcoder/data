@entity0 -- the battle for control of @entity4 is entering a final , frantic five - day stretch that favors republicans but has room for plenty of surprises that could determine which party will run the @entity11			1
the unsettled nature of so many individual contests at this late stage underscores the unpredictability of this election season			1
and @entity17 could turn out to be a nail - biter that continues for days -- or even months			1
the themes that were expected to dominate this election cycle -- obamacare and immigration -- are turning out to be duds			1
meanwhile , threats posed by @entity25 and @entity26 -- hardly dinner table conversations a year ago -- are suddenly top issues			2
and on top of all that , add a mix of 2016 presidential drama as potential contenders barnstorm early voting states to help congressional candidates			2
the @entity36 is poised to extend its grip on the @entity38 and needs a net gain of six seats to take back the @entity11 for the first time since 2007			1
republicans are expected to easily take @entity43 seats in @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , leaving them needing just three more seats to build a @entity11 majority			1
but getting there could get tricky			2
@entity52 @entity43 sen. @entity51 is holding firm in a race many observers thought she would have lost by now , up four points in an @entity58 survey over her challenger , @entity59			2
in @entity60 , @entity43 believe that @entity64 â € ” one of the emerging stars of this election cycle â € ” could beat @entity36 @entity65			1
if neither candidate gets 50 percent of the vote a run - off election will take place in january			2
in @entity71 , senator @entity70 is still slugging it out against independent candidate @entity73 and even the man most likely to become majority leader in a @entity36 @entity11 , @entity75 , can not take re-election for granted in @entity77			1
the loss of any of that trio would complicate @entity36 hopes in the @entity11			1
still , there are other pickup opportunities for @entity36			2
in @entity84 , @entity43 sen. @entity83 seemed to be in good shape just a few months ago			0
but now he 's down by seven points to @entity36 challenger @entity87 in a thursday @entity89 survey			0
the @entity90 had the race closer â € ” with @entity87 up two percent			0
in @entity93 , @entity43 sen. @entity92 is in a very tight race with former @entity96 sen. @entity95			0
meanwhile , @entity100 @entity43 sen. @entity99 , fighting an uphill battle in an increasingly red state , was down between 13 and seven points to challenger @entity102 in two recent surveys			1
other key states where @entity36 have a good chance of picking up seats include @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			0
though the 2014 race is n't even wrapped up yet , the next election in 2016 is already unfolding as potential presidential candidates stump in key early voting states			1
@entity115 gov. @entity114 announced plans to blitz 19 states before @entity17 , including @entity109 , @entity93 and @entity118 , which will play outsized roles in the presidential campaign			0
@entity121 , meanwhile , made waves by jabbing @entity123 over her attitude towards business			0
on the @entity43 side , @entity126 , who increasingly appears to be waging an undeclared presidential campaign , tracked through @entity109 this week -- the state that did most to doom her 2008 @entity38 bid			0
@entity132 remained a sideshow , with his low approval rating making him unwanted by @entity43 in swing states			0
so , he has been largely confined to raising millions of dollars for @entity43 coffers , or stumping for candidates in liberal territory			0
on thursday , @entity132 was headed to @entity139 , @entity140 , to campaign for rep. @entity141 who is seeking to unseat @entity36 incumbent @entity142 in a tight governor 's race			0
@entity1 's @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this story			0

the battle for the @entity11 is unsettled heading into the final days of campaigning
themes that were expected to dominate the cycle have n't *resonated*
