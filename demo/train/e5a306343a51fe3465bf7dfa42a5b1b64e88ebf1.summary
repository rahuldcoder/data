-- i have a dog named @entity3			2
she is a small beige cockapoo who barks at the mailman			0
i would not trust @entity7 to watch her			1
i also would not trust @entity7 to take my car in for a tire change			1
i would not trust @entity7 to deposit my @entity13 's @entity12 check			1
i would n't trust him to clean my bowling ball , shop for a @entity17 ham , change a twenty for two tens , tell me the time or recite the proper lyrics to @entity22 's " no rain			2
" this is not because i am a particularly untrusting person			0
no , it 's because i think @entity7 is slime			1
in case you missed the news , two days ago @entity29 held a press conference to announce that @entity7 , undeniably one of the nation 's elite football minds , had agreed to a four - year , $ 850,000 per year deal to take over the @entity34			1
with nearly 400 giddy sports fanatics in attendance , @entity7 , standing alongside @entity37 , the school 's athletic director , spoke of honor and loyalty and love and redemption			1
the ensuing press release , issued by @entity29 's sports information department , was straight out of @entity45 : 101			1
it made @entity7 sound like a cross between @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 ; @entity52 's gift to young men seeking to better themselves			2
@entity7 fired as @entity55 head football coach what it failed to mention — and what the school desperately wants everyone to fail to mention — is that @entity7 may well be the least ethically whole man in the , ahem , ethically whole - deprived world of @entity63 collegiate sports			1
why , it was only seven months ago that @entity7 , at the time the @entity55 ' head coach , was riding his motorcycle when he crashed along @entity67 , @entity68			1
when asked by school officials to explain what had happened , he failed to mention that , eh , also on the bike was @entity72 , a 26 - year - old former @entity73 volleyball player who worked as the student - athlete development coordinator for the football program			2
it turned out that @entity7 , a married father of four , was not only having an affair with @entity78 ( who was engaged at the time ) , but was a key voice on the board that hired her for the position when she was n't even remotely qualified			1
during an ensuing university investigation , it was determined that @entity7 made a previously undisclosed $ 20,000 cash gift to @entity78 as a @entity17 present			2
to his credit , @entity88 , the school 's athletic director , defied the wishes of every pigskin - blinded @entity73 fan and fired @entity7			1
in a statement , he rightly wrote that , " all of these facts , individually and collectively , are clearly contrary to character and responsibilities of the person occupying the position of the head football coach — an individual who should serve as a role model and a leader for our student - athlete			1
" now , ethics and morals and character be damned , @entity7 has returned , spewing off nonsense about second chances ( ever notice how garbage men and bus drivers rarely get the second chances we are all — according to fallen athletic figures — rightly afforded as @entity117 ? ) and learning from mistakes and making things right			2
@entity29 , a school with mediocre athletics and apparently , sub-mediocre standards , has turned to a person who lied to his last employer about the nature of an accident involving the mistress he allegedly hired to a university position she was unqualified to hold			2
please , if you must , take a second to read that again			0
@entity7 , holder of a ph.d. in the @entity133 ( he also ditched the @entity134 shortly after signing a long - term extension in 2007 , and quit as coach of the @entity138 13 game into his first season later that year			1
he informed his players via a note atop their lockers ) , will be the one charged with teaching the 17 - and 18 - year - old boys who decide to come to @entity144 about not merely football , but life			1
he will be their guide			0
@entity7 and social media prove a bad mix sadly , in the world of @entity63 sports , such is far from surprising			1
this has been a year unlike any other ; one where the virtues of greed and the color of green do n't merely cloak big - time college athletics , but control them			1
in case you have n't noticed , we are in the midst of a dizzying , nauseating game of @entity167 , where colleges and universities — once determined to maintain geographic rivals in order to limit student travel — have lost their collective minds			0
the @entity174 , a charter member of the @entity176 , is headed for the @entity177			0
the @entity178 — formerly a power conference featuring the likes of @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 's and @entity184 — has added @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190			0
@entity191 moved from the @entity192 to the @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity196 @entity195 went to @entity197 , the @entity198 — a member of the @entity192 for approximately 27 minutes — joined the @entity200			0
which , to be honest , i did n't even know existed			0
rest assured , none of these moves ( literally , nary a one ) were conducted with the best interests of so - called student - athletes in mind			0
new conferences tend to offer increased payouts , increased merchandising opportunities , increased exposure and increased opportunities to build a new stadium — one with 80,000 seats , 100 luxury boxes , $ 20 million naming rights , $ 9 hot dogs and the perfect spot for @entity219 to broadcast its @entity221 pregame show			0
why , within 24 hours of quarterback @entity223 winning the @entity224 , @entity222 was hawking @entity224 t - shirts for $ 24 on its website ( or , for a mere $ 54.98 , one can purchase his no. 2 jersey )			0
percentage of the dough that winds up in @entity223 's pocket ? zero			0
after another spectacular exit , @entity7 eyes football return that , really , is the rub of it all ; of @entity7 's crabgrass - like revival ; of coaches bounding from one job for another ( even as players can only do so after sitting out a year ) ; of @entity239 moving west and @entity186 moving east and athletic department officials moving on up ( to a penthouse apartment in the sky ) ; of $ 54.98 jerseys			1
it 's the athletes ultimately getting screwed			0
sure , for the 0.5 % of @entity63 football players who wind up in the @entity251 , the deal is a sweet one			2
the other 99.5 % , however , are mere pawns , sold a dizzying narrative of glory and fame and lifelong achievement , but , more often than not , left uneducated , unfulfilled and physically battered			0
they are told a coach will be with them for four years — then watch as said figure takes a $ 2 million gig elsewhere but , hey , only because it was right for him and his family			0
they are told they will receive a great education , then find themselves stuck on a six - hour flight from @entity268 to @entity269 , @entity270			0
they are told that these will be the greatest years of their life , that the college experience is a special one , that only the highest of standards exist			0
then they meet their new coach : @entity7			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity282 .			2

@entity7 was named the new football coach at @entity29 this week
hiring came just months after he was fired from @entity68 amid *scandal*
@entity282 says , sadly , this is no surprise in big - time college sports
he says the vast *majority* of players are ultimately hurt by the behavior of coaches and *administrators*
