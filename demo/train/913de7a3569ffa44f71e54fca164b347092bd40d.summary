( @entity0 ) -- if you take a multivitamin every morning and perhaps a supplement or two because you care about your health , does it make sense to do the same with your dog or cat ? @entity13 of @entity14 , @entity15 , would say yes			2
the pet supplement market has grown into a $ 1.3 billion business			1
@entity13 caught on to pet supplements a few years ago when she noticed that her 13 - year - old cat , @entity20 , was n't up to her usual antics			1
" she was having a hard time jumping up on the counter , and she was n't playing as much as she used to , " @entity13 says			2
" finally , she just spent less time up there , i think , because it was painful for her			0
" @entity13 researched @entity20 's problem online , and learned about the joint supplements glucosamine and chondroitin			2
she asked her veterinarian , and they agreed to give the cat a product that combines both joint supplements			2
" @entity20 is jumping all over the place again , " @entity13 says			0
now , @entity13 is a believer in pet supplements			1
she gives @entity20 and her other cat , 2 - year - old @entity39 , a multivitamin , probiotics to help their immune systems and essential fatty acids for skin and coat health			2

demand for supplements is on the rise			2
the pet supplement market has grown about 15 percent annually since 2000 and is now a $ 1.3 billion business , according to the @entity54			1
@entity55 says approximately 17 percent of pet owners give their cats and dogs some type of supplement			1
a pet supplement is a product that is intended to complement the diet and help support and maintain a normal biological function			1
products range from multivitamins for overall health to targeted formulas that claim to alleviate joint problems or canine cognitive dysfunction			2
dr. @entity70 , a veterinarian at @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , started using supplements in 1992			2
he was wary at first because he did n't learn about them in veterinary school , and there were n't many on the market			1
but when an old professor of his recommended a joint supplement for one of @entity70 's patients , he took notice			0
@entity70 's golden retriever @entity85 had an arthritic shoulder , so he also tried a joint supplement on her			0
" she could barely make it up and down the stairs , but within a week after the supplement she was running and catching frisbees in the yard , " @entity70 says			0
" that sold me on that product			0
" he said his patients have had good success with joint supplements and he prescribes them all the time			0
but some substances , such as @entity99 , may not be suitable for pets , according to the @entity101 , and their safety and effectiveness is untested in animals			1
what 's more , some supplements have been found to contain lesser amounts of an active ingredient than the manufacturer claims , or substances like lead have been detected			0
dr. @entity112 is president of @entity113 , which independently tests supplements for humans and animals			1
in the past few years , his company has reviewed roughly a dozen multivitamins , joint supplements and fish oils for pets and found that about half of the products tested do n't pass			1
" we have repeatedly found the quality of supplements for pets to be worse overall than for supplements for people , " @entity112 says			1
with the pet supplement market burgeoning , especially online , the @entity101 urges pet owners to talk to their veterinarians before giving supplements to their animals , something @entity70 agrees with			1
" people need to be careful about self - medicating , " he says			0
" i 've seen many animals harmed by people getting the wrong information over the @entity141			0
" dr. @entity142 , professor of clinical nutrition at @entity144 's @entity143 , offers four factors to consider when evaluating supplements : 1			0
product quality how much of the functional , active ingredient is in the product ? responsible manufacturers will have 800 numbers on the package to call with technical questions about the ingredients , and your veterinarian should know what specific questions to ask			0
efficacy is there any scientific basis to support the use of this supplement ? if information about product testing is n't available on the company 's web site or elsewhere , call the company for details about the studies that have been performed			1
check the list of ingredients carefully before giving a supplement to your pet			1
for example , a supplement might include lactose , which some cats and dogs ca n't tolerate			1
it 's a good idea to consult your veterinarian first to discuss how the supplements may react with any medications the pet is taking			1
a product 's safety should be proven			0
for example , the company might state in its literature that it was tested in high doses on mice and found to be safe , or the number of adverse events reported might be few to none			0

pet supplement market has grown 15 percent per year since 2000
@entity101 does not test supplements on animals
