-- when people talk about the cinematic geniuses of the 1980s , one name invariably comes up -- @entity4			2
for young people growing up then and even today , the writer - director 's name conjures up memories of unforgettable films			1
from " @entity15 " ( 1984 ) and " @entity16 " ( 1985 ) to " pretty in @entity17 " ( 1986 ) and " @entity18 " ( 1986 ) , @entity4 was responsible for a series of films that openly and honestly explored the exhilaration and tumultuousness of adolescence			2
it 's been nearly three decades since those movies arrived in theaters , but audiences still watch and enjoy them as if they were made yesterday			2
however , despite the love audiences have shown for his work , @entity4 was never nominated for an @entity26			1
@entity4 is n't alone in being an outstanding filmmaker whose features about people under 30 were overlooked during awards season			2
it 's unfortunate but undeniable that award shows -- and the @entity26 in particular -- have a history of ignoring great movies made for and about young people			1
in 2013 alone , several such films received raves from critics , earning spots on " best of " lists			2
" @entity45 " and " @entity46 " scored approval ratings of 76 % and 85 % of critics , respectively , on @entity42 , while " @entity44 , " written by the duo behind 2009 's underappreciated " ( 500 ) @entity49 , " earned the approval of 92 % of critics			0
" @entity53 " received a 99 % approval on @entity42 , a higher ranking than any of this year 's best picture nominees			1
" @entity58 , " starring @entity59 and @entity60 , may have divided some moviegoers , but the film was also lauded for its provocative depiction of disaffected youth			0
and it 's not for nothing that " @entity63 : catching @entity65 " was the top grossing film of 2013			1
yet not one of these movies earned a single @entity26 nomination			1
meanwhile , " @entity69 of @entity70 -- which secured a 77 % approval rating on @entity42 -- received five @entity26 nods , including ones for best picture and best adapted screenplay			1
2014 @entity26 nominees list that 's not to say that " @entity79 " did n't deserve recognition , but these other movies focused on characters in the early stages of adulthood			1
from three teenage boys running away from home to build a house in " @entity45 " to a couple in their 20s managing a treatment facility for troubled children in " @entity53 , " these films were about young people finding their way -- a seeming disadvantage in the academy 's eyes			1
in an e-mail interview , @entity97 , a professor of cinema studies at @entity100 's @entity99 , noted that " @entity102 associates youth with escapist entertainment			0
( there ) is the assumption here ( no doubt , a biased one ) that to be important , a theme has to be adult and mature , and youth films just do n't make it			0
" over the years , there have been some exceptions to this rule			0
for example , " @entity119 " ( 1955 ) received three @entity26 nominations , and " @entity118 " ( 1973 ) grabbed five nods -- though both films ultimately walked away empty - handed			1
" juno , " the 2007 comedy about a pregnant high schooler ( @entity123 ) , was nominated for four @entity26 , including best picture and best director			1
the film took home the award for best original screenplay -- a win that one could argue had more to do with the quirkiness of @entity133 's script than the subject matter itself			0
film critic @entity136 ( the @entity137 ) also observed that " @entity26 voters skew older			1
" " they are more interested in stories about grown - ups and more likely to have relationships with actors and filmmakers who are 30 and older , " @entity136 said via e-mail			0
that may be part of the reason why movies such as " @entity150 , " which delighted critics with one of 2012 's best scripts and stellar performances from @entity155 and @entity156 -- also did n't receive any recognition from the academy			0
such snubs seem particularly egregious , partly because the academy often blatantly attempts to appeal to a younger demographic			0
in 2011 , the @entity26 chose @entity59 and @entity162 as hosts in hopes of attracting younger viewers			2
the plan failed , with the ratings dipping and the duo receiving poor reviews			0
the intention may have been a noble one , but perhaps a better idea would have been for the academy to begin honoring movies that speak to what it 's like to be a young person today			2
" @entity181 , " a song performed by @entity183 on " @entity45 " soundtrack , speaks of the transition between adolescence and adulthood			0
it includes the following lyrics : the youth is starting to change			0
are you starting to change ?			0

the @entity26 tend to overlook movies about young people
films such as " @entity63 : catching fire " and " @entity53 " were snubbed
some of these movies brought in more money or accolades than many @entity26 nominees
