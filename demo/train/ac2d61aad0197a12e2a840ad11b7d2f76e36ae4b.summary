-- @entity1 still can remember the smell			2
it was an awful , metallic stench , the odor of burning steel , that filled the @entity7 team bus as it pulled across the @entity8 on september 12 , 2001			1
the players , returning from a trip to @entity12 in the only way they could after a nationwide air traffic shutdown , crowded to the right side of the bus			2
they saw that black cloud over lower @entity17 where the @entity18 had stood , and in an instant understood the pain and fear that had gripped their city			2
" i remember wondering , ' what do we do with the group ? ' " said @entity23 , their manager at the time			2
" if we were going to just be a @entity29 over this gaping wound or were we going to actually make a difference ? " the answer , in so many ways , was the latter			2
the immediate reaction after the 9/11 attacks was to dismiss sports as unimportant , to postpone the games as the nation came to grips with what happened			1
everyone agreed that was the right decision			1
but soon after , the games people love became an integral part of the healing process for the @entity48 region			1
the athletes , some with absolutely no ties to the city but a uniform , became a source of inspiration			2
they went to ground zero to meet with the men and women working night and day to clean up			1
they lifted boxes of relief supplies off trucks , many times in stadium parking lots that had become staging areas			0
they wore caps and uniform patches to honor the firefighters and police officers who lost their lives trying to save others as the @entity18 fell			0
former @entity74 quarterback @entity73 remembers going to ground zero a few days after the towers fell , passing the soldiers with machine guns at their sides to shake hands with the rescue workers			0
" it was a little frightening to be down there , walking around , not knowing what was going to happen , " @entity73 said this week , " and not knowing what you were going to see			0
" then , at a time when many wondered if it was right -- or even safe -- to gather and cheer for something as trivial as a baseball game , they helped everyone realize it was ok to be normal again			1
" it almost felt defiant , " said @entity1 , then an infielder for the @entity7			1
" it was like @entity48 saying to the world , ' we 're going to be ok			0
you can hit us , but you ca n't keep us down			0
' " it is only fitting , then , that the biggest ceremonies commemorating the 9/11 attacks will take place in @entity103 stadiums			1
it will begin in @entity105 , @entity106 , where fans of the two cities most affected by the attacks -- @entity48 and @entity110 -- will gather to watch the @entity111 play the @entity112			0
it will continue sunday night at @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 , where 80,000 fans will receive a small @entity119 flag upon entering the stadium for the @entity74 - @entity122 game			1
bagpipers from @entity48 police and fire departments will perform " @entity128 " and @entity126 will sing the national anthem			0
then , the focus will shift to the games , which is what happened in a cathartic way after 9/11			1
" i felt like , if anything , we gave people a break from what was going on , " said @entity133 , the @entity111 quarterback at the time			1
@entity133 would give $ 275,000 to 9/11 charities in the weeks that followed and develop a bond with a firehouse in @entity144			1
" it was , ' hey , we can watch the @entity111			0
the @entity111 are on , ' " he said			0
" i felt pressure to win in @entity147 that next weekend , but more important was playing in a way that would make people proud			1
that we won the game was an added bonus			1
it was nice to know that , on some level , we had a positive influence on the events that were going on			0
nowhere was the influence greater than with the @entity7 , who played the first major sporting event in the city after the attacks on september 21 , 2001			1
@entity161 , a relief pitcher with the team and a @entity48 native , remembers how different things felt when he arrived at @entity165 that day			0
the debate about whether the games should resume had raged in the city for four days			1
" just coming to the ballpark that day , you were n't sure if it was the right thing to do , " @entity161 said			0
" soon as you pulled into the players ' lot you had the bomb squad out there with the dogs and the mirrors looking under the car			0
" the @entity180 were in town , and for one night , the bitter @entity183 rivals became willing participants in something bigger than a pennant race			2
@entity187 sang the national anthem			0
then - mayor @entity189 , a lifelong @entity190 fan , was honored before the game and received a standing ovation			1
@entity193 , the @entity180 star , admitted he was " scared to death			0
" if the terrorists wanted to strike again , was there a better target than a major - league ballpark filled with people ? the early innings were a blur , @entity1 said , a somber night until the seventh inning stretch			1
@entity203 performed " @entity214 , " and while there was some uncertainty in the crowd about how to respond to such a celebratory song , that changed when firefighters and cops joined her in a high - stepping dance like burly @entity213			2
the @entity180 took the lead in the top of the eighth			0
@entity218 , the @entity7 star catcher , came to the plate in the bottom of the inning , and on an 0 - 1 count , hit a towering home run to center field to give the @entity7 a 3 - 2 lead they never relinquished			1
the crowd responded with cheers , some tears , and then this : " @entity119 ! @entity119 ! @entity119 ! " watch @entity218 's dramatic home run when @entity165 closed seven years later , it had seen 5,791 home runs			1
" it was almost like a blur to me , it was almost like a dream , sort of surreal , " @entity218 said at the time			0
" i 'm just so happy i gave the people something to cheer			2
there was a lot of emotion			0
it was just a surreal sort of energy out there			0
i 'm just so proud to be a part of it tonight			2
" later that fall the @entity190 would make provide more dramatic relief to the city in their run to the @entity252 , where they lost game 7 in the ninth inning to the @entity256			2
@entity218 will be part of the remembrance events at before the @entity7 - @entity260 game at the @entity7 new stadium , @entity262 on sunday night , catching a ceremonial first pitch from @entity161 before the @entity7 take the field			1
everyone in the stadium will pause to remember			0
then , just as they did 10 years ago , they 'll play ball .			0

the @entity7 first post- 9/11 home game was on september 21 , 2001
at first , the decision was made to " postpone the games as the nation came to grips "
but , author says , " the games people love became an integral part of the healing process "
that night @entity7 won , crowd honored @entity282 , @entity284 , mayor
