@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 -- on july 21 , @entity4 was resting after a day of teaching his 82 primary school students			1
he reclined in the shade of his family 's home in the @entity0 district of @entity1 , a state in northeast @entity2 bordering @entity10 and @entity11			1
suddenly , his village came under attack			0
men wielding guns , fired shots into the air and torched houses including his			0
@entity4 and his family ran to the forest and waited for the attackers to leave , watching their village burn to the ground			0
" as we left the village later , i saw the school where i taught , " said @entity4			0
" it was also gone -- burned			0
" more than 300,000 people , including @entity4 and his family , fled the riots that lasted for two weeks and burned their villages in western @entity1			1
the riots started after the killings of two muslims and four @entity35 , a politically powerful tribal group in @entity1 , that heightened tensions between the two groups , according to local news reports and a human rights report			1
while the july riots were not the first violent incidents in @entity1 , the subsequent displacement is being called the biggest since @entity2 's independence			1
ethnic clashes in @entity2 kill dozens , displace thousands many residents scattered in search of safety and fled to relief camps set up in schools in neighboring communities			1
as a result , the start of the academic year for tens of thousands of students has been canceled as classrooms became dormitories for the displaced			1
" my students left for a one - month summer holiday on july 1 , " said @entity58 , a principal whose school is a relief camp			2
" they never came back			0
" two months after the riots , hundreds of schools remain relief camps			1
both the local people and the displaced are feeling the pressure			1
the @entity69 in @entity1 's @entity71 district , enrolled 1,300 students and now houses more than 6,000 people			1
in early september , local students held a rally demanding that their school re-open , said @entity77 , the principal			2
even during the protest , @entity77 said , " no one had an answer for how to get these people back to their villages safely			1
" photos : aftermath of ethnic riots in @entity2 @entity86 , a father of four , has lived in a relief camp at nearby @entity88 for two months			1
" the local people complain that their school is being used for the camp , " he said			2
he worried about the disruptions in his children 's lives , but did not think it was safe to return to their village yet			0
texts trigger mass panic in @entity1 " look at this situation , " he said , gesturing at a group of children splashing through a puddle with garbage floating in it			1
" why would we want to stay here ? " it makes us feel bad to take the school from other people -- but where do we go ? " he asked			1
his 14 - year - old son @entity110 added : " we are using this school for a living place , not a school			0
we live in uncertainty day to day , just surviving here			0
" experts are concerned that a gap in schooling could have immediate and long - term effects on children			0
" even if education is interrupted for just a few months , it can be difficult to get children back into schools , " said @entity120 , director of the @entity121 at the @entity122 in @entity123 " just a daily gathering of teachers and students to read together or discuss the fragile situation around them -- this sense of regularity helps			1
" some schools have begun to improvise			2
at the @entity137 , administrators set up alternative sites for classes to take place			2
some students have classes in a local sports club building , a small concrete structure near the school campus			1
when the monsoon rains stop and the ground dries , administrators said they plan to hold classes in nearby fields			2
but the alternative facilities are not an ideal substitute			0
" there is no academic atmosphere , " said teacher @entity152 , as he stood next to his corroded chalkboard in a small thatched building as the ceiling drooped in over his head			0
" the students get distracted			2
" observers say continuous education is crucial for the future stability of the region			0
" delaying the education of a student in a village because some other people burned it down -- the child will remember that			2
it will inform his politics for the rest of his life , " said @entity170 , professor of political science at @entity172			0
" the memory of your school being taken over by desperate people fleeing violence can have a similar effect , " he said			2
@entity183 , head of the political science department at @entity185 in @entity1 's capital , said : " education is the only hope for children to have a future , especially if their family 's land is getting squeezed			1
" the july violence fomented amid the long history of political tension and land disputes in @entity1			1
for decades , indigenous people , most prominently the @entity35 tribe , have fought for autonomy			0
@entity35 were granted territorial and political sub-autonomy by the @entity2 government in 2003			0
since then , muslims in the area claim they have been pushed off the land			0
the local issues in @entity1 have become touchstones for political debates across @entity2			2
rumors send thousands fleeing in @entity2 " we have failed as a state to manage our diversity , " said @entity183			0
a recent report on the violence by the @entity216 - based @entity215 claims that a lack of political will to intervene allowed the july riots to take place and that this permits the suffering of students to continue			1
" what we 're seeing now in the government 's lack of action on the education issue is the same kind of negligence , " said @entity223 , the center 's director			0
about 200,000 people remain in the cramped relief camps			0
most are @entity235 families ; some are undergoing verification to prove they are @entity2 citizens , which could take months since many lost documents in their scorched homes			0
unavailable to speak with @entity3 , @entity1 's education minister stated in late august that schools must re-open , but no official decision has been implemented .			1
