@entity1 's terror did n't end when the ground stopped shaking			1
reports of rape and sexual violence have been all too common after the january 2010 earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced almost 25 % of the entire population			1
" on the evening of january 20 , several young men were firing gunshots in the air			0
they came into our shelter and grabbed my 19 - year - old niece , " one woman , @entity12 , told @entity13			0
" they just came in , grabbed her and dragged her away			0
... she was raped by several men			0
they took her at around 9 p.m. and let her go at around 2 a.m. " another woman , @entity20 , told the rights group that she and her 13 - year - old daughter were attacked on the same night in march 2010			0
the men wore hoods and told @entity25 that if she went to the police , she would be shot dead			0
" there is nowhere safe where i can live , so i had to keep quiet , " she said			0
" i did n't take my daughter to the hospital			0
i sent her to another town where some relatives live			0
" in the days following the disaster , camps were set up to provide shelter for more than a million displaced @entity1			1
but these " tent cities " have been far from ideal , according to @entity35 , one of this year 's top 10 @entity36			1
" after the earthquake , the situation was inhumane and degrading			2
there was no food ; there was no work , " said @entity35 , a rape survivor who co-founded an organization , @entity42 , that helps other victims find safety , medical aid and legal support			1
" two years after the earthquake , it is still the same , " she said			1
" the people are still under the tent , they do n't have electricity , they are getting raped			2
" nearly 370,000 people remain in displacement camps , according to the @entity60 and gruesome reports of violence , inadequate health care and substandard living conditions have painted a picture of horror and hopelessness			1
in one study , published in january by the @entity70 and @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , 14 % of households reported that at least one member of the household had been a victim of sexual violence since the earthquake			1
and 70 % of households surveyed said they were now more worried about sexual violence			1
residents have cited lack of lighting , long walks to the bathroom , and flimsy tents as some of the issues putting females at risk of attack			0
many females also are on their own for the first time			0
" women and girls were left to fend for themselves in camps , " said @entity91 , project coordinator for @entity92 , a nonprofit that has been working with more than 70 @entity1 support groups to track post-earthquake violence			1
" because of the great displacement , people lost that sense of community protection			2
" accurate numbers of gender - based violence are difficult to find in the aftermath of such devastation , especially when many victims fear retaliation			1
but @entity91 said her group has seen a steady rise in reports , which she attributes to increased outreach			2
one young woman , @entity112 , was raped in the @entity114 camp and had her jaw broken			0
she said she was also forced into prostitution so she could eat and survive			0
high numbers of adolescent girls are engaging in what they call " transactional sex " for shelter and food , @entity91 said			0
many of those interviewed claimed they had never sold sex before , but the earthquake had left them no option			2
" i call this gender aftershocks , " said @entity91 , whose group is publishing their report on @entity1 next month			1
" these women and girls have no means of survival and are engaging in transactional sex work -- or survival sex -- sometimes just for shelter			2
" and many of those women -- as well as those who have been raped -- are becoming pregnant , raising fears about rising maternal health issues			2
even before the quake , @entity1 was the most dangerous place to be pregnant in the @entity144 : the lifetime risk of dying during childbirth there is 1 in 47			1
" we followed up with a number of pregnant girls who were no longer pregnant , " @entity91 said			0
according to her sources , there has been a high rate of illegal street abortions and child abandonment			0
but amid the depressing and dire reports comes a glimmer of hope			1
@entity42 and other groups are working to help young girls and women , giving them safety , support and training so they can make money and not have to sell themselves			1
better lighting has been installed in some displacement camps			1
more than 10,000 military and police personnel are now helping to provide security throughout the country , and hundreds of @entity60 peacekeepers have been assigned to specifically work with the @entity175			0
and in the last two years , there has been a big change in the way rape is prosecuted , according to legal experts			1
more women are reporting the crimes , and more rapists are being prosecuted			1
" there has been a higher percentage of complaints that are turning into pre-trial investigations and are leading to formal charges , " said @entity184 , director of the @entity185			0
in the first two years after the quake , sources in @entity1 had estimated there were few , if any , rape convictions			1
but this year there have already been more than 60 convictions for sex crimes in @entity1 , according to the @entity198			1
this summer , 22 rape cases were prosecuted and there were 13 convictions , said @entity202 , a lawyer who has worked with @entity1 rape victims			1
there was one acquittal , and eight of the trials were " left blank " for a number of reasons , including lack of representation for the victim who may not have even known she was to appear in court			0
" it sounds like it 's a small number , it sounds like more should have been filed since 2010 , " @entity214 said			2
" but we should take into consideration the biases of the system and level of disorganization and corruption			0
it really is an accomplishment			0
i 've heard those numbers are much higher now than even before the earthquake			2
" @entity228 photos : rape adds to @entity1 camp woes @entity184 said @entity1 's justice system has a history " of not taking rape that seriously			1
" it was n't until 2005 that rape was classified as a crime on par with an assault			2
before that , rape was a " crime against public morals , " which @entity184 says is something like a misdemeanor compared with a felony			0
now the challenge is changing attitudes and empowering women to speak up			0
while it still can be difficult for many victims to file a police report and obtain the necessary medical documents needed to pursue justice , there are more resources for women who want to speak out			2
" all this progress is the result of advocacy by @entity42 and other grassroots women 's groups and their allies , " @entity184 said			2
" i believe that the progress has the potential to play a key role in transforming attitudes about violence against women -- not just in the justice system , but in @entity1 society as a whole			1
" more from @entity36 : @entity268 girls take brave first step young caregivers put life on hold what really sways teens not to drink , drive ?			0

nearly three years after @entity1 's earthquake , many are still living in displacement camps
women are reporting rape , sexual violence in these " tent cities "
but amid the depressing , dire reports comes a glimmer of hope
@entity290 @entity289 is reaching out to support @entity1 rape victims
