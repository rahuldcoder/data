-- according to @entity3 documents published in @entity5 's new book " @entity6 , " we now know that the @entity3 spies on embassies and missions all over the world , including those of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , the @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
this will certainly strain international relations , as happened when it was revealed that the @entity32 is eavesdropping on @entity35 chancellor @entity34 's cell phone -- but is anyone really surprised ? spying on foreign governments is what the @entity3 is supposed to do			1
much more problematic , and dangerous , is that the @entity3 spies on entire populations			1
it 's a mistake to have the same laws and organizations involved with both activities , and it 's time we separated the two			2
the former is espionage : the traditional mission of the @entity3			1
it 's an important military mission , both in peacetime and wartime , and something that 's not going to go away			1
decisions of whom to target are decisions of foreign policy			0
the latter is very different			0
terrorists are a different type of enemy ; they 're individual actors instead of state governments			0
we know who foreign government officials are and where they 're located : in government offices in their home countries , and embassies abroad			2
terrorists could be anyone , anywhere in the world			0
to find them , the @entity3 has to look for individual bad actors swimming in a sea of innocent people			2
this is why the @entity3 turned to broad surveillance of populations , both in the @entity32 and internationally			1
if you think about it , this is much more of a law enforcement sort of activity than a military activity			0
both involve security , but just as the @entity3 's traditional focus was governments , the @entity93 's traditional focus was individuals			1
before and after 9/11 , both the @entity3 and the @entity93 were involved in counterterrorism			2
the @entity93 did work in the @entity32 and abroad			0
after 9/11 , the primary mission of counterterrorist surveillance was given to the @entity3 because it had existing capabilities , but the decision could have gone the other way			1
because the @entity3 got the mission , both the military norms and the legal framework from the espionage world carried over			1
our surveillance efforts against entire populations were kept as secret as our espionage efforts against governments			1
and we modified our laws accordingly			0
the 1978 @entity113 ( @entity113 ) that regulated @entity3 surveillance required targets to be " agents of a foreign power			1
" when the law was amended in 2008 under the @entity120 , a target could be any foreigner anywhere			0
government - on - government espionage is as old as governments themselves , and is the proper purview of the military			1
so let the commander in chief make the determination on whose cell phones to eavesdrop on , and let the @entity3 carry those orders out			2
surveillance is a large - scale activity , potentially affecting billions of people , and different rules have to apply -- the rules of the police			0
any organization doing such surveillance should apply the police norms of probable cause , due process and oversight to population surveillance activities			0
it should make its activities much less secret and more transparent			0
it should be accountable in open courts			0
this is how we and the rest of the world regain the trust in the actions of the @entity32			0
in january , president @entity155 gave a speech on the @entity3 where he said two very important things			2
he said that the @entity3 would no longer spy on @entity34 's cell phone			1
and while he did n't extend that courtesy to the other 82 million citizens of @entity35 , he did say that he would extend some @entity32 constitutional protections against warrantless surveillance to the rest of the world			0
separating espionage from surveillance , and putting the latter under a law enforcement regime instead of a military regime , is a step toward achieving that .			2
