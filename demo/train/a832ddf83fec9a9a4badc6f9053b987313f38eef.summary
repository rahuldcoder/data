@entity0 -- president @entity2 has declared a national emergency to deal with the " rapid increase in illness " from the @entity7 influenza virus			1

" the president signed the declaration late friday and announced it saturday			0
calling the emergency declaration " an important tool in our kit going forward , " one administration official called @entity2 's action a " proactive measure that 's not in response to any new development			1
" having trouble finding vaccine ? share your story another administration official said the move is " not tied to the current case count " and " gives the federal government more power to help states " by lifting bureaucratic requirements -- both in treating patients and moving equipment to where it 's most needed			1
the officials did n't want their names used because they were not authorized to speak on the record			0
@entity2 's action allows @entity57 secretary @entity56 " to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements " to help health care facilities enact emergency plans to deal with the pandemic			1
