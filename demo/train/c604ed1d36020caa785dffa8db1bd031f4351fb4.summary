@entity0 -- an @entity3 lawyer made an embarrassing mistake in the @entity6 wrongful death trial -- confusing @entity8 host @entity7 with the @entity10 ' former nanny			1
it happened thursday as attorney @entity13 cross examined @entity14 -- @entity6 's oldest nephew -- who had just described a close and lovely relationship between the late pop icon and his three children			1
did @entity14 think @entity19 -- who served for years as the nanny for @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 -- was " dishonest at times , " @entity13 asked			1
the judge ordered him to answer , overruling a @entity24 lawyer 's objections that the question was irrelevant to the case			1
" i have not experienced her dishonesty , " @entity24 answered			0
@entity13 then presented something she apparently thought would discredit @entity24 's testimony , showing he was not being honest			1
it was a " @entity37 " message posted online by him on december 11 , 2011			0
@entity37 is a service that allows users to post longer messages on @entity41			0
@entity14 was discussing his dislike of journalist @entity44 , who he called " anti-jackson " and a " sneaky snake			0
" " sorry ... but there are a couple of people who truly disgust me			0
and to me , he belongs in the same category as @entity7 , @entity54 , and @entity55 , " he wrote			2
does that document refresh his recollection of your opinion of @entity19 , @entity13 asked			0
" that 's not the same , " he responded			0
" that 's @entity7 ! " it took several seconds for the loud laughter in the courtroom to subside			2
@entity66 is @entity66 , a journalist unpopular with many @entity24 fans for writing a book about @entity24 's child molestation trial , and @entity55 is the journalist who conducted a series of interviews with @entity24 that fans blame for triggering the molestation charges			2
@entity19 -- not the tv host -- is expected to testify in the next week about her observations of @entity6 's relationship with his children			1
if jurors decide that @entity3 is liable for damages in @entity24 's death , they will have to place a monetary value on the emotional loss his children suffered			1
two handwritten notes found in @entity24 's bedroom by the family were read to jurors thursday in an effort to demonstrate the love			1
@entity14 identified one as the handwriting of @entity23 , who was 11 when her father died : " @entity96 , i love you so much & i 'm so glad i got a goodnight hug			1
i love you and good night			0
i 'll see you tomorrow			0
lots of love @entity101 " the other note was @entity6 's handwriting : " @entity106 my son , 6 years young			2
' what 's your favorite letter @entity109 ? mine is ' g ' for @entity111 and d for @entity109 ' age 6 , @entity114			0
" @entity24 lawyer @entity115 suggested the father 's note showed how dedicated he was to his children since he took time to write down what his young son said			1
an expert in entertainment economics will be on the stand when the trial enters its12th week monday in a @entity0 court			0
certified public accountant @entity127 , who audits the earnings of some of the world 's biggest entertainers , will give his opinion on how much income @entity24 would have earned had he not died of a propofol overdose while preparing for a comeback tour four years ago			0
@entity24 's mother and three children contend that @entity3 , the promoter and producer of the " @entity141 " concerts , was liable for the the negligent hiring , retention or supervision of dr. @entity145 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
@entity3 lawyers argue it was @entity24 , not their executives , who chose and controlled dr. @entity145 and that they had no way of knowing about the dangerous propofol infusions he was giving @entity24 to treat his insomnia .			2

@entity3 lawyer thought online posting would discredit @entity14 's testimony
@entity24 said " @entity7 " comment was about the @entity8 host , not the @entity161
handwritten notes show love between @entity6 and his children , lawyer says
" @entity96 , i love you so much & i 'm so glad i got a goodnight hug . sleep well , " @entity23 wrote
