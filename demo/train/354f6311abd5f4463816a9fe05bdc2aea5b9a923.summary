@entity0 -- the conversation between space cadet and world leader had a simple purpose : to make an ill teenager happy			2
that 's how @entity10 space tourist and software entrepreneur @entity8 remembers the day he spoke to @entity11 , the hero of @entity10 's anti-apartheid struggle , who died last week aged 95			1
" he brought a little girl with him who was very ill , it was such a classic @entity11 move , " @entity8 told @entity1 during tech conference @entity14 , being held in @entity0			1
" lots of people wanted to be on the phone with a space cadet and i get the impression that for many of them it was about the spotlight being on them , whereas for @entity11 ( @entity11 's tribal name ) the most wonderful thing for him was about making this little girl 's wish come true			1
" @entity31 , 14 , was terminally ill with cancer and through the reach for the dream foundation had been able to meet @entity11 and later link through satellite to @entity36 in space			1
@entity31 died less than a month after she 'd spoken to him			0
@entity8 , who founded software company @entity39 , recalled the conversation ahead of @entity11 's state funeral sunday , the conclusion of 10 official days of mourning			1
@entity11 's lasting lesson , @entity8 said , is that people should " find the @entity11 in our counterpart			1
" even good societies , societies filled with good people can end up in very dark places , " he said			0
" we should focus on the rules of society and the norms of society and make sure those are n't ripe for abuse			0
" there could even be lessons for dealing with terrorist organizations , like @entity60 , @entity8 said			2
" do n't tell me there is n't somebody in every institution who does n't have the capacity to transcend the mess they 've got themselves into			0
" @entity8 's conversation with @entity11 was in 2002 , when space tourism was in its infancy and only two paying guests had gone into orbit			1
@entity8 reportedly paid $ 20 million to travel with @entity74 cosmonaut @entity73 and spend a short time at the @entity76			2
a decade later , @entity79 's @entity78 's @entity77 is one several companies pushing to make space tourism a reality			2
meanwhile , @entity8 predicts , the world will see first " the first commercial suborbital flights in the new two years ... and i think we will see a partly commercial interplanetary flight in the next 10 years			2
" eventually , humans will move beyond earth , he said			0
" i think our destiny is in the stars ... there is probably a habitable planet out there within 15 light years of us			0
" that , he adds , is " in our neighborhood			0
" " the galaxy is around 100,000 light years across so 15 light years is very little			0
it may take us a couple hundred years to achieve that but look back a couple of years and you 're at the rebuilding of @entity0 , so i think this is the sort of timescale we should be dreaming in			0

@entity8 wo n't give details yet -- it 's expected to be made public in 2014 -- but says it 's a step forward from the company 's work with personal computers and could eventually position it to compete with the likes of @entity119			1
while the operating system market is dominated by giants such as @entity122 and @entity123 , @entity8 sees opportunity in " convergence , " when all mobile devices run seamlessly from one set - up			1
