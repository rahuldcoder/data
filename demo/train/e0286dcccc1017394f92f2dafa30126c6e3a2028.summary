-- last week , @entity0 was on the scene for the reunion taping of " @entity3 : reunited , " which will air this evening at 9 p.m. on @entity5			1
( of course , you 'll also be able to stream coverage of the show 's big coronation party in @entity10 -- there will be interviews with all this season 's queens -- on @entity15 , from 8 to 10:15 p.m. et tonight , too			1
) based on what happened at last week 's taping , the episode that airs tonight should be a doozy of an hour that will delve into the drama around @entity23 's surprising early exit from the season ; award one queen the @entity28 award ( you might be able to guess who , but i 'm not telling you ... ) ; and , of course , finally crown @entity32 , @entity33 , or @entity34 as @entity36 's @entity35			1
no one knows who will take home the glory except for one person : host and show namesake @entity43			1
which is why we here at @entity0 enlisted the drag legend for a quick chat last friday afternoon to discuss all things about tonight 's " reunited " special and season 4			1
read on for @entity52 's thoughts on the controversial decision to tape three endings to tonight 's episode ; why season 4 was stands out from the previous three ; the appeal of fallen queen @entity34 ; what 's going on with " all stars : @entity43 's @entity61 " ; and much , much more			1
@entity0 : i was at the reunion , which was oodles of fun			1
but walk me through your decision to tape it the way you did			2
why shoot the three endings ? @entity43 : i was so p * * * ed off that people had leaked it last year			1
i thought , how awful that they would n't consider everyone else 's enjoyment , but you have to understand that the human ego will do whatever it takes to get attention because it needs to know that it exists			2
so , people leaked that @entity83 was the winner last year , without thinking about other people 's enjoyment			2
i was so mad , so one morning , i woke up and between the time of getting out of bed and still kind of in a dream , it occurred to me that if we shot three endings ? then no one would know			2
of course , we had to do it in front of a live audience because the show has grown so much and there 's so much excitement			2
why not turn it into a super-huge event ? and you know , the taping was like the @entity104 for drag			2
it was ! @entity0 : the staging was beautiful , everyone looked great			1
you elevated it to the next level			2
was that the goal ? @entity43 : we had to because this show was so near and dear to so many people 's hearts , and we 're really changing the level that people come to expect from drag			1
during the @entity121 era , drag really had been the step child of the gay right 's movement , even though we were the ones who got things rocking at @entity127			2
so , i love drag , i love the art of drag , i love people who have the chutzpah to really get down and do drag because it takes a lot of balls to do drag and it takes a lot of courage for someone to get out there and say , " you know what ? i know what society expects of me , but you know what ? f * * * you , i 'm going to do it anyway			2
" @entity0 : were you happy with the way the reunion turned out ? did it come off as you had envisioned it ? @entity43 : oh my @entity150 , it was so much more			1
i had so much fun doing it			2
i was actually high from it the whole next day			2
the whole next day ! and strangely , it came off without a hitch			0
we started a little bit late , but it went without a hitch			0
it was kind of scary			0
i had to ask them , " are you guys sure you put film in the camera ? " because everything went so smoothly			0
@entity0 : did you have a favorite moment from the reunion ? @entity43 : yes , my favorite part of the night was when i came out and i said to the audience , " we have @entity61 royalty here			1
hey @entity173 ! " [ @entity174			0
] @entity0 : that was indeed a moment			1
why did you love that so much ? @entity43 : we have changed the star system			1
we have created a new star system , where @entity173 -- who , in the history of our show , was the first queen eliminated -- is sitting front row , center , and is acknowledged for the grand dame legend that she is			0
in the other star system of @entity191 , you know , you 're here today and gone tomorrow			0
but not so with our show , and we 're creating a while new vernacular and a whole new star system			0
@entity0 : well , it 's almost like you 've created a " @entity61 " family -- which is so cool , in my opinion			1
@entity43 : it is cool , especially in what 's thought of as a disenfranchised subculture of a subculture			1
@entity0 : do you ever think about how insanely buzzy this show is compared to other shows that are maybe 10 or 15 times bigger , in terms of audience ? @entity43 : you know , i did n't think it would get to this point			1
i knew that there were people who absolutely loved drag and drag is their life , and i knew that there were people who understood drag			0
there are so many other layers to it , just by the nature of the beast			0
but i did n't know it would become such a cult hit , and sometimes it is disappointing because , yeah , there are shows that get 15 million viewers and our biggest audience is sometimes 1.5 million , maybe			0
but honestly , i 'd rather have that 1.5 million of devoted fans , who live and breathe this show , than the other			0
i 'm happy at @entity5			1
they let us do so much			0
they give us free reign , and i could n't ask for anything more			0
@entity0 : when you think about season 4 , compared to the three that came before it , how does it fit in -- or differ -- from those ? @entity43 : i think the characters are stronger			1
i think it 's more character - driven			0
before , we had a lot of pretty , pretty girls			0
you know , there were some pretty girls this season , but that was n't the main focus			2
the main focus was difference and character , and that 's why i think people are so passionate about this season			2
the bottom line is that people want to see themselves , they wan na see passion , and they wan na see characters			0
i think that 's why this is our biggest season ever			2
@entity0 : so , @entity32 , @entity34 , or @entity33 will win the crown on monday evening			1
why does each one , separately , deserve to win that crown ? @entity43 : i think what really describes them , each , is perseverance			1
and that 's really what our show is about			0
our show , at its core , is about the tenacity of the human spirit , and all three of them exemplify that to the umpteenth degree			0
i think , honestly , that 's why people are so passionate about the show			0
these girls represent the courage that they feel they have , or the courage that lies in potential in every human being			0
in terms of representing our show , all three are strong characters , they have a strong story is easy to root for , and that 's why people love them so much			0
whichever one wins the crown will be a great representative			0
@entity0 : let 's talk about @entity34 real quick			1
but what is her appeal ? @entity43 : she is that earth mother			1
she is that one who is not catty and who you can trust			0
how honest she was about her own story and how forthcoming she was with her story , it made everyone feel very comfortable			0
she 's a genuine person and so wise			0
i think that is why people love her so much			0
plus , she 's an amazing performer			0
amazing ! @entity0 : how much did fan lobbying have to do with the decision for this year 's crown ? did you really let fans influence you ? @entity43 : well , you know , it does influence to a certain degree , but obviously , ultimately , the decision is mine			1
] @entity0 : so that decision -- let 's talk about it			1
it 's friday afternoon right now , the friday before the monday airing of the reunion finale			2
have you made it yet ? @entity43 : yeah , i 've made it			1
@entity0 : on monday , where will you be when the episode is airing ? @entity43 : i have threatened to go to some of the clubs here in @entity343			1
well , no , the club owners do n't know yet , but i may , i may go to the @entity345 and then go to @entity346 's			0
and then probably @entity347 , too			0
one of the other " @entity61 " producers suggested that we do a drive - by at all these clubs			1
@entity0 : so " all stars : @entity43 's @entity61			1
" i 'm obsessed with it			0
what can you say about it at this person ? @entity43 : well , i know fans are going to be excited about it either way			1
i ca n't tell you much about " @entity363 " right now , but i tell you that it 's going to be the favorites , it 's going to be the favorites from all seasons			0
a girl for all seasons ! a drag for all seasons ! we basically wait a year for each series , so this 'll be in the interim			0
" @entity376 " and then " @entity363 " and then " @entity61 " season 5			1
@entity0 : with " @entity363 , " regular " @entity61 , " and " @entity376 , " you 're taking over @entity5			1
will there be a day where something from the " @entity61 " universe is on @entity5 every week ? @entity43 : [ @entity174			1
] you know , we should have our own sub-channel called @entity386			0
sure , why not ! see the full article at @entity0			2
