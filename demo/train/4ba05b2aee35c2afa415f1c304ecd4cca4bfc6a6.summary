@entity0 -- there is no constitutional requirement that the @entity4 preside over the inaugural - it 's just been that way and a little history was made around that on sunday			1
chief justice @entity9 delivered the oath at the @entity11 to president @entity12 for a second term			1
just prior , justice @entity14 swore in @entity15 to another four years as vice president , becoming the first @entity18 jurist to administer an inaugural oath			1
@entity15 was instrumental in @entity14 's vetting and ultimate selection by @entity12 for the high court and said it was an " incredible honor " for him to have her deliver the oath			1
the justice told @entity1 's @entity27 on friday that she was not feeling anxious about the inaugural duties , but rather viewing the responsibilities as " surreal			0
" " i was thinking just a couple of days ago , if i think back when i was a kid which of the two would seem more improbable to me i realized each one was so far fetched that i could n't have imagine either , " she saidâ € ” sitting on the @entity4 " and swearing in the vice president in front of the nation and the world			1
" 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on @entity1 's platforms and nowhere else sunday 's vice presidential inauguration at the @entity42 , where @entity15 lives , was moved up to accommodate @entity14 's scheduling conflict			1
" i want to explain to you what a wonderful honor it was and how much out of her way the justice had to go , " @entity15 said			1
" she is due in @entity51			0
she has to leave right now , so i apologize			0
" @entity14 then headed out to catch a train to the @entity54 for a book signing for her new autobiography , " @entity57			2
" the swearing in went off without a hitch , which @entity14 said was a result of careful planning on her part			2
" when you read my book , you realize i practice everything i do over and over again , " she told @entity1			0
like @entity9 , @entity14 had the oath written on a small card			1
after delivering it , she offered a simple " congratulations			0
" she will be back in @entity0 for monday 's public swearing in at the @entity71 where she will administer the oath to @entity15 again			1
@entity9 will do the same for @entity12			0
@entity12 sworn in during private ceremony the @entity74 requires executive officers , including the president , as well as members of @entity78 and federal judges , to " be bound by oath or affirmation			2
" but nothing mandates a @entity4 justice administer it			2
when it comes to the presidential inauguration , they just have done so most of the time			0
there was no @entity4 formed when @entity90 took the first oath of office in 1789 , so @entity51 's highest ranking judge did the honors at @entity95 on @entity96			1
four years later , associate justice @entity97 swore in @entity0 for a second term , beginning the @entity4 tradition			2
early inaugurals were usually conducted in the @entity11 or @entity102 chamber			0
the 1817 inaugural was held outdoors for the first time when @entity105 took the oath in front of the @entity71 , where @entity78 met temporarily after the original @entity71 was burned by @entity109 troops in the @entity110			0
the @entity112 swearing - in site is now the @entity4 building			2
the man who handled the duties 196 years ago was @entity116 , widely acknowledged as the most influential chief justice in @entity119 history			0
he participated in a record nine swear - ins , from @entity121 to @entity122 .			0

@entity18 justice , @entity14 , swears in vice president @entity15
no requirement @entity4 deliver presidential oath , it just happens that way
no @entity4 when @entity90 sworn in as president in 1789
