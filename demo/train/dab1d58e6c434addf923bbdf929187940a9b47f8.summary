this summer , as " @entity10 " returns to theaters in sing - a - long form , it 's clear : films that feature dance are bigger than ever			2
accordingly , we 've compiled a list of some of the best dance scenes ever shown on - screen			1
grease pollyanna - ish @entity19 need n't have bothered with her bad - girl makeover : she 'd already won @entity22 's heart			2
but we love the way @entity25 and @entity26 's tight , black , " greaser " duds contrast with their super-sunny singing and dancing in this 1978 musical 's fun finale			1
@entity32 : see all the memorable dance scenes @entity34 in the 1957 musical , @entity35 played an amateur philosopher turned reluctant fashion model ( opposite dance legend @entity40 )			0
the beatnik black ensemble she wore for a scene in which she broke out into a @entity44 - style routine is still chic ; the sequence was repurposed by @entity46 in a 2006 ad for " skinny black pants			1
" @entity9 @entity49 and @entity50 worked as professional dancers prior to being cast in this 2006 sleeper hit ; their expert moves ( and , as seen here , ultra-realistic rehearsal gear ) were a big reason for the film 's unexpected success			0
( their obvious chemistry -- they started dating as soon filming wrapped and married last summer -- did n't hurt either			0
) @entity32 : see @entity61 host @entity60 's exclusive style diary @entity63 in 2002 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 starred in this @entity68 version of the popular musical			1
the film 's critical and commercial success paved the way for subsequent stage - to - screen adaptations like @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , and even @entity78			1
( and did n't @entity79 look divine as 1920 's - era murderess / aspiring showgirl @entity82 ? ) @entity32 : @entity64 's transformation flashdance this 1983 movie about an eighteen - year - old steel worker / aspiring dancer was responsible for the slashing of a million sweatshirts ; the insouciant off - the - shoulder style worn by actress @entity89 is still popular			1
( the scene in which she douses herself , mid-dance , with a bucketful of water , is just as difficult to forget			0
) @entity95 @entity26 went from sitcom star to big - screen sensation after this movie 's 1977 release			1
his white three - piece suit and impossibly smooth moves combined with a best - selling soundtrack by the @entity103 made disco more popular than ever			1
@entity32 : the 21 most iconic swimsuits ever @entity106 starring a mix of little - known young actors -- like future @entity111 star @entity110 -- and professional ballet dancers , this 2000 film followed students at a fictional @entity115 dance school			1
there was a run on red toe shoes after star @entity119 donned them for the high - energy workshop scene ( in which she twirled to a pop soundtrack of @entity124 and @entity125 )			2
footloose a much - delayed remake is scheduled to debut in 2011 , but we 're not sure it 's possible to improve on the 1984 original -- we particularly like the scene in which small - town transplant @entity130 ( @entity132 ) dances his troubles away in an empty warehouse			0
the setting , along with his super-basic sweatshirt , jeans , and sneakers , set off his transcendent steps			0
@entity142 a @entity115 - set update of @entity146 's @entity145 , the 1961 film is beset by tragedy in the second half			0
but @entity150 's spirited , twirling defense of " @entity151 " is -- much like the hot - house colors of the ladies ' dresses -- nothing short of exuberant			0
@entity32 : @entity157 ' most memorable dresses @entity158 the rolled - up jean shorts that @entity160 wore throughout this 1963 - set flick proved almost as popular in 1987 as the film itself			2
and who did n't love the final scene , in which @entity167 ( @entity166 ) " dirty " danced to ( and even lip - synced along with ) the then - contemporary song " i 've had the @entity170 " ? see if your favorites made our list in our expanded gallery at @entity32			0
