-- it 's 35 years after the release of @entity4 's groundbreaking album " rumours , " and @entity6 and @entity7 are holding hands			1
maybe it 's true that absence makes the heart grow fonder			1
or maybe it 's a put - on , knowing that fans are still intrigued by the complicated interpersonal drama that drives the band			1
" @entity20 " gave listeners a voyeuristic peek into the messy romantic lives of the quintet			0
" @entity21 " was @entity23 's anguished kiss - off to @entity6			2
" @entity28 " was @entity25 's song of encouragement to her soon - to - be ex-husband , @entity27			2
a special anniversary reissue of " rumours " is now available , with expanded and deluxe versions featuring previously unreleased demos and early takes , along with a dozen live recordings from the group 's 1977 world tour			1
at 35 , still the ' perfect album ' in april , @entity6 and @entity23 will join drummer @entity37 and bassist @entity27 for their first tour in three years			1
in addition to their arsenal of beloved hits , they 're hoping to crowd - test three newly recorded tracks			0
" we have two brand new songs and one really , really old song , " @entity6 said			0
the " old " tune predates @entity4 : an unreleased nugget written for the " @entity53 " lp , which marks its 40th anniversary this year			1
the two " new " tracks were penned by @entity7			0
last year , he went into the studio with @entity4 and @entity56 to record eight songs they hoped would become the catalyst for a new @entity4 album			1
" we really did n't want to rent a house for a year and then make a whole record with 13 , 14 , 15 songs on it , then have most of the people who are thinking about buying it buy one song , " she explained			0
" so we did the three songs , and we 'll see how the world reacts to that			0
if they love those three songs , then maybe they might talk us into doing something else			0
" maybe @entity6 and @entity23 's hand - holding is n't for the cameras			2
maybe it 's to remind each other that despite their differences , they remain personally supportive and unified in their commitment to the juggernaut that is @entity4 -- even if it means playing mostly vintage hits for their upcoming tour			1
" that 's okay , " @entity7 conceded			2
" that 's part and parcel with what we do			0
" " we laugh , " added @entity6 , " but ( the classics are ) why we all have a beautiful house			0

it 's the 35th anniversary of @entity4 's groundbreaking " rumours "
a special anniversary reissue of " rumours " is now available
in april , the group will tour for the first time in three years
