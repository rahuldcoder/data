the first indication that something was wrong was a phone call from his daughter 's @entity5 area school to let @entity8 know that she had not come to class			2
but , officials say , she did n't tell him that she was on her way to @entity15 to join @entity16			1
she was just late for class , that 's all , @entity8 's daughter told him on friday , according to the @entity20 , which filed a runaway report			0
the @entity23 girl of @entity25 descent also kept quiet about her two girlfriends , @entity23 of @entity27 descent , who were flying with her to @entity28 by way of @entity30			1
two more girls , sisters those two had told their father , @entity32 , that they were going to the library			2
but when @entity35 got home from work , a visitor came calling , according to the documents			0
apparently , it was @entity8			0
@entity35 should check to see if his daughters ' passports were missing , the visitor told him -- just like his daughter 's passport was			0
sure enough , they were gone , along with $ 2,000 in cash			1
the two families called the @entity48			0
they said they thought the girls were on their way to @entity28			1
the agency put out a notice on their passports			0
@entity30 authorities intercepted the trio , ages 15 , 16 and 17 , at @entity56 and put them on a plane back to the @entity23 , where they were greeted by @entity48 agents			1
the three girls were questioned and released			2
two @entity23 officials say they had planned to join militants with @entity16 , the @entity64 in @entity65 and @entity15			1
out of the blue the girls ' parents say they had no idea their children planned to travel			1
none of them had ever run away before			0
their disappearance hit them out of the blue , the way other @entity16 related incidents are popping up in the western world			1
two more turned up in tandem with the girls ' runaway attempt			2
on monday , a radical convert to @entity83 in @entity84 ran down two soldiers in his car , killing one of them			0
@entity89 , 25 , then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of @entity94 , southeast of @entity95			0
he exited the car , and police shot him dead			0
back in july , @entity97 , too , had tried to join foreign jihad , and @entity84 police arrested him on his way to @entity28			1
but they could not charge him and had to let him go			0
and this week , a video turned up of a 17 - year - old @entity104 boy standing with @entity16 fighters and threatening to behead @entity107 leaders , including president @entity108 , then fly the @entity16 flag over the @entity110			1
@entity112 teen pleads guilty in plan to join @entity16 @entity16 ' draw @entity16 has , for an anti-western organization , been surprisingly attractive to young recruits from the @entity117 , as well as to some young women			1
more than 100 of the foreign fighters have come from the @entity23 , according to intelligence estimates ; hundreds more from @entity121 , which is geographically closer to the fight			0
every week , five more people from the @entity124 alone join @entity16 , a @entity124 police commissioner said tuesday			1
and that 's a conservative estimate			0
" we know that over 500 @entity124 nationals traveled to join the conflict , " said sir @entity127 from the @entity128			2
" five a week does n't sound much , but when you realize there are 50 weeks in a year , 250 more would be 50 % more than we think have gone already , " he said			0
to put things into perspective , though , thousands more come from the @entity136 and @entity137			0
more than 3,000 have joined from @entity138			0
sense of belonging it 's more than just a radical interpretation of @entity83 that is drawing teens to the extremely bloodthirsty militant group , a former @entity141 officer says			0
" they 're often times searching for an identity , because what the jihadis are actually pushing is a specific narrative , which is : your people ( @entity152 ) are being oppressed in this place called @entity15 ; your government is doing nothing ; we 're the only ones who are actually going to help you out , " said @entity151			1
" why do n't you join the fight ? " @entity161 of @entity162 says many of the teens lack a sense of belonging where they live , and they believe @entity16 can give it to them			1
" the general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in @entity15 suggests camaraderie , good morale and purposeful activity , all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism , designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self - esteem , " he says			1
and @entity16 constantly cranks the pr machine , making expert use of slick videos and social media			1
echoing back @entity185 @entity16 ' global digital reach has terror experts in the @entity23 worried about security at home as well			1
there are terrorist groups in @entity192 and in @entity15 with stated ambitions of striking on @entity23 soil , but another threat is more probable , says counterterrorism expert @entity196			2
" i would say the most likely types of attack is one of these homegrown violent extremists or lone offenders in the @entity23 , and ( with ) the rise of @entity16 and the number of people going to @entity15 ... the likelihood does go up			1
" self - styled attackers like the @entity209 bombers could be the result			0
the use of the @entity212 makes terrorists more vulnerable to tracking , but that has become more difficult since @entity216 revealed secret @entity23 surveillance programs			0
opinion : what lures @entity23 to @entity15 fight ? girls ' online activities in @entity5 , the 17 - year - old girl was apparently the instigator of the trip , having planned it for months , two @entity23 officials said			1
but all three researched the plan online , visiting websites where extremists discuss how to get to @entity15			2
the online activity did n't set off any tripwires the @entity48 typically uses to flag possible jihadist sympathizers , the officials said			2
the @entity48 is combing all of their communications to see if anyone was helping them			0
their parents think @entity16 was behind the trip			1
investigators are also not sure the girls had even worked out the final goal for their travel			2
as was the case with the @entity84 , @entity97 , the investigation into the travel will probably not lead to charges , especially because the girls are minors , the two @entity23 officials said			2
on monday , sheriff 's deputy @entity247 visited the two girls of @entity27 descent in their home and had a conversation with them			1
" the girls explained that they stole the $ 2,000 and their passports from their mother , " he wrote in the runaway report			1
they would n't tell @entity247 why they flew to @entity30			2
the deputy called dispatchers and had the girls ' runaway listing removed			0
@entity1 's @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0

all three girls *skipped* school and took a flight to @entity30 , *wanted* to go to @entity28

two of the girls , of @entity27 descent , stole $ 2,000 from their parents
