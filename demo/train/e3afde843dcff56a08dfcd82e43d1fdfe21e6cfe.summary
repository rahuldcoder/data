-- the pronouncement by the @entity2 at its extraordinary synod that " homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the @entity7 " has left many pondering if this is a turning point for the @entity9 debate			1
i suggest that this is not a turning point particularly for the @entity13 , but rather the start of an openness in debate that will take a long time to change the @entity2 's doctrinal teaching			1
in a deeply conservative church that has for a long time viewed homosexuality as " an intrinsically disordered , contrary to natural law and can not be approved under any circumstances , " it will take more than a @entity25 statement to arrive at a turning point on the subject of homosexuality			2
a change in the doctrinal teaching / catechism of the church will take a long time and protracted debate in the @entity34 community			1
pope @entity36 ' papacy has been heavy on symbolism and rhetoric on previously sidelined ( and contentious ) social justice issues but the jury is still out over whether he will take concrete steps to change the position of the @entity2 on these issues			1
in july this year during a flight back to @entity45 from @entity46 after @entity48 celebrations , @entity36 responded to questions about the @entity51 's alleged gay lobby , by saying : " if a person is gay and seeks @entity53 and has good will , who am i to judge him ? " signaling an embrace of homosexuality into the @entity34 commune			1
but these pronouncement certainly do not bring the concrete steps to require a shift in position			1
there are reasons that explain why the excitement about the apparent change of tone must be tempered			2
firstly , the document is only but a preliminary , not final report			0
it is a summary of closed door debate between the @entity36 and the prelates			1
the document is a working document			0
it is not a papal decree or a doctrinal position			1
it is only indicative of the issues that were discussed in the closed door meeting			0
that the @entity25 have been open about their internal debate is admirable and must be lauded			0
but it will require much more than pronouncements to qualify as a critical departure from the @entity2 's position on homosexuality			1
in its conclusion , the 12 - page document notes that the reflections " are intended to raise questions and indicate perspectives that will have to be matured and made clearer by the reflection of the local churches			0
" opinions of local churches that are to reflect on this matter are still in sharp contrast with those being expressed in the @entity51 especially in @entity99			0
it will also be a tall order to change the hearts and minds of the vast majority of @entity104			1
in @entity107 for instance , the catholic archbishop @entity105 is one of the leading proponents of the re-tabling of the country 's expunged anti-homosexuality act , a controversial law that criminalized homosexuality provided for life imprisonment for same sex relations			0
it is unclear if such leaders will warm up to the changed tone from the @entity36 and the @entity51			2
if recent debates among @entity121 on the @entity99 continent is anything to go by , the turning point will be much more difficult to reach			0
the pronouncement sets the parameters for reflection in the form of questions			0
these questions challenge the church to reflect on whether it can guarantee homosexuals a fraternal space while re-echoing the long - held catechism on the subject			1
the world is desperate for new grounds to be broken			0
the optimism is therefore understandable but we all must receive the pronouncements with caution			0
lessons must be taken from the fall - out in the @entity143 between the global @entity144 arising from the ordination of openly gay bishops			0
it will not helpful if this debate only drives further apart rather than unites the @entity2			1
this will require patience , and a balancing of the diversities within the @entity2			2
the document , while sounding embracing of persons of different sexualities and children living in such relations , really restates the long - held position of the @entity2 in many respects about homosexuality			1
so it is important not to get ahead of ourselves about this minimal but important tone			0
the drive to push the @entity2 must be not only tolerant and accepting of sexual minorities but an ongoing effort			2
we must edge the @entity2 along and ensure the momentum is not lost			2

pronouncement by @entity2 on homosexuals leaves many asking what it means
@entity176 : this is start of long debate to change @entity2 's doctrinal teaching
