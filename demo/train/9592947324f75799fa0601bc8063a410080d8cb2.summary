-- the legendary @entity1 are the inspiration behind an ambitious plan to grow a rooftop forest high above @entity6 's crowded streets			1
the cityscape is currently overshadowed by concrete highrises , with parkland making up just 3 % of @entity11 's capital , according to a study by the @entity13			0
the lack of greenery has contributed to poor air quality and trapped heat , among a host of other environmental issues , claims architect @entity20			1
this led him to the the unconventional idea of greening over the city 's rooftops			1
" we want to cover the top of nearly every building in the city with trees , " said @entity20			1
challenging though it sounds , @entity20 's proposal does not involve complicated drainage systems or engineering			0
" we 're just talking about planting small to medium - sized trees in relatively large pots and securing them to the roofs , " he added			0
the 28 - year - old architect claims there are 15,000 suitable rooftops -- around 80 % of those in the city			1
" even planting just one on each would result in as many trees as there are in @entity45 's @entity44 , " he said			2
with colleagues at local @entity47 , @entity20 aims to plant 60,000 trees eventually			2
they say that as well as making a sizable dent in the level of carbon dioxide in the air , the trees would also create a rooftop canopy , casting shadows on the streets and helping to keep the city cool			1
nevertheless , @entity59 , if realized , would not be comparable to a public park			2
" planting trees in the ground is always preferable , and nothing can replace a wide open space to walk through , " said @entity20			0
comment : would you give the scheme your support ? is the @entity59 project a feasible and much needed innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream ? tell us you thoughts in the comments section below			2
@entity20 estimates the total cost of the project at $ 3.5 - 4 million and is currently lobbying for the @entity59 via @entity47 and a @entity77 page			0
ultimately though , the success of the idea is in the hands of @entity6 's residents -- who would need to tend the gardens , particularly over the hot summer months			1
" even if all the trees and their installation is provided , if the residents do n't subsequently get involved , then the plan will fail , " said @entity20			0
there could also be benefits for the green fingered , says @entity20 , who could turn a profit growing and selling olives and citrus fruits , which thrive in @entity6 's @entity94 climate			1

" just imagine : the world 's first rooftop garden city			0
