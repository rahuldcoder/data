-- what will ok go think of next ? the band 's creative videos have made use of treadmills , dominoes and optical illusions			1
in its latest , " @entity17 , " the foursome takes to the road -- and the sky -- thanks to camera - toting drones and some segway - like @entity15 vehicles called uni-cubs			1
the video is nearing 3 million views on @entity20			2
part of the idea came from a visit to @entity25 's @entity24 , kind of a @entity26 with robots			2
( " girls in bikinis battle enormous transformer - style robots , helped by @entity35 - style storm troopers on @entity37 motorcycles , " went the description of a @entity30 reviewer			0
) " it was the best hour of my life , " @entity38 's @entity38 told @entity39			1
the band worked with @entity45 director @entity44 to design the 5 - minute - plus clip , which begins with the group on @entity16 doing some leg moves and then rises high over a building lot while the band is joined by several -- and then dozens -- of umbrella - toting @entity45 schoolgirls			1
( a choreographer named airman handled the moves ; @entity15 supplied the uni-cubs and some backing			0
) eventually the proceedings moved to a warehouse for the conclusion , a colorful display -- like a stadium flip - card maneuver -- that includes pictures of the band members and a " ribbon " showing the title of the song			2
the last part took more than 50 tries and was shot at half - speed and then speeded up , the band members told @entity39			1
by this point , the drone camera was a half - mile up			0
the band 's videos sometimes take months to come together , @entity38 's @entity74 told @entity77 last month , and the day they debut is usually the quietest they 've had in a while			1
to really find out what fans think , he adds , the band prefers touring : " it 's actually really nice to get out in front of people and feel the energy			2
" still , the videos are part of a philosophy that tries to entertain as much as awe , @entity74 told @entity0 in 2010			0
" we make cool stuff , " he said			0
" we just think they 're fun			0
" next up : a trip on @entity98 ?			0

@entity38 's video , " @entity17 , " is their latest hit
this time , the group goes to @entity45 , and the video is shot by a drone
band also rides around on @entity16
