@entity0 -- at this very moment , in a major @entity4 city , a worker is boarding a train home			2
his journey is just one of 3.4 billion trips that will be taken during @entity4 's @entity10			1
an unprecedented number of @entity4 will travel home this year to be with family and friends during the holiday , making it the world 's largest annual migration of people			2
their yearly homecoming has been repeated over and over for the past two decades , reuniting families in the villages with the workers who have fueled @entity4 's economic miracle			1
but that growth has come at a tremendous personal cost thanks in part to a household registration system called " hukou			1
" the hukou is akin to an internal passport that divides the population into rural and urban residents			1
as such , migrant workers are prevented from accessing social services in the city they 're working in			1
photos : @entity4 's great migration the deeply discriminatory nature of @entity4 's hukou system came into clear focus last month after the fatal collapse of a bridge in @entity45			1
local media reports said victims ' families with an urban hukou would receive 400,000 yuan in compensation compared to 180,000 yuan for those with a rural hukou			0
the institutionalized restriction of people 's movement in @entity4 goes back for centuries , and was re-introduced by the @entity57 after 1949			2
labor rights activist @entity58 of @entity59 says @entity4 's booming economy in recent years has made many hukou restrictions disappear , especially those that restrict the freedom of movement			2
" but restrictions on access to education , welfare , medical and housing benefits still exist and disproportionately affect the poorest and least educated citizens , " he says			1
" in effect , the hukou system now only targets the poor			0
" opinion : why i dread @entity10 @entity58 was a democracy activist who set up the @entity75 during the 1989 @entity77 protests			0
he has spent the last two decades in exile in @entity0 , defending worker rights in @entity4			0
though not many people outside @entity4 have heard of the hukou system , @entity58 says they must for a very simple reason -- the bottom line			0
meaningful hukou reform would bring more riches to @entity4 's workers and the world			1
" if 200 million @entity4 workers , which is only about one - third of the total labor force in @entity4 , become regular consumers and taxpayers , not only will @entity4 's economy benefit , the rest of the world will benefit as well , as @entity4 consumes more products and services from abroad			1
" @entity98 , the @entity4 - based correspondent for @entity99 , often reports on labor issues in @entity4			0
he puts the plight of @entity4 's migrant workers under the hukou system in simple and stark terms : " they are treated like illegal immigrants inside their own country			1
" and these " illegals " make up a major portion of the urban populace			0
@entity111 may have a population of over 20 million , but migrant workers make up a third of its residents			1
thanks to the hukou system , one - third of the population of the @entity4 capital are without access to basic services like health care and education			1
" one of the biggest issues within the hukou system is the children , " says @entity125			0
" many children are born in the large cities where their parents have moved to			0
this is their hometown , as far as they know it ... but once they turn a certain age , and if they want to go to college someday , they will have to move to where their household registration is in their ' lao jia ' or home village			2
" it 's no surprise that many migrant workers choose to leave their children behind in their hometown to be raised by their grandparents			2
they are called " liu dong er tong " or " floating children			0
" @entity59 estimates there are some 16 million children " floating children " in @entity4			0
the group says they have a substandard education			0
they 're more prone to violence and crime			0
they are more vulnerable to sexual abuse			0
what fortune will the @entity157 bring you ? @entity111 has vowed to reform the hukou system as part of a greater urbanization drive -- encouraging more @entity4 to move to cities where they can earn more and spend more			0
and @entity4 's newest generation of migrant workers are pushing -- and protesting -- for that reform to come quickly			1
" today 's younger workers , who have greater aspirations and expectations than their parents , are much more likely to express their discontent with the system , especially the way it restricts their access to public schooling for their children , subsidized housing , health care , etc. , " says @entity58			2
" they see themselves as urban residents and believe more that they should have equal access to such services			1
" @entity183 of @entity184 adds that @entity4 's latest generation of workers are more rights - aware and willing to challenge the long - held registration system			1
" for the first generation of migrant workers , their hometown subsidized them and their children could go to school at home			2
but the new generation want their family to stay in the city			0
" after two decades of the " @entity199 , " @entity4 's latest generation of workers simply want to stay put			1
to hell with the hukou .			0
