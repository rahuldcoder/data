-- @entity1 came from behind to defeat @entity2 2 - 1 in thursday 's @entity4 quarterfinal , increasing the pressure on @entity2 coach @entity6			1
@entity8 's 10th - minute strike looked to have set the @entity2 on their way to a much - needed victory at the @entity11			0
but @entity12 levelled after 72 minutes and @entity13 grabbed a last - gasp winner for @entity1 to secure a two - legged last - four date with @entity15 next month			1
@entity6 's side came into the match on the back of five defeats in six @entity21 games and lying sixth in the table -- a mammoth 16 points adrift of leaders @entity1			0
but , despite their poor recent run , the visitors started well and broke the deadlock after just 10 minutes			0
@entity8 cut inside @entity28 and lashed a low shot through the legs of @entity1 goalkeeper @entity31			0
but @entity1 fought back after the break and levelled 18 minutes from time when goalkeeper @entity34 was left wrong - footed when @entity36 's free - kick took a wicked deflection -- and @entity12 nipped in at the far post to prod home the equalizer			0
and @entity34 was powerless to prevent @entity1 's winner at the death , keeping out @entity44 's initial effort but unable to prevent @entity13 to net the rebound			2
meanwhile , in @entity47 , @entity46 reached the @entity49 semifinals despite losing 1 - 0 at home to @entity51			1
@entity52 made up for an earlier penalty miss with a 45th - minute headed goal to level the aggregate score 2 - 2			2
but @entity46 's two away goals from the first leg 2 - 1 proved enough to send the @entity59 side through to face @entity60 in a repeat of the 2007 cup final .			1
