@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's historic cultural center , @entity4 , lacks electricity , water and phone service , because " terrorists " sabotaged the utilities there , a @entity11 - based spokesman for the ethnic @entity13 separatist party @entity12 said thursday			1
@entity12 spokesman @entity15 said most of the " terrorists " fled @entity4 for the desert after @entity18 planes on tuesday bombed the militants ' headquarters , which was built by former @entity22 leader @entity21			1
however , @entity15 warned , some militants remain in the fabled city			0
@entity15 's choice of the word " terrorists " highlights the ever - shifting alliances as @entity1 devolves into a wild frontier			1
@entity12 used to be aligned with @entity30 , one of the main @entity33 groups fighting to take over @entity1			1
but after @entity12 ousted the @entity1 army from @entity4 last year , @entity30 and @entity34 drove @entity12 away			1
the head of the @entity38 ' @entity37 , gen. @entity39 , spoke at @entity40 in @entity41 on thursday about the situation			0
he said his ultimate goal is helping a legitimate @entity1 government based in the capital of @entity0 control the whole country			2
@entity38 has flown seven cargo missions to @entity1 " territorial integrity of @entity1 is nonnegotiable			2
no discussion of a separatist state or something like that			0
but , it also appears that @entity1 has asked for , and will need , some help to establish government control in the north , " @entity39 said			2
" realistically , we would all like to see the elimination of @entity34 and others from northern @entity1			0
realistically , probably the best you can get is containment and disruption , so that @entity34 is no longer able to control territory as they do today			0
" " this must be in fact and in perception an @entity68 - led endeavor that is done at the request of the @entity1 government , and i think that is well under way now , " @entity39 added			0
but recent allegations against @entity1 troops have some human rights observers questioning whether the @entity1 army has right on its side , or just might			1
@entity1 soldiers have carried out a number of summary executions as they seek to drive back @entity33 militants who have been advancing from the north , a human rights group claimed thursday			1
@entity1 's military offensive against the militants has gathered pace in the past two weeks , with backing from @entity18 and other international allies			1
refugees tell harrowing stories of life under the @entity33 militants who hold northern @entity1 in an iron grip			1
but the @entity18 - based @entity92 said it was " very alarmed " by reports that @entity1 soldiers are themselves carrying out extrajudicial killings and abuses as they counterstrike			2
@entity92 claims the victims of these abuses have been anyone " accused of complicity with the jihadists or infiltrated elements , persons in possession of weapons , people who have no proof of their identity during military patrols or simply people targeted because of their belonging to certain ethnic groups			0
" the group said it had confirmed that @entity1 forces have carried out numerous executions in the key conflict area between the north and south , particularly in the towns of @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			1
" in @entity117 , at least 11 individuals were executed in the military camp , near the bus station and near the hospital , " the @entity92 said			0
reliable information indicates " close to 20 other executions in the same area where bodies are said to have been buried very hastily , in particular in the wells			0
in the @entity119 region , @entity1 soldiers killed two @entity1 of @entity13 origin			2
" the group says it has also been told of other summary executions in central @entity1 , and documents the pillaging of @entity13 homes by government soldiers			1
what 's behind instability in @entity1 ? a @entity1 military spokesman declined to comment on the record about the rights group 's allegations			1
the @entity92 called for the immediate establishment of an independent investigation commission " to assess the scope of these abuses and sanction the perpetrators			0
" although @entity1 and @entity18 politicians and military officials have repeatedly called for respect of international humanitarian law and human rights , the @entity92 says it is concerned by the lack of scrutiny of these alleged violations			1
" this series of grave abuses confirms the concerns that we have been expressing for several weeks , " said the group 's president , @entity155			0
" these acts of revenge together with the extreme tensions that exists between the communities constitute an explosive cocktail leading us to fear that the worst could happen , especially in the context of the reconquering the @entity167			0
" @entity12 rebels who returned to @entity1 well - armed from fighting for the late @entity22 leader @entity21 staged a military coup last year against the @entity1 government			0
@entity173 extremists capitalized on the chaos , carving out a large haven in @entity1 's north and imposing a strict interpretation of @entity179 law			2
the @entity173 banned music , smoking , drinking and watching sports on television			0
they also destroyed historic tombs and shrines			0
fellow rights group @entity187 also has voiced concern over the actions of @entity1 's army			1
" particularly troubling is that among the @entity1 forces -- as well as pro-government militia -- are individuals who enjoy impunity for egregious human rights violations , " wrote @entity191 , managing director of @entity192 and response at @entity194 last week			1
among other abuses , an @entity194 report last year accused the @entity1 army of " indiscriminately " bombing the civilian population in response to the rebellion by armed @entity13 groups			2
more signs @entity34 in @entity1 orchestrated @entity209 attack @entity210 , who heads @entity211 in @entity212 , told @entity2 on thursday that education could help stem the " worrying number of reprisal killings			1
" " [ it ] should be a wake - up call not only to the @entity1 army to nip this problem in the bud and investigate and hold those responsible , but also to @entity1 's international partners -- the @entity18 , the @entity223 , the @entity68 forces who are coming in -- to acknowledge the weaknesses and problems within the @entity1 security forces , and then , to properly accompany them , to urgently train them in international humanitarian law and to mentor them so there are no further abuses in the future , " @entity210 said			1
a @entity2 crew in @entity1 has heard anecdotal reports of abuses			0
it has encountered widespread hatred of the @entity13 in @entity1 , with many in the population blaming them for bringing the current conflict into @entity1			2
the @entity2 crew has heard reports that the houses and possessions of @entity13 families have been destroyed by either citizens or @entity1 's military			1
many @entity13 are in hiding or keeping a low profile for fear of retribution from the public and military			0
tuareg in refugee camps have repeatedly said they had to flee @entity1 because of violence against them			0
@entity18 's involvement in @entity1 began the day after militants said january 10 that they had seized the city of @entity263 , east of @entity264 in central @entity1 , and were poised to advance south toward @entity0			1
those events stoked fear among global security experts that @entity1 could become a new hub for terrorism			0
the @entity92 is a multinational human rights body made up of 164 groups across the world , with delegations at the @entity274 in @entity275 , the @entity223 in @entity276 and the @entity277 in the @entity278			2
@entity2 's @entity280 reported from @entity1 and @entity281 from @entity282 , @entity279 reported from @entity41 , and @entity283 wrote in @entity284			2
