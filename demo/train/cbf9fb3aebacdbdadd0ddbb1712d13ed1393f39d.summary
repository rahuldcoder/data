this week , i will campaign for gov. @entity1			1
i believe this election will and should be about moving @entity3 back from the edge of the abyss on which we stand , where our debt and spending threaten to overwhelm and drown us			1
@entity1 's belief in free markets , limited government and trade make him the clear choice to lead our country come january			1
i do not , however , support a call for intervention in @entity18			1
and , if such intervention were being contemplated , it is absolutely necessary that @entity21 give any such authority to the president			2
no president , @entity25 or @entity26 , has the unilateral power to take our nation to war without the authority of the legislature			0
at times , i have been encouraged by @entity1 's foreign policy			1
i agree with his call to end the war in @entity37 sooner rather than later and with his skepticism of , and call for reform in , foreign aid , but i am a bit dismayed by his foreign policy speech monday , titled " @entity42			1
" @entity1 chose to criticize president @entity43 for seeking to cut a bloated @entity44 and for not being bellicose enough in the @entity45 , two assertions with which i can not agree			1
defense and war spending has grown 137 % since 2001			2
that kind of growth is not sustainable			0
opinion : @entity1 's sorta - kinda call to arms adm. @entity54 stated earlier this year that the biggest threat to our national security is our debt			2
if debt is our gravest threat , adding to the debt by expanding military spending further threatens our national security			0
while i would always stand up for @entity3 and preserve our ability to defend ourselves , a less aggressive foreign policy along with an audit of the @entity44 could save tens of billions of dollars each year without sacrificing our defense			1
to dismiss either idea is to miss the very compromise that will enable us to balance our budget			2
that compromise would be for conservatives to admit that not every dollar spent on the military is sacred or well - spent and for liberals to admit that not every dollar spent on domestic entitlements and welfare is necessary			0
in @entity80 and the @entity45 , our problem has not been a lack of intervention			1
in the past 10 years we have fought two full wars there , and bombed or sent troops into several others			2
this past year , president @entity43 illegally began a war with @entity88 , taking sides with the rebels to unseat an admittedly bad man in @entity92			0
there were several problems with this policy : first , the president did not seek or get the necessary constitutional authority from @entity21 for this military action			0
if our @entity100 is to mean anything it must be applied even in times of war , when those seeking to exercise power do not find it expedient			0
just as importantly , the @entity88 rebels were assisted with virtually no one in the administration or in @entity21 demanding to know who these people were that we were arming and propping up			1
no one seemed to understand that in toppling @entity88 's dictatorship , we were leaving in its wake an unformed , unorganized government without a centralized structure , one that would have a difficult time keeping order among the more than 100 tribes that make up @entity88			0
this " act first , think later " foreign policy has real consequences			1
we 've seen our embassies and consulates stormed in more than one country			0
our diplomats and security team were killed			0
our flag is being burned , our country mocked			0
the proper response to this would be to step back and think of whether we really need to be involved in these countries in the way we have been			0
instead , both parties rush headlong into more places they do n't understand , exemplified monday by @entity1 urging action to arm @entity18 rebels and topple president @entity139			1
but just who are these rebels ? what will they do when in power ? is this really in our vital national interest ? opinion : @entity1 's foreign policy twilight zone we 've been 10 years in @entity37 and we ca n't identify friend from foe			1
do you think we can , with certainty , identify friend and foe in @entity18 ? before taking our country closer to war , should n't we at least ask the viewpoint of the significant @entity159 population in @entity18 ? news reports indicate they are wary of the rebels and are either sitting the fight out or siding with @entity139			1
@entity163 is by no means a saint but @entity159 flocked to @entity18 from a war - torn @entity164 because they feared @entity139 less than the @entity167 government we brought into being			2
before getting deeply involved , should someone ask : are these rebels going to be implementing the death penalty for criticism of @entity167 ? there is ample evidence the rebels are being funded and armed by the most extreme @entity176 elements and governments in the region			0
is that where we want our funds and weapons to end up ? we need to stop and think before we act			0
i am not an isolationist or a pacifist			0
i heartily reject both labels			0
i believe in engagement in the world , with trade , commerce , diplomacy and a foreign policy that projects the greatness of @entity3 and her people			1
i would not hesitate to vote to send @entity3 troops to war to protect our country and our vital national security interests			2
opinion : @entity43 , @entity1 -- ignore @entity37 war at your own peril but we are in too many places , too often , and we do n't seem to even know the reason -- or where we will end up when we 're done			2
this foreign policy has created more enemies than it has vanquished			1
it has siphoned trillions of @entity3 's dollars			2
it has cost tens of thousands of casualties in the loss of the lives and limbs of our soldiers			0
we owe it to ourselves , our soldiers and our children to take a more careful look at our foreign policy , to not rush into war , and to not attempt to score political points with wrongheaded policy ideas			1
follow @ @entity226 on twitter			0

sen. @entity229 : i support @entity1 but question some of his foreign policy speech
he says @entity1 seeks more intervention in @entity45 , where @entity3 wars have fared poorly
@entity229 says arming the rebels in @entity18 risks *empowering* some people with anti- @entity3 *agendas*
he says @entity3 defense budget is too high , growing at *unsustainable* rate
