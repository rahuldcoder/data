-- for many years , i had a pretty good working definition of cool : it was the thing that i was not			1
i was a chubby , bespectacled kid with a bowl haircut and my nose buried in the nearest book			0
when it came time to choose up sides for sports , they assigned me to the team with the best players — as a handicap			0
the cool kids came to school in @entity17 and @entity18			1
i rocked keds and fake @entity21 t - shirts my aunts sent to us from @entity24			0
and that , of course , pointed to the biggest and most insurmountable obstacle standing in the way of my joining the ranks of the cool — the fact that i was one of just four @entity33 kids in my entire school , a tally that included my younger sister			2
the cool kids were all white , except for a handful of black and @entity39 athletes			1
my fellow @entity33 students , meanwhile , were to varying degrees just like me : we were seen as permanently different , always out of sync with the shifting tides of style and status			0
not quite outcast , but never part of the in crowd either			2
so when the phenomenon of @entity33 cool first arrived , i was caught off guard , and frankly , more than a little suspicious			0
when i was in college , @entity53 and @entity55 pop culture were first catching fire at the fringes ; they 'd attracted plenty of enthusiasts , but those fans were no cooler than i was			1
) by the time i was working as a young journalist , i found myself on a beat covering anime and action cinema , j - rock and @entity67 , gadgets and gaming — all things i was personally fascinated by , but could n't quite believe had attracted the attention of the so - called mainstream			0
and i secretly thought that it could n't last			0
the popularity of @entity33 pop culture was a fad , and like all fads would eventually fade			1
i was n't entirely wrong			0
after 1997 and reunification with mainland @entity80 , @entity55 's star ebbed			2
anime and manga remain hugely popular , but have lost the dominant position they once held among youth			0
@entity53 's once unassailable titans of technology — @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 — have seen their products fall out of place as the must - haves among mobile millennials			2
and yet , even as @entity55 and @entity53 have moved out of the centerpoint of cultural cool , another @entity33 nation has stepped into the spotlight : @entity99 — the origin point of @entity101 , " @entity98 , " @entity102 and " @entity103			1
" the surging popularity of @entity106 pop culture can be seen in the booming attendance at @entity108 , the annual @entity110 - based gathering for fans of @entity106 music , tv and cinema , which opens its doors this weekend at the @entity116			1
" our numbers have doubled each year , " says @entity117 , chief marketing officer of the event 's organizer , the @entity121 subsidiary of @entity106 entertainment giant @entity122			2
" we had 10,000 fans at the first @entity108 , 20,000 in 2013 , and expect 30 , around 40,000 to 50,000 persons overall enjoying the @entity108 experience this year " — which includes the appearance of major tv drama stars , a head - to - head pro gaming throwdown , a talent contest called @entity131 and a concert featuring chart - busting idols @entity102 and @entity134 as headliners			2
but even if @entity99 is the king of pop - culture cool now , can @entity99 hold onto the crown better than its @entity33 predecessors ? that 's a question @entity140 addresses in her new book , " the birth of @entity143 : how @entity144 is conquering the world through @entity146			1
" " i think it can , " she says			0
" the difference between cool @entity99 and earlier @entity33 pop culture waves is that @entity99 has been working to make this happen for almost two decades			1
@entity99 is cool because it decided to be cool — it 's the first country in history that has made being cool a massive policy priority , backed by the @entity106 government to the tune of billions of dollars			1
" the fact is , the machine of @entity106 pop culture is as sleekly designed , systematically engineered and massively marketed as any @entity101 gadget			1
it 's not just a gigantic money - making industry , it 's also the primary source of " soft power " by which the nation seeks to shorten its path from war - torn , third - world country to the top ranks of world influencers			0
" @entity170 have a deep - seated desire to see the nation recognized and validated , " @entity169 says			0
" we study harder than anyone in the world , we work more hours , and it 's all because of this need to see us finally come on top			0
" @entity53 cool is quirky , the sum of the nation 's eccentricities			2
@entity55 cool is frenetic , representative of the society 's freewheeling striving spirit			2
@entity121 cool is casual : it 's cool that 's anchored in doing without trying , it 's about being quintessentially effortless			0
by contrast , @entity106 cool could not be more effort - ful			1
the hypnotic appeal of k - pop videos are not just their candy - colored , otherworldly aesthetic , it 's also because their performers — sometimes numbering in the dozens — are invariably dancing in perfect sync , with a level of precision possible only because candidates for k - pop glory are recruited as adolescents and trained for years in groups that are required to live , take classes , eat , sleep and rehearse together until they 've achieved a transcendent level of harmony			1
it all underscores the fact that the rise of @entity106 cool was hardly an accident — and that it could well have staying power			1
@entity121 pop is often seen by nations around the world as an invading force , crushing native alternatives with the unfair - to - the - point - of - being - weaponized scale of its marketing budgets			0
@entity106 cool , by contrast , is recognized as the product of hard work and ingenuity , developed by a nation that just a few generations ago was newly bisected by war and mired in desperate poverty			1
in the fastest - growing markets in the world — @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , the @entity237 — k - pop is aspirational in part because it holds out hope that they , too , will someday be able to join the ranks of the global economy 's cool kids			1
which means that lifelong nerds like myself might not be a completely lost cause , either			0
back to practicing my precision dance routines .			0

@entity251 : for many years , i was never one of the cool kids , part of the in crowd
@entity251 : i was *surprised* when @entity53 and @entity55 pop culture became popular
he says @entity99 is now hot -- with k - pop , @entity101 , " @entity103 , " movies
@entity251 : latest @entity106 cool can be sampled at @entity108 this weekend in @entity116
