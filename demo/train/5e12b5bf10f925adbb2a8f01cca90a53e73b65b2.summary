@entity0 -- @entity3 military experts sunday worked around the clock to examine the remains of a mysterious drone that was shot down after penetrating @entity3 airspace from the @entity8			1
the @entity3 military announced saturday that the unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down over the northern @entity11			1
they say the drone did not take off from @entity14 , leading them to consider the possibility that it originated in @entity18			1
@entity3 security experts point the finger at @entity3 's longstanding rival @entity21 , the @entity22 militia based in southern @entity18			1
" we know it originated in @entity18 , " said @entity23 , an @entity3 national security and defense commentator for @entity3 news portal @entity26			1
" it is entirely clear the @entity30 was sent by an @entity32 proxy			0
the @entity32 provided @entity21 with their very first drones and they have also funded the organization			0
" opinion : @entity37 drone monopoly gone while @entity3 has yet to officially announce who it sees as responsible for the penetration into its airspace , @entity18 's national news agency on sunday reported that @entity3 fighter jets have flown into @entity18 airspace , causing sonic booms in the area			1
military spokeswoman @entity46 said saturday that the drone did not carry any weapons or explosives			0
@entity46 would not discuss the drone 's route or whether it had flown over military installations			0
if @entity21 were responsible for the launch of the drone , flying it for more than 200 km ( 125 miles ) down the @entity8 and deep into @entity3 , that would represent a significant upgrade to its aerial capacities			2
but @entity23 said neither @entity21 nor the @entity60 militant groups @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity14 have claimed responsibility for launching the drone			0
" i can imagine they are quiet , concerned of the @entity3 response to this operation , but it is not for me to say what @entity3 's reaction would be , " he said			1
@entity32 , which supports @entity21 , has had no comment			0
while the @entity3 military has stated that the drone did not carry explosives , the objective of the flight was a mystery sunday			2
" the question is , what exactly did they look to achieve ? was it merely a demonstration of strength , or an operational mission for collecting intelligence ? " said @entity23			0
one possible target for any of @entity3 's enemies is the secret nuclear plant at @entity89 , in the @entity11			1
built with the help of the @entity93 government in the 1960s , the reactor stands several dozen miles from where the drone was shot down			1
@entity3 does not comment on whether it has nuclear weapons , but details leaked by a former technician at @entity89 in the 1980s led international observers to conclude that it could have produced as many as 200 nuclear bombs			1
in december 2010 , the @entity3 military announced it had shot down an unidentified flying object over the nuclear plant			1
@entity23 said crashing a drone carrying explosives onto the plant would be considered a phenomenal achievement for @entity21 , even though the aircraft ca n't carry a big enough bomb to inflict serious damage			2
even photographs of the tightly guarded plant would be an intelligence prize , he said			0
the drone incident comes amid a tense international standoff over @entity32 's nuclear fuel program , which @entity3 fears is a cover for a nuclear weapons program			1
@entity32 has defied calls by the @entity121 to halt its production of enriched uranium , insisting it has a right to make fuel for civilian power plants			0
but the @entity121 nuclear watchdog agency says it can no longer verify that @entity32 nuclear research is strictly peaceful			0
that 's fueled talk of @entity3 military action against @entity32 , with @entity3 prime minister @entity132 warning the @entity133 in september that time for a diplomatic solution was running out			2
the @entity37 , @entity3 's leading ally , says it wo n't tolerate a nuclear - armed @entity32 , but says diplomatic and economic sanctions are starting to take a deep bite out of @entity32 's economy			1
on sunday , @entity46 , the @entity3 military spokeswoman , said an @entity3 warplane shot down the drone			2
@entity23 said small drones are difficult to spot on radar , and missiles are n't designed to hit such slow - moving targets			0
the decision to closely follow the drone for almost 30 minutes within @entity3 airspace was a wise choice , @entity23 said			2
" having identified the drone flying over the @entity8 , the @entity3 air force could have chosen to shoot it down right away , " he said			0
" the ability to track the drone , take pictures of it from all directions and examine its capabilities serves as an outstanding resource for intelligence information			0
" anti-drone peace march halted in @entity160			0

" we know it originated in @entity18 , " an @entity3 security *analyst* says
@entity3 is *investigating* the craft 's origin and has n't pointed any fingers yet
the drone was shot down over @entity3 's @entity11 on saturday
the craft was several dozen miles from the top - secret @entity89 nuclear plant
