@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 @entity3 sought to silence the teenage education activist @entity4 by shooting her in the head			1
they 're also trying to stifle the widespread criticism of the attack in the news media by threatening journalists in @entity1			1
the militant group 's menacing statements have intensified fears among reporters in a country that is already one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist			1
the attack on @entity4 , 14 , in the northwestern district of @entity22 last week has left her battling to recover from her injuries in a hospital in @entity26 and generated a wave of shock and anger in @entity1 and around the world			1
girl shot alongside @entity4 haunted by the attack the @entity3 quickly claimed responsibility for the act , but they did n't appear to have anticipated the level of revulsion and condemnation that it would provoke			1
thousands of people joined in rallies across @entity1 in support of the wounded teen , and calls grew for a strong response from the government			2
as coverage of the shooting -- and the appalled reaction to it -- swept across the @entity1 and international news media , the @entity3 began issuing lengthy statements trying to justify the targeting of @entity4 , who had defied them by insisting on the right of girls to go to school			1
they also complained that " this filthy , godless media has taken huge advantage of this situation , and journalists have started passing judgment on us , " raising the prospect of killing those journalists			1
who are the @entity1 @entity3 ? reporters in northwestern @entity1 , the region where the @entity3 are active , say they have been alerted by authorities of an increased risk to their security and some of them have received warnings that they are being specifically targeted			1
" things after @entity4 have become more tense , as the @entity3 is very angry with the way the attack was reported , " said a veteran journalist in @entity71 , the main city in the restive northwestern region near the border with @entity74			1
" we are scared , but what can we do ? we have to work			0
" the journalist , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals , noted that factions of the @entity3 had killed and abducted other journalists in the past because they were unhappy with their coverage			2
@entity89 , the executive director of the @entity90 , a trade body of publishers , said the organization had requested extra security from the government to protect its members ' operations and staff in light of the @entity3 statements			2
the militants ' threats against journalists for covering an attack for which they had unabashedly claimed responsibility may seem contradictory			0
but it goes to the heart of the @entity3 's approach , according to @entity109 , @entity1 researcher for the human rights group @entity110			1
attack on @entity1 schoolgirl galvanises @entity114 feeling " the underlying thing to understand is the @entity3 only have one modus operandi : violence , " said @entity109 , who is based in @entity26 but travels to @entity1 regularly			1
" they use it to intimidate people and coerce them into doing what they want			0
" he said that some of the local journalists he had spoken to in northwestern @entity1 -- including in @entity123 , the main town in the @entity22 where @entity4 's family lives -- were " very shaken " by the @entity3 threats and had asked him to pray for them			1
" these people have families and children , " he said			0
" part of their job is going out into the field -- they do n't have luxury of leaving the country " like foreign journalists			0
despite the risks , the @entity4 story is still " actively being taken up by the press " and journalists are " doing their duty , " @entity89 of the newspaper society said			2
that role is all the more significant in a part of the world caught amid various geopolitical riptides			0
the volatile area southwest of @entity71 , along the porous border between @entity1 and @entity74 , is a base for extremist groups , the focus of the controversial @entity150 drone strike program and the scene of clashes between @entity1 security forces and militants			0
@entity4 : a global symbol but still just a kid much of it has become a no - go area for reporters , especially those from @entity166 news organizations , but some local journalists still venture into risky areas			2
" if we do n't have these people doing this job , we wo n't know what 's happening , " said @entity109			0
" when conflicts are fought away from the media lens , that increases the scope for abuses			0
" the dangers that journalists already face in @entity1 are well documented			2
more journalists were killed there than in any other country in both 2010 and 2011 , according to the @entity182 ( @entity182 ) , a group based in @entity183 that promotes press freedom around the world			0
" many of those who died in targeted killings had first been warned to be silent , " the group said in a blog post on its website			0
threats can come not just from militants , but also from government agencies , the @entity182 said			0
" it 's really tough being a journalist in @entity1 , especially on the front line where they are under constant pressure from the @entity3 , the state and even political parties , " said @entity109 , who worked as a reporter in the country for four years			1
" it 's a very politicized environment			0
" @entity1 teen inspires others to fight for education			0

" we are scared , but what can we do ? " a @entity1 reporter says
the @entity3 have threatened journalists following the shooting of @entity4
they say the journalists are " passing judgment " on them
