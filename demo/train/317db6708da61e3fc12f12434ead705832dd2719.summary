-- in his bid to replicate @entity4 's unprecedented success at @entity5 , @entity6 has a secret weapon -- a gold medal - winning water polo player			1
in front of a crowded press room , and in fluent @entity12 , @entity6 outlined his pride at taking control of the recently - crowned @entity16 champions on monday			2
earlier this year @entity5 surprised the football world by announcing @entity6 would replace @entity18 as the club 's coach for the 2013 - 14 football season , with the @entity21 subsequently going on to clinch an historic @entity16 , @entity22 and @entity24 treble			1
and as he attempts to match the success the club enjoyed under @entity18 , @entity6 will have @entity27 at his side , a man who worked with the new @entity5 coach at @entity4 and who won @entity33 gold at the @entity34			1
" he has participated in many @entity33 , " said @entity6			2
" i like to take his influences from other sports , he will help us			0
" as well as @entity27 , @entity6 has brought three other members of his backroom staff from his @entity4 days -- assistant coach @entity40 , scout and video analyst @entity41 and fitness coach @entity42 , " it 's great that these people were willing to follow me , " added @entity6			1
" this is a challenge also for the families , i hope that we manage it well			0
" @entity6 forged his reputation at @entity4 , where he won 14 trophies in four years , including two @entity16 cups , between 2008 and 2012 before deciding to take a sabbatical from the sport			1
his achievements in @entity54 , and the style in which @entity4 achieved success , made the former midfielder one of the most sought after coaches in the world			2
but @entity5 's heritage -- the club has been crowned champions of @entity63 on five occasions -- tempted @entity6			1
" the decision to come to the club was based on its history and its players , " continued @entity6			2
" it 's a fresh challenge for me , my time in @entity4 was wonderful , but i needed a new challenge			0
" @entity5 gave me the opportunity , i am prepared to give my best			0
" having spent the majority of his career with @entity4 , @entity6 is aware of the pressure that comes with working for one of the world 's biggest clubs			1
" at the top clubs , you are always under pressure but i believe in myself and i accept this challenge without a problem , " said the 42 - year - old			0
" i will , of course , make changes , but i want to keep the level that @entity5 has already achieved			0
" @entity6 also spoke in glowing terms of @entity18 , who has announced he will not be taking a coaching role for the new season			1
" i have had no contact with @entity18 but i hope to speak with him in the next few days , " added @entity6			1
" i have a lot of respect for his achievements and it would be good to have his opinion			0
it 's an honor to be his successor , especially after the way his team played last season			0
" earlier on monday , @entity107 coach @entity106 suggested the biggest task facing @entity6 will be to impose his brand of football onto the @entity12 champions			2
" his ( @entity6 's ) challenge is to transport his ( possession football ) paradigm to another culture , " said former @entity112 and @entity113 manager @entity106			0
" it 's like what i tried to do at @entity113 : it 's counter cultural			0
