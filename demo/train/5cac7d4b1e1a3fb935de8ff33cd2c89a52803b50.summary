listen to how loud tea party forces are this week and it will remind you of a valuable lesson : for some conservatives , the 2014 wins are likely to translate into more disappointment -- not more power			0
the big issue -- and the last big act of the current @entity9 -- is whether lawmakers will pass a spending bill that keeps the government running well into 2015			1
some tea party activists insist it is their duty to deny president @entity16 any funding that would help him implement what they call amnesty -- meaning the administration 's recent executive actions on illegal immigration			1

@entity42 , this week , are set to fund @entity16 's amnesty plan with the help of @entity45			1
if you want to stop amnesty , you must flood the offices of members of congress with phone calls			0
there 's no other way			0
they need to hear from you and that you demand they keep their promises			0
" it 's the kind of talk that in the past has put @entity60 on thin ice -- and remember we did have a brief government shutdown not all that long ago because he could not corral -- and control -- the @entity66 forces			1
might that happen again now ? the @entity33 leadership says " no " -- and emphatically so			2
house speaker @entity60 and @entity70 @entity33 leader @entity69 -- who will be majority leader in a month -- say @entity33 can not shut down the government as a way of making policy points			1
and they say they begin the week confident they have the votes to prove the @entity66 forces may be loud , but cant win			0
related : @entity33 aims to avoid shutdown there will be more republicans in both the @entity45 and @entity70 come january			2
so why are tea party forces so frantic about the votes this week ? remember , the @entity33 establishment candidates won most of the contested @entity33 primaries this year , part of what @entity84 openly called his bid to " crush " the tea party			0
that 's why more republicans in @entity92 next year will not translate into more tea party votes in the big internal @entity33 battles			0
so while it would be wrong to consider this week the @entity66 's last stand -- its forces promise to regroup and recover -- the last big act of the old @entity9 is going to be very important in setting the tone for the new @entity9			0
the spending votes will establish just how strong @entity60 and @entity84 are in dealing with the internal @entity33 rifts that have been so messy in recent years			2

lawmakers are getting *closer* to a an *agreement* to fund the government through *september* 2015
@entity66 conservatives want to use the spending bill to force president @entity16 to call off his immigration executive action
but @entity33 leaders are wary of using the *threat* of another government shutdown
