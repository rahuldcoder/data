-- in march , single mother @entity1 , destitute and effectively homeless , was arrested on charges of leaving her children in her car during a 40 - minute job interview			1
the children were unharmed , but @entity1 then faced two counts of third - degree felony child abuse -- charges that sparked outrage across the country			1
it sparked outrage with me as well , and i 've worked with @entity1 's attorney to help handle the media attention surrounding the case			1
my involvement in the story opened my eyes to a number of cases where parents have been arrested for behavior that , just a generation ago , may have raised eyebrows but would certainly not have risen to the level of criminal charges			1
for example : in a split decision this month , an appellate court in @entity31 upheld the conviction of @entity34 , who served a year in jail for two counts of aggravated manslaughter of a child following the drowning deaths of her children , aged 6 and 3			0
@entity34 left her children unsupervised while she went to work at her second - shift job			1
during that time , her children tragically drowned in a neighbor 's pool			0
@entity43 , a @entity44 mother , found herself under arrest this month when a bystander discovered her 9 - year - old daughter playing in the park alone			1
@entity49 had been allowing the girl to play there while she worked at a @entity52 's a mile and a half away			1
here are some more recent examples : in @entity57 , a mother was arrested after leaving her 5 - and 11 - year - olds alone for 2Â½ hours			1
a @entity60 mother was arrested when her 7 - year - old , who was n't wearing a helmet , suffered head injuries after falling off his scooter			2
in @entity66 , a mother died in jail while serving a 48 - hour sentence after she could n't pay fines incurred for the truancy of some of her seven children			0
in @entity75 , a father was arrested when his 8 - year - old gave the church bus the slip and played with neighborhood friends instead of going to youth group			2
and then just this week , a mother in @entity31 was arrested after allowing her 7 - year - old to walk half a mile to a neighborhood park			2
the boy even had a cell phone to call home if he got into trouble			2
what 's going on here ? from one perspective , we 're criminalizing poverty			2
some of the parents i mentioned above clearly acted out of economic necessity			2
in our post-recession economy , good jobs are hard to come by and child care is expensive			0
for low - wage earners , child care costs can easily eclipse earning potential			0
in @entity1 's case , she had previously been offered a full - time job , but child care costs would have left her with less income than she was able to earn by picking up a few hours here and there			1
a news report in the @entity49 case quoted another parent who said , " i understand the mom may have been in a difficult situation , not having someone to watch the child , but at the same time , you 've got to find somebody			2
" it sounds as though she is suggesting that having some unqualified person to stay home alone with the daughter would somehow be better than letting her play in the park , surrounded by other children and parents			1
i 'm not a parent , but i am a board - certified family law attorney , and i frequently deal with families facing difficult decisions			0
the truth is that too many parents are finding themselves having to make a desperate choice between providing for their children and caring for their children			2
unless you 've been put in that situation , i do n't think you 're entitled to judge			0
i grew up in @entity135 in the ' 60s -- during a time when crime in @entity139 was notoriously on the rise			1
my father was a battalion chief for the @entity142 , and he worked two other jobs to support our family			0
my mother worked hard to keep my two sisters , my two brothers ( and me ) in line			0
she was an amazing mother but did n't always succeed in keeping us out of hot water			0
we were allowed to play unsupervised in our neighborhood , and sometimes we got in trouble			2
but my mother knew we were with other neighborhood kids			0
she knew other adults in our neighborhood kept tabs on us and would look out for us			0
she expected that if we got into real trouble , we 'd encounter a police officer , and that officer would deliver us home -- and it did happen from time to time			1
i 'm concerned that in the average neighborhood today -- where the crime rate is far lower than it was in the 1960s -- adults are not looking out for neighborhood kids			1
instead of helping a youngster who may be in trouble , they 're calling the cops			0
and the police , instead of bringing children home , they 're handing them over to child services and arresting the parents			1
last week , prosecutors offered @entity1 a deal : after she completes a parenting plan , which includes six months of counseling , they will drop the felony charges			0
but @entity1 now has to fight to regain custody of her children			0
in @entity44 , @entity49 has been reunited with her daughter but still faces criminal prosecution , and she lost her job as a result of the arrest			1
in @entity31 , @entity34 is out of jail now -- after suffering the double tragedy of losing her children and enduring incarceration for her role in the misfortune			0
elsewhere other children are being taken from their parents , and families are being torn apart			0
i have to wonder if my mom , who i think was a wonderful mother , would face criminal charges if she were alive and raising children in today 's world -- if she raised them the way she raised my brothers and sisters and me .			1

@entity206 : in march , homeless mom arrested after leaving kids in car during job interview
arrest drew outrage -- one among many recently in which parents left kids while at work
he says poverty being criminalized and neighbors used to help but now just call police
@entity206 says his mom let him play *unattended* as kid in @entity139 but today she 'd be arrested
