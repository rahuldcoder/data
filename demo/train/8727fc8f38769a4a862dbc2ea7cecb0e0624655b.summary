for the first time , the @entity0 approved legislation that would protect gay , lesbian and transgender employees from discrimination in the workplace			1
the @entity8 , or @entity8 , passed the @entity10 - led chamber on thursday , 64 to 32			0
ten @entity11 joined 52 @entity10 and two independents in supporting the bill			1
four senators did not vote			0
@entity16 sens. @entity15 and @entity17 became the latest @entity11 members to support the measure			2
they joined sens. @entity21 of @entity22 , @entity23 of @entity24 , @entity25 of @entity26 , @entity27 of @entity28 , @entity29 of @entity30 , @entity31 of @entity32 , @entity33 of @entity34 , and the bill 's co-sponsor , @entity37 of @entity38			2
" the workplace is simply no place for discrimination , " @entity39 said before the vote			1
opposition in the @entity11 - controlled @entity45 is strong , minimizing any chance the measure will become law			1
house speaker @entity49 also opposes it			0
still , president @entity51 urged the @entity45 to take the bill up and said he would sign it			1
" one party in one house of @entity57 should not stand in the way of millions of @entity59 who want to go to work each day and simply be judged by the job they do , " the president said in a statement			0
" now is the time to end this kind of discrimination in the workplace , not enable it			2
i urge the @entity45 @entity11 leadership to bring this bill to the floor for a vote and send it to my desk so i can sign it into law			1
" the bill would provide the same protections for @entity77 workers as are already guaranteed on the basis of race , gender and religion			1
it would not be lawful for employers to discriminate based on a person 's " actual or perceived " sexual orientation or gender identity			0
@entity38 legislature oks same - sex marriage @entity8 's path began in earnest in 1994 , the first time it was introduced in @entity57			2
two years later , a version that only protected sexual orientation - and not gender identity - nearly passed the @entity0 but failed by one vote			1
the issue was not brought up again for a vote until 2007 when the @entity45 passed the narrower version			1
in 2009 , an ailing sen. @entity100 , @entity101 , wanted to make sure the issue did n't fall by the wayside			0
just months before he died , @entity100 asked newly elected sen. @entity104 , @entity105 , to take the reins			0
eventually , @entity104 approached @entity37 to help him get the measure passed			0
sexual orientation and @entity8 : how we got here @entity37 voted for it while in the @entity45 and has been a co-sponsor			2
the two lawmakers lobbied colleagues , leading to thursday 's @entity0 vote			1
@entity104 remembered @entity100 's passion for the legislation , quoting him before final @entity0 action : " the promise of @entity59 will never be fulfilled as long as justice is denied to even one among us			2
" but the measure 's path could end in the @entity0 this year as the @entity11 - led @entity45 appears unlikely to take it up			1
" the speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost @entity59 jobs , especially small business jobs , " @entity49 's spokesman , @entity124 , said			0
@entity130 , president of the @entity77 activist group @entity131 , had harsh words for @entity49			2
" the speaker , of all people , should certainly know what it 's like to go to work every day afraid of being fired			0
instead of letting the far right trample him again , it 's time for speaker @entity49 to stand with the majority of everyday @entity11 voters and support @entity8 , " @entity130 said earlier this week			1
regardless proponents are applauding @entity0 action			2
" equality means equality in the workplace , as much as anywhere else in our lives , " said @entity146 , trial partner and partner - in - charge of @entity148 at international law firm @entity149			0
opinion : it 's ' way past time ' for gay rights law opponents say @entity8 will have " a chilling effect on free speech as well as religious liberty " by requiring secular businesses who have a moral objection to @entity77 people to not discriminate against them			1
efforts to expand the religious protection component of the bill to secular businesses failed			0
the @entity168 says passage of @entity8 would " hurt kids			0
" " @entity173 students in some states are already being confused by transgender teachers , " a fact sheet by the @entity168 read			0
" if @entity8 passes , students and children in daycare centers all across the nation will be subjected to individuals experimenting with their gender identities			0
" twenty - one states currently have laws protecting lesbian and gay workers from discrimination and 17 states protect transgender workers , according to the @entity131 .			1

@entity189 would protect gay , lesbian and transgender employees from workplace discrimination
it 's the first time the @entity0 has passed @entity77 worker protections
@entity45 opposition strong , so chances of it becoming law are slim
