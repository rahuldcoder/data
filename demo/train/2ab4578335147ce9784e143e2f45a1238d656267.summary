-- dear speaker @entity1 , president @entity2 enacted 1,081 executive orders during his presidency			1
and president @entity7 had 291			2
president @entity8 has enacted 182 executive orders -- yet the @entity10 accuses him of being an " imperial president , " and @entity10 members of the @entity13 are preparing to sue him for violating the @entity14			1
with all due respect , speaker @entity1 , it 's as though the fog of extreme partisanship that has colored your dealings with president @entity8 since day one has suddenly turned into a full - on fever of irrationality			1
think about this for just a second : @entity13 @entity10 are using taxpayer dollars to fund a lawsuit against a president who has literally done not only what every president before him has done but has done it less often and is doing so now only because @entity32 repeatedly refuse to even vote on legislation , let alone pass anything			2
and you have the gall to accuse the president of being the one in violation of the @entity14 ? even more frustrating is how your repeated attacks on the president fall factually flat			0
in your essay for @entity0 , you write : " after years of slow economic growth and high unemployment under president @entity8 , they are still asking , ' where are the jobs ? ' " this is a particularly laughable assertion given last week 's jobs report , which noted our economy added 288,000 jobs in june , marking 52 straight months of continuous job growth			1
overall , under president @entity8 's leadership , the private sector has added 9.7 million jobs and an economy that was in free fall when he was elected is now in a steady recovery			1
do n't think that recovery is fast enough , speaker @entity1 ? then pass laws to help rather than jeering from the sidelines and rooting for @entity62 to fail so you can blame it on president @entity8			1
you assert that you have passed jobs bills that president @entity8 and the @entity68 @entity67 are ignoring , but frankly the word " jobs " as you use it there is questionable			2
your " jobs " bills include legislation to repeal @entity73 , through which 20 million @entity62 now have health insurance , cut food stamps for poor @entity62 and reduce government regulations on fracking			0
meanwhile , president @entity8 proposed an actual jobs bill that would have created construction jobs to modernize our deteriorating roads and airports , provided tax credits for employers that hired returning veterans , extended unemployment benefits , which also spurs spending , and cut payroll taxes for 98 % of @entity62 businesses			2
but that jobs bill was killed by @entity10 opposition in @entity94			0
you also accuse president @entity8 of ignoring the law , of acting like " a monarch or king			2
" yet the same article of the @entity14 that vests power and authority in @entity94 vests executive power in the president			0
since the founding of our country , that power has been interpreted to allow presidents to enact executive orders and determine how the duly passed laws of @entity94 should be prioritized and deployed			1
if you 're looking for an example of stretching that authority to the point of breaking it , perhaps you should n't scrutinize a former constitutional law professor but instead his predecessors			0
" i believe in a strong , robust executive authority , " vice president @entity115 said in 2005			0
" the president of the @entity62 needs to have his constitutional powers unimpaired			0
" @entity115 , for instance , described the @entity120 -- in which a president must gain the approval of @entity94 before launching armed conflict -- as an unconstitutional " infringement on the authority of the presidency			0
" in both number and scope , president @entity8 's use of executive actions simply pales against this and other actions one could compare			1
@entity133 , the last president faced with a massive economic recession , ultimately enacted 3,522 executive orders			1
even though his own party controlled both houses of @entity94 , @entity133 was n't sued			0
he was elected to a third term			0
and his policies , including his executive orders , helped rescue @entity62 from the recession			1
in the face of obstructionist @entity10 in @entity94 , president @entity8 's executive actions also enjoy broad public support			1
some 57 % of @entity62 supported his administrative relief for young undocumented immigrants brought to the @entity62 when they were children			0
and according to a poll conducted by the @entity151 advocacy group the @entity148 , 73 % of @entity62 support an executive order to ban discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity			0
if @entity13 @entity10 do n't like these executive orders , then pass immigration reform and the @entity160			1
do n't sue the president			0
passing laws that our nation wants and needs is doing your job			0
suing the president just because you do n't like him is irresponsible partisan petulance			0
speaker @entity1 , you write : " if you look back over @entity62 history , there has always been a tension between the inherent powers of the executive branch versus the inherent powers of the legislative branch			2
" yes , that 's true , and president @entity8 is simply exercising those inherent executive powers			1
now please exercise yours and pass some laws to help @entity62 instead of wasting taxpayer money on a frivolous lawsuit that is nothing more than a flagrant partisan stunt			1
@entity1 : why we must now sue the president			2

@entity187 : @entity8 has issued fewer executive orders than @entity7 or @entity6
@entity1 's actions *smack* of irrational partisanship , she says
she notes that under @entity8 , the economy and jobs are better than after @entity7 free fall
@entity187 : @entity1 's *political* stunt wastes taxpayer money
