-- overshadowed by its bigger , flashier neighbors , @entity1 is a curious country that 's overlooked by visitors who flock to @entity7 destinations like @entity8 , @entity9 and the highlands of the @entity11			1
for those who visit nearby nations , though , @entity1 's subtropical forests , broad rivers and unusual history can make it an intriguing detour			1
surrounded by @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , this landlocked nation is larger than a glance at the map suggests			0
it 's roughly the size of @entity26 but has only about 6.7 million residents , at least 3 million fewer than @entity28			2
taste @entity1 's delicious mistake the @entity30 divides the country into roughly equal halves			1
most of the population lives in the eastern half , about a third of them in the riverside capital city of @entity38			0
to the west , the @entity40 area is a mostly grassy plain , brutally hot in summer , punctuated with marshes , savannas and thorn forests			2
thinly populated with ranchers and @entity48 , the west is also home to @entity52 - speaking @entity51 colonies near the @entity22 border			0
it 's tempting to say that @entity1 is unspoiled by tourists , and that would be true ; most visitors come from neighboring countries , with whom the nation warred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries			1
now , despite ups and downs in the quarter - century since notorious dictator @entity64 fell from power , @entity1 has become a more welcoming place			1
in the absence of mass tourism , it 's a place where closer contact and the lack of preconceptions can lead to memorable , even intimate , experiences at underrated sites			2
arrivals from @entity76 or @entity77 are a relative novelty , to be treated with courtesy and respect			0
here are 14 things to know about this little - known country : @entity83 usted @entity84 ? @entity1 is @entity86 's most bilingual country , as nearly 90 % of all @entity1 speak both @entity88 and indigenous @entity87			1
it is the only country in the region with a large percentage of nonindigenous citizens who speak an indigenous language			1
there are at least a dozen other native languages , but none approaches @entity87 's prevalence			1
an evolving capital @entity1 's sprawling riverside capital , @entity38 , is the hub of its political , commercial and cultural life			1
unlike most of @entity7 's capitals , it 's a relatively low - rise city where shade is at a premium , except on some lushly landscaped plazas			2
it was founded in 1537 , and its grid pattern is typical of the earliest @entity88 settlements , but there are few remaining colonial buildings			1
the most notable structures , such as the government palace and the shrine to those who perished in battle , date from the 19th century			0
the government 's house @entity38 's counterpart to the @entity121 is the @entity122 , a neoclassical building intended for the dynasty that ruled the country for decades in the mid- 19th century			2
the @entity127 family did n't survive the @entity128 , when they foolishly took on @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity130 in a bid to dominate the region			2
still , their political successors have occupied the palace ever since			0
shrine to warriors in downtown @entity38 , protected by an honor guard , the @entity138 is a domed neoclassical shrine housing the remains of the figures who led their country into disastrous conflict with neighboring countries			0
started in the 1860s , before the @entity128 , it was n't finished until 1936 , after the @entity149 with @entity22			2
a couple of unknown soldiers are a token presence			0
picturing diversity @entity1 has a rich indigenous heritage , not just from its @entity87 past and present but also thanks to the smaller but diverse @entity157 populations from the @entity40 region that overlaps western @entity1			1
@entity38 's @entity159 has a strong collection of historic photographs but also displays tools , ceramics and weavings from all regions of the country			2
@entity168 art in its isolation , @entity1 may give the impression of provincialism , but @entity38 has a lively contemporary art scene showcased at many galleries and the @entity174 , which displays avant - garde works by @entity1 , @entity88 and other @entity86 artists under optimum conditions ( no easy feat in this hot , humid climate )			1
the museum also features folk art collections from the 17th century to the present and more strictly indigenous artifacts from @entity1 's native peoples			1
@entity186 lace one of @entity1 's iconic crafts is nanduti , the embroidered lace that probably arrived from the @entity88 island of @entity191			1
the word itself , meaning " spiderweb " in the @entity87 language , aptly describes the weavers ' geometric patterns but not the rainbow of colors that embellish their designs			1
@entity201 a common traditional dish , " @entity1 soup " is n't quite what its name would suggest			1
rather , it 's cornbread flavored with cheese and onion , among other ingredients			2
( check out @entity211 's recipe			0
) legend says its odd moniker stems from a mistake by 19th - century dictator @entity127 's cook , who accidentally added excessive corn flour to a more liquid lunchtime dish			1
fortunately for the cook , @entity127 liked the results			0
@entity221 related to the common holly , cultivated on plantations throughout the region , mate ( pronounced " mahtay " ) or " @entity1 tea " is popular among @entity21 , @entity130 and even southern @entity20 , who imbibe prodigious amounts of their favorite infusion			1
some like it hot , but @entity1 prefer it chilled in the suffocating summer heat			1
an early @entity234 missionary claimed that mate " improves the appetite , speedily counteracts the languor arising from the burning climate , and assuages both hunger and thirst			0
" @entity240 historically , @entity241 are skeptical of the @entity242 and its politicians , but @entity244 is a @entity1 hero			1
after the 19th - century @entity128 against @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity130 , this otherwise obscure @entity242 president awarded the @entity40 -- now more than half of @entity1 's territory -- to @entity38 instead of @entity8			1
both @entity21 and @entity1 sent diplomats to @entity249 for @entity244 ' binding arbitration			2
@entity1 president @entity251 renamed the former town of @entity253 , across the river from @entity38 , in @entity244 ' honor			2
the surrounding county , a school ( with a monument ) and the local soccer team also bear his name			0
( in @entity244 ' hometown of @entity263 , @entity264 , a gas station occupies the site of his birthplace )			0
foundry in the forest @entity269 of @entity38 , recovering subtropical forest blankets the compact and relatively small but verdant @entity271			0
@entity271 offers creekside trails , waterfalls and droves of metallic blue butterflies			0
howler monkeys are harder to spot but easier to hear			0
the park is also a historical site for the iron foundry destroyed by @entity20 forces in the @entity128 , a severe blow to @entity1 's war effort			1
cinematic ruins along the easterly @entity284 , which forms much of the border with @entity20 and @entity21 , 17th - and 18th - century @entity234 evangelists and their @entity84 converts built a string of missions that provided the background for @entity292 's award - winning film " @entity293			0
" best known of the bunch is @entity21 's @entity295 , but @entity1 's @entity296 and @entity297 , near the southern city of @entity299 , are almost equally well - preserved ruins			1
strictly speaking , @entity296 is not a ruin ; rather , it was an incomplete construction when @entity88 expelled the @entity303 from the @entity304 in 1767			2
@entity306 central ? near the " @entity308 " with @entity21 and @entity20 , not far from the famous @entity309 , @entity307 is a chaos of consumerist commerce			0
for street bazaars that barely leave room for a single pedestrian to pass , @entity20 bargain - hunters flock across the bridge for knockoff rolexes and the like			0
one local " businessman , " though , observed that the regional @entity319 common market could mean that " we will no longer be able to live by smuggling products and will have to begin producing things			0
" bruderliebe ? in the vastness of the @entity40 , about 280 miles ( 450 km ) northwest of @entity38 via a paved highway , @entity324 is the administrative center of @entity328 , a settlement of pacifist @entity51 who arrived from the @entity331 in the 1930s			0
of the area 's several @entity51 colonies , this is the most outgoing , especially if @entity52 ( preferably @entity336 or @entity52 ) is your language of brotherly love			0
@entity340 is the author of @entity341 to @entity21 , @entity8 , @entity342 and @entity343 , and the @entity345 guide to @entity21			0
he resides in @entity346 , @entity26 , but spends four to five months every year in southern @entity7 .			0
