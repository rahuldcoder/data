-- @entity2 's ' 90s sitcom " @entity3 " had one of the best tv bromances of our time , but the bond between @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity12 's @entity11 was n't part of the original plan			1
had the production team behind the ' 90s coming - of - age comedy had their way , @entity10 's @entity9 , the precocious middle child of a loving middle - class family , would 've had more male friends instead of his singular bff , @entity12 's floppy - haired @entity11			1
" if you watch the first five episodes , there 's always another kid there and it 's a different kid every episode , " @entity12 , now 33 , recalled in an interview with @entity0			1
" they kept trying to have another best friend , they really wanted @entity9 to have two best friends ... and it just was n't working -- i think they wanted this feeling of ' @entity9 's gang , ' and it just never quite clicked			2
" strong , of course , had already been cast as the mischievous , lady - loving underachiever that became a teen heartthrob , a part that " @entity3 " co-creator @entity43 knew was destined to be the actor 's from his first read			1
but the comedic ( and heartfelt ) magic that was @entity9 and @entity11 's friendship was n't as obvious			1
and then , around a quarter into that first season , @entity12 was given the opportunity to make @entity11 a bigger character			1
" there was this kid who unfortunately got fired in the middle of the week because it just was n't working , and they gave me all of his lines and just made it @entity9 and @entity11 , " @entity12 said			1
" that same week , @entity57 ( @entity58 ) came in as @entity3			2
that week everything clicked , and we were all like , ' oh , this is the show			0
' " for those who are obsessive about " @entity3 , " which aired from 1993 to 2000 , @entity12 pinpoints this fateful moment as " the episode where @entity10 straightens his hair			1
" as the show stretched on , the " bromance " between @entity10 and @entity12 became part of its foundation , both to the creative team and the stars themselves			2
" as actors , @entity10 and i really clicked , and it 's that kind of connection that you so rarely find with an actor with somebody else , this preternatural connection , " @entity12 said			1
" this confidence that we always had in each other that we would never let each other down as actors			0
it 's still to this day one of the greatest working relationships of my life			0
" @entity92 's best bromances ironically , @entity12 never imagined that he 'd ever make it beyond the pilot , let alone a seventh season			1
when he first landed the gig , the idea of being part of a show for six or seven years seemed like a lifetime			0
in essence , the show has even outlived its own cancellation			0
it 's been 13 years since the series wrapped , but " @entity3 " still airs regularly , and hardcore fans can own the entire series , now on @entity108 as a boxed collection for the first time			1
the passion for the @entity9 family and the characters who floated into their lives has produced a spinoff			0
in 2014 , @entity43 will reunite with @entity10 and @entity117 , whose characters have moved on from being high school sweethearts to parents , for a @entity122 series called " @entity123			0
" although the premise is centered on a new generation , the spinoff is a ca n't - miss for fans of " @entity3			1
" strong does n't currently have an official involvement with " @entity123 , " but he believes that @entity11 will probably show up at some point			2
" i 'm very much in conversation with @entity43 , " said @entity12 who said he is writing and directing , not acting , at the moment			2
if @entity11 were to make an appearance , though , he unfortunately would n't still be wearing his original famed leather jacket			1
strong could n't resist taking the item -- as crucial to @entity11 's character as his long hair -- when he moved to @entity139 after " @entity3 " ended			1
" i stole the jacket from the show -- @entity122 would n't let us take anything , but i had a leather jacket that i had bought on my own , and i swapped it , " @entity12 said			1
ironically , the jacket was eventually stolen from his car , @entity12 said			2
strong has great memories of the set			0
" it was a ridiculously tight group of people			0
... between @entity10 ( @entity154 ) , will ( @entity153 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 ) and me , it was like the goal of everyday became , can we please stop laughing long enough to get through this scene , because we 're having so much fun , " @entity12 said			0
somehow , in the years since they filmed their series finale , the cast has also managed to evade the dreaded @entity163 : post @entity164			0
photos : child star transformations for that , the actor - turned - filmmaker likes to give credit to both his grounded upbringing , and another child star who did n't self - destruct : @entity10 's older brother , " @entity175 ' " @entity154			2
" i always give credit to @entity154 , because he was ahead of us and very close to us but he had been through such a high level of fame , " @entity12 said			0
" by the time we started ' @entity3 , ' he was already going to @entity180			0
there was just this sense of : ' hey , school 's important			0
you do n't have to be the most famous person in the world and make a crapload of money			0
there are more important things in life			0
