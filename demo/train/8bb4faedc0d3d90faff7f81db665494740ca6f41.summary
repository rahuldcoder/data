-- @entity1 coped with soaring gas and food prices sparked by the government 's removal of massive revolutionary - era subsidies as president @entity8 left wednesday for a two - day economic summit in @entity10			1
in the @entity1 capital , @entity12 , police manned gas stations as some cab drivers hiked fares and residents complained about prices going up fourfold for essential items after the government began slashing subsidies to help bolster the @entity24 's sagging oil - based economy			1
the government began its plan to remove subsidies on sunday and deployed security forces to several major gas stations in the capital city , @entity12 , to offset the threat of potential protests			1
in 2007 , protesters torched a dozen gas stations after the government 's abrupt decision to ration monthly fuel allotments			1
the cuts in subsidies are far more severe but the response has been muted			0
@entity1 observers attribute it to a climate of fear following a government crackdown in the aftermath of the 2009 presidential election controversy			1
still , @entity12 residents said the government was beefing up security			1
witnesses saw up to 20 police officers at three major gas stations in central and northern @entity12			1
" i hope enough people will protest these ridiculous changes , but they are scared of the security forces because of the past protests where our citizens were beaten , " said a civil engineer , who like others interviewed by @entity0 did not want to be identified for fear of repercussions			1
" a lot of people are anxious and confused , " said a taxi driver , " they do n't know what 's coming next but they do n't have much choice			0
" but a courier said he did n't have time to protest			0
" they just make prices go higher and life more difficult , " he said			0
by @entity1 's own admission , the subsidies have cost the government around $ 100 billion a year , according to a report on state - run @entity80 this week			1
@entity1 was forfeiting potentially huge revenues , according to the @entity82			2
" with the removal of subsidies on oil and gas , domestic demand for energy in @entity1 is expected to decline , leaving more energy resources available for export			1
if all goes according to plan , the strategy should serve the dual purpose of generating more revenue for the country and curbing the wasteful use of energy , " @entity82 senior economist @entity91 and @entity1 mission chief @entity92 said on the organization 's website			2
adding to @entity1 's economic woes are the effects of blistering international sanctions , imposed for its nuclear program , which @entity1 says it is developing for peaceful purposes but many other nations fear is aimed at producing a weapon			1
on tuesday , the @entity110 announced a new round of sanctions against five @entity1 companies , including two banks and the country 's national maritime carrier , the @entity115			2
the @entity117 says these companies are directly associated with the @entity119			0
both the @entity119 and the shipping line " are major institutional participants in @entity1 's illicit conduct and in its attempts to evade sanctions , " said @entity120 , the @entity117 under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence			1
" we will therefore continue to target and expose their networks			0
" @entity8 is expected to deliver a keynote address at the @entity132 on thursday			0
the group aims to develop economic cooperation among @entity1 , @entity10 , @entity135 and seven other regional nations			1
in erasing the subsidies , @entity8 was keenly aware he was treading on the promises made to the people in the 1979 @entity115 revolution , said @entity1 - @entity117 journalist and author @entity141			1
but the subsidies had become unsustainable and @entity8 had prepared @entity1 for the need to pump more money into the economy			1
" we have been told for many years that subsidies are ruining the economy and must be eliminated , but no government up to now had the determination to actually go ahead and do it , " said a mechanic who gave his name as @entity149			2
around the city , taxi drivers reacted to the cuts differently			0
one said he has raised his rates for rides			0
" when gasoline prices almost double , my fares should also double , " he said			0
but another said his company told him not to charge riders extra			0
despite the rise in gasoline prices to as much as 7,000 rials ( 70 cents ) a liter , the driver said that if he makes up to eight trips a day in his taxi , he will make up the difference in the higher price of gasoline			0
@entity1 's gas rationing program previously allowed people to buy up to 50 liters per month at around 10 cents a liter , far below what they or people anywhere else would pay on the world market			2
now , @entity1 are paying at least four times that -- 40 cents per liter for the first 50 liters each month and 70 cents above that			2
@entity1 has $ 10 trillion in oil resources alone , plus natural gas reserves worth between $ 3.5 trillion and $ 4.5 trillion , the @entity82 has said			2
but its economy nonetheless has seen lackluster growth , including between 1 % and 2 % of gdp this past year			0
while gas prices will affect the middle and upper echelons of society , what is most worrying to others are rising prices for food			0
working class @entity1 will pay as much as 10 times more for bread			2
the government is paying $ 800 for two months for people who registered for help in buying bread at the higher prices			0
@entity0 's @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
