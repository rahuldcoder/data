-- @entity2 's nicknames : " @entity3 , " " @entity2 , " " mr. november			1
" -- baseball - reference.com i do n't know anybody who calls @entity2 either " @entity2 " or " mr. november			1
" * * this week begins " what can only be called @entity9 in @entity10			1
" -- a story from @entity12 i do n't know anybody who has called this @entity9 in @entity10			1
* * " how should @entity14 in his last game at @entity16 ? " -- a headline from @entity18 uh , i do n't know ... on foot ? * * @entity2 , baseball player , is not nearly as big a deal as a lot of @entity22 think he is			1
i know people with no clue how big he is			2
" how tall would you guess @entity2 is ? " i asked a baseball fan from @entity28 " hmmm , " she said			1
" five - foot - 10 ? " no , he is 6 - foot - 3			2
everything else you 've ever wanted to know about @entity2 , you could be about to find out			1
tv , radio , blogs , magazines , newspapers			2
smartphones and carrier pigeons based in @entity22 are treating this , @entity2 's last week of playing @entity10 , as slightly less monumental than the discovery of @entity41 in 1492			1
@entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity41 and crunch are just a few of the @entity48 now considered by many @entity22 to be not as big as theirs			1
but you know what ? @entity52 are n't obsessing over these being @entity2 's last days of playing ball			1
@entity54 or @entity55 or @entity56 or @entity57 , either			2
i mean , they like him and all			2
a really fine guy , too , it seems			2
a class act , people in and out of baseball tend to agree			2
should a fuss be made over his retirement ? of course			2
a warm sendoff definitely is in order			2
a standing @entity73 lovely parting gift			0
a tip of thousands of caps			0
a wobble of thousands of bobbleheads			0
but , man oh man , is @entity22 going completely wacko overboard or what ? i expect any minute for the mayor there -- what 's his name , the tall guy who came after @entity87 -- to announce that a certain other tall piece of work is being renamed the @entity90			1
it would n't surprise me if future @entity93 commuters come to town through the @entity95 or catch a helicopter at @entity97			0
i have booked a flight east for 2015 that probably will include a connection at @entity100			0
they 've done everything in @entity22 except stage a new @entity104 version of " @entity105 " in which @entity107 's team loses because a young @entity2 wants to be a @entity108 so much , he sells his soul to the devil			1
or a new version of " @entity112 , " now that he 's leaving , with the lyrics changed to : " we love you , @entity2 , oh , yes we do ! we love you , @entity2 , and we 'll be true			1
when you 're not near to us , we 're blue			0
oh , @entity2 , we love you ! " @entity41 sports fans from @entity119 to @entity120 are not stricken with this @entity2 - mania the way @entity22 are			1
he 's big , but not that big			2
a lot of @entity123 and @entity124 would n't know @entity2 from @entity125			1
did he have a great career ? no doubt about it			0
opinion : @entity10 's humble hero if you know your baseball , you must be impressed that @entity2 has had more hits in his career than @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 or @entity139 did			1
a bat stat i like , for the amusement or amazement of you baseball lovers out there , is this one : @entity2 already has more hits than @entity147 and @entity148 did combined			1
for the past 20 years , the shortstop for the @entity108 , the most successful organization in @entity41 baseball , has been a kid who played his high school ball in @entity153 , @entity154 , on his way to fame and fortune in the big city			1
in most of the @entity41 , baseball fans seem to consider @entity2 a great player			1
in the largest city in the @entity41 , baseball fans seem to consider @entity2 a visitor from the planet @entity165			1
well , to each his own			0
no one anywhere would dare argue that @entity2 is undeserving , or overrated , or " maybe " a @entity167			1
on the contrary , this guy is a rarity in this day and age , a certain @entity167			0
i met him , interviewed him , liked him			0
one day in 2008 , i got him for a while in @entity175 one - on - one			0
we were chatting about the @entity16 under construction , a work in progress , and @entity2 said enthusiastically : " it 'll look just like the old one , except with 500,000 more feet of space			1
" i remember saying @entity182 ought to think the same way			0
" exactly , " @entity2 said			1
i later asked @entity184 , a successful @entity185 shortstop and manager , what he thought of @entity100			0
" the perfect man , " he replied			0
oh ? in what way ? " @entity2 has everything in life , " @entity184 said			1
" he 's got money , he 's got rings , he 's ...			2
" a pause before the punchline			0
" that got a laugh			0
" too bad i do n't have a daughter , " @entity184 added			0
the off - the - field life of @entity2 brought a smile to our faces that day , as the on - the - field one has to many since			1
he 's been a @entity108 his whole professional life			1
he was drafted in june , 1992 -- @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 picked first but took somebody else -- and made his @entity10 debut in a may 29 , 1995 , indoor game before a " crowd " of 18,948 fans in @entity214 , batting ninth in the @entity108 lineup that day			1
@entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 were in the infield with him			0
he went 0 - for - 5 and the @entity108 lost			2
thousands of hits later , @entity2 is retiring and his uniform number 2 will be put out to pasture as well			2
( a guy named @entity224 was the last yankee to wear it before him			0
) those hits include a walk - off home run that won @entity227 4 of the @entity228 on a @entity229 night			0
it came after midnight , therefore technically becoming the first @entity232 homer ever struck in the month of november			0
he became " mr. november " to somebody that night , a name absolutely nobody has known him by since			0
" @entity240 " is what @entity108 fans do call him			1
a promotion to admiral could be in order			0
thursday is his last scheduled game at @entity16			0
a weekend of games in @entity247 follows that , and that 's that			2
admirable player , admirable career			0
@entity252 , top of the heap			0
not that big a deal ? ok , ok , so maybe he is even bigger than some of us think			0
join us on @entity260 / @entity259 .			0

@entity262 : @entity22 are treating retirement of @entity2 as monumental event
he says sports fans around the *nation* may not be as sold on the *momentous* *occasion*
but how good was @entity2 ? he 's a lock for the @entity270 , amazing stats and *performance* , he says
@entity262 : @entity10 will miss the @entity108 *captain*
