one member of the esteemed group feels like a " proverbial potted plant , " while another resents sitting there " looking stupid			0
" their chief ponders the pageantry and politics of it all and wonders why they bother to go			2
for members of the @entity13 , enduring the @entity11 address is a civic exercise in poker - faced discretion			1
as recent history has shown , that is not always easy			2
tuesday 's speech in the @entity20 chamber by president @entity21 will be watched closely not only for what is said about his second - term agenda , but also for who will be there in person to hear it			1
court members are not required by law to be there , but custom has dictated their appearance in their robes , mostly for show			1
talk back : should president @entity21 use his bully pulpit more ? they are low - key part of the pageantry and are compelled to sit politely and stoically amid the often high - spirited partisan rhetoric and response of the event			1
there is no word yet from the high court about who appear			0
invitations are sent to each chamber and the justices have individual discretion whether to attend			2
usually one or more do			0
@entity51 attends but @entity52 is the one justice who might be called a regular			2

i do wish to attend , so i go , " @entity52 told @entity57 in 2005			0

@entity21 nominated both to the court			1
@entity65 to deliver @entity67 response to @entity21 , @entity68 the political embers were stoked three years ago when @entity21 went after high court conservatives during the speech			1
he singled out the majority ruling in @entity73 , issued a week earlier , which removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections			0
" with all due deference to the separation of powers , " @entity21 said , " the @entity13 reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests , including foreign corporations , to spend without limit in our elections			1
" sitting just feet away in the audience , @entity90 shook his head and mouthed words interpreted as " not true , " referring to the line about " foreign corporations , " court sources later confirmed			0
@entity90 's five fellow justices with him that night showed no emotion			2
chief justice @entity98 labeled the political atmosphere at the 2010 address " very troubling " and said partisan rhetoric and gestures aimed at the court left him questioning whether his colleagues should attend			1
" it does cause me to think whether or not it makes sense for us to be there " @entity98 said weeks after the controversy			1
" to the extent the @entity11 has degenerated into a political pep rally , i 'm not sure why we 're there			1
" @entity114 to deliver @entity68 @entity11 response regardless , @entity98 has never missed a @entity11 as chief justice and is expected to be there next week			1
his predecessor , chief justice @entity118 , rarely appeared in person			1
on one occasion , he considered a painting class more preferable			0
some current justices have been no shows regularly or at times			0
@entity90 had been a regular , but he told an audience after the 2010 event that he felt " like the proverbial potted plant " and would not be attending in the near future			0
justice @entity128 called it " very uncomfortable for a judge to sit there			0

" there 's a lot that you do n't hear on tv , " he said recently			0
" the cat - calls , the whooping , hollering , and under - the breath comments			0
" another more vocal no - go is justice @entity139 , who has compared the televised @entity11 to " cheerleading sessions			1
" " you just sit there , looking stupid , " he said , calling the event and the spasms of partisan applause a spectacle			0
" i resent being called upon to give it dignity			0
" he last attended in 1997			0
