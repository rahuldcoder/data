-- the second @entity3 ticket holder in last month 's record jackpot has come forward to claim winnings worth nearly $ 200 million before taxes , the @entity1 said friday			1
" it is difficult to express just how thankful we are for this wonderful gift , " said the winner , a married man in his 30s whom the lottery said it would not identify publicly , at his request			1
" we are extremely grateful and feel fortunate to now have an increased ability to support our charities and causes			0
obviously , this has been incredibly overwhelming , and we have always cherished our privacy			2
" the message directed reporters to the law firm @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , which did not immediately return a call on friday night			0
the winner lives in @entity27 , northeast of @entity28 , said @entity29 , director of budget , communications and products at the @entity1			2
he and his wife relocated there about a year ago from @entity24 and had played @entity3 in @entity35 only twice , she said			1
the $ 587.6 million jackpot from the november 28 drawing had a cash option of $ 384.7 million before taxes			1
the @entity35 winner has opted to take cash , $ 192.5 million , before taxes			1
fake lottery winner may be @entity45 's most shared photo on the day of the drawing , he went to 4 @entity48 in @entity27 , " handed the clerk a $ 20 bill and he said , ' i 'd like 10 in @entity3 tickets , ' " she told reporters			1
" the retailer tried to encourage him to spend the entire $ 20 and he said , ' no , $ 10 is all i want to spend			2
' clearly , that was enough			0
" he left his ticket overnight on the sun visor in his vehicle and retrieved it the next day , after he and his wife heard there had been a winner in @entity35			1
then they compared the numbers on the ticket against those posted on the lottery website , she said			0
" they checked the numbers over and over again and were just absolutely shocked , " @entity69 said			0
since then , the couple has assembled a legal and financial team to guide them through the process and began meeting with them on monday , going so far as to use a whiteboard to write down how they wanted to allocate their newfound assets , @entity69 said			0
columns on the whiteboard included entries for financial , legal and " fun , " she said			0
the couple opted to claim the prize before the end of the year " because of concerns over the fiscal cliff in 2013 , " she said			0
the winnings are to be awarded on about december 14 , said @entity91 , executive director of the @entity1			0
@entity91 , who met friday morning with the winner in a hotel suite in @entity94 , said the winner likes what he does and has no immediate plans to change it			1
" the winner said , ' you know , i like my job ; i 'd like to continue working my job , ' " @entity91 said			2
he described the man 's work as " just a regular job , like yours or mine -- it 's not a high - level job			2
" the winner 's anonymity is not likely to last			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity1 , @entity112 , said it would release his name on monday to news organizations that file @entity117 requests for it			0
two winners from @entity120 claimed their half of the jackpot on november 30			1
the prize is considered income by the @entity125 , meaning that the highest federal tax rate of 35 % will apply			0
each winner would therefore owe $ 67 million to the @entity125 , said @entity128 , principal analyst at tax research firm @entity129 , in an interview last month			1
state taxes will also apply			0
in @entity35 , a resident who has the winning ticket will be charged a 5 % tax on the prize money			1
if a non-resident bought the winning ticket , a 6 % rate will apply			0
the resulting tax bill will be either $ 10 million or $ 11 million , according to @entity129			2
@entity140 cops share $ 1million @entity3 prize @entity120 charges residents and non-residents a 4 % tax , making the tax liability there nearly $ 8 million			1
taking both state and federal taxes into consideration means the @entity35 winner would owe up to $ 78 million in taxes and take home $ 114 million			1
the @entity120 winner 's tax bill would total about $ 75 million , leaving a take of $ 117.5 million			1
however , in either case , the amount paid in state taxes could likely be deducted on the winners ' federal tax returns , lowering the overall tax liability slightly .			0
