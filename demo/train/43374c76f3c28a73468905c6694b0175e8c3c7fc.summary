@entity8 , best known for his role as the aggressively clueless @entity12 on tv 's " @entity13 , " began his talk with random slides ( " here 's a baby monkey riding a boar " ) , gags about the early days of the @entity21 and jokes about his postings on @entity24 , where he has almost 3 million followers			1

he showed a brief original clip of a " @entity104 " -- cheerful dancers in cartoon - heart costumes , making people smile by engulfing them on a @entity109 boardwalk			0
" that 's why i 'm sharing this , " said @entity8 , a 46 - year - old husband and father			1
" @entity8 's heartfelt tone and proselytizing may have caught audience members off guard			1

on audience interaction : " any questions ? i do n't care			2
" on the @entity126 : " he 's a chubby guy			0
