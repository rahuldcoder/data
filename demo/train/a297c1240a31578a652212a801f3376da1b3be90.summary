-- @entity2 gubernatorial candidate @entity1 looks to help republicans cross an important threshold while expanding their power at the top of state government nationally			1
@entity8 is locked in a competitive race in a state that has n't had a @entity3 governor in nearly 30 years			1
it 's just one example of how the party is leveraging trends and strengthening its hand in a number of ways in state races across the country			2
if projections bear out and they grab four seats in addition to retaining the three they are defending , @entity3 could hold the governorships of 30 states after @entity25 , the most for them in nearly half a century			1
such an advantage would fortify their positions against @entity29 policies , like " @entity30 , " tax increases and government spending and give them enormous influence in @entity2 -- even if @entity35 does n't win the @entity36			1
" it does help @entity3 policy wise if one party controls the majority of governorships , " said @entity38 senior editor @entity37			1
2012 ballot initiatives : voter - run or special interest - hijacked ? while the presidential campaign impacts state - wide candidates -- especially for increasing voter turnout -- races for governor can turn on more parochial issues			1
nowhere is that more apparent than in @entity2			1
@entity8 has deep roots in @entity53 , the state 's most populous			0
he is a former county councilman and has run and won statewide previously			0
his @entity29 opponent , former @entity57 rep. @entity56 , is mostly experienced in congressional races			2
but @entity8 is tapping a sense of voter discontent with a string of @entity29 , whose margin of support has been slim over the years			0
" they 've had @entity29 governors since 1984 and there 's a sense that voters are unhappy that despite promises , these governors have n't been able to change things , " @entity37 said , pointing out problems with education and the economy in the state			2
a recent @entity76 of likely voters showed @entity8 with a 47 % to 45 % lead over @entity56 , which was within the survey 's margin of error			0
while the fight remains tight in @entity2 , @entity29 might have to throw in the towel in @entity85			1
the @entity85 elected its first woman governor in @entity88 @entity87 in 2008 but she is retiring amid a campaign finance investigation			1
@entity91 mayor @entity90 could become the first @entity3 governor since 1985 and only the third since 1901			1
he leads comfortably in the polls against @entity95 lt. gov. @entity95			0
" more than the investigation , " @entity37 said of @entity87 , " you 've got voters with buyer 's remorse			0
the reason she is n't running again is she was behind in all the polls - there was no path to victory for her			2
" key governor 's races snapshots compiled by @entity109 and @entity110 , @entity111 @entity112 gov. @entity113 ( @entity114 ) vs. @entity115 ( r ) @entity29 gov. @entity113 appears headed for a second term this november			2
@entity113 's @entity3 opponent is @entity115 , a small business owner from @entity119			1
@entity112 has become an increasingly reliable @entity29 state and with the defeat of former rep. @entity123 in the 2010 @entity125 primary , the state now has no republicans in statewide elected office			2
@entity115 is unlikely to change the @entity3 's fortunes , especially in a presidential election year with vice president @entity130 , a @entity112 native , on the @entity29 ticket			1
@entity132 ( open seat ) -- gov. @entity134 ( r ) is term - limited rep. @entity135 ( r ) vs. @entity136 ( @entity114 ) vs. @entity137 ( @entity138 ) six - term @entity3 rep. @entity135 mulled a 2012 presidential bid but opted instead to run for governor to replace term - limited @entity3 incumbent @entity134			1
his @entity29 opponent is @entity136 , the former @entity143 speaker			0
@entity135 's years in @entity144 and on the sunday talk show circuit , as well as his brief foray in near - presidential politics , have given him a relatively high profile for a state candidate			2
that , plus @entity132 's @entity3 - friendly state voting trends , gives him a leg up over @entity136			1
@entity3 control the governorship , both @entity125 seats and a majority of @entity157 seats			1
@entity158 gov. @entity159 ( @entity114 ) vs. @entity160 ( r ) democrat @entity159 hopes to become the first @entity158 governor re-elected to a second term since the late @entity163 in 1996			0
the @entity3 nominee is @entity160 , a businessman who has been spending personal funds on the campaign			1
@entity159 won the governorship in 2008 with a comfortable 58.4 % , but @entity158 voters have proven to be fickle at the ballot box , especially for state office			0
since the 1970s , @entity3 and @entity29 have traded control of the governorship six times			1
though a long - time swing state , @entity158 has voted @entity3 in the last three presidential elections			1
the @entity29 incumbent appears to have a leg up in the home stretch			0
@entity179 ( open seat ) -- gov. @entity181 ( @entity114 ) is term - limited @entity182 ( @entity114 ) vs. @entity183			1
rep. @entity184 ( r ) the race to replace outgoing @entity29 incumbent and frequent @entity0 contributor @entity181 is extremely competitive , but it 's been overshadowed by @entity29 sen. @entity189 's equally competitive @entity125 re-election contest			0
the @entity29 nominee is @entity182 , the state attorney general			0
he faces @entity3 @entity184 , a former congressman			1
@entity181 leaves office with fairly high marks			0
he began october with a 61 % approval rating , which helps @entity194			0
but the state leans @entity3 overall			1
@entity197 ( open seat ) -- gov. @entity199 ( @entity114 ) is retiring @entity200 ( @entity114 ) vs. @entity201 ( r ) as is the case in @entity179 , the race in @entity197 to replace a popular outgoing @entity29 governor has become one of the most competitive races			1
the @entity29 nominee is @entity200 , a former state senator			0
she faces @entity3 @entity201 , an attorney and conservative activist who was the @entity209 's choice over @entity210 in the 2010 @entity3 @entity125 primary			1
he also was the @entity3 gubernatorial nominee in 1996 , receiving 39.5 % of the vote against @entity88 @entity213			1
@entity199 leaves office with high marks , which helps @entity216			0
but polling on the gubernatorial race itself has been mixed , with @entity201 leading in two october polls and @entity216 leading in one			2
both candidates were well below the 50 % mark in each poll			2
@entity29 have controlled the governorship for all but two years since @entity213 's win in 1996			0
@entity226 gov. @entity227 ( r ) vs. @entity228 ( @entity114 ) incumbent @entity3 @entity227 seeks a full term in the office previously held by fellow @entity3 @entity231 , who resigned in late 2010 after winning the @entity125 seat held by retiring @entity88 @entity233			1
the @entity29 nominee is @entity228 , the state senate minority leader			0
although there 's a tight @entity125 in the state this year , @entity227 appears to have all the advantages heading into november			2
@entity3 have had a lock on the governorship since 1992			1
@entity239 gov. @entity240 ( r ) vs. @entity241 ( @entity114 ) @entity239 has not had a @entity29 governor in almost 28 years and incumbent @entity3 @entity240 looks likely to continue that trend			2
@entity240 took office in august 2009 when then - gov. @entity245 resigned to become @entity57 ambassador to @entity247			2
he won a 2010 special election to complete the rest of @entity245 's term and received 64 % of the vote over @entity252 , the mayor of @entity253			0
his @entity29 opponent is @entity241 , a businessman and retired two - star major general with the @entity256			2
@entity239 is solid @entity3 country , and @entity240 is a safe bet for re-election			2
@entity259 gov. @entity260 ( @entity114 ) vs. @entity261 ( r ) election night 2012 should be much less suspenseful for @entity29 incumbent @entity260 than it was two years ago			0
that year , @entity260 narrowly edged his @entity3 opponent , @entity263 , 49 % to 48 %			1
under @entity259 law , the state legislature decides the gubernatorial election if no candidate receives a majority of the vote			0
@entity260 officially won the election in january 2011 , though @entity263 conceded the race shortly after @entity25			0
this year , @entity260 is expected to win re-election easily			0
his @entity3 opponent is @entity261 , a state senator			2
@entity274 gov. @entity275 ( @entity114 ) vs. @entity276 ( r ) if it feels like just a year ago when @entity29 incumbent @entity275 ran against @entity3 businessman @entity276 for the @entity274 governorship , that 's because it was			1
@entity275 took office in late 2010 after his @entity29 predecessor @entity280 resigned to take over the late @entity282 's @entity125 seat			0
a year later , @entity275 won a special election to complete the rest of @entity280 's term			0
he beat @entity276 , 50 % to 47 %			0
now , the two face off again for a full term			0
the major difference now is that 2012 is a presidential election year , and the shadow of president @entity290 looms even larger over the race than it did a year ago			0
republicans , as they did in 2011 , hope to link @entity275 with the president , who is unpopular in the @entity274 .			0

republicans could gain four gubernatorial seats this year , crossing the 30 - seat mark nationally
@entity3 gains could help the @entity3 fight *federal* initiatives like health care *reform*
races in @entity2 and @entity85 could elect @entity3 governors for the first time since the 1980s
