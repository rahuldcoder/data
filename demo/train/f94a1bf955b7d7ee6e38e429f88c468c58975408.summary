-- with her decades - long dream of swimming from @entity4 to @entity5 achieved , @entity1 is setting her sights on her next challenge			1
" i am through with the ocean , " she said on @entity0 's " @entity8 " tuesday			1
" never going to be seasick again ! see how happy i look ? " still , she 's off to do something few other people could or would			2
@entity1 plans to swim for 48 hours in @entity13			1
a special pool will be installed for the october 8 - 10 event , a fundraiser for people who lost their homes in @entity19			2
" then we 're going to take that pool to the @entity22 at the anniversary of that terror attack , and we 're going to swim there to help those people recover , " she said			1
after that , she 'll travel to @entity28 , @entity29 , which was ravaged by a massive tornado earlier this year			1
it 's " a nice pool with no waves , no jellyfish , no seasickness , " @entity1 joked			1
" those 48 hours should be a piece of cake , " she told @entity0 's @entity35			1
@entity1 's jellyfish - proof face mask @entity1 's nearly 53 - hour journey in her fifth attempt to cross what she calls " a treacherous stretch of water " ended in victory monday			1
her first effort was 35 years ago , when was in her 20s ; now she 's 64			2
after the previous attempts , people had emphasized to her that " it 's the journey , it 's not the destination , " she said tuesday			2
" it 's all the self - discovery and the wonderful team			2
but i 'll tell you something : this time , the destination really brought me into a state of euphoria			2
" not that she has instantly recovered from what the historic swim did to her			1
the waves were " tough , " and a special facial mask designed to protect her from jellyfish stings led her to " take in a lot of saltwater , " she said			2
" i was very sick			1
" " i 'm a little beat up , " she said			2
she has facial lacerations and effects of saltwater exposure inside her mouth			2
but " the emotional high is wiping out any physical problem			0
" people told her that swimming from @entity4 to @entity73 , @entity5 , was " impossible , " she says			1
people encouraged her to try friendlier waters , such as the @entity76 or @entity77			0
" but @entity4 was in my heart , and when i look at the map , that 's what spoke to my imagination			1
so i did n't want to give up on it			0
and this time i got lucky			0
" " the @entity84 was my friend , and usually it 's not , " she said			0
" usually you 're out there going in circles , going east of the @entity90			0
this time the @entity84 went north , right where i was going			0
" she was surrounded by a team of 35 people along the way " working like a machine , " @entity1 said			1
kayakers helped keep away sharks , and a jellyfish expert was in the water with her , scooping up jellyfish to keep them away from her			0
her handler , @entity100 , helped get her " somehow through the tough moments , " @entity1 said			1
still , it 's " a very isolating experience , " she said			0
opinion : @entity1 shows baby boomers so ' not over ' " when you 're feeling good and you 're cruising through the daylight hours , you 're singing @entity108 songs to yourself and counting in @entity109 and @entity110 and @entity111 , just passing the time			1
" but , she said , " i had two nights of full suffering			0
" at those times , " you 're not thinking of anything			0
you 're just coping and surviving			0
" at a news conference later tuesday morning , a relaxed @entity1 thanked her team and joked as she recounted her swim			1
on sunday night , she said , she hallucinated she was seeing the @entity123			0
recalling a previous attempt , she talked about hallucinating while looking at a streamer of lights that was meant to show her where her support boat was so that she 'd know in what direction to swim at night			2
she remembers telling @entity100 , from the water , that she saw people walking on a yellow brick road , singing " @entity132			0
" @entity100 responded , " that 's where you 're going ; follow them			0
" @entity1 said , drawing laughter			1
the people who have followed her efforts closely for years " are n't sports hounds , " she told @entity0			1
" ... they 're human beings who are dealing with their own heartaches and their own obstacles in life , and they want to know how to get through			0
" @entity1 said she represents a commitment never to give up on something " important to your heart -- you look and see what 's inside yourself and you find a way			1
" and her age speaks to baby boomers , she said			0
" i think people are looking to me to say , ' hell no , i 'm not old			0
' " when i 'm 90 i 'll get in a rocking chair , look at the sunset			0
but look how my friends who are in their 60s are vibrant , at their intellectual peak -- i 'm proving that you can even be at your physical peak at this age			0

@entity1 plans to swim for fundraisers in @entity13 , @entity165 , and @entity28 , @entity29
" i am through with the ocean , " she tells @entity0
@entity1 says she was " very sick " during the swim from @entity4 to @entity5
she sang @entity108 songs in her head and counted to get through , she says
