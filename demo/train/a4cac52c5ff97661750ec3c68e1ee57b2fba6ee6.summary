@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 of @entity0 , @entity1 , got a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at 39 , he was shocked			1
" i had always been pretty active , " said @entity4			1
" but it was a big wake - up call , that what i was doing and my current weight were not ok			0
" that was two years ago			0
since that time , the @entity12 executive decided to make some changes and reverse his diabetes			1
although his doctor recommended he go on medication to control his illness , @entity4 took a different approach			1
instead of meds , he began to exercise every day and changed his diet , cutting out alcohol , fatty foods and watching his carbs			1
do you have diabetes ? how well are you managing it ? " i wanted to be able to know the changes i was making were making a difference , and it was n't the drug , " said @entity4			1
according to new statistics just out from the @entity35 , 25.8 million people , or 8.3 % of the @entity33 population , are affected by either type 1 or type 2 diabetes			1
most , like @entity4 , have type 2 diabetes , which in many people develops later in life			1
caused primarily by genetic makeup , a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits , type 2 diabetes can be reversed in some cases			1
by making changes to their lives such as adding exercise and improving their diets , many type 2 diabetics can drop their glucose or sugar numbers back to the normal range , reversing their condition			1
" we have seen numerous people reverse their condition , " says dr. @entity56 , director of the @entity57 in @entity58			2
" but it takes a real dedication for the rest of their lives , " she notes			0
so why do exercise and diet help reverse diabetes ? to answer that question , we first need to know why people get diabetes in the first place			1
diabetes is caused when there is too much glucose or sugar in the body			1
we get sugar from the things we eat			2
the body is designed to process sugar so it can enter our cells and provide energy			1
but glucose ca n't enter our cells without insulin , which is a hormone produced by the pancreas			2
if you have diabetes , your body is n't making any or is not making enough insulin -- or it ca n't properly use the insulin it is producing			1
as a result , too much sugar stays in the blood			2
if this occurs for a long time , it can lead to serious problems			0
tips for dealing with diabetes type 1 diabetes was once known as juvenile diabetes because it 's usually diagnosed in children and young adults			1
about 5 % to 10 % of all people with diabetes have this type , which is not reversible because the person 's pancreas is not producing insulin at all			1
the remainder have type 2 diabetes			1
for these people , their body can no longer process insulin correctly			0
although genetics plays a part , obesity is a major reason people develop type 2 diabetes			2
" we know that excess body weight adversely affects every organ system in the body , " says dr. @entity119 , director of @entity121 's @entity120 in @entity122			2
" so it should n't be surprising that as obesity increases , as it has over the past 30 years , that medical conditions , especially conditions like type 2 diabetes , will also increase			2
" people who carry excess weight , especially in their midsection , are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes because the fat in their tissues causes an imbalance of insulin in the body			1
the condition is called insulin resistance			0
if they can eliminate that fat by exercising and limiting carbohydrates and alcohol , then many can drop their glucose levels			0
and for some , they can drop them back into the normal range			0
this is also true for people who are prediabetic			0
according to the @entity35 , 79 million @entity33 are prediabetic , which means their glucose readings fall between 100 and 125 while fasting			0
according to the @entity156 , normal glucose readings are 100 and below when a person has not eaten anything			0
numbers above 125 while fasting are considered to be in the diabetic range			0
so when you 're prediabetic , it 's easier to turn those numbers around			0
and that 's important , because once you become a diabetic , even if you drop your numbers , you will always be classified as a diabetic , making it difficult to acquire good insurance			0
" once you fall into that glucose range , you are considered at high risk for developing the condition again , " says @entity170			0
" that 's why we are working on a program right now that goes into the community and reaches those who are at risk of being prediabetic or diabetic , " @entity170 said			0
" the results have been so positive , the @entity35 is looking at the program as a possible protocol for other hospitals to follow			0
" as for @entity4 , his numbers are no longer in the diabetic range			2
he 's lost 40 pounds and watches everything he eats			0
" i educated myself , i read the labels , " said @entity4			2
" i enjoy what i eat			0
i met with nutritionists , and they helped me build a game plan			0
" his physician , dr. @entity192 of @entity193 in @entity58 , says it 's more than just diet ; it 's also the types of foods that @entity4 eats			1
" he cut out significant amounts of sugar and carbs in his diet , really changed how he ate , " says @entity192			1
" he 's increased fiber , increased protein , cut back on alcohol , which is really sugar			2
" but @entity192 notes @entity4 needs to be tenacious			2
" i told him , encouraged as i was , and proud and pleased [ but ] he 's got to keep up those lifestyle habits for things to stay in the right direction , " @entity192 said			0
" without exercise , without diet and without weight control , the diabetes will come back			1
it 's something he will need to manage his whole life			0
" that 's something @entity4 says he would rather do than live as a diabetic .			1
