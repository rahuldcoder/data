@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 have a solution for saving the oil - covered birds in the @entity8			1
however , they also have a problem			0
i saw the solution firsthand during a quick ride through a @entity8 inlet , near @entity4 's home of @entity0 , @entity1 , about a 20 - minute drive outside @entity16			1
the two co-owners of @entity19 - based @entity18 have been working at a breakneck pace for weeks to modify the design of their shallow draft fishing boats , turning them into mobile triage units for pelicans , seagulls , and pretty much any kind of critter caught in the catastrophe			1
their concern on the 65th day of the underwater gusher is deep rooted			0
@entity3 , who says he has " salt water in his blood , " grew up surfing off @entity34 and the @entity35			1
@entity4 , a former shrimper , was raised along @entity1 's @entity8 shores			1
they 're keenly aware that each day adds to the death toll of birds and other animals dying in pockets of oil that invade their natural habitat			2
" we have to do everything we can to take care of them , " said @entity4 , who said he has a serious interest in the " birding world			1
" " we want to do try to do what 's right to help them because they ca n't help themselves			2
" oil - soaked birds : rescue or kill ? unlike more traditional boats , which have deep keels that bog down when they push into shallow marshlands , the custom dragonfly boats can operate in less than a foot of water			1
their broad hulls create very little wake that might further alarm wildlife ; and they 've even been painted a light green color to blend better with their surroundings			2
on board , @entity3 and @entity4 have added a whole set of tools to help wildlife rescuers : a large , skid - proof worktable for crews to handle animals , an adjustable shade canopy which can be easily lowered to slip beneath bayou tree branches , fine mist nozzles to cool the scorching summer temperatures for workers and critters			1
the oil wo n't hamper the boat 's engines , thanks to a special cleaning solution			1
the men consulted wildlife biologists and other scientists as they rushed to make the improvements , and they 've found big donors , like @entity19 musician @entity93 , who are willing to help them make the boats available to rescuers free of charge			1
the vessels will be outfitted with wireless internet access , and plans are in the works to team up with @entity101 to enable anyone to track the boats online in real time			2
onboard web cameras donated by a group in @entity107 , @entity108 , will allow classrooms or anyone else to watch rescuers in action			0
so far , @entity93 has funded construction of one prototype boat , according to the duo			1
the plan is to produce a new boat every seven days from here on out			0
after the cleanup , the animal rescue groups will be allowed to keep the boats for use in research projects			2
clean up crews trample pelican nests no one will make money off of the deal , but the animals could benefit immensely , including brown pelicans , a species native to the eastern @entity8 which has fallen victim to the oil			0
brown pelicans spent almost 40 years on the endangered species list until last year			0
salvaging just a few of the birds is so vital to the survival of the species , said @entity139 , a wildlife adviser with the @entity140 in @entity141			0
" something has got to be done , and of course , it 's worth saving the bird			0
" @entity147 pelican : symbol of survival every day adds to the death toll of the region 's birds and other animals			0
according to a june 22 report from the @entity156 , rescue officials have collected 1,746 birds along the coastline from @entity159 to @entity19			0
of those , 749 were alive and " visibly oiled			0
" another 997 were found dead , and 265 of those were visibly oiled			0
birds that were found alive and then euthanized numbered 143			0
the report states @entity166 's @entity165 spill is not responsible for all dead birds			2
how much is a pelican worth ? although the vessels have been praised by wildlife experts , including marine biologists at the @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 say they 've run into dead ends trying to get their boats into the hands of animal rescuers			1
they 've called federal authorities and @entity166 too , but they say no one seems able to willing to tell them how and when the boats might be put to work			1
@entity3 and @entity4 call their support network the @entity187 , the @entity188 , which is made up of those who have extended a helping hand , which include suppliers , donors and volunteers			1
they 're hoping the combined forces of their group can break through the bureaucracy and get their boats in the hands of animal rescuers			0
it is frustrating to both men , but they say they 've been so encouraged by wildlife experts who have universally praised their innovation , that they 're pressing on , convinced that no less than the lives of thousands of birds are at stake , and the future of their beloved @entity8 too			1
" and we 're going to get all of these people , and we are going to break that ceiling , " said @entity3			2
" and we will go through it -- because it 's our livelihood			0
" @entity2 's @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 and @entity4 develop boat to save oil - covered wildlife
musician @entity93 offers to fund boats for rescue operations , say *boatmakers*
boats operate in shallow water , are outfitted with special tools to save wildlife
wildlife experts praise their idea , but men say feds and @entity166 have n't responded
