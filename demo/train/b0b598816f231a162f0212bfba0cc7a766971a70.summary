@entity0 have been asking whether tuesday 's horrific execution - style killing of three @entity4 students in @entity5 was due to a dispute over a parking spot			2
people do n't die over parking spots			2
@entity12 @entity11 was arrested on tuesday over the deaths of @entity14 , 23 , @entity15 , 21 , and @entity16 , 19			1
@entity18 police have said that an ongoing dispute over a parking place may have been a contributing factor			2
but while that may be true , the evidence suggests that @entity11 had an underlying animosity towards the victims because of their beliefs			1
on his @entity28 page , @entity11 reportedly showed his support for " anti-theism , " the active opposition of religious belief			1
as @entity34 explained in a recent essay , anti-theists often view " religion as an insidious force that must be rooted from society -- forcibly if necessary			2
" the lead photo on @entity11 ' page talked about how he wanted " religion to go away , " and in a 2012 post , he quoted heavily from biologist and so - called " new @entity45 " @entity44			1
@entity46 , the father of two of the victims , said his daughter -- who wore the @entity4 headscarf and lived next door to @entity11 -- had reportedly told her family a week earlier " that she had a hateful neighbor			1
" the @entity55 and @entity56 reported that he also said that in the past , she had told her family that @entity11 picked on her and her husband and would talk to them while carrying his gun in his belt , making them feel extremely uncomfortable			1
" ' honest to @entity63 , ' she said , ' he hates us for what we are and how we look , " he recalled			2
@entity11 ' postings on social media suggest that he is not only anti-religion , but like many prominent @entity68 , likely has a particular contempt for @entity4			1
although @entity44 condemned the murders on @entity72 , it is hard not to recall the comments he and other new atheists like @entity75 and @entity76 have made about @entity4 in the past			0
@entity44 himself said he considers this religion of some 1.6 billion people " as one of the great evils in the world			0
" for his part , @entity11 allegedly wrote , " when it comes to insults , your religion started this , not me			1
if your religion kept its big mouth shut , so would i. " following the shootings , the attorney of @entity11 ' wife said that her husband " had a problem with many of his neighbors , " and that the " victims were at the wrong time and the wrong place			1
" but when we consider @entity11 ' own comments and postings on social media in the context of much of the @entity108 rhetoric we see in the media and elsewhere , it is hard to see tuesday 's tragedy as a genuinely random incident			1
anti-muslim hate crimes are five times more common today than they were before 9/11			0
and just a couple weeks ago , a @entity115 state senator effectively questioned the loyalties of @entity117 , reportedly posting on her @entity28 page that she had left instructions with her office that @entity4 visitors " publicly announce allegiance to @entity122 and our laws			0
" neighbors have said that @entity11 was prone to outbursts and that he made everyone feel unsafe , @entity4 or otherwise			1
but that in and of itself does n't make @entity11 an equal opportunist when it comes to his choice of alleged victims			1
being mentally unstable or a generally angry person and being motivated by religious hate are not mutually exclusive			0
in a move familiar to many @entity4 organizations that are called upon to denounce the actions of a violent co-religionist , the @entity138 organization issued a statement condemning the murders of the three @entity4 students			0
but we should n't expect them or any organization to apologize for the murderous actions of an individual			0
if @entity11 is found guilty , there is no doubt that he alone should bear the responsibility for his actions and be punished accordingly			2
even if he self - identifies as atheist , atheists and atheism are not to blame for his heinous actions			0
still , although the killings of these three young @entity162 should not be attributed to a lack of belief in @entity63 , they were allegedly committed by a man with an active contempt for belief in @entity63			0
regardless of whether law enforcement deems these killings officially a hate crime , we as a society need to acknowledge that violent extremists come in all creeds -- and they can be inspired and their anger nourished by any religion , or animosity towards one			0
with this in mind , the mainstream majority -- hailing from whatever faith or ideology -- needs to stand united against these kinds of acts of violence , regardless of the source			1
in practical terms , this means going beyond condemnation , by following the examples of people like @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 who lived out their faith values through service to others			0
we should also follow the example of organizations like @entity198 , which launched an atheist and humanist community drive to honor the victims			0
ultimately , our nation 's diversity is its strength			0
as citizens , we must do whatever we can to protect it .			0

@entity12 @entity11 is being held over killing of three muslims
@entity212 : we need to stand united against these kinds of acts of violence
