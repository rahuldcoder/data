-- @entity1 finished the @entity3 final in @entity4 sunday with a broad smile on his face			1
it is not the reaction one would expect from a top - 10 player thrashed 6 - 0 6 - 2 , but his opponent was world number one @entity13 , and the @entity14 had been in unstoppable form			1
@entity16 star @entity1 was 6 - 0 5 - 0 down and facing the humiliation of the " double bagel " before staging a brief rally to break back and at least get two games on the board			1
so his demeanor at the handshake was one of pure relief , despite hardly troubling the scoreboard in a one hour six minute match			0
@entity13 broke @entity1 's giant serve at will from the start and was never seriously troubled as he hit 19 winners in the one - sided contest			2
the loser acknowledged that he had been playing against someone in very special form			0
" i just said to my coach now that i probably played over 700 matches in my career , and i met guys like @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , all those probably in their best times			0
but i have never , ever experienced anything like that , " he told the @entity46 website			0
form had dictated that @entity13 would emerge the winner , he has entered the @entity51 event in the @entity53 capital on five occasions and each time he has won the title			1
a straight sets semifinal win over @entity59 's @entity58 had also shown him at his best , but @entity1 had also dispatched @entity60 , the quarterfinal conqueror of world number two @entity63			2
@entity13 will now head to @entity64 for a masters 1000 tournament , which he has won for the past two years			0
the @entity67 event in @entity4 was claimed by @entity69 's @entity68 , who beat @entity70 in a tight three - set final			1
@entity68 will leapfrog @entity70 to go to number two in the rankings with a 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 3 win over the @entity16			1
it was her first title since claiming the @entity76 and her fourth of the year			0
@entity70 saved a match point in a marathon eighth game in the third set , but @entity68 closed it out in the next game , her sixth victory over her opponent in eight career clashes			0
in sunday 's other @entity46 final , there was a popular home triumph for @entity88 in the @entity89			2
he beat @entity92 's big - hitting @entity91 , the same player he beat for the 2012 @entity94 title , 7 - 6 4 - 6 6 - 4 at the @entity95			1
@entity88 , who beat @entity96 in the semifinals of the @entity98 before losing to @entity99 , has risen to number five in the race to qualify for the season - ending @entity102 in @entity103 .			0
