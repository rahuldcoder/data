president @entity0 sought to reclaim some ownership over an issue that is suddenly a hot topic among top @entity4 , telling an audience on friday that he welcomes his rival party focusing on income inequality , but questioned whether it was anything more than talk			1
" now that their grand predictions of doom and gloom and death panels and @entity15 have n't come true			0
the sky has n't fallen , chicken little is quiet , " @entity0 said			1
" the new plan is to re-brand themselves as the party of the middle class			0
i am not making this up			0
" to laughs from the @entity26 audience in @entity27 , @entity0 added : " i am encouraged they are speaking about middle class and about wages			1
but there is this old saying , you ca n't just talk the talk			0
... you 've got to walk the walk			0
" income inequality and the growing gap between the richest and poorest @entity38 has become a primary issue in the 2016 election and many @entity4 vying for the party 's nomination have focused on the issue			1
the comments have not gone unnoticed by @entity45 and the @entity46			0
" we 're facing right now a divided @entity38 when it comes to the economy , " said sen. @entity47 , @entity48 , after @entity0 's january address to the nation			1
" income inequality has worsened under this administration , " sen. @entity54 , @entity55 , said after the president 's @entity58 speech			1
on friday , @entity0 took on @entity54 directly , noting that the 2016 hopeful once said his party needs to show up " up on the @entity65 " and shout " at the top of our lungs : ' we are the party of jobs and opportunity			1
' " " i think that is encouraging that he wants to go to the @entity65 of @entity71 , " @entity0 said with a smile			2
" i was just home on the @entity65 of @entity71 yesterday and i guarantee you that senator @entity54 would be welcome there			0
we are a friendly bunch			0
" @entity0 added : " i mean , it is a little strange if people show up and just start shouting on the top of their lungs			2
but we are friendly , it would be ok			0
" when @entity0 first mentioned @entity54 , some in the audience groaned at his name			2
hearing this , @entity0 said , " no , @entity54 is an interesting guy			2
" the president views the improving economy after a difficult recession as a potential cornerstone of his legacy			1
in the foreword to a report on the nation 's brightening fiscal picture from the @entity94 , @entity0 writes " the @entity38 has just concluded a breakthrough year			2
" related : @entity96 's supporters look for their next win @entity0 has made fewer references to the issue of income inequality in recent months in favor the term " middle class economics , " which was a major theme of his @entity58 speech			1
aides to the president insist @entity4 leaders have flocked to the issue of income inequality only in an attempt to diminish @entity26 claims to the nation 's improving economy			1
before the speech , a @entity46 official said @entity0 would use his @entity26 speech to call out republicans for what he sees as hypocrisy			2
" so far , at least , the rhetoric has not matched the reality , " @entity0 said on friday			2
" i think the shift in rhetoric that they are engaging in is good , if it actually leads them to take different actions			2
if it does n't , then it is just spin			0
" the president also seemed to lightly touch on recent comments by former @entity132 mayor @entity131 , who said earlier this week that he does n't think president @entity0 " loves @entity38			1
" " this is not just a sports contest , this is not just who 's up and down at any given point , it 's not about notches on a belt , it 's not about ideological battles an proving how smart you are , " @entity0 said			0
" it 's about making this nation we love more perfect			0
" republicans , in response to most positive economic numbers , have said there are still glaring vulnerabilities in the nation 's recovery			0
" after spending the last six years growing @entity27 instead of the middle class , it 's no surprise president @entity0 can only point fingers rather than point to meaningful success , " said @entity156 spokesman @entity155			1
" the reality is @entity38 have suffered under the slowest economic recovery in modern times , and on his watch , the middle class lost its status as being the world 's richest as more and more families fall out rather than move up			0
" @entity46 @entity4 have had a similar response to the president 's message			1
" there 's a reason why the @entity45 has lost the @entity46 , the @entity175 , governorships , and more than 900 state legislative seats in recent years			0
president @entity0 's liberal agenda has left @entity38 's working class families behind , " @entity180 spokesman @entity179 said .			1

president @entity0 said he welcomed @entity4 talking about income inequality " if it actually leads them to take different actions "
