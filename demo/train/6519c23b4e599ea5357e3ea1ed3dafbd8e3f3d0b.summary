@entity0 -- fellow @entity2 mounted increasing pressure wednesday for rep. @entity4 to resign , a day after party leaders turned their backs on the liberal congressman embroiled in a " sexting " scandal			1
sen. @entity10 of @entity11 and @entity12			0
@entity13 of @entity14 , @entity15 of @entity16 , @entity17 of @entity11 , @entity18 of @entity19 , @entity20 of @entity21 and @entity22 of @entity23 joined a growing chorus of @entity2 voices that have called for @entity4 , @entity26 - @entity27 , to step down over sexually tinged online communications with several women that he then lied about			1
" enough is enough , " @entity22 said in a statement			0
" it 's time for congressman @entity4 to resign			1
his actions have disgraced the @entity34			0
everyone should be focused on jobs and the economy and his refusal to do the right thing is a distraction			0
" what do you think about rep. @entity4 's confession ? in addition , @entity22 and some other @entity2 have announced they were donating campaign contributions from @entity4 to charity			1
@entity49 , the former senior advisor to president @entity50 now heading @entity50 's re-election campaign , told @entity1 that he expected the situation to get resolved " one way or another ... fairly quickly			2
" i 'm sure he 's doing a lot of soul - searching , " @entity49 said of @entity4			1
a @entity2 legislator familiar with discussions with and about @entity4 told @entity1 that @entity4 's colleagues are telling him he should resign " to preserve his own dignity			1
" the congressman , who spoke on condition of not being identified by name in order to discuss private conversations , said the public call by @entity13 was part of a stepped - up effort to force @entity4 out			1
according to the source , the effort includes private and public calls explicitly telling him it 's time to leave @entity34			2
" there is increased resentment by his colleagues that far from having a press conference where he was going to tell the truth and roll with the flames , the flames are just getting worse and he 's dragging us through it , " the source said			0
" we really thought by now , after the press conference , we would be able to talk about the @entity86 ' social security privatization bill and instead we keep talking about @entity4			2
and people are getting angrier and more resentful			0
" a new explicit photograph now published on the @entity91 , allegedly of @entity4 's naked genitals , is the latest example of how the issue was not going away , the @entity2 legislator said , adding it was unclear if @entity4 would listen			1
" i think he is truly conflicted and the people around him are truly conflicted , " the source said			0
" nobody knows what is going to work			0
" more public calls for @entity4 's resignation are expected , the source added			1
also wednesday , multiple @entity27 @entity2 sources told @entity1 it is highly likely @entity4 's district will be eliminated as part of next year 's redistricting process			1
@entity4 , who is married , admitted earlier this week that he engaged in sexually tinged communications with multiple women and lied about it			2
the @entity109 reported wednesday that @entity4 and his wife , @entity110 , are expecting their first child			2
@entity112 , a colleague and friend of @entity110 , responded " no comment " when asked about the pregnancy report			0
@entity4 's admission monday launched calls from @entity86 and then an increasing number of @entity2 for him to step aside			1
" it would be fine with me , " @entity10 said wednesday			0
" i think at this point it would probably be a good thing if he would go ahead and resign			0
" former @entity123 chairman @entity122 said tuesday that @entity4 's attempted cover - up of the scandal makes him unfit for office			1
" lying is unforgivable , " said @entity122 , now a @entity128 candidate in @entity129			0
" lying publicly about something like this is unforgivable and he should resign			0
" while other democrats have n't explicitly called on @entity4 to step down , they have done little to demonstrate any support for him			1
" @entity140 has some problems , " sen. @entity136 of @entity137 , the @entity128 's no. 2 @entity138 , told reporters wednesday			0
" i wish there was some way i could defend him , but i ca n't , " senate majority leader @entity142 , @entity143 , said tuesday			0
asked what he would say if @entity4 sought advice , @entity142 smiled and responded : " i 'd tell him to call someone else			1
" @entity152 minority leader @entity151 , @entity153 , who called for an ethics investigation monday , released a letter tuesday detailing her formal request for the inquiry			0
@entity151 's letter " certainly adds pressure for him to go , " said a senior @entity2 aide , who spoke on condition of not being identified			1
@entity4 , who has said he would welcome an ethics probe , publicly apologized monday for sending flirtatious messages and images on @entity165 and @entity166 to six women over the past three years and then denying it for a week			2
over the past three days , he has been reaching out to a number of colleagues and supporters , according to one source			0
among other things , @entity4 called former president @entity174 -- who officiated at his wedding ceremony -- to personally express regret for his actions			1
according to a @entity2 congressman who got one of the calls , @entity4 was " very contrite " and said he " let everyone down			1
" the legislator , speaking on condition of not being named because it was a private conversation , said @entity4 was so choked up he could " barely get the words out , " and told him that he was going to " get some help			2
" wednesday 's publication online of the explicit photo that a conservative blogger claims shows @entity4 's genitals was the latest twist in the scandal			1
@entity193 , whose biggovernment.com website broke the story of @entity4 's sexting , said the photo came from a woman who told him @entity4 sent it to her			1
@entity4 acknowledged monday that such an x-rated photo of him could exist			1
also wednesday , one of the women with whom @entity4 communicated online said the congressman initiated sexual exchanges			1
" i would want to talk politics			0
but he would turn it creepy , " @entity207 , a 40 - year - old blackjack dealer from @entity208 , told @entity209 ' " @entity211			0
" @entity207 said she believes @entity4 has " a weird fetish , " but that " it does n't make him a bad politician ... or a bad congressman			2
it makes him a bad husband			0
" asked what she 'd say to @entity4 's wife , @entity207 said : " i want to apologize			1
i should not have been flirting with her husband			0
" an ethics investigation would examine if @entity4 violated @entity152 rules or brought the chamber into disrepute			2
the code of conduct for members of @entity34 calls for them to conduct themselves " at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the @entity152			0
" however , ethics experts say legislators are rarely , if ever , disciplined for violating that rule alone			0
using government technology such as telephones and computers for his sexting could be another story			0
@entity4 said monday he used his personal @entity240 and home computer , but added : " i do n't have the knowledge of every last communication , but i do n't believe that i used any government resources			2
" even if he did , that does n't automatically subject him to @entity152 discipline , said @entity247 , a former @entity152 general counsel who has represented legislators before the ethics panel			0
members of @entity34 sometimes use official resources for nongovernment activities , @entity247 noted , adding that " the @entity152 has never taken a position or disciplined someone for that use			0
" back in @entity4 's district -- which straddles @entity257 and @entity258 -- voters were divided over what the congressman should do			1
some constituents said he should " never resign , " while others called for his immediate ouster			2
@entity4 was first elected to @entity34 in 1998 and has won seven straight elections			2
whether or not @entity4 retains the support of most of his constituents , many analysts believe he has almost certainly lost his spot as a front - runner in @entity27 's 2013 mayoral election			2
in addition , multiple @entity27 @entity2 sources told @entity1 on wednesday they believe it is highly likely @entity4 will ultimately lose his congressional district as part of a redistricting deal			1
@entity27 will lose two of its 29 @entity278 @entity152 seats by 2012 due to recent @entity278 @entity280 results			0
before news broke of the @entity4 scandal , most @entity27 state government observers believed one @entity86 seat upstate would be lost along with one @entity2 seat downstate			1
the fact that @entity4 is now tarnished makes it extremely likely his seat will be the one that @entity2 sacrifice , the sources said			1
two of the sources -- both @entity2 strategists in @entity27 -- said the impending redistricting is one reason @entity27 @entity2 are n't rushing to call on @entity4 to resign			1
many believe it is better for them if he stays because it makes it more likely that his district will be eliminated instead of theirs , the sources noted			2
@entity1 's @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity308 contributed to this story .			0
