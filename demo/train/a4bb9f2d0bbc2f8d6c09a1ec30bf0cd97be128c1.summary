-- @entity2 , wizened and dressed in a tattered old jelaba robe , @entity1 lives in a world in which fact and fantasy are blurred together through an ancient alchemy			1
almost every day over four decades and more , he 's stood out in @entity9 , the great sprawling square that forms the heart of medieval @entity11 in @entity12			1
in cold winter rain and mist , and in the searing heat of the endless desert summer , he 's one enduring fixture , a constant force in a realm constantly touched by change			1
he stands there , knitted cap pulled down tight over a balding scalp , fingers gnarled and black with dirt , a face conjured from a weather - worn sheet of chapped leather			2
as the muezzin 's voice radiates down over the long morning shadows , @entity30 finishes his prayer and steps out into the sunlight			1
having given a blessing that begins " all things to the pious , " he claps his hands to gain an audience			2
all of a sudden , the story begins : " there was once a woodcutter named @entity43 , " he says , his voice rasping a tale from the " arabian nights			2
" " a man who was as honest and kind as any other alive ... " within an instant , a halqa has formed , a sacred circle of souls			1
pressed shoulder to shoulder , the listeners crane forward , as they do , day in day out , every day			2
for them , @entity30 's stories are a kind of magical lifeblood , a wisdom and an entertainment all rolled into one			1
" he transports us to distant kingdoms , " says @entity61 , a shopkeeper from a nearby perfume stall			2
" only he can weave magic like this			2
i was brought up with his tales , just as my own sons have been			1
" the hakawati , the storyteller , lowers his voice , a technique to draw the listeners in towards him			2
he takes his time , feeding them the tale as though it were some delicious sweet			2
powders and homemade lotions a stone 's throw away , a healer is setting up his stall			1
he 's dressed in the light blue robe of the @entity86 , his skin as dark as his teeth are white			1
from an old @entity90 chest he pulls out his wares -- a clutch of ostrich eggs , a pair of dried chameleons , a jaguar 's skull and an assortment of vials and jars , powders and homemade lotions			1
beside him is another medicine man			1
his stock in trade is sulfur and antimony , dried damask roses , and a half - gallon pot of lizard oil			2
across from him is a dentist			2
in his right hand is a pair of electrical pincers			2
in his left , a shoebox half - filled with human teeth			2
" i never cause any pain , " he explains meekly			2
" you see , it 's because i whisper a spell as i make the extraction			1
take a seat here , sir , and i will prove it to you now			2
" by late morning , the tale of the woodcutter @entity43 is nearing its end , and the dentist , from the inner reaches of the desert , is posing for a picture			0
a tourist from @entity132 slips out his camera and points to a bottle marked with a skull and crossed bones			0
he wonders aloud what 's inside			1
the @entity86 healer grins a fearsome , almost maniacal grin			0
" it 's for revenge , " he lisps			1
the last shadows melt away as noon approaches , and as the summer heat begins its raw and unrelenting suffocation			0
a scattering of tourists amble about , soaking up an atmosphere that has allured visitors for centuries			0
they 're from every corner of the world			0
distant desert outpost these days most people fly in directly to @entity11			1
it sometimes feels as though they hardly have a clue where are			0
after all , the airport could be anywhere			0
the ancient mud walls that encircle the city 's medina are a clue though -- a clue that this was once a distant desert outpost , fortified for life and death			1
@entity11 may be easy to get to now , but it 's smack in the middle of @entity12 's red desert			1
with that heritage comes a kind of @entity174 sense of the miraculous			0
like the tales woven by @entity30 , @entity11 blurs the lines between fact and fantasy , and touches all who venture here with its sorcery			1
as the afternoon heat reaches its height , the snake charmers slink out from the cool of the cafes , the shrill sound of their flutes , known as @entity190 , forming a hypnotic stage on which their overheated cobras perform			1
gradually , the afternoon heat begins to wane			0
and , as it does so , a slew of acrobats tumble and fall across the square 's great open space			1
members of the @entity199 , an ancient brotherhood , they clatter huge iron castanets , warding away supernatural jinn			1
@entity30 pauses for the late afternoon prayer			0
when he 's done , he sips a little water and chews on m'simmen , a kind of @entity209 pancake			1
and then , wiping his eyes with the corner of his handkerchief , he begins another favored tale from " @entity217 , " a story half as old as time , called " @entity216			0
" sheep brains and spicy sausages as his words waft out over the square , there 's the thunderous sound of steel wheels rapping hard over stone			1
dozens of iron carts are hurtling forward			0
like gun carriages hastening to war , they 're pushed into position at lightning speed , and quickly unloaded			0
within a few minutes , clouds of dense oily smoke are billowing up into the dusk , as the stalls start touting all manner of foods			0
in @entity9 's nocturnal incarnation , tourists and locals dine on sheep 's brains and spiced @entity90 sausages , mutton tagines , roasted chicken and trout			1
a lithe good - mannered figure is hustling for custom outside @entity249			0
going by the nickname " @entity252 , " he appears ready to sell anything			0
working as a volunteer in an orphanage by day , he supports himself by touting in the square at night			1
" one - one - seven ! " he cries is a faux cockney voice			0
" it 'll take you to heaven ! " away from the smoke , the incandescent light bulbs , and the uproar of the feast , a blind musician draws a bow over the strings of a battered old violin			0
a microphone strapped around his neck leads to a little amplifier , cupped in the hands of his young grandson			0
the sound stretches out like a magic carpet laid over the desert floor			0
listen hard , and you find yourself transported back in time to an encampment in the wilderness , a watering hole for camels and men			1
as the night approaches , the medicine men and the healers pack up their bones , their potions , and their boxes of human teeth			1
the @entity199 disappear into the shadows , and the snake charmers slink away home for another night			1
@entity30 is one of the last to go			0
pausing at a cliffhanger in his epic tale , he tugs off his knitted cap and holds it upside down			0
a few dirham coins are dropped in by locals			0
the storyteller does a mental calculation			0
" they 'll be back here in the morning as sure as day follows night , " he says			0
" you see , they 're caught in my spell			0
i can see it in their eyes			0
they simply ca n't resist			0
" @entity316 moved from @entity317 to @entity318 10 years ago			0
he 's the author of more than 15 books and is best known for " @entity320 , " which details the tribulations of living in a haunted @entity209 home .			1

in the evening the square comes alive with musicians and acrobats
