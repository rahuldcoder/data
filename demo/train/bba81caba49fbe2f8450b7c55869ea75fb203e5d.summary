@entity0 -- in the spirit of spring rebirth , the occupy movement is ramping up activities as warm weather blankets the country			1
but while the season is typified by a reawakening of life outdoors , demonstrators are using sleep to get their points across			2
they call it " sleepful protest			2
" the sleeping bags started appearing on the corner of @entity19 and @entity20 streets across from the @entity21 on april 9			1
a civil rights attorney sympathetic to the @entity23 provided the legal justification for the move in the form of a court ruling from 2000			2
a federal district court judge said people can sleep on sidewalks as a form of political expression as long as they take up no more than half of the sidewalk and do n't block any doors			1
occupy organizers declared a month ago that the movement would be planning a comeback in the spring and summer			1
some city and state governments , armed with new ordinances aimed at the occupy movements , are ready to prevent demonstrators from re-establishing encampments			2
for the past few nights , dozens of @entity46 protesters have slept on a patch of concrete a stone 's throw away from the traders and stock brokers who are the targets of their message			1
" the goal here is to not violate the law and not give the police a reason to move the group , " said @entity56 , who has taken part in occupy demonstrations for several months			0
every morning , they talk about income inequality and the role of big money in politics as commuters pass by on their way to jobs in the @entity73			0
most people who work in the area seem indifferent			0
" they just do n't understand how things work , " said @entity76 , chief market analyst at @entity77			0
" they have fantasy ideas			0
but , they 're entitled to their opinions			0
" while police have occasionally forced the protesters to move so the sidewalk could be cleaned , and a few have been arrested , occupy protester @entity84 is not deterred			1
" we 're not afraid anymore			0
i mean , we 've been through so much			0
all of us have been to jail , " said @entity84 , a 27 - year - old with hair dyed neon blue			1
" we know we 're doing the right thing			0
" what are @entity97 really fighting for ? so - called sleepful protests have popped up elsewhere in the country with varying degrees of success			1
in @entity102 , police have been less accommodating , while in @entity104 , protesters have taken to sleeping outside @entity106 branches , a frequent target of the @entity23			2
similar sidewalk sleep - ins are taking place in @entity110 and @entity111			1
the protesters on @entity46 do n't expect their sleep - in to grow into an encampment like the one that became home to hundreds of people at nearby @entity119			1
" i view this as the pre-campaign			0
i certainly doubt that this will still be here may 1st when the big rallies start , " @entity56 said			0
