@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the heart of @entity0 , the frenzied capital of the @entity1 , classical music has found an unlikely band of heroes			1
past the noisy , gritty markets and the cacophony of the city 's congested streets , a large group of amateur local musicians has been defying adversity and challenges to bring musical harmony to one of @entity18 's most chaotic capitals			2
passionate about the likes of @entity22 and @entity23 , the @entity19 is a musical ensemble of some 200 enthusiastic men and women , eager to make their voices heard and follow their dream of making classical music			1
" i love music , " says violin player @entity30 , who has been in the orchestra since 1995			1
" it makes me feel good -- i can say music is one of the things that comforts me , takes off the stress and makes me happy			2
" watch the orchestra perform @entity39 yet , running such an orchestra in a city like @entity0 is no easy task			1
rehearsals usually take place in the late hours as most musicians have to work during the day to make a living			2
more often than not , power blackouts -- a regular occurrence in @entity0 -- will bring the evening rehearsals to a temporary halt , prompting the musicians to put down their instruments and try to fix the problem			1

when they are not practicing outdoors , musicians will often converge at the house of founder and conductor @entity63 , which despite its large size can not fit all of the group 's members ; quite often some of the choir 's singers have to stand outside the rehearsal room , piling around open windows and doorways to make sure they are heard			1
but despite the constant logistical problems , the lack of resources and the limited funding , the @entity19 is constantly growing			0
" this is a passion , " says violin player @entity79			2
" that is why when we are here , we forget about everything else , we only think about music and nothing else			2
" @entity79 says the members of the orchestra are united by their love of music			1
" we 're all musicians and we are so used to each other that we live like a family , " he adds			2
" we even call the orchestra the ' big symphonic family			0

at the beginning , he says , people did not understand what he was trying to achieve			0
" it is only after our concert in december of 1994 that people understood what we wanted to do , because then the orchestra was there in front of them , " he remembers			0
" what was extraordinary was that after the concert there were lots of people that came to register to be trained in music and to start playing in the orchestra			2
people were blown away -- it was something new in our community			0
" @entity63 says that when the orchestra started out they did n't have enough instruments to go around , so musicians often had to pool money together to buy used ones			1
they also had to figure out a way to fix broken instruments , or even build them from scratch			0
" we tried to find substitutions for some instruments " he says			0
" for example , we did n't have a place where we could buy strings , so we used bicycle cable for the strings			2
" so many times also we tried to fix ourselves some instruments and also i remember one day i was with a friend , i told him , ' why must we buy instruments ? can we try to build a cello or double bass ? ' so we tried to do this			0

called " @entity162 , " the film captured the musicians ' remarkable musical talent and resilient spirit in the face of daily challenges			0
" the passion is there and that has allowed us to go above the difficulties , " says @entity63			2
" the symphony orchestra has brought us a form of discipline , something new that allows each one of us to bring a contribution in what we were doing			1
" every now and then the orchestra holds free concerts in @entity0 , aimed at inspiring a new generation of musicians and enabling more people to discover the work of classical composers			1
" up to now , this style of music is still foreign to people here , " explains @entity63			1
" some people feel it 's @entity187 music but we say it 's not -- it 's an expression for us of our own culture			0
" @entity63 says that another reason for the concerts is to show people in the @entity1 that music can be appreciated in a different way from the one they 're used to			1
" here in our country , music is listened to so that you can dance , " he explains			0
" it is very rare that it is listened to just for meditation but i think classical music takes you really far			0
" it allows you to meditate and express certain things that you might not be able to express with other style of music			0
" ultimately , @entity63 says his biggest dream is to create a music school that will enable local musicians to export the country 's rich culture through classical music			1
" i believe that kids growing up with this music and their @entity1 culture will be able to express themselves better than us tomorrow , " he says			0
" they 'll do symphonies or sonatas which will be classical but completely @entity18			0
that is my biggest dream , to create a music school where kids will learn how to play instruments and adults will be able to learn as well			1
