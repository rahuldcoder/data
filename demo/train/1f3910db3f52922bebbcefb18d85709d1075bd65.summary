-- you can take the man out of the uniform , but you ca n't take the uniform out of the man			2
once a soldier , always a soldier			2
that 's why , despite my cautious optimism regarding president @entity11 's recent announcement of the planned end of the @entity14 war , i 'm still a little wary			1
this is n't the first time a president has told me the war was over			2
on may 1 , 2003 , my men and i were in @entity20 , waiting for orders to move into @entity14			1
a young rifle platoon leader in the infantry , i knew just enough to be both eager and nervous			2
everyone knows what happened next : the aircraft carrier , the flight suit , the @entity29 banner			1
a declaration of an end to major combat operations			0
we thought our war had ended before it even began			1
little did we know it was just starting			0
our orders to move north were issued that very day			0
and very soon , we found the war we thought was gone , in the streets and alleys of @entity40			2
eight - and - a - half messy years later , a war the @entity43 people were led to believe would only last a few weeks is -- in theory -- winding down			1
historians will debate the question of whether it was worth it for generations			0
did it establish a stable democracy in the heart of the @entity53 ? no one can say for sure			0
did it punish the deserving and bring justice to those that sought to do us harm ? that 's an even tougher one			0
did it affect the @entity63 ? perhaps , but so did @entity64			0
and can we really say the war is " over " when bombs are still going off and killing @entity14 , untold amounts of contractors are staying , and troops are still dying ? what ca n't be debated are the effects on those who did the fighting			1
more than 4,400 @entity43 families are forever shattered , having lost a son or a daughter or a mother or a brother			1
over 32,000 service members were wounded in action physically			0
and the war lives on in the hearts and memories of every @entity14 veteran , whether they 've transitioned smoothly back to civilian life with a job or are still ravaged by their experience and in desperate need of help			1
make no mistake about it -- @entity43 has only started to pay for this war			1
it 's like the hidden charges on bills from the cable company , they might not get you right away , but they 'll get you eventually			0
@entity14 veterans are young hard - chargers now , but as time passes , that will change , just as it does for every person			1
they will grow older , marry , have kids , and , if given the opportunity , grow into the @entity111 title bestowed upon them			0
but that 's going to take time , care and money			2
long term , it 's estimated that these wars could cost between $ 600 billion and $ 1 trillion , to include the care for more than 2.3 million @entity14 and @entity122 veterans			1
those are imposing numbers , to be sure , especially in this time of an economic recession and spiraling debt			0
but those numbers will only increase with time if we slash veteran program funding in a shortsighted rush , as some in @entity133 have begun chattering about			0
whether one agreed with the @entity14 war or not , we all own it now			1
that 's how our country works			0
every single brave man and woman who wore the uniform overseas went over there wearing the @entity43 flag , representing us and our nation 's ideals			1
now , the time has finally come for all of them to return home on december 31 , 2011			0
and a new front awaits back here			0
one president began the @entity14 war			1
but it was yet another commander - in - chief , president @entity153 , who said , " let us strive on to finish the work we are in ; to bind up the nation 's wounds ; to care for him who shall have borne the battle , and for his widow , and his orphan			2
" that work is n't done			0
and until it is , i wo n't consider the @entity14 war over			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			2

@entity167 says he once was *fooled* into thinking the @entity14 war was over
after the " @entity29 " speech , the real war began , he says
whatever happens after @entity43 troops leave @entity14 , the war will continue for @entity43
he says it could cost up to $ 1 trillion to care for the @entity14 , @entity122 veterans
