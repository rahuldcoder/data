@entity10 's appointment came on the same day supporters of @entity17 's called for a " @entity31			1
" @entity17 's government collapsed after @entity5 withdrew its support for him this month			1
that came because of @entity17 's cooperation with the @entity36 , which is expected to indict @entity5 members in connection with the assassination of former prime minister @entity40 , the father of @entity17			1
@entity10 said he is prepared to push ahead and form a government without @entity17 if necessary			1

" @entity17 said he appreciated those who called for the demonstration " to defend their democratic rights and beliefs , " but he said anger should not be expressed by blocking streets , burning tires and violating other people 's liberties			1
" i want to express my extreme sorrow toward the violence that took place , and i warn everyone not to be dragged in any situation by any suspicious calls for violence , " @entity17 said			1
