" secretary of state @entity1 says " there is no greater honor than to serve this country , " " so we can sit here and talk about the long record , but what i would say to you is that this president has faced tougher circumstances than perhaps at any time since the end of @entity21 , and he has delivered policies that are going to stand the test of time , " @entity10 said in an interview that aired on @entity13 ' " @entity12			1

she praised the administration 's ability to change the conversation in the @entity31			0
" this is n't a popularity contest			0
i 'm sorry , it is n't			0
what the administration is responsible to do is to make good choices about @entity27 ' interests and values in the long run -- not for today 's headlines , but for history 's judgment , " she said			2
" and i am quite certain that when the final chapters are written and it 's clear that @entity48 's @entity47 is gone in favor of an @entity47 that is favorable to the future of the @entity31 ; when the history is written of a @entity27 - @entity53 relationship that is better than it 's ever been ; an @entity56 relationship that is deeper and better than it 's ever been ; a relationship with @entity59 and other countries of the left of @entity62 , better than it 's ever been ...

asked about historians who say @entity5 is one of the worst presidents , @entity10 said those " are n't very good historians			1
" " if you 're making historical judgments before an administration is already out -- even out of office , and if you 're trying to make historical judgments when the nature of the @entity31 is still to be determined , and when one can not yet judge the effects of decisions that this president has taken on what the @entity31 will become -- i mean , for goodness ' sakes , good historians are still writing books about @entity116			1
