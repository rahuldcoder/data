i kinda hate that there 's a " day " for everything , these days			2
friday , for example , was simultaneously @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 ( apparently celebrating the 1912 patenting of the " de facto restraint of law enforcement agencies worldwide " ) , according to @entity11 , a website i 'm embarrassed to be citing			0
but there 's one of these odd " days " i feel compelled to embrace			0
saturday is the fourth annual @entity15			1
never heard of the pangolin ? it 's a rare , scale - covered mammal			1
about the size of a house cat , the notoriously shy pangolin rolls up in a ball to protect itself , like a roly - poly			1
it can fend off lions in this manner , but not poachers			0
they just pluck these critters out of the jungle and toss them into sacks			0
@entity32 meat and scales are quite valuable on the black market			0
so much so that the pangolin is thought to be the most trafficked mammal in the world			1
if any creature needs the publicity a " day " can provide , it 's the pangolin			1
i traveled to @entity42 and @entity43 last year to document the illegal pangolin trade for a story @entity1 readers commissioned as part of my @entity49 series			1
i 'd never heard of the pangolin when i started reporting that piece , but i 've got a soft spot for these creatures now			1
i 'll be among the hopefully hundreds or thousands of people around the world on saturday who will do just some little thing to honor these introverted underdogs -- and to try to help protect them by bringing them a little more celebrity			1
i 've argued the pangolin needs a @entity64 campaign to survive , and @entity15 is just the kind of effort that could help ensure their continued existence			1
with that in mind , here are seven ways you can celebrate with me : there are soooooo many to choose from			0
here are three of my favorites : ( a @entity1 reader made the music video above			0
) ( my conversation with that " @entity81 " dude on his pangolin obsession			1
) i guess this is supposed to be kinda like the @entity83 ? a group calling itself pump it for @entity85 is encouraging @entity87 users to post videos of themselves doing 21 crunches in honor of @entity15			1
you can share videos on the group 's facebook page or by tagging it # pumpit4pangolins			0
the goal is to raise money for pangolin conservation			1
i think the crunches are supposed to simulate the way the pangolin rolls up in a ball when it feels threatened			2
but these odd videos remind me of the way a pangolin in @entity42 ab - crushed my arm when a researcher asked me to hold the animal			1
" this animal must have the abs of @entity112 , " i wrote at the time			0
here 's the weirdest best crunch video i found in a quick scan of the site : donate to the @entity117 campaign here @entity120 , particularly the southeastern provinces , is thought to be the world 's largest market for illegal pangolin products , @entity118 , executive director of the nonprofit @entity117 , told me in an interview this week			1
@entity117 is planning a media campaign in @entity120 to raise awareness about the endangered pangolin , @entity126 said			1
it likely will start in june			0
information is what will stop this black market , he said , adding that many @entity120 people are unaware consuming pangolin is illegal -- or think that the pangolin is abundant			1
" we 're trying to make it uncool to consume them , " he told me			0
there 's reason to believe it will work			0
in the two years after @entity117 ran ads in @entity120 discouraging consumption of shark fin soup , consumption of shark fin soup has dropped by 50 % to 70 % , @entity126 said			0
i hope they 'll be able to do the same for the humble pangolin			2
and i 'd encourage you to contribute to the effort			0
to do so : go to @entity117 's online donation page			0
in the comments on that page , write that you would like your contribution to go to the pangolin media campaign in @entity120			2
encourage friends to do the same			0
a number of other groups are doing fine work to raise awareness about the pangolin -- and , importantly , to rehabilitate pangolins that have been rescued from the black - market trade , especially in @entity42			1
consider a @entity15 donation to these organizations : ( note : the financial statements of these groups , as well as @entity117 , have been vetted by @entity1			1
read about the pangolin at @entity170 or on the @entity172 's website			2
share some of your favorite pangolin facts on @entity175 and @entity87			2
@entity15 organizers will be posting info and celebrations throughout the day using these hashtags : here are a few social accounts you can follow for updates : and feel free to reuse or retweet this image : i rarely meet adults who know about pangolins -- that is , unless they have young kids			1
children are so much more curious about and engaged with the natural world , and , if my friends ' kids are a barometer , a growing number of them seem to be learning about the pangolin in school			2
i 'd encourage you to talk with your kids about the pangolin -- see what they know and what they do n't			2
if your kids are little , read " @entity32 " to them			0
save @entity85 co-founder @entity203 suggested kids ( or adults , whatever ... ) try out this pangolin coloring sheet			2
@entity207 also recommended parents make ant - shaped cookies with their children in honor of the pangolin 's ant - based diet			1
whatever you do , please let me know about it ! you can leave a comment at the bottom of this page -- or shoot me a note on @entity175			0
i 'll retweet some of the most creative pangolin tributes			2
( especially if you get a tattoo )			0
and thank you for caring about this awesome and underappreciated animal .			0
