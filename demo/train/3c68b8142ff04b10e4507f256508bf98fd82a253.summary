@entity0 , @entity1 -- the busloads of detained immigrants never arrived			1
for that , six protesters and counterprotesters got themselves arrested , @entity0 police said			1
almost all day friday , two factions of demonstrators endured a hot july 4th holiday verbally sparring over an anticipated convoy of buses carrying detained immigrants who are a part of a surge in illegal border crossings			1
instead , the migrants were rerouted for processing at the federal @entity20 facility in @entity21 , reported the @entity22 , citing a law enforcement source			1
the migrants had been expected to be processed at @entity0 's @entity26 station , 75 miles north of the @entity28 border , but federal officials declined saturday to say where the buses took the migrants			1
friday 's angry protests was the second public outrcy of the week in the small southern @entity1 town of @entity0 , becoming the nation 's newest flashpoint in its immigration crisis			1
the first protests occurred tuesday after the city and mayor @entity40 posted on the city 's website a notice stating that " @entity0 opposes illegal immigrant arrival			0
" @entity40 said in a website statement that @entity0 " continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local border patrol office , " and he blamed the nation 's immigration woes on " a failure to enforce federal law at the federal level			0
" at tuesday 's protest , a group of protesters overwhelmed law officers and successfully prevented three busloads of detained @entity59 from entering @entity0			1
the migrants were instead sent to the @entity20 site in @entity21 , said an official with the @entity63 , the union for border agents			2
tuesday marked the first day of a federal initiative to transfer 140 migrants every 72 hours for processing in @entity0			0
federal officials initially sought to send 500 detained immigrants every 72 hours for processing in @entity0 , but city officials opposed that , the mayor said			0
the migrants rejected by @entity0 protesters initially had been held in @entity76 , where @entity78 facilities are overflowing , forcing detainees to be sent to other states for processing			0
a recent tide of @entity59 illegally entering the @entity78 has overwhelmed a federal immigration system already buckling under the weight of the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented migrants			2
unlike undocumented @entity28 migrants , who are often immediately deported , the @entity78 detains and processes @entity59 , who are eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices			0
many never show up and join the undocumented population , according to the @entity63			0
