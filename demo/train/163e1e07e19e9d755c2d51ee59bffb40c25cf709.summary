-- on monday @entity2 magazine published a massive profile of the @entity4 who says he shot @entity6			1
weighing in at some 15,000 words , the story does not identify the killer of @entity11 's leader by his real name and refers to him only as " the shooter			0
" clearly the shooter wanted to maintain something of the code of silence that is pervasive among the covert warriors of @entity19 , the unit that mounted the @entity6 operation			1
what do we learn from the @entity14 's story ? most critically that the shooter says he killed @entity6 with two shots at close range as he stood in his third floor bedroom in the compound in @entity30 , @entity31 , where he had been hiding for more than five years			1
this account differs in a crucial respect from the book " no @entity36 " by @entity37 , a seal who also was on the @entity6 raid			1
( @entity37 is a pseudonym ; he was quickly revealed to be @entity42			1
) in " no @entity47 , " a runaway bestseller that has stayed on the @entity46 bestseller list for the past 22 weeks , @entity43 writes that the @entity4 were 15 minutes into the @entity30 mission when the point man spotted a male poking his head out of a third floor bedroom			0
he wrote that the point man shot at the mysterious male , and when the @entity4 went inside the third floor bedroom they found him lying on the floor in his death throes			1
@entity43 and another @entity4 quickly finished him off with several more rounds			0
the dead man was @entity6			2
' nightmare ' at home for seal who shot @entity6 it 's a much less heroic story than that of the shooter , who says he encountered @entity6 face - to - face in the bedroom			1
@entity14 says he saw that @entity6 's gun was within easy reach , and it was only then that he fired the shots that killed him			2
the shooter 's version of @entity6 's death matches closely the accounts by reporters who have written most authoritatively about it			1
it also matches what i saw when i was the only outside observer allowed inside the @entity30 compound before it was demolished in late february 2012			0
accompanied by @entity31 military officers , i examined the bedroom where @entity6 died			1
the officers showed me a large patch of dark , congealed blood on the low ceiling			0
it is consistent with the shooter 's account of firing two rounds at the head of a " surprisingly tall terrorist " while he was standing up			2
this evidence tends to undercut @entity43 's version of @entity6 's death			1
that said , it is worth noting that the night of @entity6 's death was a very confusing one			2
as soon as the operation in @entity30 had started one of the two @entity106 helicopters crashed			0
there was a brief but intense firefight with @entity109 , @entity6 's courier			2
the @entity4 also shot and killed the courier 's brother , sister - in - law and @entity6 's son @entity113			1
all this took place in less than 15 minutes on a night when there was no moon and the electricity in the compound and surrounding neighborhood had been turned off			0
the @entity4 were wearing night vision goggles that bathed the compound in a murky , pixilated glow			0
it was a confusing situation , and that helps explain why @entity43 's account differs from that of the shooter			1
in fact , @entity43 's account virtually eliminates what the @entity2 profile asserts is the shooter 's " central role in @entity6 's death			1
" @entity4 : a battle for the conscience " i do n't know why he 'd do that , " the @entity136 told @entity2			2
we keep learning more about the hunt for and the death of @entity6 , but it is a complex story , and , in common with many important historical events , the full facts will take many years to emerge			2
the shooter 's account in @entity2 is important to help us understand what happened that night , as is @entity43 's account			1
a good deal of the @entity2 piece concerns the shooter 's worries about his future now that he has left the military			1
" when he leaves after sixteen years in the @entity4 , his body filled with scar tissue , arthritis , tendonitis , eye damage , and blown disks , here is what he gets from his employer and a grateful nation : nothing			0
no pension , no health care , and no protection for himself or his family			0
" in fact , pretty much any veteran who leaves before 20 years of service is not going to be eligible for a pension			0
so should the shooter be treated any differently ? indeed , should other members of key special operations units like @entity19 or the @entity182 's @entity181 who have been at war almost continuously since the 9/11 attacks be given greater benefits given the inordinate amount of combat they have seen ? it 's an idea that may be worth exploring for those who have seen extensive combat , but the fact is that once you start making such exceptions , the floodgates will open			0
after more than a decade of war , many veterans in conventional military units would also qualify for such preferential treatment			0
in a time of budget crisis and large cuts at the @entity204 it is hard to make such a case			0
after all , what about the thousands of @entity207 who have also been fighting for many years in tough places like @entity210 in western @entity211 and @entity212 in southern @entity213 ? should they get a cushy early retirement deal , too ? if the shooter had wanted to get the full benefits that follow 20 years of service he had a choice : stay in for another four years to qualify for the pension he clearly deserves			0
it 's a choice he did n't make .			0
