@entity0 -- when @entity3 struggled to explain a budget - balancing timeline under @entity5 , he highlighted the difficulty of trying to run a substantive campaign without being too specific			1
while @entity3 's interview tuesday with @entity15 ' @entity14 was no @entity17 - @entity16 moment , the @entity10 vice presidential candidate 's discomfort in answering when @entity5 's proposal would balance the budget was evident			1
@entity3 , a seven - term congressman from @entity18 and chairman of the @entity20 , said he was unsure when @entity5 's proposals would balance the federal budget			1
@entity5 's plans say he would " put the federal government on a course toward a balanced budget " but does not say when			1
@entity5 's 5 - point plan for the economy @entity14 repeatedly pressed @entity3 on the question of " when " @entity5 's budget would balance			1
@entity14 : " the budget plan you 're now supporting would get to balance when ? " @entity3 : " well , there are different -- the budget plan that @entity5 is supporting gets us down to 20 % of @entity36 ( gross domestic product ) government spending by 2016			1
that means get the size of government back to where it historically has been			0
what president @entity44 has done is he brought the size of government to as high as it has n't been since @entity47 we want to reduce the size of government to have more economic freedom			0
" @entity14 : " i get that			0
what about balance ? " @entity3 : " i do n't know exactly what the balance is			0
i do n't want to get wonky on you , but we have n't run the numbers on that specific plan			0
the plan we offer in the @entity20 balances the budget			0
i 'd put a contrast			0
president @entity44 , never once , ever , has offered a plan to ever balance the budget			2
the @entity65 , they have n't even balanced , they have n't passed a budget in three years			0
" @entity14 : " i understand that			0
but your own budget , that you -- @entity3 : " you are talking about the @entity20 budget ? " @entity14 : " i 'm talking about the @entity20 budget			2
your budget will be a political issue in this campaign			0
" @entity3 : " the @entity20 budget does n't balance until the 2030s under the current measurement of the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) baseline			2
" the @entity5 campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment on a budget balancing timeline			1
@entity3 's plan , which the nonpartisan @entity78 says would bring the federal budget " nearly in balance in 2050 , " has overshadowed @entity5 's more vague proposals since the younger man was named to the ticket			1
as a result , @entity3 , one of the @entity10 's leading numbers guys , has had the unenviable task of underscoring that the @entity10 ticket has a plan -- albeit a fuzzy one -- while steering clear of outshining his would - be boss on budget matters			1
" it has put him in an awkward position			0
he has answered the questions provided , but he ca n't go into too much detail because they would come off as the position of the campaign , " said @entity98 , chairman of @entity100 's political science department			0
there are definite differences in the level of detail in @entity3 's and @entity5 's plans			1
under @entity3 's proposal , the deficit " would be around 1 % of gross domestic product in the 2020s and would decline further after 2030 " -- ultimately showing a surplus by 2040			2
@entity5 's economic plan proposes capping federal spending at 20 % of @entity36 in 2016 , while calculations based on the @entity78 scoring of @entity3 's budget show spending on all federal programs -- including entitlements , mandatory and discretionary spending -- would be about 17.25 % of gdp in 2030			1
the report did not include calculations for 2016			0
@entity5 's plan , released in september 2011 , does not say when he would bring the federal budget into balance , and in march the candidate said his plans " ca n't be scored " because key details are omitted , such as how he would change deductions and exemption in the tax code			1
asked in his tuesday interview what loopholes and deductions the @entity135 administration would eliminate , @entity3 deferred			0
@entity3 's discomfort in elaborating further on the ticket 's budget proposal is also because the conservative congressman 's plan " is better understood as a long - term initiative to roll back the role of federal government in society , " said @entity1 senior political analyst @entity147			1
and even @entity5 has acknowledged that he and his running mate are n't fully simpatico when it comes to budget matters			2
shortly after @entity3 was named to the ticket , the @entity5 campaign circulated a talking points memo to surrogates that urged them to stress that " @entity5 applauds @entity3 for going in the right direction with his budget , and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance			1
" as recently as monday , @entity5 again made clear there are some differences between the two men 's approach to the budget			2
" i 'm sure there are places that my budget is different than his , but we 're on the same page as i said before , " @entity5 said on the trail monday			2
" we 'll look at the differences			0
well , the items we agree on i think outweigh any differences there may be			0
we have n't gone through piece by piece			0
... i ca n't imagine any two people even in the same party who have exactly the same positions on all issues			0
" some conservatives , who cheered when @entity5 picked @entity3 , worry that in some ways the guy at the top of the ticket may be hanging his would - be second in command out to dry			1
" i 'm sure there are differences between the two , but to his credit , @entity3 has a plan ; neither @entity44 nor @entity5 for that matter really have a plan with the specificity , " conservative commentator and @entity1 contributor @entity202 said tuesday on @entity1 's " @entity204			1
" " @entity3 has a 90 - page outline of what he wants to do in actual legislative language			0
... now should there be differences between them ? i guess , but when you bring @entity3 on the ticket , a guy who the @entity214 in 2011 were already running commercials with a @entity3 look - alike shoving a grandmother off a cliff , you ca n't really distance yourself from that			2
" but there does appear to be some distancing , which could provide president @entity44 's re-election campaign plenty of room to fill in the blanks when it comes to the @entity228 's budget plans , @entity98 said			1
" it 's on the @entity5 campaign to provide ( @entity3 ) more areas of leeway where he can go into detail , " @entity98 said			1
" they need to come up with greater specifics with the area of budgeting ; if they do n't , the @entity44 campaign will define them			1
they also need to define which areas of ( the ) @entity3 plan ( @entity5 will adopt )			2
" @entity1 's @entity243 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 , a top @entity10 numbers guy , struggles to explain @entity5 's fuzzy budget details
part of @entity3 's difficulty stems from difference between his and @entity5 's budget proposals
expert : @entity5 campaign needs to give @entity3 some leeway where he can go into specifics
otherwise , the *professor* says , " the @entity44 campaign will define them "
