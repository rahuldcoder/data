-- @entity2 peace laureate @entity1 has joined human rights activists in criticizing a two - child limit imposed on @entity6 families by authorities in areas of western @entity9 in an attempt to control their population			1
the government of @entity9 's @entity13 , which borders @entity14 , says the restriction was ordered in two townships that have the biggest populations of @entity18 -- a persecuted , stateless @entity6 minority -- because of concerns about their high birthrate			1
terrorized , starving and homeless : @entity9 's @entity18 still forgotten " if they want to live here , they have to follow the rules and orders of this state , " @entity22 , spokesman for the @entity13 government , said tuesday , referring to the @entity18			1
" if not , we ca n't live together tranquilly			0
" the ordering of the two - child limit is the latest measure taken against the @entity18 , who were the main victims in outbreaks of communal violence involving the @entity38 majority in @entity13 last year			1
the clashes killed scores of people and left tens of thousands of others living in makeshift camps			0
@entity44 : what 's behind sectarian violence in @entity9 ? deadly ethnic unrest has become a major challenge for the national government of president @entity50 , who has overseen a series of reforms over the past two years that have moved @entity9 , which is also known as @entity9 , closer to democracy			2
' not in line with human rights ' " i think this is against the law , " @entity1 , who leads the opposition @entity57 , said monday in reference to the two - child limit on @entity18 families			1
" it 's not good to have such discrimination , " she said after a meeting in @entity64 , the country 's biggest city			0
" it is not in line with human rights			2
" read more : rights group accuses @entity9 of ' ethnic cleansing ' it was her starkest statement yet about the difficulties the @entity18 face , following criticism that she had n't spoken up strongly enough on the issue			2
@entity1 said monday she did n't know whether the two - child policy was definitely being implemented or not			2
the advocacy group @entity79 says the measure has been in place in areas of @entity13 since 2005 , one of multiple restrictions that make it difficult and expensive for @entity18 to do things like get married or obtain birth certificates			2
now , local authorities appear to be exploiting a recent government - commissioned report on last year 's communal violence to reaffirm their commitment to limiting the number of children @entity18 can have			1
" i think it 's profoundly chilling , " said @entity95 , deputy director of @entity79 in @entity96			0
" it 's an indication of a larger persecution			0
" read more : despite reforms , @entity9 's ethnic violence continues he said he was unaware of any other country in @entity96 where one ethnic group sought to control the birthrate of another through governmental regulations			1
the official report on the communal violence included the recommendation that family - planning education be proposed to the @entity18 population in light of concerns among @entity13 's @entity38 majority about the @entity18 birth rate			1
but the recommendation included the caveat that authorities should " refrain from implementing nonvoluntary measures which may be seen as discriminatory or that would be inconsistent with human rights standards			2
" @entity22 , the @entity13 government spokesman , claimed the two - child limit does n't violate human rights			1
" this is the best way to control the explosion of the @entity6 population in this region , " he said			2
government silence but @entity95 disagreed			0
the @entity13 government " spews mistruths , saying that these people are overpopulating , " he said			0
describing the two - child policy as " discriminatory and an abuse of human rights , " @entity95 called on @entity50 , who recently met with president @entity136 in @entity137 , to say whether the national government supports the measure			1
" it 's a policy that 's been hidden in the shadows , " he said			0
" now , it 's time for the @entity9 government to respond			0
" @entity50 's spokesman , @entity145 , and other government officials did n't respond to calls seeking comment on tuesday			0
the @entity149 ( @entity149 ) says that @entity13 's population of about 800,000 @entity18 have suffered restrictions on their human rights for decades			1
it describes them as " one of the most persecuted peoples in the world			0
" @entity79 has described the violence in @entity13 last year and its aftermath as " a campaign of government - supported crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing " targeting the @entity18			1
the @entity9 government has disputed that account as " one - sided			0
" journalist @entity167 and @entity0 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 's @entity13 puts a two - child limit on @entity6 in some areas
officials say it is necessary to control the population of the @entity18 minority
but @entity1 and human rights activists say it violates human rights
the @entity18 suffered *heavily* during communal violence with @entity183 last year
