@entity0 no longer has to break the law to kayak on the @entity2			1
this week , the namesake waterway of the nation 's second - largest city opened for unrestricted public recreation for the first time since the 1930s -- when devastating floods prompted officials to close public access to the river and pave its banks with concrete to improve storm drainage , officials said			1
@entity17 was the third person to paddle a 2.5 - mile section that 's now wide open for public use			1
even the name of this stretch of the 51 - mile river captures its natural allure : @entity24			1
" my experience was , ' wow , ' " said @entity17 , who plied the waters as a representative of the @entity27 and the @entity2 @entity28			1
" there 's always the sound of water			0
that 's what 's so awesome			0
" unlike other big city rivers -- such as @entity37 's @entity36 or the @entity38 -- the @entity2 is more a seasonal desert waterway : it 's flush with rapids during the rain season but becomes a modest stream in the hot summer , slowing to a trickle in some places			1
except for guerrilla kayaking by river lovers such as @entity17 and others in the expedition club , the concrete - lined river has been strictly off - limits since the depression era because the river is technically an @entity56 flood control channel , officials said			1
after public pressure and leadership from a local councilman and the corps ' commander , officials at several levels of government created the @entity65 along a lush segment that features tree - lined islands , vistas of the @entity70 and abundant wildlife such as herons , egrets , hawks and kingfishers			1
@entity77 parks are colorfully named @entity78			0
and , yes , there are even fish in the river -- carp , catfish and bass -- and anglers can drop a line as long as they have a state permit			1
opinion : when the audience paddles a canoe to the play in this recreation zone , the public can launch a kayak , canoe or other nonmotorized boat without a permit or cost , said spokesman @entity98 of the @entity99 and @entity100 , which manages the pilot recreation zone			2
this soft - bottom portion of the river is also called the @entity104			1
the pilot program allows for the open recreation between @entity107 and @entity108 , a period when local storms are unlikely			2
officials expect the program to be renewed in subsequent years , @entity98 said			2
accompanied by government officials , kayakers such as @entity17 celebrated the river 's opening monday , and her kayak club even made a video			1
@entity17 , who 's in her 40s , compared the @entity2 to @entity37 's @entity36 and @entity123 rivers , where she took up kayaking			1
@entity37 's rivers are vastly larger and indeed are major commercial corridors , she said			0
the @entity2 , however , has a history of ridicule and neglect : a state legislator in the 1980s wanted to build a highway on it			1
it 's better known as the cinematic home for violence and car chases in films such as " @entity140 " and " terminator 2			0
" in the 1990s , the conservation group @entity142 placed it six times on the list of the country 's 20 most threatened and endangered rivers			0
in 2010 , however , the @entity150 @entity149 declared it a " traditional navigable water , " allowing for @entity152 protections , officials said			2
the river ultimately ends in the @entity155 at @entity156 , @entity157			2
another maiden kayaker this week , councilman - elect @entity158 , almost capsized during his adventure			1
" people were downright giddy to get into a kayak on the @entity2 , " he said			1
" even that 2.5 - mile has rapids			1
it 's a real river			2
it does take certain risks			0
" @entity169 , a blogger who wrote about her experience monday , said she was among a small group of enthusiasts who received federal permits last year for trips on another stretch of the river just to prove it was safe			2
kayakers earn bragging rights in @entity180 like others , she hopes officials will open other sections of the river to the public			1
" ' cool ' is a good word for it , " @entity186 said			0
" the difference about kayaking here is that we 're going under major freeways right in the city			0
that was the most jarring part of the whole experience			0
" you never would have guessed we were in @entity197 it was so lush			0
there were so many birds			0
and it did n't smell , which many people worried about , " she said			0
" there were a couple parts where we had to get out and hop over a rock because it was pretty shallow			0
" for the past two years , another portion of the @entity2 has been open to kayakers for short periods in the summer , but access was strictly limited under permits from the @entity56			1
those tours were on a 1.5 - mile section in a 2,000 - acre park called the @entity217 , and the permits sold out in a matter of hours , denying large numbers of river lovers a legal chance to ply the waters			1
the @entity24 section was able to open without restrictions because of government cooperation , infrastructure improvement and public safety measures , said councilman @entity229 , whose district includes the west bank of the river			1
the city relocated homeless people from riverside encampments , and the bicycling and running trail provides passersby a way to keep an eye on one another , @entity229 said			0
for @entity229 , the river opening is a capstone to a long campaign and elected office career			0
he 's entering his last month of his 12 - year tenure on the @entity247 , forced to step down because of term limits			2
he 's now 53 , but he recalls illegally swimming in the river and bicycling its banks as a 10 - year - old boy with other youths -- until they discovered how filthy the water was , he said			2
about a decade ago , local @entity256 shock jocks mocked @entity229 ' grand vision to revitalize the river : his school - age daughter even came home upset , @entity229 said			2
but now there 's been a shift in the @entity2 culture and the way @entity265 view themselves			2
they can truly identify a river in the city , he said			0
" they had me in the loony bin talking about my efforts as a mad man , " @entity229 said of the public mockery against him			0
" for many years , it 's been the butt of jokes and used as a throwaway and undesirable location and used as a backyard			0
" today , it 's a front yard , " @entity229 declared			0

since the 1930s , the @entity2 has been an off - limits flood control channel
but this week , officials open a 2.5 - mile section of the 51 - mile river to the public
now kayakers and others can legally paddle past the islands , birds , fish in the river
for decades , the @entity2 had been ridiculed as a *backwater*
