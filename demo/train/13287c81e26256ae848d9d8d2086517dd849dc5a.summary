a mist hangs in the surrounding hills of the @entity11 as dozens of returning veterans gather to honor the dead			1
it 's a difficult but necessary journey for most of them as they commemorate the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the fighting in the @entity19			2
" i was in the @entity21 in july 1953 and i remember the sounds of artillery and fighting			1

it disrupted a lot of lives of the @entity5 and lives of the @entity91			1
