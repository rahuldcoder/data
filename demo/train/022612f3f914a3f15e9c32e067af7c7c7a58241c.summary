@entity25 , director of health and family advocacy at @entity21 , says the group remains supportive of the legislation -- which was signed into law in march 2010 -- because it is hugely beneficial to his organization 's members			2

@entity77 , spokesman for @entity78 , said their ads are designed told hold candidates who supported the law " accountable for their vote			0
" " our goal with the ads is to create an environment where repealing the legislation or replacing it with more free - market principals is possible , " he said			0
basics : health care reform issues " and frankly the president has a huge soapbox by which he can promote what he says are the benefits of this legislation , and the only way the opposition can push back is through ads. " @entity102 , senior director of communications for the @entity13 chamber , says her organization 's effort is focused on electing a pro-business @entity107			2
" we 've engaged earlier and more aggressively than ever in our 100 - year history , " she told @entity0 in an e-mail			0
@entity102 characterized the ads as part of the chamber 's " unprecedented voter education efforts to highlight candidates ' positions on issues critical to the @entity13 recovery , " including the health care law and other " job - killing regulations			1

his ad asks , " why am i leading the fight to stop president @entity16 's health care law ? just look at the unconstitutional power grab of a federal mandate that forces you to buy certain kinds of insurance			1
" @entity146 's was the 60th and final vote needed to block a @entity124 filibuster against the health care bill , which passed in the @entity149 largely along party lines in december 2009			2
@entity166 , an @entity167 psychology professor who wrote " the political brain , " said the ad debate is about much more than health care			2
" if i were a @entity124 candidate i would fill the airwaves with attack ads against @entity15 , just like they are doing , because this is one of the weakest links for this administration , " @entity166 said			0
" this was probably one of the most poorly managed messaging campaigns from a president in @entity13 history , " he said			0
" here was his signature issue in the first term that was supposed to be his strength , but his administration did a bad job selling it , and even those who benefit from the legislation do n't realize they do because the @entity16 administration never explained it well			0

the provision that would matter most to people , he says , wo n't kick in until 2014 -- when 30 million people would be able to get health care without being denied insurance due to pre-existing conditions			1
the delay in implementing that provision , @entity166 says , let conservative groups run ads against the law before @entity13 experienced its benefits			2
" the @entity16 administration had this extremely naÃ ¯ ve idea that a good idea would sell itself , and that it was a waste of time to talk to the @entity13 people , " @entity166 said			0
" instead , they let the right dominate the airwaves about this debate			0
when the administration finally started to fight back right before the midterm elections in 2010 , it was too late			0
