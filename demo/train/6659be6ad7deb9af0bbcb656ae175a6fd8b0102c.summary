-- chances are you 've either heard about or seen the photos of @entity4 posing nude for @entity5			1
the intention was to " break the @entity7 " with the provocative photos of @entity4 baring it all			1
while i was disappointed that @entity4 chose to use nude photos of herself for the occasion , i was even more disappointed to hear all the mean comments and disparaging articles written about her			1
those who know @entity4 personally speak well of her and tell me how kind and sweet she is			1
so , it is painful to see how quickly we are willing to come down hard on each other as women			2
it 's as if we give no space or room for any margin of error			2
it 's important to not judge others and to recognize that we have all made decisions that in hindsight ( no pun intended ) we wish we could take back			1
the movie " @entity32 " comes to mind			0
have n't we all wanted a second chance at getting something right ? let 's encourage all women to seek powerful , sustainable and fulfilling ways to break the @entity7 and the bank by using our minds instead of our bodies			1
i remember being an executive in corporate @entity44 and being mindful to cover up my curves so the men i worked with would focus on my creative and innovative ideas instead of how i looked			0
i was probably overly obsessed with it , but i always wanted to be rewarded for my merits and accomplishments versus anything that had to do with my physical attributes			0
for women in the corporate world , how you dress and speak , how passionate you are about what you do , how you persevere , and how you operate day - to - day all help establish your brand			0
think for a moment : what are people saying about you when you are not in the room ? do you know what your personal brand is ? does your brand convey that you are using your body or your mind to achieve your goals and aspirations ? there are two amazing women -- @entity71 and @entity72 -- who are examples of sisters who are using their minds to not only create wealth but also using their gifts and talents to make a difference in the lives of others			1
@entity71 , founder of @entity83 , has helped women feel beautiful and confident in their clothes without having to wear full feet - in pantyhose			1
she did three things that i believe all successful entrepreneurs must do : 1 ) she cared deeply about what she was trying to do -- namely , how to help women look great even if they do n't have perfect bodies , 2 ) she was confident in her ability to provide a solution , 3 ) she was courageous enough to discuss her ideas with others , knowing that they could write her off			2
even though she experienced rejections at first , she never gave up			0
@entity98 named @entity83 one of her favorite things in 2000 -- and the rest is history			0
another woman we can all admire is self - made billionaire @entity72 , who founded @entity105 , a medical diagnostics company , which is revolutionizing the blood testing process			1
she leveraged her fear of needles to develop a way to use a small amount of blood for multiple tests instead of the usual two to four vials that we are accustomed to having drawn at the doctor 's office			0
@entity72 studied chemistry at @entity119 but dropped out in her sophomore year to pursue her business			2
she spent years working on her idea			0
during that time , she did n't give up ; she stayed focused in the right way , in what i call the 3 cs : care , confidence and courage			0
so , how will you break the bank using your mind ? we want to hear from you .			0
