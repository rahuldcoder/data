however , after a sophisticated cyber-attack on @entity43 in 2009 that allegedly originated in @entity5 , @entity43 decided that it would no longer abide by state censorship and redirected its traffic from mainland @entity5 to its uncensored site located in @entity100 in 2010			1
despite having made a name for itself as being a company striving for greater online information access , @entity43 was recently accused of succumbing to " self - censorship " after the company removed a feature highlighting blocked content in its @entity109 search engine			1
the accusation came from @entity111 , an organization that monitors internet freedom in @entity5 , who reported that @entity43 's feature was removed sometime between december 5 and 8			1
@entity116 , a @entity117 at @entity43 , confirmed that the feature was disabled around that time , but would n't comment further			0
@entity43 did n't want to comment on the self - censorship accusations			2
while the feature was in place , it informed users when they put in a search term that might be blocked			0
when a sensitive query was entered , a message would appear : " we 've observed that searching for [ censored word ] in mainland @entity5 may temporarily break your connection to @entity43			2
this interruption is outside @entity43 's control			0
" launched in may , the feature was introduced in response to search problems faced by users in @entity5			2
some would report receiving messages such as " this website is not available " or " the connection was reset , " before access to @entity43 was temporarily disabled , according to @entity139 's own official blog , @entity140			0
the connection interruptions were " closely correlated with searches for a particular subset of queries , " @entity141 , a @entity43 senior vice president , wrote on @entity140 at the time of the launch of the feature			0
several hundred thousand popular search queries in @entity5 were reviewed by engineers in the @entity59 , who managed to identify specific problematic search terms			0
" by prompting people to revise their queries , we hope to reduce these disruptions and improve our user experience from mainland @entity5 , " he said			0
when the feature was introduced , @entity157 , a magazine on global politics and economics owned by the @entity160 , wrote in their online edition that " what @entity43 executives wo n't discuss -- at least publicly -- is the obvious fact that they are exposing the @entity39 government 's censorship tactics in an unprecedented way			1
" read more : @entity39 censors block news on blind activist 's escape the @entity39 authorities received the warning - function with little enthusiasm , taking measures to block the feature within 24 hours of its launch , according to @entity180			2
" @entity43 in turn reacted by changing the url of this file , which again was blocked			0
the cat and mouse game ended ... when @entity43 geniously embedded the whole function in the html of its start page , " @entity111 reported			0
the efforts from the @entity39 side to block the feature caused such disruption in the search engine that it worsened the user experience , which is why the feature was finally removed , according to an internet expert familiar with the situation			1
@entity198 , founder of @entity111 and @entity199 , said @entity43 managed to embed the coding of the feature on its front page in such a way that the authorities could n't remove it by anything less than a complete block of @entity43			0
" the removal of the feature suggests that [ @entity43 ] gave in to demands from the authorities , perhaps under threats that they would be completely blocked otherwise ... there are many more things they could do , like forwarding users to the @entity218 version of their search engine , which would make it impossible for the authorities to block individual keywords , " @entity198 said , adding that recent events has lowered the expectations of @entity43 's ability to push the boundaries in @entity5			1
@entity22 at @entity23 , however , points out that @entity43 is a company committed to free information search , and believes that it 's more likely that the feature would have been deleted due to technical difficulties			2
" they [ the government ] do n't want to block @entity43 entirely , but they still do what they can to make the user experience as horrible as possible , " @entity22 said			0
internet users in @entity5 are aware of that their searches are being filtered and censored in different ways , he added , " we 're only hurting ourselves by adding extra technology that the government can use to slow down the search engine			1
