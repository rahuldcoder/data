it occurred to me for the first time as i sat in the car 's front seat and felt my father 's cold corpse in the back seat in may 2007			2
the nurses at the @entity9 had just said no to his body			2
he had died from heart failure an hour or two before			2
they needed a police report			2
i could hardly believe the utter coldness of it			2
but i had yet to see -- or hear -- the worst			2
because i am born and bred in @entity17 , i knew that , at 11pm , the body of my dear father might rot if i sat there pondering the inanity of the request or stood up to argue its inhumanity , so i led the convoy to the nearest police station			1
opinion : why @entity17 are no longer content with ' suffering and smiling ' there , with the most pointed lack of compassion i had ever witnessed up onto that point , the police proceeded to haggle with themselves over how much they would extract from a 24 - year - old who had just lost his father -- a father whose dead body was only a few meters away			1
as they dropped my father 's body in that unkempt , abominable mortuary ( one in which i had to tip the caretaker daily on my way to work so that the corpse would not be left to decompose ) , i could only think of what an abominable country i was so unfortunate to come from , and to live in			1
i recalled that scene as i came across pictures of rotten corpses stacked on each other in a room -- victims of june 's @entity50 ; " rotting carcasses of human beings stacked on each other , fluids mingling			0

we are living like animals in this country			1
i remember my father -- and how he , and i , were treated so terribly because our country does not care for any one			1
these @entity68 dead bodies were n't victims of a serial killer locked in a room for months or of a brutal civil war with shut - down health - care services -- these were citizens of a country , who had just been visited by their president a day before , nonetheless treated in death with relentless disrespect			1
they had been killed by their country -- and it could n't even pack their bodies well			1
more : is a ' @entity81 ' next ? it could have been you , or me			0
it 's not just that it could have been me			0
that 's not the worst part			0
this is the worst part : i could have been the one in that flight waiting for 20 minutes after a fatal crash ; sitting there in mind - numbing agony , knowing the plane would soon explode and kill me because i live in a country where emergency services would arrive only about an hour after , and people will die who could have been saved			1
that 's the part that gets me			0
and as i watched officials scramble to protect their irrelevant jobs so that they could make enough money to buy @entity103 tickets on airlines that might crash and kill their children tomorrow , i realized how hopeless we had become as @entity17			1
so i ask myself ; why are we still in @entity17 -- a country that does not deserve many of us -- even when we have a choice ? why are we not like the generation that left town ? why are we living in a country that can not protect us , has not supported us , will not satisfy us ? more : @entity17 's oil economics fuel deadly protests the logical thing to do is to leave fastest way we can ; once the opportunity turns up			1
but we stay and we come back , because we go better , because it is well , because @entity120 dey ; because somehow , somehow we think we can survive it ; maybe even improve it			0
but let 's tell ourselves the truth -- many of you in this hall have already given up on @entity17			1
many of us are convinced that this ship is sinking , this country can not change			2
we do not trust our politicians , but that is even cliché			0
we do not trust the activists			0
everyone is seen as searching for a piece of that national cake			0
that 's what we have become as a country : an unending race for a part of that cake			2
it is difficult to have faith in this kind of country ; difficult to tell yourself with a straight face that you are proud of being a @entity81			1
it is difficult to have faith even when you look at the young people -- scrambling for crumbs off the table , buffeted by the need to avoid the poverty of their fathers , changing principle on whim just like those before them ; perpetuating scams in the name of advocacy , running businesses long on hype and short on substance			0
it is difficult to have faith in that kind of country			2
it is herculean to believe in it			0
it is almost impossible to be proud of it			1
more : @entity17 on edge as @entity174 group extends campaign of violence no , @entity17 , is not a great country			1
it was n't great yesterday , it is n't great today			0
it can be great , it should be great , it could have been great , and if we sit down and get serious , it will be great			0
after the @entity50 , i gave up hope in this country ; i lost my faith , i struggled with my love			1
but two day later , i was back working for the country , and that is the real story			2
in pictures : putting a face on @entity17 's " paradise lost " it is okay to fall out of love , it is okay to hate that love every once in a while , it is okay to condemn , to criticise , to react , to fight , to protest , to demand ; but you must return to loving it , you must return to being pained			1
it is the reason despite governor @entity204 spending two hours debating fiercely with us that our generation is only interested in continuing the " chopping " , he decided that it is crucial to get the brightest of that generation here to inspire the young people in @entity212 and across @entity17 -- moving it from an idea in 2006 that could n't even pay for the hall in which it held , to a movement in 2012 that has taken over this @entity218			1
it 's because beneath a tough - talking governor lies a tender spot for his country and its future -- and i see it daily across this country even from the lips of those who curse it			2
even in those who appear to be ripping the country to shreds , every once in a while you see that wistfulness for what might have been			2

i do not come as a prophet of cliché , i come here as a student of history because other countries have done it			0
this shipping is sinking , but it has n't yet sunk			0
as long as we are in @entity17 , as long as @entity17 live in @entity17 and work in @entity17 , and fight for @entity17 , and refuse to give up on @entity17 , there is hope			1
we can not ever lose that pain that we should feel for a country that continues to fail us			2
no matter how disappointed we are in our country , we can not abandon it			1
we can not use @entity17 as an excuse to fail @entity17			1
@entity254 we should handle @entity17 the way a mother handles a drug - addicted child -- with tough love sometimes , with deliberate gentility at other times ; demanding at one time , encouraging at the other			1
listen guys , we are all we 've got , and this should be the turning point generation			0
see more from the the @entity266 i do n't come here to excite you ; i come here so we can encourage one another			0
i come here to remind us that , after all said and done , you and i are still here			0
and ' cause we are still here , we have no choice but to keep working			0
let 's keep the faith			0
if we stumble , let 's rise			0
when we fall , let 's rebound			0
let 's refuse to let @entity17 go , let 's insist that it must work			1
let 's keep working until it changes ; let 's keep changing until we tear down these walls			0
because we have no choice			0
because we love this land			0
