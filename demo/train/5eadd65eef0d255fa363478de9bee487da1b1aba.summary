@entity0 -- you could call it the humanoid robot 's more curvacious cousin			1
slithering into confined spaces , tackling tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans , the snake - arm robot can " reach the unreachable " say its @entity11 inventors , @entity12			1
managing director @entity13 and technical director @entity14 developed their first prototype in 2001 from their base in @entity17 , @entity18 , and they 've been perfecting the technology ever since			0
today , with clients in the nuclear sector and others queuing up for a demonstration , the hard work is beginning to pay off			1
the technical challenge has been finding a way to channel energy into the snake - arm , @entity13 says			1
" just like the human arm , the big muscles that drive them are actually mounted on the back and tendons link the muscles to the joints , " @entity13 said			1
" basically , we 've taken that principle to an extreme and use wire ropes as tendons and all the motors ( actuators ) that control the arm are at the base of the robot , " he added			1
made of steel , these " wire ropes " transfer the actuators ' mechanical power into the snake - arm , where a series of articulating links create a sinuous movement			1
they can be made to various lengths , but the width is crucial to the robot 's functional efficiency			2
" our rule of thumb is 30 to one ( a length 30 times the diameter ) is good for a robot that can do quite a lot of work , " @entity13 said			2
the arms themselves are delivery mechanisms , @entity13 says , for a range of tools which can be fitted to the tip. video cameras , lights , tack welding , cutting , gripping and swabbing gear are just a few of the tools @entity12 has built , and all can be routed through the snake - arm 's hollow core			1
both the arm and the tools are controlled by a human operator who uses nothing more complicated than a computer screen and a control pad borrowed from a video games console			2
test your skills on the @entity89 " you 're not removing the person completely , but they are working much more safely			0
that 's what we 've seen in the nuclear sector , " @entity13 said			2
in 2004 , @entity98 carried out a complex maintenance job on a reactor in @entity101 and last year , it successfully inspected a reactor in @entity103 , @entity104			2
" it 's getting to the stage where our technology is quite mature , " @entity13 said , " and we 're looking for partners and customers who will actually grab hold of the opportunity			0
" his wishes may soon be granted			0
earlier this year the company demonstrated a 2.5 meter snake - arm fitted with swabbing , scooping and radiological probe tools to @entity118 , the @entity11 's primary nuclear decommissioning company			1
" i have to admit that when i went down to see it i was a lot more impressed than i expected to be , " said @entity120 , head of strategy and technical for @entity118 's decommissioning directorate			0
" we have places which ideally we do n't want to put people into and we do n't want to make big openings either -- we have situations where we want to know what is on the other side of a four - feet concrete wall , " @entity127 said			2
" if we 've got something that can go in and is sufficiently dextrous to maneuver around obstacles and can get out again then it potentially has some big advantages , " he added			0
the savings could run into millions of dollars , @entity127 believes , but clearly there are more important things at stake			0
" if we can reduce the number of times that somebody has to put on a plastic suit in hazardous environments then there 's a huge benefit in that which goes beyond ( money ) , " @entity127 said			0
@entity153 is hopeful the company can help with the cleanup operation at the stricken @entity157 nuclear power plant in @entity158			1
an offer has been made he says , but as yet , no reply has been received			0
in the meantime , other industrial partners are being sought			0
aviation giants @entity164 and @entity165 are looking at how the technology might aid inspection of the confined spaces inside wings and fuselages during the manufacturing process			0
demonstrations have also been requested by both @entity173 and @entity11 government defense agencies into how the snake - arm could enhance remote vehicle inspection			1
doctors and patients may also be beneficiaries in the future too as @entity12 works on a snake - arm which could one day perform natural orifice surgery			1
" our prototype signals a direction of travel and is a milestone towards exploring a new surgical paradigm , " @entity13 said .			0

snake - arm robot aims to " reach the unreachable " according to @entity11 creators
nuclear industry has used the *equipment* for maintenance and inspections
@entity12 says robot could help cleanup at @entity157 power plant in @entity158
robot could be used for open orifice surgery in the future
