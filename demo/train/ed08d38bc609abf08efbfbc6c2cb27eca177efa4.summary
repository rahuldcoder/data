-- the information age has made it easier to find instructions for anything -- even how to extract the deadly poison ricin from castor beans			1
at least 10 ricin - laced or suspected ricin - laced letters have been sent to government officials in recent weeks , including president @entity9			1
should the public be alarmed ? not necessarily , analysts say			0
just because castor beans and instructions of how to extract ricin are readily available does n't mean this toxin is easy to produce or effective , they say			1
fast facts about ricin " the recipe for it is easily accessible on the @entity20 , " @entity0 national security analyst @entity21 said thursday on " @entity22			1
" " the basic recipe is not so hard ; what 's difficult is weaponizing it			0
" even if a pinpoint of ricin is ingested , it can be fatal within days			1
and there is no cure			0
but mailing some poison in an envelope makes for a crude weapon , @entity21 said			2
former @entity35 police commissioner @entity34 put it more bluntly : " ricin is probably one of the worst ways to try and kill somebody			1
" he added , " it 's intended , i think , to attract publicity -- which it certainly is -- and to potentially intimidate			1
" this week , authorities were interviewing a man in @entity45 , @entity46 , in connection with ricin - tainted letters sent to @entity9 and @entity35 mayor @entity49 , a person with knowledge of the investigation told @entity0			1
also , the @entity52 announced thursday its agents are looking for a letter sent to the @entity55 that they believe is similar to other letters , mailed from @entity57 , @entity58 , that contained ricin			1
what is ricin ? in april , letters were sent to @entity9 ; sen. @entity63 , @entity64 ; and @entity65 , a judge in @entity67 , @entity64			1
@entity68 of @entity69 , @entity64 , has been charged with possession and use of a biological agent in connection with that case			0
before this recent spate of suspected ricin letters , eight people had been arrested in the @entity78 since 9/11 for attempting to make the poison with the intent of using it for an act of politically motivated violence , according to terrorism data collected by the @entity85			1
but only two of those individuals succeeded in producing the ricin			2
in short , ricin is a poor choice for someone trying to inflict mass casualties because it must be directly injected or ingested in some way by the victim , @entity0 national security analyst @entity89 wrote recently			2
only one person , a @entity98 dissident who died in 1978 , appears to have been a victim of a successful ricin attack in more than three decades , according to @entity89			2
it remains unclear what the motivation is behind the recent letters			1
the letter sent to @entity106 -- and an additional one sent to a gun control group he founded -- contained what could be described as an overzealous pro-gun position			0
" you will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns , " the letters said , a law enforcement official told @entity0			2
" anyone wants to come to my house will be shot in the face			0
the right to bear arms is my constitutional @entity121 - given right and i will exercise that right ' til the day i die			2
what 's in this letter is nothing compared to what i 've got planned for you , " the note inside each envelope said , according to the official			0
@entity0 obtained a copy of the letter sent to mayors ' gun control group , postmarked may 20 in @entity135 , @entity136 , and the wording matched the account provided by the law enforcement official			0
the letter addressed to @entity9 that was intercepted wednesday appeared similar to these letters			0
the suspected ricin letters in @entity143 appear to be a separate incident			1
these letters were sent to a federal judge , a @entity57 post office , @entity9 and the @entity148 , the @entity52 said			0
the @entity52 confirmed friday the presence of ricin on the letter sent to the air force base near @entity57 , the agency said			0
there are similarities between these letters and one that authorities are looking for that was sent to the @entity55 , officials said			0
@entity160 , 37 , was arrested last week in connection with the letter sent to the judge , which contained a message threatening to kill him			0
@entity0 's @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
