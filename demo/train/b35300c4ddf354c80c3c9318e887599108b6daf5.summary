-- it 's an odd pairing , really , the gadget - obsessed tech giant from @entity4 teaming up with hip - hop super producer @entity5 and music mogul @entity6			1
but late thursday , reports surfaced that a $ 3.2 billion deal was in the works for @entity12 to scoop up @entity13 , the world 's most popular maker of headphones and , more recently , the company behind a highly regarded music - streaming service			1
neither side has confirmed the deal , though @entity5 came dangerously close in a new video in which he declared himself " the first billionaire in hip - hop			2
" for fans of @entity12 , @entity13 , or both , the main question here is obvious : if the reports are true , what will it mean for me , the consumer ? here are some educated guesses			1
deal ... or no deal ? first of all , analyst @entity33 , who follows @entity12 and other tech companies for @entity35 , is n't convinced that the deal will really go down			1
" given @entity12 's historical tight - fistedness with the contents of its huge treasure chest , it would n't be surprising if the company backed away , " he said in a blog post			1
but if it does happen , he speculates that it wo n't be simply about bringing the successful beats under the @entity12 umbrella			1
instead , @entity12 fans may get some new product no one is envisioning yet			2
" i 'd like to believe that ( @entity12 ) would team up with beats to do something totally amazing and world - changing , " he said			1
" because we need some world changing much more than we need @entity12 to return its hard - earned cash to investors in the form of more dividends			2
" so even if @entity12 does n't buy beats after all , the fact that the company is shopping encourages some of us to anticipate what it could spend its hard - earned money on next			1
" among projects @entity33 envisions are beats being part of an @entity12 - created health - and - fitness monitor ( considered likely after @entity69 essentially punted the future of its @entity71 ) or providing the audio on a headset to compete with @entity74			1
' smart ' headphones for audiophiles , the marriage would , in some ways , be an ironic one			0
@entity12 , whose iconic earbuds have been knocked for delivering subpar sound , could be joined by @entity83 , which have received similar criticisms			0
" it is a fair assessment , and i lay the blame squarely on executive management , " said @entity85 , editor at audio website @entity86 , referring to beats			0
" their headphones had just way too much bass , as a general rule , and some models were particularly poor performers -- @entity98			0
build quality has gotten much better though ; they 're fairly well built headphones			0
" how @entity13 headphones changed the audio world @entity12 has worked to address quality issues with its earbuds , which had begun going straight into the garbage , or at least storage , at the hands of many new @entity109 and @entity110 customers			1
when their new - generation @entity113 rolled out in 2012 , @entity112 reviewer @entity111 may not have been damning them , but he certainly offered faint praise			0
" the @entity113 are possibly the best - sounding set of $ 29 earbuds you 'll be able to find , but at the end of the day , that 's not saying much , " he wrote			0
@entity85 sees some things changing and something staying the same at an @entity12 - owned beats			2
the well - established brand would remain intact to keep the " young and / or impressionable " buyers who are already fans			2
meanwhile , @entity12 could tap into @entity13 ' existing research and development and manufacturing knowhow to develop new products under the @entity12 name			1
he pointed to patents @entity12 has filed for things like biometric and spacial sensors in headsets , saying " smart headphones " from @entity12 could be on the way			1
" in other words , @entity12 has a bunch of cool new ideas about putting sensors in headphones , " @entity85 said			2
" beats gives them an instantaneous headphone development and manufacturing capability to kickstart the appearance of these new products			0
" @entity147 downloads but for all the talk about headphones -- beats ' flagship product and an accessory used with every @entity12 mobile device -- another potential product may have caught the eye of folks in @entity157			1
@entity158 launched in january , riding a wave of music - streaming websites and apps that have begun changing the way millions of people consume music			0
pay - by - the - song digital music services like @entity167 have been ceding market share to streaming services like @entity170 and @entity171 , which offer access to millions of songs , often for free			0
why everybody is building a @entity176 music service revenues for subscription streaming services were up 51 % in 2013 , according to the @entity179 ( @entity179 )			0
meanwhile digital downloads from services like @entity167 fell 2.1 % , the industry group said in its annual report			0
@entity12 's entry into the market , @entity186 , has failed to make much of a dent in the @entity188 , where @entity171 remains the dominant streaming service			1
the mobile - oriented beats music is just a few months old , but it 's gotten high marks for its robust suggestion engine that considers factors as detailed as which songs make the user crank up the volume			2
@entity197 , of @entity198 , said a major push into streaming could coincide with @entity12 also offering higher - quality , 24 - bit downloads			2
direct sales from @entity167 could become a more specialized market , wherein users would get the same sound quality they 're used to getting by streaming			0
" how many people will continue to pay for lossy ( low - quality ) downloads when they can stream millions of choices in the same quality for the cost of about one album download per month ? " @entity197 asked rhetorically			0
" this potential deal between @entity12 and @entity13 could very well spur @entity12 's move to hd downloads			1
if this deal happens , its safe to say we 'll see a sea change in the market and a move away from lossy downloads			0
i say it 's about damn time			0

@entity12 is reportedly close to buying headphone maker @entity13
the tech giant could *incorporate* beats research into " smart headphones "
analysts predict beats brand , popular with young buyers , wo n't go away
the deal would also boost @entity12 's music streaming potential
