@entity0 -- for more than two decades , @entity2 has been behind bars for the killing of a @entity6 rabbi during a botched diamond heist			1
in the years since his 1991 conviction , another man 's widow has identified her husband as the killer ; a onetime jail inmate has said he made up statements about @entity2 to boost his own fortunes ; and a now - grown boy who once picked him out of a lineup has come forward to say he was coached by a detective			1
now , @entity6 prosecutors have recommended that @entity2 go free -- and if a judge agrees , he could walk out of court as early as thursday			1
" there was never a doubt in my mind that he was innocent , " said @entity22 , the lawyer who represented @entity2 at his 1991 trial			1
the rabbi , @entity28 , died four days after being shot , a victim of the attempted holdup of a diamond courier			1
the courier escaped , but the would - be robber shot @entity28 through the window of his parked car , hauled him out of the vehicle and drove off , according to the @entity6 district attorney 's office			1
@entity39 , one of the detectives who investigated the case , told @entity1 that @entity2 admitted his involvement in the heist attempt and that he stands by the arrest			1
as for claims that police coached a witness , he said , " no way that happened			0
" but the now - retired @entity39 added , " if they release him tomorrow , i say , @entity49 bless him			0
i have nothing personal involved in this , and i was just doing my job			0
" @entity2 , now 58 , was arrested six months after @entity56 's february 1990 killing			1
he was picked up after two men facing trial on their own robbery charges gave his name to police , prosecutors recounted in asking that his second - degree murder conviction be tossed out and the charges dismissed			1
one of them , @entity66 , identified @entity2 as the gunman			1
another acquaintance -- a woman who had brought charges against @entity2 in a " prior altercation " -- told police that @entity2 had confided in her about the planned jewelry robbery and the murder of the rabbi , prosecutors wrote			1
in an initial lineup , only one witness recognized @entity78 , and that was after a lengthy conversation with a @entity82 interpreter , they noted			0
in the second lineup , three youths identified him and repeated that identification in court			0
one witness who did n't identify him was the courier , the intended target of the holdup			0
when questioned by detectives , @entity2 initially denied any involvement in the killing			1
then he acknowledged knowing @entity66 , according to prosecutors			2
then he admitted he had been near the scene and knowing his friends had planned a holdup			0
then he admitted he had been involved in planning the diamond heist , acted as the lookout and had seen @entity66 and the second jailed witness , @entity100 , with a gun			0
" two witnesses testified implicating him , " @entity22 told @entity1			0
" the police had an alleged confession from him , but there was no physical evidence			0
the jewelry courier , he testified for the defense , saying that @entity2 was n't the guy			1
a woman came forward saying @entity2 was innocent , that her husband was the one who did it , " said @entity22			1
despite that testimony for the defense , the jury found @entity2 guilty			1
he was sentenced to 37 Â½ years to life in prison			2
four years later , @entity118 came forward to say that her husband , @entity119 -- who died in a 1990 car accident -- had been the killer			2
he 'd been named as a possible suspect before , and @entity39 had brought the courier to the morgue in hopes that he would identify @entity118 's body as the gunman			2
@entity22 sought a new trial for his client based on @entity118 's testimony , but a judge refused to grant one			2
then in 2011 , he said , one of the kids who picked @entity2 out of a lineup got in touch with him			1
" i got a call saying , ' i 've lived with this for 20 years			2
the detective told me who to pick out , ' " @entity22 said			2
the call was from @entity140 , who later told investigators he identified @entity2 after being told by a detective to " pick the guy with the big nose			1
" " it was on his conscience for all these years , " @entity22 said			2
" he was 13 years old at the time			2
he was just a kid			0
he was just doing what they told him to do			0
" the @entity6 district attorney 's office had recently started a @entity151 to look into claims like @entity2 's			1
@entity22 told them about @entity140 's call , and the unit began to dig into @entity2 's case			1
but @entity100 admitted he had fabricated earlier statements he made about @entity158 , hoping that his cooperation would help his own criminal case			2
@entity100 's girlfriend at the time confessed that her account was manufactured to assist him			2
@entity118 reiterated her previous testimony			0
@entity39 said the case against @entity2 was " very simple			1
" " we had eyewitnesses who said they saw him shoot him , " he said			0
" we had statements that he made to other people , implicating himself , who have since died			0
we have the confession he gave to me			0
" and he sharply disputes @entity140 's account of being coached , telling @entity1 , " as far as i 'm concerned , it 's fiction			2
" " no way that happened , " he said , noting that dozens of prosecutors and police were watching the lineup			0
" they 're saying that i framed it , " @entity39 said			0
" i want to go on record saying this : i never framed anyone in my life , and you would have to be a low , low devil to do something like that			0
i slept very good for the last 22 years			1
" but eventually , @entity6 district attorney @entity191 recommended that the case be thrown out			1
@entity193 , a spokesman for @entity191 , told @entity1 that @entity2 will be brought back to @entity6 from a prison upstate on thursday			1
there , he 'll await the judge 's decision on his fate			0
@entity1 's calls to @entity199 , @entity2 's current lawyer , were not immediately returned			1
although @entity22 had been working with district attorney 's investigators for months , he was n't sure of what @entity191 had decided until he read about it			0
" i actually did n't know the end result			0
i prayed and prayed when i read it in the paper this morning			0
there were tears coming out of my eyes , " he said .			0
