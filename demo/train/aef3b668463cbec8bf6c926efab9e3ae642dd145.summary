@entity12 , from left , @entity13 and @entity14 were shot to death responding to a 911 call			1

" it was pure human error and a terrible thing that occurred , " @entity20 , chief of emergency services for @entity22 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity23			0
" in this particular case , our call - taker did not follow through with the appropriate training that she had received and [ make ] the appropriate notation that there were weapons in the house			0
" the bodies of the @entity7 police officers -- @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity12 -- are scheduled to lie in repose at @entity7 's city - county building wednesday before a public memorial is held thursday			1

@entity57 's mother , @entity56 , called 911 about 7 a.m. saturday to report that her son was " giving her a hard time , " according to a criminal complaint filed in the case			1

@entity57 told her son that she was calling police to remove him from the home , the complaint said			2
during that call , according to @entity23 , the dispatcher asked @entity57 , " does he have any weapons or anything ? " referring to her son			2

" @entity20 pointed out that the call was a " casual conversation " and that although " there 's no excuse for it whatsoever ... gathering from the casual nature of the call , the call - taker took an inference that [ the caller ] was not threatened and that guns or weapons were not involved			1

" authorities said the responding officers , @entity100 and @entity13 , were shot as they arrived at the home			1

@entity7 mayor @entity122 said in a statement that , although he has commended the county 911 center many times , saturday 's events " revealed a flaw in the 911 system			1
" " we now know that the 911 dispatcher was made aware that guns were present ... and that this information was not communicated to the officers , " @entity122 said , according to @entity23			1
" before responding to the call , the officers should have had the benefit of knowing that the actor owned firearms			0
we will never know if saturday 's events would have gone differently had the officers known			2
" @entity122 said he has asked the center 's management to develop a plan of action " to address flaws in the system and to ensure that this type of incident never happens again , " @entity23 reported .			0
