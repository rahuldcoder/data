-- monday night 's inaugural @entity0 / @entity1 revealed more about the current @entity3 presidential field than we 've seen in any previous debate			1
in the same way that the tea party has dramatically changed the course of national politics , this debate could change the course of the presidential race			1
@entity14 gov. @entity13 , who is strongly embraced by the tea party , revealed monday night what one might call a moderate or liberal side on a number of issues , opening the door to potential conservative criticism or perhaps an embrace from moderates			1
picking up where the last debate left off , the battle lines were drawn early over @entity27			2
@entity0 's @entity28 wasted no time in teeing up a @entity13 versus @entity30 showdown over @entity27 reform			1
@entity13 stood by his original @entity27 remarks , calling the program " a broken system			1
" he promised seniors that @entity27 would remain intact under his watch , but said it needed real reform			2
in response , @entity30 revealed a new aggressive and combative side that we 've rarely seen before			0
@entity30 sharply attacked @entity13 's use of the term " @entity44 , " saying it is over the top , unnecessary , and frightens people			1
in response , @entity13 calmly replied that rather than scaring seniors , it 's time to have a legitimate conversation in this country about how to fix @entity27			1
round one went to @entity13 , but it quickly changed after that			0
@entity56 , founder of the @entity57 , was a crowd favorite all night			1
she moved to the right of @entity30 and @entity13 all night and made it a key point to emphasize personal responsibility over government oversight , winning loud applause from the crowd			1
while she refused to attack @entity13 's comments about the @entity67 , she pulled no punches when it came to his decision requiring girls to get vaccinated for the hpv virus -- saying it was " just flat out wrong " and " a violation of a liberty interest " -- and accused @entity13 of catering to big pharmaceutical interests			2
sen. @entity77 piggybacked off @entity56 's comments and dealt some of the toughest shots against @entity13 all night			1
@entity77 , a longtime champion of individual liberty , said @entity13 's decision was " big government run amok , " receiving loud applause			0
it was one of @entity13 's weaker moments , especially with the @entity87 crowd			1
another tea party favorite , former speaker of the house @entity90 , did well with the crowd			0
@entity93 continued his narrative against the mainstream liberal media and shunned any attempt to criticize his fellow @entity3 , while playing smartly to the @entity87 's vision of shrinking government to match revenue , not raising taxes to catch up with government spending , as he said			2
the most revealing moments of the debate occurred as the dialogue shifted from economic issues to immigration and foreign policy			0
@entity13 found himself in the hot seat after staunchly supporting a @entity14 law that grants in - state tuition to the children of undocumented immigrants , saying that immigration is a states ' rights issue			2
he also criticized a border fence as unrealistic , saying , " the idea that you 're going to build a wall from @entity120 to @entity121 and go left for another 800 miles to @entity122 is just not reality			0
" @entity124 railed against @entity13 , saying , " for @entity13 to say that you ca n't secure the border i think is pretty much a treasonous comment			0
" @entity56 joined in and compared @entity13 's position on in - state tuition to the @entity131 , supported by president @entity132			1
and for the final blow , @entity30 said that @entity13 's immigration plan would only promote and encourage an influx of illegal aliens			2
the topic of foreign policy was left for second - to - last and given only a few minutes of consideration , but the responses were noteworthy , and somewhat discouraging			0
@entity13 found himself awkwardly agreeing with @entity124 's call to bring home the troops in @entity144 , while failing to put forward his own substantive plan on the @entity144 war			0
many on the right will be disappointed in what they heard monday night , a day after the tenth anniversary of the september 11 attacks			0
in the end , tea party favorites like @entity56 , @entity93 , @entity77 and @entity153 were the winners , though polls may not move much			2
@entity13 was on the defensive all night and , despite his reputation nationally , he came across as " liberal " on some issues , criticized from the right on the vaccination issue , immigration , and @entity144			1
but some in the center might have warmed to @entity13 and some of his non-tea party stances			0
it remains to be seen whether his standing with conservatives will weaken -- at this point i doubt that it will			0
and once again , @entity30 was able to escape unharmed from a not - so - friendly crowd by shifting his attacks toward @entity13 and tacking away from some of his more center - right positions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity177 : @entity0 / @entity1 may change course of presidential race
he says @entity13 adopted a moderate or even liberal stance on some issues
other *candidates* attacked @entity13 on immigration , hpv vaccine , @entity27
