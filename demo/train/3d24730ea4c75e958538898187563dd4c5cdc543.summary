-- @entity1 flaunted a new generation of centrifuges and mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle wednesday as president @entity6 , clad in a white lab coat , was on hand to load domestically made fuel rods into the core of a @entity12 reactor			1
also announced was an intent to start production of yellowcake , a chemically treated form of uranium ore used for making enriched uranium			1
@entity20 sanctions ban @entity1 from importing yellowcake			1
domestic production would further @entity1 's nuclear self - sufficiency			1
in a speech outlining the latest developments , @entity6 said @entity1 was willing to share its nuclear knowledge with other nations that subscribe to the watchdog @entity27 ( @entity27 )			1
the @entity28 , however , dismissed @entity1 's announcements as bluster for a domestic audience			1
" we frankly do n't see a lot new here			0
this is not big news , " said spokeswoman @entity34			0
" in fact , it seems to have been hyped			0
the @entity1 for many months have been putting out calendars of accomplishments and based on their own calendars they are many , many months behind			2
state - run @entity43 broadcast live images of the @entity12 event , hailed by the @entity1 as a major scientific advancement for the @entity47 republic			1
the first @entity1 nuclear fuel rods , produced by @entity1 scientists at the @entity51 facility in central @entity1 , are to be used at the @entity52 , which @entity1 says is used primarily for medical purposes			2
the @entity12 facility creates radio isotopes used for cancer treatment , @entity43 reported , adding that 850,000 cancer patients were in dire need			0
@entity6 had announced in a speech marking the 33rd anniversary of the @entity1 revolution last week that @entity1 would be unveiling something big			1
wednesday , he lashed out once again at @entity64 powers who , he said , attempt to monopolize nuclear technology and prevent other nations from acquiring a key energy source			0
@entity6 , surrounded by photos of assassinated @entity1 nuclear scientists , said @entity1 has shown up the @entity71			1
@entity12 's latest activities have spiked tensions with @entity64 powers , which believe @entity1 's atomic ambitions are focused on building a bomb			1
" i am not so worried about the fuel issue but i am worried about the advanced centrifuges , " said @entity77 , chief energy adviser with the nuclear consulting group @entity79			1
" if they are better , ( @entity1 ) can make enriched uranium faster , " he said			2
nuclear power plants use uranium that is enriched to 5 % , @entity77 said			0
making a nuclear bomb requires uranium to be enriched 20 % or more , he said			0
that means the centrifuge must spin at 50,000 revolutions per minute for a longer amount of time			0
a more sophisticated centrifuge would make the process easier , @entity77 said			0
" to be able to make any centrifuge , let alone a high - speed centrifuge , is technologically a very substantial step , " he said			0
a november @entity27 report found " credible " information that @entity12 has carried out work toward nuclear weapons -- including tests of possible bomb components			0
subsequent punitive measures against @entity1 have disrupted its economy			2
in response to the latest @entity106 sanctions on the energy and banking sectors , @entity1 is cutting oil exports to six @entity111 countries : the @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , @entity43 reported wednesday			2
despite @entity1 's drift away from the international community , @entity12 's leaders have refused to bow down , insisting its nuclear program is intended for civilian energy purposes			1
in january 2008 , the semi-official @entity124 news agency reported that @entity1 was able to produce everything it needs for the nuclear fuel cycle , making its nuclear program self - sufficient			2
but it was not clear that @entity12 actually had the technology to turn enriched uranium into fuel rods			0
then , last month , @entity1 said it had succeeded in building and testing a nuclear fuel rod , or a stack of low - enriched uranium pellets bundled together at the core of a nuclear reactor			0
the @entity27 's governing council has adopted a resolution expressing " deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the @entity1 nuclear program			2
" @entity1 called the november @entity27 report a fabrication aimed at bolstering @entity146 accusations that @entity1 is working toward making a bomb			0
" we will never ever suspend our enrichment , " @entity148 , @entity1 's permanent envoy to the @entity27 , said in november .			1

new : the @entity28 dismisses @entity1 's announcements as bluster
@entity1 says it has developed advanced centrifuges and will start yellowcake production
@entity6 says @entity1 is willing to share its knowledge with other nations
the developments are hailed as major achievements
