there have now been nearly 9,000 confirmed , probable and suspected cases of ebola virus disease across seven affected countries			2
at least 4,400 people have died so far in this , the worst outbreak of @entity3 since it emerged in 1976			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) is warning that weekly cases could reach 10,000 by the start of december -- it is clear that the peak of this epidemic has n't yet been reached			1
understandably , countries around the world -- particularly those affected ( @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 ) -- have been examining their defenses against importing cases			2
these have become ever more emergent since @entity27 -- who contracted @entity3 -- traveled to @entity28 from @entity29 , leading to the subsequent secondary transmission of the infection of two people who treated him , @entity35 and @entity34			1
public concerns about the infection have n't been allayed by public health officials , despite many of us stressing that we are well - prepared for detecting and responding to imported cases			1
our preparations in @entity43 hark back to 2003 when the world was faced with its first modern - day pandemic , in the form of @entity47 , or @entity47 , caused by the sars - coronavirus			1
this virus first appeared in november 2002 , with the first @entity8 outbreak alert being made in march 2003			1
at the time @entity47 caused a huge amount of public and professional anxiety , principally due to its apparent ease of transmission ( via respiratory droplets and fomites ) and its very early global spread from @entity58 to @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
however , looking back this was a far less severe infection than @entity3 , with estimates of 10,000 cases in total and around 1,000 deaths			1
however , two significant aspects make us remember and learn from @entity47			1
one is the fact that 30 countries had cases within a few weeks of the outbreak , and the second is the estimated $ 30 - $ 100 billion cost to the world economy			1
most of these economic costs were in travel and tourism with public anxiety about the disease leading to airports becoming ghost towns , schools closing , shopping malls deserted and healthcare workers shunned			0
emerging infections were no longer viewed as a healthcare problem but as a whole - of - government problem with strong coordination required between transportation , immigration , communications , finance , water and sanitation , defense , housing , and education			2
the decision - making processes in response to an epidemic are complex and highly challenging , and require a clear chain of command with timely , accurate , appropriate and feasible plans put forward			2
global action in recognition of the interconnected world that we live in and the need to expand the scope of notifiable diseases , the @entity106 ( @entity107 ) -- a legally - binding agreement that provides a framework for the coordination of the management of global public health events -- underwent a revision in 2005			2
here the notion of " public health emergencies of international concern " was introduced , as was the need for countries to establish a minimum core of public health capacities			0
in response to the @entity107 and the clear need for multi-agency and ministry planning to be in place , most countries developed pandemic plans			2
in order for these to cater for worst - case scenarios ( i.e. transmissible infections with high attack rates ) , influenza became the focus -- the influenza pandemic plans for @entity43 can be found here			1
many of these are modeled on the generic @entity8 plan but tailored for specific countries			0
these plans were implemented during the 2009 a ( @entity148 ) influenza , or " swine flu " pandemic			0
some countries in @entity43 also used them during recent outbreaks of @entity153 ( @entity154 ) and a ( @entity155 ) " avian flu			0
" but influenza is much more transmissible than the ebola virus , so the recent focus by many countries ' public health ministries has been to adjust their plans along the lines of current @entity8 guidelines			0
lessons have also been learned regarding what does n't work			0
the screening of incoming passengers into airports was practiced widely during the 2009 influenza pandemic			0
however many countries note that they did not detect a single case through the use of these measures			0
thermal scanners at airports to detect fever have been shown to be of limited use			0
the @entity8 has continued to stress these facts , but political considerations have led some countries , notably the @entity23 and @entity183 , to implement incoming passenger screening anyway			0
travel restrictions finally the question of travel restrictions has been raised by a number of commentators			0
these were used to good effect during @entity47 but were of limited use during the 2009 influenza pandemic			1
it is widely acknowledged that the damage caused by travel restrictions to the economies of the @entity29 countries would compound the very significant economic costs already experienced			2
travel restrictions would only make it more difficult for the international community to provide the healthcare workers and supplies needed to get the outbreak under control			0
while thinking about our own infection control processes and planning for imported cases , we need to remember that the sure - fire way to prevent domestic @entity3 cases is by pitching into the global effort in @entity29			1
while the outbreak continues to grow exponentially , the risk of spillover into other countries increases			0
while ensuring that we have domestic plans in place is good , all of us need to recognize our role as good global citizens and give aid and help to those countries worst affected .			1

who is warning that weekly cases could reach 10,000 by the start of december
2003 @entity47 outbreak was the worst global pandemic of the modern era
@entity47 , however , was a far less severe infection than @entity3 , say @entity231 - @entity230
best way to prevent domestic @entity3 cases is by pitching in to the global effort in @entity29
