the baby @entity0 gave birth to while she was held captive in a @entity3 home was delivered by another one of the young women in the house , according to a police source familiar with the investigation			1
the information was corroborated in a police report seen by @entity10			2
when @entity11 went into labor , @entity0 , now charged with kidnapping and rape , grabbed captive @entity0 and told her to deliver the baby			1
the baby was born into a plastic tub or pool to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid			1
when the baby was born , it stopped breathing and everyone started screaming , the source said , citing the girl 's account			1
@entity0 allegedly said , " if that baby dies , i 'm going to kill you			1
" " what 's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6 - year - old , " the source said			1
the three women spent their days and nights captive at 2207 @entity35 , a 1,400 - square - foot home in one of @entity3 's oldest neighborhoods			2
they went outside only twice in that span -- just " briefly " at that -- @entity3 public safety director @entity40 said			0
more often , the three would be in different rooms , though they interacted occasionally and came to " rely on each other for survival , " said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation			2
one thing they could count on was that their alleged captor would never let them out			0
@entity0 would often test @entity11 , @entity0 and @entity0 , the young women he 'd allegedly abducted , by pretending to leave , said the law enforcement source			1
he 'd return suddenly : if there were indications any of the women had moved , they 'd be disciplined			2
in that time , the women saw their parents on television at vigils held for them , according to the law enforcement source			1
they got emotional , knowing their loved ones were looking for them			0
and in time , @entity0 and @entity0 " succumbed " to " their reality , " the law enforcement source said			1
but " something must have clicked " for @entity11 on monday evening , said @entity3 's deputy police chief @entity66			1
she staged a daring escape , and with the help of @entity0 's neighbors @entity0 and @entity70 , freed herself , her 6 - year - old daughter , @entity0 and @entity0			1
neighbor who helped @entity11 an instant internet star on wednesday night , @entity0 , the man who allegedly held them against their will for so many years , was behind bars			1
he 'll be arraigned thursday morning on four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape tied to the case , said @entity85 , chief assistant prosecutor for the city of @entity3			0
the women found in his home , meanwhile , are back with family -- the same relatives who cried and struggled but , for the most part , never gave up hope			0
" i knew my daughter was out there alive , " said @entity93 , @entity94 's father , moments after she arrived wednesday afternoon at a family home in @entity3			0
" i knew she needed me , and i never gave up			0
" survival the key difference from ' @entity101 ' case lured into a vehicle , then trapped in a home @entity0 was 21 on august 22 , 2002 , when @entity0 lured her into his vehicle along @entity3 's @entity105 , according to charging documents			1
@entity0 took her back to his home on @entity35 , about three miles away , and did n't let her go			1
in that time , @entity0 was sexually assaulted repeatedly , the documents state			1
but soon , she was n't alone			0
the next year -- on april 21 , 2003 , the eve of her 17th birthday -- @entity11 experienced the same nightmare scenario			1
while walking home from her job at @entity115 that night , she too took a ride from @entity0 on @entity105			2
almost exactly a year later , they were joined by @entity0 , then all of 14 years old			2
who are @entity11 , @entity0 and @entity0 they remained in that hell until monday evening , when @entity11 screamed for help			1
hearing her cries , @entity0 and @entity70 kicked in a door to help her escape			1
according to @entity70 , @entity11 's 6 - year - old daughter ran out of the house too , wearing only a diaper and a sullied shirt			2
police are conducting a dna test to determine the child 's paternity			0
" help me , i am @entity0 , " @entity11 begged a 911 operator from @entity0 's house			1
" i 've been kidnapped , and i 've been missing for 10 years			0
and i 'm here , i 'm free now			0
" @entity3 police chief @entity137 told @entity144 's " today " show that the women were bound and that there were " chains and ropes in the home			2
" there were no apparent constraints monday , the law enforcement source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation said			0
yet @entity0 and @entity0 did n't run out of the house with @entity11 although they could have , the source said , describing them as brainwashed and fearful			1
' @entity0 kept everybody at a distance ' so how did this all happen in an urban neighborhood ? did @entity0 , a former school bus driver and upbeat and " outgoing " musician , according to one bandmate , keep such a secret from not only his neighbors but his family , as police allege ? timeline : from missing to liberated soon after the three women were found , @entity0 and two of his brothers who were with him were taken into custody			1
over the next two days , authorities officials " found no facts to link " @entity170 and @entity171 to the kidnappings -- though both brothers will appear in @entity174 on thursday related to outstanding warrants on misdemeanor cases on other matters			0
" @entity0 kept everybody at a distance , " @entity66 said of the suspect , explaining why even his brothers and other family members ( @entity0 talked on @entity182 about having five grandchildren ) apparently were in the dark			1
@entity0 has been talking to investigators since tuesday , as have the three young women police say he kidnapped and raped			1
after those conversations , @entity66 said he does n't believe there are other victims -- including @entity192 , who was 14 when she went missing in the same part of @entity3 in 2007 -- or anyone other than @entity0 involved			1
and since monday , law enforcement personnel have combed through @entity0 's @entity35 home -- which @entity66 said was in " disarray " when officers first went in -- and removed more than 200 items that they hope will let them piece together what happened			2
additionally , @entity203 agents searched a boarded - up home two doors down after obtaining information over the past few days tying that building to the case , the deputy police chief explained			0
second - guessing if more could have been done as they investigate , authorities are facing second - guessing as to whether any of this could have been prevented			0
some comes from neighbors who say they contacted police about suspicious activity on @entity0 's property such as reports of screaming and naked women in his backyard			1
authorities say they never got any such calls			0
in fact , police say they had only been to @entity0 's house twice , once after he called about a fight on his street and in 2004 to investigate an incident in which he was accused of leaving a child alone on a bus			1
no one answered at the home , and investigators later interviewed him elsewhere , police said			0
police deny neighbors called about suspicious activity and according to court documents from 2005 , @entity0 's former common - law wife accused him of repeatedly abusing her , including breaking her nose twice , breaking two ribs , dislocating her shoulder twice and knocking out a tooth			1
a judge granted a protection order but lifted it three months later			0
@entity66 , for one , said he does n't think authorities dropped the ball			0
" i 'm just very , very confident ( that ) law enforcement officers ... checked every single lead , and if there was one bit of evidence ( they would have ) followed it up very , very aggressively , " he said			0
" in hindsight , we may find out that maybe we did , but that 's going to be in hindsight			0
" neighbors feel ' fooled ' by @entity3 abduction suspect relief , joy as victims reunite with family for the first time in years , relatives of @entity11 , @entity0 and @entity0 -- whom @entity85 described wednesday as " safe and healthy " -- do n't have only memories to fall back on			1
they can look forward , and move on with their lives			0
@entity263 told " today " that , as of wednesday , she still had n't talked with her daughter @entity264			0
@entity0 , now 32 , was then in a @entity3 hospital in a good condition			2
" she 's probably angry at the world , because she thought she would never be found , " @entity263 said			0
" but thank @entity268 that somebody did			0
" asked what she would tell her daughter , her mother said , " i love you and i missed you all this time			0
" well - wishers welcomed @entity11 and her daughter on wednesday to a family home in @entity3 that was decorated with balloons and stuffed animals			2

a similar scene played out at a @entity0 family home , where relatives embraced their long - lost relative			2
@entity285 said that her niece , @entity0 , is " ecstatic " to be back with her relatives			2
when the now 23 - year - old arrived at the house , " she was happy , she looked at the house and she wanted a tour			0
" " what more can she say -- her face , her expression , her smile , ( her ) hugging says it all			0
