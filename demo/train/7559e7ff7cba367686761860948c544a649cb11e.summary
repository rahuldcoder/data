he was surprised to hear the voice on the other end of the line			0

for months , church officials had made sharp , public criticisms of the push to legalize same - sex marriage in the @entity22 country			1
but privately , @entity12 seemed to be more open to discussion , according to @entity0			0
5 things to know about @entity12 " he told me			2
... ' i 'm in favor of gay rights and in any case , i also favor civil unions for homosexuals , but i believe that @entity6 is not yet ready for a gay marriage law , ' " said @entity0 , a gay rights activist , a self - described devout @entity3 and a former theology professor at a @entity3 seminary			1
the pope 's reported willingness behind - the - scenes to accept civil unions as a compromise may offer new insight into how he will lead the world 's 1.2 billion @entity3			1
a public battle as archbishop of @entity13 , @entity12 was one of the leaders of the @entity3 's public charge against legalizing same - sex marriage in @entity6			1
he engaged in a notorious war of words with the government of president @entity51 , who supported the measure			2
@entity12 put himself in the middle of the fight , calling the proposed legislation " a destructive attack on @entity58 's plan			1
" with a front - page counterpunch , the president said the church possessed " attitudes reminiscent of medieval times and the @entity63			2
" some point to the public battle as evidence of @entity12 's traditionalist views			0
but behind closed doors , @entity0 said , the man who would become pope appeared to be more open to discussion of the issue			0

@entity12 was ' very open , very frank ' @entity12 , who chose the name @entity12 after he was elected pontiff last week , may have voiced his support for civil unions in other circles			1
@entity86 , a former pastor of the @entity87 in @entity13 , said @entity12 made similar comments about civil unions to him in a private meeting			1
" in this conversation that we had , he showed himself to be very open , very frank with me , " @entity86 told @entity91 on wednesday			0
" he told me that he would have accepted a civil union			2
" according to a story published by @entity96 on wednesday , @entity12 also told bishops at a 2010 meeting that the church should support civil unions for gay couples			1
@entity91 could not independently confirm the details of the @entity6 bishops ' meeting , which was also described in a july 2010 article published by @entity6 's @entity107 newspaper			1
" @entity12 -- faithful to his moderate position -- proposed continuing measured actions			0
... he would suggest , also , that the church discreetly accept the intermediate alternative of the civil union -- authorizing a series of rights ( inheritance , social work ) -- that would not equate to marriage nor permit adoption , " wrote journalist @entity111 -- now @entity12 's biographer			2
but that proposal was rejected by bishops , who voted instead to begin a high - profile , public battle against same - sex marriage , @entity111 wrote			1
pushing for dialogue a senior @entity129 official said he could neither confirm nor deny the @entity96 report at this point , adding that while @entity12 might have expressed such a view while he was a cardinal , he should be given time to develop his policy position as pontiff			0
@entity136 , the rector of the @entity137 in @entity13 , said it was unlikely the pope had ever expressed such a view , even in private			1

gay rights advocates in @entity6 later argued that civil unions , allowed in a several states , were a positive step that conferred some benefits to same - sex couples , but did n't go far enough			1
the same - sex marriage measure , they said , would treat homosexual and heterosexual relationships equally before the law			1
it would permit gay couples to adopt , and also allow the inheritance of property			0
@entity6 approved a law legalizing same - sex marriage nationwide in july 2010			1
even though @entity12 was one of the law 's most well known opponents , @entity0 said on wednesday that he hopes the pontiff will remain open to discussion , just as he appeared to be several years ago in @entity13			2
" we are going to try to have a dialogue with the pope , " said @entity0 , who works for @entity6 's @entity166			1
" it 's frightening , but i think it must be done			0
" ' he 's really moderate on this issue ' word of the pope 's reported support for civil unions in @entity6 sparked debate , with some praising his stance and saying it was a hopeful sign of possible reforms			1
" he wanted to respect human rights			0
that 's the real surprise here , that people say , well he 's anti-gay			0

" he 's really moderate on this issue , it seems			0
" others , though , were more skeptical			0

in an article titled , " @entity12 , the pope that declares war on us and later calls us on the phone , " journalist @entity198 said it was n't clear how the pope will handle the issue of same - sex unions			1
" maybe the lion has become a lamb			0
maybe , as a priest told me the day his election was announced , maybe he is worried about his biography and wants to go down in history			0
