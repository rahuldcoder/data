-- many @entity1 might feel reassured when @entity2 , the director of the @entity3 , says the battle against @entity5 in the @entity1 is being waged effectively			1
his bedside manner is impeccable and his calm confident demeanor inspiring			0
yet many might also wonder how the ebola virus entered the @entity1 and appeared in @entity9 under his watch in the first place			0
so where is the reassuring guy with the beard and the fancy naval uniform festooned with medals , who warned us for so long about the dangers of smoking ? the colorful and trustworthy former surgeon general of the @entity1 , dr. @entity22 ? at a time when many @entity1 are afraid of the possible spread of a deadly virus , we do not have a full - fledged surgeon general -- often called the " @entity28 " -- and have not had one since @entity30 resigned in 2013			1
we do n't notice government officials are missing until a crisis emerges			0
now , when @entity1 perceive what 's happening with @entity5 as a national health crisis , the seat of the " @entity36 " remains empty			1
yes , we have an acting surgeon general , rear adm. @entity38 , but the president has expressed no interest in appointing him to the permanent spot , and without the support of the president , the post does n't have much power			1
although sen. @entity47 is urging the appointment of an " ebola czar , " it should be the surgeon general in full battle attire , the " @entity28 , " who is stepping up			1
who 's to blame for this vacancy at a time when @entity5 is causing two - thirds of @entity1 to fear a widespread epidemic ? complete coverage on @entity5 the @entity59 blame the president for nominating dr. @entity61 , a 36 - year - old physician and entrepreneur			1
@entity59 say he 's too young , and his prime qualification for the nation 's most prestigious medical post appears to be that he was once co-chairman of " doctors for @entity67			2
" @entity68 counter that @entity59 opposition has nothing to do with the highly trained doctor 's tender age , but is based on his support of the @entity74 and his opinion that gun violence is a public health issue			2
putting the gun issue aside , 36 does seem a little young to take on such an important post			0
many medical doctors are just finishing advanced training in their mid- 30s			0
searching for a prestigious hospital affiliation and joining a good medical practice are their primary concerns , not the formation of national health policy			0
while @entity61 has impressive academic credentials , surely a little more seasoning is required to be a surgeon general			2
undoubtedly the president 's advisers could easily locate an experienced , articulate and relatively nonpolitical doctor who would be proud to assume the post			2
we do n't pick our doctors for their politics , we pick them for their experience and their competence			0
the surgeon general should be selected in the same spirit -- and one would hope that the president and @entity103 would have figured this out			1
at some point , the surgeon general must stand at the podium and inspire the confidence of the @entity1 people			1
the post has been around for a long time , dating back in slightly different forms to the presidency of @entity113 , who managed to appoint a competent physician while putting the country back together in the aftermath of the @entity117			0
surely our political leaders can muster the will to put a seasoned surgeon general at the helm as soon as possible			2
nothing is more reassuring to a sick and troubled patient than the calm and steady voice of a physician offering sound advice and proper medical treatment .			0

@entity129 : @entity131 head is playing ' @entity28 ' in reassuring @entity1 about @entity5
@entity129 : @entity5 is scaring @entity1 , and we need a surgeon general to take charge
but the @entity59 thinks president 's nominee is too political and , at 36 , too young
@entity129 : we need @entity103 and president to appoint a permanent surgeon general
