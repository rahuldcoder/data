@entity0 -- a new study by three universities shows that people holding positions of power with low status tend to demean others , one of the authors said			1
the research sheds light on why clerks can seem rude or even why the @entity16 guards humiliated and tortured their prisoners , the researcher said			1
in an article to be published in the @entity20 , researchers studied the relationship between the status and the power of a job , said @entity25 , assistant professor of management and organization at the @entity29 's @entity28			1
the study , " @entity31 , " determined that the combination of some authority and little perceived status can be toxic			1
" we found that people who had high power and high status , they were pretty cool , " @entity25 told @entity1			1
" but it was people who had power and lacked status who used their power to require other persons to engage in demeaning behavior			1
" in a field of study where psychologists and business schools are now jointly looking at how power shapes business relationships , the study 's authors examined the notions of how low status is " threatening and aversive " and how power " frees people to act on their internal states and feelings , " the researchers say			1
" the world was shocked when pictures circulated in 2004 showing low - ranking @entity66 soldiers physically and sexually abusing prisoners from the @entity68 in @entity69 , " the study says			2
" one could point to these examples as support for the popular idea that ' power corrupts			2
' " however , we believe there is more to the story			0
although it is true that the prison guards had power , it is equally true that their roles provided little to no respect and admiration in the eyes of others			2
they had power but they lacked status			2
we posit that understanding the combinations of these two variables â € ” power and status â € ” produces key insights into the causes of destructive and demeaning behavior , " the study says			1
the researchers held experiments with students who were randomly assigned a high - status " idea producer " role or low - status " worker " role			2
the students were asked to select from a list of 10 activities for the others to perform			0
five of the most demeaning commands were : say " i 'm filthy " five times , say " i am not worthy " five times , bark like a dog three times , state three negative personal traits and count backward from 500 in increments of seven			0
the least five demeaning activities were : write a short essay on your experiences today , say a funny joke , clap hands 50 times , do five pushups , and jump up and down 10 times on one leg , the study said			0
the research found that " individuals in high - power / low - status roles chose more demeaning activities for their partners ( e.g. , bark like a dog , say " i am filthy " ) than did those in any other combination of power and status roles			1
" " our findings indicate that the experience of having power without status , whether as a member of the military or a college student participating in an experiment , may be a catalyst for producing demeaning behaviors that can destroy relationships and impede goodwill , " the study said			1
remedies to such situations include upper management telling persons in high - power / low - status posts " how important these roles are , so that they have status , " @entity25 said			2
the promise of bonuses or promotions could also help , @entity25 said			0
but not all people in such posts are so disagreeable , he added			0
" there are a lot of people in these roles who treat others well , and that 's probably a function of personality , " @entity25 added			0
" i do n't want everyone in these roles to say , ' wait a minute , i do n't act that way			0
' there are other moderators like personality and culture			0
" the study was also conducted by @entity184 , acting assistant professor of organizational behavior at the @entity187 , and @entity188 , professor of management and organizations at the @entity191 at @entity192			0
" it 's important to study power and status because hierarchy is everywhere			1
you ca n't get away from it , " @entity25 said			0
" whether you 're with family and friends , volunteering at a soup kitchen , or working in a big organization , there 's always a hierarchy			0
