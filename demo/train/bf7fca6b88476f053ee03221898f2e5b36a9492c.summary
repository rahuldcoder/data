@entity0 -- when it comes to 2016 , @entity2 is in no rush to decide about another run for the @entity6			1
this amid mounting speculation that @entity8 will launch another bid , and with everything she says , and every move she makes , scrutinized for signals of where she stands when it comes to her political future			1
" i 'm not in any hurry			2
i think it 's a serious decision , not to be made lightly , but it 's also not one that has to be made soon , " @entity8 told @entity20 in her first interview since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of this year			1
far from her denials in interviews at the beginning of the year , when she told @entity1 that she had " absolutely no plans to run , " @entity8 now appears to be wrestling with a decision , saying in the @entity20 interview that " i will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision			1
" @entity2 on 2016 run : ' i 'm realistic ' even as @entity8 2016 story count keeps rising many @entity40 both inside and outside @entity41 agree that , because of who she is , she does n't need to be the first one out of the gate to announce her 2016 intentions			1
" there is definitely no rush for @entity2 to decide about 2016 , " said @entity40 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity47			1
" as someone who wants her to run , i still understand that she has lots of time			0
no one should try to rush @entity2 on this			2
she has earned the right to advance her mission in the foundation			0
@entity2 has earned the unique status she has today , and there is no need for her to be pressured into diving back into the political swamp			2
" thanks to her name recognition , the former first lady , senator from @entity69 and secretary of state is the overwhelming frontrunner in early 2016 surveys			1
in the most recent survey , conducted earlier this month by @entity1 / @entity74 , nearly two - thirds of @entity40 and independents who lean toward that party said they were likely to back @entity8 as their presidential nominee			2
vice president @entity79 came in a distant second , at 10 % , with freshman sen. @entity81 of @entity82 at 7 % , @entity69 gov. @entity83 at 6 % , and @entity85 gov. @entity84 at 2 %			0
the @entity1 survey was in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated @entity8 was far ahead of all the other possible @entity40 contenders			1
@entity47 , who was a senior political adviser to president @entity8 , said @entity2 's " time horizon and the whole rest of the party 's time horizon are very , very different , " adding that " anybody else has got to start to lay the groundwork " much earlier than @entity8			1
" " @entity2 has more time than anyone else			2
and that 's why her friends , and i 'm one of them , are saying she can take her time			0
she does n't need to build name identification			0
she does n't even need to build a roster of donors			0
" translation : do n't expect to see @entity8 make a stop in @entity108 , @entity109 , or @entity110 anytime soon , as some of the other potential 2016ers , such as @entity84 and even @entity79 , have already made			1
@entity8 already has a @entity113 named " @entity114 " actively raising money in support of a possible 2016 bid			1
and the political action committee that @entity119 advises , " @entity118 , " which was formed in 2011 to back president @entity122 's 2012 re-election campaign and spent millions on tv ads critical of @entity124 , could play a similar role for @entity8 should she run again			1
asked if there is a concern that if @entity8 waits too long , some big name donors and influential @entity40 politicians could stray to other 2016 candidates , @entity47 said such a scenario is " not a concern at all			1
" not all democrats agree			0
" she is the prohibitive favorite , but the dynamics of the race change the longer someone waits			0
so the question is how long can she wait , " said @entity139 , a @entity40 strategist and a veteran of the @entity141 2004 and @entity142 2008 presidential campaigns			0
" if she gets in early , she sucks up the oxygen , the money , and the grassroots			0
she could basically kill the field			0
" @entity151 : @entity2 ill - suited to be president when it comes to polling , @entity8 's standing now compares to her situation the first time she ran for president , when she was the @entity40 favorite in the early years of the 2008 presidential cycle			1
she was the front - runner in @entity1 polling from mid- 2005 through 2006 , prior to her january 2007 announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee , which formally kicked off her presidential fundraising and campaigning			0
by then , sens. @entity122 of @entity167 and @entity168 of @entity169 , @entity79 , former sen. @entity142 of @entity170 , and gov. @entity171 of @entity172 had all jumped in			0
@entity173 : @entity2 more ready for @entity6 than husband , @entity122 were @entity8 and @entity122 eventually went on to battle each other in a historic primary season , which ended with @entity8 ending her bid for the nomination in june 2008 , at the conclusion of the primary calendar			1
@entity182 , a veteran of three presidential campaigns , suggests there may be a middle ground for @entity8			2
" @entity2 faces a paradoxical choice : if she announces that she 's re-entering the political fray , scrutiny on her would be heightened exponentially			2
yet even without an announcement , the press and her potential opponents are already treating her like she is running , " said @entity182 , who served as a deputy press secretary for @entity122 's 2008 campaign and national press secretary for the 2012 re-election campaign			0
" the solution might be to ensure trusted advisers are working from the outside to manage rapid response , cultivate donors and study her prospective competitors ' records to lay the groundwork for a run for as long as possible without jumping two feet in			0
" @entity8 herself downplays any imminent announcement , saying such speculation is n't good for the country			1
" it 's like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there , " @entity8 said			2
" and you want to talk to them about something that 's really important ; in fact , maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person , and they just want to know what 's next			0
i feel like that 's our political process right now			0
i just do n't think it is good			2

@entity2 tells an interviewer that she 's wrestling with a 2016 decision
*analysts* say that because of name recognition and stature , she should be in no hurry
*public* opinion polls show @entity8 as the overwhelming favorite among democrats
@entity8 herself says such speculation over 2016 is n't good for the country
