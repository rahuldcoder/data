-- defending champions @entity2 trail arch rivals @entity1 by a massive 18 points in the @entity4 , so for the rest of the season their mission is to hunt down success in the cup competitions			0
such a gap to their @entity12 cousins has heaped the pressure on @entity2 coach @entity15 , who must now focus on @entity17 's premier cup competition , the @entity18 , and the @entity19 for salvation			1
all might be forgiven if he was to secure @entity23 's most prestigious club prize for a third time as coach , after previous triumphs with @entity28 side @entity27 and @entity30 giants @entity29			0
at the very least @entity2 's fans will expect him to win the @entity17 's second biggest domestic trophy , and a 2 - 0 win in the first leg of their @entity18 tie was enough to quieten the protests against him			1
a strike from @entity40 and an @entity42 own goal sealed victory on a chilly night in @entity2 but @entity2 rode their luck on several occasions in front of their vociferous home support			1
@entity48 , as ever , was at the center of most of @entity2 's attacking thrusts in the early stages , the @entity28 striker firing a free kick narrowly wide of the post in the opening stages			0
@entity55 , signed last year from @entity57 club @entity56 , then spurned a glorious chance to put @entity2 ahead before @entity61 's @entity60 striker @entity59 twice went close in a matter of minutes			2
his misses were to prove costly as @entity40 then slotted home from @entity67 international @entity66 's pass inside the area on 37 minutes			0
@entity2 's fans began to get restless around the hour mark as @entity61 began to dominate before @entity59 shot wide of an open goal from 12 yards after @entity2 goalkeeper @entity72 had parried @entity74 's effort into his path			2
again , within minutes of a @entity59 miss @entity2 scored , this time @entity61 defender @entity42 putting through his own net from a @entity78 cross			1
@entity48 was then denied his 29th goal of the season by two brilliant saves from @entity61 goalkeeper @entity82 , who first repelled the striker 's point blank shot from ten yards out before flicking a powerful strike round the post less than a minute later			2
a 2 - 0 win gives @entity2 a comfortable cushion going into the return leg in @entity61 next wednesday			1
in the @entity91 , @entity29 had to rely on a goal seconds from the end of extra time to beat @entity95 3 - 2 and progress to the semifinals			1
goals from @entity99 and @entity100 put @entity29 in a commanding position but two goals in four minutes from @entity103 and @entity104 pushed the match into extra time			0
but with a penalty shootout looming @entity107 's header crushed @entity95 and sent @entity29 through to the next round			0
in @entity57 's premier cup competition , the @entity111 , there were replay wins for @entity115 sides @entity114 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , though @entity119 succumbed to second tier @entity120 .			0

@entity2 beat @entity61 2 - 0 in the first leg of their @entity18 *quarterfinal* tie
a strike from @entity40 and an @entity42 own goal seal victory
win eases pressure on under fire @entity2 coach @entity15
@entity29 beat @entity95 3 - 2 with a goal seconds before tie went to penalties
