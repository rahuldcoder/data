@entity0 , @entity1 -- a controversial @entity4 group planning to stage an anti-war march through a town that receives @entity8 war dead will be banned in the @entity8 from thursday			1
@entity8 home secretary @entity9 prepared an order tuesday proscribing @entity11 , also known as @entity12			1
" @entity14 is a tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism and is not a course we take lightly , " @entity9 said in a statement			0
@entity11 is already banned under two other names in the @entity20 -- @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity9 said the ban would now also apply to " a number " of the other names the group goes by			2
the proscription does not need approval by @entity29 , because it is considered an amendment to the act , said the @entity33 spokeswoman , who did not give her name in line with policy			0
" we are clear that an organization should not be able to circumvent proscription by simply changing its name , " @entity9 said			0
the ban would prevent @entity11 from having meetings or raising money , and it would make attending a meeting or being a member of the group a crime			1
the group 's leader , controversial @entity8 @entity4 cleric @entity48 , had threatened to stage a march in the town of @entity52 as a protest against the war in @entity55			1
@entity48 said sunday , after news of @entity9 's plans , that the @entity33 could not shut him down			2
" we 're not going to stop because the government bans an organization , " he told @entity2 by phone			0
" if that means setting up another platform under another label , then so be it			0
" a ban " will just make the use of those names ... illegal			0
but @entity4 everywhere are obliged to work collectively to establish the @entity71 state and sharia law in the @entity8 or wherever they are -- those things ca n't change , " he added			0
the bodies of @entity8 war dead are traditionally brought to @entity52 , near a @entity77 base , when they are returned to the country			1
relatives and friends line the streets of the town along with local residents as hearses carry the flag - draped @entity8 remains , in scenes of public mourning widely reported by @entity8 media			0
@entity48 's proposal to march empty coffins through the streets drew fury and outrage			2
the @entity33 had said the march would be illegal if the group were banned , but the decision to proscribe the group was not caused only by its plans for the march , the @entity33 said			2
@entity48 has never announced a date for his march and area police said he had not contacted them about it , as march organizers are required to do beforehand			2
the @entity20 gives the home secretary the power to ban groups if the punishment is " proportionate and based on evidence that a group is concerned in terrorism as defined in the @entity20 , " according to the @entity33			1
according to the law , groups can be banned if they commit or participate in terrorism ; prepare for terrorism ; or promote or encourage terrorism			0
the home secretary can also take into account factors such as specific threats posed to the @entity8 or @entity8 nationals overseas , and the extent of the group 's presence in the @entity8 .			1

@entity128 on @entity11 , also known as @entity12 , will take effect thursday
@entity132 group proposed to march through town where war dead brought home
group is already banned under two other names in the @entity20 -- @entity21 and @entity22
the group 's leader @entity48 said the ban would not stop them
