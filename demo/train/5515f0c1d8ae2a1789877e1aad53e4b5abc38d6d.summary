-- if you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen -- or so the saying goes			2
but in the pressure cooker atmosphere of the @entity7 , where world - changing decisions are made on a daily basis , the kitchen could well be the coolest room in the building			1
the chef feeding the most powerful man on the planet uses few words as she kneads , stirs , and whips ; her style likened to a " baseball coach " who calmly relays orders through hand signals			1
" i think ' baseball coach ' is a great analogy because everybody has their own positions , everybody has their own plays to make , " says chef @entity22 , in an accent that wavers between her native @entity24 , and adopted home of @entity26			1
" you look at everyone 's strengths , everyone 's abilities and knowledge			2
so hopefully towards the end of your meal you hit a home run because you 're basically trying to rally your team to be the best at whatever they do			2
" while foul - mouthed celebrity chefs like @entity47 and @entity48 have made a name for themselves as the genius " enfant terribles " of the culinary world -- serving up incomparable food with dollops of expletives -- @entity22 takes a different approach			1
" i think of the skills you need to be a @entity7 chef , talent is number one , " says the woman who admits if she was to have any other job , it would be as a missionary			1
" but at the same time , temperance and the way you treat your co-workers would be up there as well			2
at the end of the day , whatever you do and whatever your mission is , it 's only successful because of your team			2
" @entity74 on her famous bosses preferred foods , and her lips are sealed			2
perhaps discretion -- as well as talent -- is part of the secret to her success			2
" when you work hard as the president , no matter who you are , my job as the @entity7 chef is to make sure that when they get home they 're very comfortable , and they 're happy with the food they 're served , " she said			1
" it 's really a matter of knowing each of them individually : do they like their pizza with thick or thin crusts ? what vegetables do they prefer ? that kind of thing			2
" all the president 's chefs for almost two decades , @entity22 has worked behind the scenes making sure the president , his family , and high - profile guests are so well fed they need n't give it a second thought -- they have enough on their plates as it is			1
the 51 - year - old has served under three presidents -- joining the @entity119 administration as a sous chef in 1995 , before the @entity122 government appointed her to the top job of executive chef in 2005			1
it 's a position she 's held throughout @entity132 's two terms , the president heralding a new era of sustainable and seasonal food growing , different from his predecessors			2
before she begins any meal , @entity74 now turns to the @entity7 's @entity135 to assess what 's on offer -- harvesting fresh vegetables , herbs , and even honey from the hive			1
" we have beautiful produce growing basically in our backyard , calling our name and saying ' hey , i 'm ready to be cooked today , ' " she says , her voice warm with affection for the patch of land , which since it was first sown by @entity154 in 2009 , has almost doubled in size to 1,500 sq ft. in a cooking session with @entity0 leading women presenter @entity156 , @entity22 found inspiration from " @entity158 , " picking fresh tomatoes , zucchini , and thyme for a summer vegetable crostata ( full recipe below )			1
" we do a lot of healthy cooking for the @entity168 , " says the mother of a 13 - year - old daughter			1
though in a country where over two thirds of adults are overweight or obese , it seems not everyone is taking her lead			2
the seasoned chef does n't measure her ingredients -- " after 20 or 30 years in the business , all the recipes just kind of get in there , " she says , pointing to her head			1
" it 's only the pastry chefs who measure things			2
the savory chefs , we just kind of wing it			0
but it all works out in the end			0
" salad girl to @entity7 chef feeding the @entity192 president is a long way from @entity22 's first job working as a " salad girl " in @entity26 hotels -- then a 23 - year - old newly - arrived to the @entity192 her older brother @entity197 remembers driving her to - and - from work at the @entity199 near @entity200 in his blue @entity202 van , where she would make caesar and cob salads			1
" even though you start off as a salad girl , you know i think in every type of work it 's always good to work your way from the bottom up , " says @entity22			1
" because you kind of learn from starting out -- things like organizational skills , and just basic knife techniques			0
" she later moved to @entity217 , working as a chef at two hotels , and doing a sixth - month stint in @entity221 , @entity222 , where she learnt classic @entity224 culinary techniques			1
then in 1995 , @entity7 chef @entity225 recruited @entity22 to work under the @entity119 administration			1
with a change of president came a change of taste , and @entity225 was fired by first lady @entity231 ten years later , after he " failed to satisfy her stylistic requirements			0
" around 450 people applied for the top job , which went to @entity22 -- the first woman and ethnic minority ever to hold the position			1
today , of the top 50 restaurants in the world , only three have a female head chef or owner			1
stately affair this " baseball coach " and her team of seven chefs need to keep their eye on the ball			0
at the @entity7 's recent @entity253 , over 400 guests sat down in a lavish outdoor pavilion for a four course meal -- that 's 1,600 plates of food timed to perfection			1
the @entity259 was halal dry aged beef , raised in @entity261 , marinated in chermoula -- a garlicky herb blend used in @entity264 -- and accompanied by plantain chips			0
it was one of the biggest events @entity74 has hosted in her 19 years at the @entity7 , and all the food that can be , is prepared two days in advance the menu however , is a delicate document requiring weeks of research into different guests dietary requirements , before it is given to the @entity231 for approval			1
" we still cook @entity192 food at its finest -- @entity192 regional cuisine and @entity192 products , " said @entity22			1
" but at the same time we want to honor our guests by featuring different spices and things that are very dear to them -- hence the plantains			0
" home cooking growing up as one of 11 children in @entity289 , @entity22 remembers " everything pretty much revolved around the kitchen and kitchen table			1
there was always the smell of food , always the sound of food			0
" as a third grader we were asked to start wrapping our first spring rolls			0
" the daughter of a school principal father and dressmaker mother ( " she made my wedding gown " ) , she remembers visiting her grandparents ' farm where everything from fresh meat to vegetables was sourced from the backyard			0
her kitchen today is still filled with tantalizing aromas -- though now it 's more likely to be her @entity316 chef husband @entity315 doing the cooking			1
after a long day feeding some of the most high - profile people on the globe , @entity74 does n't like to spend longer than an hour on her own dinner			1
though she does enjoy a specially concocted @entity316 / @entity24 stew -- " it 's full of potatoes and beef and fish sauce			1
it 's sounds kind of weird but it 's really good			0
" whether she 's also served it to the @entity192 president is another matter			0
