-- @entity2 troops have launched a " major operation " against @entity6 fighters in southern @entity7 , @entity2 military officials announced in @entity7 early thursday			1
@entity2 @entity8 gather for a briefing in @entity10 , @entity7 , on wednesday			1
about 4,000 @entity2 , mostly from the @entity8 , and 650 @entity7 soldiers and police launched @entity13 -- " strike of the sword " -- in the @entity17 valley , the @entity2 command in @entity15 announced			1
the push is the largest since the @entity20 began moving additional troops into the conflict this year , and it follows a @entity24 - led operation launched last week in the same region , the @entity8 said			0
it is also the first big move since @entity2 gen. @entity29 took over as the allied commander in @entity7 in mid-june			1
in @entity32 , a senior defense official said the size and scope of the new operation are " very significant			1
" " it 's not common for forces to operate at the brigade level , " the official said			0
" in fact , they often only conduct missions at the platoon level			0
and they 're going into the most troubled area of @entity7			0
" @entity10 , where much of the fighting is taking place , has been a hotbed of @entity6 violence in recent months			1
at least 25 @entity2 and @entity24 troops have been killed there in 2009			2
the defense official said the operation is a " tangible indication " of the new approach that @entity29 -- a former chief of the @entity20 's special operations command -- is bringing to the nearly eight - year war			0
" they 're not just doing an offensive push to get bad guys ; they 're going in to hold the area and stay there , " the official said			0
" this approach is indicative of @entity29 's philosophy : measuring success by the number of @entity7 protected , not bad guys killed			2
" the @entity67 administration has moved about 21,000 @entity2 troops to @entity7 , the original front in the war launched after the september 11 attacks			1
during his confirmation hearing in june , @entity29 told senators that the conflict requires a new focus on counterinsurgency to reduce violence and build support for the @entity2 - led @entity80 alliance among @entity7			1
" although i expect stiff fighting ahead , the measure of success will not be enemy killed			0
it will be shielding the @entity7 population from violence , " he said			2
the @entity88 fundamentalist @entity6 ruled most of @entity7 before its allies in the @entity91 terrorist network attacked @entity92 and @entity32 in 2001			2
though quickly toppled after the attacks , its leaders escaped , and the movement regrouped in the @entity7 countryside and across the border in @entity98			0
@entity0 @entity20 correspondent @entity99 contributed to this report .			0
