the @entity10 - led @entity9 in @entity1 said an @entity1 military pilot opened fire on international troops , sparking a " gunfight			1
" the @entity15 , however , claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had been working with the shooter for some time -- an assertion that @entity10 denied			1
also denying the @entity15 claim was the brother of the pilot			2
" my brother had no connections with the @entity15 , and i deny any claims of his connection by the @entity15 , " dr. @entity24 told a local @entity1 tv station in a telephone interview			1
he said his brother , @entity31 , 48 , was in the @entity32 for several years and was injured many times in plane crashes			0
the @entity1 military , however , listed the pilot as being 50 years old			0
" my brother had mental sickness as the result of the plane crashes in ' 80s and also he had economic problems , too , " @entity24 told local television			0
one witness , @entity43 , a military pilot at @entity44 , told @entity2 that he jumped from a second floor window to the ground during the incident			0
he saw foreigners laying on the ground inside the first floor , he said			0
" he was religious person , but i 'm not sure if he had mental illness , " @entity43 said of @entity31 , the pilot			0
the shooting started at the @entity1 national air force compound at @entity56 after an argument between the @entity1 pilot and an international colleague , officials said			1
the @entity10 - led force said the @entity1 military pilot opened fire on international trainers and a " gunfight " ensued			1
" a 50 - year - old man opened fire at armed @entity5 military soldiers inside the airport after an argument between them turned serious , " said col. @entity65 , chief of public relations for the @entity67 at @entity0 military airport			1
@entity10 said the confrontation took place at 10:25 a.m. at the airport , where a quick - reaction force responded to a " small arms fire incident			1
" the airport is home to @entity78			0
an initial report indicates the attack occurred in a meeting room at the @entity32 headquarters , a location operated and secured by @entity1 , a @entity5 military official told @entity2			1
the @entity10 - led force is investigating , the official said			1
@entity1 president @entity86 condemned the killings " by an @entity1 military pilot			0
" @entity89 , a spokesman for the @entity90 , said the killings upset defense minister @entity92 and that " he shares the pain with the families of the victims			0
" despite the account by international troops , a @entity15 spokesman said a man named @entity100 was responsible			2
" one suicide attacker ... managed to attack an @entity1 military unit and has managed to kill many @entity1 and international soldiers , " @entity15 spokesman @entity101 said			2
the @entity15 said the man killed nine foreigners and five @entity1 before being killed by the @entity1 army			2
" we had worked hard on this plan for a long time , " @entity101 told @entity2			0
" he was cooperating with us since long time and he was providing us information about military air operations for a long time			2
" @entity10 disputed the @entity15 claim			1
" we do not know why it started but there is no indication that a suicide bomber was involved and there are no reports that someone managed to get into the base to do this , " the @entity10 - led force said in a statement			2
the @entity15 has claimed responsibility for previous conflicts between @entity10 service members and members of the @entity1 military			1
@entity2 could not independently verify the group 's claims			0
the @entity15 said the man was once a pilot in an @entity1 regime in the late 1980s and early 1990s			2
" since the current @entity1 air forces have no planes , he was just going to @entity0 airport to show up and earn his salary for a long time , " @entity101 told @entity2			0
the man " was holding the rank of colonel at the time and he had an @entity139 with him			0
after his bullets were finished , then he was shot to death by armed forces , " @entity101 told @entity2			0
there was confusion about the death toll			0
the @entity10 - led force initially said six service members were killed			1
it raised that toll to nine but backed away temporarily before saying again that the shooting killed nine people -- eight international service members and a civilian contractor			0
the @entity151 confirmed that all were @entity5			1
later wednesday @entity10 announced that two additional service members were killed in attacks elsewhere in the country , bringing the day 's total number of @entity10 casualties to at least 11			1
violence between @entity1 forces and @entity10 troops is a matter of extreme concern for @entity10 officials , and it is growing in frequency			1
there have been 36 @entity10 deaths in the past two years attributed to attacks by people perceived to be @entity1 soldiers or police			2
officials fear that the increasing frequency of the attacks could undermine trust between @entity10 troops and the @entity1 they are working hard to prepare so they can eventually take over security in the country			1
the @entity15 's claim that the @entity1 gunman was their recruit follows a now - familiar pattern of the insurgency stating that attacks are theirs , even though @entity10 later suggests the gunman was acting out of personal motivation			1
out of 16 incidents of @entity1 forces shooting @entity10 personnel that @entity10 has investigated , eight have been determined to be motivated by combat stress on the part of the @entity1 attacker			2
the other eight investigations are undetermined			0
@entity2 's @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report			0
