-- she 's not so much the pinup girl of @entity4 horse racing as the " pinned - together girl			1
" @entity6 has been a trailblazer for female jockeys in the @entity4 , but it 's taken its toll on her tiny frame -- and she does n't mind at all			1
" i could break bones all day long , " says the 31 - year - old , who once received fan mail addressed to " @entity6 -- hospitalized somewhere in @entity15			1
" " i do the same as the lads and get injured the same , " she adds			0
" it 's not a man 's world , not at all			1
okay , more men do it but there are women too			2
" a year ago @entity6 lay crumpled on the turf at @entity27			1
she had moved her mount @entity28 to the inside rail to vie for victory in the home straight , but the horse clipped the heels of a rival and crashed to the ground at full pelt on top of her			0
her pelvis was broken , along with three vertebrae , just 10 days after she returned to racing following five weeks out with a broken ankle -- which to this day is still held together by screws			1
@entity6 's most serious accident was in 2009 , when she was also trampled by her horse			1
she was found on the turf by medical staff with blood oozing from both her ears and her nose			0
" i do n't remember a thing , which is odd as i think i was conscious at the time , " she says			0
" with all the blood , it was obvious i 'd bruised my brain quite badly			0
it was n't stressful for me but it was for my family as it was a case of ' how bad is this ' for them			0
was i going to be brain - damaged for life ? " she made a full recovery but was then told by authorities she could not race for a full year , a decision she later appealed with the backing of her family -- and won 60 races that shortened season			1
" my family hate the injuries as it 's always a case of ' let 's go to hospital and see how bad it is , ' " she admits , " but when i 'm not training i 'm just annoying , ringing them the whole time , asking what they 're doing			1
" so i think they 're happier when i get back riding			0
" in 2008 , @entity6 was the first female jockey to ride 100 winners in a @entity4 season , from nearly 1,000 races that year			1
she was the first past 500 career victories , the first outright group 1 winner and , in reality , the first from @entity4 to have forged a full - time career in horse racing			1
@entity6 has more than 50,000 @entity88 followers , making her more popular on the social website than high - profile @entity91 jockeys @entity93 and @entity94 , who have the edge in on - track wins			1
her time at the top has coincided with an increasing number of women coming through the ranks in both her domain of flat racing as well as jump racing , but she is reluctant to reflect on the influence she has had on them			1
" i feel happy for what i 've done , personal pride , but anything more than that i do n't think i 'll appreciate until i stop riding , " says @entity6 , whose first race was in 2000 -- almost three decades after women were first permitted to compete by the @entity109			1
" i might look back and think , ' actually , i did quite well with that			0
' but as i said , i work with the lads and like the lads			0
i do n't feel any different and i do n't get treated any differently by the other jockeys or trainers			0
" one difference is that at race meetings the two changing rooms are divided between the sexes , which can sometimes mean @entity6 has a room to herself			1
" i love that as i can have a bit of a lie - down , so that 's a perk , " she admits			1
despite her down - to - earth tomboy attitude , she did wryly admit to @entity128 's website this year that she had once won a race on a horse called @entity131 -- whose mother was named @entity133			2
but more of an honor has been riding winners owned by @entity4 's @entity136 -- the grand patron of the nation 's racing and breeding scene			2
unlike most of her peers , @entity6 did not come from a racing background			1
she hopes that will inspire aspiring riders to think , " if @entity6 's done it , why ca n't i ? " her mother used to be a freelance horse - riding instructor and now runs a business finding new homes for retired racehorses , but the track was never a great interest in the @entity6 household			1
" actually it still is n't , " says @entity6			2
" my parents like the @entity160 ( a prestigious event held at @entity162 where she has competed in an all - female team ) and , if i 've got a ride in a big race , they 'll watch it			2
but the main follower is my nanna			0
" she 'll look up my races the night before and know where i 'm riding			0
if i win a race she always tells my mum so , after every win , i 'll get a text from my nanna and my mum			0
" her pathway into the sport was through a one - off taster session at a horse - racing school a friend was attending			2
she tagged along and that was it ... she was hooked			0
" i left school and was n't that interested in anything , " @entity6 says			2
" i did quite well at @entity182 and textiles but this happened			0
it was then i became determined to be the best i could be , and i think that would have been the same whatever work i 'd got into			0
" not once have her family asked her to give up the sport she loves : " i think they know it would make me even more determined			0
" and worrying about the risks is not an option -- if she did , @entity6 fears she would lose the courage to ride again			2
as proof of her determination , she has twice ridden @entity28 since last year 's accident			2
she does , though , with her warped sense of humor , like to blame her previous brain injury on " when i do stupid things , which is often " -- but the reality is there are no scars from that 2009 incident			0
fully fit from her latest stint sidelined in the latter part of last year , @entity6 is again competing in the @entity208 , which began in may and culminates at @entity162 on october 18 in the richest racing day on the @entity4 calendar , with Â £ 3.75 million ( $ 6 million ) in prize money on offer across the five events			1
she won two @entity208 races in 2011 , ranking seventh in its inaugural year , but is playing catch - up this season			2
she has 25 wins overall from 377 starts , compared to 60 from 449 in 2013			0
" i 'm just happy to be riding			0
it 's not been my best season but i 'm not too worried by that -- there 's been some tough times to come back from , " @entity6 says			1
" you can be forgotten quickly as a jockey but i 'm getting my foot back in the door			2
i 'm getting plenty of rides and i 'm happy with that			0

**history** - making female jockey @entity6 has made **history** in flat racing
not even broken bones or head injuries have kept her away from the @entity238
@entity6 is *adamant* that being a jockey is not a man 's world and women can thrive
she says of her many injuries in her career : " i could break bones all day long "
