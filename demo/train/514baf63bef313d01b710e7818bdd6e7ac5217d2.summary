-- it 's really hard to take anything in sports seriously when you know the bottom line is always about maximizing the top line revenue			2
and the @entity8 's " new " @entity7 is a case in point			1
the guidelines could have created a monumental moment in @entity8 lawmaking			1
the league had the opportunity to show the world it is serious about the " @entity19 " domestic violence campaign			1
instead , @entity8 owners unanimously agreed to a policy that 's clearly about saving face , keeping players on the field , profits in their pockets and the power in commissioner @entity28 's hands			1
the most glaring problem with the " new " policy -- laid out in a handy flow chart -- is that it is almost identical to the old policy in that it is ambiguous , optional , case - by - case , complicated and at the discretion of the @entity8			1
consider a very predictable pattern -- a 911 call is received , police arrive at an @entity8 player 's home on a domestic violence report and arrest the @entity8 player			1
do we know for certain what the @entity8 do would do under this new policy ? no we do n't			1
what if the player 's pregnant fiancee is begging to drop the charges the next morning ? we do n't know what would happen then , either			1
the fact is , if the new policy was clear , you would be able to answer simple questions like these with a " yes " or " no " : 1			2
will a player be suspended immediately following an arrest ? ( no idea )			1
will a player be suspended if he is charged with a crime , following an arrest ? ( maybe )			2
will players who are arrested and investigated ( @entity64 ) be treated differently than those that plead no contest to a less offense ( @entity68 ) or for pretrial programs ( @entity70 ) ? ( probably )			2
will counseling be mandated for players who are arrested for violent offenses , or only " provided " ? ( who knows )			2
what does " assist " families actually mean ? ( @entity76 )			0
the limits of the new guidance is demonstrated by the @entity70 case , which , if the flow chart is followed logically , would end up having much the same result with the new approach as it did with the old one : the moment the league is notified of @entity70 's arrest at a casino , the @entity83 starts investigating in parallel with the criminal courts			0
the investigation , not arrests or charges being filed , determine whether or not @entity70 is put on paid leave			0
when the investigation is complete , special counsel determines discipline			0
if there is a criminal conviction , the baseline for violent crimes is a six game suspension , unpaid			0
according to the flowchart , @entity70 's fiancee would have access to " @entity104 " @entity105 that include medical and counseling services			0
if @entity70 appeals , three outside experts would advise			0
but guess who gets final say over what ultimately happens to @entity70 ? @entity28 or his designee			0
unlike the new substance abuse policy finalized in september , there are no concrete answers as to what will be done , only what may be done			0
and the truth is , no corporation knows how to handle domestic violence			1
according to the @entity121 , only 20 % of employers surveyed have training on domestic violence issues			1
but there should be no such thing as an @entity8 investigation , unless it is substance abuse or conduct that impacts the on field performance of a player			1
the @entity8 simply can not handle criminal cases involving domestic violence , child abuse or sexual assault			1
what it can do is set conduct policies that are clear and provide counseling serves to players and families who need them			2
i keep hearing people say that domestic violence is a " complex " situation			1
that may be true , but great leaders make the complex simple			0
they use clarity in their convictions to define operating standards and conduct policies for their organizations			2
in this case , that would mean being crystal clear about what the @entity8 will tolerate and what it will not tolerate			1
the league should also make the arrest the trigger point			0
if you are arrested for any crime against your intimate partner , children or animals , or any violent crime , you should automatically be suspended for six games , with pay			0
if you are formally charged with a crime , you lose pay for those six games			0
it is at the individual team 's discretion to punish you further			0
if you are arrested a second time , you should be banished			0
a clear policy puts the onus on the players to conduct themselves in a way that does everything possible to minimize their chances of arrest			2
@entity185 leadership sends a message to the owners , employees , players and the world about what the @entity8 stands for			1
when a leader is clear , people know how to act because they know what to expect			0
@entity28 is paid healthily to set protocol and take responsibility for everything that happens at the @entity8			1
and yet still we have no idea what punishment you can expect to receive when you punch your wife or use a switch to spank your child			2
" we 've taken a black eye on this , " @entity206 's co-owner @entity205 said			0
yes , he actually said that			0
unfortunately , those @entity211 black eyes seem to be the only ones the @entity8 cares about			1
