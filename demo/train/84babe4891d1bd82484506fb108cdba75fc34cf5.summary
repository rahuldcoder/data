-- a zoo in @entity2 is the latest to be embroiled in controversy , after it not only killed a healthy bear cub but will now stuff and display it to teach children that " nature can be cruel			1
" details of the fate of the baby brown bear , known only as @entity11 , come on the heels of outrage over the killing by @entity16 's @entity15 of a young male giraffe named @entity18 and four lions			1
the @entity20 in the @entity2 city of @entity22 said it decided to put down the bear cub after its father , named @entity24 , mauled its sibling to death and threatened to do the same to @entity11			1
according to a media release , the zoo initially decided not to interfere with the bears ' " natural " behavior			2
but when it was observed that the mother , @entity33 , had begun neglecting @entity11 and that the father was roughing it up too , zoo staff decided in april it would be kinder to kill the youngster			1
this week , the zoo announced that the cub , whose remains were deep - frozen , would be thawed out and handed over to an expert taxidermist to be stuffed			1
the hide has been separated from the body and will be tanned and the body measured for a mold			0
explaining the process , the zoo said it considers it central to learning that animals are experienced in as natural a condition as possible , including contact with " animal materials " like hides , bones or fully stuffed creatures			1
it added , " an emotional experience takes priority , which brings nature closer to the children with all its facets -- ' nice ' or not -- and makes them tangible			2
" but criticism of the zoo 's actions has focused on the fact that the adult bears involved were hand - raised -- suggesting that their cubs could have been raised that way too			2
the daily newspaper @entity70 reported in april that the zoo had received a flood of public comment after @entity11 was killed			1
it quoted @entity75 , head of the @entity76 of @entity77 , as saying the zoo had acted " irresponsibly " in its care of the bears			0
" bears are loners and need room , and in zoos , there are already too many brown bears , " she said			0
" letting the two get pregnant was wrong			0
you ca n't leave wild animals in captivity to ' nature			0
' " whoever keeps them must take responsibility for them			0
" in march , after the controversy over the @entity15 's actions , @entity96 spokesman @entity95 told @entity0 that across the @entity100 zoos governed by the body , about 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed each year under programs to manage zoo populations			1
this includes " everything from tadpoles and insects up to charismatic megafauna like giraffes and lions , " he said , adding that it represents only 0.06 % of the zoos ' overall animal population			0
exact figures are hard to come by , but a few hundred of those killed by the zoos each year would be large animals , he said			2
@entity95 added that members of the public and animal rights groups tend to object only when zoos kill " cute , storybook animals , " rather than rodents or tadpoles .			0
