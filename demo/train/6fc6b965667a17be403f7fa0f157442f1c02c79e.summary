@entity0 -- a small , wealthy region feels at odds with @entity5 rule			1
taxes are too high ; political representation is limited ; the elite feels unheard and ill - treated ; unrest and popular opposition spread			0
hardliners in @entity12 advocate repression and have the ear of a new ruler			0
turmoil ensues and escalates until a major confrontation is inevitable			0
the situation in @entity19 in 2012 ? no. this is the @entity21 , in the 1560s and 1570s -- another prosperous region ruled by @entity5 , where citizens felt that their values and way of life were not respected by @entity12 policies			1
what started as a minor conflict escalated until it became the @entity32			0
by its end , @entity5 had permanently lost control of the @entity35			1
so what transformed minor differences between ruler and ruled into a life - and - death struggle ? it started with a potent mix of cultural differences and opposition to high taxation			0
the rebellion included men like @entity47 , a state councillor appointed to help the @entity48 in ruling the @entity35			1
his dynasty had no intention of rebellion at all in the beginning			0
until the crisis of 1566 -- 67 , leading @entity35 figures like @entity47 advocated moderate policies			1
protestants , according to @entity57 , should have the right to practice their religion , without public assemblies or services ; in other words , he only advocated freedom of conscience			0
he also opposed armed rebellion			0
within a few short years , @entity47 came to lead the military rebellion against @entity5 , the only superpower of the 16th century -- a rebellion so large and tenacious that it stretched @entity5 's vast financial and military resources to breaking point and beyond			2
in the end , @entity12 had to concede that it could not win ; the @entity35 gained their independence , and became one of the most economically successful countries in @entity77			1
what happened ? @entity5 reacted to the demands for religious tolerance by its subjects the way that imperial powers run by religious zealots often do -- with heavy - handed repression			1
@entity86 dispatched a large army under the count of @entity89 to the @entity21			0
@entity89 unleashed a fearsome military campaign against the rebels ; the counts of @entity93 and @entity94 , who had demanded religious freedom , were executed ; where cities resisted the @entity5 army , they were besieged and the entire population was put to the sword ( as happened in @entity101 )			2
@entity5 's attempt at military " roll back " in the @entity103 backfired			2
it radicalized views amongst the @entity35 elite			2
guilty of no crimes or acts of treason , @entity57 fled to @entity110 , fearing the worst			0
his properties were confiscated and his son abducted to @entity5			2
faced with personal persecution from the @entity5 side , @entity57 increasingly adopted radical policies			2
eventually , he came to favor military revolt and an end of @entity5 influence			1
@entity5 's giant military machine also faltered			2
unpaid troops mutinied in 1575 , and committed a major massacre when they attacked the loyal city of @entity125			0
almost overnight , the three - quarters of the @entity35 that had been loyal to the @entity48 switched sides ; it was @entity127 for @entity5 rule in the @entity103			1
the @entity21 were not the only part of the @entity130 to break free from @entity5 after a revolt against high taxation and invasive rule from @entity12 -- @entity134 also regained its freedom in the 17th century under similar circumstances			1
today , it is the turn of @entity19 to oppose the @entity12 government			2
again , a population and its elite feel culturally alienated , overtaxed , and unheard			0
positions are hardening quickly , on both sides			0
@entity143 : @entity145 's reluctant leader conflict looks inevitable -- and may even turn bloody			0
the @entity5 reaction to @entity149 requests for greater independence today is arguably equally intolerant ( but not yet as ferocious ) as @entity86 's attempt to subdue his @entity35 subjects in the @entity103			1
instead of political negotiations and enlightened discussions , there has been a wave of threats and a campaign of disinformation : @entity5 will throw an independent @entity19 out of the @entity160 ; it will saddle it with sky - high debts ; it will stop buying @entity149 products , or send in the tanks			1
there is a shocking contrast between the way that @entity168 has dealt with @entity170 demands for independence -- by allowing a referendum to go forward -- and the @entity5 reaction			1
if there is one lesson from history , it is simple -- repression , intimidation and intolerance typically make things worse			1
massive attempts at repression can easily backfire			0
@entity5 lost control of both the @entity35 provinces and of @entity134 after local revolts			1
the same pattern is also visible elsewhere : irish independence became inevitable after the @entity190 government overreacted to minor skirmishes in 1916 , sending in warships to bombard downtown @entity193 during the " @entity194			0
" the @entity32 against the @entity35 provided a basis for @entity5 's " @entity196 , " a powerful form of @entity199 propaganda that mixed facts and exaggerations to depict @entity5 as a cruel , intolerant , and illegitimate power			1
any overreaction to the coming referendum on @entity149 independence today has the potential to similarly blacken its image for decades to come , and to give the lie to the image of peace and prosperity that earned the @entity160 the @entity212 this year .			0

@entity19 is fighting for independence in @entity5 , which has been hit by crisis
the situation can be *compared* to the @entity35 revolt in the 1560s and 1570s
@entity5 has reacted to demands in the past with repression
history shows such *tactics* typically make things worse
