-- the gap between @entity3 's haves and have nots appears never to have been wider			1
while all - conquering @entity5 prepares for the title showdown in @entity7 , a cash - strapped team at the back of the grid has been forced to ask for donations from @entity3 fans to fund its participation in the final race of the season			1
@entity18 , like fellow minnow @entity16 , has gone into administration and has missed the last two races in the @entity21 and @entity22			1
desperate to compete in the 2014 season finale , the team launched # @entity25 with the express intention of raising £ 2.35 million ( $ 3.76m ) -- and set a self - imposed deadline of friday , november 14 to achieve the target			1
@entity18 is using a method called " crowdfunding , " where individuals or companies making a pledge are incentivized , depending on the amount promised			2
the @entity37 team 's administrators turned to one of the market leaders in this specialized area , @entity41 , to run the appeal with fans directed to its website to see what is on offer			1
about $ 5 dollars will get a funder a badge or t shirt			0
more expensive items would include a front wing from a 2013 car , with the highest prices reserved for individuals or companies wishing to have their name or logo emblazoned on the team 's cars			2
the approach has provoked a debate within @entity3 as to its merits -- with the sport 's commercial supremo @entity63 being typically blunt in his assessment			1
" i think it 's a disaster , " he told reporters at last weekend 's @entity22 @entity67			0
@entity69 , the co-founder of @entity41 , flatly rejected that criticism			0
" i think that 's a disappointing statement , " he told @entity0			0
" @entity18 has worked tremendously hard to compete in @entity3 and some of the goalposts have moved slightly over the last for or five years to make it even more difficult			1
" i think comments like that are not particularly helpful			0
" what is not in doubt is the appeal for cash has proved successful with over £ 1 million ( $ 1.6m ) raised in the first two days of the appeal and the halfway target reached by tuesday			1
items such as the front wings or team overalls were proving particularly popular with donors			0
it was @entity87 , the @entity37 administrator and for now its team principal , who came up with the idea , and like @entity69 is unapologetic about the approach			1
" there are 200 people in the ( @entity18 ) factory who were not paid for october and they deserve as much support as they can get , " he told @entity0			2
" he ( @entity63 ) has now had races where two teams were n't there and three others were hinting at boycotts , so that 's not good for him			1
" @entity87 believes that getting @entity18 to the start line in @entity7 -- where there will be " huge interest " in seeing which of the @entity5 pair of @entity108 or @entity109 takes the @entity3 title -- will help him firm up the interest shown by potential buyers of the team			1
" we are not talking about crowdfunding a team , we are talking about a single stepping stone to showcase it to investors in a race setting			2
" this is a sharp injection in the arm to cure an immediate financial crisis but they will only survive if a new purchaser comes forward , " he added			0
@entity69 said this " one - off " approach was new ground for his company as well			0
" it 's a deviation from our usual business model where investors get equity shares or an interest payment in return for their investment , " he said			0
" but it was an opportunity we could not set aside because @entity37 is such an iconic @entity136 brand and we are doing what we can to help out			2
" @entity18 is not even the first team with links to @entity3 to use crowdfunding to fund its activities			1
the iconic former @entity143 team has raised over $ 400,000 by this method as it attempts to return to the grid after a 20 - year absence			0
@entity87 is increasingly confident they will reach their ambitious target and line up on the grid on sunday week			0
" interest all over the world is growing exponentially , a mixture of enthusiasts who want to buy expensive things and even non sports fans with sympathy for our cause , " he said			0
" people like @entity159 ( @entity18 's engine supplier ) and @entity161 have also been incredibly supportive			1
" after the initial flurry of interest , donations slowed a little ahead of friday 's deadline , but according to @entity69 this is a familiar pattern			0
" there tends to be a real burst of activity , then a slight plateau in the middle , followed by a resurgence of interest as the deadline nears			0
" there are over a quarter of a million views on the page and i am really confident they are going to reach their target			0
" that will mean good news for @entity18 's @entity184 driver @entity183 , who has still to find a seat for the 2015 season			1
his @entity188 teammate @entity187 has been signed by @entity189 off the back of a big personal sponsorship package			0
exactly how many cars will be on the grid in @entity7 also remains an open question			0
@entity87 's firm @entity195 and @entity197 is a key player in the @entity136 restructuring business and he told @entity0 that his own sources within the industry were talking up a rescue bid for @entity16			2
reeling from the horrific crash which has left its star driver @entity206 in a critical but stable condition in a @entity184 hospital , the @entity204 - @entity203 team was dealt a further blow when its administrator announced last friday that it had folded			0
" the finality of that statement surprised me , " said @entity87			0
" i still think there could be more positive news for @entity16 ahead of the @entity7 race , " he added			2
the two points gained by @entity206 for a superb ninth placed finish in the @entity218 left @entity16 in ninth spot in the constructors ' standings			2
it would leave them set for a $ 50 million payout under @entity3 's complicated rewards structure , having pipped @entity37 for the vital 10th spot in the championship in 2013			1
by contrast , @entity5 will be set for a near $ 100 million payout in prize money for claiming top spot after a dominant season			2
but their operating budget , like those of other top teams such as @entity237 and @entity238 , is in excess of $ 300 million , dwarfing that of teams such as @entity18 and @entity16			1
they will surely never have to resort to what @entity63 labeled the " begging bowl " employed by @entity37 , but @entity87 has no regrets as he battles to save the team			1
he came up with the idea of using crowdfunding while cycling up the steep @entity249 in @entity250 on his way home , in some way symbolizing the uphill struggles of @entity18 since it entered @entity3 in 2010			1
" it 's such an interesting proposition , the belief that a team could be reconstituted by fan power , " he said .			2
