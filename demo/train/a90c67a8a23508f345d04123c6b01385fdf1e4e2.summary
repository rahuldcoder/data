eighteen errors lines up to cause last summer 's catastrophic derailment of a runaway train in the @entity6 town of @entity7 , @entity1 accident investigators said tuesday , concluding an investigation that has revealed serious safety lapses in the transport of crude oil through @entity1 and the @entity12			1
among the factors : a " weak safety culture " in the railroad that transported the oil ; a government agency that required safety plans from industry but did little to check them ; and a train that consisted almost entirely of substandard tanker cars			1
those tanker cars -- known as @entity24 -- still carry the bulk of the oil from the @entity27 oil fields of @entity28 to ports on the east coast of the @entity12 and @entity1 , although both countries -- spurred by the @entity7 tragedy -- are taking steps to phase them out			1
the @entity7 derailment was among the most disastrous in modern @entity35			2
forty - seven people died , some 40 buildings were destroyed and 53 vehicles were demolished when the 63 tank cars and two boxcars derailed and erupted in flames			0
about 2,000 residents of the community were evacuated			0
the @entity44 ( tsb ) listed 18 factors contributing to the disaster , but declined to say whether any were more serious than the others			1
the accident may have been avoided if any one of the 18 factors were not present , the @entity44 's @entity48 told reporters			1
" accidents never come down to a single individual , a single action or a single factor			0
you have to look at the whole context , " said tsb chair @entity56			1
crude oil shipments by rail have increased dramatically in the past decade as oil companies have perfected technologies to extract oil from shale			1
the increase took a number of people by surprise , including government regulators , @entity56 said			1
police : evidence criminal act may have led to crash in @entity1 , rail shipments of oil have increased from a mere 500 carloads in 2009 to 160,000 in 2013			1
in the @entity12 , shipments have increased from 10,800 carloads to 400,000 in the same period			0
@entity56 and @entity48 said @entity78 has taken measures of phase out the use of @entity24 - 111 tankers -- one of three recommendations made in january in an unprecedented joint recommendation by the safety boards of both countries			0
but they sidestepped questions about whether newer , stronger tankers would have remained intact in the @entity91			0
tsb investigator @entity92 said there are " not enough data points " to determine whether newer tankers would have survived the incident			0
the incident occurred july 6 , 2013 , when an engineer for the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) parked the train for the night on a descending grade			1
runaway train devastates @entity1 town : the route , the damage , the aftermath investigators said the engineer set seven of the train 's hand brakes , far fewer than the 17 to 26 needed to prevent the train from rolling			2
the additional holding power of the train 's air brakes kept the train secure at first			0
but when a fire broke out in the lead locomotive because of a mechanical problem , the locomotive was shut down , an no additional air was provided to the air brakes			0
a slow air leak led to the failure of the air brakes , and the unattended train rolled down the incline , reaching a top speed of 65 miles per hour before derailing seven miles away at a curve in @entity7			2
many of the cars were split open , releasing large amounts of crude oil , which ignited , causing large fireballs and a pool fire			0
the @entity44 said the railroad cut corners on engine maintenance and training , and that crude oil trains " ran largely unchecked " by @entity78 , the @entity1 equivalent of the @entity12 @entity141			1
opinion : stop shipping volatile oil by rail @entity99 filed for bankruptcy after the disaster			2
the railroad 's @entity1 assets have been sold			2
investigators also discovered that the oil was improperly described in shipping documents			0
it was labeled as a " @entity154 " product , but was shipped as a less volatile @entity156 product			0
following the @entity7 disaster , the @entity12 @entity157 and the @entity158 ( @entity158 ) issued a safety advisory and announced an operation to conduct unannounced inspections and testing of the crude oil that is being shipped by rail			1
@entity56 , the tsb chair , said governments and the rail industry have made improvements , but more needs to be done			1
@entity1 " still allows trains to be left unattended on a descending grade , " she said			2
the government needs to do more than rubber - stamp companies ' @entity173 , which are intended to detect and address safety issues			2
" it 's not enough for a @entity173 on paper ; that sms has to work , to do what it was designed to do , " she said			0
loss , now anger , fuel a town forever changed			0

the @entity7 rail disaster of july 2013 killed *47* people ,
@entity1 safety agency report faults railroad , government and train itself
tsb : accident may have been avoided if any one of 18 factors were not present
recent spike in rail shipments of oil surprised even government regulators , says tsb chair
