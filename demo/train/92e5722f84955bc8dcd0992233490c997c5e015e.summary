so far , it least , it looks like a coalition of the not - so - willing to help president @entity4 combat @entity3			1
public statements of support from key allies have yet to be matched by concrete commitments to the proposed coalition , particularly for expanded military strikes against the @entity12 jihadists rampaging through northern @entity13 from @entity14			1
secretary of state @entity16 's swing through the @entity17 this week garnered broad pledges of backing , but few specifics made public			1
in @entity21 on friday , @entity16 met with top leaders and told reporters of positive meetings , but he announced no details regarding possible contributions from one of @entity14 's neighbors			1
@entity16 : more than 40 countries offered assistance " it 's just not appropriate to start laying out , as we are in the process of talking to all these countries , which country is doing what , " he told reporters			1
" next week , i 'll be testifying before @entity39 and we 'll have more of the reports back in as others are talking to various countries and we 'll have a better sense of where we stand on that			2
" he added : " i will tell you this : more than 40 countries had already offered assistance of one kind or another before i left @entity50			2
" earlier this week , @entity51 needed by @entity4 to legitimize regional support for going after @entity3 put a qualifier on military contributions , saying they would participate " as appropriate			1
" meanwhile , @entity56 partners @entity57 and @entity58 have sent mixed signals on participating in airstrikes on @entity3 targets in @entity14 , while @entity62 ruled it out but committed to military support in @entity13			2
difficulty getting a coalition " there is likely to be a lot of difficulty getting a coalition beyond a limited approach , especially regarding @entity75 efforts to attack @entity3 in @entity14 , " said @entity66 , a fellow at the @entity68 's @entity67 for the @entity17			1
different countries have different reasons to be wary of getting fully involved in the @entity75 - led coalition			1
for example , @entity21 has internal political considerations , as well as 49 @entity21 diplomats taken hostage by @entity3 , @entity66 noted			2
@entity75 officials say @entity21 has taken steps to cut the flow of money to @entity3 and denied entry to or deported several thousand foreign fighters heading to @entity14 to join the extremists			2
now they look for @entity21 to stop oil exports from @entity3 - held areas that bring more funding to the group			1
while @entity13 's new government will fully join the @entity75 - led strategy announced this week by @entity4 , major regional players including @entity21 , @entity95 and @entity96 were unlikely to be as supportive , @entity66 said			1
" quiet cooperation " even staunch @entity75 ally @entity100 , a certain backer , would likely choose what @entity66 called " quiet cooperation			1
" " they 're not going to come out all guns blazing and engage jihadists , " he said			2
@entity4 's strategy represents a potential milestone in the growing regional conflict , which involves @entity14 's civil war , @entity13 's continuing instability and the emergence of the extremists known as @entity3 , @entity112 and @entity113 into a potent and growing terrorist force that controls an area larger than the @entity57			0
in his nationally televised speech wednesday to present the strategy , @entity4 called for airstrikes on @entity3 targets in @entity13 and @entity14 to " hunt down terrorists who threaten our country , wherever they are			0
" he also announced more military aid and other support for @entity13 forces and @entity14 opposition groups fighting @entity3 extremists on the ground , as well as increased counterterrorism efforts to cut off the group 's funding and the flow of foreign fighters from @entity134 and elsewhere joining its ranks			1
the goal , he said , was to " dismantle and ultimately destroy " @entity3			0
@entity66 , however , called the ultimate objective unattainable and said that reality made regional nations cautious about joining the coalition effort			0
degrade realistic ; destroy " not going to happen " " degrade might be realistic			0
destroy is not going to happen , " he said , noting that wiping out @entity3 would require a ground campaign			0
he also called unrealistic any expectation that @entity12 nations in the region would send combat troops to take on @entity3 , saying , " i 'm sure it would make the administration 's life easier , but it 's not going to happen			0
" " this whole thing has been covered by deep suspicions and doubts about whether the @entity75 is truly committed to destroying this group , " @entity66 said			0
@entity4 has ruled out @entity75 troops on the ground in @entity13 and by extension @entity14 , leaving it @entity13 forces as well as @entity14 opposition groups that are fighting both the government of president @entity162 and @entity3			0
" ultimately , the responsibility for taking the fight to @entity112 on the ground in @entity14 can and should be @entity14 fighters , " @entity164 spokesman @entity163 said friday			0
" and the question is what kind of support can we offer them			0
and it 's the president 's view that the international community can provide support to them in two ways			0
one is ramping up our training and equipping mission			0
and two is the deployment of @entity75 and allied airstrikes in support of their efforts on the ground			1
" so far , though , no allies have signed on to joining @entity75 airstrikes on @entity3 targets in @entity14			2
@entity62 ruled it out completely , pledging military aid to @entity13 forces include @entity195 fighters in the north , while officials in @entity57 and @entity58 gave conflicting responses that signaled internal debate influenced by domestic politics .			0
