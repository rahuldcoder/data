-- " be sure that buttocks and female breasts are adequately covered			0
" " thong type costumes are problematic			0
" " avoid sheer see - through clothing			0
" is this the new edict of a religiously conservative government that wants to make sure that men -- and especially women -- are covered up ? could it be the dress code for visiting the @entity10 , the @entity11 , the @entity12 or other holy sites ? nope , these words are actually part of the wardrobe advisory e-mail that @entity17 sent to attendees of this sunday 's @entity19			1
yep , @entity17 , the network that brought you a promo during last week 's @entity22 for its show , " 2 @entity23 , " featuring the show 's young female stars writhing on a stripper pole , is now concerned about sending the wrong message			1
the language that @entity17 used in explaining its clothing recommendations is actually hilarious -- it seems to have been written by a cross between an elderly lawyer and @entity32 from " @entity33			1
" predicting the 2013 @entity19 winners here are some of the highlights : talent should , " avoid exposing bare fleshy under curves of the buttocks and buttock crack			2
" what exactly is " fleshy under curves " and why does it sound so oddly hot ? ( and by frowning upon the showing of buttock cracks , does this mean that many of the union plumbers working at the @entity19 venue may also have wardrobe problems ? ) @entity17 wants attendees to avoid outfits that could " expose female breast nipples			1
" and the network also put its foot down on clothes that expose the " bare sides " of breasts , aka , the famed and increasingly popular " sideboob			0
" however , the most bizarrely worded wardrobe line is that talent must , " be sure that the genital region is adequately covered so that there is no visible ' puffy ' bare skin exposure			0
" what exactly is " puffy " bare skin ? is that code for some word i do n't know about ? and why did @entity17 put the word " puffy " in quotes ? it sounds even dirtier that way			2
my big question is this : what caused @entity17 to be so concerned that this year it issued a written wardrobe advisory ? @entity17 has aired the @entity19 for more than 40 straight years , dating back to 1973			1
obviously over that time we have seen some pretty @entity80 © outfits			0
could it be because @entity17 wants to appease conservatives who freaked out over the outfit @entity84 wore while performing in the @entity22 halftime show ? 21 questions for the 2012 @entity19 right - wing radio host @entity87 protested @entity84 's outfit with a sarcastic tweet : " very family - friendly dancing s&m by @entity84			1
what every girl shd aspire to			0
" a writer at " the @entity95 " penned a column entitled , " put a dress on , " demanding that @entity84 not wear a " black teddy " on stage but something less revealing			0
( of course , if similar language was espoused from people in the @entity105 world , these same conservatives would denounce it as muslims attempting to oppress women , but it 's somehow ok when they do it			1
) the real reason is unclear			0
@entity17 declined to officially comment but sources there stated that a similar verbal wardrobe warning had been given in the past			1
what is clear is that this wardrobe advisory is not gender neutral			1
its very language tells women what they can not wear			0
" female breasts " must be adequately covered			0
" female breast nipples " must not be exposed			0
even where there 's no specific gender reference , we all understand that no one is concerned that @entity129 , who is nominated for a @entity19 this year , will show up exposing the , " bare fleshy under curves " of his buttocks			1
no , @entity17 is more concerned with making sure that women are properly covered			1
' @entity134 , lesson beyond the apparent sexism of the wardrobe advisory , we also need to keep in mind that freedom of expression is not just words			1
freedom of expression also includes expressing yourself through the clothes you wear , especially for the talented musical artists attending the @entity19			2
these performers should be able to dress any way they choose , both men and women			2
a big part of the @entity19 is enjoying the range of outfits worn , from the glamorous to the provocative to ones that make you wonder what was the bet the person lost that made them wear that outfit -- i 'm looking at you @entity161 , who last year dressed like a bright red version of " the @entity163 " and was accompanied by a man dressed like the pope			2
and of course , if someone wears an outfit that truly violates @entity169 regulations , then @entity17 should not allow that person on camera			2
that is not only @entity17 ' right , it 's @entity17 ' obligation			2
but the @entity17 wardrobe advisory note goes too far -- it both hampers creativity and imposes restrictions that are sexist			1
i hope that at sunday 's @entity19 we see people dressed as creatively and provocatively as they choose			1
part of me even hopes that @entity129 wears an outfit that exposes his " puffy " bare skin -- whatever that may be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0

@entity17 sent a wardrobe advisory e-mail to @entity19 attendees to cover up well
@entity186 : the note is not only hilarious , it 's also sexist toward women
he says maybe @entity17 is trying to appease conservatives like @entity87
@entity186 : artists should be able to dress as creatively and provocatively as they choose
