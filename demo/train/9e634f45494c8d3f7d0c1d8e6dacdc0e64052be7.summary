-- @entity2 co-owner @entity1 made it clear friday that he was n't going away , suing the @entity4 for more than $ 1 billion for its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise			1
the lawsuit -- which was provided to @entity0 by @entity1 's lawyer and was n't unexpected -- marks the latest twist in a case that began last month when @entity12 posted a recording in which @entity1 made racist comments			1
it also comes amid fresh questions about the 80 - year - old 's mental state , raising the issue of how much control he has or should have with the @entity22			0
@entity1 's inflammatory remarks to his companion , @entity24 , spawned outrage among @entity4 fans , players and executives			1
chief among the latter was @entity4 commissioner @entity31 , who banned @entity1 from the league , fined him $ 2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise			1
@entity1 's camp , in its lawsuit , claims that the move to terminate his ownership " is unconstitutional , in breach of contract , in restraint of trade , in breach of fiduciary duties and ... is malicious and oppressive			1
" among other allegations , @entity1 says in the lawsuit that he never violated the @entity4 's constitution and that the recording that spawned this scandal -- and that recording , it says , is the sole base of the @entity4 charges against him -- is against @entity56 law			1
the lawsuit also states that " the forced sale of the @entity2 threatens not only to produce a lower price than a non-forced sale , but more importantly , it injures competition and forces antitrust injury by making the ... market unresponsive to ... the operation of the free market			1
" " ( @entity1 believes ) that the @entity4 's forced sale ... would create damages of at least $ 1 billion , which includes capital gains taxes , unnecessary and increased investment - banking fees , legal and transactional costs , and the loss of all future appreciation in the @entity2 franchise value , " it adds			1
the filing in a federal court in @entity56 comes a day after @entity1 's estranged wife , @entity79 , agreed to sell the @entity2 to former @entity81 ceo @entity80 for $ 2 billion			1
it also comes days before the @entity4 board of governors had been set for a vote that could have forced the @entity85 to give up that team			1
the @entity4 said friday that the june 3 meeting has been canceled -- something @entity1 himself had asked for in his lawsuit -- due to the @entity2 ' pending sale to @entity80			1
on friday , former @entity93 ceo and current interim @entity2 ceo @entity92 spoke to @entity0 affiliate @entity95 about the team 's sale			1
" i hope obviously this thing goes through , the sooner this thing is resolved , the better for everybody , the league , the @entity85 , certainly for the team and for the staff , to have some certainty around who 's going to own the team going forward and sort of pick up on the momentum that the team has built towards the end of the season			2
i think it 's a big plus , " @entity111 said			0
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity115 on friday , @entity2 guard @entity113 said he feels that the new ownership will cement a team on its way up			2
" we 're on the verge of doing something great , " @entity113 said			0
he added that " as a professional athlete , you always have distractions , " but " you never want to be part of a national scandal			0
" @entity113 also said that a quick resolution is what he hopes for			0
" as a player and as a franchise , you want finality , " @entity113 said			0
however , friday 's lawsuit seems to indicate that a quick resolution may not happen			0
" the @entity4 , @entity135 and the @entity136 today resolved their dispute over the ownership of the @entity2 , " the @entity4 said in a statement			2
" mrs. @entity135 and the @entity136 also agreed not to sue the @entity4 and to indemnify the @entity4 against lawsuits from others , including from @entity1			1
" the lawsuit filed friday listed @entity1 and the @entity1 family trust as plaintiffs			0
that fact speaks to yet another aspect of this story that 's up in the air : who controls the @entity1 family trust , which is the official owner of the @entity2 ? lawyer : @entity1 ' does n't want to fight ' with estranged wife the question of whether @entity1 has standing over the @entity4 franchise does n't just have to do with his racist comments but , more generally , his mental state			1
two neurologists have deemed @entity1 to be mentally incapacitated , two sources with detailed knowledge of the situation told @entity0 on friday			0
@entity1 's lawyer , @entity161 , firmly shot down this report , calling such a declaration a " vast overstatement			2
" @entity161 said the 80 - year - old was diagnosed with a " modest mental impairment " or a " slowing down			0
" " ( @entity85 is ) far from incapacitated , " his lawyer said			0
according to one of the sources , there is a provision in the @entity1 family trust that says if either @entity1 or his estranged wife , @entity135 , become mentally incapacitated , then the other becomes the sole trustee			2
that could smooth the way for the deal that @entity135 negotiated with @entity80			0
so , too , could something @entity1 acknowledged in his lawsuit friday : that another of his lawyers wrote a letter to the @entity4 on may 20 stating that " mr. @entity1 agrees to the sale of his interest in the @entity2			1
" " this letter confirms that @entity1 authorizes @entity135 to negotiate with the @entity4 regarding all issues in connection with a sale of the @entity2 team , " lawyer @entity187 wrote			1
where does @entity1 stand , then , on whether the team should be sold ? his lawsuit makes clear that he believes the @entity4 has no right to force such a sale , just as the league was wrong in banning him for life and fining him			1
in addition to damages , the lawsuit seeks a restraining order			0
it also acknowledges the $ 2 billion agreement that his estranged wife reached with @entity80			1
asked about such a sale on friday , before the @entity207 meeting was canceled , @entity161 said that @entity1 " is looking at the whole situation and evaluating where to go from here			2
" " he does n't want to fight with @entity79			0
that 's the bottom line , " @entity161 said			0
@entity85 could make huge profit whatever happens with @entity1 's lawsuit , there 's no question that , if the sale goes through , it would mean a huge windfall for him and his family			1
the real estate investor bought the @entity2 for about $ 12 million in 1981			0
three - quarters of the @entity4 board of governors would have to ok any deal with @entity80			2
if they do at the agreed - upon price , it would be the largest sum paid for an @entity4 franchise by far			2
last month , the @entity228 , a team with a losing record in a small television market , sold for $ 550 million			0
in a statement earlier friday , @entity135 confirmed the deal with @entity80 and how it would revamp the team 's ownership			2
" we have worked for 33 years to build the @entity2 into a premiere @entity4 franchise , " she said in a statement			2
" i am confident that @entity80 will take the team to new levels of success			0
" who is @entity80 ? the @entity85 's would - be successor as owner , @entity80 , is worth $ 20 billion , according to @entity243			2
@entity80 was recently involved in an unsuccessful effort to buy the @entity245 and move them to @entity246 , near where @entity81 is based			0
but in a statement friday , he indicated that the @entity2 would stay in @entity56			0
and i intend to do everything in my power to ensure that the @entity2 continue to win -- and win big -- in @entity252 , " @entity80 said friday			0
how @entity80 's $ 2 billion @entity2 deal could pay off @entity0 's @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 contributed to this report .			1

@entity261 says basis for the @entity4 charge is " malicious and oppressive "
the suit acknowledges that @entity1 gave his wife the ok to sell team
it also alleges that a forced sale will lower the franchise 's value
his wife , @entity79 , recently reached a deal to sell the team for $ 2 billion
