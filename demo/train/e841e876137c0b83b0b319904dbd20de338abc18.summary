-- the @entity2 is reviewing a request from 13 states on how to acquire an execution drug no longer made in the @entity6 and whether the federal government would share its supplies , a federal spokeswoman said wednesday			1
the sole @entity6 manufacturer of sodium thiopental , an anesthetic used as part of the lethal three - drug cocktail , announced last month that it would stop making the drug because the producer never intended it to be used to kill people			1
the @entity6 shortage of sodium thiopental , also used as an anesthetic for brief surgical procedures , may force states to postpone executions and has forced them to look outside the country for a supply or come up with alternatives			1
those substitutes have n't been without controversy			0
in december , @entity27 used an anesthetic commonly used to euthanize animals to execute @entity30 for killing a cellmate			0
additional controversy surfaced last week about the drug 's shortage when six death row inmates filed a federal lawsuit seeking to prevent the @entity37 from importing the drug , saying the imports may be unsafe			1
in a letter last month to @entity6 attorney general @entity41 , the attorneys general in 13 states said injection is the execution method in the majority of states with a death penalty , and protocols in those states use sodium thiopental , " an ultra-short - acting barbiturate			1
" " sodium thiopental is in very short supply worldwide and , for various reasons , essentially unavailable on the open market , " the letter said			2
" for those jurisdictions that have the drug available , their supplies are very small -- measured in a handful of doses			2
the result is that many jurisdictions shortly will be unable to perform executions in cases where appeals have been exhausted and governors have signed death warrants			2
" therefore , we solicit your assistance in either identifying an appropriate source for sodium thiopental or making supplies held by the federal government available to the states , " the letter said			1
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity80 said wednesday that federal officials have received the communication			0
" we 'll review the letter , " she said			0
@entity83 is one of the 13 states signing the letter and has run out of the execution drug , said spokesman @entity87 of the @entity88			1
" it 's pretty straightforward			0
we do n't have a supply of the drug so we 're looking for sources for them should we need them , " @entity87 said			2
@entity83 , which has n't had an execution since 1997 , does n't have any lethal injections scheduled , though more than 30 men are on death row , he said			1
all those cases are in various stages of appeal , he said			0
the other states signing the letter are @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
@entity115 , which was n't part of the letter , performs the most executions in the country and is also facing a shortage of the drug , said spokesman @entity121 of the @entity122			2
@entity115 has enough sodium thiopental to carry out this month 's two scheduled executions , on february 15 and february 22 , but the state 's stock of the drug will reach its expiration date in march , @entity121 said			1
@entity115 has executions scheduled in april , may and july , he said			0
" the agency is exploring all of its options at this point , including seeking an alternative source of sodium thiopental as well as seeking an alternative drug to use in a lethal injection process , " @entity121 said			1
switching to an alternative drug could be done administratively , but switching to a different execution method would require legislative approval , @entity121 said			0
" if we were to go to a firing squad , that would be a change in the execution method " requiring lawmakers ' approval , @entity121 said			0
in their recently filed federal lawsuit , death row convicts are seeking an injunction barring future imports of the drug and removal of supplies of the drug already in possession of state governments			1
the lawsuit represents inmates in @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity111			0
the @entity37 continues to allow states to import " bulk amounts " of the drug for use in lethal injection without vetting it to ensure it meets regulatory standards , the lawsuit charges			1
" the imported thiopental in question has not been listed with @entity37 , was manufactured by foreign companies that have not registered with @entity37 , and was exported by a wholesaler located in the @entity177 , " says the lawsuit , filed in @entity172 in the @entity113			0
" @entity37 has not determined whether the thiopental being imported into the @entity6 is safe and effective , whether the imported thiopental is adulterated or whether the imported thiopental is counterfeit , " the suit says			2
an @entity37 spokesman declined to comment last week , citing the litigation .			0

sodium thiopental is part of three - drug cocktail used in lethal injection
the @entity6 manufacturer of the drug said last month it would stop making the drug
13 states that use the drug in executions are asking feds if they will share their supplies
meanwhile , six death row inmates are suing to stop imports they claim may be unsafe
