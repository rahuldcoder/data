@entity0 , @entity1 -- this presidential election tells us something unexpected about @entity7 politics			2
for all the talk about polarization and discord in @entity12 , it appears that both parties will have pragmatic problem - solvers at the top of their tickets			1
@entity17 have accepted four more years with a pragmatist			2
president @entity19 has consistently been willing to anger members of his own party by reaching out to @entity22 and often embracing their issues , such as deficit reduction			1
rather than a fighting for an ideological agenda , he has instead focused on one problem at a time and accepted the constraints that he faces			2
@entity22 are settling on former @entity31 gov. @entity30 , who has spent much of his career avoiding ideological purity			1
by all accounts , one of his virtues as a leader has been his eagerness to delve into difficult problems and his willingness to experiment when trying to find solutions			0
as everyone knows , he has shifted his positions on matters such as stem cell research and as governor he was willing to put forward an ambitious health care plan that expanded government by using a conservative idea , the individual mandate			0
some pundits will read the decision to support these candidates as continued evidence of party loyalty			1
in the case of @entity19 , there were no @entity17 who decided that they would challenge him in the primary because they wanted to avoid the kind of turmoil that occurred when sen. @entity62 ran against president @entity63 from the left in 1980			1
in the case of @entity30 , the @entity22 hatred of @entity19 is so great that the party is willing to compromise on a candidate whose politics are hard to pin down but who stands a better chance of winning in november			1
yet another way to read these decisions is that , at some level , voters are genuinely angry about the polarized status quo in @entity12			1
they are willing to support pragmatic problem - solvers because , at some level , they find it appealing to elect politicians who could overcome the deeply dysfunctional government we have			2
there is some evidence to support this claim			0
in " @entity86 ? the myth of a @entity93 , " @entity87 argued that polarization was much stronger among political elites that it was in the broader electorate			1
his examination of poll data revealed that on many controversial issues such as abortion or gay rights , most @entity7 tended to be in the middle of the political landscape			0
second , the approval ratings of @entity102 also suggest that citizens are unhappy with polarization			2
approval ratings for @entity102 are at about 12.5 % , a historic low			0
when such a large number of @entity7 indicate that they do n't approve of the institution , they are registering their complaints about the gridlock in @entity102			0
even though most @entity7 continue to vote for incumbents in their districts , they do n't like the institution as a whole			0
finally , for all the talk about polarization , when it comes to electing presidents , voters have tended to go for the people who promise to reach out across the aisle			0
in 2008 , @entity19 ran as the candidate who appealed to both sides of the political spectrum and who contrasted himself with the fierce partisanship of the @entity22 side			1
in 2000 , @entity129 ran as the compassionate conservative who was willing to use government on behalf of some causes , and in 2004 he avoided some of the more divisive issues by emphasizing national security as his unifying issue			0
in 1992 , voters went for @entity139 , a proud pragmatist who wanted to move beyond the orthodoxies of the 1960s			0
@entity139 was part of the @entity143 , a group that sought to move his party toward the center			2
@entity139 doubled down on this theme in 1996 as he leaned to the right following the @entity22 takeover of @entity102 , and he defeated sen. @entity149 by landslide			0
the emerging contest between @entity30 and @entity19 thus provides more evidence that there is still room to move beyond @entity12 's bitter partisan stalemates			1
when politicians yell and fight , they capture the attention of the television cameras but the public is not always with them			0
as this upcoming contest reveals , there is still a yearning in the electorate for a different kind of politics in @entity12			1
join us at @entity169 / @entity168 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

is @entity93 really a deeply polarized country , as some suggest ?
@entity172 says @entity19 , @entity30 have appeal to the center of the spectrum
he says the two parties are choosing not to run candidates with polarizing ideology
@entity172 : there is still a strong yearning for compromise and *moderation* in @entity12
