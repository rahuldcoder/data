-- for more than 100 days , the @entity2 area has experienced an unprecedented season of unrest			1
on august 9 , officer @entity5 shot @entity6 , an unarmed teen			2
the next day , the community gathered for prayer in the parking lot of the @entity10			2
people continued to gather as the prayer service ended			1
i hung around and listened to story after story of police abuse in @entity17 and throughout the @entity2 area			1
i have no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the stories as my own black children have had similar encounters and stories of their own			2
meanwhile , about a mile away on @entity26 , more people gathered to express grief			1
existing frustrations with the business community on @entity26 were amplified by @entity6 's death			1
passions exploded when the grievers were met with an aggressive police presence including a barking attack dog and drawn rifles			2
in utter despair and bewilderment , one person threw a rock through a window			2
as others ran from the police , anger and fear collided , resulting in a fair amount of destruction -- including the burning down of the @entity47			2
there has n't been a day like that since			2
a tale of two streets in @entity17 residents from all over @entity2 who gathered day after day on @entity26 encountered police being transported in armored trucks , standing offensively in riot gear , some officers with rifles and others with batons , none with a name tag			1
we were tear - gassed and shot with rubber bullets and wooden pellets			2
a justifiably angry community was met with a violent assault from militarized police			2
this community needed to process grief , express anger , question authorities , and gather information			2
we did n't get that			0
my friend @entity74 said , " when you treat a generation of people like they have nothing to offer , they will start fighting like they have nothing to lose			1
" in the months since @entity6 's death , this community has formed an unbreakable bond			1
many times , the community has come together for dinner during protest demonstrations			0
women have become surrogate moms			0
men have risen as protectors of the community			0
lifelong friendships have been formed			0
the white and @entity96 community has also entered the struggle			0
many white allies have told stories of feeling powerless in righting injustices they have witnessed in their communities and schools and are now empowered by a collective action			0
@entity105 have had similar experiences with police brutality and excessive force , and we stand united			1
there is within @entity2 a groundswell of residents who are fed up with unchecked power and abuse of trust and authority primarily as it pertains to law enforcement throughout this region			0
@entity121 , it is said , is the heart of @entity123			1
@entity123 's heart is broken			1
many talk about a need for reconciliation			0
personally , i think reconciliation is the wrong goal as it implies that an equitable relationship existed at some point			0
there is a long history of great division in our state -- classism and racism have impacted every issue of our lives			0
i do not believe that we need to reconnect with each other ; i believe that a new relationship paradigm must be molded			0
we are broken , and simply getting back to the way things were will not heal our brokenness			1
i have met some really good white people who are so deeply rooted within systemic racism that they do n't even realize their actions and inactions are racist behaviors and thoughts -- to them , it 's just the way things are			1
@entity6 's blood spilling out onto that street in @entity17 was symbolic of the blood that is spilling out of @entity123 's heart			1
the answer to a broken heart is not found in calling for more force			1
the heart needs healing -- healing , governor , healing ! @entity121 governor declares state of emergency our movement reminds me of @entity169 in @entity170 10:46 - 52			1
the scripture says that when @entity169 heard @entity173 was passing by , he cried out for wholeness			0
as others told him to be quiet , he cried out all the more			0
@entity169 did n't have anything to lose , and in this divine moment he decided that the possibility of being whole was worth the risk of remaining broken			1
@entity169 summoned every ounce of courage and boldness within him and the scripture says he shouted out all the more until his voice was heard -- until he got access to the wholeness he knew was possible			0
@entity169 has been crying out in @entity2 for more than 100 days and has been dealt with harshly by the use of rubber bullets , tear gas , pepper spray and wooden batons			0
yet @entity169 has cried out all the more			0
as the heart of @entity123 is made whole , lifeblood will pump through throughout this nation			1
we -- black , white , @entity96 ; across socioeconomic class ; interfaith ; clergy , politicians and other leaders ; children , young adults and elders -- have collectively determined that the possibility of being whole is worth the risk of remaining broken			1
we are not going away			0
not with tear gas , not with pepper spray , not with beatings , not with arrest			0
we will spread our cries to the furthest reaches of this city until the process of wholeness has begun			0
it is my prayer that the governor will do as @entity173 did and hear @entity169 crying out and bring healing to the heart of @entity123 .			1

the people of @entity17 are grieving , the rev. @entity221 says
@entity121 is heart of @entity123 , and @entity123 's heart is broken , she says
