@entity7 @entity2 's decision to accept a plane ride and a box seat at sunday 's @entity6 game has @entity0 considering an investigation and even some @entity10 questioning the @entity13 governor 's judgment			1
on wednesday , the co-chairman of the @entity13 legislative panel investigating the @entity17 scandal told @entity8 that he is considering an inquiry into whether it was appropriate for the governor to accept free tickets from @entity6 owner @entity21 after a company the team has a stake in was awarded a contract supported by @entity2			1
" it smacks of improper behavior			0
it smacks of hypocrisy , " assemblyman @entity28 said			0
" it smacks of inside deals that the average guy in @entity13 ca n't ever dream of having the opportunity to do			2
" @entity2 , a lifelong @entity6 fan , said through a spokesman that @entity21 paid for the ticket and transportation to the game			1
the spokesman said monday that the governor 's code of conduct allows @entity2 to accept gifts " from relatives or personal friends that are paid for with personal funds			2
" but the revelation tuesday that the @entity6 own part of a company that won a @entity51 and @entity13 contract , which was endorsed by @entity2 and @entity54 gov. @entity53 , raised questions about a possible quid - pro - quo			1
last march , @entity57 , which is owned by the @entity6 , @entity58 and the @entity59 , won the @entity51 contract to operate the observation deck of @entity62			1

@entity89 filed a complaint with the @entity93 and the governor 's @entity94 this week , arguing that " @entity2 's acceptance of gifts from @entity98 ... appears to violate at least two separate provisions of @entity13 's @entity100 , the @entity101 , and the governor 's @entity102			1
" @entity2 spokeswoman @entity104 said that it 's not surprising that a partisan organization is " using the governor 's support of a football team for a political hit			2
" " the governor does not involve himself in @entity51 bidding processes , " she said			2

and @entity21 wants him there because he 's good luck			2

" but even some @entity10 are questioning @entity2 's decision to watch the game from the owner 's box			1
former @entity137 state sen. @entity136 , who served on the @entity93 , said @entity2 was offered the tickets because of his position as governor , which " just does n't pass the smell test			0
" " i just wonder if the governor has n't given up his idea of being president			0
for him to do this , to go out to @entity119 to see this game , does n't show good judgment , " he said			0
it 's a point @entity89 , a former spokesman for the @entity150 , echoed			0
" it really defies the imagination that someone who sees himself as running for president would act this way , " he said			0
" it does n't look like someone who 's on a national stage ready for primetime			0
