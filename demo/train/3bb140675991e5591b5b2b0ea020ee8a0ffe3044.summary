-- the presence of a decomposing human body is the only plausible explanation for the odor in @entity7 's trunk and the results found in forensic testing , a scientist testified monday in her capital murder trial			1
testing was conducted on carpet samples from the trunk of the @entity23 , along with a spare tire cover , scrapings from the wheel well , air samples and paper towels found in a trash bag that had been in the trunk , @entity11 , a senior research scientist at @entity13 's @entity12 , testified in the @entity25 , @entity26 , courtroom			1
@entity11 , who spent all day monday on the stand , said he and his partners have , as part of their general research , identified some 30 compounds as significant in the human decomposition process			1
seven of those were confirmed in @entity38 's trunk , he said			0
of those , @entity11 testified under cross-examination by defense attorney @entity41 , only five were considered because the other two were at trace levels			2
" we were very , very conservative , " @entity11 said			2
prosecutor @entity44 asked @entity11 if , given the test results and his own observations regarding the odor , he believed a dead body had been in the trunk			1
" i can find no other plausible explanation , other than that , to explain all the results we found , " @entity11 said			1
@entity7 , 25 , faces seven counts in the death of her 2 - year - old daughter @entity7 , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			1
@entity7 was last reported seen by her family on june 16 , 2008 , but no one alerted police until july 15 , when the girl 's grandmother , @entity7 's mother , tracked @entity38 down and demanded answers			1
prosecutors allege @entity38 used chloroform on her daughter and suffocated her by putting duct tape over the little girl 's mouth and nose			0
they allege @entity38 put her daughter 's body in her car trunk before disposing of it			2
@entity7 's skeletal remains were found in december 2008 , less than a mile from the home of @entity38 's parents			1
@entity38 has pleaded not guilty and denied having anything to do with her daughter 's death			2
@entity41 has said that when all the facts are known , it will become clear his client is innocent			0
the @entity25 woman 's attorneys argue @entity7 drowned in the family pool on june 16 , 2008			1
they say @entity38 and her father panicked and covered up the death			0
@entity38 denied the claim during his testimony			0
earlier monday , @entity11 testified the presence of chloroform on a carpet sample from the trunk was at a " shockingly high " level -- far beyond what normally would be seen in environmental samples and higher than any he has seen in his nearly two decades of forensic study			1
" the chloroform was shockingly high , unusually high , " @entity11 said			2
the same testing done on a " control sample " of carpet from another @entity23 , found in a junkyard , also showed chloroform , but the level was much lower -- " trace amounts , " he testified			0
laser - based testing of the carpet , and testing of the other items also showed the presence of elements and substances associated with decomposition , he said			2
found in the wheel well scrapings was acetic acid , a byproduct both of decomposition and of the manufacture of chloroform , according to @entity11			1
his testimony for the state was punctuated with objections from @entity38 's defense attorneys			0
@entity11 said as a control sample , scientists were able to find a blanket that a 3 - year - old 's body was wrapped in and put into a car trunk for three months			1
" the point of that was to confirm that compounds such as we saw in the @entity26 trunk , that were consistent with human decomposition , could be formed in that type of environment , " @entity137 said			1
in that test , four of the five compounds were present , he said			0
the only one not found was chloroform			0
on cross-examination , @entity41 tried to suggest @entity11 had a financial interest in the case , which he denied , and also tried to cast doubt on the testing methods , protocols and quality control			2
he tried to get @entity11 to say the fatty acids found on the paper towels could have been from meat , but @entity11 said it would have had to be raw meat with a high fat percentage and with bacteria normally found in human bodies			1
@entity11 also told @entity41 he was aware the media had been reporting his findings before they were finalized , and was unhappy about that			2
@entity41 did get @entity11 to acknowledge he is not currently a member of any professional organizations			2
monday morning , @entity11 gave jurors in the trial a crash course in the stages of human decomposition and explained his nearly 20 years of study , some of which was done at " @entity177 , " the anthropological research facility located near the @entity13 campus			1
@entity11 said he was contacted by @entity181 sheriff 's detective @entity180 and asked to examine evidence in the @entity38 case			2
he then requested air samples from various points in @entity7 's car			1
a crime scene investigator , the operator of a towing company and members of @entity38 's family all have testified they smelled a bad odor coming from @entity38 's car after it was found abandoned in a parking lot on june 27 , 2008 , and then towed four days later			1
the prosecution maintains the odor in the car was that of human decomposition , and says cadaver dogs also alerted to it			2
@entity11 testified the odor in the air samples he received was " overwhelmingly strong			1
i was surprised that little can had so much odor associated with it			0
" he said he identified the odor as that of human decomposition			2
on saturday , @entity210 trace evidence examiner @entity208 testified that a single hair found in the trunk of @entity38 's car was similar to that of @entity7 and showed evidence of decomposition			1
the scientific testimony , which began friday , marked a departure from the dramatic testimony and evidence offered in the first nine days of the trial , in which friends and acquaintances contradicted @entity38 's claims that she was frantically searching for her daughter during the month she was missing and before authorities were notified			0
instead , @entity38 was staying with her boyfriend , spending time in @entity25 with numerous friends , attending parties , going shopping and hitting nightclubs , including participating in a " hot body " contest , according to testimony in the case			0
her former boyfriend , friends and acquaintances have all testified that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time and that they noticed nothing different about her demeanor			0
@entity245 testified saturday how a 9 - inch piece of hair found in @entity38 's car and sent to the @entity210 lab in @entity249 , @entity250 , appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from a brush belonging to @entity7			1
but she said hair analysis is not as precise as dna analysis , so she could not say with absolute certainty that the hair belonged to @entity7			2
she said she could not say how the hair got there			0
the hair had a dark band that @entity245 testified has only been seen in hairs remaining in the scalp of a decomposing body			0
she also testified under questioning from @entity41 that while the hair is clearly not @entity7 's , it could belong to any other light - haired relative on her mother 's side of the family			1
the kind of dna testing authorities were able to perform on the sample reveals @entity256 passed down only through maternal lines			0
the hair in question was recovered after @entity38 's car was picked up from her family 's home , after it had been abandoned in a parking lot , towed to an impound lot and then driven back to the family home two weeks later by @entity38 's father			0
according to testimony , @entity38 asked her boyfriend to pick her up from the parking lot on june 27 , saying the car had run out of gas			0
she also told a friend that she believed an animal carcass was lodged in her car 's frame			0
the car was towed to an impound lot on june 30 , 2008 , where a manager said he smelled the odor of decomposition			1
testing of samples from the car 's interior and a bag of garbage that had been in the trunk , showed some relevant compounds , @entity11 testified monday , but the majority were found " in high abundance " in the carpet sample			1
" we confirmed the carpet was the point source of the odor , " he said			0
before prosecutors began presenting scientific evidence in the case on friday , jurors watched recordings of jailhouse visits between @entity38 and her parents			0
in one conversation played friday , @entity38 scoffed at a media report her mother brought up speculating that @entity7 had drowned in the family swimming pool			0
" @entity330 , " @entity38 said of the rumor , which is now the primary defense theory			0
@entity38 's defense team explains her behavior in the weeks following @entity7 's death by saying she had been sexually abused by her father and had been taught to conceal her pain			1
@entity38 has denied abusing his daughter			0
