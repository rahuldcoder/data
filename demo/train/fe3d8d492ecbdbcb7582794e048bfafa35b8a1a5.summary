-- they are six of the most powerful words in the @entity4 language : " the doctor will see you now			2
" physicians themselves rarely hear them			0
but to the people who do -- the patients in the waiting room -- they can spur emotions ranging from hope to fear to gratitude to anxiety to dread			0
which is why what has happened , in recent years , as patients step into examining rooms has had such a profound effect on the experience of a visit to the doctor			1
there have been two changes , prompted by federal initiatives whose genesis predated the @entity30 , that have altered a comforting routine essential to the physician - patient relationship for centuries			1
the doctor today is not likely to look for long into the eyes of the patient			1
as the physician begins asking questions and taking a history , he or she may be tapping away at a computer keyboard , peering at the screen , entering information as the patient responds to queries			1
it can be jarring , the first time a patient encounters it			2
the importance of eye contact with a doctor does not become evident until it 's gone			0
there is a reason that physicians have shifted their eyes away from their patients and toward those screens ; it is not that the doctors have cavalierly decided to become rude			0
the mandated use of electronic medical records , with the government providing cash incentives for physicians who agree to use them , and threats of eventual penalties for those who do n't , has forced doctors , many of them reluctantly , to become data - entry clerks as they conduct their examinations			1
this matters , and not in a good way			0
there is something about the presumed intimacy of a conversation with one 's doctor -- of patient and physician looking into each others ' eyes , with the physician reading the expression on the patient 's face as well as listening to the patient 's words -- that is key to what medical care , with the emphasis on " care , " has always been about			1
part of this may be mutually understood illusion ; on some level the patient is aware that the doctor probably has a half - dozen patients , right at this moment , in examining rooms up and down the hallway , waiting for his or her attention			1
but the time that one spends with the doctor is supposed to feel like a heart - to - heart conversation , one human being talking about exceedingly private things to another			1
the patient has made plans for this visit , has traveled to it , has come prepared with a list of concerns and worries			1
when the doctor , obedient to 21st - century regulations , turns away and begins to communicate not with the patient but with a screen , something intangible and consequential is lost			1
is the doctor really seeing you now ? the changes have been instituted in the name of efficiency : " evidence - based decision support , " " quality management , " " streamlining the clinician 's workflow , " among other jargon used to justify the decreed new methods			1
electronic records can make coordination between a patient 's various physicians more seamless , can provide information about a patient 's history quickly in emergencies , can be helpful in ascertaining that treatment options being considered in different offices do not duplicate or conflict with each other			1
and , without question , as the world moves from records kept on paper to digital storage , revisions in the workings of doctors ' offices were necessary			2
yet as medical organizations , insurance companies and the federal government all make their cases for what works best , the one constituency -- such a cold word -- that seems to be left out is the patients			0
some of whom have always felt a little awkward raising questions about what goes on in their physicians ' offices			0
it is not easy , in that examining room , for a woman or a man to say to the doctor : " could you please look at me when we talk ? " some doctors -- the ones who can afford it -- have come up with what seems to be a solution to the new regulations			2
@entity180 , sometimes referred to as scribes , have been retained to move with the doctor from one examining room to the next , carrying laptop computers or tablets , listening as the doctor and patient speak , typing the requisite information			2
this allows the doctor to talk with the patient the old way : eye - to - eye			1
but it creates a different problem			0
there is a stranger in the room			0
for some , perhaps many , patients , the kinds of things they want to discuss with their longtime doctor are not the kinds of things they want to say in front of third parties			0
that illusion of intimacy , again , that feeling of privacy -- it becomes broken			0
the elderly patient who may have been going to the same doctor for decades , now being expected to sit , undressed , in the presence not just of that trusted doctor , but of a transcriptionist listening in and clicking keys ... something is lost			2
the best and most compassionate doctors can make anything work			0
they do it every day			0
but the bureaucrats , however well - intentioned , who came up with these changes may have lost sight of another time - honored phrase in the healing arts , the most sacrosanct of all			0
it refers to the general practice of medicine , but it also applies to the doctor - patient relationship : first , do no harm			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			2

@entity235 : doctors taking notes on computer *interferes* with doctor - patient visit
he says electronic records mandate may keep them from *assessing* patient visually
he says visits are *precious* *opportunities* for face - to - face discussion
@entity235 : doctors must find a way to solve this for the sake of doctor - patient relationship
