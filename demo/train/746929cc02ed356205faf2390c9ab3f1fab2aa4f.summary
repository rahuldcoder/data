-- everybody has a " type			1
" personally , i like a man with a big schnozz -- bonus points if he 's got a collection of acne scars a lá @entity10			1
the " @entity15 " is one of the nine types of men that women should avoid			1
my pal @entity16 likes preppy men -- but only after they 've gone to seed and become a little bloated in the process			1
@entity19 has a weakness for thin @entity22 guys who like indie rock music , while @entity24 adores bike messengers of all shapes and sizes			2
but there are certain types of guys who should be nobody 's type			1
these guys are distinguished by one thing -- an overabundance of one or more very bad qualities			2
here 's your guide to boys to avoid : 1			2
the @entity38 : the current @entity39 is @entity40 , who wrote a highly hide - chapping account of his extramarital affair for @entity43			0
the @entity44 will broadcast intimate episodes from your relationship to his mother , your mother , his blog readers and anyone else he can rope into paying attention			0
the @entity53 : one of the great things about dating men is that you are n't subjected to long , excruciating interrogations over what you really meant when you reassured him that no , he did n't look fat in those pants			2
however , though they 're rare birds , there are guys who will want to spend hours dissecting even the most innocuous comment , examining it for tone , content and what you might 've been implying			0
the @entity71 : your friends say they 've never known you to be so quiet			1
that 's because this man does enough talking for both of you ( and then some )			1
when you do finally eke out a sentence or two he interrupts and talks over you anyway			0
you have two choices -- accept the fact that you will never speak again or tell him goodbye			2
the @entity83 : this dandy makes @entity86 's @entity85 look sloppy and mismatched			1
that he takes longer than you to get ready is strike one against him , but the fact that he matches his socks to his underwear and to his ascot drives him out of the park			0
the @entity15 : it 's an irritating fact that men can eat more than women			1
the overeater does n't care			0
food is his first love and he 'll push cannolis and baked ziti on you like a crazed @entity106 granny			0
unless you do n't mind a future spent in stretch - pants , you might want to give this dude a pass			0
the @entity112 : remember when @entity113 threw a phone at that hotel clerk who somehow displeased him ? that 's this guy			1
from the old lady who accidentally bumped into him at the grocery store , to the suv that cut him off on the highway -- everyone in his path will hear his wrath			1
you , most of all			0
do not walk away -- run			1
the @entity128 : he 's the life of the party and thinks nothing of driving his motorcycle through the bar if he thinks it 'll get a laugh			2
he 's certainly cute , but he just never stops			2
and that , will quickly turn into a turn - off			0
@entity140 : picture the male version of @entity142 in the movie " election " in perfectly fitted jeans , a crisp white oxford shirt and a copy of his ( perfect , naturally ) sat scores in his wallet			0
now imagine making love to him			0
you ca n't , can you ? 9			0
the @entity154 : maybe he was the homeliest kid in his eighth - grade class , but that does n't mean you need to sit through a monologue about how much money he makes , how jealous his friends are over his new @entity162 , and how he totally could date supermodels if he wanted to			1
next ! @entity164 all rights reserved			0
