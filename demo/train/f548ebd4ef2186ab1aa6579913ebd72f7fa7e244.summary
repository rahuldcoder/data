-- it is disheartening and alarming to learn that as many as 7,000 patients are at risk of serious , life - threatening infections because of dentist @entity6 's alleged failure to follow " standard infection control guidelines " at his practice in a @entity9 , @entity10 , suburb			1
around the country , people are asking : are @entity15 oral health services safe ? the short answer is : yes			0
but , patients should always check to make sure that their dental provider adheres to the strictest safety guidelines			2
the allegations leveled against @entity6 are deeply troubling , and it is terrible that his many patients must now worry they might have been exposed to hepatitis and @entity24 because of his alleged failure to implement even the most basic infection control guidelines			1
as the leader of his oral health care team , it was his responsibility to ensure the safety of the patients who trusted him with their care			2
dental patients tested for hepatitis , @entity24 exposure considering that there are 175,000 practicing dentists in the @entity15 , it would be easy to argue that @entity6 is an outlier and statistically insignificant			1
however , one outlier is one too many , and the lives he might have put at risk are anything but insignificant			0
but generally , dental care in the @entity15 is among the best in the world			1
along with the privilege and tremendous rewards of being a health care professional comes the awesome responsibility of providing the highest quality of care possible			2
dental practices , as with any medical practice , must make sure that safety is a priority			0
as we approach the graduation season , dental schools in the @entity15 will welcome more than 4,000 new colleagues to our profession			1
all schools are held to the standards promulgated by the @entity66 on @entity67 that address patient safety			0
training in and implementation of patient safety protocols is an important component of any dental school education			0
upon graduation , the dental education community certifies that new dentists are competent to independently provide oral health care			1
they should be able to put into practice the knowledge , skills and experiences they have gained			0
the very basics of infection control are not complicated to understand or implement			1
the @entity84 has issued a very clear and practical document that most practitioners utilize to develop protocols in their practices			0
in addition , the @entity89 is a wonderful resource for information and training			0
all states require that licensed dentists participate in continuing education to maintain that license to practice			0
many states , such as @entity99 , require a portion of this continuing education to be focused on infection control			1
dental schools , organized groups such as the @entity103 , licensing boards and other dental organizations have made patient safety a priority during the past 25 years			2
in the array of health care providers , dentists have an admirable record of providing high - quality care in a safe environment			1
patients should feel confident that their care will be provided in a safe environment and that there is infinitesimal risk of transmission of disease			2
however , as one seeks any health care services , patients must ask questions about the provider , his or her staff , facility , training and compliance with infection control guidelines			1
any capable and qualified dentist would welcome such questions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			0

@entity137 : despite this case , dental care in the @entity15 is among the best in the world
he says dental community and schools put *emphasis* on infection control and safety
