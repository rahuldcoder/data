@entity0 , @entity1 -- anyone who visits @entity0 would be struck by the resilience of its people , many of whom lost everything -- family , friends , homes -- when @entity13 battered the central @entity1 a year ago			1
but imagine if you were them for a moment : you 're told another storm , almost as powerful , is now heading for you			2
it 's a horrifying prospect			1
interactive : see the latest satellite and path of the storm this is a population used to frequent tropical storms and that was one of the problems in november 2013			1
so many people thought they could ride out the storm but did n't account for the deadly floodwaters from the storm surge that followed			1
and what followed has been well documented -- entire communities flattened and decomposing bodies strewn along the side of roads			0
a death toll that eventually exceeded 5,000 of this country 's most impoverished souls			2
nearly everyone here lost someone			0
barely 12 months later and the people of @entity0 , a name that will be forever associated with this disaster , have only started to recover , with many schools and homes rebuilt , businesses reopened and the scars of lost relatives and friends beginning to heal			1
the current storm in question -- @entity53 -- may not yet hit @entity0 , such is the chilling unpredictability of these weather systems , but the prospect of another massive storm so soon after @entity13 is enough to alarm people here			1
and that has spurred many to act			0
" i heard about the new storm on television , " @entity60 , a young mother , told @entity2 from outside her modest home on the edge of a dirt road into @entity0			1
" it scared me , i remembered last year , " she added			2
as she cradled her weeks - old son , she told us that her family would be evacuating and spending the next couple of nights in a hotel			0
" we have to hide somewhere to be safe			0
" last year , she said they did n't understand the dangers of a storm surge because the government had n't warned them			1
@entity60 's home was completely destroyed by @entity13			1
her new one -- little more than a rickety wooden shack -- took six months to complete , and only after they managed to get financial assistance from one of the many ngos and foundations active in the region			0
while the safety of her family was the priority , she appeared resigned to losing her second home			0
all they can do is tie down the corrugated iron roof			0
asked whether she 'd consider leaving @entity0 for good , her sister , @entity91 , interjected : " no , this is where we grew up			2
we 've been living here for almost 30 years , so it 's hard for us to leave somewhere and start a new life			2
" unfortunately , many of the homes of @entity0 's poorest rebuilt in the wake of @entity13 are little more than shanty - like structures located in areas extremely vulnerable to flooding and storm surges			1
the local government initially tried to ban them from these areas , but they eventually relented , such was the pressure to build new homes in the wake of @entity13			2
at one school on the outskirts of @entity0 , hundreds of families sought shelter in a school , setting up makeshift camps along corridors outside classrooms labeled " science lab " or " @entity120 , " and inside a massive sports hall			1
this is one of more than 60 evacuation centers dotted around the area			0
as we walked into the sports hall , we were greeted by hundreds of smiling faces -- mainly children , who clearly viewed this as an adventure			2
one middle - aged woman told us she 'd brought all 13 of her children along with her			0
another young mother said her husband insisted they leave their home despite the threat of losing their possessions to opportunist looters			0
she said memories of the @entity13 prompted them to look for somewhere safe to shelter			1
as we moved towards the @entity146 neighborhood , one of the worst - hit areas of @entity0 last year , the scars of @entity13 were evident , a single palm tree stood defiantly on the beach alongside a group of wrecked wooden shacks -- once the homes of entire families			1
this is a particularly poor neighborhood that sits along the water 's edge			2
many residents like @entity160 , 40 , have opted to evacuate too , though the police reportedly have orders to arrest anyone who ignores compulsory evacuation orders for this area anyway			0
with the incongruous sight of a young boy surfing in the background , @entity160 told us he and his family were inside when the waves started to lash their home during last year 's storm surge			1
" we were lucky , because the water made a hole in our wall that created a pocket for the water to pass through and not collapse it , " he said			0
" we managed to get to the second floor -- if it was n't for that hole , it would have collapsed and we 'd have been swept away			0
" and now we pray that this new storm just disappears			0
" while there 's a very real fear that last year could happen again , the situation in @entity0 is calm			1
the police and military are deployed here alongside an impressive number of foreign @entity188 and even soldiers from @entity191 's military			1
the feared run on supplies does n't seem to have materialized -- yet			0
while some businesses have boarded up and closed , others , including gas stations , do n't have long queues of people anxious to stock up .			0

year after @entity13 , people of @entity0 are again *braced* for a tropical storm
prospect of another massive storm so soon after @entity13 is enough to alarm people
at school near @entity0 , hundreds of families seek shelter in a school
police , military deployed with large number of foreign @entity188 , soldiers from @entity191 's military
