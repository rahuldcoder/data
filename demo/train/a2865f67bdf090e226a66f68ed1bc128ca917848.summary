watch your step as you climb these stairs , whether spiraling up mountains , narrow passageways or sky - scraping attractions			1
all is right with the world when you 're gazing down from the rooftop of @entity9 's @entity8			1
that is , until you remember the steep marble stairs that got you there — and are your only way down			0
stairways can leave just as much of an impact on your memory as the places they lead you			0
some are so eye - catching they look like they belong in an @entity21 painting , while other stairs are downright intimidating , especially when they stand between you and a site you flew halfway across the world to experience			1
in @entity28 , for instance , travelers need to tackle about 600 feet of slippery granite rocks carved into the mountainside to reach the @entity31 at @entity32			1
and at @entity33 , you ca n't take a selfie at the top of @entity36 without climbing a cable ladder up the rock face for more than 400 feet			1
all it takes is a misstep for any old staircase to become treacherous ( just ask @entity42 ) , yet some standout for being especially scary			1
a set of stairs in @entity46 is so precariously perched that climbing is now illegal			0
in @entity49 , there 's a stairway with an age requirement			1
other stairs are intimidating for more psychological reasons , such as the creaking noises made by the world 's longest wooden stairway in @entity57 or the eerie atmosphere at " the @entity59 to @entity60 , " part of an abandoned industrial complex in @entity63			1
travelers with nerves of steel — and eager for bragging rights — follow these stairs because of what they find at the end , whether a sacred @entity71 or the top of a spectacular waterfall			0
there 's nothing quite like the thrill of accomplishment that comes once you 've taken that last step			1
@entity81 , @entity82 in this super-humid hotbox of @entity86 history , there 's no shame in bowing down on your hands and knees or pulling yourself up with the provided ropes to scale the nearly 70 percent inclined stairs of @entity81 's uppermost temples			1
guides claim the steps were made to be so steep to remind people that heaven was hard to reach — though you might make the same argument about @entity100 as you try not to tumble on the way down			1
the @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 it takes guts just to reach the starting point of the world 's tallest and fastest water slide , opened july 2014			1
to get to the top , you 've got to climb the 264 steps that snake up the slide 's tower in 25 turns			1
when you 've summited at 168 feet — that 's one foot taller than @entity116 — pat yourself on the back and take a selfie			1
then brace yourself for the water slide 's initial 50 - foot linear drop , which can reach 65 mph			1
the only alternative is to turn around and suffer the 17 - story walk back down those nauseating steps			1
@entity123 , @entity124 at first it 's lovely to notice that the staircase adjacent to these waterfalls was designed to blend in with the tropical landscape			2
but consider the name — in @entity130 , the @entity132 's @entity131 — and the evil tricks the steep steps can play			1
they are made of smooth , oversize pebbles that provide little traction , and when you 're looking down , they blend together , creating an optical illusion of a stone slide			0
they 're also slippery from the constant mist from the falls and even though there 's a metal railing to save you from any spills — but do n't count on that too much — it too is drenched with water droplets			1
@entity36 , @entity149 , @entity150 what 's between you and the most iconic peak in @entity153 ? a seven - mile ( one - way ) all - incline hike through the wilderness that culminates with climbing up the rock face along a cable ladder for more than 400 vertical feet			1
if you 're up for the challenge , snag one of the 300 hard - to - get daily permits available for @entity36 between @entity164 and mid-october			1
( check your footwear and the forecast ; rainy conditions have proven fatal			0
) from the summit , you 'll take in panoramic views of @entity153 and the @entity170			0
@entity171 : @entity100 's coolest playgrounds @entity173 , @entity28 at @entity32 , 600 feet or so of steep , slippery , cloud - covered granite rocks the @entity173 carved more than 500 years ago into the side of @entity176 ( the peak in everyone 's photos ) lead to the rarely visited @entity180 — and a spectacular view of the ruins			1
the park limits the climb to the first 400 visitors each morning and has added some metallic chains in the worst parts , so hold on because on one side is a sheer , damp wall and on the other , a straight drop into the @entity192			0
@entity193 , @entity194 if you want to gaze out from @entity193 's crown , check your claustrophobia at her feet			2
the platform 's only access is via a cramped , 146 - step double - helix spiral staircase with just six feet of head clearance — and it 's teeming with tourists			1
real troopers , however , will make the entire tight 377 - step hike up all the way from the lobby , the equivalent of climbing a 20 - story building			2
these physical challenges all come after you 've managed another feat : snagging one of the hard to get passes that allow entry into the crown			0
they have to be booked at least three months in advance , are name and date specific and are limited to four per order			0
@entity221 , @entity57 @entity57 's @entity222 is the starting point for the best hikes around the town of @entity226 — and its stairs will make you gasp for two reasons			2
first , there are 4,444 steps that ascend a staggering 2,427 feet from the bottom			2
second , it is the longest staircase in the world made entirely out of wood , meaning you should be paying close attention to each mysterious creak and crack you hear			0
@entity238 , @entity49 there 's no official count of steps on this cardiac stress test carved into a sacred @entity244 mountain			1
perhaps because anyone attempting to conquer this vertiginous washboard wall has lost count , distracted by the dizzying drop and its threat of death			0
eventually , the steep " heavenly stairs " stop , and this becomes the most hellish horizontal walk in the world — a three - plank - wide walkway with only a chain to hold onto , flush against the wall of flat rock			2
when that 's done , there 's another set of meandering , mountainside stairs			2
if you get to the top of @entity238 , you 'll discover that " heaven " is a remote tea house with a terrific view			0
@entity171 : @entity100 's scariest bridges @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 the steps are short and sweet			1
they 're not cramped , they come with railings , and they do n't get too crowded			0
what can make these stairs squeamish is their placement at the summit of the tallest mountain in the @entity283 , when they 're open to the elements — gale - force winds and chilly temperatures			2
@entity288 , @entity289 one of the most important @entity291 holy sites outside of @entity292 is this series of cave shrines nestled into the side of a mountain about eight miles from @entity297			0
the highlight : accomplishing the ascent of 272 steps that lead 330 feet up the rock to the main @entity302			2
it 's not just the stone stairs that test your temerity ; it 's the sneaky macaque monkeys			2
they are n't afraid of people and are liable to steal stuff right out of your bag			0
so while it 's a good idea to climb without any food , it also ca n't hurt to say a prayer before going up			2
you may do so at the temple of @entity318 — the " noble monkey " — to the far left of the entrance , near @entity320			0
@entity322 , @entity323 @entity324 envisioned a forest canopy when designing the rooftop of this @entity327 , but climbing the spiral staircase to its towers feels more like crawling up a @entity330			0
not only does it coil high along the tightly enclosed walls , but there 's also no banister to prevent you from barreling over the middling edge while you 're walking up and down with hordes of other people			2
@entity339 , @entity340 , @entity46 can stairs be so seriously scary that they 've been banned ? answer : yes			0
the 3,922 rickety steps that lead a half mile up @entity340 's @entity344 pose such a risk , it 's actually illegal to climb them			1
there 's even a guard placed at the bottom to stop you from going up			2
nicknamed the @entity352 , they were built in 1942 by the @entity353 as a means to installing communications wires			0
after @entity357 , they became popular with daredevil hikers			0
but by 1987 , they had closed to the public for safety concerns , and they stay that way , despite a 2003 renovation project			0
@entity8 , @entity9 no visit to @entity9 is complete without having marveled at the view of @entity368 's northern city from the roof of this famed cathedral stacked with about 2,000 statues			0
but in order to check it off your bucket list , you 're required to wiggle up and down a steep , slender staircase in a shaft way clogged with tourists			0
tip : @entity379 to @entity380 , a department store across the street with a rooftop café that serves up perfect views of the cathedral and skyline — no stairs necessary			0

@entity31 at @entity32 can be reached by 600 - foot slippery granite steps
the journey to @entity33 's @entity36 requires a long cable ladder
a misstep on any of these staircases can be lethal
