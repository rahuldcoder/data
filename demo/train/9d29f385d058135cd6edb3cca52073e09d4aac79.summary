@entity8 -- " when dr. @entity1 defined patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel , he was unconscious of the then undeveloped capabilities of the word ' reform			2
' " so quipped @entity11 sen. @entity10 of @entity12 130 years ago			1
the particular reform that irked @entity10 was the then - novel proposal to eliminate patronage in federal civil service hiring			2
@entity10 lost his argument and lost his battle , but his quip endures -- and applies much more aptly to today 's most discussed " reform " : immigration reform			1
" immigration reform " is a deliberately ambiguous phrase , a phrase used equally by opposite sides in the immigration debate			1
those who want amnesty for illegal immigrants call themselves " reformers			2
" so do those who want stricter enforcement of the laws against illegal immigration			2
but there 's a third group to be heard , and these are the people who validate @entity10 's cynical remark : the group of " reformers " who want to expand and enlarge guest worker programs			2
the @entity11 is entering its sixth year of extraordinarily high unemployment			1
twelve million @entity11 who want work can not find it			1
millions more have quit searching			0
slack labor markets have depressed wages throughout the economy			1
here 's the picture that 's worth a thousand words , from an economic commentary by @entity53 and @entity54 for the @entity55 of @entity56			2
whichever of the two competing data series you use , wages account for a substantially lower share of national income today than at any point since @entity62 , when record - keeping began			1
yet even these dismal findings understate the problem			0
remember , " labor income " includes all salary income , including the salaries of the most highly paid , the famous 1 % , who have enjoyed the benefit of almost all productivity gains since the 1990s			2
the wage situation of the typical worker looks even worse than the chart implies			0
whatever else you say about the @entity11 economy of the 21st century , it can not be described as suffering from labor shortages			1
yet however little workers earn , there is always somebody who wishes they earned even less			0
and for those somebodies , the solution is : import more cheap labor			1
but not just any cheap labor -- cheap labor that can not quit , that can not accept a better offer , that can not complain			1
bonded labor is the oldest idea in @entity11 labor markets			1
in the 17th and 18th centuries , about half the @entity95 migrants to the @entity11 arrived as indentured servants , people who agreed to work for a term of years in exchange for food , lodging , and the cost of their passage			1
perhaps you assumed that such arrangements had expired centuries ago ? think again			0
the march 8 @entity108 tells the story of 14 foreign students who entered the @entity11 on " @entity115 " class visas , which allow three months of work to support student study and travel			1
" ' since i got to the @entity11 , i have been working just to pay to live in a basement , ' says mr. @entity118 , who arrived in mid-december and shares the one - room space with five other foreigners who work at the same outlet			1
he said he worked about 25 hours a week earning $ 7.25 an hour and mr. @entity122 , his boss , deducted weekly rent of $ 75 from his pay			0
... @entity125 , a 23 - year - old student from @entity126 , said a curtain separated the men 's and women 's beds in the tiny basement she shared with seven other students in a house owned by mr. @entity122 's son			2
earning about $ 250 a week , she calculates she is in the red after paying for housing and food			0
to travel after completing her assignment at @entity139 , which ends this weekend , she has asked relatives to wire her money			0
" stories like this are often told about the j - 1 visa program , which brought about 109,000 students to the @entity11 in 2011			1
the @entity146 reported on the program last year : " in august 2011 , dozens of workers protested conditions at a candy factory that contracts to pack @entity152 chocolates in @entity152 , @entity153 , complaining of hard physical labor and pay deductions for rent that often left them with little money			2
then in december , a federal indictment accused the mafia of using the cultural exchange program to bring @entity163 women to work in @entity12 strip clubs			0
" j - 1 visa workers have told investigators that deductions for rent and food reduce their earnings to zero			0
they have described sexual abuse and exploitation			0
the @entity172 has proposed some changes to the program , but -- well , let @entity176 's @entity175 tell the rest of the story			2
" many seafood processors in @entity176 rely on foreign students to fill their seasonal employment needs			0
now there is uncertainty in the industry because of proposed changes to the foreign worker visa program			0
these changes could take effect as soon as this spring			0
" the federal government wants to remove some jobs offered to foreign students who want to work in the @entity11 on a @entity192			1
they include jobs in factories and manufacturing , a potential change that could hit @entity176 's seafood processors hard			2
" in a letter senator @entity200 wrote to secretary of state @entity202 last month , he says ' such an abrupt change in the available labor pool just before the start of the salmon season would have immediate negative consequences for the companies , and the fishermen and communities , which depend on their operations , ' " @entity175 reported			0
you might wonder : are there really no @entity11 who could do these jobs ? the unemployment rate for @entity176 16 - 24 years old was over 15 % in 2011			1
might n't they want the work ? yes , they might			0
but the wage for lawful @entity11 labor in the seafood - processing industry averages over $ 10 an hour			1
employers can cut their wage costs by almost 25 % by using j - 1 labor instead , according to one union - backed think tank			1
and j - 1 labor is not only cheaper , but also often more motivated			0
" the j - 1 student workers have been a godsend for @entity231 , co-owner of @entity232 , " reported @entity234 's " @entity233			0
" " ' they 're educated , they 're bright , and they 're working really hard , long hours , ' @entity231 said			0
@entity176 fish processors started hiring @entity115 - 1 students in the 1990s when unemployment was low and they could n't find @entity11 workers			1
the @entity115 - 1â € ²s are not just hard workers , @entity231 said ; they 're also really interesting			0
" ' we had a young man come through who was studying nuclear physics			0
and we were talking , and he loved the beauty of nuclear physics			0
he was passionate and he was explaining it to me , in his limited @entity250 and doing very well			0
and he was going to be going out to gut fish			0
i think that 's pretty fantastic ! ' " the immigration debate is often premised on the assumption that high wages for @entity11 workers are a problem to be overcome			1
if you 'll look again at the @entity259 chart above , you 'll notice that the collapse in labor 's share of national income coincides with the start of the mass immigration influx after 1970			1
since then 40 million people have migrated to the @entity11 , most of them very low - skilled			1
about one - third that number arrived illegally			0
immigration advocates insist that this huge surge of cheap labor has nothing to do with the persistent decline in wages that began about the same time			1
if so , that 's one hell of a coincidence			0
with president @entity278 proposing accelerated flows of immigration in future , @entity11 workers should ready themselves for more coincidences ahead			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity285 .			2

@entity285 : immigration " reform " is a deliberately ambiguous phrase
for some employers , immigrants represent a *source* of cheap labor , he says
@entity297 : big wave of immigration coincides with decline in labor 's share of economy
@entity11 does n't have a labor shortage , but wages may be too low , he says
