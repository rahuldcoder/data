-- most people are yet to learn about the progress most countries have made in recent decades			1
the reason media and schools have failed to communicate a fact - based world view is probably due to the continuous use of the outdated concept of a " @entity10			2
" a mindset upgrade with a division of countries into more than two groups is long overdue			1
in the 1960s it was very relevant to divide the countries of the world into two distinct groups			1
these two groups of countries were labeled " developed " and " developing , " or the two were just referred to as " the @entity22 " and " the @entity10 "			1
the two groups of countries differed in almost every way			2
western countries were rich and people had long education , long lives and small families			1
developing countries were poor and the people had meager or no education , short lives and large families			1
the population in the @entity22 was stable whereas the population in the developing world was growing fast			1
almost the whole world economy was in the @entity22			2
the poor developing countries were expected to gradually get out of misery with the help of development aid and family planning			1
and no major countries were found in the middle -- in the wide gap between the @entity22 and the rest			1
the only exceptions were a few small island nation states like @entity49 , @entity50 and also @entity51			0
well there was of course a third group , the @entity52 dominated " @entity58 " ; but they lived separate and enclosed lives outside the world economy			0
they were , however , included in one alternative division of countries , in which the @entity22 was called the @entity62 , the communist the @entity64 and the rest of the countries the @entity67			1
read more : take @entity69 's ' ignorance test ' and see how up - to - date your knowledge is more than two decades after the disappearance of the @entity52 group , we are in urgent need of a new system to group and label countries			0
two groups are not enough			0
the @entity80 did a promising attempt by creating four country groups by using cut - offs in @entity84 per capita at $ 1,000 , $ 4,000 and $ 12,000			0
the cut - offs defined low - income , lower middle income , upper middle income and high income countries			1
however , this division into four groups did not change many mindsets			0
the concept of a developing world ranging from @entity95 and @entity96 all the way to @entity98 and @entity99 still forms the mindset used by most people to sort information about the world			1
the world keeps changing , while mindsets remain surprisingly intact			1
now the countries of the world defy all attempts to sort in only two groups			2
most of the formerly " developing " countries fill the once empty middle , and form socioeconomic and demographic continuum			1
on the top of the health and wealth league , @entity116 and @entity49 , at the bottom the poorest nations torn by civil war , like @entity120 and @entity98			0
so the disparity between the richest and the poorest is as wide as ever , yet the big change is that the gap in the middle has been filled			0
most countries and most people now live in the middle of the new socioeconomic continuum , in middle - income countries like @entity96 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity95 and @entity132			2
half of the world 's economy -- and most of the economic growth -- now lies in these middle income countries , outside the old @entity22 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
future population growth in spite of dramatic economic shifts , the change in demography is even more pronounced			0
fifty years ago the women in the world on average had five babies , an average composed by six in the developing world and 2.5 in the developed world			1
now the world average has dropped to 2.5 babies born per woman , an unprecedented shift			2
this has happened across religions and cultures , and especially in @entity159 the fall in fertility took place at a lower economic level than ever before in human history			0
in most @entity167 countries the fertility drop happened before the economic growth took off			0
in the world as a whole the main reason for future population growth is that the young generations grow up causing an inevitable fill - up of the adult population			0
in the last decade the total number of children aged 0 - 14 in the world has started to level off at around two billion			0
the @entity181 population experts predict that it most probably is going to stay that way throughout this century			0
age of ' @entity185 ' that 's right : the amount of children in the world today is probably the most there will be ! we are entering into the age of @entity185 ! this is in spite of the increase of the number of children in @entity198 , where women in many countries still have five babies and are in desperate need of access to contraceptives			2
yet the increase of children in @entity198 is foreseen to match the decrease in the number of children in @entity159 and @entity138			2
a decrease caused by women in more and more countries having on average less than two babies			0
so almost 80 % of mankind now lives in societies where the two child families are most common and 80 % of adults in the world can read and write , and 80 % of the one - year - olds have been vaccinated and the life expectancy of the world population as a whole is 70 years			1
the percentage living in extreme poverty fell to half in the last 20 years , from 40 % to 20 %			0
so yet in this new and better world 1 - 2 billion still live in extreme poverty , can not send all children to primary school , and are not sure to have enough food to eat			0
they live in rural areas in low income and lower middle income countries			2
that means mainly in countries in @entity198 and @entity159 with less than $ 4000 in @entity84 per capita			0
so in short , the world is better than ever , yet very far from good ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1

in the 1960s , the world was divided into " developed -- or @entity138 " and " developing "
@entity238 says the division was relevant in terms of wealth , education and life expectancy
but he says since then , there has been a shift -- with most countries in the middle
the old mindset has not kept up with the new reality and needs changing , @entity238 says
