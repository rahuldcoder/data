a food - delivery website is parting ways with @entity2 in a snarky " breakup " letter			1
and @entity2 , like spurned lovers through the ages , is telling the cheeky startup not to let the door hit it on the way out			1
@entity10 , based in @entity11 , @entity12 , lets users enter their address to find restaurants that will deliver to them			1
they then select a restaurant and order online			2
the site has more than 70,000 " likes " on @entity2			1
but last week , it announced it just was n't that into the social media giant anymore			0
look , we need to talk , " read a post on the @entity10 blog			1
" this is n't easy to say since we 've been together so long , but we need to break up			0
we 'd love to say ' it 's not you , it 's us ' but it 's totally you			2
not to be rude , but you are n't the smart , funny social network we fell in love with several years back			2
" the problem ? @entity10 says @entity2 's algorithm that decides which posts users see in their feeds is unfair and rewards page owners who pay to have their posts promoted			1
" it makes us think all you care about is money , " the letter reads			0
" why should we have to wade through a dozen promoted posts about how to lose belly fat ( are you trying to tell us something ? ) and requests for @entity50 ( no ! just no. ) and suggesting we like our arch nemesis ' page ( seriously , @entity52 ) before we can finally find the perfect @entity54 meme ? it really seems like you 've lost your way and have become nothing more than an ad platform			2
" the letter says @entity10 will delete its page at midnight monday			1
in an uncharacteristically direct response , @entity61 , @entity2 's communications director , replied to the post in which the company shared the letter -- perhaps ironically -- on @entity2			1
" i was bummed to read your letter , " he wrote			0
" the world is so much more complicated than when we first met -- it has changed			0
and we used to love your jokes about tacquitos and 420 but now they do n't seem so funny			0
" the irreverent 5 - year - old site , which has bragged about its decision to advertise on porn websites and joked about its tv ads that ( allegedly accidentally ) showed a bear 's penis , mostly posted web memes and pictures of food on its @entity2 page			1
and the " breakup letter " included a joke about making a decision because " it was 4:20 at the time			0
" that 's a reference to a term that 's become code for the best time to smoke marijuana			2
@entity2 has defended its algorithm , which features some posts prominently while downplaying others			1
while many users say they want to see every post from their friends and all the pages they 've liked , @entity2 argues that would create an overwhelming flood of lower - quality content			1
in his response to @entity10 , @entity2 's @entity100 did n't address the promoted - post issue but suggested users prefer to see news from friends over companies ' marketing pitches			1
" there is some serious stuff happening in the world and one of my best friends just had a baby and another one just took the best photo of his homemade cupcakes and what we have come to realize is people care about those things more than sushi porn , " @entity100 said			0
" so we are sorry that we have to part this way because we think we could still be friends -- really we do			0
but we totally respect you if you need some space			0
" @entity2 appears to have made a concerted effort to limit how much content users see from companies ' pages			1
a recent study found that companies ' posts reached 6 % of their followers in february , down from 12 % in october			2
" like many mediums , if businesses want to make sure that people see their content , the best strategy is , and always has been , paid advertising , " a spokeswoman told @entity135			1
in its letter , @entity10 , which is available exclusively in the @entity142 , says it previously paid @entity2 to promote some of its posts and saw its follower count swell with users from other countries			1
it said the company plans to continue its social media activities on other sites and apps			0
" not to hit below the belt , but we have a lot more fun when we hang out with @entity156 and @entity157 , " the letter reads			0
" they do n't have weird algorithms , which means all of our besties get to see everything we post			0
" @entity157 , of course , has been owned by @entity2 since 2012			2
ironically , @entity10 's breakup letter appears to be , far and away , its most popular post on the site			1
as of monday morning , it had more than 2,200 " likes " and had been shared nearly 1,000 times			0
its other most recent posts ranged in " likes " from a dozen or so up to about 180			2
most of the comments were supportive , even when some fans sensed an ulterior motive			0
" i know this is a pr stunt , but this is my favorite pr stunt , " one user wrote			0
" as always -- brilliant , guys			0
" the company 's reply : " no comment , except thank you			2
