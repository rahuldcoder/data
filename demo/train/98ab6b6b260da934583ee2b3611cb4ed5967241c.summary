-- it has long been the final destination for terminally ill patients who want to end their lives , offering what many consider to be a dignified way out of their suffering			0
but now , @entity8 is proposing legislation that would limit the practice of assisted suicide to people who are terminally ill -- or ban it altogether			1
if either proposal is adopted , people suffering from a chronic illness or who have a mental illness could no longer legally take advantage of assisted suicide			1
the @entity20 says it does n't necessarily want to end the country 's liberal laws , which allow someone to assist a suicide as long as they are not motivated by their own interests			2
but the council says organizations that provide assisted suicide in @entity8 -- such as the well known @entity31 clinic -- are increasingly testing the boundaries of the law , requiring the government to lay out specific guidelines and restrictions			1
recent cases have drawn more attention to " suicide tourism , " in which people who ca n't legally seek assisted suicide in their home countries travel to @entity8 , where it is allowed			1
@entity44 , a 23 - year - old @entity45 rugby player , ended his life at a @entity8 assisted suicide clinic last year			1
he had been paralyzed from the neck down in a rugby accident			0
his illness was chronic but not terminal			0
@entity44 ' case drew headlines when his parents , who accompanied their son to @entity8 , returned home to questions from police			2
in the end , the @entity58 were not prosecuted			0
multiple sclerosis sufferer @entity60 won a high - profile battle in june to have @entity45 's law on assisted suicide clarified			1
@entity64 , who has said she wants the option of assisted suicide if her condition deteriorates , wanted to know at what point her husband might be prosecuted if he accompanied her to an assisted suicide clinic			1
@entity64 's case went all the way to the @entity74 , @entity45 's highest court , who ordered the director of public prosecutions to issue a new policy on assisted suicide			1
he did so last month			0
multiple sclerosis is chronic disease and some times can be terminal , leaving open the question whether @entity64 might qualify if the new @entity8 proposals are approved			2
at least 117 @entity45 have traveled abroad for an assisted suicide since 2002 , at an average of two a month , according to @entity85 , which advocates giving terminally ill adults the option of assisted suicide			1
@entity8 's @entity87 is now considering two proposals from the federal council , the seven - member cabinet that heads the government			2
consultations on the proposals will last until march			0
the first option would ensure that the person committing suicide is doing it of their own free will , and that the person assisting them is not driven by personal gain			2
it would also make assisted suicide an option only for those suffering from a terminal illness -- not for those suffering from a chronic or mental illness			1
the suicidal person would have to declare that he has given " long and proper consideration " to his decision , " according to the council			0
that is intended to prevent spur - of - the - moment decisions that have not been thought through , the council says			0
patients must also present two different doctor 's certificates from two different doctors , one stating that they have the legal capacity to decide their options for themselves , and the other stating that they suffer from an incurable physical illness that will result in death within a short period			0
for those with chronic or mental illnesses , the council said it supports " comprehensive treatment , care and support , in the sense of palliative medicine " rather than suicide			2
those assisting with suicide face criminal charges if they do n't make sure of these steps , the council says			0
they must also discuss alternatives to suicide with the patient , and must not accept payment for their services that would exceed the costs and expenses of the suicide			0
" this provision ensures that those assisting a suicide are not driven by personal gain , and that their prime motivation is to help the person who wishes to die , " the council says			0
" the @entity20 firmly believes that , by determining these duties of care , the negative aspects and abuse of organized assisted suicide can be prevented , and ' suicide tourism ' can be reduced			1
" the council says it prefers stricter legislation for assisted suicide , but it is also giving @entity87 a second option for a complete ban on organized assisted suicide			1
" this option rests on the belief that individuals working in assisted suicide organizations are never actually motivated by purely altruistic reasons , and may develop a close relationship with the suicidal person , " the council says			1
dignity in @entity179 said it welcomes the first option , restricting assisted suicide to terminally ill , mentally competent people			2
" individual patient autonomy has to be balanced against the need to protect potentially vulnerable people , " the group said in a statement thursday			0
" this proposal seeks to address this balance			0

@entity8 has *reputation* for *lax* laws on assisted suicide
authorities proposing *regulations* that would put limits on the the practise
recent cases have drawn attention to " suicide tourism "
