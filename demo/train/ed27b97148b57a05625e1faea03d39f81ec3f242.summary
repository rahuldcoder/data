stop judging the @entity2 woman who walked away from her alleged captor after a decade , an angry and emotional @entity0 told @entity5 's " @entity4 " on friday			1
" unless you were walking in her shoes , you have no reason to talk , none at all , " said @entity0 , one of three women freed from years of brutal captivity in a @entity9 home in 2013			1
@entity0 was referring to the case of a @entity2 woman who approached police after contacting her sister on @entity19 , saying -- according to police -- that she had been abducted by her mother 's boyfriend at 15 , then raped , beaten and forced to marry her alleged captor , @entity23			1
in the days since the woman 's story came to light , @entity23 's attorney and some of her neighbors in the @entity30 neighborhood where she lived with @entity23 and their 3 - year - old child have questioned the abduction story , saying she appeared to be happy and well cared for			1
" she never showed a sad face or worried face , " said a neighbor who identified herself only as @entity35			0
" she had plenty of time to actually escape so it 's hard to believe this is really going on because she had a lot of free time			2
" authorities have acknowledged that the woman said she reached out to her family before she went to police			1
a photo posted on @entity19 purports to show her with her mother and sister on on @entity52 -- one week before she went to authorities			1
a post in @entity55 that accompanies the photo on @entity19 reads : " after almost 10 years after not seeing my mom and little sister			2
" @entity5 can not confirm the date of the photo , and police and the prosecutor 's office declined friday to comment further on the details of the case			1
@entity23 's attorney , @entity64 , said friday he has n't had much time to talk to his client but said stories such as the neighbor 's make him doubt the state 's case			1
" if you listen to what they have to say , it sounds like he 's not guilty and it 's all fabricated , " @entity64 told @entity5			2
@entity0 has just one answer to those doubting the woman 's story : you could n't possibly understand			1
" just because you 're not chained up and you 're not locked in the basement does n't mean you ai n't trapped , " she told @entity5 's @entity78			2
" i know exactly what it feels like to be trapped in your own mind , your emotional mind , and told you ca n't do anything about it , nobody will care about what you say			0
" @entity0 was held in @entity0 's @entity9 home from august 2002 until may 2013 , when her fellow captive @entity0 summoned help from a neighbor to break out of the locked house			1
sometimes chained , frequently brutalized , @entity0 said the worst part of her decade of captivity was the isolation and the psychological manipulation her captor held over her			2
" i was threatened to be killed			0
i was threatened that nobody cared about me , " she said			0
" for a girl like her , the emotional torture is so painful that she chose not to hurt other people , " @entity0 said			2
" because he may have threatened to hurt her , he may have threatened to hurt the people that she was talking to			0
" @entity103 , who also was abducted , had a similar message in an interview thursday with @entity106 on " @entity4			0
" " well , as a survivor who has been chained up in physical chains and also had the chains of threats held over me , i can tell you firsthand that threat is so much stronger than physical chains , " said @entity107 , who was abducted from her @entity109 home in 2002			0
" now , i do n't have intimate details on what threats he was holding over her head , but i understand that he was holding her family , that he was threatening her family and , for me , that was the strongest threat anyone could have ever made to me , " she said			0
@entity0 said she worries that questions such as those raised about the @entity2 woman 's case will keep other people suffering from abuse from coming forward and seeking help			1
" you 're making people not want to come out , not want to say anything , " she said , her voice breaking			0
" you 're making people want to sit there and keep it to themselves and go through the abuse when you say stupid crap like that			0
" the @entity2 woman 's alleged captor , @entity23 , 42 , was arrested during a traffic stop wednesday			1
he is charged with a felony count of forcible rape , three felony counts of lewd acts on a minor and a felony count of kidnapping to commit a sexual offense			0
if convicted of all three crimes , he could face life in prison .			0
