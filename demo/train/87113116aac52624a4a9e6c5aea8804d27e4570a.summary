-- the days of being cut off from the internet while you 're on a plane are quickly disappearing			2
an @entity5 passenger uses @entity6 to access the internet during a flight			1
a number of domestic airlines have recently begun offering @entity6 internet access aboard planes , and other airlines say they are working toward making it happen			1
" this is the year " for @entity6 on planes , said @entity15 , president and ceo of @entity17 , whose @entity28 Â® @entity18 internet service provides access on @entity21 , @entity5 , @entity23 and @entity24 flights , and will begin testing on @entity27 flights later this year			1
@entity28 is installed on more than 200 commercial planes , and @entity15 said he expected 1,200 aircraft to have @entity28 capability by the end of 2009			1
for now , @entity6 on domestic carriers ' planes is limited to flights within @entity38			1
@entity28 , which operates by transmitting signals from ground - level towers , functions across the @entity42 and up to about 300 miles offshore			0
the company 's access will cover the entire continent within a year or two , @entity15 said			1
@entity46 , which uses satellite technology to provide connectivity to @entity49 and @entity50 , already covers much of @entity38 and will roll out trans - @entity51 and @entity54 service in the third quarter of this year , said the company 's ceo , @entity16			1
neither company would release the exact cost of turning airplanes into @entity6 hot spots			1
but @entity15 said @entity17 managed to equip a plane for " substantially " less than $ 100,000			2
@entity46 , which bills itself as the " industrial - strength solution " to airplane connectivity , costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per plane , @entity16 said			1
another company , @entity65 , is a subsidiary of @entity66 that provides free e-mail and messaging aboard flights but does n't offer open web surfing			2
@entity65 , which uses air - to - ground technology , provides the service on select @entity66 flights and also is working with @entity74 on offering internet access aboard its planes			1
the @entity6 venture has the potential to be " very profitable , " said @entity79 , an airline industry expert and professor of finance at @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84			2
" normally , air carriers rush to purchase capital equipment that raises their cost but does n't raise their revenue			0
... this is actually a revenue - producing tactic			0
and it 's a good one because it 's providing value to the passenger and it 's creating incremental revenues for the airline , " @entity79 said			0
@entity17 , which shares its revenue from @entity28 with the airlines , charges $ 9.95 for flights under three hours , $ 12.95 for flights longer than three hours and $ 7.95 to use a @entity6 capable handheld device for any flight length			1
passengers can begin using the service once the plane reaches 10,000 feet			0
if the plane remains in flight for longer than three hours as part of a delay , passengers do not pay the higher fee , @entity15 said			0
@entity79 believes that business model will evolve to entice more passengers to use it			0
the size of those fees could result in " a whole segment of the market that they 're not going to capture , " said @entity79			0
the airlines will maximize their profits by convincing more passengers to use the system with a lower price , he said			0
@entity79 predicted @entity17 and the airlines would create a second tier of service , which would be less expensive but with fewer capabilities			2
he compared the strategy to airlines ' price - reducing tactics to avoid empty seats on planes			2
as @entity17 and @entity46 's services expand , @entity65 is monitoring passengers ' usage to gauge how to move ahead with its own business model , said @entity137 , vice president of sales and marketing for the company			1
" yes , broadband is coming			0
we 're sitting there asking , ' who pays ? is it the airlines or the customers ? and what will they pay ? what is the right technology ? ... when does all of this happen ? ' we 're in weird economic times , " @entity137 said			0
as for the possibility of passengers offending their seat - mates by surfing for inappropriate content , @entity15 said nine months of @entity6 availability on @entity42 yielded no such incidents			2
still , airlines including @entity42 , @entity21 and @entity27 have requested screening for potentially offensive content , he said			0
on the other hand , @entity50 , which uses @entity46 , does not plan on using the company 's content - blocking capabilities			1
instead , flight attendants will follow standard protocol for objectionable material -- they 'll ask passengers to stow it away , said @entity169 , an airline spokeswoman			0
here is what major @entity42 airlines offer , and what is coming up :			0
