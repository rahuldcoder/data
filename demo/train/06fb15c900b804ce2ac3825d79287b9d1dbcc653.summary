-- the writing was on the wall for @entity3			2
some 25 years after the stadium disaster that cost the lives of 96 supporters , the club is marching towards its first @entity9 title since the season immediately following that tragedy at @entity12			2
the team 's players could understandably be nervous about the prospect of ending such a long wait for @entity3 's next championship -- its 19th overall and first since the advent of the @entity19			1
but , after title rival @entity22 stumbled on saturday , @entity21 ' side showed no such anxiety in dispatching struggling @entity25 3 - 2 to move five points clear at the top of the table			1
and the manager said his charges had drawn inspiration from the speech by the leader of the @entity34 , @entity35 , who spoke at tuesday 's memorial service for the victims and survivors of the 1989 stadium crush			1
" i used some words of @entity35 -- we put them up on the wall , " the @entity40 told @entity3 's website after sunday 's away win , the team 's 11th in a row			1
" she talked about stress and how it can prove difficult for you , but it can also offer you great determination to fight			0
" those were the words that we gave the players before the game today			0
this is a club that is one club at this moment in time , and we 're all fighting to achieve the ultimate goal			0
" the victory sets the scene for next sunday 's visit by @entity22 to @entity64 , and puts more pressure on third - placed @entity66 to win against another team battling to avoid relegation -- @entity69 -- on monday			1
@entity3 and @entity22 have three games left , while 2012 champion @entity66 has five -- but is nine points off the lead			1
" in the changing room before they go out , we just remind them to go and lose themselves , just focus on the ball and focus on the team , " said @entity21 , whose team is now guaranteed a place in the @entity76 for the first time since 2010			2
" if you can do that , then we can be a real force			0
you saw all the characteristics of our team -- wonderful invention , creativity , arrogance on the ball , young players and senior players all playing in a structure that allows them to express themselves			0
" and they had to show the courage to dig in and fight , away from home against a team that 's fighting for their life to stay in the division			0
it 's going to be a brilliant game next weekend			0
the supporters will be right up for it , as will the team			0
" @entity3 took a 2 - 0 lead inside 11 minutes through young winger @entity112 , with a long - range effort , and top scorer @entity114 -- who became the first player to net 30 times in the league for the club since @entity119 in 1987			1
the @entity121 striker is now just one short of the @entity19 record for a 38 - game season , held by @entity124 and @entity125			2
@entity25 , just two points above the relegation zone , hit back through striker @entity128 following the halftime break but @entity9 @entity130 hopeful @entity112 restored @entity3 's advantage just after an hour before @entity133 ' header set up a tense finish			1
" he is the best young player in @entity138 football at the moment , " @entity21 said of @entity112 , who set up @entity114 's 12th goal in five games against @entity25			1
" at 19 years of age you do n't see anyone better			0
his intelligence with the ball , his movement and he 's scoring goals			0
his first goal was a wonderful strike			0
he 's just shifted it , got his shot off ; to beat a goalkeeper of @entity153 's quality shows you the quality of the strike			0
" his pass for @entity114 ' goal was like a top midfield player , so there 's an assist , and his position for the counter attack when he broke away and obviously gets a bit of luck on the deflection -- but his overall performance , he 's shown so much maturity			2
" @entity169 's chances of qualifying for the @entity76 for the 15th successive season remain in the @entity173 club 's own hands after sunday 's 3 - 0 win at 14th - placed @entity175			1
@entity177 forward @entity176 followed up his midweek double in the 3 - 1 victory at home to @entity181 by scoring twice more following @entity183 's opener -- the @entity186 midfielder 's ninth in the league this season and first since this month 's return from long - term injury			1
@entity191 closed to within a point of fourth - placed @entity169 by beating @entity193 2 - 0 in sunday 's later game -- billed as a clash between managers @entity196 and @entity198			1
it was a bitter blow for former @entity191 boss @entity198 , who has had a miserable first season with defending champion @entity193 -- and now knows that next season the club will not be playing in the @entity76			0
a penalty from @entity205 and another goal from striker @entity207 before halftime left @entity193 13 points behind @entity169 .			2

@entity3 five points clear in @entity19 after beating @entity25 3 - 2 on sunday
@entity112 scores twice and sets up @entity114 's 30th league goal this season
manager @entity21 says team drew inspiration from @entity12 memorial
