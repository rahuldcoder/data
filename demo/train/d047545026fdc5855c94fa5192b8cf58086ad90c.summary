-- @entity1 of @entity2 considered the military couple who raised her as generous , humanitarian people , taking her into their home as if their own baby because her real parents were killed in a shootout in @entity11 in 1976			1
she had no reason to believe otherwise -- until the year she turned 24			0
that 's when a group investigating the atrocities of @entity2 's so - called @entity16 from 1976 to 1983 told @entity17 that her real parents were among " the disappeared ones , " as the war victims are hauntingly called			1
what happened to the thousands of disappeared ones -- mainly leftists -- is an enduring agony of the war 's horrors			0
@entity26 felt betrayed -- and shocked to realize that the couple who raised her were part of the military regime responsible for her parents ' disappearance			1
" i was ' appropriated , ' " @entity26 said , using the term given to children whose parents were killed or disappeared during the @entity16 and were given to other couples			1
" it took me several years to assimilate my new identity and find peace about my true background			2
" now a 36 - year - old mother of three children , @entity17 learned another truth this week : one of eight unidentified bodies found across the border in @entity48 in 2002 was confirmed to be the remains of her father			1
@entity26 , who disappeared at age 20 in 1976 when @entity53 was just a few days old , was an apparent victim of the war 's barbaric " death flights , " a series of military airplane rides in which political prisoners were thrown alive into the sea , forensic investigators said			1
his body probably washed ashore on the @entity48 coast , and someone buried him in a nameless grave			1
" i personally feel that there is no word for so many feelings , " she told reporters this week , describing her country as " a genocidal state " that threw her father into the ocean			1
today , @entity53 @entity1 feels disconnected from her military father -- who died in 2003 -- because he was part of the regime targeting liberals like her real parents			1
her adoptive mother died recently			2
affection for the adoptive couple has dissipated : they had been good parents who raised her well			2
she feels no hate or animosity -- just betrayal , she told @entity0 this week			2
she felt " peace " knowing the truth about her father 's fate			0
but now she wonders about what happened to her mother			0
the group investigating the war 's legacy , @entity92 ( may @entity93 ) , which determined her father 's fate through dna testing , is now continuing to help @entity1 about the mystery of her mother -- as well as thousands of others who were taken away from their politically persecuted parents as children			2
@entity105 , a spokesman with @entity106 , said that for @entity1 , learning the truth about her parents was n't easy			0
" it took a long time for her to accept it ; but when she did , she was then ready for the next step , which was finding out how her parents died , " @entity105 said			0
the @entity115 ( @entity116 by its @entity118 acronym ) announced this week that forensic and dna tests prove that human remains found in a @entity48 cemetery are those of @entity123 , known as " @entity124			1
" said @entity53 @entity17 : " it is a miracle that the @entity126 , with a drop of my blood , has succeeded in identifying the remains of my father that were in @entity48 since may ' 76			1
" @entity132 , president of @entity116 , said that identifying the remains of @entity1 was a process that started 10 years ago in @entity135 , @entity48 , across the @entity136 from @entity11			1
" in 2002 we exhumed eight unidentified bodies from the cemetery in @entity135			0
at that time , we had no hypothesis as to how the bodies ended up there , " said @entity132			0
@entity116 took dna and forensic samples from the bodies			0
in 2007 , the independent organization started taking blood and @entity143 samples from people in @entity2 with missing relatives			0
@entity53 @entity1 was one of 8,500 people who left samples over the following four years			1
finally , a match was made this year			0
but how did the body of a man kidnapped in @entity11 end up in a different country ? @entity132 believes @entity26 was killed during the so - called " death flights			1
" @entity26 's body probably washed ashore on the @entity48 coast			1
a nameless tombstone was placed over his grave in @entity135			0
for @entity1 , seeking the truth about her origins has been a slow and painful process , but she says knowing what truly happened has given her some closure			0
" recovering my true identity was paramount , " @entity26 said			2
" having a true identity is a human right			0
recovering the remains of my father has been important not only to understand how he died , but also to bring some justice to @entity2 and the victims of the regime			2
" @entity26 said her rendezvous with her past is only halfway done			2
she has no knowledge or clues about what happened to her mother			0
now with a son who , at 20 , is as old as her father was when he disappeared , @entity26 said she hopes the episode shines a little more light on a dark past			1
" as painful as it may be , we need to find the truth about our history , " she said			0
" by exhuming and identifying our loved ones after all these years , we give them back their dignity			0

@entity53 @entity17 , 36 , learned of her real father just 12 years ago
she learned this week that a body found in a @entity48 cemetery was his
she also learned that her adoptive parents were part of the military regime
@entity26 was 20 when he was a victim of the 1976 - 83 " @entity16 "
