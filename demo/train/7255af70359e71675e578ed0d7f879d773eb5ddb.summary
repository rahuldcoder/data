-- for women who have already seen combat , it is a decision that is well overdue			1
but for the skeptics , it is a setback that will damage the military			2
the @entity7 's reported decision to lift the ban on women in combat units will take time to put into effect , but many former service members are lauding reports that the @entity7 will make the change soon			1
" we have an all - volunteer force , and i think that this opens up a pool of folks who could serve in these positions , " said rep. @entity16 , an @entity17 veteran who lost both legs and the use of one arm when her helicopter crew was shot down in 2004			1
" any time that we 've opened up our military to performance - based service ... we 've benefited as a military			1
this is good for the nation			2
" the new policy will be implemented over the next three years , and some units may apply for exemptions , a senior defense official told @entity0			1
many readers doubt wisdom of decision @entity16 , an @entity41 @entity40 , said the military should open up every unit to women and see if they can complete the required training			1
" if the women ca n't meet the standards , they do n't get to graduate from the program			1
" @entity51 rep. @entity50 , a @entity52 @entity40 who served with her state 's @entity53 in @entity55 , said the move is a " major step that is long overdue			1
" interviewed by @entity0 's @entity58 , @entity50 said it 's a " great recognition ... of all the women who are currently serving overseas , many of them in these combat type situations already			1
" @entity50 was asked whether the move is merely semantics because front lines are constantly shifting and disappearing in today 's world , and women already have been in combat situations			1
" i think so , " @entity50 said			2
" when we look at , for example , two women , the first two women who earned @entity71 since @entity72 , one was a military police sergeant , another was a medic			1
and they both were operating on the front lines per se , under fire , under extreme duress , shoulder to shoulder with their male and female counterparts , and exhibiting great courage and heroism and saving the lives of their brothers and sisters			2
" @entity89 , who has served more than 13 years in the @entity90 and did tours in @entity55 and @entity92 , thinks the change reflects the military catching up with the times			2
some women have already gone on patrols with ground troops , helping to talk with female civilians in @entity92			1
some submarine crews have added female officers			0
women also serve as military police officers			2
join the discussion on @entity105 women supporting supply missions have been drawn into battle in @entity55 and @entity92 , where there are no physical front lines			1
now , @entity89 said , " people will be able to serve in the career fields they are qualified for , and they wo n't be turned away because of their gender			0
" @entity89 went to @entity55 in may 2007 as part of then - president @entity116 's " surge policy " to put more troops on the ground			1
" the first death i experienced was a woman , within the first few weeks i was in @entity55 , " she said			0
it was june 25 , 2007 , and her outpost in @entity123 came under mortar fire			0
in the attack , @entity126 staff sgt. @entity125 of @entity127 , @entity128 , was killed			0
@entity125 , 27 , was assigned to a support battalion			0
days later , @entity89 came under mortar fire again			0
this time , her comrade -- a cameraman -- was injured			0
even though her deployment orders said @entity134 , she spent weeks in the summer of 2007 shuttling between bases in @entity55 and @entity92			0
like many women in the military , @entity89 did n't get the additional combat training because she was in what was considered a support role			1
" i really want to stress there was no bitterness			0
it was a reflection of the times , and i feel like we are now getting with the times , " she said			0
" i see this as a positive thing			0
" join the discussion on @entity150 not everyone agrees			0
rep. @entity152 , an @entity154 @entity153 , has said he does n't think women are physically capable of combat duty			1
" to have women serving in infantry ... could impair the mission essential task of those units , and that 's been proven in study after study , " he told radio host @entity157 this month			1
" it 's nature -- upper body strength and physical movements and speed and endurance and so forth			2
" @entity173 , one of the founders of the military blog " this @entity177 n't @entity176 , " wrote that he thinks it was an " ill - considered decision			2
" @entity173 , a former sergeant who fought in @entity179 , wrote that he is opposed to women in combat units , not because women are a distraction but because he thinks the @entity126 and other services will be required to accept more women than are qualified or can be trained			1
" if we 're doing this to make the military better , fine , but if we 're doing it just to beat our collective chest and show how just we are , then that 's how a lot of body bags are going to get filled , " he wrote			0
@entity105 thread : military to open combat jobs to women @entity196 , author of the memoir " @entity196 : @entity201 and @entity202 in the @entity126 , " said she thought most of the enlisted men would accept women into combat units			1
" they will do their jobs , they will be professional , perhaps a few will be disgruntled , " she said			0
" troops grumble , that 's what we do , but many of them have already served along with women			1
" @entity196 , who saw combat while with the @entity214 , said she thought some branches of the military would ask for exceptions to the policy , and that was hard to argue with			1
" let 's take this step and let women keep proving what they have already proved before , " she said			1
sgt. 1st class @entity224 with the 4th @entity226 , @entity227 , at @entity228 , @entity229 , said it was impossible to know what , if any , changes it would mean for women in the military			2
" it 's not just put females in combat ( specialties ) and let 's call it a day , " she said			2
a number of issues , including safety regulations and cohabitation , will need to be addressed , she said			0
@entity126 staff sgt. @entity245 said that , like @entity224 , she was n't surprised by the news			0
troops have speculated about the issue for a while , but @entity245 , who is a career counselor , said she has yet to have a female soldier approach her about joining a combat unit			1
by the numbers : women in the @entity51 military @entity50 was asked about a newspaper column that argued there would be times someone would be forced to be naked in front of the opposite sex , and that would be distracting , awkward , uncomfortable and potentially traumatizing			2
does the writer have a point ? " i respectfully disagree			0
i think that in these situations we 're talking about highly trained professionals , people who build our strong military because they place the mission first and they 're there to fight as a member of a team			0
all of the other things that differentiate us , make us unique , whether it be gender or race or religion , all of these things fall aside when you 're there putting the mission first and selflessly serving as that member of a team , " @entity50 said			0
" i can tell you from my own firsthand experience as well as the many , many people i 've had the honor of serving with , whether in training or in a deployed setting , those things are not what 's crossing your mind when you 're operating			0
" @entity291 , president @entity292 's nominee for defense secretary , did n't comment on the issue			0
he was asked for his reaction after he left a meeting at the @entity297 on wednesday			0
" we 've got a hearing i 'm looking forward to next week , " he said , suggesting he may confront the matter then			0
what do you think about women in combat ? share your thoughts on @entity305			1
we especially would like to hear from women			2
@entity0 's @entity307 and @entity308 in @entity309 and @entity310 in @entity311 contributed to this report .			0
