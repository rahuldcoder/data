-- new junior federal prosecutors literally started in the basement of the @entity4 courthouse in downtown @entity5			1
i moved into my subterranean office in january 1990			0
a few weeks later , @entity8 moved into her new digs down the hall			2
we were assistant @entity4 attorneys in the @entity12 , which covers @entity5 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
the work of this @entity4 attorney 's office is unglamorous , especially for new hires			1
our jurisdiction included @entity21 in @entity13 , so our introductory cases often involved low - level drug smuggling , especially the " swallowers " who ingested condoms full of cocaine or heroin			0
@entity8 thrived in that chaotic environment			1
and now , two - plus decades later , it looks like she will be the next attorney general of the @entity4			1
she has been @entity4 attorney twice in the courthouse where she came up -- first under president @entity32 and currently under president @entity33			2
she is not a well - known figure , even in @entity35			0
she is a workhorse , not a show horse , and she has flourished doing the hard , ordinary work of federal prosecution -- narcotics cases , organized crime ( always big in @entity5 ) , public corruption ( ditto ) and civil rights violations			2
@entity8 has showed her strengths more as an administrator than as a courtroom performer			1
she always had good relations with the @entity4 attorney 's " clients " -- the @entity51 , @entity52 and other law enforcement agencies			1
still , against heavy pressure from the @entity35 police , she led a full investigation and prosecution of the horrible assault of @entity59 by @entity61 officers in 1997			0
she is a tough and successful @entity35 , but she has also never forgotten her @entity63 roots			0
there is a @entity66 graciousness about her ( and her accent ) , and it will certainly be on display in any confirmation hearings			0
two major questions loom over her prospective tenure as attorney general			1
first , will she continue the emphasis on voting rights that @entity75 displayed ? the answer is almost certainly yes			1
like @entity75 , she comes from the generation after the civil rights movement , but it is part of her dna , and that will come through in her priorities			2
the more interesting question involves drugs			0
@entity75 moved carefully but steadily to reduce federal prosecutions of low - level narcotics offenses , especially marijuana			2
in addition , he started plans to lower the sentences of federal inmates who were convicted under those laws			0
will @entity8 continue these efforts ? she has no public track record on these policy issues , though she has aggressively prosecuted narcotics offenders in @entity5			1
this area offers a possible route for cooperation with some @entity100 , like sen. @entity101 , who were sympathetic to @entity75 on this issue			0
in any event , one verdict is clear : @entity8 has come a long way from that basement we shared .			0

@entity109 , who worked with @entity8 , says she thrived in chaotic @entity4 court in @entity5
she showed strength there more as administrator than courtroom performer , @entity109 says
he asks if she will keep @entity75 's voting rights ' emphasis if *tapped* as attorney general
@entity109 : and will she continue @entity75 's efforts on reducing drug *penalties* ?
