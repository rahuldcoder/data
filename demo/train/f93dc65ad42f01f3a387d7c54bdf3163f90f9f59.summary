we all know that every baby is special , but @entity3 pulled off a rare feat right out of the womb			1
days before he 's scheduled to leave the hospital , he 's already gone viral on social media because he was born ' en caul			1
' @entity3 was completely encased in his amniotic sac , said @entity11 ' @entity10 in a @entity13 post			1
that 's so rare , that even doctors delivering babies hardly see it			2
so @entity3 ' doctor snapped a photo with his cell phone			2
it looked like the baby was trapped in a big water bubble			0
" even though it 's a cliche -- we caught our breath , " neonatologist @entity24 told @entity1 affiliate @entity25			2
" it really felt like a moment of awe			0
" then @entity24 got to work helping @entity3 to breathe - and giving him special care , because @entity3 was born three months before his due date via caesarean section			1
later , @entity3 ' grandmother showed the cell phone photo to his mother , @entity37			2
" it was definitely like a clear film , where you could definitely make out his head and his hair , " @entity3 told the affiliate			2
@entity3 was curled up in fetal position inside			0
the amniotic sac is an opaque bubble that covers all babies in the womb from right after conception			1
as the baby grows , it fills with fluid , including the baby 's urine			0
the sac cushions the baby from bumps and jostles during mom 's daily ups and downs			0
normally , during a birth , it breaks , and the fluid rushes out , which is where the term ' breaking water ' comes from			0
but sometimes , the sac can get stuck around part of the baby , according to dr. @entity69 , an obstetrician and gynecologist , who publishes a website on birth and baby care			0
it can , for example , get stuck on the baby 's head , which makes it look like its wearing a glass space helmet			0
that 's also where the term caul comes from -- it derives from @entity84 words that refer to a helmet			1
after @entity88 shock , mom gives birth to two sets of identical twins such amniotic sac helmet births are rare enough , but to have the entire baby inside the sac , or ' en caul , ' occurs in less than one in 80,000 births , @entity10 said			1
when @entity3 heard how rare her @entity100 's birth was , she was flabbergasted			1
" i was like , oh my gosh , @entity3 , you 're a little special baby , " she told @entity25			0
it 's particularly surprising in a c - section , because the scalpel usually pierces the amniotic sac			1
the doctors must have missed @entity3 's			1
@entity109 woman gives birth to 14.1 - pound baby boy			0

@entity3 was born ' en caul , ' with completely surrounded by his amniotic sac
that 's very rare -- it occurs in fewer than one in 80,000 births
