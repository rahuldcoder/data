@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity5 new wave ska legends @entity3 rounded off the @entity7 leg of their 30th anniversary tour with an electric performance that threatened to bring the crumbling south @entity1 venue crashing to the ground			1
the frenzied crowd at @entity1 's @entity13 the six - piece 2 - tone outfit originally from the @entity15 played a total of five dates at what is now the @entity19 , such was the phenomenal demand for tickets			1
it 's no surprise really			2
from the rarefied perspective of the vip bar , the sea of bobbing heads and mobile phone displays ( which seem to have replaced cigarette lighters ) created a fantastic spectacle			2
but down among the rude boys and rude girls the carnival atmosphere seemed to ratchet up a notch with each song			2
@entity38 , sweaty 40 - something men in @entity37 polo shirts were transported back to the late 1970s as they bounced around unselfconsciously , while @entity40 indie kids sloshed their pints in the air and enjoyed this unique experience for the first time			1
no one was standing with their arms folded here			0
despite songwriter @entity49 ' continued absence and @entity51 's lost voice , the band was as tight as it ever was , both musically and personally			1
as soon as the curtain rose the band wasted little time plugging into the hysteria that greeted them			0
if " do @entity59 " appeared to hit the spot , then tracks such as " @entity57 , " and " gangsters " literally had the earth moving in this imposing old theatre			1
@entity62 , showing no sign of fatigue after a recent throat infection and the band 's homecoming gig in @entity68 the previous night , was in a chirpy mood			0
the @entity71 fan enjoyed reminding the @entity1 audience about his team 's league success that afternoon			0
meanwhile , the irrepressible @entity75 seemed to galvanize the rest of the band with his seemingly limitless energy -- he must have spent the entire gig running on the spot			0
the dapper singer has aged well and was clearly reveling in the band 's return to the spotlight			0
despite only reforming recently , the specials have rediscovered their mojo			2
they possess the kind of stage presence reserved for the truly great acts , while their lyrics still resonate today			0
" @entity99 " encapsulated the gritty reality of @entity5 's urban landscape in 1981 , and few in the audience would have argued that it remains a relevant portrait in today 's troubled economic times .			1
