sometimes , people pretend to die			0
that 's pretty much the basic idea behind " @entity4 , " a thought - provoking series of portraits by photographer @entity7			1
these images reveal a whole new perspective on @entity12 's @entity11 re-enactors			1
but they also aim to spark conversations about two things that touch us all : life and death			1
for generations , enthusiasts and history buffs have been spending their weekends re-staging historic clashes of the @entity11 , pretending to lose their lives on the battlefield			1
@entity7 uses his camera to study these faces while they fake death			1
some have their eyes closed			0
some looking away , others looking directly at us			0
but because we know they 're really alive , it 's somehow captivating			2
" i think there 's a shifting back and forth between life and death as you look at them , " @entity7 said			1
" when there 's this oddness and this shifting , i think it holds our attention a little longer , which hopefully brings us into each of our own individual conversations about what life and death means and what war means to us as individuals			1
" admittedly , the concept is a heavy one			0
to make it more approachable , @entity7 injected a bit of humor			1
he started collecting reasons why re-enactors choose to live or die during their performances			0
after " dying " on battlefields 148 times , longtime re-enactor @entity57 told @entity7 he has decided to quit dying			1
now , @entity7 said , @entity57 " leaves the dying to the young			1
" " that statement really stuck with me , " @entity7 said			2
and it propelled him to jump feet first into the project			0
another re-enactor told @entity7 at historic @entity65 , @entity66 , that " he does n't die very often because he 's one of the few that are actually in shape and can make it all the way across the battlefield			1
" a third re-enactor said he dies " almost every time because he finds it more realistic , " @entity7 said			2
" another guy told me he does n't die in the high grass because he has allergies			0
" social media follow @ @entity81 on @entity82 to join the conversation about photography			0
2015 marks 150 years since the war 's end			1
the death toll totaled nearly 500,000 @entity89 and @entity90 soldiers , according to the @entity12 @entity91			0
@entity7 's project helped him understand and respect the solemn reasons behind the re-enactments			1
" @entity4 " was inspired by its sister project , " @entity98 , " which focuses on landscapes linked to the @entity11			1
" i 've always been fascinated by war in general since i was little -- not so much in a romantic way -- but more in a frightening way , " @entity7 said			1
" it 's always kind of scared the crap out of me , basically			0
" the dramatic rift the nation felt in the 1860s reminds him of today 's political landscape			0
" i feel like the country is basically paralyzed by the divide in politics , " @entity7 said			2
when it comes to equipment , this guy leans totally old school			0
@entity7 shot the project entirely on film , using what photographers call a view camera , which has a basic design dating back to the 19th century			2
projects can become more collaborative with a view camera , @entity7 said			2
during the " @entity4 " portrait shoots , he enjoyed explaining to the re-enactors how the camera works and its long exposure time			1
@entity7 photographed each re-enactor as they laid on a suspended platform , giving the impression they were hovering above the ground			2
@entity7 then climbed up a ladder to access his camera , which was aimed down toward the re-enactor			2
once underneath the camera 's " dark cloth , " he opened the shutter and captured an image			0
" i personally do n't enjoy digital photography that much , " @entity7 said			2
" i do n't have anything against it			0
i think it works marvelously for lots of applications			0
but for me , i 'm pretty devoted to film for ... the way i work with it ... and the way it looks			0
" @entity7 , 32 , spent most of his first 16 years growing up on a sheep farm in central @entity66 before moving with his family to @entity151			1
his interest in taking pictures eventually led to college degrees in @entity155 and @entity156			0
he has been published several times and last year he won the @entity158			0
lately , @entity7 admits life has become a little crazy , as he juggles teaching at @entity162 's @entity161 while helping create the school 's first formal photography program			1
" teaching and being intimately involved in an academic art department is a great inspiration and motivation and it provides an incredible collaborative community , " @entity7 said			2
" and i 'm very thankful for that			0
" @entity7 is a photographer and professor at the @entity161			1
