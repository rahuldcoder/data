-- three years after the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell , " the now - defunct law prohibiting gay men , lesbians and bisexuals from serving openly in the armed forces , many @entity1 might not know that a significant form of discrimination still exists : the @entity1 military bans transgender people			1
military recruiters are required to turn down attempts by transgender americans to enlist			2
if , after joining the military , service members are discovered to be transgender , they are fired			1
no other federal agency operates this way			0
because of the @entity21 's ban , an estimated 15,500 transgender people serving in the military have to hide and lie about who they are			1
this has devastating consequences for them , and makes it impossible to access medically necessary health care without risking discharge			0
careers are ruined , and the military wastes resources training competent service members and then firing them when their gender identity is discovered			1
that 's just what happened to @entity35 , a transgender man who served as a @entity37 cryptologist in @entity38 last year			2
@entity35 was so good at his job that his superiors put him up for a promotion			0
but in the course of preparing the paperwork , a colleague discovered that @entity35 was born a girl , so he was sent home and ushered out of the @entity37			0
defense secretary @entity47 announced three months ago that he is open to reviewing the ban , and the @entity49 expressed support			0
however , since @entity53 's announcement , no progress has been made toward a resolution , and some observers have questioned whether the military could include transgender personnel without difficulty			2
transgender ex-navy seal : here 's a question for you to answer that question , a commission of leading legal , military and medical experts , including the @entity66 's former chief medical officer , has completed a study on how to implement inclusive policy			1
the commission , which @entity71 co-chair , conducted an analysis of foreign military forces , as well as @entity1 military experiences of previously excluded populations			0
our research indicates that allowing transgender personnel to serve will be neither burdensome nor complex			0
we found that as with any policy change , the implementation of an inclusive approach should be handled in a thoughtful and deliberate manner			1
that said , we found that the administrative and regulatory changes needed to implement inclusive policy are minimal , and that strong leadership will be sufficient for avoiding any potential problems			0
before implementing the repeal of " @entity88 , " the @entity21 created an internal working group that took a year to formulate advice about how to repeal the ban			2
its guidance was based on extensive research , including a survey it administered to 400,000 service members			1
additionally , the military commissioned the @entity98 to complete a simultaneous study on the same implementation questions the internal @entity21 working group was considering			0
while the working group and the @entity98 report produced useful recommendations , the snail 's pace approach to implementation was based on the need to build political support , not by any complexities involved in lifting the ban			0
because " do n't ask , do n't tell " was a congressional statute , the administration had to persuade a bipartisan coalition in @entity114 to support repeal , and the extensive research on implementation helped those efforts			0
but eliminating the restrictions on transgender service membersâ € ” and embracing them as equal and respected members of our nation 's armed forcesâ € ” does not require the repeal of any law			1
since the ban can be lifted without waiting for @entity114 , there is no reason for delay : the @entity132 administration should immediately announce a moratorium on firing transgender service members , and begin implementing a policy of inclusion			1
president @entity132 has made it clear that when @entity114 will not help him solve the nation 's problems , he can and will take executive action to get meaningful work done			2
lifting the military 's transgender ban is a win - win opportunity because the policy will strengthen both the armed forces and our democracy .			1

@entity150 : " @entity88 " gone , but military still bans transgender people
@entity150 : 15,500 transgender people in the military must hide or they will get *kicked* out
@entity150 : careers are ruined ; *talent* and training lost . policy change would not be difficult
@entity150 : @entity132 could end the firing of transgender service members and drop the ban
