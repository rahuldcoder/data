-- two days before @entity2 goes on trial , voice recognition experts testified it is not possible to positively identify whose screams are heard in the background of the 911 calls made the night @entity8 was shot			1
@entity10 judge @entity9 will continue the hearing on the admissibility of the experts ' testimony at a later date			1
a third audio expert was unable to testify saturday because he was stuck on a plane			2
the defense argues the state 's audio experts are using unproven science to determine who is heard screaming and they should n't be allowed to testify			1
@entity26 wanted to hear about the technology used for voice analysis			0
@entity8 shooting @entity29 forensic audio expert dr. @entity30 , who testified via teleconference from the @entity32 , described research involving the recording of stressed cries versus normal voice samples			0
in the case of the 911 calls , @entity30 said that the poor quality of the recorded voices means that none of the processes available can provide any useful information about the identity of the screaming person			1
" i 've never come across a case in the 30 years of my career where anybody has attempted to compare screaming with normal voices , " @entity30 said			0
@entity30 also said in this case the recording " is n't even remotely suitable for speaker comparison			0
" @entity53 , an electrical engineer who works as an adviser with the @entity55 , testified saturday that his conclusion about the 911 call was similar to dr. @entity30 's : that due to the quality of the data , it is not going to provide any viable source for making an identity decision			2
@entity53 said evaluating one second of speech to reach a conclusion is " ridiculous			0
" " the less you have , the worse the performance , " he said			0
@entity2 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , is charged with second - degree murder in the death of @entity8 , 17 , on february 26 , 2012 , in @entity69 , @entity10			1
he says he shot the teenager in self - defense			0
the audio technology may be key to the prosecution 's case because its experts ' testimony may be able to shed light on what was said between @entity2 and @entity8 moments before the teenager was shot			1
@entity81 , a voice analysis expert who testified friday , believes that the screams recorded were not @entity2 , but more likely came from @entity8			2
@entity85 , a forensic audio engineer , testified friday that his analysis of the 911 call indicated that the person screaming was not @entity2 , and the person screaming is frantically asking for help in different ways before the gunshot is heard			1
if the prosecution experts ' analysis indicates @entity8 screamed for help , it could hurt the credibility of @entity2 's claim that he acted in self - defense			1
the law states that for technology to be admissible , it must be " generally accepted " in that particular field			0
@entity2 's attorneys are arguing the technology does not satisfy that threshold .			2
