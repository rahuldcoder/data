a former @entity2 player apparently lived up to his old @entity5 team 's name and says he swam nine miles in the ocean to shore after falling off his boat			1
fighting back tears , @entity8 , 38 , recounted an incredible story monday at a press conference in @entity12 , @entity13			1
he said he swam through cold water in the @entity15 for about 16 hours , alternating between the breast stroke and backstroke			1
jellyfish stung him , and he was once circled by a shark , he said			2
appearing healthy , his wife sitting next to him , @entity8 told reporters that , treading water in the moments after falling off his boat wednesday off the @entity13 coast , he knew how improbable his survival was			1
he had read about what happens to the body under such circumstances			2
he figured that he had maybe three hours before hypothermia set in			1
it might take him more than 10 hours , at best , to get to shore			1
but he told himself he would make it			2
" i 've got two beautiful daughters , " he said , his eyes watering			0
" i was hitting shore			2
" @entity8 said he departed alone in his 36 - foot @entity35 boat from @entity36 , @entity13 , at about 10:30 a.m. wednesday and went about nine miles offshore			1
he set the boat on autopilot for 5 mph and started to fish			2
he said he hooked a fish around 1 p.m. and while trying to reel it in , a huge wave smashed into the boat and he lost his footing and fell overboard			1
the boat was moving east , he said , toward the @entity45			2
he was n't wearing a flotation device and did n't see any other boats around			0
" i quickly realized i was in a real bad situation , " he recounted			0
" i made a decision that i was going to start swimming toward shore , west			2
" over the next 16 hours , he said he had two opportunities to be rescued			1
he saw a recreational fishing vessel			2
he was floating about 50 yards from it and tried to swim closer , but no one spotted or heard him			2
a little later , a @entity57 @entity56 helicopter circled and shined its light on him , he recounted			0
" they had come right over the top of me , " he said			0
but the helicopter flew away			0
" that was a difficult time			0
i realized at that point in time ... i was on my own			0
@entity64 told @entity0 on monday that @entity66 authorities contacted the @entity56 to report that @entity8 was missing and that it had a helicopter out looking for the former fullback			1
down to his underwear , @entity8 alternated between breast stroke and backstroke , mustering the strength to keep swimming			1
he made it through the night , and managed to coach himself to remain calm despite seeing " glowing " creatures in the water			2
when he heard waves crashing against the shore , he told himself : " at that point , you ca n't not make it ? " at around 4:30 a.m. thursday , @entity8 said he hit the shore in @entity66			1
he was shivering uncontrollably so he curled into a ball and tried to warm himself up			0
he had trouble walking but eventually made his way to a home where a security guard was working			0
the guard notified that @entity88 , according to a department report			0
@entity8 was taken to the hospital , where he said he was treated for hypothermia , severe dehydration and rhabdomyolysis , the breakdown of muscle tissue			1
@entity8 's remarkable experience has wowed distance swimmers			1
@entity98 , a nationally renowned distance swimmer , has swum the 22 - mile course around @entity100 , @entity101 , five times			0
he 's trained in the same waters in @entity13 where @entity8 fought against the odds			1
" if you 're a good swimmer and you 're faced with an emergency , you could be capable of doing what he did , " @entity98 said			0
the @entity108 said it is investigating the boat incident			2
depending on @entity8 's location in the @entity111 , he would have had to swim west , across the water 's south - to - north current , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity113			1
the current could have been up to 4 mph			0
normally swimming a mile in the ocean could take 20 to 30 minutes -- if a person is very fit , @entity98 said			0
most professional swimmers do n't attempt that many miles without help from a team providing hydration and nutrition			0
@entity8 is the ceo of @entity123 , a @entity13 financial services company			1
a fullback , he played at @entity125 and was drafted by the @entity2 in the second round of the @entity127			0
he played his entire pro career for the @entity2 -- 82 games , according to @entity130			0
he was released from his contract in 2005			0
" i ca n't imagine that swimming is n't part of his typical workout , " @entity98 said			0
@entity8 said he judged which direction to swim by looking at the sun during the day and the stars at night			1
but even if @entity8 knew which direction to start swimming , he 'd have to contend with constant saltwater in his eyes , intense muscle fatigue , wind and , of course , current , noted @entity146 , president and ceo of the @entity147 in @entity148			1
" from the salt alone , you 'd have a tongue the size of a baseball , " said @entity146			0
it makes sense that @entity8 stripped down in the water to lessen the drag , @entity146 added			1
a former pro athlete like @entity8 knows what it takes to push past pain , @entity98 surmised			1
he would know how to focus and to stay calm , too			0
sitting next to her husband monday , @entity162 said he has always been the kind of guy who never gives up			0
" @entity8 is a very powerful human being , " she said			1
" he set his mind on something and he does go after it			0
" @entity171 : @entity8 's amazing swim for survival @entity0 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			1
