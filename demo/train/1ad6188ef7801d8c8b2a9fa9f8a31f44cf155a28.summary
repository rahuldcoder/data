an @entity3 outfit based in northeastern @entity4 has been drawing up plans since at least the middle of last year to kidnap @entity7 and others in neighboring countries , a @entity1 security source told @entity2 on friday			1
the source said the terrorists want to go into countries such as @entity13 and @entity14 and bring hostages back to @entity4 , where they could be used in @entity3 propaganda videos , according to intelligence gathered on the planning			1
after producing at least seven highly publicized clips in which hostages were beheaded , @entity3 may believe it needs to kidnap more people			1
it 's hard to know how many captives @entity3 and other groups have because governments , employers and families tend to keep kidnappings quiet for fear of putting the victims in greater danger while negotiators work to secure their release			0
the group , which is based in the area of @entity35 , has financial resources to sneak across borders and bribe security guards who might be sympathetic to their cause			2
some of the funds have come from ransoms paid for the release of other hostages			0
a new @entity3 - affiliated group in @entity45 might be keen to help snatch @entity7			2
opinion : @entity3 has miscalculated @entity2 national security commentator and former rep. @entity48 said the report is " very plausible			2
" the large number of refugees streaming out of @entity4 into @entity13 and @entity14 could give the terrorists cover at the border , he said			1
@entity3 may try to capture aid workers at the refugee camps			1
there are many @entity3 sympathizers in northern @entity14 , which borders @entity4 , said lt. col. @entity58 , a retired airman and a former @entity60 military attach√© in @entity4			1
" and that border is very , very porous , " he said			0
another big concern , the experts said , would be that other groups could abduct people and sell them to @entity3			0
" it is a cash business			0
we should make no mistake about it , " @entity48 said			0
@entity3 putting price tags on @entity73 children , selling them as slaves , @entity70 says			0

@entity3 has beheaded hostages for propaganda purposes and traded some for ransom
@entity1 security source said group could target @entity13 and @entity14
there are many camps near the borders *housing* refugees *--* and aid workers
