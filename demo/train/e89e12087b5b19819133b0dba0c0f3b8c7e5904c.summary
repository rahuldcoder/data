the attacks have been made against members of the resistance , union members and journalists , as well as their children , the panel said			1
@entity5 returned to democracy in january , and the newly installed government of president @entity36 bears responsibility for safeguarding civil liberties and human rights , the commission said			1
" @entity5 must adopt urgent measures to guarantee the rights to life , humane treatment and personal liberty , " the panel said in a report			1
" all persons , without distinction , must be equally protected in the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression , assembly , and political participation			1
" @entity5 ' top law enforcement official said he " laments and deplores " violence that resulted from the coup that removed president @entity58 from power and installed interim president @entity60			1
" we will strengthen our investigations aimed at clearing up these events , appointing a special squad that will produce the arrests of those responsible and the unrestricted application of justice , " minister of security oscar @entity63 said last week			1
@entity60 instituted martial law during his seven - month rule , and some @entity58 supporters say they were harassed , arrested or worse			0
human rights will be respected under @entity78 , who was elected in november and assumed the presidency january 27 , national police commissioner @entity76 said monday			1
@entity80 has been in office for only about a month but has promised to tackle the problem , @entity76 said			1
the @entity2 commission said that one of the recently killed activists was 29 - year - old @entity86 , who was found february 3			1
according to the panel , witnesses said her body was thrown out of a car			1
another activist , union member @entity92 , was chatting outside his home in @entity94 on february 15 when two men on a motorcycle fatally shot him twice , the rights commission said			2

" two unknown individuals came to her door , and when she opened it , @entity106 was shot and killed in front of her children , ages 2 and 8 , " the report said			2
the @entity8 also expressed concern that activists ' family members are being threatened and harassed , with two of them killed in the past few weeks			2

eight days earlier , the commission said , seven heavily armed men dressed in military uniforms and wearing ski masks abducted five members of a family active in the resistance			0
one of those taken captive , the panel said , was a young woman who reported in august being raped by four police officers who detained her in connection with an anti-coup demonstration			2
in the february 9 abduction , the armed men intercepted the vehicle in which the young woman was traveling with her brother , her sister and two other people			0
when the occupants offered to turn over the car keys , the report said , the men answered that they wanted the young woman , " to see if she would report them this time			2
" " the five were forced at gunpoint to walk into the mountains , where two of the women were sexually violated ; the third was the victim of robbery and death threats , and the two men were subjected to physical torture , " the report said			1
" they were released hours later			0
" analysts note that violence is not new to @entity5 , nor is it limited in scope			0
the violence can be political , from all sides of the spectrum			2
it can be criminal , either random or organized			0

" poverty , gangs and low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to a critical crime rate , including mass slayings , the @entity191 said			0
but political violence deserves special attention to safeguard democracy , the @entity2 panel said			1

@entity182 , who supported @entity60 , spent three days in @entity5 last week and met with @entity78 , the new president			2
the new administration , @entity182 said , is committed to reconciliation and putting an end to divisions that resulted from the coup			2
@entity60 and the coup plotters maintained that @entity58 was trying to remain in power by maneuvering to hold a referendum that ultimately could have allowed him to run again			2
the nation 's congress had outlawed the vote , and the supreme court said it was unconstitutional			0
@entity182 said he hopes the @entity2 report does not blame the new government for the violence			1
but the report bears noting , he said			0
" any allegation of violations of human rights has to be taken very seriously , especially in a country with a history of human rights violations , " @entity182 said			0
" there 's a lot of ad hoc violence , but if there 's organized violence against political supporters of @entity58 , then that is wrong , and it should be condemned			0
" the @entity8 is an autonomous panel created by the @entity2			1
the commission consists of seven independent members who act in a personal capacity , without representing a particular country			0
