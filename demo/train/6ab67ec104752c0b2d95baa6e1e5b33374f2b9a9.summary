-- if you 've seen " @entity4 " or taken a few minutes to really look at your @entity3 page , you may have started to figure out that what you get out of @entity3 and what @entity3 gets out of you are very different things			1
as a @entity11 commenter once said , " if you 're not paying for something , you 're not the customer ; you 're the product being sold			0
" this week , @entity3 acquired the hugely popular 2 - year - old photo - sharing site @entity13 , paying an astounding $ 1 billion			1
even though it was available only on @entity16 devices until last week , @entity13 has attracted 30 million users who upload about 5 millions photos every day			1
with its filters and other features , @entity13 helped make amateur photography a lot better - looking			2
aside from picking up a bunch of snap - happy users who 'll push their @entity13 photos to their @entity3 timelines , what is it that @entity3 really gets from its big purchase ? after all , @entity3 already has smart ways to display pictures , and users are uploading 250 million of them each day			1
so it 's not more pictures that @entity3 needs			2
sure , the deal will help @entity3 get a hook in the mobile market			1
that 's important because @entity16 has n't made it easy for @entity3 to move its empire onto smart phones despite a fairly snazzy app. @entity3 only has to look at the numbers to know that more and more people are doing what @entity47 once referred to as " interpersonal computing " on their handheld devices			1
that 's all good stuff for @entity3			2
but there 's something @entity3 gets from buying @entity13 that could be even more valuable in the long run			1
when you are the product , @entity3 needs to sell you to somebody ; namely , the advertisers			2
it 's a pretty straightforward transaction : someone pays @entity3 and uses the copious and detailed information that @entity3 has gathered about you to stick a targeted message into the " sponsored " message area of your screen when you log in to your account			2
the problem is that right now , most of those ads feel like spam , or at least slightly improved versions of those horrifying ads for miracle creams and belly fat reduction that have been all over @entity74			0
to help make those ads more interesting , @entity3 has come up with something it calls " @entity77			2
" you may have seen them show up			0
they 're your friends ' posts being repurposed as ads and placed straight into the sponsored section of your @entity3 page			0
posts as ads may sound scary , but in a world where we 're constantly being bombarded with advertisements , there 's something almost comforting in knowing that your friends are slowly becoming a more powerful tool for advertising than many of those million - dollar ad agencies pushing @entity96 or insurance policies at you			2
certainly , you 're more likely to care more about the endorsements of your friends than any celebrity , even if it 's @entity102			0
but so far , most of those " @entity77 " are primarily made from words			0
with only a tiny bit of space for a sponsored ad , a picture can be worth a thousand words			0
and here comes @entity13 's role : by allowing people to push their images straight into their @entity3 feeds ( and straight out again as a commercial ) , @entity3 has a unique powerful tool for integrating images in a way that were only dreamed of before			1
how would it work ? imagine that i take a picture of a new @entity121 500 through @entity13 and posted it to my @entity3 timeline along with my text			1
" just saw the new @entity121 500			0
looks cool ! ( like ! ) " @entity3 will want to sell that post back to @entity121 as something the car company can promote on my friends ' pages			0
turning that image into an advertisement means that my endorsement stays on my friends ' pages long after the original post has been topped by other updates			0
because @entity3 usually gets paid only if someone clicks on an ad , this kind of advertisement works to its advantage , since it is way more personal , is way less spammy and adds genuine value to your experience			1
( " @entity143 is into @entity144 ? i 'll have to call him up when i buy mine			0
" ) like it or not , brands are something that have been deeply integrated into the fabric of our lives ( as has @entity3 )			0
@entity3 's success proves that most of us do n't mind sharing our lives directly with our friends			1
after all , it 's a less lonely life when you know that your friends have something to say about everything you do			0
by using @entity13 's images to sell that feeling of personal connection directly to advertisers , founder @entity158 can grow @entity3 's ad revenue while creating a marketing experience that seems more personal and seamless to the users			1
for a company that 's about to go public and already competing head to head against brilliant , powerful businesses like @entity16 and @entity170 , adding the power of images to its mix of personal stories and marketing seems like a smart move			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0
