-- @entity1 is once again a contender in this year 's @entity2 , but off the track he is championing a cause dear to his heart			1
@entity1 , known for hanging an @entity7 flag out his window whenever a victory lap is warranted , started the @entity10 to support anyone who has " sacrificed greatly for @entity7			1
" the foundation centers around the race 2 recovery program , which serves wounded veterans			1
several race weekends a year @entity1 and his foundation , run by former navy lt. @entity17 , work with local @entity19 hospitals to bring vets and their families to the track for a vip experience			1
hospital staff recommends the honorees -- many amputees or in wheelchairs -- as either deserving of special praise or being in need of a morale boost			0
" a lot of our honorees have n't been out of the house in quite some time			0
so it 's a great way to get them out and get them on their feet , " @entity1 says			1
the highlight of the program happens after the race 's final lap. when the grandstands empty out and race crews have headed home , @entity1 gets back behind the wheel for an extra day to give his honorees a once - in - a - lifetime experience -- a high - speed joy ride around the track			1
" i believe in charity in action			2
i think it 's very tempting for some people to maybe write a check and walk away feeling like they 've done their good deed , but at some point somebody actually has to do the good deed , " @entity1 says			2
he gets help from his @entity61 teammate @entity60			0
@entity60 drives a second car for honorees ' family members who also might feel the need for speed			2
" i hope they take a glimpse of what we do but almost at the same time a glimpse of getting away from some tumultuous experience they 've had as a veteran of war , " @entity60 says			0
" and hopefully racing is something that they can become a fan of through this experience and have something to look forward to week in and week out			0
" @entity83 war veteran @entity82 , who was n't a @entity2 fan before the @entity85 connected him to the @entity10 , says @entity1 's program means a lot to him			1
" i think what the @entity10 is doing is incredible -- @entity1 having this organization , inviting veterans out to experience @entity2 events , but not only that			1
here it is , monday			0
he won yesterday 's race			1
he was here this morning with us and driving us around the track , " @entity96 says			0
" he could want to just as easily either still be partying or be back on the road			0
but he 's here with us , and i think that is incredible for all of us veterans to have someone show that much appreciation			2
" one of the foundation 's original honorees , @entity107 , says what @entity1 and his team did for him was so inspiring that he now gives back as a volunteer			1
" it 's changed my whole outlook on everything now			0
it 's so easy to get depressed when you come back and you ca n't do the stuff you used to , " @entity107 says			0
like many of the men and women the foundation serves , @entity107 and @entity96 are around the same age as @entity1 , a fact not lost on the 28 - year - old racer			1
@entity1 says he realizes he could have just as easily been in their place			2
the cause became even more personal when he saw an old friend at @entity128 during @entity2 's tour to support the troops			2
his friend had been injured , and several soldiers in his unit had died in @entity83			0
" he just completely lacked any motivation to live , " @entity1 says of his friend with whom he 'd lost touch			0
" that was probably one of the key moments that made me feel like ... this was a cause that was worth something , to help guys like him get back going			0
" @entity1 adds , " if we can be the difference in one person 's life and prevent them from going through the trials and tribulations that a lot of our veterans have , whether it 's becoming a recluse or worst case , suicide , if we can prevent one of those things from happening , i feel like we 've been a success , and it 's worth the effort			1

@entity2 driver @entity1 's foundation helps those who have served the @entity7
@entity10 's race 2 recovery program honors wounded veterans
honorees spend race weekend as racer 's guest , and he drives around the track at full speed
" i believe in charity in action , " @entity1 says
