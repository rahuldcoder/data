@entity0 -- @entity2 spent the presidential primary campaign trying to convince conservatives of his right - wing credibility on immigration issues			1
he labeled rivals @entity7 and @entity10 gov. @entity9 as soft on illegal immigrants for suggesting some leniency for specific categories , such as students or long - time community members			0
he rejected the @entity16 that would provide a pathway to citizenship for some young illegal immigrants			0
he called part of @entity22 's controversial immigration law a model for the rest of the country			2
now @entity2 's stance of a few months back is under scrutiny as the certain @entity29 presidential nominee seeks support from the mainstream electorate , including the increasingly significant @entity33 population			1
president @entity35 's recent move to halt deportations of some @entity16 - eligible immigrants and monday 's @entity39 ruling against key provisions of the @entity22 law brought fresh attention to immigration issues , causing obvious discomfort in the @entity2 camp			1
analysis : five things we learned from @entity39 ruling the situation requires a delicate political dance , and so far , the former @entity53 governor has appeared determined to sit this one out as much as possible			2
at a campaign event tuesday , @entity2 touched on the topic by faulting @entity35 for failing to enact comprehensive immigration reform , which he said created a " muddle " that @entity22 tried to address with its own law			1
@entity2 said monday that he supported state - based solutions , noting the @entity39 ruling in the @entity22 case went in the other direction , and he promised broad immigration reform if elected president			1
however , he provided no details , leaving his surrogates to struggle with interviewers pushing for specifics on @entity2 's immigration policies			1
@entity71 , the normally tough - talking @entity72 @entity29 leader from @entity73 , sounded subdued tuesday when asked by reporters about his stance on the @entity35 administration 's halt in some deportations			1
" discussions are underway both inside the @entity29 conference and with the ( @entity2 ) campaign about that issue , " @entity83 replied , adding that @entity35 's move had put the topic on the " front burner			1
" he then turned the microphone over to a @entity29 colleague			2
the day before , @entity2 spokesman @entity89 repeatedly stuck to noncommittal responses when grilled for several minutes about the candidate 's stance on a controversial provision in the @entity22 law requiring police to check the immigration status of crime suspects			1
such equivocation concerns republicans seeking more leadership from @entity2 on an issue that resonates with @entity33 voters			1
" i 'm getting increasingly frustrated as a @entity29 @entity33 not seeing him engage , " said @entity103 , a @entity29 strategist and @entity1 contributor			1
@entity35 's failure to deliver on immigration reform in his first term leaves the president vulnerable , @entity105 argued monday night on @entity1 , but only if " @entity2 puts on the gloves and engages			1
" immigration reform : back to square one " for some reason , he 's been unwilling to do so , " @entity105 continued , noting @entity2 " dug himself into a hole during the primaries			1
he 's got to proactively dig himself out of that hole			0
telling us that @entity35 is bad is not enough			2
he 's got to tell us that he 's good and what his plan is			0
" @entity121 rep. @entity121 of @entity22 also advised @entity2 to be more aggressive , saying the candidate should challenge the @entity35 administration 's failure to fully enforce existing immigration laws by halting some deportations and other steps			1
" gov. @entity2 should be up and talking about this and really hammering it home , saying , ' look , we 're a nation of laws , we need to enforce our laws , and we ca n't let the president go around @entity134 and disregard how our legislative process is supposed to work , ' " @entity121 told @entity128 on monday night			2
to @entity136 , @entity2 painted himself into a corner by embracing conservative immigration policies in the primaries to court the political right wing			1
" he can not hug and kiss the tea party and then try to hug and kiss the @entity33 community , " former @entity142 adviser @entity141 told @entity1 monday night			0
" that 's why he 's hiding			0
" the @entity22 case illustrated the differences between the candidates , @entity141 said			0
" what @entity150 was to black folks in the last century , @entity22 has now become " for @entity33 , said @entity141 , who is @entity149			0
" this president is clear			0
he does not agree with the direction of @entity22			0
where is @entity2 ? @entity2 is being a profile in cowardice			0
and he 's losing @entity158 now on both sides of the aisle over his cowardice			0
" @entity162 , a political science professor at @entity163 , cited the stark differences between @entity35 's immigration move versus conservative ideology that opposes any leniency for illegal immigrants			1
" the republicans ca n't win by attacking this policy because they 're attacking people who are innocent of any crime -- just being with their parents , " @entity162 said last week about the administration 's halt in deporting some young immigrants who came to @entity172 as children and were good students or served in the military			0
" how can you support a policy that would break up families ? you ca n't			0
" @entity35 , meanwhile , took a " major , major step toward cementing the bond between the @entity33 community and the @entity136 in an active way " by stopping the deportations , according to @entity162			1
" this could be the single act by @entity35 that brings @entity158 to the polls in record numbers in 2012 , " she said			0
@entity105 , however , said an @entity35 victory in november would not automatically mean further immigration reforms			2
" @entity35 's going to come in , if he wins a second term , as a lame - duck president from day one into a @entity134 that is now a poisoned well " because of his unilateral move to halt some deportations , she said			2
" we have got one candidate , @entity35 , who makes big promises , talks real pretty , and then does n't deliver , " @entity105 added			2
" and then we have got another candidate who talks without saying anything and really not making any specific promises			0
so for @entity158 , it 's not much of a choice			0
" @entity1 's @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report			0
