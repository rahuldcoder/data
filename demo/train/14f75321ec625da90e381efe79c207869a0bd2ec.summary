@entity0 , @entity1 -- it does n't take a social anthropologist to see that @entity1 truly love a lot about @entity7 culture			1
it is evident everywhere , from the popularity of @entity10 and @entity11 to the prevalence of @entity7 music and movies			2
but for all they like about @entity7 culture , it 's fair to say @entity1 are getting a little weary of the @entity7 attitude -- especially when it comes to justice			1
@entity1 point to a number of high - profile cases over the years in which they say @entity7 suspects have been accused of wrongdoing and criminal acts , but have been let off lightly			1
these cases leave @entity1 with the feeling that it 's possible for @entity7 to get away with murder			1
in 1998 , a @entity32 jet on a low - level training flight sliced through steel wires supporting a cable car near the ski resort of @entity37 in the @entity38 , sending a gondola plunging to the ground			1
all 20 people inside the gondola were killed			1
@entity38 prosecutors wanted the crew of the jet tried in @entity1 , but an @entity38 court ruled they should face court - martials in the @entity7 , in accordance with @entity49 treaties			1
the aircraft 's pilot and navigator were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter , even though the military admitted the plane had been flying lower and faster than authorized			0
the defense argued that the incident was a tragic accident caused partly by the fact that the plane 's altimeter was not working and the gondola cable that the plane hit was not on the map that he was given			0
when it emerged a video that captured the accident from inside the plane had been destroyed , they were dismissed from the @entity32			2
@entity1 were outraged , referring to the incident as the " massacre of @entity73			0
" for years , many from the local resort area held anti-american protests on the anniversary of the accident			0
in another incident that raised tensions , @entity80 cleric @entity79 was seized off the streets of @entity84 in 2003 , and smuggled to @entity80 , where he says he was tortured and released four years later			0
although @entity1 did not request the extradition of any of the suspects , 22 @entity86 agents were convicted in absentia of the kidnapping and sentenced to prison time for their role in the abduction , but none ever served time in @entity1			2
they were also ordered to pay $ 1.5 million to @entity79 's family , who have received nothing so far			0
@entity1 were outraged that @entity7 could conduct military - style operations on @entity38 soil , especially involving kidnapping and torture , and go unpunished			1
other cases involving the two nations have been equally controversial			0
in 2009 , @entity7 troops opened fire at a @entity106 airport checkpoint , killing @entity38 secret service agent @entity107 and wounding a just - freed @entity38 hostage , journalist @entity109 , whom @entity107 was trying to spirit out of the country			1
an @entity38 judge acquitted a @entity7 soldier accused of killing @entity107 , saying @entity1 had no jurisdiction in the case , and @entity1 did not request extradition			1
but the case is still a sensitive topic in @entity1 , where @entity107 is considered to be a national hero killed by trigger - happy @entity7			1
the trial of @entity121 student @entity120 , accused of killing her @entity124 roommate @entity122 in november 2007 when the two shared a house in @entity127 , @entity1 , is also controversial			1
timeline : kercher murder case @entity130 and her erstwhile lover @entity131 were famously convicted of @entity134 's murder and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively in 2009			0
that conviction was sensationally overturned in 2011 and @entity130 went back to @entity121			0
the acquittal was then overturned by @entity1 's high court in march 2013 , meaning @entity130 currently stands convicted of @entity134 's murder and her appeal will likely be heard early next year			2
suspects are not required to attend court hearings in @entity1 , so @entity130 does not need to return to stand trial , at least in the short term			2
but if her original conviction is upheld on appeal and confirmed by @entity1 's high court , she would almost certainly face extradition orders to return to @entity1 to serve time for @entity134 's murder			2
it could be years before a final decision is reached in the @entity130 case , and undoubtedly @entity130 's legal team would fight extradition on every level if her conviction is upheld			0
in the meantime , @entity1 assume @entity130 will never set foot in @entity1 again , whether she is ultimately found responsible of @entity134 's murder or not			0
" she will never come back here , whether she should legally or not , " the @entity134 family lawyer @entity162 told @entity2			0
" there are too many case precedents that clearly show @entity7 does not easily surrender its criminals			0
" read more : @entity120 : i wanted to come back from @entity1 stronger and surer of myself read more : what @entity120 can and ca n't tell us read more : @entity120 : i wanted to come back from @entity1 stronger and surer of myself			2

a number of @entity7 suspects in high - profile cases have not been brought to justice , say @entity1
in 1998 , 20 people were killed when a @entity32 jet sliced through steel wires supporting a cable car in the @entity38 @entity38
in 2009 , @entity7 troops opened fire at a @entity106 checkpoint , killing @entity38 secret service agent @entity107
the trial of @entity121 student @entity120 , accused of killing her @entity124 roommate @entity122 is also controversial
