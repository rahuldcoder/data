-- @entity2 and @entity3 host nation @entity1 are on a collision course over whether alcohol should be served in stadiums during the 2014 finals			1
legislation passed by the @entity1 government in 2003 prohibits the sale of all alcohol in football arenas			1
and with beer company @entity14 one of @entity2 's main sponsors for the tournament , this creates a problem for football 's world governing body			1
will @entity23 's new stars shine at @entity24 ? @entity2 has been battling for a change in the @entity1 law , with general secretary @entity27 currently in the @entity29 nation to press for progress on new legislation			2
however , some members of the @entity1 @entity33 are campaigning for the law to remain the same , a situation which is complicating arrangements for the month - long soccer showpiece			0
@entity2 beer battle about cash , not game the situation looks set to rumble on , although @entity2 sent @entity0 a statement saying it believes the law will be changed very soon			0
" the selling of beer in stadiums is part of the fan culture and will also be part of the 2014 @entity3 , " the statement said			1
" it is important to note that the sale of alcohol will be limited to beer only as was done at all previous @entity51			0
" we are confident that we will be able to solve the very few open matters and close the chapter of the 2014 @entity55 by march 2012 , so we can then focus on the operational aspects of staging the @entity57 in 18 months from now and then the 2014 @entity3			2
" the statement continued : " at this point let us stress again that our requirements have not changed since 2007 when president @entity61 signed the government guarantees and are actually the same as we request from any other @entity3 host in past			0
" @entity1 minister for sports @entity65 echoed @entity2 's statement , telling @entity0 : " the @entity3 bill is a compromise the country committed to when it was bidding for hosting the event			1
" it is important to note @entity1 asked to host this event and at the time we agreed with all the requirements			0
our goal was to have the bill approved by end of last year , so in terms of law we are not as far ahead as we are in terms of stadiums			0
" we need to move on and fasten up and i am confident that by march we can complete this			0
" the delay in changing the alcohol legislation is not the first time @entity1 and @entity2 have seemingly been at loggerheads since the five - times @entity3 winners were awarded the tournament			1
the @entity1 government is in dispute with @entity2 over the issue of cut - price tickets for senior citizens and students , while @entity2 has still not received the assurances it was seeking over sponsors having their trademarks protected .			2
