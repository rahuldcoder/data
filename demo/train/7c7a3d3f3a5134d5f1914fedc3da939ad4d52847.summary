-- if @entity2 wanted to get @entity4 's attention , he 's done a pretty good job			1
the @entity8 president 's opinion piece arguing against military intervention in @entity10 , published on the @entity12 ' website late wednesday , set off a flurry of reactions -- some outraged , some impressed , and some just plain bemused			1
@entity16 sen. @entity15 said the piece made him almost want to throw up , and @entity19 speaker @entity18 said he was " insulted			1
" @entity2 said he wrote the article " to speak directly to the @entity4 people and their political leaders			1
" but he appeared to have raised some hackles with the last paragraph in which he disputed the idea of @entity4 exceptionalism			1
it was a reference to president @entity29 's address on tuesday night , in which he said that while @entity4 ca n't be a global cop , it ought to act when in certain situations			1
" that 's what makes us exceptional , " @entity29 said			2
" with humility , but with resolve , let us never lose sight of that essential truth			0
" @entity2 's answer to that ? " it is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional , whatever the motivation , " he wrote			2
world reaction he concluded with the line , " we are all different , but when we ask for the @entity48 's blessings , we must not forget that @entity49 created us equal			0
" the @entity19 shrugged off the fuss around @entity2 's jabs at @entity29 , describing them as " irrelevant			1
" @entity29 himself ignored a question about the op - ed on thursday			1
his chief spokesman , @entity56 , said that @entity2 has a right to his opinion , noting that @entity4 is an exceptional nation			1
@entity19 minority leader @entity59 questioned @entity2 's views on equality			2
" what i found interesting was the closing -- when he says when we pray to @entity49 he judges us all - i do n't know exactly what his words are but he says ` we are all @entity49 's children			0
' i think that 's great			0
i hope it applies to gays and lesbians in @entity8 as well , " @entity59 said			0
@entity2 signed a law earlier this year that bans public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it			2
violators can be fined and , if they are foreigners , deported			0
' @entity80 ' there are others who took issue with @entity2 's view			2
" @entity80 , next time you wan na write a letter to convince @entity4 about something , how about you skip saying we 're not exceptional ? # rude , " tweeted @entity89 , a political consultant in @entity90			2
is the @entity4 really no. 1 ? @entity8 's wars the @entity8 president also annoyed some people by warning against military action without @entity97 approval			1
" man who launched military action in @entity101 and @entity102 without @entity103 say - so says wars without it are illegal ? " tweeted the journalist @entity98			1
a report commissioned by the @entity107 said that @entity101 illegally started the war with @entity8 in 2008 but that the @entity8 response , which involved occupying large parts of @entity101 territory , also violated international law			0
the two wars between @entity8 forces and separatists in @entity102 are widely considered to be internal conflicts			0
some @entity118 users unearthed a previous op - ed that @entity2 wrote for the @entity12 about the @entity102 war in 1999			1
@entity2 , then the prime minister of @entity8 , struck a different tone in which he sought to explain @entity8 's military action			1
" no government can stand idly by when terrorism strikes , " he wrote			0
" it is the solemn duty of all governments to protect their citizens from danger			0
" " not a word on @entity103 or @entity136 or @entity138 law , " @entity132 , a staff writer at @entity133 , commented about the 1999 article			0
( @entity2 mentions the pope in his op - ed this week as being among those opposed to a @entity4 strike against @entity10			1
) @entity144 's stomach turns the overall tone of @entity2 's latest broadside was too much for @entity15 , chairman of the @entity147 , who said he read the article at dinner on wednesday			1
" i almost wanted to vomit , " he said			0
" i worry when someone who came up through the @entity151 tells us what is in our national interests and what is not			0
it really raises the question of how serious the @entity8 proposal is			0
" but plenty of people seemed to think @entity2 had scored points against @entity29			1
" i think it 's sad to see him acting with more common sense and humanity than @entity29 , " said @entity162			2
" @entity2 made a compelling , though disingenuous , case against military strikes			1
its effectiveness shows how badly @entity29 was outmaneuvered , " tweeted @entity169			2
power plays others saw it in less subtle terms			0
" @entity176 diplomatically serves it to pres. @entity29 in the last paragraph			2
ca n't believe the # nytimes ran this , " wrote @entity179			0
for some people , the tension between the two presidents has become a spectacle in its own right			0
" @entity2 plays his next move on our very own @entity12			2
this is almost getting as good as @entity192 , " wrote @entity118 user @ @entity190			0
others said the tone of the article brought to mind some of the famous photos of @entity2 in macho poses			0
" @entity2 wrote his @entity12 op - ed on an @entity200 , shirtless , with hunting knife nearby , " joked @entity198 .			1
