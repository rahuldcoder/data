-- @entity2 restaurateur @entity1 got quite a surprise one morning earlier this month			1
the co-founder of popular @entity2 restaurant @entity5 , @entity1 woke up and logged onto her computer to find a friend had forwarded her multiple images of a second @entity5 restaurant in @entity11			1
in addition , @entity5 's facebook page was filled with enthusiastic inquiries asking if the shop had opened a new branch in @entity11			1
@entity1 looked closely at the pictures online			0
the @entity5 bore the hallmarks of her successful @entity2 eatery			1
it had the same exterior look and feel as the @entity2 shop			2
even the menu , focusing on northeastern @entity5 -- or @entity23 -- cuisine , looked the same			2
opened earlier this month , the @entity11 restaurant had already earned scores of 5/5 stars from six of its eight reviewers on @entity31 , @entity33 's crowd - sourced food forum			1
given that she had no plans to expand her operations to @entity11 , the @entity34 stunned @entity1			2
" it is extremely disappointing to see the restaurant in @entity33 has used not just the @entity5 name , but also our exact logo and font which was designed specially for us , " @entity1 tells @entity0			1
" they have also used a very similar retro - poster theme for their interior and marketing materials , as well as other elements of our interiors , " says @entity1			0
" we feel this is such a disrespect to the hard work and creativity that our own team , graphic designers and local artists have put into @entity57			0
" a collaboration between @entity1 and chef @entity60 , @entity58 gained instant popularity upon its opening in 2013 and has remained one of the hottest no - reservation restaurants in @entity2			1
@entity58 claims no knowledge of original restaurant both the manager and a staff member at the @entity5 tell @entity0 they have no idea about the existence of the @entity71			1
to their knowledge , theirs is the only @entity5 in @entity33 , they say			1
the manager , surnamed @entity76 , said the restaurant 's name and logo are the responsibility of a marketing department manager who was not made available for contact			2
" i 'm surprised that they say they have no idea about @entity58 since the owners have dined at @entity5 [ in @entity2 ] , and in fact had formal meetings with chef @entity60 and owner @entity1 in april this year , expressing their interest in taking the concept to [ mainland @entity33 ] , which was declined , " says @entity83 , a public relations spokesperson for @entity5 in @entity2			1
knockoff 2.0 long known for knockoff smartphones , designer clothing and luxury hangbags , mainland @entity33 's copycat profiteers have in recent years moved into the business of counterfeiting whole shops and brand identities			1
a 2011 blog post depicting the brilliant ripoff of an @entity102 in @entity103 -- which copied nearly every element of the store , including the friendly blue - shirted staff -- went viral , leading to a reported government clampdown			0
some 22 illegal stores were identified and forbidden to use the @entity110 logo			0
@entity58 is n't the first restaurant to suffer the indignity of a mainland knockoff			0
@entity116 cheesecake shop @entity114 found an unlicensed chain of @entity119 bakeries operating in various cities in @entity33 , attracting long queues of gulled fans			2
more than 200 " @entity124 " stores are still operating in @entity33			2
@entity33 restaurants are also imitated			2
after @entity33 president @entity127 was spotted lining up for steamed dumplings at one of @entity132 's @entity131 steamed dumpling chain shops , the store began attracting even longer - than - usual queues ... as well as imitators			1
a qing - feng dumpling shop in @entity136 was discovered shortly thereafter to be operating without a franchise agreement from the original store , nor a proper business license			0
legal recourse though it has n't yet taken action against its imitator , the @entity5 team in @entity2 says it 's seeking legal advice			1
the difficulty in pursuing legal action in @entity33 often stems from lack of awareness about steps needed to protect one 's trademark			0
" generally speaking , a lot of people do n't understand the concept of registering the name of their restaurant or store as a trademark , " says @entity2 - based @entity152 , an intellectual property partner in global law firm @entity154			1
. " even if they understand the concept , they may just have registered their name in the location where they have operations			0
it never occurs to them that there may be people copying their name			0
" and it 's difficult to prove your name is well - known in @entity33 , where the threshold is high , as well			2
" according to dr. @entity178 , an associate professor of law at @entity179 , attaining legal redress in such cases in @entity33 is often difficult			0
" @entity5 can take legal action only if it has registered its trademark in @entity33 , or can prove that its mark is well - known in @entity33 , " dr. @entity152 tells @entity0			1
" otherwise , it has a very slim chance to win and i do not recommend suing			0
" to @entity5 's owners , however , the issue has moral as well as financial implications			0
" we serve authentic @entity23 cuisine and the concept was put together exclusively by myself and @entity1 after a great deal of research and my own experience of having worked and lived in @entity196 , " says chef @entity60			0
" it is upsetting to have someone else ride on the reputation and success that has come from so much hard work , creativity and passion			0
" @entity0 's @entity204 contributed to this report .			0

despite near - identical signage and menu , manager from *replica* @entity5 says he has no knowledge of the original restaurant
in addition to fake luxury goods , copycat shops and restaurants lifting entire brand identities are now found in @entity33
