-- president @entity1 on wednesday announced an initiative he said will give @entity4 - @entity4 students greater access " to a complete and competitive education from the time they 're born all through the time they get a career			1
" speaking wednesday night at a @entity13 gathering in @entity14 , @entity1 said he has issued an executive order establishing the @entity16 , saying , " a higher education in a 21st century can not be a luxury			1
it is a vital necessity that every @entity4 should be able to afford , " he said			2
he added that his administration is " pushing all colleges and universities " to cut their costs			0
the president focused the bulk of his comments on the economy , saying his tax policies and economic plans aim to boost the middle class			0
" we also believe that every entrepreneur should have a chance to start a business , no matter who you are , no matter what you look like , " he said			0
" that 's why we 've helped @entity4 - @entity4 businesses and minority - owned businesses and women - owned businesses gain access to more than $ 7 billion in contracts and financing that allow them to grow and create jobs			1
" a spokeswoman for presumptive @entity50 presidential nominee @entity49 responded to the speech , saying @entity1 has " disappointed " african - americans with his performance on the economy			1
" as black @entity4 , we all take pride in @entity1 's historic election , " said @entity55 , senior communications and coalition adviser for the @entity49 campaign , " but unfortunately his performance as president has not matched that enthusiasm			1
he 's disappointed black small business owners , failed to address rising black unemployment -- which now stands at over 14 % , and is double that among our youth -- and failed to address the widening economic disparity gap			2
" @entity1 's executive order comes in the wake of a new report by the @entity13 's @entity72 that warned the president could lose three key battleground states -- @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 -- if @entity4 voters do n't match their strong turnout of 2008 in this year 's election			1
" @entity4 voters tipped the outcome of the 2008 presidential election in several key states , and are poised to do so again in 2012 , " said the report , titled " @entity84 : impact of african - americans in 2012 " by @entity88 and @entity89			1
" how this will manifest will depend on many things , but one important factor will be whether the extraordinary growth in turnout by @entity4 voters in 2008 will be replicated in 2012 , " the report continued			2
" the 2008 voter turnout rate was driven by historic factors that may not necessarily apply in 2012			0
" the " historic factors " reference was to @entity1 being the nation 's first @entity4 - @entity4 nominee of a major party , with voters having the opportunity in 2008 to make him the nation 's first @entity4 - @entity4 president			1
this time , an economy struggling to recover from a recession that hit @entity4 particularly hard has raised questions about whether @entity1 supporters will have the same fervor as they did four years ago			2
a recent @entity111 showed the president with overwhelming support among registered @entity4 - @entity4 voters , with backing of 89 % , compared with 5 % for certain @entity50 nominee @entity49			1
in 2008 , @entity1 won 95 % of the @entity4 - @entity4 vote , with 4 % voting for @entity50 candidate @entity117			1
about 2 million more african - americans voted in the 2008 election than in 2004 , according to @entity121 figures			0
voting by all minority groups accounted for nearly all the increase in turnout ( 5 million ) between the two election cycles , as white @entity123 voting was virtually unchanged , the @entity121 reported			0
a decline in @entity4 voter turnout to the 2004 level of 60 % from the 2008 level of 64.7 % would cause @entity1 to lose in @entity76 and possibly lose in @entity77 and @entity75 , according to the @entity134 report			2
@entity1 won all three states in 2008 , and most scenarios for @entity1 's re-election depend on him winning at least two of them this time			2
@entity77 has 18 electoral votes , while @entity76 has 15 and @entity75 has 13			0
a fierce start to the election campaign , with the candidates and their supporting super pacs launching bitter attacks , has made ensuring enthusiastic backing from traditional support bases a key to victory in november			0
the president 's speech wednesday concluded a four - day , six - state swing that started earlier than planned sunday so he could visit @entity154 , @entity155 , after last week 's mass shooting at a movie theater			0
during the speech , @entity1 made some of the most forceful statements of his presidency on the issue of gun violence , saying that while he respects the nation 's hunting and gun - owning traditions , " we should leave no stone unturned and recognize that we have no greater mission as a country than keeping our young people safe			0
" @entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
