-- actor and director @entity1 appears to be at it again			1
this time the issue is not a tirade berating @entity6 and women in front of police officers			1
instead , it 's an outrageous message that was apparently left on his girlfriend 's answering machine and likely was never supposed to come under public scrutiny			2
the despicable message ended with the voice of someone purported to be @entity1 telling his girlfriend that her dress was so provocative , she was likely to be " gang - raped by a bunch of n * * * * * s. " the audio recording , one of several , appeared on the website @entity26			1
( @entity0 can not independently confirm the authenticity of the tapes			0
) let 's set aside for the moment whatever @entity1 's psychological issues may be			1
of even more concern are what such " behind the scenes " remarks can tell us about ourselves and our culture			0
@entity38 , so anxious to believe that we have entered into a " post-racial era , " tend to ignore the one element needed to corroborate such a conclusion : a lack of racial animus			2
clearly over the last 40 years , our laws have greatly mitigated once commonplace displays of racism			1
it is rare that the n - word gets dropped publicly in a racially charged situation ; again @entity1 's conversation was meant to be private			1
in @entity56 's institutions , where there is great awareness of the legal implications , overt forms of discrimination are far less frequently seen than before			1
the country has made real progress			0
but it would be naive to imagine that racism has disappeared with the ascent of an @entity38 to the @entity64			2
the reality is that racism is very alive today			2
it has simply morphed into a more dangerous , odious and insidious form			0
in fact , 21st - century @entity56 racism looks and sounds precisely like the alleged @entity1 recording			1
once upon a time a man with such evident racial prejudices would probably have owned slaves and used racial epithets publicly , with complete impunity			2
moved by a combination of fear of legal action , political correctness and pure cowardice , the prejudiced have gone behind closed doors			0
in place of public promulgations and actions that would clearly identify someone like @entity1 as the person he really is , a man like this conveys his innermost beliefs to his girlfriend			1
instead of negative sentiments about african - americans being expressed directly to a black man 's face , they 're expressed in private and taught to children , family and others who can be influenced to hate			2
this 21st - century form of racism is running rampant in our society and it is more difficult to combat than its 20th - century cousin			1
by day , the prejudiced cordially converse and interact with people of all backgrounds and ethnicities			0
but by night , they espouse racial hatred in closeted , private circles			2
in the past there was something liberating in at least being able to identify those who were the real racists			0
i am not longing for a return to the days of old @entity56 when @entity38 like @entity117 died because they looked at another person on the street			1
however , today there are many of us who might rather have someone call us the n - word out loud than have them smile in our faces			0
so what am i looking for ? first , an acknowledgement that racism is still all around us			0
we can not fight a problem that we do not even believe exists			0
second , and even more importantly , we must quickly acknowledge the modern era of race relations in @entity56 and build a new , comprehensive set of strategies and approaches to combat this different manifestation of prejudice			1
there are many in the military who acknowledge that the tactics used for 20th - century warfare are not effective against the threats in this century			0
conventional weaponry can not succeed against determined terrorists who successfully melt into the civilian population			0
by analogy , we need to understand the profound metamorphosis of @entity56 racism and construct new " weaponry " to combat it			1
this reality has practical and policy implications			0
just as we must convince people in @entity154 of the virtues of a free society to stanch the spread of terrorism , we must focus on convincing the next generation of @entity38 that diversity is a great asset to be embraced , not a liability to be feared			0
open discussions and dialogues about race are required			0
they must be built more frequently into the curriculums of our schools and promoted by reasonable minds and organizations			0
leveraging the incredible strength of our nation 's diversity -- or failing to do so -- will not only have implications for our social justice and peace internally , it will also be the single most important element defining the @entity56 ' global stature			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			1

@entity181 says in recordings released , @entity1 purportedly had racially *offensive* tirade
the recordings , he says , should alert us to 21st century 's sub rosa racial *hostility* in @entity56
laws , societal pressure may have *damped* open racism , but it persists privately , he says
@entity181 : @entity196 must push back *aggressively* at racism by educating next generation
