-- for a serious distance runner , 7 hours , 48 minutes is not a great marathon time			2
but cut @entity3 some slack			1
he 'd been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma -- a rare soft - tissue cancer -- in his lung			1
he was in his fourth cycle of chemotherapy			2
and he was dragging an iv pole for all 26.2 miles			1
oh , and this marathon was taking place in a hospital hallway			2
when @entity3 started coughing up blood in february 2005 , he was an active 47 - year - old who jogged regularly and once finished the @entity16 in a respectable 3 hours , 19 minutes			1
life was good for the father of four and senior partner with consulting giant @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			2
he had recently gained a small but devout following after co-authoring " @entity29 " with @entity24 and @entity25 , a book that espoused the benefits of straight talk			2
he appeared on cable news shows and wrote op - ed pieces , and his work was the subject of a clue on " @entity35 ! " then came the news nobody is prepared to hear			0
" i have been diagnosed with a form of cancer called synovial sarcoma , " @entity3 wrote friends and colleagues in 2005			1
" although this usually shows up in and around the joints , mine appears to be in my lung			0
i am having surgery to remove my lower left lobe , where the tumor has hunkered down			0
we 're going in for a full assault			0
" the assault began at @entity50 , where doctors removed @entity3 's lung - lobe as planned			1
next up : chemotherapy at @entity54			0
@entity55 when he first drifted into the oncology floor hallway , he did n't set out to complete a marathon			0
originally he was just trying to keep himself from going stir crazy during chemo , which came with a few complications , including a blood clot , pneumonia and anemia			0
@entity3 had been reading @entity67 's " it 's not about the bike : my @entity68 , " which stressed how important it was to " keep moving			1
" " so , i started moving , " @entity3 said			1
" i did one , then two , then three , then four , then five laps			2
then i started measuring the distance of a lap around the cancer ward and figured out it would take 144 laps to do a marathon			1
" so then i figured , why not ? " @entity3 called his hallway odyssey the " @entity55 , " borrowing a line from @entity78			1
( " life is like a box of chocolates			0
you never know what you 're gon na get			0
" ) " i want to show other chemo patients that you do n't have to accept the notion of lying in bed all day getting liquid drano pumped into you , " @entity3 said the week of the marathon			1
" well , you do need to get the liquid drano -- you just do n't need to take it lying down			2
" when friends , colleagues and hospital staff members learned of the marathon , they wanted to help			2
many wrote or called to offer their support			0
some walked alongside @entity3 , and lots of people opened their wallets			1
those 144 laps raised $ 42,000 for the @entity103			1
his feat even landed him in @entity106 's " @entity105 " that october			0
keep moving , indeed five years later , @entity3 is cancer free			1
but he 's continued to heed @entity67 's advice			0
in april 2009 , @entity3 and a friend ran the @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity22			1
they dubbed their performance " @entity114 " and raised $ 31,600 for sarcoma research			1
and earlier this month , he entered the @entity118 100 mile @entity117			0
" i am attempting to win the ' over 50 , @entity121 ' category , " he joked before the event			0
it took him 23 hours , 45 minutes , but he finished			0
after the race , @entity3 was too tired to talk about the future			2
but there 's little doubt whatever he has planned will make the rest of us exhausted when he does tell us			0
