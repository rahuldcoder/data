-- more than one in 10 women develops depression during pregnancy			0
now , a new study suggests that women who are treated with antidepressants are more likely to give birth early or to have newborns that need to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit			1
babies of women taking @entity14 were born earlier and were more likely to have been admitted to intensive care			1
depression itself can have ill effects for both mom and baby			2
therefore , the benefits of the antidepressants -- known as selective serotonin - reuptake inhibitors -- may still outweigh the risks for some women , researchers say			2
" there is no easy way out of this , " says dr. @entity26 , a developmental pediatrician at @entity27 , in @entity28 , @entity29 , who has studied the effects of @entity14 on children exposed in the womb , but was not involved in the current study			1
" @entity38 needs to be managed , and for some women , the use of these medications is appropriate and necessary			0
" @entity0 : 3 signs you should stop , adjust , or switch antidepressants the new study , led by dr. @entity46 , of @entity47 , in @entity48 , found that babies whose mothers had taken ssris were born earlier and were more likely to require treatment in an @entity53			1
women have been using @entity14 during pregnancy since the early 1990s , @entity46 and her colleagues point out in the report , which is published in the october issue of @entity59			1
these drugs , which include @entity61 , @entity62 , and others , are widely considered to be the safest type of antidepressant medication to take during pregnancy			0
it 's been difficult to confirm their safety , however , especially since investigators have to find a way to distinguish between the effects of depression itself -- and habits that depressed women may be more likely to engage in , like drinking and smoking -- and the drug on the newborn			1
@entity0 : do pregnancy and bipolar disorder mix ? @entity46 and her colleagues tackled this issue by including a group of women who reported a history of some type of psychiatric illness but were n't taking @entity14			1
some , but not all , of these women had suffered from depression			0
" using this group as a comparison group takes into account possible genetic or lifestyle factors associated with present or previous psychiatric disorders , " the researcher notes			0
the analysis included 329 women who took ssris in pregnancy , 4,902 with a history of psychiatric illness who were n't taking the drugs , and 51,770 women who reported no history of psychiatric illness and were n't taking @entity14			2
all had received prenatal care at @entity110 between 1989 and 2006			0
babies of women taking @entity14 were born an average of five days earlier than those born to women who had no mental illness , and were twice as likely to be born preterm			1
the babies whose mothers took @entity14 were 2.4 times as likely to have been admitted to the @entity53 than infants who had n't been exposed to the drugs in utero			1
they were also more than four times as likely to have @entity126 scores below eight , just five minutes after birth			2
( @entity126 scores measure an infant 's health at birth by looking at his or her breathing , heartbeat , reflexes , muscle tone , and skin color ; scores of seven and above are considered normal , and a newborn 's @entity126 score has no influence on how he or she will fare later in life			2
) there was no difference between @entity14 - exposed babies and unexposed babies in head circumference or birth weight			1
antidepressant medication is just one part of the equation in addressing women 's mental health during pregnancy , notes @entity26 , who says depression in pregnancy is a " huge public health issue " with lasting implications for women and their children			2
helping ensure that women are getting enough social support and adequate nutrition is essential , he adds , while alternative treatments for depression -- such as exercise , light therapy , and omega - 3 fatty acids -- ought to be explored further			0
" in general , optimizing non-pharmacological treatment would be a really important step , " he says			0
he explains that it is essential to follow @entity14 - exposed babies as they grow up , to identify any problems and intervene as necessary			1
however , he and @entity46 agree that it 's still unclear whether the differences seen at birth will have lasting effects on a child 's development and health			1
@entity0 : 6 rules for a healthy postpartum slim - down " as depression itself can influence birth outcome in a negative direction , treatment is warranted in some cases based on the existing body of evidence , " @entity46 says			0
" in cases with mild or moderate symptoms , psychotherapy can be used as an alternative treatment			0
in severe cases and in patients with a history of recurrent , severe depression , continuation or initiation of treatment might be the best option			0
" every single case should be considered individually , and the decision should be made by the woman and her ob - gyn and psychiatrist , " she says			0
