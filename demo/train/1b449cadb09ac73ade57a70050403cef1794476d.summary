-- from teary - eyed teenager to the proud owner of a green jacket , @entity2 's transformation from best of the rest to major winner has involved a fair amount of heartache			1
the newly - crowned @entity10 champion watched on television as his hero and fellow @entity14 @entity13 threw away a six - shot lead at @entity16 in 1996 , while @entity2 himself blew a four - shot advantage over the final four holes of last year 's @entity19			1
but there was no collapse , no choking on sunday			0
the new world @entity22 showed nerves of steel to defeat overnight co-leader @entity26 in a tense two - hole playoff to win the first major of 2013			1
" the whole nation stopped that day and felt for @entity13 , " @entity2 told @entity0 when asked about @entity13 's implosion on april 14 , 1996			1
the tale of @entity32 : masters social media reaction " it was so hard to see your hero not come up with the goods that day like he normally always did			2
i learned lessons out of that day			0
" it 's an amazing journey , the whole golfing career			2
i 've played a lot of majors and to finally get one means a lot			0
i 've knocked on the door a couple of times recently , to get over the hurdle is hopefully the start of something to come			0
" @entity2 has flirted with major success on a number of occasions			2
he finished third at the 2006 @entity53 before tying for second at the @entity10 two years ago , with his final - round collapse at @entity56 and @entity57 in 2012 was the closest he had got to winning one of the sport 's four blue riband events , letting the @entity62 slip from his grasp and into @entity65 ' hands			1
now , @entity2 is @entity14 's first @entity2 champion , succeeding where two - time major winner @entity13 and the great @entity66 failed			1
" @entity68 is a game that can humble you very quickly , and it certainly did at the @entity19 , " continued the 32 - year - old			1
" but i 've won tournaments before and i 've lost tournaments before and it 's going to keep happening for the rest of my life			0
as much as i do n't want to lose tournaments , it 's inevitable			2
" the @entity19 gave me more belief than anything			2
no doubt , it just gave me more belief that i am good enough to win a major championship			0
" @entity2 looked to have done enough for victory when he holed an impressive birdie on the 72nd hole of the weekend to move to nine - under par and into the outright lead			1
but @entity26 , who held a share of the lead heading into sunday , responded with a sublime approach shot to the final green and a playoff was required			1
@entity2 eventually emerged victorious on the second playoff hole , the par - four 10th , fulfilling the dreams of the 15 - year - old who watched @entity13 's infamous capitulation			1
" it 's quite a feeling to make a couple of putts to win a tournament , " he said			0
" it 's what every kid dreams about			0
for it to finally happen is amazing			0
" the @entity105 native becomes the latest player to win a major using the controversial belly putter			0
@entity65 ' victory over @entity2 was achieved using the club , while @entity111 and @entity112 both belly putted their way to major championships			2
that putter , which involves golfers anchoring the club to any part of the body , has divided golf in recent months			0
the @entity122 and the @entity123 , backed by the @entity124 , has proposed banning anchored putting from 2016 onwards , a move opposed by the @entity53 and the @entity127			0
for now though , @entity2 has time to savor his win at @entity16 , while golf 's regulators come up with a belly putter solution .			1
