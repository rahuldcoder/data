-- a day after fall shrimping season began in the @entity2 and the state of @entity4 reopened coastal waters to fishing , a major environmental watchdog group called for more stringent testing of seafood			1
the @entity10 released a statement tuesday saying it sent letters to the @entity13 and the @entity14 , co-signed by almost two dozen @entity16 groups , asking the government agencies to : -- ensure that there is comprehensive monitoring of seafood contamination			1
-- ensure public disclosure of all seafood monitoring data and methods			2
-- ensure that fishery re-opening criteria protect the most vulnerable populations , including children , pregnant women and subsistence fishing communities			0
" with the opening of shrimping season and near - daily reopening of fishing areas , seafood safety is a major issue right now , " dr. @entity30 , a senior scientist with the @entity10 , said in the statement			1
" the government needs to show it is putting strong safety criteria and testing standards in place to ensure that the seafood from the @entity2 will be safe to eat in the months and years to come			1
" government officials including vice president @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity14 's chief scientist for fisheries , have said in recent weeks that waters closed to fishermen after the worst oil spill in @entity52 history would be reopened when officials could guarantee that seafood would pass tests for safety and edibility			1
the @entity59 disaster has hampered the seafood business across the @entity2 as federal and state authorities put much of its waters off - limits amid safety concerns			1
with the once - gushing well capped on a temporary basis for more than a month now , @entity14 and the @entity16 have begun lifting those restrictions -- but @entity68 shrimpers such as @entity69 say more needs to be done , and soon			0
" it 's open down over here with small shrimp , where it should be open over there where the big shrimp are , " @entity69 said			2
" ca n't make no money with no little shrimp , man			0
" @entity69 said he planned to go out , because " i ai n't made nothing since the @entity82 spill			0
" but he was concerned that inspectors might find signs of oil in his catch and make him dump it			2
" so why go out there and catch it if they 're just going to be dumped , and i ai n't going to make no money off it ? " he asked			0
" i 've got to make money			0
i 've got four grandkids i 'm raising			0
" @entity95 , a spokeswoman for the @entity96 , said it will probably take days to assess what impact the spill has had on the @entity2 catch			1
and while some shrimpers are eager to get back out , many are still working for the well 's owner , @entity82 , which has hired many boats to skim oil off the surface and lay protective booms along the shorelines			2
two reports published tuesday express concern about the lingering effects of oil spilled from the ruptured @entity82 well into the @entity2			1
a team from @entity116 and the @entity117 released a report that estimates that 70 to 79 percent of the oil that gushed from the well " has not been recovered and remains a threat to the ecosystem , " the university said in a release			1
meanwhile , researchers at the @entity124 have concluded that oil from the @entity59 spill may have settled to the bottom of the @entity2 farther east than previously suspected -- and at levels toxic to marine life			1
their study is to be released tuesday , as well , but @entity0 obtained a summary of the initial conclusions monday night			0
initial findings from a new survey of the @entity2 conclude that dispersants may have sent droplets of crude to the ocean floor , where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the @entity143 , the @entity124 team said			1
plankton and other organisms at the base of the food chain showed a " strong toxic response " to the crude , and the oil could resurface later , according to researchers			2
" the dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters , where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life , " said @entity152 , a marine microbiologist at the @entity124			1
the @entity117 study " strongly contradicts " a 2 - week - old government report saying that only 26 percent of the oil spilled from the well remains in the @entity2			1
" that is just absolutely incorrect in the opinion of the scientists , " @entity164 , the director of @entity116 and a professor of marine sciences at the @entity117 , said tuesday			2
the government said 4.9 million barrels -- 205.8 million gallons -- of oil leaked into the @entity2 , and 74 percent of that oil had been collected or dispersed or had evaporated			1
of the remaining 26 percent , " much of that is in the process of being degraded and cleaned up on the shore , " @entity14 head @entity174 said august 4			2
but the @entity117 study said the government 's numbers were skewed for several reasons			1
first , because 800,000 barrels of oil were collected from the well before it could spill into the @entity2 , the @entity117 researchers said a total of 4.1 million barrels spilled into the water			1
but other factors mean more of that oil remains in the water , they said			1
in addition , the @entity117 researchers used a fundamentally different definition of when oil is " gone " from the water			1
" one major misconception is that oil that has dissolved into water is gone and , therefore , harmless , " @entity164 said			2
" the oil is still out there , and it will likely take years to completely degrade			2
" and that oil is a lot harder to see than the huge clumps that dotted the @entity2 's face like black and brown acne weeks ago			1
@entity207 , another professor of marine sciences at the @entity117 , said that naturally dispersed oil was forming plumes in the water -- but " not black , not brown , turbid sea water			1
you do n't need a river of oil			2
it 's oil that 's dissolved in water			1
" @entity207 stressed that the government also had completely omitted a crucial component of the environmental pollution from its statistics			2
she said @entity14 did not measure a third of the hydrocarbons because it did not measure gas emission , which she says are " mostly still in water floating somewhere out there			0
... methane and other gases are n't being documented			0
" the spill began after an april 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform @entity59 that killed 11 men			0
two days later , the platform sank and started gushing oil into the @entity2 before it was temporarily capped july 15			1
@entity235 , the federal government 's point man for the disaster , said monday that attempts to permanently seal the well wo n't start until the latest potential problem is evaluated			1
@entity235 said engineers are now concerned about how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus , a ring that surrounds the casing pipe at the center of the well shaft			0
the " timelines wo n't be known until we get a recommendation on the course of action , " @entity235 said			0
scientists began new pressure tests last week to gauge the effects of the mud and cement poured into the well from above during the " static kill " procedure that started august 3			0
from those pressure readings , they believe that either some of the cement breached the casing pipe and leaked into the annulus , or cement came up into the annulus from the bottom			0
the scientists believe that process may have trapped some oil between the cement and the top of the well , inside the annulus			0
now , given that new variable , they 're trying to figure out how to safely maintain the pressure within the well before launching the " bottom kill , " a procedure aimed at sealing the well from below			0
@entity235 said that when it comes to giving a green light to the bottom kill of the well through the nearby relief well , " nobody wants to make that declaration any more than i do			0
" but the process " will not start until we figure out how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus			0
" " we 're using an overabundance of caution , " he said			0
@entity235 said crews could remove the capping stack that sealed the oil in the well july 15and then replace the well 's blowout preventer with one stored on the nearby @entity296 in the @entity2			1
he said a new blowout preventer would be " rated at much higher pressure levels than the annulus			0
" the other option would require @entity82 to devise a pressure - relief device for the current capping stack			0
once crews get their marching orders , it will take them about 96 hours to prepare , drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well			0
then , the bottom kill process of plugging the well from below would begin			0
@entity0 's @entity314 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			2

new : the @entity10 calls for *improved* seafood testing
reports cast doubt on the government 's estimate of oil remaining in the water
@entity117 report says more oil remains in the @entity2 than the government has said
a @entity124 report says the oil may be farther east than first thought
