-- @entity2 's gala address before @entity4 parliamentarians and officials tuesday surprised no one when he announced @entity4 's annexation of @entity8			1
the interesting part was his distorted view of @entity4 history , and his proclamation that a bizarre kind of simultaneously aggrieved and aggressive hyper - nationalism is now @entity4 's official ideology			1
in discussing @entity16 , however , @entity2 seemed to go out of his way to suggest he had no aggressive intentions and was not planning to divide the rest of the country			1
listening to @entity2 , one could easily forget that @entity4 is and for many centuries has been the largest country in the world and that it acquired its territories by imperialist expansion often accompanied by genocide and ethnic cleansing			1
instead , @entity2 prefers to see @entity4 as having been permanently on the defensive , a victim of both @entity31 and @entity32 machinations : " in a word , we have all the reasons to believe that the notorious policy of containing @entity4 , which was pursued in the 18th , 19th and 20th centuries , is continuing to this day			1
" they are constantly trying to drive us into some corner , because we have an independent position , because we defend it , and because we call things by their names and are not hypocrites , " he said			0
after the @entity45 , according to @entity2 , it was the turn of the @entity46 to aggrieve @entity4			1
@entity2 conveniently ignores that the vast majority of @entity46 were @entity4 and that the party @entity49 founded was institutionally @entity4 as well			1
@entity2 says : " the @entity46 , for a number of reasons -- may @entity51 judge them -- added large sections of the historical @entity56 to the @entity57			2
this was done with no consideration for the ethnic makeup of the population , and today these areas form the southeast of @entity16			2
then , in 1954 , a decision was made to transfer @entity65 to @entity16			2
... what matters now is that this decision was made in clear violation of the constitutional norms that were in place even then			0
" once again , @entity2 's historical myopia is breathtaking : @entity72 's decision to grant @entity8 to @entity16 was as constitutional as anything any @entity75 @entity32 leader did in the entire period of the @entity75 's existence			1
the @entity75 rested on illegality and the systemic violation of human and civil rights			0
if @entity72 was wrong , then that 's only because the @entity75 was wrong and should never have been created in the first place			0
unsurprisingly , there is no room in this narrative for the nation that @entity4 imperialism almost managed to annihilate -- the @entity88			2
@entity4 conquered the @entity89 in 1783			2
afterward , the @entity4 authorities forced the @entity91 out of their ancestral homeland and replaced them with settlers from @entity4			2
tens of thousands of @entity91 died or were killed ; some two - thirds had to leave the @entity8			0
in 1944 , the ethnic cleansing was completed when @entity97 expelled the entire @entity89 population -- about 200,000 people -- to @entity100 and some other @entity75 regions			0
about half died on the way			0
it was only in the late 1980s that they began returning to their homeland to find that their land and their homes had been occupied by @entity4 settlers			2
instead , @entity2 primarily explains why @entity8 matters to @entity4 : " the graves of @entity4 soldiers whose bravery brought @entity8 into the @entity4 empire are also in @entity8			1
this is also @entity117 -- a legendary city with an outstanding history , a fortress that serves as the birthplace of @entity4 's @entity121 ... symbolizing @entity4 military glory and outstanding valor			1
" and what of the @entity88 ? here 's @entity2 : " true , there was a time when @entity88 were treated unfairly , just as a number of other peoples in the @entity75			2
there is only one thing i can say here : millions of people of various ethnicities suffered during those repressions , and primarily @entity4			0
" the mendacity is astounding			0
the @entity88 were not just " treated unfairly " by some vague force			0
they were subjected to genocide by a @entity4 totalitarian empire			0
@entity4 also " suffered , " but the brunt of the suffering fell , as @entity142 historian @entity141 describes in " @entity143 , " on @entity144 and @entity16			1
despite all this victimization , @entity2 's speech loudly asserts that @entity4 is back : it 's mad as hell and it wo n't take being humiliated anymore			1
this @entity4 , the new @entity4 , is both victim and bully : " today it is imperative to end the hysterics and to renounce the rhetoric of the ' @entity153 , ' and to recognize an obvious thing : @entity4 is an independent and active participant in international life , and it has , like other countries , its national interests , which must be acknowledged and respected			1
" and then , remarkably , @entity2 adopts a conciliatory tone with respect to @entity16			1
naturally , he first denounces the new democratic government as illegitimate and in the thrall of imaginary fascists and asserts @entity4 's obligation to help defend @entity4 and @entity4 speakers from their supposed assaults and predations			0
here 's the soft and fuzzy @entity2 : " i appeal to the people of @entity16			1
i sincerely want you to understand us : under no conditions do we wish to bring you harm , to insult your national feelings			0
we have always respected the territorial integrity of the @entity16 state			0
... " do n't believe those who terrify you with @entity4 , who shout that other regions will follow @entity8			0
... we want @entity16 to be a strong , sovereign and self - sufficient state			0
... we want peace and amity to come to the land of @entity16 , and together with other countries we are ready to provide full cooperation and support to that end			2
but i repeat : only the citizens of @entity16 are able to bring order to their own home			0
" if these words were sincere , then they may mark a significant departure from the war - mongering rhetoric @entity2 employed at his march 4 press conference , where he stated he " was n't worried " by war with @entity16			1
indeed , if sincere , @entity2 has clearly stated that he will not invade the rest of @entity16 and attempt to annex some of its southeastern provinces			1
is @entity2 being truthful , or is the speech a smoke screen for further aggression ? we do n't know , of course , but now that @entity2 has gone on record as having nothing but peaceful intentions toward @entity16 , the international community would do well to remind him of that whenever the temptation to rattle sabers on @entity16 's borders and foment trouble in @entity16 's southeast proves too strong for him to resist			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			0

@entity220 : @entity2 describes both an aggrieved and aggressive @entity4
@entity220 : he *rewrites* history , *portraying* @entity4 as a victim of the @entity31 and @entity32
@entity220 : @entity2 says @entity4 has the right to be a bully , dismisses its previous abuses
@entity220 : @entity31 must hold him to his statements that he wants peace with @entity16
