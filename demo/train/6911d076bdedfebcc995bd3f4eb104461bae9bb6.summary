a judge on wednesday ordered that @entity1 -- who drove drunk and caused a crash , killing four people and injuring two -- go to a lock - down residential treatment facility			1
state district judge @entity6 had already decided the @entity8 teenager would serve no jail time			1
he was sentenced last year to 10 years ' probation			1
his story made national headlines after a witness claimed @entity1 was a victim of " affluenza " -- the product of wealthy , privileged parents who never set limits for the boy			1
that particular defense , however , played no part in the judge 's decision , @entity1 's lawyer told reporters on wednesday			1
court proceedings were closed to the public			2
" she ( @entity6 ) said it ( affluenza ) , and specifically mentioned that that was not a basis for her decision , " said attorney @entity27			0
" she heard all the evidence and she made what she thought was the appropriate disposition			0
" ' @entity37 ' defense psychologist : ' i wish i had n't used that term ' the judge ordered that @entity1 's parents pay for the treatment facility , which was not identified			1
it was also unclear how long @entity1 might stay there			1
as part of his probation , the teen must refrain from using drugs or alcohol			1
he will also not be allowed to drive			0
if @entity1 violates the terms of his probation , he could face up to 10 years behind bars			1
" i think he can be rehabilitated given intensive therapy and i hope that he gets it , " @entity52 said about the teen			2
" the juvenile system is about rehabilitation and if it 's going to be about rehabilitation , she ( @entity6 ) absolutely made the right decision			2
" @entity61 , who lost his wife and daughter in the crash , disagrees			0
he told reporters he has no doubt that money played a role in the case			0
steering teen drivers out of harm 's way " had he ( @entity1 ) not had money to have the defense there , to also have the experts testify , and also offer to pay for the treatment , i think the results would have been different , " he said wednesday after the proceedings			1
last june , his wife , @entity82 , and daughter , @entity84 , left their home to help @entity87 , whose suv had broken down			0
@entity89 , a youth pastor , was driving past and also stopped to help			0
all four were killed when the teen 's pickup plowed into the pedestrians on a road in @entity95 , south of @entity96			1
@entity1 's vehicle also struck a parked car , which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction			1
opinion : ' @entity37 ' is n't as crazy as it sounds two people riding in the bed of the teen 's pickup were tossed in the crash and severely injured			1
one is no longer able to move or talk because of a brain injury , while the other suffered internal injuries and broken bones			0
according to prosecutors , three hours after the crash , tests showed @entity1 had a blood alcohol content of 0.24 , three times the legal limit			2
" there has been nothing from @entity1 from these proceedings with regards to remorse on his part at all -- that i do think would have helped			2
it would have helped the victims			0
no doubt about it , it would have helped , " said @entity61			0
prosecutors were similarly disappointed with the judge 's decision			2
they had asked for the maximum of 20 years behind bars			2
" this has been a very frustrating experience for me , " said prosecutor @entity132			0
" i 'm used to a system where the victims have a voice and their needs are strongly considered			0
the way the system down here is currently handled , the way the law is , almost all the focus is on the offender			0
" ' affluenza ' : is it real ?			0

the lock - down residential treatment facility is not identified
the teen 's family will foot the bill
@entity1 was sentenced to 10 years ' probation but no jail time
