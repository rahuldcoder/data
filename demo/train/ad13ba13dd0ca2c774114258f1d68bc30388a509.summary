@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 @entity4 has assured pageant officials that a lingerie modeling photo published online this week is the only one she posed for , the state pageant director said			1
@entity5 @entity4 may lose her crown because of some semi-nude photos she appeared in			1
but the web site that published the first picture said it has several more that it will " slowly roll out " starting wednesday afternoon			1
the possibility that racier images could emerge prompted " closed - door meetings " tuesday to consider stripping @entity4 of her beauty queen title , pageant spokesman @entity13 said			2
although @entity13 said @entity4 " breached her contract " by keeping the semi-nude photo or photos a secret , the only picture published so far appears about as revealing as the bikini @entity4 wore in the pageant 's swimsuit competition			1
" we have been told by @entity4 there are no other photos other than the one circulating in existence			2
she should know better than anyone , " @entity5 director @entity31 said wednesday			2
the 21 - year - old @entity34 contestant has been the center of controversy since she declared her opposition to same - sex marriage in a response to a question on the national pageant stage last month			1
she finished as runner - up to @entity34			0
in a statement given to @entity2 tuesday , @entity4 said the photos -- and she did use the plural -- were being used in a " vicious and mean - spirited " effort to silence her for " defending traditional marriage			1
" while she vowed to " continue to support and defend marriage as the honorable institution it is , " @entity4 may be doing so without the @entity5 title			1
state pageant officials met tuesday with lawyers and representatives of @entity55 , who owns the international competition , to consider if they had grounds to take the crown away from @entity4 , according to @entity13			0
" when you compete for @entity5 , you 're supposed to disclose whether you posed for nude or semi-nude photos because it 's grounds for disqualification , " he said			1
@entity2 obtained a copy of the pageant contract @entity4 signed last year in which she agreed that the discovery of semi-nude photos could mean disqualification			1
the only photo made public shows @entity4 -- who said she was 17 at the time -- wearing pink panties and no top			2
she is turned away from the camera , with her arm hiding most of her breast			0
it was unclear if pageant officials would consider this a semi-nude photo , in light of their standard requirement that contestants parade across stage wearing a bikini that arguably shows more bare skin			1
but the other shoe -- or other garment -- may be yet to drop			0
@entity90 -- of @entity91 -- said he has waited for an upgrade of his web site 's servers to handle the flood of traffic he expects will come after he posts the additional photos			1
" i will slowly roll these out , " @entity90 said			1
the next image will likely be published wednesday afternoon , he said			0
" we 'll see what happens with those and we want to know who 's releasing them , " @entity13 said			0
@entity105 , the co-executive director of the @entity5 organization , will meet with @entity107 , the runner - up for the title , " to discuss the possible next steps , " @entity13 said			2
@entity4 defended the photos , which she said were taken when she was a teenager aspiring to be a @entity114 's @entity113 model			2
" i am a @entity115 , and i am a model , " she said			0
" models pose for pictures , including lingerie and swimwear photos			0
" she said the photos " have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid web site that openly mocks me for my @entity115 faith			1
" " i am not perfect , and i will never claim to be , " she said			0
" but these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive			0
while we may not agree on every issue , we should show respect for others ' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean - spirited attacks			0
" her publicist , @entity135 , confirmed a comment she gave to celebrity web site @entity137 in which she said @entity4 was just 17 when she posed for the photos , hoping they would land her a modeling job			1
" in her naivete , an agent convinced her to pose for this photo to submit to a lingerie company , claiming they could make her the next @entity114 's @entity113 model , " @entity135 told @entity137			0
" she has since learned what a lie that was , and what a mistake it was to have the photo taken			0
" @entity4 announced last week that she would star in a new $ 1.5 million ad campaign supporting what she termed " opposite marriage " ( marriage between a man and a woman ) funded by the @entity160			2
" marriage is good , " @entity4 said at a news conference announcing the ad campaign			1
" there is something special about unions of husband and wife			0
unless we bring men and women together , children will not have mothers and fathers			0
" @entity2 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
