it 's been a cruel irony for ancient mariners and any thirsty person who has ever gazed upon a sparkling blue ocean : water , water everywhere , and not a drop to drink			1
but imagine a coastal city of the future , say in 2035			0
along with basic infrastructure such as a port , roads , sewer lines and an electrical grid , it 's increasingly likely this city by the sea will contain a newer feature			0
thanks to improved technology , turning ocean water into freshwater is becoming more economically feasible			1
and a looming global water crisis may make it crucial to the planet 's future			2
the @entity28 predicts that by 2025 , two - thirds of the world 's population will suffer water shortages , especially in the developing world and the parched @entity34			2
scientists say climate change is making the problem worse			0
even in the @entity43 , demand for water in drought - ravaged @entity40 and the desert @entity41 is outpacing supply			1
this is why a huge desalination plant is under construction in @entity48 , @entity40 , some 30 miles north of @entity49			1
when completed in 2016 , it will be the largest such facility in the @entity51 and create 50 million gallons of freshwater a day			1
" whenever a drought exacerbates freshwater supplies in @entity40 , people tend to look toward the ocean for an answer , " said @entity53 , executive director of the @entity40 - based @entity54			1
" it is , after all , a seemingly inexhaustible supply			1
" a growing trend most desalination technology follows one of two methods : distillation through thermal energy or the use of membranes to filter salt from water			2
in the distillation process , saltwater is heated to produce water vapor , which is then condensed and collected as freshwater			2
the other method employs reverse osmosis to pump seawater through semi-permeable membranes -- paper - like filters with microscopic holes -- that trap the salt while allowing freshwater molecules to pass through			0
the remaining salty water is then pumped back into the ocean			2
officials at the @entity48 plant say they can covert two gallons of seawater into one gallon of freshwater by filtering out 99.9 % of the salt			1
there are some 16,000 desalination plants on the planet , and their numbers are rising			1
the amount of desalted water produced around the world has more than tripled since 2000 , according to the @entity98 at the @entity99 at @entity100			0
" desalination is growing in arid regions , " said @entity101 , director of the center			0
" we are making progress in the @entity43 , but the countries around the @entity108 are way ahead in the use of desalination , primarily because they have no alternative supplies of freshwater			0
" @entity116 , in an arid region with a coastline on the @entity115 , meets half its freshwater needs through desalination			0
@entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and the @entity123 also rely heavily on the ocean for their municipal water			2
in the @entity43 , desalination projects are concentrated in coastal states such as @entity40 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
some environmentalists are wary of desalination , which consumes large amounts of energy , produces greenhouse gases and kills vital marine organisms that are sucked into intake pipes			0
but proponents believe the technology offers a long - term , sustainable solution to the globe 's water shortages			0
one entrepreneur has even built an experimental solar desalination plant in @entity40 's @entity145			1
" when other freshwater sources are depleted , desalination will be our best choice , " said @entity101 , a @entity146 professor of engineering			0
@entity40 dreaming within the @entity43 , the water crisis is especially severe in @entity40 , which has been stricken by drought over the last three years			1
@entity40 's biggest source of freshwater is the snow that falls in the @entity156 and other mountains , where it slowly melts into creeks and makes its way into aquifers and reservoirs			2
but if the planet continues to grow warmer , snow will increasingly fall as rain and will be harder to collect because it will swell creeks faster and create more flooding , said @entity168 of the @entity54			0
seventeen desalination plants are being built or planned along the state 's 840 - mile coastline			1
city officials in @entity173 recently voted to reactivate their desalination plant , which was built in 1991 but shut after heavy rains filled nearby reservoirs in the early 1990s			1
another $ 200 million facility has been proposed for the @entity178 , although construction wo n't likely begin for several years			2
" the key question with ocean desalination is how much are you willing to pay for it ? the amount of energy required to desalt ocean water can be daunting , " said @entity168 , adding that operating costs at the @entity173 plant alone are estimated at $ 5 million per year			1
but advocates believe the price of desalination will continue to decrease as the process improves			0
this will be true of the massive @entity48 plant , said @entity195 , water resources manager with the @entity197			1
" the cost for this water will be about double what it costs us to import water into @entity49 , " @entity195 said			0
" however , over time we expect that the cost of desalinated water will equal , and be less than , the cost of imported water			0
that may take 15 or 20 years , but we expect that to occur			0
" ultimately , experts say , municipalities will need to balance desalination projects with conservation and water from more traditional sources , such as rivers , reservoirs and recycled wastewater			2
" you ca n't get all your water from one source and have that source be hundreds of miles away , " said @entity218 , senior vice president at @entity219 , which is leading development of the @entity48 plant			1
" when and if the drought does come , and you do n't have enough snowpack in the @entity156 -- after 12 dry years the @entity229 are seeing the impact of that today -- you 've got ( water ) sources here within the boundaries of @entity197 , " he said			0
" we have a $ 190 billion economy in this region			0
it 's dependent on water to sustain that economy			0
so the question you need to consider , is ' what 's the cost of not having enough water ? ' " drought - ravaged @entity40 turns to tech for help			1

there are 16,000 desalination plants on the planet , and their numbers are rising
a huge desalination plant is under construction in @entity48 , @entity40
when completed it will be the largest such facility in the @entity51
