-- @entity1 is an example of true grit success			1
she rose from the faceless assembly line of a @entity6 factory to a property magnate richer than @entity8 and @entity9			1
her company , @entity10 , literally changed the landscape of @entity6 and @entity12 over the past two decades			1
@entity13 has listed her family 's net worth at $ 3.6 billion			1
and she 's not stopping there			2
in a private transaction ( not related to her company business ) , her family and the @entity19 banking family of @entity20 just bought a 40 % stake in the iconic @entity25 building in @entity26 -- the building that houses the flagship @entity28 on @entity30			1
@entity1 recently sat down with @entity0 's @entity31 to talk about everything from her @entity6 childhood to the volatile property market and how her 14 - year old son tried to get a job at @entity37			1
failure is part of the puzzle @entity0 : did you come across a lot of bumps in the road and a lot of failures ? @entity1 : every day			1
i mean , i think that 's just life			2
you will always bump into difficulties , challenges and problems			0
it appears to be that we seem to be doing quite well , but as it is now , we 're still having challenges every day			0
so i think that 's just nothing unique			2
pivot and dribble around politics @entity0 : you moved from residential real estate to commercial and now you 're focusing on commercial			1
why did you do that , especially when we see new home prices still rising ? @entity70 : residential development has become very political			0
government policies ... are against any prices going up because this is a very social issue			0
the government comes out with policies that deal one day with this side [ of the issue ] another day with this side [ of the issue ]			0
we said , " let 's get out of this area			2
yeah , let 's move on to somewhere we can really exercise our skills as a developer			1
" i think the policies are so distorted			0
like someone who 's sick , you 've taken so much medicine that you 've lost the sense of which one works and which one does n't			2
that 's a little bit like the real estate market in @entity97			1
grab the opportunities @entity0 : on the @entity13 ' recent list of 24 self - made female billionaires , there are five women from @entity97 , one from @entity103			1
what is it about @entity97 and the women of your generation that allows them to achieve that highest level ? @entity70 : women of our generation went through the @entity113 , went through hardship , went through coming from nowhere			1
suddenly , we see @entity97 's been given so many amazing opportunities			1
so women just seized the opportunity			0
i think in terms of coming from a low base , coming from nowhere , we 're all equal			0
in @entity97 , there are a lot of problems but also there are a lot of opportunities			2
precisely because there are so many problems , things are not established ; therefore , there are opportunities			0
have a life outside of work @entity0 : you 're a mother of two boys			0
how do you do the work - life balance ? @entity70 : i 'm very , very focused on my children			2
in fact , i 'm very religious about having breakfast with them every morning , having dinner with them every evening , and spend all the weekends with them that i do n't work			0
so as long as i 'm not traveling , i 'm always with them and i go to their soccer and tennis matches			0
after dinner we 'd just sit together and do homework with my children because they need help			0
it also makes me realize the world is so much wider than just your business world .			0

she rose from assembly line of a @entity6 factory to property magnate
