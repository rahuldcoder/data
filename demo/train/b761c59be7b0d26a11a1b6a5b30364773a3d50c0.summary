-- kids having sex on prime time broadcast tv ? must be sweeps month			1
it 's so predictable , it 's almost laughable			0
that is , it would be if it were n't for the fact that there are real - world consequences for these brazen , ratings - boosting publicity ploys			0
@entity15 's soapy , teen - targeted " @entity18 " tried to boost sagging ratings this week by showing not one , but two teen couples having sex for the first time -- one gay , the other straight			1
show co-creator @entity24 and the folks over at " @entity18 " are spinning this as a " teachable moment " for teens and their parents , an opportunity for dialogue about safe sex and responsible choices			1
the problem is @entity24 wants to have his cake and eat it , too			0
@entity36 loves to defend teen sex story lines by insisting , " kids are having sex ! we 're reflecting the real world ! " but the truth is much more sobering and complicated			1
yes , there are and always have been sexually active teens , but never before have depictions of premarital teen sex been so widespread in the media			1
today , you are more likely to see sexualized teens than adults in sexual situations			0
by presenting teen sex as common , the media marginalizes teens who choose to remain abstinent while increasing the pressure teens are already feeling to become sexually active			1
television is a " sexual super peer , " according to @entity57 , a professor of journalism and mass communication at the @entity60			0
the phrase " peer pressure " is used to describe the influence a peer group can exert on a teen 's decisions			1
television amplifies that peer pressure by making the entire realm of television , and all the characters in it , part of the teen 's peer group			2
when television portrays attractive , popular teenage characters as sexually active , it sends a powerful message to young viewers that there is an expectation that they , too , should be sexually active and , in fact , there might be something wrong with them , if they are n't			1
teens are also aware that television influences their behavior			0
according to one survey , a third of youths age 12 and older say the media encourages them to have sex by making it seem like " everybody does it			2
" and why should n't they get that impression ? beyond making teen sex the norm , researchers have found heavy television viewing to be predictive of positive attitudes toward " recreational " or casual sex and negative attitudes toward remaining a virgin			1
studies have also found the more a teenager identifies with the characters they see on prime time tv shows , the more likely they are to be sexually experienced and to expect higher levels of sexual activity among their peers			2
at least half a dozen studies in the past few years have documented a strong correlation between exposure to adult media content as children and the early onset of sexual activity among teens			0
one study even found that viewing of sexual media content was predictive of teen pregnancy			2
if that is n't enough , why exactly do parents and teens need to sit down and watch a tv show that glamorizes teen sex in order to have a conversation about it ? let 's hope most parents pass on @entity36 's attempt to help them out with the visuals and simply have an honest conversation with their teenagers			1
if history is a predictor of future behavior , we can expect this trend to continue			0
a season or two into @entity24 's show " @entity153 " on the fx network , he was interviewed for a @entity156 network documentary about breaking sexual taboos on television			0
@entity24 stated , " it 's tough to get that sexual point of view across on television			0
hopefully i have made it possible for somebody on broadcast television to do a rear - entry scene in three years			0
maybe that will be my legacy			0
" this , ladies and gentlemen , is the self - styled sex - ed teacher to @entity173 's teens			2
the worst thing parents can do is step aside and let @entity36 do the teaching			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2
