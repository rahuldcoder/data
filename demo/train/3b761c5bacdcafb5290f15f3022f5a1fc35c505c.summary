-- the @entity2 climate change conference this year was the most significant in nearly 20 years of gatherings under the @entity5 process aimed at staving off future global warming disaster			1
since carbon dioxide emission limits agreed to under the @entity9 were to expire at the stroke of midnight on december 31 , 2012 , it was critical that the international community agreed to extend those obligations and to continue talks about future emission cuts			2
but the outcome fell far short of what will be necessary to keep the world 's average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees @entity19 in the foreseeable future			2
under the @entity2 arrangement , 17 of the 25 biggest carbon emitting countries ( including @entity22 , the @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 ) did not commit to any legally binding emission limits			1
the countries that did agree to extend and deepen their @entity30 emission reductions , including the @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , make up only about 15 % of the world 's emissions			2
that seems like a rather meager return on the investment of time and effort over the past years			2
but there is one silver lining			0
the world 's top 20 carbon emitters together make up about 77 % of emission and account for about 4.3 billion people , which is about 62 % of the global population			1
the remaining 170 or so countries account for just over 20 % of emissions			0
as often is the case , these negotiations over climate have come to symbolize epic @entity54 struggles pitting poor developing countries against recalcitrant government officials from rich countries			0
lobbying efforts , shaming tactics , and staging public demonstrations have been the slingshots of choice			0
one result is that more people are paying attention to environmental issues			0
nonetheless , it is time to abandon the myth that a consensus solution is necessarily the best approach			1
the unfortunate reality is that little can get done right now			0
it 's like having hundreds of cooks with hundreds of different recipes attempting to prepare one meal in the same small kitchen			0
after two decades of hard work , it is time to consider reducing the number of cooks			1
a better alternative to a @entity83 - style conference would be for the 25 major emitters to come to an agreement just among themselves about their mutual commitments to deal with climate change effectively			1
in other words , get the 25 cooks to work together on the main meal			2
the hundreds of other cooks ought to step out of the kitchen			0
some smaller , focused discussions have already started , such as in the @entity95			1
imagine what kind of deals on cutting emissions would be possible just among @entity22 , @entity25 and the @entity23 -- the top three emitters in the world respectively			0
imagine a deal involving emission sources in @entity22 , which has some of the world 's most polluting coal - fired power plants , and @entity105 , which is on a course to become one of the most stringently controlled states in carbon emissions			1
of course , there are no guarantees for success			0
but discussions within such a smaller group would allow government leaders to confront the realities of climate change and engage in direct horse - trading without the static of thousands of other voices desiring to load their issues into the deal			1
let 's face it -- we are way beyond the time for finding an ideal solution			1
every year the world waits to take further concrete steps to cut emissions , the atmosphere will be loaded with millions of tons more carbon dioxide that will stay for a century			0
and the job of limiting global warming to 2 degrees celsius will be more out of reach			0
at the best , gatherings like the one in @entity2 dangle a tantalizing mirage of achieving a sustainable future			1
at the worst , they give cover to governments that would rather avoid the hard choices they ultimately will have to make			0
after one more expensive and time - consuming round of talks , it 's time to be honest with what can really be accomplished in these @entity83 - style gatherings			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			2

@entity153 : result of @entity2 climate change conference less than desirable
@entity151 : it 's time to abandon the myth that a consensus solution is the best approach
he says the 25 major carbon emitters should work out an agreement among themselves
@entity151 : smaller , focused discussions may be better than large , @entity83 - style gatherings
