@entity0 , @entity1 -- the " dream 9 , " five women and four men , say that they are " undocumented and unafraid			2
" do n't believe it			2
i bet they were afraid			2
who would n't have been ? the nine -- @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 -- spent more than two weeks in a federal immigration detention facility in @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity16 and @entity14 -- had been put in solitary confinement for what was supposed to be 15 days			2
all because they would n't take " go " for an answer			2
some of these " dreamers " had been deported to @entity28 by the @entity30 administration , though president @entity30 has repeatedly said that his administration is not looking to deport @entity32 -- the name taken by young immigrants who are in the @entity35 without papers			1
three of them who were on this side of the border -- @entity18 , @entity16 and @entity42 -- " self deported " to @entity28 to join the other six			0
then , on july 22 , all nine linked arms and marched across the border into the @entity35			1
the idea was to draw attention to the administration 's repressive immigration policies			1
the nine asked for humanitarian parole			1
when that was denied , they claimed asylum			2
opinion : let 's deport rep. @entity55 now , they have been set free			0
earlier in the week , federal officials found that all nine have " credible fear " of persecution or torture in their birth countries and thus can not be removed without a hearing before an immigration judge			1
pending those hearings , the nine have now been released into the waiting arms of family members within the @entity35			1
it 's a major victory for the @entity32 movement			0
for many , this is a heartwarming story about the power of the individual who is brave enough to make a stand			0
for others , it is major inconvenience			0
it 's a story that the @entity80 wishes would go away			0
ditto for immigration reformers who are split between those who back the dream 9 and those who want to sacrifice them for political expediency			2
@entity88 , former president of the @entity89 , callously dismissed the dream 9 action as a " publicity stunt " and a distraction			0
he also said it was unlikely that the three dreamers who voluntarily left the @entity35 would qualify for asylum			1
so far , @entity88 has been spectacularly wrong			0
all nine will get asylum hearings			2
and the @entity32 got more warmth from @entity98			1
thirty - five lawmakers signed a letter asking @entity30 to use his discretion to release the young people from custody			2
the letter -- signed by @entity105			0
@entity106 , @entity1 , @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109 , @entity110 , among others -- describes the activists as " victims of our broken immigration policy " who " deserve to come home to the @entity35			1
" immigration reformers were bound to lose confidence in this administration			2
a president ca n't deport nearly 2 million people in under five years , split up hundreds of thousands of families , detain thousands of undocumented children without giving them access to legal counsel , and expand @entity108 - style immigration enforcement nationwide through the maniacal program known as " @entity128 " without raising a stink			1
for many , what happened to the @entity84 was the last straw			0
searching for the @entity132 in @entity28 @entity133 and @entity14 were in solitary confinement because , according to authorities , they started a ruckus in the dining hall			0
did n't @entity30 say that the @entity32 were @entity35 except for legal status ? this is how @entity35 behave			1
we 're ornery , courageous and defiant			0
we yell " freedom " at the top of our lungs			0
these kids are @entity35 , all right			1
the next thing you know , a bunch of @entity32 will dump tea into @entity151			0
besides , @entity30 made quite a show -- before the election -- of announcing that his administration was sparing @entity32 deportation by offering deferred action and temporary work permits			0
nearly 300,000 @entity32 have been awarded the special accommodation so far			0
there 's not room for nine more ? some might not be eligible for deferred action , some might be			0
maybe there would be more compassion on the @entity166 if these young people had n't embarrassed @entity30 , put the lie to the fairy tale that this administration has been compassionate toward immigrants , divided self - serving organizations such as the lawyers group @entity89 , and pitted one group of immigration reformers against another -- those who want to protect the @entity32 versus those who want to protect the president			1
i 've had my differences with the @entity32 movement			0
i think that many of these young people have a sense of entitlement , like most young people in the @entity35			1
i did n't think it was a good idea for @entity32 activists to disrupt congressional hearings on immigration reform , or occupy the offices of reform advocates like rep. @entity192 , @entity193			1
and i think much of what drives @entity32 activists within the @entity35 is a look - at - me narcissism fed by social media and a culture where young people are told they can become the next @entity199			1
opinion : @entity80 , knowledge economy needs immigrants but i never questioned their sincerity , or dismissed anything they did as a stunt			0
i would n't presume to tell people who put their freedom at risk along the @entity35 - @entity28 border that the difficult decisions they 're making are the wrong ones			1
and i certainly would n't do it to protect an administration that does n't deserve protecting			0
the dream 9 are back where they belong -- in the @entity35			1
but this story is n't over			0
the fault lines it exposed within the immigration reform movement remain			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			1

@entity223 : nine dreamer activists were in federal immigration detention in @entity108
they *'d* tried to *re-enter* the @entity35 asking for humanitarian parole or asylum and were *jailed*
he says they have been freed , granted immigration hearing , drew support from @entity98
@entity223 : dreamers sometimes have look - at - me activism , but this request is *valid*
