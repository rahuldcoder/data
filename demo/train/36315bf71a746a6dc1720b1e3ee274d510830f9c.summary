@entity1 president @entity0 on thursday defended his government 's record on free speech and rejected a claim it uses " @entity8 " methods , a day after two international rights groups issued scathing reports			1
@entity0 was put on the spot during an annual televised call - in session in @entity13			1
it was his first since he was elected to a third term as president last may and lasted close to five hours			0
journalist @entity17 , who is editor in chief of the @entity13 radio station , asked @entity0 if @entity1 can use " stalinist tools " if it wants to be an advanced , modern state			1
" i do n't think we can see @entity8 elements here , " @entity0 responded			2
@entity24 is recalled for " the personality cult and mass violation of law , reprisals , prison camps -- we see nothing like that in @entity1 today and i hope we will never see that again			2
our people will never allow that to happen again , " he said			0
" but that does n't mean we should have no discipline , no law and order -- and all people in @entity1 should be equal before the law			2
" that includes the women in the punk band @entity42 , @entity0 said			2
" no one puts anyone in prison for political reasons , for their political views			1
they get punished for violating the law			0
everybody should observe the law			0
" three @entity42 members were convicted last year of hooliganism for performing a song critical of @entity0 in a @entity56 cathedral , in a brief but provocative protest action			0
two are still in prison following the controversial trial			0
the reports published wednesday by @entity61 and @entity62 both outlined a deterioration in the freedom of speech , citing a heavy clampdown on critics and activists @entity62 said the government has " unleashed a crackdown on civil society unprecedented in the country 's @entity71 history " in the 12 months since @entity0 regained the presidency			0
" the authorities have introduced a series of restrictive laws , harassed , intimidated , and in several cases imprisoned political activists , interfered in the work of nongovernmental organizations ( @entity82 ) and sought to cast government critics as clandestine enemies , thereby threatening the viability of @entity1 's civil society , " it said			1
@entity0 told the audience it is ok to have demonstrations , " but they should be legal " and should n't interfere with other people 's lives			0
controls of the @entity94 are needed only to limit access to child pornography , pedophilia and education on " suicide activities , " @entity0 said			2
@entity0 said non-governmental organizations are welcome in @entity1 -- and play a useful role in exposing local abuses of power -- but those that receive foreign funding and are involved in political affairs should declare where the money came from and what it is spent on			1
the two rights groups were critical of new laws which , @entity62 said , " clearly seek to limit , or even end , independent advocacy and other @entity82 work			0
" the president also was asked about the trial for embezzlement of prominent @entity119 critic and opposition leader @entity117 , which resumed wednesday in the northern city of @entity122			0
@entity117 , who 's also a popular anti-corruption blogger , says the charges are politically motivated			0
@entity0 responded that " people who fight corruption have to be completely honest themselves ... if someone accuses other people of stealing , it does n't mean he 's above the law himself			0
" international relations @entity0 urged closer cooperation between different countries ' security services in the wake of the @entity136 bombings			1
on two occasions -- in march and late september 2011 -- @entity1 authorities asked @entity140 authorities to investigate one of the bombing suspects , @entity141			1
@entity144 agents on wednesday interviewed his parents in @entity146 , in @entity1 's @entity147			0
" this tragedy should motivate us to work closer together , " @entity0 said			1
" if we combine our efforts we will not suffer blows like that			0
" questioned about his country 's external ties , @entity0 acknowledged that there has been " some cooling off " in @entity1 's relationship with the @entity140 since the @entity157 , which @entity13 opposed			1
@entity0 also pointed to other @entity140 actions as factors in the deterioration of relations between @entity13 and @entity162			1
he highlighted the decision of @entity140 lawmakers to pass the december 2012 @entity165 , a law that imposes visa bans on and freezes the assets of 18 @entity1 officials believed to be connected to the death in prison of whistle - blowing @entity1 lawyer @entity171			1
" why did they do this ? nobody knows the answer to that question , " @entity0 said			0
@entity1 's lawmakers responded to the @entity171 list with their own list , slapping similar sanctions on 18 @entity140 it called rights violators			2
@entity0 also said he is grateful for the @entity185 administration 's support of @entity1 's entry to the @entity187 but questioned why it still has @entity190 - era legislation -- the so - called @entity189 -- governing its trade relations with @entity1			1
the @entity140 has waived the legislation every year since 1994 , but it still violates @entity187 rules requiring members of the body to give one another permanent normal trade relations			2
@entity197 's engagement in the @entity199 conflict also led to cooler relations , @entity0 said			2
the session was @entity0 's 11th televised question - and - answer conference , according to @entity1 state - run broadcaster @entity203			1

@entity0 says the @entity208 tragedy should motivate countries to work together
