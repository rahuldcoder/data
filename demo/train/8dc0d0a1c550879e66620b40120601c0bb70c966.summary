-- a month after announcing plans to expand offshore drilling , president @entity1 visited ground zero of the @entity6 oil disaster and warned that residents could be facing a " potentially unprecedented environmental disaster			1
" " the oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our @entity6 states and it could extend for a long time			2
it could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of @entity19 who call this place home , " @entity1 said sunday in @entity15 , @entity16			0
the president reiterated that oil company @entity23 is responsible for the leak and will foot the cost of the cleanup			0
he pledged to " spare no effort to respond to this crisis for as long as it continues			0
" @entity1 's remarks were a stark contrast from his late march proposal to open swaths of @entity19 coastal waters in the @entity35 and the @entity6 to oil and natural gas drilling			1
@entity1 said then that the decision did not come lightly , but it was one that he approached with confidence			0
" the bottom line is this : given our energy needs , in order to sustain economic growth and produce jobs , and keep our businesses competitive , we are going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable , homegrown energy , " he said as he unveiled his plans			0
@entity1 said the federal government would begin the process of leasing some areas off the coasts of @entity59 , @entity60 and possibly @entity61 to oil companies for drilling			1
new offshore drilling in most @entity19 waters has been banned since the early 1980s , when mounting public pressure pushed lawmakers into action			2
a disastrous oil spill off the @entity71 coast in 1969 sparked protests that grew into a broader environmental movement , which eventually forced a drilling moratorium			1
but as the environmental impact of the @entity6 spill comes ashore , the appetite for @entity1 's offshore drilling plan and the enthusiasm from administration officials appear to have subsided			1
@entity81 : oil spill may threaten offshore drilling plans " all he has said is that he 's not going to continue the moratorium on drilling , " @entity85 senior adviser @entity84 told @entity90 's " @entity89 " on friday			1
" no domestic drilling in new areas is going to go forward until there is an adequate review of what 's happened here and of what is being proposed elsewhere			0
" secretary of state @entity98 said sunday that moving ahead on offshore drilling is " going to require a balancing act			2
" " that is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our dependence on foreign oil			0
but it has to be done safely			0
it ca n't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars cleaning up these spills , " she said on @entity108 's " @entity107			0
" and interior secretary @entity111 said sunday that the @entity6 disaster " sends out the clarion call that we need to diversify our energy resources			0
" " our intention is to move forward thoughtfully , looking at how we can protect the resources of the @entity19 and making thoughtful decisions , " he said on @entity0 's " @entity116 , " noting that deep - water drilling has been done thousands of times without incident			0
time.com : @entity1 promises help , but containing spill is still talk @entity1 said friday he still believes that domestic oil production is an important part of the strategy for energy security , but he added , " i 've always said it must be done responsibly , for the safety of our workers and our environment			2
" the president ordered @entity111 to conduct a review of the oil spill and report back in 30 days on what precautions , if any , should be required to prevent future accidents			2
@entity142 sen. @entity141 of @entity61 has asked @entity1 to shelve his proposal , at least until the cause of the current spill is fully investigated			1
in a letter to the president , @entity141 also said he would file legislation " that would , for the time being , prohibit the @entity149 from acting on your administration 's plans to expand offshore drilling , including seismic testing and other exploratory operations			1
" @entity61 gov. @entity156 , who in the past has been a proponent of offshore drilling , told @entity108 's " @entity107 " that such drilling has " got to be tabled , for sure			1
" @entity85 press secretary @entity160 indicated last week that @entity1 's offshore plans are n't set in stone			1
" i think our focus right now is , one , the area , the spill , and two , also to ultimately determine the cause of it and see the impact that that ultimately may or may not have , " he said , noting that @entity1 's announcement was the beginning , and not the end , of a longer process			1
@entity81 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
