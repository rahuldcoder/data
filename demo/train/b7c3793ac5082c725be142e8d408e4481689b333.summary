-- @entity2 's @entity1 has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country 's assistant interior minister last thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack			1
a @entity2 man reads a newspaper featuring a front - page story on thursday 's attack			1
the disclosures reported by the country 's official news agency were highly unusual			0
the agency , @entity17 , reported the attacker , @entity18 , a wanted @entity2 militant who had been hiding in @entity19 , got in touch with @entity2 authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to @entity2 prince @entity24 , the assistant minister of interior for security affairs			1
after arriving back in @entity2 , @entity18 spoke by phone to @entity24 , who agreed to see him during a @entity28 reception at his home in the city of @entity31			1
according to a transcript provided by @entity17 , during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of @entity28			0
@entity24 is quoted as telling @entity18 that " one should be careful ; evil people would like to exploit all of you			1
now only you to fear @entity40 and come home			0
" later in the conversation , @entity18 asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with @entity24			2
@entity18 , escorted by security , was transported to @entity31 , where he met with the prince at his palace			1
during the meeting , @entity18 explained to @entity24 that other @entity2 militants in @entity19 also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince			1
according to @entity17 , a call was then placed to one of the militants in @entity19			1
while the prince was on the phone , @entity18 blew himself up , @entity17 reported			2
@entity24 , who is also the son of the country 's interior minister , was lightly injured in the attack			2
@entity2 @entity59 was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on @entity63			2
the king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly			0
prince @entity24 answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake			0
@entity17 adds that " the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident			0
however , the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that , for security considerations , will not be announced at this time			0
" @entity18 's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by @entity2 in february			1
at the time the list was released , @entity2 asked @entity81 for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted @entity2 on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against @entity2 from abroad			1
the announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose			0
it is also unusual for @entity2 to ask for help in finding them			2
some of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from @entity97 , returned to @entity2 , and had then gone through a @entity99 reeducation program run by the @entity1 , before fleeing to @entity19 and taking up terrorist activity once more			1
@entity2 has been battling terrorism since 2003 , when @entity102 launched a series of attacks inside the @entity105			2
in the security crackdown that followed , @entity18 , like many other wanted @entity2 militants , fled to @entity19			1
earlier this year , @entity108 and @entity109 merged to form " @entity110			0
" @entity110 , which operates out of @entity19 , claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against @entity24			0
in august , @entity2 's @entity1 announced that over the past year , 44 @entity102 suspects across the country had been arrested			0
while the @entity1 is calling the attempted assassination an " action of treachery and treason " , @entity17 reports that the @entity119 will not change its " open - door policy " of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular , " those citizens residing outside the country " who wish to " take advantage of the state - sponsored program of advice and care			0
