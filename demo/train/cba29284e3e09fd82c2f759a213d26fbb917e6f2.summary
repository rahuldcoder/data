@entity0 -- " @entity2 of trust and confidence " is the motto of the almost 150 - year - old @entity6 , and director @entity7 now faces the dual task of proving it true and keeping his job			1
a scandal involving allegations of partying with prostitutes in @entity14 shortly before president @entity16 's arrival last week for the @entity17 has forced a rare spotlight on the internal workings of an agency labeled as secret			1
@entity7 , a @entity6 veteran for almost three decades who was sworn in as director on may 31 , 2006 , is the focus of demands by the @entity25 and @entity26 -- and a perplexed @entity28 public -- to figure out exactly what happened			1
at issue is how 11 agents ended up in a potentially compromising situation in violation of agency standards			2
more important are questions raised about whether it was a lone incident or indicative of a culture far removed from the legendary discipline and integrity exuded by the agency			1
so far , three @entity6 members are leaving over the scandal -- one forced out , one retiring and one resigning -- and more resignations are expected			1
while one member of @entity26 has called for @entity7 's ouster , other influential legislators and officials quickly defended his initial steps in dealing with the scandal			1
@entity25 spokesman @entity51 told reporters thursday that @entity16 has " faith in the director ( and ) confidence in his leadership , " adding : " we are not going to prejudge outcomes and discuss the future of this agency in a press briefing while this investigation is going on			0
" " the fact of the matter is this is an incident that requires investigation , " @entity51 said			0
" @entity67 has acted with speed in addressing the matter , investigating the matter , holding people accountable , and continuing to push forward with the investigation			0
" @entity74 chairman @entity73 , @entity75 , said he has been in close touch with @entity7 and believes the agency director is taking " serious action " to investigate the incident , while @entity80 chairman rep. @entity79 , @entity81 , said he has a high level of confidence in @entity7			1
steps taken so far include bringing home the agents involved , stripping them of their security clearance and questioning that has included at least one polygraph exam			0
in addition , sources said @entity7 wants to form an outside panel to examine if the @entity95 incident reflected a problem of wrongdoing embedded in agency culture			1
" he 's outraged by this , " @entity1 national security contributor @entity99 said of @entity7 after talking to him			1
rather than making @entity7 the target or fall guy , members of @entity26 want to give him the opportunity to investigate it and bring in outsiders to look at the agency culture , @entity99 said thursday			1
despite their initial praise , legislators made clear they need more answers			0
@entity79 and the ranking @entity115 on the oversight committee , rep. @entity112 of @entity113 , sent @entity7 a letter demanding comprehensive information on the incident			1
@entity112 told @entity1 of a conversation he had with @entity7 on wednesday -- before the departures of the initial three @entity6 agents were announced -- that explained the culture of pride permeating the @entity6			1
" i could tell that he was very upset , and probably more upset than a lot of the people on ( in @entity26 ) can be , " @entity112 said thursday			0
" ... i asked him a question			0
i said , ' look , i get the impression that there 's a culture of pride , of excellence , of being the best			2
' i said , " is it possible that these men might resign ? ' he said he had absolutely no doubt that they would			0
" @entity112 continued : " they have this pride they do n't want any bad apples and so it probably would be so uncomfortable to them that they would leave			0
so , yesterday 's actions with regard to folks leaving and being fired did not surprise me one bit			0
" to @entity26 and the nation , the @entity6 symbolizes the highest level of protective security			2
most visible are the agents who guard the president and vice president , familiar to the public by their sunglasses and earphones and through films such as " in @entity160 " starring @entity156 in 1993 and " @entity157 " a year later with @entity158 and @entity159			0
the @entity6 was created as a division of the @entity162 on july 5 , 1865 , to suppress counterfeit currency			2
it quickly expanded to take on the @entity164 , moonshiners and others " perpetrating fraud against the government , " according to the @entity6 website www.secretservice.gov			2
the agency assumed responsibility for protecting the president in 1902 , and its role continued to expand in ensuing decades			0
when the @entity174 was created after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the @entity6 moved over from @entity162			2
@entity7 has an exemplary record with the @entity6 , rising up through the ranks and receiving the @entity179 in 2005 and 2010 , the website said			1
born in @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity7 graduated from @entity182 in @entity183 and joined the @entity6 as a special agent in @entity185 in 1983			1
among his assignments were stints in the fraud division and the presidential protective division before becoming a supervisor			0
the @entity14 scandal is not the first public problem encountered under @entity7 's direction			1
in 2009 , a couple got into a @entity25 state dinner without invitations , embarrassing the @entity6			2
while the agency had ultimate responsibility for security that night , the problem was eventually attributed more to a @entity25 failure to check invitations			2
@entity7 's challenge now is to make sure that the agency 's reputation of excellence as an elite force continues , @entity112 said			1
" it 's just not what happened here , but it 's even the appearance that that organization could be pierced , " he said			0
" we do n't even want people to even be thinking that that 's possible			0
and so they 've got to re-establish trust , and they also have to make sure that any holes they may find , any weakness , will be filled			0
" @entity1 's @entity221 contributed to this report .			0
