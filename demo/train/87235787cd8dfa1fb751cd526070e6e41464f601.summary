-- in 2012 , @entity2 prime minister @entity1 defended the highly divisive renovation of @entity4 in central @entity5 by invoking history			1
referring to the plan to build a replica of a monumental 19th century @entity10 army barracks that once stood there , he said : " we are working to bring back history that has been destroyed			1
... we will unite @entity4 with its history			1
" as it turned out , @entity1 's attempt to unite @entity4 with its history has revealed very deep fissures in @entity2 culture			1
starting at the end of may , more and more opponents of the renovations began gathering in the square			0
protests evolved into a general condemnation of the government , becoming more chaotic , with police attacking protesters with water cannons and tear gas			0
thousands have been injured and at least two protesters and one police officer have died			0
the demonstrations have spread to other cities			0
although @entity1 has claimed to be open to " democratic demands , " he has denied the legitimacy of all the public unrest			0
a day after the prime minister proposed talks with protesters , bulldozers and riot police swept through the square and blanketed the area with tear gas			1
chaos and standoffs between police and protesters continue			0
@entity2 looks for ' legitamite protestors ' debating the causes of the conflict , some commentators focus on the role of @entity55 in @entity2 ; others emphasize disagreements about the nature of @entity2 democracy , the lack of civil liberties , or the nascent environmentalist movement , which was stirred by plans to take down trees in the square 's @entity65			1
all these played a role in igniting unrest , but the issues surrounding the reconstruction of the @entity71 in particular point to deep unresolved historical tensions within the @entity2			1
the protesters and the government are engaging not only in a battle for their park and perhaps their country 's future , but also for control over the past			0
when @entity83 founded the @entity2 in 1923 , after years of war , he was embraced by a population eager to return to the days of the great @entity86			1
but @entity83 chose , instead , to modernize , westernize , and secularize the country			1
he disbanded the @entity88 , secularized the education system , outlawed @entity55 , enforced gender equality , westernized the @entity2 alphabet , and famously banned the fez			2
but these radical and sometimes ruthless steps , especially those that ran counter to perceived @entity96 mores , engendered deep resentment and resistance			1
opinion : from victim to villain , @entity1 's unfinished transformation in the last decade , @entity1 and his @entity102 , known as @entity102 , have exploited that resistance as an element in their rise to power			1
under @entity102 rule , the @entity10 past has re-emerged in a culturally powerful way			1
the movie " @entity114 , " a highly dramatized account of the @entity10 conquest of @entity113 in 1453 , had the biggest budget in the history of @entity2 cinema , an investment handsomely rewarded by its box office returns			1
@entity2 television is full of @entity10 - era dramas and soap operas , including the wildly successful " @entity123 , " set in the era of the famous emperor @entity125			1
more and more aspects of elite @entity2 culture embrace @entity10 architecture , fashion and even food			1
but according to some opponents of the @entity102 , the cultural embrace of @entity10 history promotes a political agenda of regional domination			1
the decision to rebuild a symbol of @entity10 militarism , the @entity71 , like the decision to name the new @entity141 bridge after @entity142 , conqueror of the @entity144 world , feeds this speculation			2
in popular @entity2 culture , the @entity146 are associated with the killing of @entity150 army officers in 1909 , while the @entity151 -- a large minority group in @entity2 -- remember @entity142 as the murderer of their people			2
thus , both bridge and barracks pit one view of history against another			0
but the @entity10 were not merely expansionary conquerors , nor were they generally devoted to @entity96 purity			1
at their best , the @entity162 ruled over a surprisingly pluralistic society that enabled people of diverse religions and ethnicities to flourish and live in relative autonomy			0
both non-turkish @entity168 and @entity169 rose to great heights of political power			0
jews fled from @entity150 persecutions into @entity10 territory			2
in the wake of the riots , elements of this @entity10 legacy have begun to emerge as well			2
@entity179 , who played @entity180 in " @entity114 , " declined to join @entity5 's formal celebration of the 560th anniversary of the conquest of @entity113			0
instead , joining actors from " @entity123 , " he went to @entity65 to support the protests			0
thus , the protesters were treated to actors playing @entity180 and @entity125 marching and tweeting alongside them			0
@entity179 , like @entity1 , invoked @entity10 history			2
he said , just before the violence began , that @entity180 preserved the @entity192 basilica @entity190 when he took the city			0
" such were our ancestors , " he said			0
" they preserved things , did not destroy or tear down			0
" as with any turbulent situation , it 's hard to predict what will happen in @entity65 or within the broader cycles of social unrest emerging in @entity2			2
@entity1 looks unlikely to back down , at least not without a huge loss of face			0
because the @entity102 has enjoyed broad popular support for its agenda , it will require internal pressure from within the movement to push @entity1 toward a consensus settlement			2
but even if issues involving @entity4 are eventually resolved without greater riots and brutality , the question of the meaning and relevance of the @entity10 past remains powerful			1
in " @entity114 , " @entity180 proclaims , " making history is no job for cowards			0
" the events unfolding in @entity4 remind us that remembering history can be just as dangerous as making it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			0

@entity227 : plan to reconstruct @entity10 era barracks in @entity4 revealed deep divisions
when @entity83 modernized @entity2 , he says , many resented parting with old @entity96 ways
@entity227 : prime minister and his @entity102 party exploited that resentment in their rise to power
the meaning and relevance of the @entity10 past remains a powerful question , he says
