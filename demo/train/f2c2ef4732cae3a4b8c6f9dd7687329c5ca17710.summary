-- @entity1 became the youngest player to win a @entity4 event sunday as the 23 - year - old @entity5 held on for a one - shot victory in the @entity7 in @entity8			1
dressed in the trademark red of the previous record holder @entity11 , @entity1 carded a level par 72 at @entity13 to total four - under 284			1
@entity15 @entity14 and @entity16 tied for second , while @entity11 re-aggravated his back injury as he limped home with a six - over 78 to leave him tied for 25th			1
the world number one had started the day only three back of @entity1 after a brilliant third round 66 , but did not make a birdie for only the eighth time in his career			2
with the first major of the season looming at @entity29 , @entity11 will be hoping to make a quick recovery and be able to play in the @entity31 in two weeks time			2
@entity1 is the latest young gun to challenge the established order and it was his third victory on the @entity35 in the last 14 starts although by far the biggest with a winning check of $ 1,530,000			1
he was not short on confidence either in his victory television interview : " i have three wins on the @entity35 , " he said			0
" you do n't see a lot of guys that have done that			0
i feel i 'm one of the top five players in the world			0
" a bold statement , but @entity1 's wire to wire victory was certainly impressive and he opened up a four - shot lead around the turn on the @entity53			0
but as @entity14 and former masters winner @entity16 began to make up ground , @entity1 started to struggle , bogeying the 15th to give his rivals hope			1
a brilliant par save on 17th gave him breathing space , with @entity14 bogeying the last to go back into a tie in the clubhouse with @entity16 on three under			2
@entity1 could afford to bogey the last as he completed another memorable victory on only his second year on the @entity35			1
other big names as well as @entity11 also struggled and former number one @entity62 , who challenged at halfway , finished with a 74 to leave himself on the five over mark			0
" on the greens i did n't get anything going with the putter and anytime i missed the green i did n't really get anything going , " @entity62 moaned			0
world number two @entity71 also finished tied 25th at five over , having gone into the $ 9 million event with hopes of leap frogging @entity11 .			0
