@entity0 -- do n't look for president @entity2 to get much political kudos for @entity5 's humming job creation engine			1
the jobless rate is steady at 5.8 percent , the stock market 's roaring , the housing market is stirring and the rescued auto industry is motoring			0
gas is down to $ 2.71 a gallon , according to an @entity15 average , leaving a little extra cash for families this @entity18			0
new @entity19 figures out friday show unemployment at a six - year low , and the economy shattered expectations by pumping out more than 320,000 jobs last month in the biggest hiring splurge in three years			1
related : 2014 is best year for jobs numbers since 1999 @entity2 had to suffer through months of grim jobs numbers in his first term , but had a spring in his step after friday 's @entity19 report			1
no wonder he turned the @entity32 event at which he announced his new nominee to head the @entity34 into an opportunity to crow about jobs			2
" so far this year , over the first 11 months of 2014 , our economy has created 2.65 million jobs , " he said			1
" that 's more than in any entire year since the @entity42 businesses have now created 10.9 million jobs over the past 57 months in a @entity44 and that 's the longest streak of private sector job growth on record			2
" or as @entity48 , president of progressive group @entity49 for @entity50 put it on @entity52 : " 321k jobs			2
50 straight months of job creation			0
" but do n't waste too much time looking for credit for the president			2
he has a political problem , however well the economy does			2
most @entity5 by now have decided whether they like him or not			1
so even if the economy roars , his approval ratings are unlikely to soar			0
despite steering out of the worst slump since the 1930s , which was destroying 700,000 jobs a month , @entity2 still gets a thumbs down from @entity5 on the economy , to the frustration of many inside the @entity70			1
his approval numbers are stuck in the mid-to - low 40s and a @entity72 last month found 53 % of @entity5 disapprove of how he 's handling the economy			1
many people just do n't feel their lives are getting better			1
seventy - eight percent of voters in november 's mid-term elections were worried about the direction of the economy in the next year , according to exit polls			1
only 32 percent said it was getting better			0
" has there been more employment since the economic crisis ? the answer is yes , " said @entity85 of @entity86			0
" what we have got to talk about is the quality of the employment			0
" while the economy is pumping out hundreds of thousands of jobs a month , it 's barely keeping up with population growth			1
many new jobs are coming in the service sector , in restaurants and bars for instance , where work is often part - time , low paid and lacks benefits that give people economic security			0
@entity104 , of the @entity105 at @entity106 , said growth in traditional blue collar jobs that once anchored the middle class , in industries like the building trade , is bouncing back too slowly			0
" we would have expected at this stage of the recovery , construction payrolls rebounding a lot better than they have , " said @entity104			0
there 's also excess supply in the production sector which includes food manufacture and work with raw materials like coal and wood			0
that goes a long way to explaining why middle class voters in @entity129 , industrial and @entity131 states lashed out at @entity132 in november			0
those voters may also shape the 2016 presidential race as mid-term exit polls showed that the economy was easily the most important issue , despite a campaign overtaken by @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			1
@entity143 data also shows many @entity5 still struggling in the shadows			1
the @entity145 , measuring those who have a job or are looking for one , was stuck near 36 - year lows in november			0
" middle - class families across the country , including my home state of @entity158 , are struggling to get by on wages that have n't kept pace with rising costs , " said @entity150 house speaker @entity150 on friday , blaming @entity2 for suffocating a quicker recovery by burdening the economy with " massive " regulations and rising health care premiums			1
@entity132 complain the @entity161 has blocked every job creation plan @entity2 has offered for years			2
long term trends like the loss of manufacturing jobs overseas and new technology that wipes out manual jobs will also shape how people feel about the economy for years to come			1
but , there is some hope			0
consumer sentiment , as measured by the @entity172 index , was at its highest level since the recession in november			0
@entity132 voters are meanwhile more upbeat on the economy than @entity161 , according to the @entity179 survey			0
that suggests people decide on how the economy is doing depending on who lives in the @entity32			2
but @entity2 can console himself with one thought : history is more likely to look more kindly on his economic recovery than those who lived through it .			1

economy shatters expectations , pumps out *321,000* jobs in november
but many @entity5 do n't feel their lives are improving
history will *remember* @entity2 for exit from @entity197
