@entity0 -- fbi director @entity2 said thursday he is concerned about the potential for terrorists mounting cyber attacks and that the bureau is working " to stay ahead of these threats , both at home and abroad			1
" " while to date terrorists have not used the @entity17 to launch a full - scale cyber attack , we can not underestimate their intent , " @entity2 testified to a @entity10 subcommittee in which lawmakers pressed him about what additional funding and laws may be necessary to combat the cyber threat			1
@entity2 did not provide many details during the public session , but later met with senators behind closed doors to provide additional information			1
@entity2 noted that terror groups are becoming more " cyber savvy			1
" as examples , he cited @entity28 , which publishes an online magazine called @entity31 , and the @entity33 group @entity32 , which has its own @entity35 account			0
more importantly , however , he said , terrorists are " using cyberspace to conduct operations			0
" @entity39 sen. @entity39 of @entity40 asked @entity2 whether a cyber attack suspect tied to @entity28 would be treated differently than a regular criminal suspect			2
many members of @entity44 have said terror suspects are better handled by the military than going through a criminal court process			0
but @entity2 did not debate the issue , saying when a cyber intrusion happens , his agency 's goal is to find out who is behind the computer			2
" at the point in time of an intrusion , you do n't know whether it 's going to be a country , a terrorist or the 18 - year - old kid down the block , " he said .			0
