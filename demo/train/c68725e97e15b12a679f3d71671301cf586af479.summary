the collective freak out you heard at 6:58 a.m. et tuesday morning was the cadre of @entity4 followers reacting to an email from " @entity6 " with the subject line " announcement			1
" after a few short heart palpitations ( and reading the email ) , it became clear that the announcement was not the one many political watchers have been expecting for months : that the former secretary of state was running for president in 2016			0
instead , the email urged supporters to donate to the foundation with the promise that " @entity19 , @entity20 , and i will triple every $ 1 donated to the @entity22 before the end of the year , up to an additional $ 100,000			1
" " in my family , we 're celebrating our first holidays with a beautiful new granddaughter , " @entity4 wrote in the email			0
" we 're also celebrating the generosity and commitment of our incredible @entity22 family -- and that means you			0
" @entity4 highlighted a number of her foundation 's initiatives , including @entity38 to fail , a project dedicated to childhood education ; no ceilings , aimed at women and girls achieving full participation around the world ; and @entity46 , an initiative aimed at connecting the unemployed with prospective employers			1
@entity6 joined her husband 's foundation a few months after leaving the state department in early 2013			2
with the addition of @entity4 -- as well as her daughter @entity20 -- the foundation changed its named from the @entity22 to the @entity19 , @entity6 and @entity55			1
according to foundation tax documents released earlier this year , the foundation brought in $ 144.4 million in 2013 , a three-fold growth from the $ 51.5 million the foundation received in 2012			0
the jump was seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case @entity6 runs for president in 2016			2
since joining the effort , @entity6 has also used the foundation as a vehicle to travel the country and deliver high profile speeches .			0
