@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 claims its artillery destroyed much of a military convoy that crossed from @entity5 into @entity1 this week -- an incursion that two @entity8 newspapers say they witnessed			1
if true , @entity1 's account and the @entity8 reports appear to give credence to what @entity0 has long alleged -- that @entity5 has been sending troops and arms into eastern @entity1 , where @entity16 rebels have battled the @entity1 military for months			1
a diplomatic row was brewing friday over the reports , with the @entity8 's foreign office summoning @entity5 's ambassador in @entity21 to explain the incident			1
@entity5 's foreign ministry has denied any such incursion , and its foreign minister will meet in @entity27 with his counterparts from @entity1 , @entity29 and @entity30 on sunday , state - run news agency @entity23 reported			1
the meeting 's agenda was n't immediately released			0
meanwhile , a separate @entity5 convoy -- more than 200 trucks that @entity35 says contain relief goods for civilians in war - torn eastern @entity1 -- remained parked on the @entity5 side of the border , waiting for @entity1 and other inspectors to decide whether to approve the aid 's entry			1
that @entity1 so far has blocked the aid reflects @entity0 's concerns -- held even before thursday 's reported military incursion -- that @entity5 might try to smuggle more military supplies			1
@entity1 : majority of vehicles destroyed those concerns took on a new light when @entity8 media outlets @entity52 and @entity53 reported that armored personnel carriers , along with other vehicles with @entity5 military plates , crossed the border near @entity58 , @entity1 , on thursday night			1
the @entity52 reported that it witnessed 23 armored personnel carriers , in addition to other vehicles with @entity5 military plates , cross into @entity1 through a gap in a barbed wire fence			1
" armed men were visible in the gloom by the border fence as the column moved into @entity1 , " the @entity52 report reads			2
this is the first time foreign media recorded such an incursion , though it illustrates what @entity0 has said has been happening for months -- that @entity5 has been sending troops and equipment to help the rebels -- @entity1 military col. @entity76 told reporters			1
@entity1 president @entity79 told @entity8 prime minister @entity80 that @entity1 forces destroyed " the majority " of the @entity5 vehicles , @entity79 's office said			1
@entity79 " expressed concern over the situation on the border , particularly over the fact that the inflow of @entity5 arms and military machines in @entity1 through the open part of the border continued , " his office said			1
@entity76 said he did n't know exactly how many vehicles crossed the border , or how many @entity1 's artillery managed to destroy			1
purported humanitarian convoy still in @entity5 back in southern @entity5 , across the border from @entity1 's @entity102 , 59 @entity1 border guards and customs officers were inspecting the scores of trucks that @entity35 says contain aid for civilians affected by fighting , the @entity1 military said			1
despite @entity1 's suspicions , @entity76 said that the aid is needed and that @entity1 would allow the @entity110 to distribute it if @entity1 and the aid group find the material suitable			2
months of fighting has killed hundreds of people and , aid groups say , left thousands in eastern @entity1 without access to water , electricity and proper medical aid			2
the @entity110 is trying to establish what exactly is in the trucks , @entity119 , a @entity110 spokesman in @entity0 , said			0
the @entity110 " will temporarily deploy additional personnel to @entity1 and @entity5 for the purpose of this operation and is already in the process of identifying its staff ready for deployment , " @entity119 said			2
" a four - member team is already present today in the vicinity of the convoy , and more staff are on their way			0
" @entity35 says the trucks contain grain , sugar , baby food , medical supplies and sleeping bags			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , says it is distributing its own aid through the @entity110			0
the @entity0 - recognized governor of @entity102 , @entity141 , said this week that she does n't want aid from @entity5			0
" they send us tanks and @entity146 ( rocket - launching vehicles ) overnight and offer to send humanitarian aid by day , " she said			0
battle rages on tens of thousands of @entity1 troops have recently stepped up efforts to retake areas in and around @entity102 , @entity58 and @entity154 , three cities held by rebels for months			0
@entity58 has been the scene of intense shelling for days as rebels try to hold off @entity1 forces			0
eleven civilians were killed in a 24 - hour period straddling thursday and friday , the @entity58 mayor 's office said			0
many districts were without power and water , the mayor 's office said			0
a @entity2 crew that was in @entity58 earlier noted that the shelling had pushed some residents underground into cellars and half - built basements			0
five @entity1 troops were killed in the past day , @entity173 said friday , adding that some rebels were retreating , trying to dig in closer to the @entity1 - @entity5 border			2
the ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with a political crisis over whether @entity1 would seek closer ties with @entity180 or @entity5 -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern @entity1 since mid-april , according to estimates from @entity184 officials			2
the @entity185 and the @entity186 have applied steadily increasing sanctions against @entity5 officials , banks and other interests since march , when @entity5 annexed the @entity192 @entity1 peninsula of @entity193			2
@entity5 's move came a month after @entity1 's parliament ousted @entity197 president @entity196			2
@entity196 left office after violent protests against his government in the capital , @entity0			0
those protests were motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the @entity186 in favor of closer ties with @entity5			0
aid or invasion ? question looms as @entity5 convoy nears @entity1 opinion : why @entity212 is n't going to make peace journalist @entity214 reported from @entity0 , @entity2 's @entity215 reported and wrote from @entity216 , and @entity2 's @entity217 reported and wrote from @entity218			1
@entity2 's @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
