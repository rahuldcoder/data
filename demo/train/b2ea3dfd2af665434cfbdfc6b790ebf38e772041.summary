@entity0 is the author of " @entity1 : a @entity2			1
" he is @entity3 and @entity4 at @entity5 in @entity6			0
his web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com / @entity0 says protesters in @entity1 would be harmed by @entity10 aid to " promote democracy " in that nation			1
( @entity13 ) -- on a number of occasions and in perfectly pitched and calibrated statements , president @entity14 has expressed his unequivocal support for the civil rights movement in @entity1 without appearing to interfere in @entity1 domestic affairs			1
this has been particularly admirable given the pressure that is coming his way from a @entity24 that -- up until the night before the @entity1 presidential election -- was discussing even more severe economic sanctions on @entity1 , which would have hurt precisely the young men and women the legislators now seem too eager to support			2
@entity14 can help this budding seed of hope for civil liberties even more emphatically by altogether cutting the budget " to promote democracy in @entity1 , " evidently channeled through the @entity34			1
@entity36 of @entity37 reports , " the @entity14 administration is moving forward with plans to fund groups that support @entity1 dissidents			2
" this financial aid is not only a waste of taxpayer money under these severe economic circumstances , but is in fact the surest way to kill that inborn and grassroots movement			1
it mostly will be abused by expatriate and entirely discredited opposition groups ranging from the monarchist supporters of @entity53 to the members of the @entity55 , and it will in turn strengthen the hand of the regime to denounce the @entity59 as funded by @entity10			0
the @entity10 government should n't give a penny to these groups or any other outlet dedicated to promoting " democracy in @entity1 " from the sunny coasts of @entity65 to the green suburbs of @entity67			1
as the whole world is now a witness to it , the civil rights movement in @entity1 is a nonviolent demand to exercise people 's constitutional rights to participate in the democratic aspirations of their homeland , turned bloody only by the custodians of an @entity80 republic who seem to be too conscious of their own illegitimacy			1
this movement has been decades , if not centuries , in the making			0
and it needs no @entity10 money to sustain itself			2
the only thing it needs is the moral voice of the @entity10 civil rights movement to come to its aid			1
just one quote from the rev. @entity94 ( or more accurately from the prominent 19th century abolitionist @entity95 ) about the arc of the moral universe being long , but ultimately bending toward justice , will go a long way toward supporting this movement			0
if i were the president , i would reallocate that budget and spend it on enriching inner city public schools , enabling them to develop courses on modern @entity1 and @entity80 history			2
i would convene a national convention with the first lady presiding in which public high school teachers would be brought together to think through curricular changes that would teach the next generation of @entity10 more about the world in which they have to live			0
from the same fund i would establish an annual prize for 100 best essays on a contemporary @entity80 society written by a junior from a public high school			0
a prize could be applied to college tuition			0
i would call it the @entity123 - @entity122			0
not just one but four swords of @entity125 are now hanging over the @entity1 civil rights movement			1
one of them , the severe crackdown by the custodians of the @entity80 republic , has already dropped ruthlessly			0
@entity1 are more than capable of dodging it and continuing with creative ways of civil disobedience and nonviolent strategies of pushing forward from their versions of the @entity137 , @entity138 , bus boycott of 1955 - 1956 to their @entity140			2
but the other three swords are held over this movement from outside @entity1 , in fact from the @entity10 government			1
these are 1 ) the misappropriation of funds to promote democracy in @entity1 that will in fact abort it ; 2 ) the fear of even more severe economic sanctions that will do nothing to the ruling elite except exacerbate its belligerence while hurting the very brave men and women daring the brutality of their government ; and 3 ) the threat of military strike that , should it materialize , will have this hopeful uprising as its very first target while creating the condition of an open military coup in @entity1 , turning it to another @entity167			1
the @entity10 can only lead , if it must , by example , by practicing what it preaches			0
our inner schools can not suffer from unfathomable poverty of educational tools while we allocate millions of dollars to useless , ineffective , discredited " oppositional " forces			0
whatever the fate of the @entity80 republic , the noble cause of civil liberties will remain constant in @entity1 and will emerge as a model for the region			2
by wedding the freshly cut flower of @entity184 's young life in the fertile soil of @entity123 ' memory , @entity1 and @entity10 will finally come together in their common dreams of basic human decency			1
and what better president to have a hand in that union than the man who is a beneficiary of the courage and imagination of @entity123 and a witness to @entity122 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			0

@entity0 : @entity10 government planning millions to aid democracy in @entity1
he says the money could discredit and kill the @entity1 protest movement
he says the money should be spent to improve schools in @entity10
@entity210 : @entity1 protesters need inspiration from civil rights movement , not money
