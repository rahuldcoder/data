-- an @entity2 court may render the final verdict thursday in the case of @entity5 , sentenced to death by stoning in @entity2 for allegedly committing adultery			1
that case was placed under review after her attorney , @entity10 , helped launch a worldwide campaign to clear her			1
now , as @entity5 's two children wait to hear word of their mother 's fate , @entity10 's family must also await word of his			2
that 's because @entity10 , a prominent human rights lawyer , was being held wednesday at a detention center in @entity22 , @entity23 , where he has requested asylum , said @entity25 , a representative in @entity23 for the @entity26 high commissioner for refugees			1
he allegedly entered the country with improper documentation , the agency said			0
@entity23 does not require visas for citizens from neighboring @entity2 to enter the country			1
as a result , it is the first place hundreds of @entity2 fled to after the @entity2 government cracked down on opposition activists and critics over the past year			2
human rights groups are urging officials to grant his asylum request because they say he could be in grave danger if he is forced to return to @entity2			1
there is no word yet on whether any nation is willing to accept him			0
@entity10 went into hiding july 24 , after facing a lengthy interrogation at @entity2 's notorious @entity49 , the same day rallies were being held worldwide to draw attention to the @entity5 case			1
his wife and brother - in - law were reportedly arrested that night at his office in @entity55 as they tried to gather his belongings			2
the @entity2 government has since released @entity10 's brother - in - law , but human rights groups said they are holding his wife as collateral until @entity10 returns			1
in a now widely circulated open letter reportedly penned by @entity10 and posted on the internet , the lawyer accused @entity2 authorities of holding his wife " hostage			1
" he also explained why he made the painful choice of leaving his wife behind			0
" despite the arrest of the person i love most in my life , i decided not to ever set foot in a judicial office where the interrogators do not abide by any basic laws , " he wrote			0
" hostage taking is never legal " @entity10 said			2
" i decided not to appear unless the interrogator 's office tries hard enough to come and arrest me in my silo that i have built for myself			0
" @entity10 was asked by @entity0 in early july if he was worried about his safety after bringing so much attention to @entity5 , who was convicted of adultery in 2006 and condemned to die by the brutal method of stoning			2
@entity10 told @entity0 that he knew the risks -- he had been detained briefly after @entity2 's post-election turmoil in june 2009 -- but that would not stop him fighting for human rights			1
but it was that very fight that forced him to flee the country he calls home			0
as part of that open letter , @entity10 cried out to the @entity2 government -- and to @entity94 -- for the strange twist in his fate			1
" for the past few years all my thoughts have been towards saving people who did not deserve to die			0
" i was so occupied with saving these people that i hardly got to see my dear wife and daughter			0
... and for someone who has always worked towards justice and the interests of the @entity105 , is this the way i am paid back for my @entity94 - loving and human - loving actions ? " " i leave you and your interrogator at the mercy of @entity94 , the creator , " he continued			2
" i hope that you wo n't let my child cry for her mother , not eating food and wanting her mother back			0
she needs to hug her mother			0
if through this separation from her mother she gets hurt , it 's a sin that you have committed			0
" the @entity2 government has not commented on the detention of @entity10 's wife			1
meanwhile , human rights activists are urging the international community not to forget @entity5 , who may soon die			1
nor the man who tried to set her free			0
@entity0 's @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
