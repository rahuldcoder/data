, @entity1 may very well owe its force to an emerging business and technology district in the heart of @entity7 , centered around an upscale avenue called @entity9 in the neighborhood of @entity11			1
the modern buildings of @entity21 in @entity11 line the marginal highway along the @entity23			0
" there 's been a transformation from a sleepy outpost in @entity7 to perhaps the city 's most dynamic area in terms of new growth , new buildings and new companies , " observes @entity24 , the founding editor of @entity25 , an online travel guide to @entity1			1
of course , this transformation did n't happen overnight			0
development began in the 1930 's , from a quaint rural outpost to a middle - class residential neighborhood of predominantly single - family , chalet - style homes of @entity43 and @entity44 expatriates , alongside a favela			0
the commercial growth of @entity11 -- named after the now - defunct @entity48 trolley - car line which terminated in that neighborhood -- began with the general movement of banks from @entity52 to @entity1 's biggest city near the country 's newly established ( yet diplomatically dull ) capital of @entity56 in 1960			1
in the following decades , more brands and businesses moved over from @entity52 to @entity7 , hotels took over vacant lots , and the favela was razed to make way for more office buildings			0
while residential ( as well as dining and nightlife ) development has been slow to develop in comparison , the influx of outsiders and renewal of generations has resulted in a stimulating mix of new residents and commuters			0
" since the development of the late 1990 's , @entity9 is becoming the fourth downtown of @entity7 , after @entity52 , @entity77 ( a symbol of the 20th century city ) and @entity80 [ in neighboring @entity23 ] , " says @entity24 , who lived in @entity1 from 1986 to 2008 , most of that time in @entity11			1
today , the region around @entity82 hosts a quorum of high - technology multinational firms and their executives , including @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , and even @entity95 and @entity96			2
but perhaps more telling is the shift of headquarters of @entity1 's largest and internationally renowned media conglomerate , @entity100 , from its traditional home in @entity52 to its new stronghold in @entity11 , @entity7			1
other @entity1 media and it giants such as @entity105 and @entity106 have also set up shop on @entity82 , with a slew of software start - ups filling in the side - streets			1
so is @entity9 set to be @entity1 's own up - and - coming @entity111 ? " i think it 's overblown to call it a @entity111 , " responds @entity24			1
" @entity1 has a problem in terms of it with fairly restrictive laws on the importation of hardware , which just makes everything more expensive			0
the price of any computer is about twice as much as in the @entity123 even local manufacturers do n't charge cut - rate prices , because they know they can get a free ride [ on the market rates ]			0
" but if general access to hardware hinders distribution , @entity24 agrees that software for web and mobile development is soaring			0
this should come as no surprise , given that @entity1 is the world 's fifth - largest country in both area and population , and ranks fifth worldwide in number of mobile phone and @entity142 users			2
mobile mecca with a population of 190 million , @entity1 registered over 152 million mobile phones ( of which 3.2 million 3g devices ) as of february 2009 , resulting in a market penetration rate of 80 percent , according to the @entity1 telecommunications portal @entity149			1
@entity149 also reports that @entity1 's four major carriers -- @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 -- together hold 91 percent of the market			2
and let us not forget , @entity7 is the world 's fourth - largest city , as well as @entity1 's biggest and richest megalopolis			1
among the foreign companies with their foot in the door of this exploding online and mobile market is the year - old start - up @entity164 -- headquartered in the @entity166 , with its first overseas office in @entity7 -- which offers a free , mobile solution for instant messaging , @entity171 calling , file sending and social networking through existing platforms			1
" @entity164 is located about five minutes from @entity82 , " says @entity175 , @entity164 's @entity1 marketing analyst			0
" many direct - to - consumer companies ( @entity177 ) , operators , internet companies and general technology companies are located around @entity9 , so the location has helped in meeting new opportunities and building business relationships more frequently , with companies that relate directly to @entity164 's core business			2
" but while some 152 million @entity1 may have a mobile handset , a staggering 80 percent of them use a pre-paid phone card , making the public 's investment in mobile services a challenge			1
@entity164 , however , remains optimistic about evolving mentalities , as the company 's @entity82 branch focuses on shifting @entity1 ' already buzzing online activity to their handheld devices			0
" the online social habits of the @entity1 population match @entity164 features , mainly with @entity200 and @entity201 , but with good participation also from @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and others , " says @entity175			0
just around the corner from the @entity164 office is @entity210 , another year - old start - up , which offers an online space for @entity1 to interact and share with each other , beginning with a user - generated question - and - answer service			2
like @entity164 , the company may be starting small , but unlike global models such as @entity217 , @entity210 has the advantage of being born and raised in @entity11 .			0

@entity220 in @entity11 , @entity7 , is @entity1 's up - and - coming high - tech *hub*
commercial transformation began with economic shift to @entity7 in 1960 's
@entity9 is home to both foreign and local multinational brands and software start - ups
@entity1 has an exploding mobile - phone penetration rate of 80 percent
