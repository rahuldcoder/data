@entity0 , @entity1 -- here 's something liberals and conservatives have in common : it may soon be the case that neither camp will have @entity8 to kick around anymore			2
now it 's time to give @entity10 , @entity11 , voters a chance to do some kicking of their own			0
we can start with those @entity16 who support immigration reform and believe that both @entity18 and the @entity20 administration should be ashamed for putting off a tough debate for the sake of politics			1
these folks might soon have a chance to channel that anger at a @entity28 insider who those closest to the immigration debate have always seen as one of the main obstacles to reform -- @entity8			1
that is , if there is any truth to what various news outlets are reporting this week -- that the @entity39 chief of staff will soon resign and head home to @entity10 to run for mayor			1
if he does , the immigration issue will be waiting to greet him			0
that will be especially true if @entity46 rep. @entity45 , perhaps the most outspoken supporter of comprehensive immigration reform in @entity18 , also jumps into the mayor 's race			1
this is a real possibility , and , if it happens , we can expect fireworks : @entity45 has never been shy about blasting @entity8 over immigration reform			1
when it comes to what is perhaps the most divisive issue that @entity59 have confronted since slavery , @entity8 should have learned by now that you can run but you ca n't hide			1
he has been on the run from immigration reform since the debate resurfaced in 2005 with the introduction of the @entity67 comprehensive reform bill			1
@entity8 spent that year whipping up support among @entity46 for the @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 , a terribly unimaginative enforcement - only bill proposed by then - @entity74 chairman @entity73 , @entity75			0
among other things , the bill made unauthorized presence in the @entity59 a felony and threatened to punish , as accomplices , churches and other charities that offer assistance to illegal immigrants			0
the measure passed the @entity39 , but the @entity85 never acted on it			0
in 2006 , when @entity46 took control of both houses of @entity18 , @entity8 became house speaker @entity89 's top lieutenant			0
there again , he worked hard to keep the immigration issue off the @entity46 agenda because he feared it could put him and his colleagues in a tough spot			0
according to the @entity96 , @entity8 decided that the issue was a loser for @entity46 and so he tried to bury it			2
@entity8 failed the leadership test , even if he was correct in his political analysis			0
the issue divided two loyal @entity46 constituencies : @entity103 , who wanted reform , and organized labor , which did n't want reform if it meant supporting demands from the business community for guest workers			2
unions claimed guest workers undermined @entity59 workers			0
it left liberal @entity46 vulnerable , because immigration is one of those issues where some of their liberal constituents sound more like conservatives			0
it also threatened " blue dog " @entity46 representing conservative districts , several of whom @entity8 had personally recruited to run for @entity18 in the first place			2
it was no surprise when the @entity10 @entity126 declared immigration the new " third rail " in politics ( you touch it , you die ) and pushed the issue so far to the back burner that it nearly fell off the stove			1
@entity137 newspapers reported shouting matches between @entity8 and members of the @entity46 - controlled @entity140 , who failed to get leaders of their party to tackle the issue			2
@entity8 continued ducking the immigration issue when he became president @entity20 's chief of staff in early 2009 , and it might be that he has helped @entity20 do the same thing			1
despite repeated promises that he intends to achieve comprehensive immigration reform ( these promises are usually delivered before @entity153 audiences on @entity155 holidays ) , @entity20 has been derelict			1
while the president was willing to go the mat for health care reform , he obviously does n't care as much about immigration			2
in fact , as tempting as it is to blame @entity8 for taking immigration reform off the president 's agenda , it might not be totally fair			1
some in the immigration reform community naively assume that the only reason they have n't gotten as much as they expected from this administration is because @entity8 has been secretly plotting against their interests			1
it 's better to believe that than to take a peek behind door no. 2 and accept the hard truth that @entity20 is the one who betrayed them			0
either way , @entity8 has a lot of explaining to do to @entity103 when he gets back to @entity10 about his commitment to the immigration issue -- or lack thereof			1
they deserve answers , and they should demand them			0
and if the response does n't satisfy their concerns , they should take their votes elsewhere			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

@entity192 notes @entity8 may run for @entity10 mayor
immigration reformers there may be *unimpressed* with his past obstruction on issue , he says
if rep. @entity45 , immigration reform supporter , also decides to run , expect fireworks
@entity192 : @entity8 did n't lead on immigration ; his boss , the president , also derelict on issue
