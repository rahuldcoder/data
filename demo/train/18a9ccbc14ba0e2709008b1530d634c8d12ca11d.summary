-- eight people who shared a flight with tuberculosis - infected traveler @entity3 on may 24 filed suit thursday against him in a @entity8 court			1
@entity10 patient @entity3 set off an international health scare when he traveled to @entity12 for his wedding in may			1
@entity14 reported the suit , filed in @entity16 , seeks $ 1.3 million ( canadian $ 1.4 million ) in damages			1
speaker , a 31 - year - old @entity19 , @entity20 , lawyer , caused an international uproar when he disregarded doctors ' advice and traveled abroad to get married , potentially exposing his fellow passengers to the disease			1
speaking with @entity0 from a hospital in @entity28 , @entity29 , where he is undergoing treatment , @entity18 said he is aware of the pending litigation but has not heard from his attorney in @entity34 , @entity8			2
" i am not some trust - fund baby , and there is nothing to go after , " he said			0
@entity38 -- an attorney for the plaintiffs who said her clients include a ninth person related to one of the passengers but who was not on the flight -- said all eight passengers have undergone tb tests since they returned home			0
one of them , a 72 - year - old man , tested positive for @entity10 on a skin test , though it was not clear that @entity18 was the source			0
the man 's x-rays were normal , she said , and he is awaiting results of further tests			0
speaker and his fiancee flew to @entity12 may 12 , despite warnings from the @entity62 in @entity20 that he should not fly because he was infected with a multidrug - resistant strain of the bacteria called @entity65			1
once there , the @entity67 said , test results back in @entity20 indicated he had a rare , more serious strain of the tuberculosis bacilli called extensively drug - resistant @entity10 , or @entity71			2
that news led @entity74 public health officials to try to persuade speaker to turn himself in to @entity77 health authorities so that he would not risk infecting others			1
speaker has said he disregarded their recommendation and returned to @entity82 on a commercial flight from @entity84 to @entity34 because he had been told he was not infectious , he could not afford to hire a private plane , and he was afraid that , if he were to remain in @entity77 , he would not be able to get the cutting - edge treatment available in the @entity74			2
speaker was allowed on may 24 to cross from @entity8 into the @entity74 at @entity88 , @entity89 , despite a warning from the @entity67 to border agents that he posed a public health threat and that a @entity67 doctor should be alerted if speaker were to seek entry			1
the @entity97 officer said he let speaker enter the country because the man did not appear sick			0
the officer was suspended and later retired			0
doctors at @entity102 in @entity28 have since determined that speaker is infected with @entity65 , not the more serious @entity71			0
the @entity67 says the change in diagnosis would not have affected their recommendations regarding travel			0
