-- much of the focus this week at the @entity2 , the video game industry 's big annual trade show , will be on @entity5 and @entity6 , which both have new game consoles coming in time for the holiday shopping season			1
but the spotlight inside the @entity10 wo n't be so much on the @entity11 and @entity12 as what 's really important : the games themselves			1
with these two next - generation consoles on the near horizon , game developers are in a transitional period between the new devices and the ones that people enjoy in their homes right now			1
many of the titles featured during @entity2 may be playable immediately , with a next - gen option down the road			1
@entity6 is bringing more than 40 games for its @entity28 and handheld @entity30 as well as the forthcoming @entity12			1
" beyond : two souls , " " @entity32 " and " @entity33 : @entity37 " are just a few of the much - anticipated titles it 'll be featuring			0
and @entity41 , creators of the popular " @entity40 " franchise , will show gameplay from " @entity43 , " a new game			1
" people want to see games , and we are hopefully going to bring a game that people will love , " said @entity45 , senior writer for " @entity43 " and the head of community for @entity41 , the game 's developer			1
" we 've worked really hard , and bleary eyes are starting to give way to smiles			0
it 's just really exciting for us			2
you always wonder what people are going to say			0
" @entity5 purposefully split its @entity11 announcement into two parts so it could focus exclusively on games during @entity2 -- specifically , the 15 exclusive franchises it has promised for the first year of @entity11			1
the company announced monday that the @entity11 will cost $ 499 and go on sale in 21 countries in november			1
while it might appear @entity70 is scaling down its e3 efforts by not holding a showcase event , the game company actually has more events planned than usual			2
it also is appealing directly to consumers by focusing specifically on its software lineup and letting them play new game demos at select @entity81 stores in @entity82			0
@entity83 is another publisher with one foot in the present and one in the future			0
it will be showing off more of " @entity88 : @entity88 , " a title due out in october for all current consoles ( @entity28 , @entity91 , @entity92 )			0
the company will also provide a little taste of its next - gen offering , " @entity95 , " at @entity2			2
@entity96 , ceo of @entity97 , said his company did n't wait around for details on the new consoles but began development on its game years ago with an eye to what could be			2
@entity96 said he believes all that advance planning is going to pay off and people will see the results during the show			0
other companies are also looking forward to getting their titles on the @entity2 global stage			2
and it would n't feel like a complete @entity2 without a new " @entity113 " or " @entity115 " game			1
" @entity113 : ghosts " ( @entity118 / @entity117 ) , the 10th in the blockbuster franchise , will be playable on current and future consoles			0
" @entity123 " ( @entity125 / @entity124 ) will give gamers a first look at its multiplayer mode at @entity2			2

@entity140 , vice president of public relations and marketing for @entity143 , said that his company and others must strike a balance between serving their current fan base ( with " the @entity148 " ) and developing games such as " wolfenstein : the @entity151 " for future consoles			2
" we 're still developing games for what is essentially a moving target , " @entity140 said			0
" i think it is going to be a very fun @entity2 because it is going to be all about the games and very little talk about some of the other stuff			1
" @entity162 also will be making a splash at @entity2 with " @entity164 , " a new entry into the toy figurine / video game genre made popular by the " @entity169 " franchise			1
gamers will be able to play with their favorite @entity162 and @entity172 characters in a video game as well as the toy figurines			1
@entity117 is n't letting @entity162 walk all over its turf though			0
its " @entity179 " will be on display , offering new innovation for the genre			0
in this game , interchangeable halves of characters will challenge players ' creativity while effectively doubling the number of characters you can play in the game			0
@entity2 's trade - show floor opens at noon pt tuesday and runs through thursday			1
it was first held in 1995 and is traditionally a media - only event , although many fans find ways to get in .			0
