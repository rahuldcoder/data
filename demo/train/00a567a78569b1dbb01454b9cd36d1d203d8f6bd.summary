-- may 16 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : i 'm @entity16 , and today on @entity17 , we 're gon na be talking about something that wo n't happen until november 6th ... of 2012 ! but we start things off down in @entity4			1
first up : @entity21 @entity22 : officials facing the threat of massive flooding there have opened several gates on the @entity28			2
a spillway is something that goes over or around a dam			2
it 's a safety feature			1
when too much water builds up around the dam , the spillway 's gates can be opened to let some of that water through			1
this is what the @entity28 looks like normally : gates closed , nothing coming through			2
but with floodwaters from the @entity44 rushing in , engineers opened up some of the spillway 's gates for the first time in nearly 40 years			1
that 's what you see here : water barreling through the gate			1
the @entity28 has 125 total gates			2
officials plan to open up to one - fourth of those			2
opening the gates should divert floodwaters away from major cities , like @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity4			1
but it will send water toward homes and farmland in other parts of the state			2
people who live there -- many of whom have had to evacuate their homes -- are preparing for devastation			2
@entity70 , @entity71 , louisiana resident : it 's worse than we thought			1
it 's really worse than we thought			1
we thought maybe we might have water in our yard			2
instead , this is going to come into our home			2
it 's going to take everything we have got			1
presidential politics @entity22 : the next @entity84 presidential election is more than 500 days away			0
might sound like the distant future , but there 's a lot that happens between now and then			1
and since that process is already underway , we 're going to break some of it down for you today			1
ultimately , one candidate from each party will face off in the general election			0
that 's on november 6th , 2012			1
before that , candidates have to win their party 's nomination			1
that 's what the primary elections help decide			1
there are lots of political parties out there			0
the @entity106 , the @entity107			0
we 're going to look at the two biggest parties : the @entity109 and @entity110			0
on the @entity109 side , president @entity111 is an incumbent candidate			0
he 's running for re-election to the office he already holds			1
he announced his campaign last month			0
the @entity110 side has a field of candidates			0
some of them , like former house speaker @entity120 , @entity84 representative @entity121 , and former @entity123 governor @entity122 , have announced their plans to run for president			0
others have formed what are called exploratory committees			0
they have n't officially announced their candidacy , but they 're looking pretty seriously at the possibilities			0
lot of steps to go through between now and election day			0
we 'll take you through it as campaign season rolls along			0
@entity138 @entity139 , @entity14 : today 's first @entity140 goes out to mr. @entity142 's geography students at @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145 ! whose slogan is " the toughest job you 'll ever love " ? here we go ! is it the : a ) @entity153 , b ) @entity154 , @entity155 ) @entity152 or @entity156 ) @entity157 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a promotional campaign described the @entity152 as " the toughest job you 'll ever love			1
" that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity152 at 50 @entity22 : the organization promotes peace and friendship by having @entity84 live and work in developing countries			1
a simple idea , but one that 's lasted			1
the @entity152 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year			1
@entity171 caught up with a new member of the corps as she began her journey			1
( begin video ) @entity176 , former u.s. president : i have today signed an executive order providing for the establishment of a @entity152			1
@entity181 , @entity17 anchor : that was march 1961			0
in the 50 years since president @entity176 launched the @entity152 initiative , more than 200,000 volunteers have served in some 139 countries			1
twenty - two - year - old @entity187 is now one of them			0
@entity189 , @entity190 : it 's an exciting thing to be a part of			1
so many amazing people have been @entity152 volunteers , and just the network of people who have done it			1
they use the word " family " a lot			0
it 's exciting to sort of be going into that			1
@entity202 : @entity187 recently earned her college degree in human biology and african studies			0
she plans to put it to good use for the next 27 months in @entity208 , where she 'll work in the @entity152 malaria program			1
@entity210 : professionally , this is going to be sort of the best thing that i can do , in terms of on - the - ground experience and whether i want to work broadly in life or doing policy work			0
and personally , i think it 's going to be the biggest challenge of my life , being in an entirely new culture			1
@entity202 : @entity152 volunteers serve in several areas : education , hiv / aids awareness , agriculture , and business development , just to name a few			1
they are provided with health insurance , a housing allowance , and they receive about $ 7,500 at the end of their 27 - month assignment			0
and the desire to serve is still very strong			0
@entity235 , @entity236 , @entity190 : today , we have more @entity152 volunteers in the field than at any time in the last 40 years			1
and , you know , i think it 's representative that @entity84 are ready to serve			1
they 're answering president @entity111 's call to service			1
@entity202 : forty - seven people in this latest group of @entity152 volunteers are heeding that call			1
@entity249 , @entity190 : i just hope to do stuff , to complete projects that people will appreciate			0
maybe something that 's sustainable , so when i leave they will have it			1
@entity256 , @entity257 : two years seems a lot like now , but in the grand scheme of things , it 's really not that big			1
so , if i can donate a little of my time to try to do some good , i think it 's worth a shot			2
@entity202 : and for @entity187 , she says she is ready for the learning experience of a lifetime			0
@entity210 : one of the goals of the @entity152 is to bring a better understanding of @entity84 to other people around the world			1

and show sort of the good side			0

that 's your answer and that 's your @entity279 ! celebrating civil rights @entity22 : starting with @entity280 , black and white major leaguers played together on the field			1

( begin video ) @entity324 , @entity17 anchor : some of them were out there before you			0
but when you kind of got into the mix , is that something you wanted ? did you ever consider yourself kind of a leader being out front , a leader in the civil rights era ? or did you just want to play baseball ? @entity316 , @entity335 : i wanted to play baseball and i never felt like i was a leader			1
but i felt like @entity280 had paved the way for , and i wanted to be a baseball player			2
let me put it that way			0
and @entity280 had paved the way for all of us			0
when i say all of them , myself , @entity344 and some of the other black who 's came before him and was a little bit younger than he was , had paved the way			2
and i felt like it was my responsibility , not only as a baseball player , but to carry myself in such a way that other blacks would be able to look at me and say , " oh , i not only want to be the same kind of ballplayer that @entity316 was , but i want to carry myself off the field the way that he did			2
" @entity356 : do you ever look back and think , " you know what ? i could have done without it , without the record " ? @entity316 : no , i never did			0
no. i felt like it was my responsibility			0
@entity363 had given me the ability to play baseball			2
i had the world on my shoulders			0
i knew that i could do most anything i wanted to do out on the baseball field			2
and i always felt like i was , it may sound kind of silly , but i always felt like i was surrounded by angels on the baseball field			2
you know , i just felt like there was absolutely nothing that could happen to me			0
