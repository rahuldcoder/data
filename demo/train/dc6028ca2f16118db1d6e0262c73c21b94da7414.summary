editor 's note : @entity2 explores innovative approaches and opportunities in business and society through technology			1
( @entity8 ) -- next month , a giant industry gathering is going to be flooded with virtual - reality experiences : the @entity12 flight simulator ; something that lets users confront a kaiju attack ; an @entity17 - enabled spin on combat training ; even a @entity20 installation that lets you go to a college party			1
but this is n't the line - up for @entity25 — it 's the @entity27			1
after bringing a handful of @entity17 installations to @entity27 in 2014 , the festival 's @entity29 program , which focuses on innovation in filmmaking , is doubling down and bringing in a much larger slate of virtual reality experiences for 2015			1
of the 13 installations in the program , nine feature @entity20 and one of the remaining four — a videogame-esque piece about the @entity39 in 1979 — could have a virtual version one day			1
it 's a slate , senior programmer @entity44 says , that shows @entity20 is " a point of conversation that 's going to be really relevant to festival audiences and filmmakers			1
" " i 've never really seen anything like this where a new technology is so muscularly poised to hit the market , " says @entity44 , who has curated the @entity51 program for nine years			1
" this is the year that we 're really going to get wired into this hardware in a major way			0
it really has the potential to shift the [ filmmaking ] terrain quite a bit in a very significant and deep way			0
" algorithms are great and @entity68 , but they can also ruin lives @entity71 , of course , has been to sundance before			0
in 2012 , a @entity72 made the @entity20 goggles for @entity75 's " immersive journalism " project hunger in @entity76			1
( @entity75 will be back in 2015 with a piece on children in @entity79			1
) last january , festivalgoers got a taste of the space dogfighting game @entity82 : valkyrie on the @entity17 , and multimedia artist @entity84 brought an immersive version of his " @entity89 " @entity88 concert that was a hit with fans			0
he 'll also be returning for @entity91			0
in the months since the last festival in @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity71 experiences have become the ultimate crowd - pleaser at all kinds of industry events			2
@entity99 brought a @entity101 experience to @entity102 in march			0
then , after @entity71 ' $ 2 billion acquisition by @entity104 , @entity105 one - upped @entity99 with a @entity107 - piloting simulation at @entity108 this summer			0
and , of course , @entity20 made a huge splash at @entity111 ( again ) this year			0
basically , anywhere there 's been a gathering of people interested in any form of media in the last 12 months , there 's been a @entity20 experience in the offing			2
and now that virtual reality is also coming in the form of @entity122 and @entity123 's @entity20 the demonstrations are just beginning			1
( some of @entity27 's @entity51 offerings are being presented in @entity122 and on @entity123 's device			1
) what would your @entity130 , @entity129 ? 14 people find out part of the appeal of these @entity20 installations , of course , is that the @entity17 is still in developer - only mode — there 's not a consumer version yet			1
for the time being , it 's a cool novelty to tell your colleagues about as you hang up another conference badge and get back to work			2
but @entity91 is a unique case : a lot of the @entity51 projects are made by filmmakers — people who see virtual reality as a new way to experience movies , not just promote them			1
creation is the prime mover here , not ancillary marketing			0
so , what 's in the offing ? for starters , @entity84 is back with a collaboration he did with @entity162 firm @entity161 and production house @entity163 called evolution of @entity166 , a @entity169 " journey from beginning to new beginning " using @entity122			2
then there 's @entity171 ! , which puts you in a city as monsters are about to lay it to waste			2
@entity178 's @entity79 will explore @entity20 's potential as a documentary tool — putting viewers on the ground in the war - torn country to show the effects of the conflict there on children			2
artists @entity189 and @entity191 will also be showing a series of live - action experiences , including one that lets users sit in the room while a pianist works on music			2
[ @entity200 — they brought this to @entity102 last year , and it remains one of the most surprisingly intimate experiences we 've seen on the @entity17			2
] and , in what might be the most thought - provoking piece at @entity29 , the program also will get a @entity20 experience from a @entity27 vet @entity208 , who @entity44 says " wanted to make a piece about date rape and do it in a way where there was a lot of gray zones			1
" the director , who first came to the film festival 21 years ago with the black - and - white lesbian dramedy @entity219 , teamed up with @entity222 whiz @entity220 ; chapter i : @entity224			2
it 's a @entity20 experience that takes a fairly conventional premise — awkward college students hanging out at a party — and turns it into a first - hand experience where a girl and guy " meet , drink , and misinterpreted signals turn into things that can not be undone			2
" on paper , @entity208 and may 's piece sounds like the kind of @entity20 effort that could be as emotionally affecting as any film			1
and the rest of the slate beyond @entity242 reads like any independent film festival line - up			2
remove the words " virtual reality , " and the subject matter has the kind of resonance any indie fest programmer would be proud of : documentaries , a story about a father 's time in the military in @entity255 , a look into the lives of @entity259 yak herders			1
sounds like a main competition line - up at @entity27 , not specifically the @entity29 one			1
filmmaking is just filmmaking , @entity20 just gives it a new theater — one that @entity91 's trendy - scarf - clad film nerds might finally be starting to see themselves in			1
" last year people were putting on the @entity268 and the first thing filmmakers are looking for is image quality , and that 's where filmmakers wondered , ' this is really cool , but what about what it looks like ? ' " @entity44 says			2
" but now the technology has ramped up to a stage where it 'll be wholly embraced by filmmakers			0
" check out the full line up for @entity29 , which runs jan. 22 to feb. 1 during the @entity27 , below			1
