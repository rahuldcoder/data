-- embracing the hair you 're born with sounds like it should be the easiest thing in the world , but for some , it 's a huge challenge			1
@entity7 , a 29 - year - old licensed psychotherapist whose own journey to hair acceptance has grown from a passion into a business , knows that hurdle all too well			1
as the founder of @entity15 , @entity13 now confidently boasts a lush , natural texture that lives up to her online nickname , " @entity18			1
" on her website , she leads the charge for a community of women seeking a resource and a space where they can let their hair down , just as it is , no straightening required			2
but @entity13 can vividly recall the days when straight hair meant beautiful hair , and if she could n't be seen with it straight , she 'd rather not go out at all			1
as a young adult , @entity13 would feel " gorgeous " and " ready " to take on the world when her dark hair 's natural twists and turns were straight , sleek and swinging thanks to a stylist 's heat tools			1
but when that style fell flat and the frizz began to appear , " i would become an introvert ; i did n't want to do anything , " she said			0
eventually , the boyfriend who was driving her to and from hair appointments -- and who 's now her husband and father to their 2Â½ - year - old daughter -- intervened			2
" he said , ' this is n't healthy			0
i do n't know if you 've noticed , but you need to step back and assess this			0
you 're pretty , and i want you to feel pretty no matter what the condition of your hair is , ' " @entity13 recalled			1
" and he was right			0
my hair was running my life			2
my confidence was in flux with my hair			2
" that conversation inspired @entity13 to take action , and she soon found herself researching ways she could work with the kind of hair she was born with			1
once she unchained herself from her flat iron , she found not only a more genuine confidence but a new freedom to live her life as she chose -- not as her hairstyle mandated			2
" once you get to that freedom , " she said , " you 'll be very excited to help those around you achieve that as well			0
" @entity13 has been lending that helping hand on @entity15 for the past four years , and she recently compiled her accumulated wealth of hair care know - how into a book , " @entity81 : the @entity82 to @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85			1
" @entity13 describes the guide as a little like " @entity87 , " mixed with the approachable , easy - to - understand wisdom she extends on the @entity90			1
depending on the person , opting to wear one 's hair in its natural state can feel like a rebirth of sorts			1
some women may choose to cut much of their hair off -- doing a " big chop , " as it 's called -- to get rid of heat - damaged or chemically straightened locks			1
for others like @entity13 , who opted to wear her hair more naturally but skipped the dramatic haircut , there 's still a learning curve to figure out how to wear one 's natural hair texture			1
" in my house , " @entity13 said , " any time we had somewhere important to go , if it was @entity112 ( or ) @entity113 , we had to make sure our hair was pressed and braided neatly			1
that 's what my mom knew , that 's what her mom knew , so we did n't even question it			0
" by the time she was in middle school , @entity13 would want to " shrink into a hole " at the salon while she waited for a stylist to blow dry her freshly washed hair			1
" i did n't want people to see my hair			0
i could n't even look at myself in the mirror , " she recalled			0
" i did n't even know what my real texture looked like			0
... i just knew that if it got a little bit wet , or if i sweat ( ed ) a little bit too much , i put my hands into my roots , and it felt terrible			0
" as a result , @entity13 had to do both a habitual and a mental shift when she decided that having healthy hair was more important			1
that new way involved regularly trimming her hair herself and wearing what she calls " low - manipulation " styles , like buns , which meant she was n't putting added stress on her hair with constant washing and styling			1
celebrity hairstylist and salon owner @entity155 concurs with @entity13 's careful , routine trimming , which he says is essential whether you chemically straighten your hair or are as natural as can be			1
" sometimes women , when they get a relaxer , they do n't want to get a haircut , but that 's part of the service for us , " @entity155 said			2
" getting your ends trimmed is essential in growing your hair and making your hair so that it 's in better shape			2
hair will split after a period of time , and that 's sometimes where thinning hair comes from			2
" it took @entity13 about a year and a half to get rid of her damaged bits , and at the time , she was simultaneously working on being able to leave the house with her new , natural ' do			1
at first , " you have that spotlight effect , because you think everybody 's staring at you , because you 're very self - conscious , " @entity13 said			1
" and most people are n't staring at you , and if they are , maybe they 're thinking good things , not the negative things you 're projecting onto them			0
" on her site and particularly in her book , @entity13 emphasizes how necessary confidence is to the process			1
" this is your hair , and people have to accept it because you do			0
and when you exude that confidence , people get that from you and they do n't bother you			0
often , we have to fake it till we make it , because people will be able to detect that insecurity			0
" the phrase " natural hair " is thrown around a lot , and it can mean different things to different people			1
there are those who would agree with celebrity stylist @entity212 , for whom being natural starts with the product			0
" being a hairdresser , i look for two things : i look for performance , and i look for ingredients			0
it 's hard to find completely 100 % natural hair care that has the performance that you need , but technology is becoming so advanced that the chemists know how to alter ingredients that make it have the performance , " said @entity212 , who 's worked with stars like @entity221 and @entity222			1
for example , if you 're a curly , you might want to check out coconut oil to use as a conditioner , @entity212 said , in an effort to rebuild the hair and get a softer texture			2
" my advice to anybody : read the label and educate yourself , " @entity212 said			0
" i 'm not an extremist			0
i 'm not anti this or that ; i just like to make more conscious decisions in my life			0
" @entity13 , too , cautions against the perception that maintaining natural hair means standing against chemical straighteners or straight hair overall			1
" it 's all about achieving versatility and achieving healthy hair and achieving the freedom to be able to wear your hair curly or straight , " she said			2
" the goal that i had for myself was to feel just as attractive and just as professional and sexy with my hair curly as i felt when it was straight			0
i 'm there in that place now , and i want other women to be able to experience that too			0
that level of confidence , we call it genuine self - esteem -- the kind that does n't fluctuate			0
" there 's also a side benefit to all of that confidence , @entity13 added			1
" accepting what your hair does naturally will help you attain a better quality of life , " she said			2
" you can straighten your hair and do whatever you want to do , because we 're women ; we like to change it up			0
it 's that key of getting comfortable in your own skin			0
my quality of life has greatly improved now that my first thought and consideration is not my hair			2
