-- @entity1 's got a lot of reasons to smile this week			1
first off , he 's married to @entity4 ©			0
still ! but more immediately , the man 's latest effort , @entity5 , is killing it commercially : soundscan reports that the album moved a blockbuster 527,000 copies in its first week , giving @entity1 the 13th no. 1 album of his career			1
@entity0 : @entity1 shoots video at art gallery that number exceeds the high - profile bows of @entity19 's @entity18 ( 339,000 its first week out ) , and @entity21 's @entity20 ( 327,000 )			2
it 's still , however , lower to the year 's biggest debut , @entity25 's @entity24 , which notched 968,000			0
regardless , @entity1 himself ( plus the @entity27 ) considers @entity5 to be already platinum thanks to the downloads its @entity30 app garnered , so there 's that too			2
@entity0 : @entity1 's ' @entity5 ' - what do you think ? and there 's yet another front @entity1 has dominated : @entity35			1
