-- the civil war in @entity3 is morphing into a fight between ethnic and religious factions , the @entity1 said thursday			0
" as battles between government forces and anti-government armed groups approach the end of their second year , the conflict has been overtly sectarian , " the @entity1 @entity6 reported			1
the commission , tasked by the @entity13 to report on @entity3 , made the assessment in one of its periodic reports compiled from interviews			2
this review covered the time from september 28 to december 16			0
the update says government forces and its militias , dominated by @entity23 , have been attacking @entity24 -- who are " broadly ( but not uniformly ) " backing the armed groups opposing president @entity28 's government			1
and anti-government armed groups have been targeting @entity23			1
other minority communities , including some @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , " have also been caught up in the conflict , and in some cases forced to take up arms for their own defense or to take sides			1
" but the " sectarian lines fall most sharply " between @entity23 and @entity24			1
" in recent months , there has been a clear shift in how interviewees portray the conflict , " the report said , describing the conflict in sectarian terms			1
one person described shelling by government forces in @entity51 province as fire from positions in " @entity23 villages			1
" another described escalating tension in @entity58 province between @entity59 and @entity24			1
the " increasingly sectarian nature " of the fighting is a motivator for proxy groups fighting in @entity3			2
anti-government armed groups are made up of @entity24 coming from the @entity65 and @entity66 , the report said			1
shiites from other countries are entering the conflict on behalf of @entity3			2
the @entity71 @entity59 group @entity70 said its members are fighting			0
there are reports of @entity76 shiites coming to fight in @entity3 and @entity78 's @entity77 providing " intellectual and advisory support			0
" christian communities spread across @entity3 have been under the gun and on the move			2
@entity84 , for example , once had been home to about 80,000 @entity35 , but the commission said most have escaped to @entity71			0
" the dangers are evident , " the commission said			0
entire communities are at risk of being forced out of the country or of being killed inside the country			2
with communities believing -- not without cause -- that they face an existential threat , the need for a negotiated settlement is more urgent than ever			0
" more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict , including at least 85 on thursday , the opposition @entity99 said			0
in a @entity37 refugee camp , a possible breather government and rebel negotiators at the @entity37 @entity107 forged an agreement to end the fighting in the ethnic powder keg of @entity111 , a densely populated @entity37 refugee camp in @entity112 where fighting has raged			1
@entity114 , a spokesman for the pro-rebel @entity115 , said representatives for @entity3 forces and the @entity119 rebels decided that all armed groups , including the army and the rebels , should withdraw from the camp and leave it as a neutral zone			0
also under the agreement , the pro-government @entity126 is to be dismantled and its weapons surrendered			0
the camp is to be managed by the independent @entity130 and the @entity131			0
but , he said , " the implementation of the truce has been problematic " because of " intermittent " government shelling on @entity111 and clashes on the camp 's outskirts			1
the @entity1 report referenced the @entity37 as one of the groups hit by the civil war			0
when @entity143 , the movement controlling @entity145 , broke with the government this year over its actions , " divisions within the community hardened , " and pro- and anti-government groups emerged			0
last month , mortar attacks killed 20 @entity37 in @entity111 , and both sides blamed the other			2
and a prominent @entity3 - born pro-al - @entity154 was killed			0
airstrikes on sunday in @entity111 killed and wounded residents , damaged a mosque and " left the camp devastated			1
" the assault prompted a denunciation of the government from the @entity162			0
the fighting forced the escape of many people to other places in @entity3 and to @entity71 , but @entity114 said several thousands have returned and some shops are opening			0
many displaced @entity37 have been living for decades in @entity111 , a nearly square - mile district about five miles from the center of @entity112			2
formed in 1957 , the urban enclave is the largest @entity37 refugee community in @entity3			0
@entity172 wants talks but is n't wedded to the @entity28 regime meanwhile , @entity172 , long friendly to the @entity28 regime , is looking past the @entity3 government for a solution			1
@entity172 's president declared thursday that its goal is to end the bloody conflict in @entity3 , not help the nation 's embattled president cling to power at all costs			1
" we are advocating the solution that would prevent the collapse of the region and the continuous civil war , " @entity172 president @entity184 said in @entity185			1
" not retain @entity28 and his regime			2
" @entity193 - @entity172 ties stuck in the past to do that , he said , talks between opposing sides are crucial			1
" first , people should negotiate , agree on how their participation would be guaranteed ... not first destroy everything and then try to negotiate , " @entity184 said			2
@entity200 has not visited @entity185 much in his tenure , and @entity172 does not have " special economic relations " with @entity3 , according to @entity184			1
@entity172 is " not concerned " about @entity28 's fate , he said			1
" we understand what 's going on ( in @entity3 )			0
we know that this family has been in power for 40 years , " he said			0
@entity193 officials have accused @entity172 and @entity209 of blocking tough efforts against @entity28 by vetoing @entity212 resolutions against the @entity3 government			1
