-- do n't ask @entity1 about race			1
in a recent interview with @entity5 on " @entity6 " the comedian was asked about the fact that most of the guests on his web series " @entity11 " have been white males			1
@entity1 's initial response was " it really pisses me off			2
" " people think [ comedy ] is the census or something , it 's got ta represent the actual pie chart of @entity20 , " he said			0
" who cares ? " with his @entity23 commercial , @entity1 is back on the radar , but his comments come at the same time as debate about diversity in comedy			1
" @entity34 " hired its first black female cast member in years after an outcry over the show 's lack of diversity			2
@entity41 writer @entity40 writes that by @entity1 saying , " i have no interest in gender or race or anything like that , " the comic " seems to suggest that any comedian who is not a white male is also not funny , though he 's also likely fed up with the amount of bad comedy he 's been forced to sit through in his ( waning ) career			1
" " which is too bad , because @entity1 is downplaying the work of everyone from @entity50 and @entity51 to @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 , who are all in various stages of their own sitcoms that just might turn out to be the next ' @entity1 , ' " @entity40 writes			0
it 's not the first time @entity1 has faced criticism regarding racial issues			2
when his hit @entity64 series " @entity65 " ended in 1998 , the @entity62 had a feature about how it was a " nonevent " for many in the black community because it had never seemed to capture the black audience because of a perceived lack of diversity			0
" observers said that the lack of ' @entity65 ' fever among blacks is mainly attributable to the almost total absence of minority characters on the @entity80 - based sitcom , " reported @entity62 writer @entity72			0
" some supporting characters -- including an attorney modeled after defense lawyer @entity83 -- have been featured in the last few seasons , but many said the show is still seen as a program that excludes minorities			0
