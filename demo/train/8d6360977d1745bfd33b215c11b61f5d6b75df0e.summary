-- it takes a lot of guts to choose jewelry design over a career in medicine , but then , @entity7 is n't the kind of woman to shy away from challenges			1
shunning the prospect of attending medical to follow her creative side , the young entrepreneur went about transforming a passion for handmade accessories into a flourishing design practice based in @entity18 's capital , @entity19			1
despite the country 's rich offering of gold and gemstones , @entity7 opted for everyday materials such as wood , seeds and leather to make her pieces			1
the result is a stunning collection of rings , bracelets and necklaces that translate the beauty of @entity18 into wearable art. " [ when ] i started first making jewelry , it started as a hobby " , recalls @entity7			1
" i started making jewelry out of beads , and then later went to study as a goldsmith			0
" she adds , " after studying , i came back and then what i learned as a goldsmith i incorporated it with @entity18 materials to make contemporary @entity18 jewelry			1
" a visit to a @entity49 jewelry shop further inspired @entity7 to dive headfirst into her new venture , and since january 2014 , the business has provided both a rewarding and challenging experience			1
still in her 20s , @entity7 has impressed many with her success , but establishing a new business at a young age is never easy			2
" business has been going ok " , says @entity7			2
" sometimes it 's slow and sometimes it 's high -- [ i 'm ] still trying to find my way , what to do , the how , the do 's and the don'ts ; still trying to figure it out			0
" professional and sleek , @entity67 has the appearance of a high value retailer -- but it 's this very quality that has led some people to question the legitimacy of her work			2
" they 're like ' you 're young , did you really make this ? ' or ' maybe you bought and maybe you 're selling ' " she says			0
nevertheless , @entity7 remains unfazed			0
in fact , the talented designer shows no sign of slowing down			0
" the hopes for my business is to grow it , so it becomes an empire , a jewelry empire everyone will be talking about			2
