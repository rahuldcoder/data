in ruling @entity2 's death penalty unconstitutional , a federal judge said wednesday the system is so broken it unfairly leaves inmates with uncertain fates -- often for decades			1
in his decision , @entity7 - based judge @entity6 vacated the 1995 death sentence of @entity10 , who petitioned the court to determine whether his death sentence was valid			1
@entity6 wrote : " allowing this system to continue to threaten mr. @entity10 with the slight possibility of death , almost a generation after he was first sentenced , violates the @entity14 's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment			1
" the decision will certainly be appealed , said @entity23 legal analysts @entity21 and @entity24			2
@entity21 said no executions could proceed in @entity2 while the decision stands			1
in @entity2 , there are 748 people on death row , the most of any state			2
no executions have been carried out since @entity2 put a moratorium on the death penalty in 2006			1
four years later , the state sought to execute a man who raped and murdered a 15 - year - old girl , but it was blocked by state and federal courts over concerns about lethal injections			0
in wednesday 's ruling , @entity6 called the administration of the state 's death penalty system " dysfunctional			1
" " in @entity2 , the execution of a death sentence is so infrequent , and the delays preceding it so extraordinary , that the death penalty is deprived of any deterrent or retributive effect it might once have had , " he wrote			1
" such an outcome is antithetical to any civilized notion of just punishment			0
" since 1978 , more than 900 people in the state have been sentenced to death row , where inmates spend 23 hours alone in their cells			2
of those people only 13 have been executed ; 94 have died of other causes			0
@entity6 said about 40 % have been on death row longer than 19 years			0
" @entity2 's death penalty system is so plagued by inordinate and unpredictable delay that the death sentence is actually carried out against only a trivial few of those sentenced to death , " @entity6 said , noting that it takes an average of three to five years for a death row inmate just to get an court - appointed attorney for an appeal			1
the judge noted 285 of the people on death row have been there longer than @entity10			1
" there clearly was a crisis coming			0
a lot of people have recognized there is a problem with hundreds of people of death row and hardly any executions , " @entity21 said			2
he noted the situation in @entity2 is so unusual it would n't affect death penalty cases in other states			1
@entity2 's most recent execution was on january 17 , 2006 , according to the website for the state 's @entity88			2
@entity90 , 76 , spent 23 years and one month on death row before dying from a lethal injection			0
he was convicted of orchestrating a triple murder from prison in 1982			0
@entity95 , executive director of the @entity96 and @entity10 's lead attorney , said he was glad that a federal judge reaffirmed what a state commission found in 2008			1
" there is no rational explanation , much less any moral or societal justification , for which people are ultimately executed , " @entity95 said in a written statement			0
" the execution of mr. @entity10 , and the others like him whose meritorious legal claims have gone unheard for decades , serves no valid state interest			2
" the executive director of @entity111 said the law in @entity2 needs to be changed			2
" justice requires that we end this charade once and for all , " said @entity113			0
" it 's time to replace @entity2 's broken death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole			1
that 's the best way to ensure that convicted killers remain behind bars until they die , without wasting tens of millions of tax dollars every year on needless appeals			0
" @entity10 ' case is expected to be appealed by prosecutors to the @entity130 , said			2
@entity131 , a spokesman for state attorney general @entity132 , said her office is reviewing the decision			1
