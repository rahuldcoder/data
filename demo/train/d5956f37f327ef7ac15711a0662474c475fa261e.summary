-- there are few people who can say their job saved them , but former gang member @entity4 says he 's one of them			1
" if i was n't working here i 'd be on the streets looking for problems or , even worse , selling drugs , " @entity4 told @entity0 en @entity5			2
" working here saved my life , " said @entity4 , dressed in his blue uniform and cooking cap			0
the 44 - year - old works as a baker at @entity15 , part of @entity17 in @entity18 , the largest gang rehabilitation program in the country			1
the program was founded in 1992 by father @entity22 , who has counseled and mentored thousands of gang members			1
this month marks @entity4 's one - year anniversary of getting off of drugs and out of the 4th @entity27 gang in @entity18 the youngest of six siblings , he says he joined the gang at age 11 and spent the next 30 years selling drugs , in and out of jail and gang banging			2
it was n't until he started thinking about what his son 's future would look like that he decided to leave the gang life			2
" i knew if i kept going at it , i would be dead or in jail			0
i ca n't believe i wasted all that time , " @entity4 said			0
" and , now i 'm baking pastries with rivals that i would 've never spoken to just last year			0
" @entity17 ' program has been so successful that other gang rehabilitation programs around the country are now looking to them as a model			1
@entity22 hopes to soon launch @entity46 , a yearly conference that would connect programs around the world to share best practices and explore what works for different communities			1
" about 46 programs , in different degrees of progress , have come to us for technical assistance , or we have gone to them to help them set up , " @entity22 told @entity0			1
" and that 's when i thought , what if we were to start a network to help even more people ? " known as the " gang capital " of the nation , @entity18 has more than 450 active gangs with a combined membership of 45,000 people , according to the @entity69			1
few organizations have lasted as long as @entity17 , said @entity71 , director of @entity73 @entity72 , a nonprofit organization helping former prisoners and gang members integrate back into society			1
over the years , @entity71 has partnered and worked closely with @entity17 and @entity22			1
@entity71 returned from the @entity78 to find his neighborhood facing its own street war			0
he founded @entity72 in 1977 to help struggling youth reclaim and restore their lives by providing them with life - enhancing alternatives			2
" when you meet someone like @entity22 , a man of the church , you 're able to sit one on one with him and share that pain with him , it makes you see that we all make mistakes and we can change , " @entity71 sabid			1
according to the study from the @entity98 , six out of 10 gang members who go to @entity17 are able to integrate back into society successfully and stay away from violence and gang - related activity			1
" @entity103 has been so helpful and supportive , " said @entity4			0
" if you want to change , this is the place to start			0
" ex-gang member @entity105 , weary of being in and out of jail , decided to make a positive change and seek out a regular job			0
but extensive tattoo removal from his forehead , cheeks and neck -- a service @entity17 offers -- would be a vital part of the process			1
" i have so many tattoos on my face and hands , i can see why people do n't want to give me a chance , " @entity105 said in an interview with @entity0 en @entity5			2
" looking like this , they 'll think i 'm going to steal their money or things like that			0
" @entity17 has helped thousands of high - risk youths with a variety of free programs : mental health counseling , @entity133 classes , job training and legal services			1
the program 's motto : " nothing stops a bullet like a job			2
" @entity22 says one of the key components of @entity17 is compassion			1
" what if we were to invest in gang members , rather than just seek to incarcerate our way out of this problem ? " @entity22 wrote in his book , " tattoos on the @entity150 : the @entity151			1
" besides @entity152 , other small businesses that serve as a transitional employers for those ready to leave the gang life include @entity157 , @entity158 , and the @entity159 in the @entity161 terminal at @entity162			2
gang membership in @entity164 is still going up , said civil rights attorney and gang prevention expert @entity165 , but many gang members also want out , and @entity22 's connection to the @entity169 has made an impact among @entity171			1
" latino gangs are very different from @entity174 gangs in that if you are allowed to leave it 's only if you are going to go with @entity178 , " she said			0
" the influence of the @entity169 in the @entity181 culture is so powerful			0
" @entity182 , who started out as a baker at @entity15 after leaving an @entity18 gang , is now lead substance - abuse counselor for @entity17			1
he said most gang members " really want to have a life that is better and more stable , but they just do n't know how to get out of the gang life			1
" " but when a person has a reason to wake up in the morning and come to work ...			0
they 're already on a path for change , " said @entity192 , who went through the program six years ago			2
@entity192 , who 's also a painter , has been commissioned to do his first solo mural -- at @entity199 in @entity18			0
he spoke of his turbulent past without any hesitation			0
" i had to go through two suicide attempts and rehab before i rediscovered my higher power , my @entity178 , to believe that i do belong in this world , " @entity192 said to @entity0			0
@entity192 says it 's hopelessness and a broken spirit that leads a person to join a gang			2
" when you 're poor and have nothing , and see how gang life is full of girls , money -- and you 're surrounded by others who you can relate to , with their fathers and mothers in jail or on drugs , the gang life can be tempting			0
" there are times when @entity4 runs into former " homies , " and while they exchange pleasantries , he does everything he can to avoid contact because he 's worried it might set him back			0
so , now he lives far away from his old neighborhood with his older sister			0
" it feels good coming back from a long day at work and just staying home , " @entity4 said , " and , when i 'm not at the bakery , i 'm playing with my son , memorizing recipes , studying for my @entity133 , reading , and i even go to my sister 's church on sundays			0
