-- @entity2 defense secretary @entity1 says his @entity4 counterpart assured him that an important security pact will be reached with @entity6 in a " timely manner , " despite a failure so far to forge a deal			1
@entity10 made the remark during a visit to @entity4 on saturday			1
what is known as the bilateral security agreement -- ready to be implemented but still unsigned -- initially has been front and center in @entity10 's visit			0
@entity10 met with @entity4 's officials , including the country 's defense minister , as @entity21 works to get @entity4 to ink a bilateral security agreement to keep some @entity2 and other coalition troops in the country after next year			1
the defense secretary said that from what he has heard in his discussions with @entity4 ministers , they believe it 's in the country 's interest to have such an agreement -- which lays out the @entity2 military presence in @entity4 after 2014 , when the @entity36 - led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave			1
" the minister of defense assured me that the @entity41 would be signed and would be signed in a very timely manner , " @entity10 said , making reference to defense minister @entity39			2
but failure to forge a security pact with @entity4 president @entity45 has generated growing consternation among @entity2 officials			2
the security agreement itself has been endorsed by the @entity4 council of tribal leaders , called the loya jirga , but @entity45 said he wo n't sign it until after the country 's elections in april and until certain conditions are met			2
these conditions include an end to @entity2 raids on @entity4 homes and the release of @entity4 prisoners from the @entity63 detention center			0
@entity21 has resisted such changes , saying @entity45 's demands are new provisions added to a deal that was already reached			0
@entity10 said he had n't planned to meet with @entity45 and played down the significance of being in @entity4 and not meeting with the president			1
he said the trip had been planned for weeks and its purpose was visiting troops and meeting with @entity4 commanders to assess their progress			1
and , he told reporters , there have been many discussions at the political level with @entity45 during recent visits by other others , such as secretary of state @entity82			0
@entity10 emphasized the importance of the loya jirga 's decision and said " we are planning for a post- 2014 presence here			0
" but he said @entity36 -- which commands the multination @entity89 in @entity4 -- will eventually need clarity on the security agreement 's status so it can properly plan its work in the country			0
@entity36 warned it may be forced to withdraw all of its troops from @entity4 by the end of next year if @entity45 does n't sign a security agreement with the @entity2			1
@entity45 , meanwhile , is scheduled to make a visit to @entity99 on sunday			1
@entity99 's semi-official @entity100 said @entity45 will be meeting with @entity99 president @entity101			2
according to state - run @entity104 , an @entity99 @entity103 spokeswoman said @entity105 does n't believe the security agreement will benefit the @entity4 government and nation			2
@entity109 said @entity105 's position is that the security pact is not " useful for the long - term expedience and interests of @entity4			0
" and could have a negative impact on regional issues			0
@entity0 's @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118 contributed to this report			0
