@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's the end of the day in rural southwest @entity1 , and the @entity5 family wanders through a ditch along a county road , their eyes fixed on the earth			1
@entity11 and @entity5 , and their three kids , are on a mission for fragments of rock that came from about as far away as one can imagine			1
" we 're not finding a lot , but that 's beside the point really , " @entity5 says			0
" we 're not professionals			0
it 's purely for fun			0
" it all began the evening of april 14 , when what looked like a giant fireball came crashing through the atmosphere			1
" it just lit up the whole sky , " she says			0
" you thought it was thunder and lightning , but it just kept going and going and going			0
" " it really did n't sound natural , " @entity36 adds			0
what they were witnessing was a meteor -- and a pretty spectacular one at that			1
watch the video @entity43 , whom the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , calls the " world 's top meteorite hunter , " said that as soon as he saw video of the display , he hopped a flight to @entity1			1
" most of them do n't make a light show or a sound show , " @entity52 said			0
" when this one came in , the energy released was like nuclear bomb - type energy			1
... [ i knew ] there would be thousands of pieces on the ground			0
" by definition , those pieces are what scientists call meteorites : the remnants of the meteor that do n't burn up along the journey and instead make it all the way to the ground			1
@entity52 headed to the sleepy @entity1 village of @entity0 , which was about to become ground zero for the latest meteorite hunt			1
@entity0 , with a population of 597 , was the town nearest to where the otherworldly bits were turning up			1
soon , everyone wanted a piece of the action -- from internationally known experts to the locals , like 7 - year - old @entity87			2
@entity87 , along with dozens of other students at @entity89 in @entity0 , learned about the meteors from geologists and meteorite - hunting experts at a school assembly			1
later that day , the kids combed the school grounds for meteorites during recess			2
@entity87 found a rock that one of the experts confirmed was a meteorite , weighing 35 grams			1
he sold it to a collector , but they would n't say for how much			2
on average , prices for pieces of this particular space rock have been set at about $ 10 to $ 20 per gram , according to @entity52			1
he added that a meteorite 's worth can vary , depending on the amount of buzz surrounding an event and how much media attention has been devoted to it			1
it 's easy to compare it all to a mini gold rush			0
most folks are n't hunting with the mere hopes of winning bragging rights			0
@entity119 , who lives on a farm near @entity0 , said his wife found a meteorite weighing about 100 grams			1
" i 'm told it 's worth maybe a thousand dollars , " @entity119 said			0
so far , about two dozen pieces had been found , one expert hunter said			2
but there 's no way of knowing for sure , since many do n't announce it when they do find one			0
but what do the residents think about the influx of people to their small town ? they 've welcomed them with open arms -- primarily because it 's a boost to the economy			1
who needs a government stimulus when you 've got money falling from the sky ? " we 've gotten business we never would have had , " said @entity145 , village president			2
" i mean , who was going to come to @entity0 ? it 's off the map			1
" @entity151 , owner of @entity152 , a local gas station and convenience store , says business is up by about 30 percent since folks started finding meteorites			0
" it 's what we needed , a little boost , " @entity151 said			0
" it 's been great for the town , great for the whole area			2
" his store has become a pseudo-trading post , where people looking for or wanting to sell meteorites have put their contact information on signs along the counter			2
if and when the @entity5 family gets their hands on a meteorite , they say it wo n't be from a want ad			2
they 'll do it all on their own			0
as 11 - year - old @entity184 put it , " it 's a sense of pride to find one			0

@entity0 , @entity1 , is the town nearest to the april 14 meteor strike

the meteor fragments can sell for between $ 10 and $ 20 a gram
