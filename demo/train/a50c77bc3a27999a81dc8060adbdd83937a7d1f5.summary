the critical moment for sen. @entity1 and his allies came around 7 p.m. on tuesday night			1
the @entity5 @entity4 's suit was still crisp , despite more than four hours into what would become a rhetorical marathon of more than 21 hours on the @entity9 floor aimed at derailing @entity10			1
but until that point , the brunt of the speaking had been done by @entity1 and his ally , sen. @entity14 , @entity15			1
without more help , @entity14 's aides were n't sure how long the effort could continue			1
then sen. @entity19 , @entity20 , arrived			2
it was a sign that they 'd get the bodies they needed for the long haul			2
" when he showed up , we had a feeling that we could go until noon ( the next day ) , " said @entity14 spokesman @entity26			2
@entity14 was on or near the floor all night			0
sen. @entity31 of @entity32 , who held the floor for 12 hours in march , jumped in			0
even ideological opponent sen. @entity34 , @entity35 , shouldered some speaking time while trying to refute @entity1 ' points			1
that gave @entity1 some time for mental breaks even though he could n't leave the floor to eat , use the restroom or do anything else			1
for material , staff pulled together binders of articles , talking points and documents that could be used to fill time			2
and as social networks heated up , aides ferried in a stream of tweets for @entity1 to read			2
but to the big and less comfortable question : how did he manage physically ? good , pliable shoes , for a start			0
@entity1 left his trademark @entity58 boots behind and told the chamber that he picked up some sneakers in preparation for the long hours of standing			1
@entity9 rules ban anyone from eating on the chamber floor			1
@entity70 senior congressional producer @entity69 asked @entity1 how he stood for more than 21 hours without having to use the men 's room			1
" drinking very little water , " he replied			0
that surely is part of it			0
but we do not know if anything else was involved , as has been the case in the past			0
the @entity9 's marathon speech record - holder , the @entity81 of @entity82 , reportedly set up a bucket in the @entity9 cloakroom next to the chamber and used it while keeping one foot on the @entity9 floor , so as to retain his speaking position			1
former sen. @entity88 of @entity89 used some kind of bag during his portion of a filibuster , according to an oral history from former parliamentarian @entity95			0
it did not end well			0
" that 's always a defining issue , how much stamina a person has , " said @entity9 historian @entity97 , who recorded the oral history with @entity95 and says there is a tradition of senators using a contraption for bodily functions during speech - a - thons			1
@entity1 was on the @entity9 floor just 1 hour and 41 minutes short of a day			1
" i do n't know of any special thing he used , " said @entity26			0
" and he did n't indicate there was anything			0
" that 's one of those things that is so personal that there are only a couple of people who know			0
and they will probably take it to their graves			0
" @entity1 ' office did not respond to @entity70 's request for more details .			2
