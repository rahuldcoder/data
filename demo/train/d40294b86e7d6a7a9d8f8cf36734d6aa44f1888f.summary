@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 will be allowed to work for themselves in 178 activities in the private sector and even hire employees , according to guidelines published friday as the communist government moves quickly to shed half a million state jobs and provide alternatives for workers			1
@entity1 will be permitted to be self - employed carpenters , restaurateurs , barbers and even salsa dancers			1
many of the categories already existed , but the government had n't granted new licenses for years , which meant that the total number of self - employed people in @entity1 's 5.1 million - strong workforce was just 143,000			2
the new list of occupations published in state media includes seven new categories , among them accountants and bathroom attendants			1
it also says that for the first time in decades , these private entrepreneurs will be allowed to hire nonrelatives and access credit			0
the measures are aimed at " raising levels of productivity and efficiency , " according to state - run newspaper @entity38 , and eliminating the social " stigma " long associated with self - employment in the socialist system			2
last week , @entity1 announced it would eliminate " at least " 500,000 state jobs , or 10 percent of the public sector workforce , over the next six months and pave the way for more private enterprise			1
this is the most dramatic move yet by president @entity47 to reshape the country 's sputtering economy , but he insists the socialist system will not be altered			0
the announcement got mixed reactions from @entity1			2
some are concerned that a way of life ­ and a guaranteed fixed income ­ are disappearing			0
others are optimistic that they will be able to make more money in the private sector			0
the average state salary is just $ 20 a month			0
but many details , like how much these entrepreneurs will have to pay in taxes , social security and licensing fees , are still missing			0
