-- people arrested amid unrest in @entity3 are being subjected to systematic torture , including electric shocks , beatings and sexual violence , a report by rights group @entity9 said wednesday			1
based on interviews in @entity11 with dozens of @entity3 who have fled the country , the report details " 31 methods of torture or other ill treatment " at the hands of the security forces , army and pro-government armed gangs			1
this thursday marks a year since unrest first broke out , prompting a bloody crackdown and massive wave of arrests by the @entity3 authorities			1
the government says it is battling " armed terrorist groups " but international leaders and rights groups dispute that			0
the torture meted out to those arrested on suspicion of opposing the government has generally followed a set pattern , says the @entity9 report , titled " ' i wanted to die ' : @entity3 's torture survivors speak out			1
" many detainees say they were beaten on arrest , and then subjected to severe beatings on arrival at detention centers			1
but their accounts show the greatest risk of abuse came when they were interrogated , the report says			0
several detainees describe being forced into a vehicle tire and then beaten with cables or sticks , the report says			2
others tell of being suspended above the ground by their wrists and then beaten , and of being forced to strip naked , often for long periods in extreme cold			0
an 18 - year - old victim named as " @entity55 " told researchers that his interrogators used pincers to gouge flesh from his legs while he was held for 25 days in @entity61 in december			0
another man , a 29 - year - old arabic language teacher identified as " @entity64 , " also described horrific treatment while being held in @entity61			2
" we were hung from wood -- crucified -- while blindfolded and handcuffed , and then beaten mercilessly and repeatedly between 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. , " he told the @entity9 researchers			2
detainees also were forced to witness abuse and hear others -- sometimes relatives or friends -- being tortured and raped , the report says			0
" i heard the screams of those being tortured for 24 hours a day			0
while in the cell we were busy praying for the safety of those who are being tortured , " @entity64 is quoted as saying			0
the accounts reveal " a nightmarish world of systematic torture , " said @entity83 , interim deputy director for @entity9 's @entity84 and @entity86 program			1
" the testimonies we have heard give disturbing insights into a system of detention and interrogation which , a year after protests began , appears intended primarily to degrade , humiliate and terrify its victims into silence , " she said			1
she said the experience for detainees arrested over the past year is similar to that endured under former president @entity98 , father of the current leader , @entity99			2
researchers spoke with dozens of @entity3 in @entity11 , including 25 who said they were tortured or ill - treated in detention before fleeing the country , an @entity9 press statement says			1
more than half the 19 cases featured in the report are from @entity61 province , it adds			0
the abuses are being routinely carried out despite @entity3 being a party to the convention against torture and other international agreements , the report says , and the @entity3 authorities " appear to have no desire to try to stamp out these grave human rights violations			1
" the rights group urges @entity3 to take " urgent measures " to prevent further crimes under international law , including ending the arbitrary arrest and detention of those protesting peacefully against the government and halting the systemic use of torture			1
it also calls on the international community to take on responsibility for protecting the human rights of the @entity3 people and ensuring violations are investigated and prosecuted			2
international leaders should also assist humanitarian agencies , rights groups and non-governmental organizations in helping the survivors of torture and their families , particularly in cases of sexual violence			1
lastly , the report urges the @entity142 to act by referring the situation to the @entity144 for investigation , imposing a comprehensive arms embargo and freezing the assets of @entity99 and his associates			0
@entity149 and @entity150 vetoed a @entity142 resolution last month that many other countries argued could have helped stop the violence			0
the resolution would have condemned @entity99 and called on him to step aside			0
more than 8,000 people have been killed in the @entity3 conflict , including many women and children , @entity158 , current president of the @entity159 , said tuesday			2
opposition activists have put the toll at more than 9,000			0
about 30,000 @entity3 have fled to neighboring countries in the past year , according to @entity163 , the @entity159 high commissioner for refugees ' coordinator for @entity3 refugees			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in @entity3 because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists			2
but most reports from inside @entity3 indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking @entity99 's ouster			1
the @entity177 has ruled @entity3 for more than four decades			0
members of the @entity3 security forces are also among those killed as the initially peaceful protests have spiraled into widespread violence			1
@entity0 's @entity183 contributed to this report .			0
