@entity0 -- the @entity3 on thursday morning will receive a classified document that seeks to justify the administration 's policy of targeting @entity7 overseas via drone attacks , chairwoman @entity2 said late wednesday			1
" i am pleased that the president has agreed to provide the @entity3 with access to the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) opinion regarding the use of lethal force in counterterrorism operations , " the @entity10 @entity9 said in a statement			1
" it is critical for the committee 's oversight function to fully understand the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations			1
" the announcement came shortly after an administration official said that president @entity27 had yielded to demands that he turn over to @entity29 the classified @entity31 legal advice that seeks to justify the policy			1
the developments came the night before confirmation hearings are to be held for @entity27 's @entity36 director nominee , @entity35 , and amid complaints from senators , including several @entity39 , about secrecy surrounding the drone policy			1
" today , as part of the president 's ongoing commitment to consult with @entity29 on national security matters , the president directed the @entity31 to provide the congressional intelligence committees access to classified @entity14 advice related to the subject of the @entity31 @entity50 , " an administration official said			1
the 16 - page white paper -- titled " @entity52 who is a senior operational leader of @entity54 or an @entity55 " -- is a policy paper rather than an official legal document			1
memo backs @entity7 using lethal force against @entity7 overseas the president , the official said , was turning over the information because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy			2
opinion : bring drones out of the shadows in a 2012 speech at the @entity69 in @entity0 , @entity35 asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the @entity72 resolution passed by @entity29 after the september 11 attacks and because , " there is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield , at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat			1
" this does not appear to be the view of @entity89 , @entity91 special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights , who announced plans in october to investigate @entity7 drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties			2
the drone campaign against @entity54 and its allies has been one of @entity35 's biggest legacies in the four years he was the president 's principal adviser on terrorism			1
according to a count by the public policy group @entity106 , at least 28 of @entity54 's leading members have been killed in drone strikes , including the @entity7 citizen @entity108 , who played an operational role in @entity110			2
human rights groups in the @entity7 are particularly aggrieved by the targeted killing of @entity108 , who was killed by a drone			2
his teenage son died in a separate strike			2
on wednesday , the chairman of the @entity117 said the attack that killed @entity108 was justified			2
" this is somebody who had said that he did n't want his @entity7 citizenship anymore , rep. @entity119 , @entity120 , told @entity123 's " @entity124			0
" " he had officially joined @entity54 , " @entity119 said			0
" @entity54 had declared war on the @entity7			0
" @entity119 continued , " the legal basis of this goes back many , many years when @entity7 citizens would go and fight for foreign nations that were engaging in combat with the @entity7			0
so what they were saying is , once you 've made that choice , you no longer get the protections that you would			0
i mean , if you join the enemy overseas , you join the enemy overseas			0
and we 're going to fight the enemy overseas			0
" in his speech at the @entity69 , @entity35 said that drone strikes are " ethical " because of " the unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely target a military objective while minimizing collateral damage ; one could argue that never before has there been a weapon that allows us to distinguish more effectively between an @entity54 terrorist and innocent civilians			1
" and @entity27 himself defended it in an appearance last october on " @entity155			0
" " there are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world , and you 've got to make a call and it 's not optimal , " he said			0
" and sometimes you 've got to make some tough calls			0
but you can do so in a way that 's consistent with international law and with @entity7 law			0
