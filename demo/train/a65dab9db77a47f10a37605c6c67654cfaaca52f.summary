@entity3 has n't been seen since , and while authorities long ago opened a homicide investigation , her body has n't been found			1

" trash from the location is taken to a transfer station and ultimately to @entity87 , police said			0
some 280 law enforcement officers from 13 agencies went through 9,500 tons of trash , but ended their search weeks ago without finding any sign of @entity3 , @entity12 said thursday			2
the police chief added that there are no plans to look further for the girl			0

" after that search was finished , police and the @entity103 's office worked together in preparing a case , which they then presented to a grand jury			0
@entity22 , the county attorney , said the fact authorities have n't found @entity3 's body did n't prove to be an impediment in securing an indictment nor did he expect it would prevent a jury from convicting @entity24			1
@entity12 , police chief for the city of about 225,000 just northwest of @entity113 , acknowledged the toll @entity3 's disappearance has taken on residents , grief and frustration that now may be tempered with @entity24 's arrest			2
