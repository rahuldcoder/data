-- the gun outrages continue , the latest the shooting of a gun instructor in @entity4 by a 9 - year - old girl who was taken to the range by her parents so she could shoot an @entity8 , an @entity9 - made submachine gun			1
the question that the whole world asks is this : why was a 9 - year - old girl allowed even to try to shoot a submachine gun ? i have a further question : why does anybody not on the front lines of the military in a war zone need to have access to a submachine gun ? it 's not as though we have n't had plenty of evidence that this gun thing in @entity27 is n't working			1
since the ghastly massacre of elementary school children at @entity31 on december 14 , 2012 , by a deranged teenager , as of june there were at least 74 school shootings , on school grounds or in schools themselves			1
it 's commonplace in this country now : a deranged shooter appears , armed to the teeth , out of his mind			1
everyone ducks or runs for cover			0
the shooter proceeds calmly through the building , taking out innocents			0
what kind of country have we become ? was this what the @entity50 had in mind ? the @entity53 will scream : the second amendment ! the second amendment ! please be aware that most of what you think you know about the history of this amendment is nonsense			1
many good books and articles exist on the subject , all neatly summarized by @entity64 a couple of years ago			0
he wrote : " if the nation truly embraced the @entity55 as it was originally written , it would be the @entity53 's worst nightmare			2
" look at this amendment again : " a well - regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed			1
" @entity76 and the others who framed this single sentence understood perfectly well that you ca n't have unregulated mobs running around in the streets with guns			2
that 's why " a well - regulated militia " goes first in this single sentence			1
regulation is the key concept here , which is why the framers foregrounded this clause			0
so who were these militias in need of regulation ? in the @entity93 , they were called " slave patrols , " and they were paramilitary groups that regularly patrolled slave plantations to make sure restive slaves were n't going to rise up against their white @entity98 the line in the movie " @entity100 " ? @entity102 wonders : " why do n't they just rise up and kill the whites ? " it was a real question , and the answer was that " well - regulated militias " in the @entity93 kept the slaves in check			1
@entity109 , @entity110 and @entity76 knew , as they considered the @entity55 , that it would be essential if they hoped to get the @entity93 states to ratify the brand - new @entity27 @entity115			1
it was designed to keep these states on board			0
there were hundreds of slave uprisings in the @entity93 before the @entity115 was ratified			1
for a full history of this , get your hands on @entity125 's book , " @entity126 : law and violence in @entity129 and the @entity130			2
" as @entity134 demonstrates , most men in the slave states between age 18 and 45 would have had to serve on one of these well - regulated militias at some point			1
the @entity93 were police states designed to keep slaves in check			1
their economy had been built around slavery			0
it is clear in the recorded speeches of @entity109 and @entity110 , two of the @entity50 , that the @entity55 was specifically handed as a bone to the @entity93 , manufactured to keep them happy			1
@entity76 , a slave - holder himself , had no doubt about the need to keep these slave militias going in the @entity93			1
he wrote about this often and without ambiguity			0
@entity154 discussed these ideas in a recent article			0
the @entity53 has tried to blur the historical truth about the @entity55			0
in fact , at its headquarters in @entity162 , the words of the amendment are emblazoned right in front of the entrance			1
oops ! they have emblazoned exactly half of this brief amendment , leaving off the embarrassing front part , about a " well - regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free @entity172			1
" ( @entity173 also , the amendment says @entity172 , not @entity174 -- and these framers knew the difference , as it 's a major difference noted elsewhere in the @entity178			1
) the idea that owning a gun in @entity27 was an individual right only dates to the 1980s			1
a bunch of right - wing think tanks got to work creating this individual right			2
in 1991 , chief justice @entity185 called this new wrinkle in the @entity55 " one of the greatest pieces of fraud -- i repeat the word ' fraud ' -- on the @entity27 public by special interest groups that i have ever seen in my lifetime			0
there just is no right for the individual to bear arms in the @entity178			2
you have to belong to a well - regulated militia , such as the @entity202 , if you want to bear arms			2
of course , the @entity204 did an end run in recent years around what the framers of the @entity178 actually intended			1
( so much for our famous " originalists , " such as justice @entity210 , who really does whatever he wants and comes up with a bogus argument to say he 's going back to what the framers actually meant			2
) the 2008 case known as @entity215 is a botched piece of argumentation , as even conservative judge @entity218 has written , tearing @entity210 's opinion to shreds as an incoherent piece of tripe			2
let 's say , however , that hunters should have the right to possess and use hunting rifles			2
why not , if they keep them unloaded except for when hunting ? it should be just fine to belong to a gun club and shoot skeet or whatever			0
but nobody needs an assault weapon who is not fighting in the @entity235 , or perhaps going after drug lords in @entity237			0
why , then , do @entity27 love their guns ? i will make a bold suggestion			0
in a country where @entity27 sense , quite genuinely , that their freedoms have been taken away by the government -- as in the @entity244 , as in @entity246 surveillance -- people feel powerless			0
it makes you feel more powerful if you can enhance your personal strength with a gun			0
there is the romance of the @entity254 , too , which reinforces this idea			0
it 's " @entity257 " all the time in @entity27			0
but this is dangerous and false thinking , and it leads to chaos			0
@entity262 is what we now face on the streets in this country every single day			0
it 's time for us to revisit the @entity55 and get every assault weapon off the streets , for good .			0

@entity271 : only someone on war 's front lines should have access to a submachine gun
@entity271 : at least 74 school shootings since @entity31 : is our romance with guns working ?
he says amendment gave gun rights to " well regulated militias " to appease @entity93 's slave patrols
@entity271 : gun ownership as an individual right only dates to 1980s @entity204 ruling
