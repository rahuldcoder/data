-- with car companies going in into bankruptcy and shedding famous names left and right , it 's important to remember that today 's automotive titans started out as tiny startups , not unlike @entity8 entrepreneurs			1
@entity9 was almost called @entity10 names like @entity12 , @entity9 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today			1
but behind every brand name , there is a flesh - and - blood inventor , entrepreneur or industrialist			2
most of the time , they gave their name to the companies			2
and that fame was often about all they ended up with			2
@entity30 , who invented the overhead valve engine , founded the @entity32 in 1903			1
@entity33 , the industrialist who would eventually found @entity9 , took over the company in 1904 , when it ran into financial trouble			2
@entity36 stayed on as a director , but left in 1908 , never making much money from the enterprise			2
he reportedly died in 1929 , unable to afford one of his cars			2
@entity33 kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car , even though he worried that people might pronounce it " @entity48 , " according to one author			1
strangely enough , the man who practically created @entity9 single - handedly never really liked the idea of a ' @entity33 ' car			1
in another example , @entity53 invented the @entity55 , ' a two - seat runabout , in 1908			1
but he sold his stock in his @entity55 in 1911			2
he turned around and founded the @entity55 that same year			1
investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the " @entity55 " from his new company 's name and they won			1
his own automotive glory quickly faded , although the @entity55 survived until the 1940s			2
@entity67 - born @entity66 's experience was similar			1
@entity33 brought him into a new car - building venture in 1911 , hoping to trade on his fame as an absolutely fearless race car driver			1
@entity71 left the company in 1913 , apparently unable to make the adjustment from racing to building production vehicles			2
but its name stuck to the new @entity71 vehicles ; @entity33 reportedly liked its musical lilt			1
it could also work the other way around			2
in 1925 , @entity80 got the naming rights to the @entity82 after he and another industrialist steadily bought up shares in the firm over a two - year period			2
things turned out a little differently for @entity88			2
he suffered the ignominy of being booted from an early auto company that bore his own name			0
but his revenge was sweet			0
the @entity93 , which traded freely on @entity12 's early fame as an inventor , fired him in 1902 " because he was spending all his time developing a race car , not a passenger car , " according to the @entity96			1
@entity101 autos : @entity12 's ' @entity103 ' engineers most important new car after @entity12 was gone , the company was renamed @entity106 , after @entity107 , the @entity108 nobleman who founded @entity109 in 1703 ; his heraldry became the model 's badge and the company became a part of @entity9 in 1909			1
after his firing , @entity12 quickly found investors to help him found his own firm , the @entity12 , in 1903			1
he introduced the company 's first new vehicle , the model and followed it up with other low - cost vehicles , including his greatest achievement , the @entity122 , in 1908			1
its price tag started at $ 850 and fell steadily as @entity12 introduced more production innovations			1
the young firm became phenomenally successful			0
@entity101 autos : 10 classic @entity129 rides in the 1920s , he got the chance to buy the five - year - old @entity133 out of bankruptcy			0
it was then owned by one of the very people , @entity136 , who fired him in 1902			1
then he used the former aircraft company to launch his own line of luxury cars bearing the @entity133 name			0
for its part , @entity9 almost did n't get the name it bears today			0
@entity33 actually incorporated his company under the name " @entity10 " , in @entity147 in 1908			0
but his attorney advised him that it would be easier to raise capital under a new name			0
" we might use ' @entity154 ' were it not for the fact that there is already a @entity157 in that state , " the attorney wrote			0
" we suggest the name @entity9 , as we have ascertained it can be used			0
" a newly coined @entity108 word , auto - mobile , inspired many vehicle names of the early years			0
@entity163 filed a patent for an " auto - mobile " during the mid- 1890s			0
names like @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity55 , and of course , the @entity170 , could not have come along without it			0
the origins of some names can be tricky to trace			0
the first use of @entity175 , for instance			0
@entity178 , the author of a book called " jeep , " concludes that it 's based on early @entity183 slang for " a new , unproven recruit or a new unproven vehicle			1
" it was n't until 1950 that @entity188 - based @entity187 , one of the producers of the early four - wheel - drive vehicle , trademarked the term			0
many of the names were not originally associated with the auto industry			0
the @entity14 name came from the @entity198 loom works in @entity199 , @entity200 ; when it turned to car production , the @entity198 family changed the 'd ' to a ' t ' to make it simpler and more elegant in @entity200 script			1
@entity101 autos : top 10 best car names there 's little doubt about other brand names			1
@entity212 was an offshoot of the @entity214 , a horseless carriage manufacturer named after a renowned @entity217 chief			0
mechanic @entity218 started producing motorized bicycles after the devastation of @entity183 and eventually graduated to cars			1
@entity101 autos : pontiacs we 'll never forget @entity225 , a response to @entity228 's call for a car for the common folk , means ' people 's car ' in @entity233 , evidently beating out the prototype 's name , ' @entity236 , ' for the honors			1
in 1917 , the @entity238 became known as the @entity239 , or @entity239 ( @entity239 ) as the four - year - old airplane engine firm diversified into motorcycle engines , with a stylized white propeller against a blue sky as its logo , according to some authorities			1
the first @entity239 cars were produced 11 years later			0
the legendary @entity248 name is considered one of the best sports car names of all time			2
it beat out a long list of lackluster animal names compiled by a @entity255 ad agency in 1935			0
in 1939 , @entity88 struck gold with @entity257 , the fleet - footed messenger of the gods			0
it tapped into @entity262 and @entity263 mythology for the name , just as it did for the similarly styled @entity265 , the god of the wind , three years earlier			0
some other storied automotive brands are based on acronyms			0
@entity270 stands for @entity271 , or @entity272			0
similarly , @entity273 stands for @entity274 , or @entity275 , hearkening back to the automaker 's origins as an aircraft company			2
@entity12 might have done better with an acronym in 1958			1
the @entity280 was conceived as a new , distinct @entity12 brand , with its own models , badge and division			1
the mission was to take on @entity9 's @entity170			2
after considering thousands of suggestions , @entity12 named the new brand after @entity288 , @entity88 's only child			1
he had been a major styling influence within the company and was its president at his fathers death in 1943			0
the name @entity280 was an immediate letdown			0
@entity12 stock fell 10 points on the day it was announced			1
one disenchanted executive predicted that the name alone would cost the new vehicle 200,000 units in sales			0
@entity101 autos : best and worst automotive designs of all time its name was n't the sole reason for its failure			0
it did n't help that the country was in recession or that the new car seemed based on @entity12 and @entity257 models			1
but all that did n't stop @entity280 from entering the vocabulary as an idea or project fated to failure .			0
