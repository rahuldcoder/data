-- as we mark the 25th observance of @entity3 on december 1 , we have a golden opportunity to begin to end the hiv / aids pandemic			1
to start with , this has been an extraordinary year for hiv / aids research , with headline - grabbing breakthroughs that stand as undeniable evidence of progress toward a cure			1
the first documented case of a child cured of @entity14 , reported in march , was followed in july by a report of two adult @entity14 patients no longer showing any signs of virus after undergoing stem - cell transplants and stopping antiretroviral treatment			0
much work lies ahead before these and other scientific advances can be parlayed into a broadly applicable cure that can be made available to the 35 million people living with hiv / aids worldwide			1
but it is an irony bordering on tragedy that just as a cure for @entity26 is beginning to seem like a realistic proposition , the belt - tightening measures of the age of austerity could halt our momentum , cripple our progress and dash our hopes for ending @entity26 in our lifetime			1
as a result of @entity43 budget sequestration , the @entity44 -- the engine of progress on aids research for 30 years -- will lose $ 229 million in aids research funding in the coming year			1
this caps a dismal decade for @entity26 and other biomedical research support : from 2003 to 2012 , the @entity44 lost 22 of its purchasing power as a result of stagnant levels of funding			1
this hammer blow to aids research funding will be accompanied by cuts to a range of other hiv / aids programs -- cuts that will have negligible effect on the federal deficit but will have real consequences for people living with @entity26 in the @entity43 and around the world			1
@entity65 : get loud about fighting @entity14 based on the latest available data , @entity68 , @entity66 , has estimated that reduced funding for the president 's @entity70 ( @entity70 ) alone could result in 228,000 fewer people receiving treatment for @entity14			2
this could lead to as many as 52,000 aids - related deaths and could leave more than 100,000 children orphaned			2
the @entity77 has said that @entity70 has been " globally transformative " and has " had major positive effects on the health and well - being of individual beneficiaries , on institutions and systems in partner countries , and the overall global response to @entity26			1
" interactive : @entity3 and what it means why , then , are we shortchanging a program that enjoys broad bipartisan and popular support , has done more than any other foreign policy initiative in recent years to burnish @entity43 's image abroad , and has already altered -- though not irreversibly -- the trajectory of the hiv / aids pandemic ? nor will people living with @entity14 here in the @entity43 be spared			1
@entity68 also estimates that the sequester could cause about 15,000 @entity43 who need help paying for their medications to lose support from the @entity100			0
and more than 4,000 households could lose housing assistance as a result of cuts in the federally funded @entity105 for @entity106			0
all of these cuts will fall disproportionately on people of color			0
just a few years ago , the notion of a cure for @entity14 was considered by many to be heretical			0
it was creating false hope			0
it was n't technically feasible			0
it could n't be done			0
that all changed with the first reports , in 2008 , of @entity118 , the " @entity119 patient			0
" while on treatment for @entity14 , @entity118 was diagnosed with leukemia			0
to treat the leukemia , he received a stem - cell transplant -- with a twist			0
his savvy @entity126 doctor deliberately sought , and found , a stem - cell donor from among a very small group of people born with a genetic mutation that renders them highly resistant to hiv infection			2
after the transplant , @entity118 was able to stop @entity14 treatment without experiencing a return of the disease			2
zero new hiv infections among children can be a reality similarly , the idea of an " @entity26 - free generation " today is tossed around with abandon			1
it was n't always thus			0
but over 30 years , we have developed a raft of tools that enable us to effectively prevent and treat hiv infection			2
what 's more , research has shown us conclusively that treatment is prevention			1
putting people on antiretroviral drugs makes them less infectious and less likely to transmit the virus to others			0
combine a broader deployment of these tools with an expansion of programs such as @entity70 and a sustained investment in research , and you have a trifecta : a winning combination that could achieve the conquest of the @entity163 in the foreseeable future			2
@entity165 on @entity26 , and you 'll pretty much guarantee that we 'll be dealing with it for generations to come			1
@entity169 : where to put the smart money to end @entity26 the opinions expressed are solely those of @entity173 and @entity174 .			2

it 's been a year of breakthroughs in hiv / aids research
but sequestration and *cutbacks* will *affect* those living with the disease
*backpedaling* on @entity26 may mean we *continue* grappling with it for generations
