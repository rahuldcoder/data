@entity0 -- an outside company now heads the effort to correct problems with @entity5 , rather than the federal agency getting most of the blame for the botched rollout of the website to enroll in president @entity11 's signature health care reforms			1
@entity12 , the former @entity13 budget officer assigned by @entity11 to fix the mess , said friday that @entity15 , a @entity16 tech company , would serve as the " general contractor " in working to make the website function smoothly by the end of november			1
the announcement was a shift in tone and strategy for the administration			0
the federal @entity25 ( @entity25 ) was the lead agency in overseeing creation of the online site that buckled under the volume of initial visitors following its october 1 launch			0
@entity15 was one of the dozens of contractors working with the government on the project coordinated by @entity25 , and now has the role of managing the correction efforts , according to @entity12			1
" there is now a general contractor who is overseeing the other contractors and directing the effort			2
in the tech world , this would be called a new systems integrator , " the @entity13 said in a statement			0
" this general contractor will work around the clock with all the key decision makers and players , including @entity25 leadership and staff , vendors and contractors			2
" the problems became a political liability for the @entity11 administration by emboldening @entity57 efforts to undermine the health care reforms detested by conservatives as an extreme example of government overreach			1
after weeks of pledges by @entity11 and other officials to correct problems , including the inability to register , lengthy delays and incorrect information being relayed to insurers , @entity12 offered the first solid target for significant improvement			1
he said @entity5 would work fully for the " vast majority " of users in just over a month			0
" @entity5 is fixable , " he said on a conference call			0
@entity12 confirmed that as many as 70 % of its users were unable to complete the first step of the enrollment process -- creating accounts -- at various times in recent weeks			1
the situation has improved , he said , while acknowledging other difficulties comprised a " punch list " of items being addressed			0
" the punch list is dozens of items on both sides , in terms of priorities both on performance and functionality , " @entity12 said , adding that new problems would be added as discovered " but most importantly , we will be taking issues off the list			2
" contractors point fingers in more than four hours of testimony before the @entity99 on thursday , officials of contractors hired to create @entity5 cited a lack of testing on the full system and last - minute changes by the federal agency overseeing the online enrollment effort			2
@entity57 rep. @entity105 of @entity106 said that " the bottom line here is that @entity25 is responsible for this failure , " while other @entity57 also targeted @entity111 secretary @entity110 , whose department includes @entity25			2
angry exchanges between @entity57 who oppose the @entity115 and @entity116 defending it erupted repeatedly at the hearing , while the contractors insisted their work went fine even though the software functioned poorly when the system went live			1
" i think the problems with @entity127 are much deeper than a website , " @entity57 rep. @entity120 of @entity121 told @entity1 on thursday , echoing the @entity57 attack line that the health care reforms intended to help millions of uninsured @entity124 get affordable coverage are unmanageable			1
@entity13 spokesman @entity129 told reporters that plenty of time remained to get the website fixed and people enrolled before the sign - up deadline of march 31			2
he said @entity12 had figured out the problems that needed to be addressed and now put in place the management changes to do so			2
while visiting a health insurance call center friday in @entity140 , @entity110 stuck to the @entity11 administration 's line that the website for enrolling in new health insurance exchanges was improving			1
@entity110 admitted she was surprised by the site 's failure upon rollout			0
" i did n't realize it would n't be operating optimally before the launch , " she said			0
" i think we knew that if we had had another six months , we would probably test further , but i do n't think that anyone fully realized that both volume caused some problems , but volume also exposed some problems , " she said			0
request to extend the deadline separately , 10 @entity116 senators have asked @entity110 to extend the open enrollment period for insurance exchanges beyond march 31			1
if the period is not extended , people who are uninsured after that date would face an @entity163 fine under the health care reforms			1
but @entity110 described the open enrollment period as " unusually long " already and said any extension would have some consequences			1
responding to @entity167 @entity110 and her agency came under new pressure from the chairman of the @entity57 - led @entity171 , who said he might consider a subpoena to get information he wants on contracts , communications and other details involving the @entity127 website			1
committee aides said thursday that the @entity181 had so far failed to respond to a previous request , and rep. @entity183 of @entity184 gave @entity110 until monday to comply or possibly face " compulsory " action			0
the agency said it is working to comply			0
" the committee sent us an extremely broad request for documents on october 10 - while the government was still shut down - and asked that we produce these materials within two weeks , " @entity111 spokeswoman @entity187 said in a statement			0
@entity187 said the agency has " been engaged in discussions " with @entity183 's panel to " better understand and prioritize " requests			0
@entity1 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
