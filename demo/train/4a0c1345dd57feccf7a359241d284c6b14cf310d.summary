-- go to any provincial city in @entity2 -- small hayseed towns where the population barely nudges three million people -- and you 'd be forgiven for thinking the national youth pastimes , after smoking , are online gaming and flirting			1
" i like the personality tests and i like chatting with people , but i have n't been brave enough to meet anyone yet , " says @entity10 from @entity11 in @entity2 's central @entity13 province			1
the 20 - year - old student says she uses social media more than she cares to admit			1
" i still use [ microblogging website ] @entity20 for a lot of things but new things like @entity24 come up all the time -- this one is pretty good actually			2
if i shake my mobile , it finds new people for me to meet and to compete with			0
" i like the fact that it uses traditional @entity2 games like truth or dare -- you can think up things that will be funny or embarrass the other person			1
" launched in june , @entity24 is a new mobile phone app that combines games and online chat			1
the @entity40 - based start - up launched with $ 4.2 million in seed funding and since then has gone from strength to strength			1
even outside @entity2 , it has proved sticky , recently hitting the number two position in @entity46			2
for @entity50 , the brains behind @entity24 , elbowing a space into @entity2 's crowded and ferociously competitive social networking space requires financial backing but , more than this , it demands a keen eye for how young subscribers are using the net			1
" we have four million users which makes it one of the fastest growing mobile apps in @entity2 , " @entity50 told @entity0			1
" more than 90 % of the users were born after 1990 so they 're below the age of 24			0
" these people are the most active on social networks in @entity2			2
" throwing a good party @entity24 uses location - based technology that allows users to meet strangers through playing games			1
as well as the usual @entity72 - style feed and group chat , the app hosts quizzes , competitive games , horoscopes and the staple of teenagers everywhere on the net : personality tests			2
" a lot of social networks out there enable you to meet someone and just start chatting [ and ] sharing pictures , " said @entity50			1
" that 's great but the next generation should be able to interact in a much more fun way			0
" @entity50 likens @entity24 to throwing a good party			1
" we see mobile social apps as something like an amusement park -- you come and you 're always playing with other people ; you meet them in a ' no pressure ' way , " he says			1
" if you throw a party with good music , good drinks and good food , if you have a good theme -- maybe it 's 1920s and everyone wears a @entity108 hat -- then everyone has a good time			0
" but if you throw a singles ' party just to find the member of the opposite sex of your dreams , then it 's not going to be very much fun			0
" we are creating all the amusements -- all the food and the drink -- and marrying it to a social platform			0
it might seem to be pretty obvious but no one has thought of it before			0
" strong growth while @entity72 still dominates the social media landscape globally with 1.32 billion monthly active users ( @entity131 ) , its @entity2 rivals are starting to close the gap			1
@entity133 , which runs the massively popular @entity135 instant messaging service , is second on the list with 645 million @entity131			0
other @entity2 sites such as @entity138 , or @entity138 as it is known in @entity2 , have gained as many as 438 million @entity131 in a short few years , stealing a march in terms of numbers on sites like @entity144			1
@entity144 , @entity72 and @entity145 have been locked out of the @entity2 market since 2009 , leaving the field open to homegrown social media sites such as @entity20 and @entity149			1
while some say the ban is motivated by a need to censor the web in @entity2 , most analysts believe that protectionism for its own domestic versions of @entity145 - namely @entity157 and @entity158 - has been behind the move			2
nevertheless , the progress of @entity2 social media is keenly monitored in the @entity162 where companies such as @entity72 and @entity165 hope to one day re-enter the market			1
" @entity24 is just one of many of these new startups -- but these are up against very big companies			2
they 're only getting a small slice of the pie , " says analyst @entity169 of @entity170			0
" the most popular social platform used to be @entity20 -- which combines elements of @entity72 and @entity144 -- but mobile messaging apps are now the most popular apps like @entity138 from @entity178			0
" but she says the growth of anonymous social networking platforms are now the latest development in @entity2 -- not unsurprising in the light of the strict controls the government places on online debates			2
" sites such as @entity189 and @entity190 are gaining more and more users -- it wo n't become mainstream however , " @entity169 says			0
" when it 's anonymous , users are more willing to share information			0
users may have nicknames , but behind those nicknames are real social connections , friends and colleagues			0
" fittingly , @entity189 literally translates as " no secrets " while @entity190 means " secrets "			0
as for @entity24 , users are as anonymous or as open as they want to be			2
" so far , i have n't been bothered to meet anyone off any of the games , " says @entity10			0
" but who knows , one day i might put on some make up and a nice dress , " she jokes .			0
