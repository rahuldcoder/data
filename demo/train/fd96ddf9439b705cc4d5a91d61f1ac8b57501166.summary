-- when it comes to the creatures most likely to be spotted swimming down @entity5 's @entity4 , hippos will be far down the list			1
thanks to @entity10 artist @entity9 , eagle - eyed visitors to @entity5 might just spot the three humps of an enormous hippo appearing from the @entity4 ' murky depths			1
@entity9 is known for his super-sized , colorful works of art , most recently the enormous inflatable rubber duck that floated around the waters of cities like @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
earlier this year , @entity9 was asked to create a piece of artwork by the organizers of @entity26 , an annual festival that celebrates @entity5 's famous river			1
he says he started by researching the history of the river , and eventually came across studies on hippo evolution that revealed its waters were awash with the large creatures hundreds of thousands of years ago			0
the result was an artwork he 's christened with a pun almost as heavy as one of the beasts he 's been studying : " @entity41			2
" " i wanted to use the hippo to get people out of their homes , away from the @entity45 and the tv , and to explore @entity5 with a new perspective			1
" not that creating a giant replica of an ungainly water mammal in one of the @entity52 's busiest waterways is an easy business			1
cocktail of ingredients " i was thinking about the history , but i also had to think about practicalities , " @entity9 says			1
" we needed to make sure it could fit under various bridges as it had to be towed into place , so it 's a cocktail of ingredients : the history of @entity5 , cost and the size of the space available			1
" like several of @entity9 's other pieces , " @entity41 " was inspired by everyday objects -- in this case a children 's book that the artist 's parents gave him for their grandchild			1
" one page had an illustration of a hippo and i saw it and thought that it could work really well			2
so the installation is something which is partly inspired by a found object , " he says			1
it 's a process @entity9 has used in the past , chiefly the enormous cuddly toys that formed his 2009 exhibition at the @entity86 and the ornament - like sparrow statues he created for @entity91 's @entity90 music festival			1
" ' these pieces were inspired by children 's toys or items picked up from flea markets i 've visited -- mass - produced toys and animal ceramics , " he says			1
" it 's not just about the animal -- it 's about the outer skin			2
i 'm all about beauty and the design of an object and i like to use and change these found objects by giving them different skins			1
" i love the fact that so many of them are made in @entity112 and @entity113			0
" they 're sent to the @entity115 and @entity116 and they 're in the hands of children for just a few minutes			0
i have a love for these objects and the way they get circulated around the world			2
" @entity125 is also key			0
" i have a love of beautiful places -- both urban and rural , and i like to show them in their natural state , " the artist explains			2
giant yellow bunny @entity9 claims an enormous yellow bunny he installed in the town of @entity135 , @entity136 , helped highlight a largely forgotten statue it was sited next to			1
" the bunny was removed after three months but afterward , more people started to visit the spot			0
that 's the b - side of my installations : they give the public space back to the people who then see it with a new perspective			1
" @entity9 's work has taken him all over the world and certain destinations have left their mark			1
" i love @entity20 , " he says			0
" i love the people			0
" every morning you wake up and you meet people who become your friends			0
" it 's a concrete jungle where , as a human , you 're downsized , but i like the strength and the love of the people and the way they live together			0
" the @entity164 country of @entity165 also makes his list of favorites , as does the @entity169 town of @entity170 , largely because of the way residents interact with its river in the summer			0
" it 's the biggest artwork you can make - it 's a social , natural thing and it changes people 's perspective of the city			2
" different nationalities react to his work in different ways , he says			0
" in @entity116 , the first question will be about the cost			0
in @entity184 and @entity185 people will ask , ' what is it and why is it there ? ' " no more ducks " in @entity184 , people work six or seven days a week , perhaps two jobs a day			2
they 'll have sundays off and they make the most of their spare time			0
" in those rare moments they enjoy life to the max and are more open to certain things			0
" if people have less spare time they feel they should make full use of it			0
" in @entity116 , people work hard but they have more spare time and there 's a different pace			2
people tend to be more spoiled			0
" @entity211 's own spare time on the sidelines of the @entity5 festival is likely to spent in one of the city 's pubs , he says			1
" i love the pub life in @entity5 , as well as the parks			2
if you step into any pub , people will talk to you			0
" it 's quite open , and they have a wonderful sense of humor -- you can have a great evening socializing			0
" @entity9 says " @entity41 " will be his final water - based project			1
it appears that the popularity of his most recent project was a double - edged sword			0
" after the rubber duck it was hard to come up with another water - related installation , " he says			1
" people just want another duck ! " @entity237 is a freelance travel writer based in the @entity52 .			0
