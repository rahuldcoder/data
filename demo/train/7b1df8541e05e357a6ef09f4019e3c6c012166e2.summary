-- @entity1 and @entity2 hit the campaign trail thursday to pitch energy policy and defense spending , as new polls showed president @entity7 maintaining a slight lead in three key swing states after @entity1 named the conservative @entity11 chairman as his running mate			1
four days ahead of the @entity13 , certain presidential nominee @entity1 sought to build momentum with a continued focus on his economic policies mixed with attacks on @entity7 's handling of a stalling recovery			1
however , the controversy this week over @entity22 rep. @entity22 's incendiary remarks on " legitimate " rape and pregnancy has dominated the political chatter and raised questions about whether the conservative @entity27 from suburban @entity28 can unseat vulnerable @entity30 sen. @entity29 in @entity31			1
threat against @entity22 being investigated seeking to regain control of the campaign message , @entity1 traveled to @entity35 to discuss a plan that he says will make @entity38 energy independent by 2020 -- which would coincide with the conclusion of his second presidential term , if he gets elected twice			1
touting the country 's newly accessible oil and gas reserves , @entity1 repeated familiar themes -- fewer federal regulations , more oil drilling -- that he said would wean the country off imported oil and spark an economic boom at home			1
democrats : our convention will stall @entity1 he called for states to have control over drilling on federal land within their borders ; opening new offshore areas to energy development ; starting a fast - track approval process for energy projects including nuclear power , and limiting the ability of environmental groups to file lawsuits			1
acknowledging that conventional sources of oil were dwindling , @entity1 said the new production would come from places like the deepwater @entity73 , @entity75 's oil sands and shale formations			1
@entity0 electoral map : do the math in a position paper on the issue , @entity1 listed benefits from achieving energy independence as 3 million new jobs , $ 1 trillion in government revenues , a stronger dollar and lower energy prices			2
however , a recent report by the nonpartisan @entity88 was less sanguine			0
the @entity88 report , which was requested by @entity2 , said 70 % of the nation 's oil and gas reserves already were available for drilling			1
opening the rest , it said , would increase government receipts from an estimated $ 150 billion under current policy to $ 175 billion to $ 200 billion over the next 10 years			0
strippers count on @entity22 spending when asked to explain the difference , a @entity1 staffer said the campaign 's projections were more inclusive and stretched out over a longer time period			1
@entity7 has touted increased oil production in recent years , and also opened up new areas for drilling in the @entity73 and indicated he 'll issue permits to drill in the @entity110			1
@entity7 's troubled solar ' poster boy ' at the same time , the administration has increased environmental and safety standards for offshore drilling and tightened emissions rules on power plants			1
the current administration has also issued fewer permits for drilling than @entity121 , largely due to the moratorium imposed after the @entity124 spill in 2010			0
on thursday , @entity1 criticized @entity7 's support for renewable energy subsidies and highlighted companies that have received government funding and then gone bankrupt , such as @entity129 and @entity130			1
@entity131 moms not tipping their hand the administration has repeatedly defended its decision to invest in renewable energy companies , noting that energy from wind and solar projects have doubled since @entity7 took office			2
" the @entity22 approach is essentially one that is written by or dictated by big oil and it focuses almost entirely on oil and fossil fuels , " @entity141 press secretary @entity140 said thursday			1
@entity1 has said he would not support extending the federal subsidy for wind power , which expires at the end of the year			2
he called thursday for the government to support advanced energy development at the basic research level , not at the commercialization phase			0
@entity2 , meanwhile , spoke about about military spending at a defense industry roundtable in @entity157 , @entity158			2
the event came a day after a new @entity88 report outlined the potentially dismal impact of the impending " fiscal cliff " that includes the expiration of the @entity121 tax cuts and mandatory reductions in government spending , including defense outlays			0
@entity169 , supporters change strategy the scheduled automatic cuts -- known as sequestration -- came about as a result of a compromise budget measure passed into law after congressional negotiations failed to agree on a deficit - reduction plan last year			0

" show us your budget , @entity2 demands now , he and @entity1 call the looming " fiscal cliff " an example of @entity7 's failed leadership			1

" under a @entity1 administration , this will not happen , " @entity2 said of the automatic cuts to military spending			1
" we will reverse these reckless , devastating defense cuts that the president is bringing us toward			0
" at the @entity141 , @entity140 said a quick solution to the issue would come if @entity22 ease their rigid opposition to ending tax cuts for wealthy @entity38			0
