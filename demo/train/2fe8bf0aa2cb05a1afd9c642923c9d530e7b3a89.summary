-- two @entity2 teens will serve time in a county jail for participating in a brawl that left a @entity7 immigrant dead last july			2
@entity8 and @entity10 's joint trial began in late april in @entity11 , @entity2			1
@entity8 , 17 , was sentenced to 6 to 23 months , and @entity10 , 19 , received 7 to 23 months for their roles in the beating death of 25 - year - old @entity15			1
judge @entity16 ordered the two to report to @entity17 on july 19 to begin serving their sentences			1
an all - white jury convicted the two former high school football players of misdemeanor simple assault at trial last month and acquitted them of felony counts , including aggravated assault , ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension -- charges that carried lengthier sentences			1
in fashioning his sentence , @entity16 acknowledged the severity of the attack , which left @entity15 on life support for two days before he died , but said he could pass a sentence only in accordance with the jury 's verdict			1
" this was n't any fight , this was a group of young athletes ganging up on one person			0
that 's not a street fight , " @entity16 said , referring to the defense team 's characterization of the confrontation as a " street fight			1
" " you picked out a guy who was n't one of you and beat the pulp out of him , " @entity16 said			0
the incident divided the small , rural mining town of @entity55 into camps for and against the boys as it became a flashpoint for racial tensions across the country			2
after the verdict , gov. @entity61 sent a letter to @entity65 attorney general @entity64 recommending that the @entity66 pursue civil rights charges			2
" the evidence suggests that mr. @entity15 was targeted , beaten and killed because he was @entity7 , " @entity61 said			1
" such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance			2
" during wednesday 's sentencing , @entity16 said he was surprised that @entity61 had chosen to speak out on the case and told the court that his sentence was not affected by the governor 's letter			1
@entity84 , @entity8 's lawyer , said he felt the sentence was harsh , given the circumstances			1
the judge could have sentenced the teens to probation under @entity2 's sentencing guidelines			1
" i 'm disappointed that the court exceeded the aggravated range and sentenced him to six months			1
having said that , i 'm glad we finally have some finality with this case , " @entity84 told @entity0 affiliate @entity94 after the sentencing			0
@entity16 heard from several teachers , coaches and family friends who testified that the teens were good kids who fell into a bad situation			0
they urged leniency so the teens could realize their potential as adults			0
@entity15 's longtime girlfriend and mother of two of his children read a statement in open court before an audience consisting mostly of the defendants ' supporters			1
" he was my one and only love , and they took him away from me , and they took my children 's father , " @entity119 said			0
" now i have to live without my best friend and love of my life			0
" the court also heard a prepared statement from @entity15 's mother , @entity130 , who lives in @entity131 , @entity7			1
" i 'm not the same person as before , now i feel a great emptiness within my heart , " she wrote			0
" there are moments in which i 'm alone and i ask myself : what do i do now that i do n't have my son ? i feel that without him , i am no one			0
" the judge also tacked on extra days to each boy 's sentence for consuming alcohol earlier in the evening			0
for providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight , @entity10 was also convicted of corrupting minors			2
jurors found @entity8 not guilty of third - degree murder			2
prosecutors had said he delivered a fatal kick to @entity15 's head after @entity15 was knocked to the ground in the alcohol - fueled brawl , which occurred on a residential street in @entity55 the evening of july 12			1
prosecutors alleged that a group of teens , which included @entity8 and @entity10 , baited @entity15 into the initial confrontation after a night of drinking , hurling racial epithets at the undocumented @entity7 immigrant			1
after the fight broke up , witnesses said @entity15 came back at the teens , who beat him so severely that , according to a medical testimony , brain tissue oozed out of his skull during surgery at a hospital			2
jurors heard from several teens who witnessed the incident but did not participate , as well as one teen who pleaded guilty in juvenile court and another whose case is being handled in federal court			0
the testimony painted a picture of confusion , with several inconsistencies as to who did what			0
defense lawyers argued that @entity15 's death was a street brawl gone wrong that was not motivated by racial bias			1
they also suggested that @entity15 was responsible for triggering the second confrontation			2
advocacy groups condemned the verdict and sentences , and called on the @entity66 to bring federal hate crime charges against the defendants			1
" the meager sentences handed to the defendants today leaves justice gasping for further redress , " said @entity195 , staff attorney for the @entity196			0
citing @entity203 statistics , @entity201 said that hate crimes against @entity205 have risen 40 percent in the last five years and called on @entity206 to strengthen hate crime laws			0
" the failure to hold these defendants responsible for their atrocious crimes denies justice not just to the @entity15 family , but also to the entire community by failing to deter similar crimes in the future , " she said			2
@entity216 , president and ceo of the @entity218 , said the case had troubling implications in the wider context of race relations nationwide			0
" since the year 2000 , we 've seen a 50 percent surge in the number of hate groups across the country , to a record 926 by our latest count , " he said			0
" the increase has been fueled by the same factor responsible for the rise in the @entity233 hate crimes -- a backlash against the changing demographics of our country , a backlash fueled by politicians trolling for votes and pundits looking for ratings			0
" @entity0 's @entity243 and @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
