-- young , urban and culturally savvy , meet the @entity1 -- a new generation of @entity3 and people of @entity6 descent with a very global outlook			1
something of a buzzword in the diaspora , the term " @entity9 " first appeared in a 2005 magazine article by @entity16 / @entity15 writer @entity14			1
@entity14 wrote about multilingual africans with different ethnic mixes living around the globe -- as she put it " not citizens but @entity3 of the world			1
" now the term has spread , used not just by @entity25 hipsters and in trendy @entity27 capitals but in @entity6 's own multicultural megacities			2
but just who are these @entity1 ? @entity30 is the editor of @entity9 magazine , produced in @entity6			1
a @entity32 based in @entity33 , who has lived in @entity35 , she has the kind of international background that typifies an @entity38			2
" i have @entity6 roots but i 've kind of been raised by the world , and that 's helped form my identity , " she says			1
see also : @entity44 's designer dandies her magazine is aimed at successful urban 30 - somethings -- intelligent , upwardly mobile and politically aware -- most of whom she says can be described as @entity1			2
" @entity9 is someone who has roots in @entity6 , raised by the world , but still has an interest in the continent and is making an impact , is feeding back into the continent and trying to better it , " according to @entity30			1
she also believes the term can apply to non-africans			2
" we like to think that it does n't matter where you were born , if you find yourself on the continent and you love the continent , that makes you an @entity9 , " says @entity30			1
but for some people the term is n't so easy to define			0
@entity69 is a @entity16 journalist who is based in @entity70			0
he studied for his masters degree in @entity73 and last year chaired a debate at @entity35 's @entity76 museum on what it means to be an @entity38			0
he says it 's a problematic term and its meaning is hard to pin down			0
" it 's one of those words that people invest with their own meanings , people interpret it as they want , " he says			0
" some people dismiss the concept entirely , saying there 's nothing that people who are called @entity93 share in common -- what they have in common is superficial			0
" he feels the term is too often applied only to those living in the diaspora			0
" it 's a problematic term because it 's supposed to combine ( the words ) @entity6 and cosmopolitan , " says @entity69			0
" what it should mean is an @entity6 person in an urban environment , with the outlook and mindset that comes with urbanization -- people who live @entity70 , @entity107 , and have this world - facing outlook			1
" but people who consider themselves @entity38 are not here in the continent , they are out there in the global capitals			0
" see also : sounds of the @entity115 @entity116 , who blogs as @entity117 , is a true global citizen			1
born in @entity118 to a @entity16 father and a @entity118 mother she has lived in @entity16 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity25 , and now lives in @entity35			0
she agrees that some people see @entity125 as existing only outside @entity6 , but says that , in reality , it applies just as much to people living in the continent			0
" some people have interpreted it as a diaspora movement but it absolutely is n't , " she says			0
" when you go back to the original term ' @entity6 and cosmopolitanism , ' @entity6 has very many cosmopolitan cities ... and in those cities you have art scenes and music and all kinds of creativity that 's influenced by cosmopolitanism			2
" for her it 's a movement that is politically aware and has an obligation to correct decades of @entity6 being misrepresented as a " dark , failing continent			0
" " @entity1 are a group of people who are either of @entity6 origin or influenced by @entity6 culture , who are emerging internationally using @entity6 cultures in creative ways to change perceptions about @entity6 , " @entity116 says			1
@entity116 adds that social media has been key to the movement , creating global citizens who are in tune with the same cultural trends and political issues			1
he says that while ordinary @entity16 do n't define themselves as @entity93 , the prevalence of the internet and satellite television means young @entity16 do have a global outlook and are exposed to much of the same pop culture as youngsters all over the world			1
and social media also means that the coolest in contemporary @entity6 culture is quick to travel around the world			1
@entity6 and @entity6 - influenced pop culture is a key part of the movement			1
@entity125 implies a certain type of cool , with an aesthetic influenced by @entity177 and a soundtrack provided by anyone from @entity16 musician @entity180 to @entity6 " township tech " producer @entity181			2
but @entity30 insists that to be a true @entity38 takes more than a multi-cultural background and the right record collection -- it means having a commitment to making the continent a better place			0
she says : " from philanthropic work to trying to lobby for political reform there 's a lot that needs to be done in @entity6 and if you 're going to call yourself an @entity38 you need to show what you 're doing to deserve to be called an @entity9			2
