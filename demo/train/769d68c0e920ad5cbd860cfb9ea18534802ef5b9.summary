@entity0 , @entity1 -- with a wink of its eye , @entity3 brought to close the @entity7 by making fun of one the glitches that plagued the first week of the games			1
as the closing ceremonies began , a mime with a tool belt came out to the caldron , where one of the legs was still in the floor of @entity18 , having failed to rise during the opening ceremonies 17 days ago			0
the mime found the power cords were n't connected , but when he plugged it in , sparks flew from the power supply			0
the mime found a rope and pretended to pull the fourth leg up into place as the crowd roared its approval			0
it was with a smile that @entity3 wrapped up the games , having won the most gold medals any nation has won in any @entity7 and having won back the hockey gold medal it feels should permanently reside here			1
it was a 180 - degree reversal from the way the games began when critics complained about the warm , rainy weather , observers criticized the safety of the track after the death of a luger in a training run and @entity3 wondered what was going on with the caldron and their athletes , for whom officials from the host nation had predicted overwhelming success			1
as the opening ceremonies came to a close , speed skating legend @entity53 was left there , with her torch , wondering what to do			0
and @entity3 asked themselves : what next ? @entity53 got her chance to light the caldron after all			2
as the mime raised the stubborn leg during the closing ceremonies , @entity53 came out beaming with her torch			0
she was n't the only @entity3 beaming sunday			1
despite a slow first week on the tracks , rinks and courses of the games , the home team became a story of resiliency and national pride			0
@entity74 , who lost her beloved mother to a heart attack two days before she was to compete in the first night of figure skating , was chosen as the @entity3 flag bearer for the closing ceremonies			1
the 24 - year - old skater will long be remembered as the symbol of these games for her strength in a time of personal crisis			0
@entity74 skated flawlessly in that first night of the competition , then dazzled the crowd in the free skate , winning the bronze medal , the hearts of a nation and the respect of those watching around the world			1
years from now , they will talk of her strength and her bravery , but she just saw herself as the daughter who shared a dream with a mother who would n't let her fail			0
she was n't perfect in her performance , but in an imperfect games , she was a beacon of all that is right about sports			0
the head of the host organization said his nation was proud of the way it had revealed itself to each other and to the world			0
" i believe we @entity3 tonight are stronger , more united , more in love with our country and more connected with each other than ever before , " @entity113 , chief executive officer of @entity114 , said			2
" these @entity119 have lifted us up			0
if the @entity3 that came together on opening night was a little mysterious , it no longer is			2
now you know us , eh ? " watch @entity3 fans celebrate in the streets the rest of the closing ceremony became a lighthearted tribute to @entity3 , featuring comedians and some of its most famous singers , like @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			2
even as thousands of fans and reporters were arriving the first week , it almost seemed as if the games were a national embarrassment			0
the problems actually started a month before the @entity7 opened , as @entity0 went through the warmest january in history			2
the well - above - freezing temperatures caused some observers to call these the @entity141			0
@entity114 officials said that while it was n't the weather they expected when they won the bid for the games in 2003 , it really would n't prevent the outdoor events from taking place			0
during those first rough days , @entity3 officials tried to reassure the nation and the world that the host country would do well on medals , and that they had planned for weather pitfalls			1
with the @entity7 closing sunday night , you could almost hear the voices of @entity3 officials saying , " we told you everything would work out			1
" it was on the slopes of @entity160 where two of the most compelling stories of these @entity7 unfolded			2
one belonged to @entity163 , the @entity164 skier who had dominated the @entity165			2
she was a medal favorite in four of the five @entity119 events she entered , but on the eve of the games , she suffered a major shin injury			0
the weather delays gave her more time to heal			0
she won two medals , a gold in the downhill and a bronze in the @entity177 , but crashed in her other three events			1
on the other end of the spectrum was former bad boy @entity181 , who made more news partying at the @entity183 than he did on the slopes			0
but 2010 will be remembered for how he redeemed himself by skiing to three medals , including a gold in the super combined			2
he became the most decorated @entity164 @entity189 in history			2
speed skater @entity191 also wrote himself into the @entity164 medals record book with a silver in the 1,500 meters short track final , a bronze in the 1,000 meters and a bronze in the relay			1
with eight medals , he has won more medals than any other @entity164 @entity201 in history			1
other athletes who impressed : @entity204 of @entity205 was the leading medal winner of the games , taking home five medals in cross-country skiing --- three gold , one silver and one bronze			1
short track speed skater @entity213 of @entity215 , who won three golds ( 1,000 meters , 1,500 , relay )			2
@entity205 's @entity218 , who won his sixth career @entity7 gold , in the 4x7.5km cross-country skiing relay			1
@entity223 's @entity222 , who won two individual gold medals in biathlon , and then gave up her spot in the relay so a teammate would have a chance to medal ; @entity232 's @entity231 , who won bronze in the women 's sprint cross-country skiing race , despite racing through the heats with four broken ribs suffered in a training run			1
medalists share @entity119 memories the medals podium belonged to the @entity164 , despite the " @entity243 " program -- with its millions of dollars poured in by the @entity3 government -- that the folks from the host nation bragged would make them the top team at the games			1
in the end , while they owned the top step , their neighbors borrowed the podium for 17 days			0
the @entity164 won a record 37 medals			1
the total included golds by the four - man bobsled team led by driver @entity257 , the first gold medal ever by a skier in @entity260 ( @entity261 ) , and the expected brilliance of @entity263 in the snowboard halfpipe			1
despite a slow start and some disappointments in events that were supposed to be almost sure things , the @entity3 won a record number of gold medals			1
that number included men 's hockey , beating the @entity164 3 - 2 in overtime -- a dream result for the host nation			2
the games had started in the most awful , sobering way possible , with the news of the death of @entity282 luger @entity281			1
his fatal training accident called into question he safety of the track and spotlighted the fact that @entity3 athletes had had far more training time on the tracks , slopes and facilities of these games			1
members of the @entity1 press blamed @entity281 's death on the organizers ' " lust for glory			0
" the criticism stung , but @entity3 officials and fans were resilient			0
if you do n't know the words to " @entity306 , " you have not been in @entity0 these past two weeks			0
it was being sung everywhere , in bars , on the streets , in arenas , even during low points such as @entity3 's loss to the @entity164 by 5 - 3 in the men 's hockey preliminary rounds			1
and whoever makes @entity317 flags probably has already made a year or two 's worth of profit .			0

@entity7 end sunday with @entity3 *claiming* most gold , @entity164 most total medals
these @entity7 needed saving after death of @entity282 luger in training accident
no gold medal was as *inspiring* as bronze won by figure skater @entity74
