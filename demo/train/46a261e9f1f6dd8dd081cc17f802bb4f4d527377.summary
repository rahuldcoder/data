-- i have 711 photos stored on my @entity3 , but none of them is a " selfie			2
" that could disqualify me from commenting on the choice of that neologism , coined in 2002 , as the @entity11 " @entity10			1
" on the other hand , i do own an old two - volume microprint edition of the @entity11 and read it on occasion for pleasure with the use of a magnifying glass			2
so give me a shot			0
the editors at @entity20 describe " selfie " as an informal noun and define it as " a photograph that one has taken of oneself , typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website			1
" they note that frequency of the word has increased in a year by 17,000 percent			1
@entity32 , who spent a famous year reading the monumental @entity11 from beginning to end , alerts me that words selected for such an honor " arouse a certain skepticism and derision " among many wordinistas			2
he notes that this honor is the work of the @entity41			0
as for the more famous @entity11 , a press release notes that " @entity43 is not yet in the @entity20 ( @entity11 ) , but is currently being considered for future inclusion			1
" though i 've never taken a selfie , i have made cameo appearances in the cell phone photos of others			2
i enjoy this experience , especially at book fairs , where an eager reader may seek a souvenir photo with the author			0
the result can be quite endearing and funny , especially when it exaggerates the gauge of my nostrils , making my schnozz look like a double - barreled shotgun			0
before the cell phone , the best way to get this effect was to drop a quarter into a photo booth at the mall or the arcade			1
i wonder if there is an @entity67 anywhere who has not been pictured on one of those four - photo strips , usually accompanied by a girlfriend or several drunken classmates			1
even in the age of the selfie , these booths have made a comeback , especially at weddings and reunions			0
at my daughter 's wedding , you could slip into the booth with one or more companions , mug for the camera , see yourself on a computer monitor , take a strip home as a memento , and donate a strip to the bride and groom , creating an instant album of happy faces			0
in that context , a selfie is a good thing , with that diminutive ending , suggesting the creation of a " little self			0
" think of the selfie , then , as a virtual " mini-me , " what in ancient biology might have been called a " homunculus " -- a tiny pre-formed person that would grow into the big self			1
or maybe there 's a dark side to this moon			0
maybe the connotation of selfie should be selfish : self - absorbed , narcissistic , the center of our own universe , a hall of mirrors in which each reflection is our own			1
it would fit the times , of course , an era in which selfies decorate the narratives of our social networks			0
here i am at my reunion ! look at me with @entity129 ! ! check out my new boob job ! ! ! it 's me , my selfie , and i. in the past , it took some kind of human connection , or tricky photography , to capture your self - image			1
" excuse me , sir , can you please take our picture ? " it happened to me last week outside the @entity142 in @entity143			0
three young women wanted to pose in front of a poster of musical theater star @entity147			0
so the @entity10 brainiacs probably got it right			2
i ca n't think of any other word that so captures our confusing and contradictory culture , so technologically forward looking and so personally self - obsessed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			2

@entity156 : the @entity20 has named " selfie " " @entity10 "
he says word of year picks can sometimes be derided by word nerds
he says selfies are fun , like photo booth picture strips ; they are like " mini-me " pictures
@entity156 : word captures our culture : technologically forward looking , self - obsessed
