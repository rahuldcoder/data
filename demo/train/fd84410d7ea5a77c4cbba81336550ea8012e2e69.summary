@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 politicians traded insults and accusations following new talks with president @entity7 to broker a coalition government , an effort that will resume monday			1
@entity7 called together the leaders of the three biggest parties sunday , a week after indecisive elections and three failed attempts to form a government raised the possibility of new elections in the debt - stricken country			1
his office announced late sunday that those talks would continue monday morning			1
after the meeting , the leader of the radical leftist @entity23 coalition said other parties wanted @entity23 to be their " partners in crime , " adding : " we ca n't do that			1
" @entity23 leader @entity28 suggested the two other largest parties , @entity29 and @entity30 , were going to form a coalition with a smaller group , the @entity32			1
but the @entity32 issued a statement calling @entity28 's remarks " a disgrace , " and accusing him of lying and slandering the smaller party			2
@entity37 is keeping a nervous eye on @entity0 , fearing that the political chaos there could lead to defaults on debt that could threaten the future of the euro			1
@entity0 failure -- or refusal -- to make debt payments could hurt banks across @entity37			1
the talks with @entity7 came a week after elections in which angry voters punished mainstream parties by backing a range of fringe groups			1
@entity32 leader @entity55 held his own meeting with @entity7 late sunday			2
so did @entity57 , the head of the far - right @entity58			0
@entity57 emerged from talks saying any new government would need an internationally respected premier with the clout to reject the bailout package the previous government signed , calling the deal " a crime against our country			1
" if no government can be cobbled together by may 17 , new elections must be called			1
they would take place next month			0
@entity7 said he hoped he could help form a unity government , adding that " things in @entity0 are quite difficult " -- but things only looked more difficult after sunday 's talks			1
@entity28 , whose party came in second last week on a platform of rejecting the conditions that international lenders have placed on the country , said that @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity32 could form a majority government without the backing of his party			1
polls suggest that @entity23 , which came second in voting last week , would come first if another round of elections is held			0
" the three parties have 168 seats together			0
they can go ahead with that			0
they are pressuring us to participate , and that is an irrational and unprecedented request			0
they want us to give a fake sense of legalization , " he said			0
but the @entity32 said it had not agreed to back a coalition without @entity23 , and said of @entity28 : " his obvious inability to justify his stance should not lead him to slander and lie			0
this is an unethical political act on his part			0
" @entity108 , leader of the @entity30 , said after the meeting that his party would do everything possible to form a national unity government , but that they were ready for new elections if necessary			1
@entity108 had gone to @entity7 on saturday to admit he could not form a government , making him the third politician in a week to fail to form a coalition			1

@entity7 met @entity117 , @entity108 and @entity28 together on sunday			1
the president will hold talks with the leaders of smaller parties later in the day			1
@entity132 leader @entity131 complained about the way @entity7 was organizing the meetings , saying all party leaders should meet together			1
the @entity136 , meanwhile , called for new elections , saying they will not participate in a coalition government			1
four out of five voters said they would vote the same way in a new election , according to a poll published saturday by the newspaper @entity143			1
three out of five said they believed new elections would be held soon , and just over half said they were not happy with the results of the vote on may 6			2
in a separate poll published sunday by the newspaper @entity151 , seven out of 10 people said they wanted the parties to form a coalition government			1
@entity23 would come top if new elections were held , the @entity151 poll suggested , after coming in second behind @entity29 a week ago			2
but the results would still lead to a deeply divided parliament , the poll suggested , with no party getting more than 21 % of the vote			1
in the same poll , six out of 10 voters said @entity23 's plans were not realistic			0
party leader @entity28 made a radical speech last week against austerity			2
the @entity151 poll appeared to show a fall in support for @entity23 since mid-week , when a survey put them first with 28 % of the vote			0
in sunday 's poll they had the support of 20.5 % of respondents			0
a poll by @entity179 analysis published on saturday gave them 20.2 %			0
@entity23 came in second in last week 's election with 16.8 %			0
the party is opposed to the terms of the bailout agreed with the @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
the country 's lenders have said that if @entity0 does not comply with the bailout terms then payments will stop			2
deep uncertainty surrounds the political situation in @entity0 after large numbers of voters in last sunday 's election backed parties opposed to the country 's bailout deal			1
severe austerity measures are required under the terms of the bailout , agreed to by the outgoing coalition government of @entity30 and @entity29			0
headlines in saturday 's papers talk about " @entity206 " and " opening the door to an exit from the euro			0
" @entity0 has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts so far			2
but last week 's election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the economic measures , which include policies to cut spending and raise taxes to reduce public debts			2
seven parties won seats in parliament , but none captured more than 19 % of the vote , leading to a week of political turmoil			0
the stakes are potentially huge for the rest of the eurozone , the group of 17 @entity37 countries that use the euro as single currency			0
there is concern that the lack of leadership could jeopardize @entity0 's bailout agreement			2
that could lead to a disorderly default by @entity0 , which would force the nation out of the eurozone			2
a default by @entity0 also could drag down other troubled governments such as @entity246 and @entity247			2
the eurozone economy is fragile , and any financial shock could plunge the region into a deep recession , a development that would ripple across the globe			0
