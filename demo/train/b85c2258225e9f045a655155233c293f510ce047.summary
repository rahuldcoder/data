until recently , this phrase made me picture @entity4 from " @entity5 " proclaiming " i know kung fu " after he had martial arts abilities uploaded into his brain			1
but what if we really could harness technology , @entity12 , to help train our brains to better cope with everyday stress ? for many of us , the days seem to pass in one anxiety - ridden blur after another			1
mental health professional increasingly agree that these daily sprints , accompanied by a soundtrack of endless beeps , chirps and vibrations emitting from various devices , set off our stress systems , keeping us in a persistent and physiologically damaging state of fight - or - flight			2
" the way we live our lives now is like running marathons , " said dr. @entity27 , a neuroscientist and chief science officer of @entity29 , a company that provides brain training to athletes			1
" and in some ways , that 's great , but you ca n't run marathons all the time			2
" keep that pace , says @entity27 , and at some point , you will burn out			2
you may also suffer from a weakened immune system that can lead to an increased risk of disease			2
most of us have received some kind of formal instruction about diet , exercise , the birds and the bees			2
so why are n't we training our brains to better manage stress ? some of the most compelling training to help prepare people to better handle stress is going on right now with athletes and soldiers			1
for these two distinct groups , performance under high stress is a must ( albeit for very different reasons )			2
but the technologies being used to train them could benefit the rest of us as well			2
technology could help us reduce stress , too training athletes for the field i became interested in the way athletes train for peak performance in high - stakes environments last year , when i interviewed @entity79 , a sports psychologist who works with @entity27 to train elite athletes to perform optimally during high - stress competition			1
@entity79 and @entity27 work with athletes from the @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 as well as @entity86 , golfers and many others			1
what @entity79 told me then was that the key to high performance was a disciplined mind			2
while not exactly news , the methods @entity79 and his colleagues use to teach mental discipline were quite interesting			2
they were using older eastern disciplines like mindfulness , presence , meditation , deep breathing and neurofeedback			2
as part of their training , @entity79 and his colleagues hook up athletes to electrodes and perform a baseline @entity109 : a quantitative electroencephalogram			1
they use the results to create an individualized brain map			1
the map helps these sports psychologists assess and quantify mental aspects of performance like focus , decision speed , reaction time and stress regulation			2
once the brain is mapped , the psychologists conduct half - hour neurofeedback sessions to teach athletes how to reach optimal brain wave patterns			1
in a typical session , the athlete will sit before a large screen as sensors monitoring electrical activity in his or her brain are placed on the scalp			1
the athlete then focuses on achieving desirable brain wave patterns that , in turn , influence what happens on the screen			1
it 's bit like controlling a video game with only your thoughts			2
the version i saw involved cars racing through a desert			0
the training is meant to teach athletes how to respond quickly to stressor stimuli , how to focus during stressful situations , how to recover from errors and finally how to shut down and still their minds when it 's all over			1
these sports psychologists have collected a proprietary brain bank of assessments over years of working with elite athletes			1
they use the brain bank to identify optimal brainwave patterns associated with the highest levels of performance			1
according to @entity27 , it takes roughly 15 to 20 neurofeedback sessions for elite athletes to learn some of these techniques			1
( probably about 30 for you and me , he says			0
) your questions about stress , answered ! originally developed as a technique to measure brain activity in @entity173 pilots during flight simulation exercises , neurofeedback has shown promising initial results for helping retrain the brainwaves of children with adhd and autism and people suffering from chronic migraines			1
in one study , student eye surgeons were trained to significantly improve their surgical skills by regulating their own brainwave activity			0
the method is being examined in a diverse number of other contexts , including to help relieve symptoms of chemotherapy - induced nerve damage			0
controlled , randomized trials will help validate these promising starts			0
the kind of training that the athletes working with @entity79 and @entity27 receive is not available to most of us right now , but it may be in our near future			1
a few weeks ago , @entity27 's company , @entity199 , began beta - testing a dry ( no goo in your hair ) sensor , mobile headphone and tablet system that purports to do the same kind of assessment and training as the older model			0
at least in theory , this might make the product accessible to the rest of us			0
training soldiers for the battlefield a conversation with dr. @entity219 , psychologist and research professor at the @entity222 @entity221 , is like a lesson in applied science fiction , with your mind reeling from " @entity227 " to the original " @entity228			1
" except @entity230 's jaw - dropping efforts are not fiction , nor are they " on the horizon			0
" they are here , now			0
in a collaboration between the military , @entity238 and @entity222 's @entity239 , where he serves as the associate director for medical virtual reality , @entity230 and his colleagues have developed cutting - edge gaming and virtual reality technologies to serve the clinical needs of soldiers			2
one project , @entity248 in @entity249 ( @entity250 ) , helps train service members to have better resilience and emotional coping skills in realistic virtual - reality combat scenarios before they are exposed to the real stresses of combat			1
a second project , called @entity258 ( there is also a @entity260 ) , helps soldiers returning from combat work through their trauma by donning a helmet geared with video goggles , earphones and a scent machine , and revisiting the scene in a virtual reality setting , complete with sound and smell			1
both @entity250 and @entity258 ( and @entity260 ) are based on exposure therapy , which has been effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder			1
the problem with @entity274 is that the person often avoids anything that reminds them of the trauma , and this avoidance begins to generalize to everyday things , says @entity230			0
" it 's a snowball cascade effect			0
the things that evoke the fear and anxiety are no longer directly tied to the original trauma but generalized to the outside world			0
you see people with @entity274 who will no longer leave their house , and if they do , they 're a nervous wreck			0
" the idea , says @entity230 , is to re-create the stressful environment in a doctor 's office , to help the patients confront and challenge the trauma and to give them the tools to better cope emotionally with what happened			0
both of these technologies require specialists and a clinical setting , but @entity301 , a " virtual human " designed for interactive use on the @entity304 , does not			1
though at this point , @entity301 is targeted toward active - duty military personnel , veterans and their families , it may also have wider utility for everyday stress and anxiety			1
@entity314 users can select one of several avatars to talk to when they are feeling stressed out			0
the virtual human coaches can serve as an " online companion for anyone who may be too introverted to seek help , someone who may not want to reach out to a clinician or who may feel stigma about seeing a therapist , " said @entity326 , program manager at the @entity239			0
" @entity301 is not a doc - in - the - box , and it 's not going to make a diagnosis , " @entity326 observed			1
nor is it meant to replace human interaction			0
what @entity301 does do is help those suffering from stress and anxiety symptoms begin the conversation about what they may be going through			1
it may also provide users with more information about what they may be experiencing , suggest local facilities where they can go for care and perhaps even walk them through breathing exercises or stress reduction techniques			0
@entity326 summed up what i find most compelling about @entity301 : " here we are , sitting on a mountain of valuable information about what to do when you 're stressed or feeling depressed			1
you can see how @entity301 can help people access the right information when they need it			1
" imagine the possibilities ! an interactive virtual - reality source for information on stress , anxiety and @entity274 -- the precursor , perhaps , to a real - life version of " @entity227 's " @entity365			0
home sweet home i recently attended a conference in @entity368			0
as i made my way through customs at @entity372 , a customs agent asked me what i did for a living			0
" i write , " i said , " mostly about stress			0
" he stared me down for few moments before saying in a low , gruff tone : " if you really want to understand stress , then you need to spend a day with us here			0
" and here 's the thing : regardless of what we do , most of us are feeling that same way about our runaway lives			0
the genie is out of the bottle , and there is little likelihood of us ever going back to a simpler time ( if there ever was such a thing )			0
so , yes , let 's discuss technology addiction , always being " on , " tech fasting and the need to design devices and apps for greater serenity			0
but let 's also consider how to harness some of these technologies to help us move easier in this new world , @entity407			0
is personalized medicine a myth ?			0

experts are mapping elite athletes ' brains to determine optimal brain wave patterns
@entity416 may be able to retrain the brainwaves of children with adhd and autism
@entity250 and @entity301 are two programs being used to help soldiers returning from war
