-- the flip - flop over the non-mention , and now inclusion , in the @entity5 platform of @entity6 as the capital of @entity8 reflects just how silly and sensitive matters can become in an election year			1
the @entity12 folks were clearly tone deaf on this one , giving the @entity13 a gratuitous advantage to question ( yet again ) the president 's commitment to @entity8			1
after the discord over its omission , the president himself ordered that @entity6 be included in the platform			1
but he has already reaped the worst of both worlds : having too cleverly tried to steer clear of traditional election year pressures on @entity6 , the party is now seen to be capitulating to them			0
first , let 's get something straight			0
the @entity6 issue defies logic and rationality when it comes to our presidential elections			2
presidential candidates say all kinds of things in order to win elections , including repeated commitments to move the @entity42 embassy from @entity43 to @entity6			0
and then , once in office , they turn around and seek ways to avoid doing it			0
despite all of the campaign rhetoric , no administration has changed the bottom line @entity42 position on the embassy , or for that matter the status of @entity6 , since 1967			2
its fate is to be determined in negotiations			0
and here 's a news flash for you			0
should @entity59 become president and serious negotiations start between the @entity8 and @entity62 , his position would conform to that of his predecessors , and might even go further to allow for @entity62 sovereignty in east @entity6			1
@entity5 update platform with reference to @entity6 second , what 's so curious about the flap is that the @entity6 issue is less relevant today than ever			1
there are no prospects for reviving serious @entity8 - @entity62 negotiations			0
taking positions on @entity6 is a thought experiment now			0
and most smart politicians understand this			0
neither the @entity8 prime minister nor the president of the @entity80 are prepared to pay the price for a deal , let alone reach common ground , on @entity6 , the peace process ' most explosive issue			1
to add to that , the region is in turmoil			0
@entity90 's nuclear program is likely to be the big issue in 2013 , not resumption of @entity8 - @entity62 peace talks			1
@entity6 is likely to remain dormant for some time			0
perhaps that 's partly why this year 's @entity13 platform does n't spell out much in detail on @entity6			1
it says only that " we envision two democratic states -- @entity8 with @entity6 as its capital and @entity101			1
" that differs from the platform in 2008 , when the @entity13 actively called for moving the @entity42 embassy to @entity6			2
that year the @entity5 refrained from mentioning moving the embassy , but did assert that @entity6 " is and will remain the capital of @entity8			1
" in fact , looking at past @entity5 platforms , the last time the " moving the embassy " language appeared was in 1984			2
still , it hardly mattered			0
under the past three @entity13 presidents -- @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 -- nothing was done about it			0
and it hardly matters on the substantive side , either			0
what will determine the future of @entity6 depends almost entirely on the @entity8 and the @entity62 and perhaps , if there 's ever a peace process , the @entity124 states that have equities there too			1
not to mention the views of the @entity128 and @entity129 world , assuming they 'd ever agree on anything regarding their respective holy sites			0
but rest assured , whatever is contained in any @entity42 political party 's platform wo n't be very significant			2
indeed , if i were an @entity8 or @entity62 , i would n't count on any @entity42 statement on this or any other issue made during a political campaign			1
clearly , the @entity6 issue continues to resonate politically in the @entity42 , particularly during campaign season			2
does the omission of any reference to @entity6 really say anything at all about @entity12 and his party 's commitment to @entity8 or a sea change on the @entity6 issue ? it is , indeed , intriguing that the 2008 @entity5 platform stated that @entity6 is and will remain the capital of @entity8 and the 2004 and 2000 platforms contained very similar language , but this year the @entity5 had , at first , dared to drop the reference			1
@entity59 was quick to blast the @entity5 for the omission , claiming that the entire party " has embraced president @entity12 's shameful refusal to acknowledge that @entity6 is @entity8 's capital			1
" the initial omission , combined with @entity160 press spokesman @entity159 's fumbling the question about @entity8 's capital several months ago , might have strengthened many people 's belief that @entity12 is changing @entity42 policy			1
but since @entity42 policy , pursued under both @entity5 and @entity13 administrations , has always been that the city 's final status will be determined in negotiations , you have to wonder what precisely those critics mean			2
the president has taken positions on borders and security , but not on @entity6 , although it 's hard to believe that his view will not be close to those of @entity180 , who thinks that east @entity6 should be the capital of a @entity62 state with special arrangements for certain neighborhoods and @entity185 holy sites			2
more likely , the platform 's drafters wanted to steer clear of @entity6 entirely and hoped nobody would notice			2
but of course they did			0
what planet were the drafters who omitted @entity6 living on ? it 's silly season , the campaign is on , the @entity13 see a wedge on @entity8 , and it 's @entity6			1
need i say more ? the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

@entity203 : for some reason , the @entity5 platform omitted @entity6 , then included it
the omission gave @entity59 an opening for questioning @entity12 's commitment ot @entity8 , he says
but @entity6 is hardly relevant now , he says , with peace talks dead and @entity90 the main issue
@entity201 : platforms do n't matter , and politicians know @entity6 's fate is not in their hands
