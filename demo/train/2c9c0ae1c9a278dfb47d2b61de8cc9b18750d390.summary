@entity0 has just announced the three winners of its 2012 competition , showcasing the best in @entity5 innovation			1
the winners , chosen from nearly 300 submissions , were @entity8 , from @entity9 , an app that helps small and medium businesses reduce administrative costs ; @entity13 , from @entity14 , a crowdsourcing platform to encourage middle class @entity5 to invest small amounts in high - growth startups ; and @entity19 , from @entity20 , which is a project management and real - time collaboration tool for businesses			1
the @entity0 competition began in late 2009 as an annual program that aimed to support @entity5 social entrepreneurs using technology to solve societal problems			1
this year 's competition demonstrated again that @entity5 has innovation and a growing number of innovators			1
but now the challenge for technology entrepreneurs is not merely to innovate and create apps , but to turn them into lucrative business ideas			1
read this : 10 @entity5 tech voices to follow on @entity40 during my trips to @entity5 while coordinating the @entity0 competition , i witnessed from the innovators a real desire to innovate and have their voices heard			1
but whilst a technology revolution is taking place in @entity5 , with so many of these young men and women building and creating apps , they still face huge challenges in understanding how to start businesses around their innovations			2
most of the innovators are following trends and their dreams , inspired mostly by the stories of @entity61 and @entity62 making it without a clear business plan or any structured road map when they started their businesses many years ago			0
the reality check has not yet taken place in the minds of @entity5 's innovators and lots of time is being wasted on unrealistic desires			1
young entrepreneurs in @entity5 have a mosaic of demands that need urgent attention			0
policy makers need to start taking the young entrepreneurs seriously , as they are the future of @entity5			0
read this : web savvy @entity5 fuel growth in online shopping the growing number of competitions and gatherings -- like @entity0 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 -- help to give visibility and credibility to these innovators , but this is not enough			1
the young @entity5 innovator needs business skills and funding			2
however , preparatory brainstorming gatherings , where people meet to share ideas , cement relationships and learn , could form the missing link that helps to create a culture of entrepreneurship and trust , that challenges and empowers the technology entrepreneurs to do more for @entity5 , and encourages the funders to support them			2
now the competition is over , with the prize money coming soon into the winners ' bank accounts , what is next for them ? many people are asking this legitimate question			0
one thing is sure , the entrepreneurs have ideas ; the proof is that we have banks of apps being developed from the continent			0
but 90 % of the people who attended the @entity127 sessions , with their business ideas in hand , need mentoring			2

funding is currently a big issue			0
investors do n't take the technologists seriously , say the entrepreneurs			0
whilst their intentions and ideas are good , many of the entrepreneurs that i meet need to be mentored intensively			0
investors do n't have time for this			0
@entity5 policy makers need to seriously invest in creating more business schools and put the right infrastructures into place to save the private sector industry of @entity5 and youth of @entity5			0
technology hubs and innovative spaces are addressing these current needs			0
the @entity0 winners now need to scale up their business models ; this means they will need more funding , mentoring and manpower			1
to respond to this growing need , i have launched @entity172 @ spot1mentoring , a new social enterprise initiative committed to supporting , guiding , unlocking the potential of the growing numbers of bedroom entrepreneurs in @entity5			2
with its official launch in the summer , it 's an initiative i hope can help @entity5 's innovators to scale up and become profitable .			2

the competition has shown that @entity5 has a growing number of innovators
but the challenge is to turn the apps into lucrative business ideas , says @entity193
