-- this time it 'll be @entity2 who laughs last and loudest			1
for months he 's been ribbed by his pals for dozing off during a visit to a school arranged through the @entity7 , creating a phenomenon that became internationally known as " @entity9			1
" the 36 - year - old captured his maiden major title at the @entity12 at @entity13 in @entity14 on sunday , two years after his heartbreaking playoff defeat to @entity16			1
and do n't be surprised if the @entity18 resident does another spot of " @entity20 " this week , this time with a major difference -- the @entity12 will be by his side			1
" i checked out there , " @entity2 told @entity0 of the moment when he fell asleep on a trip to @entity25 that was subsequently recreated by @entity16 , @entity26 and @entity27 to name but a few			1
" that 's the only time i did it , actually i did it once with @entity32 because she asked me			0
" they caught me in a moment of relaxation and then the guys out here tried to give me a good ribbing on it and tried to get me in trouble			0
" i ran with it and it turned out to be a good thing and a lot of people have taken to it so maybe i 'll give them a special treat when i get home later this week with the trophy			2
" @entity2 has become a cult figure on @entity7 due to his " moment of relaxation " but also because of his incredibly laid back demeanor			1
his mood barely seems to flicker away from calm and composed -- some people criticizing him for a lack of emotion -- and during his charge to the title he was still seen chewing tobacco			2
@entity2 says his climb to the pinnacle of the game has kept him grounded and that his new found success wo n't alter him			1
" a lot of things are going to change in my life because of this but i do n't think it 's going to change me one bit , " he explained			1
" that 's just who i am , the way my parents raised me , that 's the way i 've been since day one			0
" no matter what success i 've had i 've always had a lot of the same friends , the people that have been with me through college and through the mini tours			2
" i 've had the same caddy for 12 years which is pretty darn though out here			0
those are the type of relationships i build and that 's the type of guy i am			0
" that it was the @entity12 crown that helped him break his major duck was fitting			1
two years ago @entity2 blew a five - shot lead over @entity16 , eventually losing to his @entity96 @entity95 teammate in a playoff			1
but after he fired a final round of 68 to finish on 10 - under @entity16 was one of the first to congratulate him , having raced back from the airport to toast his friend 's victory			1
" it made me hungrier actually to be so close and lose it like i did , " @entity2 said of his near miss at the @entity104 in 2011			2
" i was able to learn from all the mistakes i made , learn from that experience and put it all together this week			0
" unfortunately when i did lose i was a little disappointed but i think it helped me in the long run			0
" it 's tough because you 're not sure what happened or did i really do this but to be in the company of people who 've won majors now and to have my name on the @entity120 -- unbelievable feeling			0
" @entity2 's triumph marks the end of an arduous 13 - year rise to the top of the game			1
after turning professional in 2000 he flitted between the @entity7 and its feeder competition , the @entity129			0
he 's remained his usual unflappable self throughout his journey and has gone from strength to strength since cementing his spot on the @entity7 in 2009			2
" it 's always been a struggle for me , " @entity2 explained			2
" i felt like i was talented but i went through the ranks , whether it be junior golf , college golf , mini tour , early pro golf it was a struggle			0
" there were moments of greatness followed by a lot of disappointment and frustration and question marks but the last couple years i 've really solidified my spot out here on the @entity7			0
" now i 'm getting more comfortable trying to win these tournaments			0

@entity2 **celebrate*s* his first ever major title with success at @entity12

the 36 - year - old was teased by fellow pros for falling asleep on a school visit in @entity25
@entity2 *insists* his first major victory wo n't change him one bit as a person
