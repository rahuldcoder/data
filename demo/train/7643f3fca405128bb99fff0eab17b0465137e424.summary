-- what happens when you give a 2 - year - old a camera ? for @entity7 toddler @entity6 , his imagination runs wild in a good way			1
portrait and wedding photographer @entity10 has been @entity6 's nanny for the past year and a half			1
one day , during a visit to the park , they were sitting in a sandbox and @entity6 leaned over a toy dump truck			1
' " take a photo of me like this , " @entity10 recalls him saying			1
then he asked her to mimic his pose and let him take her photo			1
she showed him how to hold her @entity23 and push the shutter button			0
the results were delightful , if not a little blurry			0
@entity10 started compiling the images on her website in a photos series @entity30 that 's catching the attention of blogs and local media			1
@entity10 has been photographing @entity6 since she became his nanny , so his mother was n't surprised to see him show an interest in getting behind the camera			1
" the irony is that he wo n't sit still to take a picture for me , " @entity39 said			1
@entity43 thinks the project teaches her son observation skills and inspires him to be creative			0
" he 's learning to see the world through a different lens			2
i think he 's aware of his surroundings more through this project , " @entity48 said			2
@entity10 has also learned a thing or two from the project , which continues on her site			1
she shared with @entity0 some wisdom and tips for teaching children photography skills			0
the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			0
@entity0 : what are some of @entity6 's interests ? @entity10 : he loves dinosaurs			1
we go to the museum a lot			0
the aquarium ; he loves underwater life			0
he loves trucks , trains and building ramps			0
he 's a really hands - on , energetic kid			1
@entity0 : i 'm amazed these are all shot with an @entity23			0
@entity10 : with the @entity23 , doing indoor shots with him is tough			1
i 'm trying to teach him how to focus , but he does n't quite get that			0
some of the photos are blurry and not quite right			0
i do n't know if i 'd be able to do this if it were a real camera			0
but because it 's an @entity23 , it 's so light and small enough for his tiny little hands to hold			2
he can hold it and slide his thumb over to take a photo			2
@entity0 : how many times does it take to get a picture before turns out ? @entity10 : sometimes he gets it on the first go			1
sometimes it takes three or four times			0
usually i get in a pose , then he takes the photo , then i have to take a look to see if he got the shot			1
if he did n't get it , i 'll get back in the pose and we 'll try again			2
sometimes he only gets my legs in it , or my head and sometimes his thumb is over it			0
@entity0 : what has @entity6 learned in doing this project with you ? @entity10 : i do n't know if he 's learned anything really , but he 's taking interest in taking photos of other things in the location that we 're in			1
i think it 's starting to bring out an interest in photography			2
i do n't know if he 'll grow up to be a photographer , but i think he 'll definitely do something creative			2
@entity0 : what are your tips for other parents or people who want to try having their kids take photos ? @entity10 : if they show an interest in it , and you feel comfortable and safe with them using the camera or phone , teach them the basic skills , like this is the button to push			1
when you see what you like in the screen , tap the icon			0
i think it 's more about getting them to have an interest in photography and having them interested in seeing things with a photographic eye			2
be game for what they throw at you			0
you just have to be ready for whatever they throw at you			2
be ready to laugh at yourself and make a fool out of yourself			1
@entity0 : what has @entity6 taught you through this project ? @entity10 : the poses he chooses , i would never make my clients do that			1
more than anything it 's just brought me a lot of happiness			2
there 's really no age limit to photography and creativity			0
if you have a creative mind at such a young age , then just embrace it and try to bring it out			0
just let him do his thing			0
he 's starting to get really smart with this			0
i was getting him ready for his nap and he said , " how about before nap time we do seven different poses ? " he 's using the posing as a way to stall things that he just really does n't want to do			1
