-- praise the @entity1 and pass the ammunition : the blogosphere is roiling with conspiracy theories over a @entity6 shopping list for 174,000 hollow - point bullets			1
depending on whom you believe , police who protect @entity6 officers are either preparing for impending financial doom by purchasing lethal ammo to put down rioting citizens , or they 're just making a standard purchase of ammunition for a federal police agency			1
it all began last month when the agency , which is primarily responsible for distributing benefits to the disabled and retired people , posted an announcement seeking bids for 174,000 hollow - point bullets			1
why ? cried some bloggers			0
@entity26 , a website operated by right - wing talk show host @entity28 , wanted to know if the agency was preparing for " civil unrest			1
" " @entity6 welfare is estimated to keep around 40 per cent of senior citizens out of poverty			2
should the tap run dry in the aftermath of an economic collapse which the @entity39 has already told top banks to prepare for , domestic disorder could ensue if people are refused their benefits , " it said in a post			0
each bullet potentially " represents a dead @entity46 , " wrote retired maj. gen. @entity44 , an @entity45 vet			0
" if so , why would the @entity46 government want the @entity6 to kill 174,000 of our citizens , even during a time of civil unrest ? " @entity44 wrote on the conservative website @entity54 , founded by commentator @entity55			1
conspiracy theorists had previously speculated that a purchase of hollow - point bullets by the @entity59 was similarly meant to quell impending riots			1
a few years ago , theorists similarly questioned why the @entity62 was stockpiling body bags and other supplies , suggesting the agency was preparing for civil collapse			2
in the face of the furor , the @entity6 's public affairs shop -- which spends most of its time issuing releases about speeding disability decisions or looking up benefits information -- issued a statement explaining that its 295 agents need the bullets for target practice and to protect the agency 's 66 offices across the nation			1
" these investigators have full law enforcement authority , including executing search warrants and making arrests , " the agency said in an august post			1
" our investigators are similar to your state or local police officers			2
they use traditional investigative techniques , and they are armed when on official duty			0
" hollow point bullets are standard - issue items for many police agencies , the @entity6 said			1
the bullets expand when they hit a target and can help prevent injuries to bystanders from bullets passing through a body , according to police			2
investigators " use this ammunition during their mandatory quarterly firearms qualifications and other training sessions , to ensure agent and public safety , " the administration added			0
this is just the latest in a long history of uniquely @entity46 anti-government conspiracy theories , said @entity114 , a @entity116 history professor and author of " @entity118 : conspiracy theories in @entity120			0
" that another one would surface in the midst of a contentious election cycle and continued unease over the nation 's financial future is not all that surprising , @entity114 said tuesday			2
but this one , she said , seems particularly tenuous			0
" it strikes me as one of the more extreme conspiracy theories , " @entity114 said			0
" i 'm surprised it has any traction			0
" you do n't use hollow point bullets for target practice , " one @entity134 user posted tuesday			1
" sorry we 're not buying it social security agency			0
" by the numbers : @entity6			0

some question the @entity6 's recent bid request for 174,000 hollow - point bullets
bloggers say the agency 's police force is preparing for financial collapse and civil unrest
the agency *characterizes* the order as routine and says special agents need them
" these investigators have full law enforcement authority , " the agency says
