" diminished capacity relates to a person 's ability or inability " to make adequately considered decisions " regarding his or her legal representation because of " mental impairment or for some other reason , " the @entity63 says			2

the bar association adds " that care should be taken not to confuse such mental disease or defect with moral obliquity , mental depravity , or passion growing out of anger , revenge , hatred , or other motives and kindred evil conditions , for , when the act is induced by any of these causes , the person is accountable to the law			0

that does n't make him crazy , " @entity102 said			0
added @entity120 , cousin of @entity121 , also killed in the theater : " it was complete planning			0
it was everything on his part to make sure that this act was carried out from start to finish			0

a container of glycerin hung above a frying pan with a potassium mixture , attached to a trip wire that would tip the glycerin into the pan , @entity205 testified			0
had it been triggered , @entity205 said , it would have set off an explosion and fire , igniting jars of homemade napalm spiked with bullets and thermite -- a metallic substance that burns so hot it is nearly impossible to extinguish			0
in a twist that seems ripped from the pages of a comic book , @entity5 also rigged his computer and a boom box placed outside to begin playing loud music after he set out for the theater -- apparently in hopes that the noise would prompt someone to investigate and trigger the explosives , witnesses said			1
next to the boom box outside his apartment , @entity205 testified , @entity5 said he placed a toy car and a device that looked like it would control the car but would instead have set off the explosives			1

witnesses who have spoken to @entity0 about the shooting have said the gunman roamed the theater , shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats			1
@entity10 survivors : how they 're doing among the 41 calls to 911 , one stands out			1
in the 27 - second call , at least 30 shots can be heard amid the chaos			0
at some point , according to @entity295 , one of @entity5 ' weapons jammed			1
" had the @entity299 not jammed , he would have killed more people , " she said			2
investigators found 76 shell casings in the auditorium			0
most of the spent rounds -- 65 -- were .223 caliber rifle rounds , six were shotgun shells and five were .40 caliber rounds from the @entity310 , @entity181 said			0

police would cut off the body armor he wore and learn about the explosive booby - trap at his home			0
the interrogation police described a strange scene in the interrogation room -- @entity5 sitting in his underwear , t - shirt and white socks after police had cut away his body armor -- making puppets of the paper bags officers had placed over his hands to preserve gunpowder evidence , according to @entity181			2
@entity5 played with his polystyrene drinking cup as if it were a piece in a game			2
