@entity0 was a 23 - year - old computer science student when his girlfriend 's roommate , @entity3 , was found dead in the house she shared with @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , in 2007			1
the discovery was the beginning of what @entity0 has called " a nightmare " he would n't wish on anyone			1
in 2009 , he and @entity13 were convicted of @entity15 's murder			1
in 2011 , the pair were acquitted -- only to have that decision overturned by @entity7 @entity19 judges two years later			1
a retrial began in @entity21 in september 2013			1
the initial guilty verdict at the 2009 trial had not been the result @entity0 had been expecting			1
" when the sentencing was read , i did n't understand what was happening and even now it seems impossible and still i do n't understand why i was convicted , " he said in a prison interview through his lawyer the week after the sentencing			2
he said then he dreamed of returning to his studies			2
@entity0 is from @entity32 , on the @entity34 coast , far south of the central @entity7 university town where he was studying			1
in his prison interview , he said he missed the smell of the sea , among other things			2
" above all my family , " he said in the interview conducted via attorney @entity41			2
" i also miss my friends , the everyday life , the walks in my town 's square			2
" @entity0 finished his computer science degree while in prison , according to media reports			1
he was not studying at the same university as @entity13 , and was not held in the same prison			0
in the prison interview , he described how the verdict brought the world collapsing down on him and @entity13			0
but he denied then that he was still in love with her , saying , " i feel close to her because i consider her my companion in misadventure			0
" he rejected the idea that @entity13 was capable of murder			2
" i do n't even dare think a thing like that			0
it is absurd and inadmissible			0
she is a very sweet girl , " he insisted			0
when their successful appeal saw @entity13 and @entity0 freed in 2011 -- after four years in prison -- they set about trying to rebuild their lives , a continent apart			1
@entity0 had hoped simply to blend in in his hometown of @entity32			1
" i only hope to be forgotten ; the sooner the better			0
i want to have a normal life , " he said before his release			0
" i do n't want to be recognized when i leave the prison			0
" ' journey to hell ' @entity0 published a book in 2012 , the first by someone directly involved in the chain of events sparked by the discovery of @entity15 's body			1
the memoir , " @entity88 : my journey to @entity97 with @entity5 , " draws heavily on diaries he kept and letters he wrote to friends , family and his hometown newspaper during his years in prison , the preface says			1
@entity0 chronicles the day of the murder , admitting that he and @entity13 smoked marijuana that afternoon , which he says he regretted because it clouded his memory of what happened			1
while maintaining his innocence , he says he does not clearly remember even if @entity13 spent the night with him			0
he and @entity13 made mistakes the morning of the discovery , including trusting police investigators , he writes			0
@entity0 acknowledges that at times , he was uncomfortable with @entity13 's " bizarre behavior , " which he says prosecutors used against both of them			1
in the epilogue , he recounts how he went to visit @entity13 in @entity112 after their release , but he was nervous to see her			0
" i was n't at all sure it was a good idea and i continued to waver back and forth even after i booked my ticket			0
" we had been through so much ; perhaps we owed it to each other to live our lives and leave each other in peace			0
" rather than that hoped - for peace , @entity0 's nightmare began again following the 2013 ruling of the @entity19 judges in @entity128 that there should be a retrial			1
in an interview with @entity132 soon after the retrial opened in september 2013 , @entity0 maintained his innocence			1
" i just think that in the @entity7 system , there 's something really wrong in the rules that they sometimes are not respected or they are turned to hurt people			2
and they can hurt actually innocent people , " he said			0
" my life now is a hell			0
" @entity0 took the stand to defend himself in november			2
" i would like to make you understand that these charges against me are absurd , " he told the court			0
" there was not a basis to charge me , to put me in jail ... i do n't wish anybody on @entity153 to go through what i went through			0
" he said that evidence against him -- a knife that was a key part of the prosecution 's case -- was " an illusion			2
" " i ask you ... to really look at reality , " he implored the judges			0
" for me , it 's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination ... " right now , i do n't have a real life			1
