-- for the second time in five months , @entity2 's treasured collection of ancient manuscripts is under threat			1
earlier this year , it was thought that most of the 300,000 precious documents were destroyed by @entity8 fundamentalists when the northern @entity10 conflict entered the fabled city			1
but as it turns out , only 4,000 documents were burned by the rebels			0
the rest were smuggled out of @entity2 six months before the incursion by a team of local families who have long safeguarded their city 's famous library , often in their own homes			2
the evacuation of the @entity2 manuscripts was led by local librarian @entity25 and @entity26 based book preservation expert @entity28 , who recruited local citizens and couriers to help them move more than 1,000 trunks of manuscripts by donkey cart , bicycle and boats to a safe house in the south of @entity10			1
despite the dangers of the mission , both to the treasured texts and those involved in the evacuation , the vast majority of the manuscripts were saved , only to face a new threat			2
new : new fears for @entity2 in @entity10 conflict the climate in the south of @entity10 is more humid than in @entity2 and the fragile rag paper texts are now showing signs of mildew and rot			1
" it would be the ultimate irony if all of these had survived the evacuation but had been destroyed because we do n't have the resources to archival box them and insert humidity traps for the period they are in exile , " said @entity28 , who has now started a campaign to raise the estimated $ 7 million it will cost to rescue the manuscripts			0
the threat has been compounded , she said , by the pending rainy season in @entity10 which usually begins in the middle of june			0
@entity72 , where the manuscripts are being held , has some of the country 's heaviest rain			0
@entity28 is now calling on the global community to join the fight to save what she describes as an irreplaceable collection which includes works of poetry , fiction , commerce , medical theory and religious thought			1
" our ultimate goal is to return them to their home in @entity2 , " said @entity28			0
but that wo n't happen , she said , unless the manuscripts can be protected now .			0
