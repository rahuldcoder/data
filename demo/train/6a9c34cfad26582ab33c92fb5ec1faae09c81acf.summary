-- summer movie season is @entity3 's prime time			1
over the past eight years , the writer / actor 's been a major player in some of the season 's biggest comedies , including 2005 's " @entity8 , " 2007 's " knocked up " and " @entity9 , " and 2008 's " @entity10			2
" this year , @entity3 is poised to continue his summer streak when " @entity12 " opens june 12			1
the comedy , which @entity3 co-wrote and co-directed with @entity14 , boasts a long list of a-list names , including some of @entity3 's regular co-stars like @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
as the trailer humorously illustrates , the plot is basically this : @entity3 brings his old friend @entity19 ( " knocked up " ; " @entity33 " ) along to a " giant party " at @entity18 's home , where the likes of @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 have gathered			1
suddenly , in the middle of the revelry , the partygoers step outside to find a world in the midst of an apocalypse			2
mayhem ensues , leaving @entity3 's team to their own devices in order to make it out alive			1
( at one point , the terror even includes an ax - wielding @entity46			2
) the conceit is that all of the stars are portraying " themselves " in the flick , either playing up the public 's perceptions about them or playing against type			1
" we wanted ( ' @entity12 ' ) to feel very real , " @entity3 said			1
" we liked the idea of us playing ourselves , because we thought it 's cool if the movie really takes place in the same world that the viewers of the movie live in			2
there 's no separation between your world as the audience and our world as the people in the movie			2
" but overall , especially for the main six at the center of the story -- @entity3 , @entity18 , @entity20 , @entity19 , @entity72 and @entity73 -- " no one 's anything like how they are in the movie in real life , " @entity3 said			1
" they 're all very nice , sweet people			2
in the movie , they 're all idiots			0
" by now an old pro at writing comedies , @entity3 feels confident that he and @entity14 have crafted at least an entertaining film			1
" i do n't know if it will be successful or not , but i 'm very proud of it			0
i think it 's funny , " @entity3 said			1
" i watched it with a lot of movie theaters full of people , and they genuinely seemed to really really get a kick out of it			0
it played as well as any of our movies , so i 'm like out of the woods in my head			0
whether or not it makes a ton of money , that 's honestly out of my hands completely , so i just focus on what i can control			0
" the actor , writer and now first - time director has come a long way since his high school days , when he dropped out to pursue his career			0
" i think i was fortunate in that i knew what i wanted to do , and no one has to give you permission , " @entity3 said			1
" like , you can just do comedy			1
no one has to give you permission to write a movie			0
if you have a computer , you can just write a movie			0
" he was also lucky to have parents who supported his decision and ambitions , driving him to comedy shows and encouraging him to write			1
" i worked really hard			0
it 's not like i dropped out of high school and just did nothing , " @entity3 said			1
" i dropped out of high school and went and worked on a tv show			0
we were writing a script all throughout high school			0
i probably worked harder than most people who were just doing high school stuff , honestly			0
i did stand - up comedy all throughout high school			2
i think , honestly , if you have a career in mind that is n't academically oriented , then high school is probably not going to lead you to what you want to be			0
