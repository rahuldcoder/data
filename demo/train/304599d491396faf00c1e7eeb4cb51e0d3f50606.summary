-- the computers have n't proven to be our trivia overlords just yet			0
give them at least until wednesday			0
an @entity6 supercomputer named @entity7 finished one round of the tv show " @entity10 ! " on monday night tied with one of his human competitors and $ 3,000 ahead of the other			1
the man vs. computer face - off wo n't be complete , however , until the final rounds of the extended trivia game show are aired on tuesday and wednesday			1
@entity6 trumpets @entity7 , which has been in development for years and has the processing power of 2,800 " powerful computers , " as a major advancement in machines ' efforts to understand human language			1
the computer receives clues through digital texts and then buzzes in against the two other " @entity10 ! " contestants like any other player would			1
it juggles dozens of lines of reasoning at once and tries to arrive at a smart answer			0
after getting off to a scary - good start , @entity7 did have a few stumbles			1
in one instance , it repeated an answer that another contestant , @entity42 , who won 74 " @entity10 ! " episodes in a row , had already tried			1
" what is 1920s ? " @entity7 said , sounding like a digitized @entity44			1
" no , " game - show host @entity45 replied			0
" on many other clues , however , @entity7 was spot - on			1
after losing the first clue to @entity50 , another " @entity10 ! " champion , @entity7 jumped in on the second question			1
clue : " @entity54 on the hoof of a horse or a card - dealing box in a casino			0
" @entity7 : " what is shoe ? " correct			2
at the start of the show , @entity45 went to some lengths to explain the origins of @entity7 -- @entity6 approached the show about the idea three years ago -- and how the computer actually works			1
that 's partly because what you see on the " jeopardy ! " stage is somewhat misleading			0
it looks as if two humans are bookending a simple computer monitor , which appears to be just about as smart as they are			0
in reality , as @entity45 explained , the bulk of @entity7 's computer power was stored in another building at an @entity6 lab in @entity81 , where the show is being held for this special three - day competition			1
@entity84 : will @entity6 's @entity7 put your job in jeopardy ? after introducing @entity7 , to studio applause , this is how @entity45 explained it : " just as i expected , " he said			1
" that was a very warm reception and i 'm sure @entity7 would have appreciated the applause			2
except for one thing : @entity7 can neither hear nor see			2
it will be receiving all of its information electronically			0
" and as a matter of fact what you 're looking at right now is not the real @entity7			2
this is a representation of @entity7			2
@entity7 , or course , is a sophisticated computer system too big and too heavy to fit behind that lectern on our stage			1
" as for the stage version of @entity7 , his brain - face was represented by a digital earth that swirled with ribbons of various colors while he thought about questions			1
as @entity45 read the clues , a bar graph appeared at the bottom of the screen , showing the top three answers @entity7 was considering at that moment and how confident he was in those choices			2
sometimes the computer managed to be confident but still incorrect			0
here 's the clue to the first question @entity7 got wrong : " from the @entity125 for end , this is where trains can also originate			2
" @entity7 : " what is finis			2
" confidence level : 97 %			0
@entity45 : " @entity42 ? " " what is terminus , " @entity42 answered correctly			0
before ending the evening tied with @entity50 at $ 5,000 each , @entity7 had jumped out to an early lead at the first commercial break			1
at that point , @entity7 had $ 5,200 and his closest noncomputer counterpart had only $ 1,000			2
several @entity138 users were awed by the computer 's smarts			0
" @entity7 kinda feakin ' me out			0
big time , " @entity142 , a tech analyst , wrote on his @entity138 feed			0
another person wrote : " @entity7 is almost scary			0
this is willld ! these humans are no match for @entity7 's algorithms			0
" @entity45 summed up the computer 's mixed performance this way : " so , what have we learned so far : @entity7 's very bright , very fast , but he had some weird little moments once in a while			1
" then he teased the upcoming shows : " and how many of those will we encounter tomorrow when we play double and final ' @entity10 ! ' ? "			0

@entity6 computer @entity7 finishes first round tied with 1 contestant , ahead of 2nd
@entity7 has the processing power of 2,800 " powerful computers "
