-- an architect who uses recycled building materials from historic buildings torn down to make way for @entity6 's megacities has won architecture 's most prestigious international award , the 2012 @entity9			1
@entity10 , 48 , whose @entity12 - based firm @entity11 has just four permanent staff , was widely regarded as a long shot to win the $ 100,000 prize that has previously been awarded to celebrity architects such as @entity17 and @entity18			1
" the fact that an architect from @entity6 has been selected by the jury to win the prize , represents a significant step in acknowledging the role that @entity6 will play in the development of architectural ideals , " said @entity19 , chairman of the @entity20 which sponsors the prize			1
unlike many of his contemporaries who studied overseas in the @entity32 and @entity33 , @entity10 trained in @entity6			1
he took the unusual step of taking on almost no commissions during the 1990s , instead learning about building materials by working closely with the kind of craftsmen normally shunned by office - bound architects			1
" for myself , being an artisan or a craftsman , is being an amateur or almost the same thing , " @entity10 said in a press release , using the word in its true meaning as one who does something for love rather than money			2
one of his most celebrated buildings , the @entity54 , used recycled materials collected from the nearby area to construct a modern building that paid homage to the past			1
" my belief is that architecture should work hand in hand with time , " said @entity10			1
" sometimes i prefer to use less costly materials that can be replaced when damaged			2
temporary , as i use the word , is not meant to mean disposable			0
" he says the design process is similar to that of the traditional @entity6 painter			2
he first studies the environment , looking at its orientation and geography			0
he then thinks about these things for a week without doing any designs			0
then -- as was the case with the @entity54 -- the design begins to take shape in his mind			0
" i design a house instead of a building , " he said			0
" one problem of professional architecture is that it thinks too much of a building			0
a house , which is close to our simple and daily life , is more fundamental than architecture			0
" the @entity89 judges praised @entity10 's ability to create architecture that is timeless , deeply rooted in its context and yet universal			1
one of the judges , @entity94 , a previous winner of the architecture prize , described @entity10 's work as " mature , " avoiding the " sensational and the novel			1
" " to look at the state of the profession , it would seem that anything is possible , and more often than not , we get anything ! " he said			0
despite his growing reputation , @entity10 still has to struggle to gain acceptance for his idiosyncratic designs			2
the first step , he says , is to convince the government and the client , the second step is to marry the construction materials to the plan , and the third is to get those who will use the building to accept it			0
" ( this last step is ) the hardest part of all , because the @entity6 often think of a building as just a container whose functions can change at will , ' he added			2
" i can have no influence on this third stage			0
