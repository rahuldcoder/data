ahead of a town hall meeting tuesday night , @entity1 's mayor said the aftermath of the shooting death of @entity5 helped open the eyes of city officials to the town 's racial divide			1
" i think what it showed was ... even though i always knew again that african - americans had experiences that were frustrating , definitely frustrating , many of that never bubbled to the surface			0
so i think what really opened my eyes was how significant that can be for many people , " mayor @entity16 said			2
police chief @entity21 echoed the mayor 's sentiment			1
" the things that have bubbled up since the shooting have really made us sit up and take notice and realize that there is a lot more work to be done , " @entity21 said			2
one of those things that need to be done is community outreach , @entity21 said ; it 's one of the steps that the police department and the local government need to take for @entity1 to be more cohesive			1
protests erupted last month after @entity1 officer @entity39 's fatal shooting of unarmed 18 - year - old @entity5			1
they devolved into nights of looting , vandalism and violence before the tenor of the protests eventually calmed			2
@entity21 has tried to reach out more to residents , sometimes going to the daily protests in the city streets			1
one of those trips did n't go well			0
after issuing an apology thursday , @entity21 went to dialogue with demonstrators , but not everyone was eager to hear from him			0
" if you are not resigning tonight , go home , " said one man on a bullhorn			0
it was shortly after @entity21 agreed to walk and talk with the demonstrators that a scuffle broke out somewhere behind the chief , and officers moved in to make arrests			1
there was no indication that @entity21 was threatened , but he was quickly escorted inside a building			0
for several hours , police officers stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the police department with protesters a short distance away , some milling about and others chanting			1
on tuesday , @entity21 said he 'll still go down to the protests			1
" i do n't think it 's ever a mistake for me to engage people are trying to talk to me and my police department and my city , " he said			1
" i think it 's important to keep those lines of communication open			0
so if some people want to turn it into a hostile situation , that 's their fault , not mine			0
but i wish it would have turned out better than it did			0
" the chief blamed outsiders for the trouble			0
last week , @entity21 said he would n't resign , and the mayor , who was re-elected in april , said tuesday that now is not the time for that kind of change			1
" we 're moving forward as a community			0
if we change up now , i do n't know that that is going to help us down the road , " he said			0
the town hall meeting , which is closed to the media , comes two nights after the most recent violent protests			1
protests come to the police station eight people were arrested outside the police department on sunday night when demonstrations grew violent again , police say			1
each was charged with failure to disperse and resisting arrest , lt. @entity115 of the @entity116 said			0
only one of those arrested was from @entity1 ; the others were from elsewhere in the @entity121 metropolitan area			2
three were from @entity121 , one was from @entity123 , one was from @entity124 , one was from @entity125 , and one was homeless , he said			0
last week , the burning of a memorial near the site where @entity5 was killed reignited the demonstrations			2
sunday night 's protests unfolded in front of the police station , about 2 miles from the five - lane drag that typically plays host to the demonstrations			1
although previous protests at the police station have been largely peaceful , some demonstrators among a crowd of about 150 people began throwing rocks and bottles at officers about 10 p.m. , according to @entity146 affiliate @entity145			2
the eight people arrested were taken to a nearby jail , booked and released , @entity145 reported .			0
