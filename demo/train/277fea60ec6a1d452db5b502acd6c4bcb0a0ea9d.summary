-- how on earth could a teenage swimmer at her first @entity2 knock five full seconds off her previous best performance ? that 's what has left so many people scratching their heads after watching @entity10 's @entity9 smash the world record in the women 's 400 - meter individual medley			1
the @entity10 swimming prodigy 's extraordinary swims during the first few days of the @entity16 may have drawn praise from across the sport , but they 've also raised suspicions of drug doping			2
the 16 - year - old world champion won gold tuesday in the women 's 200 - meter individual medley , three days after coming from behind to take one second off the world record -- and a whopping five seconds off her personal best -- during her gold medal swim in the 400 - meter individual medley			1
the controversy over her record tear through the final 50 meters of saturday 's golden swim -- faster than the final leg of @entity34 champion @entity33 's own gold medal performance -- began during the @entity36 's coverage of the race , when presenter @entity38 turned to her co-presenter , former @entity41 olympian @entity40 , and asked : " how many questions will be there , @entity40 , about someone who can suddenly swim much faster than she has ever swum before ? " @entity45 , the executive director of the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) and the @entity47 , called @entity9 's swim " disturbing " and told the @entity50 newspaper it brought back " a lot of awful memories " of doping scandals at previous @entity16			1
@entity55 spokesman @entity54 called doping allegations against @entity9 " sad " and " pure rumor , " and told @entity0 he had heard nothing from @entity16 drug testers to suggest that anything was awry			1
more : hi - tech tests to catch @entity2 drug cheats but while @entity9 's swimming has caused the most controversy in the first week of the @entity16 , the swimming prodigy herself is n't exactly an unknown quantity			2
born in the eastern @entity10 city of @entity69 , @entity9 began swimming at the age of six after her teacher noticed she had large hands and feet , according to @entity10 's @entity74 state news agency			1
after winning the 50 - meter freestyle swim in her peer group at the @entity78 in 2006 at the age of 10 , her coach predicted @entity9 would be an @entity2 champion			2
@entity9 joined the @entity81 provincial swimming team in 2007 and @entity10 's national team the year after			1
@entity9 arrived on the world stage in 2010 at the age of 14 , winning a pair of gold medals at the @entity87 and two silvers at the @entity89 in @entity90			2
on her @entity2 profile , @entity9 's most memorable sporting achievement is listed as " winning the 200m and 400m individual medley at the @entity95 in @entity96			1
" view : best hi res photos of @entity16 but it was n't until world champion @entity99 was banned in june 2012 for a positive drug test that @entity9 rose to the forefront of the @entity10 swimming team			2
@entity9 won gold in the 200 - meter individual medley at the 2011 @entity105 in @entity106 , but finished outside the top three in the 400 - meter individual medley			1
just one year later , @entity9 swam the race more than a second faster than any woman in history			0
@entity9 has attributed her success to her training schedule and hard work			0
" if the coach asks me to practice 10,000 meters , i would never be a lazy player to swim 9,900 meters instead , " the @entity116 quoted her as saying			0
but practicing hard and destroying the 400 - meter medley record by storming through the final 50 meters faster than anyone else , man or woman , are two very different things , and @entity9 's golden performance quickly raised suspicions of drug doping from @entity45 , one of the most respected names in the sport of swimming			1
" the one thing i will say is that history in our sport will tell you that every time we see something , and i will put quotation marks around this , ' unbelievable ' , history shows us that it turns out later on there was doping involved , " said @entity45 , who is also the executive director of the @entity130			2
@entity142 sport scientist @entity141 expressed concern on his science of @entity146 blog about the vast difference between the relatively average times @entity9 swam in the first three legs of the 400 meter race and her faster swim through the final 100 meters			0
" the conclusion that i would draw from this is that her 100m freestyle leg is disproportionately fast not only by comparison to @entity33 , but also to her peers , and to the best 100m freestyle swimmers , " @entity141 wrote			0
@entity157 chairman @entity156 joined @entity10 's anti-doping chief in defending @entity9 , saying @entity2 drug testing was " on top of the game			1
" " she 's been through ( anti-doping agency ) @entity164 's programme and she 's clean			0
that 's the end of the story , " he told reporters at a tuesday news conference			0
more : visit @entity0 's @entity2 center here @entity9 has denied doping allegations , saying , " my achievements derive from diligence and hard work , i will never use drugs			1
" @entity9 , along with many of her teammates , reportedly spent months training in @entity180 before the @entity16 , and @entity10 's approach appears to be paying off			1
@entity182 won @entity10 's first ever men 's gold medal in swimming in the 400 - meter freestyle final just 25 minutes before @entity9 's record swim last saturday , and the @entity10 swim team has also netted several other swimming medals			1
no one seemed more surprised about the outcome of the race than @entity9 herself , who said : " i dreamed of winning the gold medal , but i never ever expected to break a world record , i 'm overwhelmed			1
" the head of @entity10 's swimming team , @entity196 , wondered aloud why similar allegations have n't dogged other top swimmers in recent years			2
" @entity201 was called a genius , @entity200 got eight gold medals in @entity204			0
@entity33 , @entity205 are both recognised as geniuses			0
there were geniuses in @entity209 and @entity142			0
we admit and accept these geniuses , but why ca n't a genius come from @entity10 , a country with a large population ? " one person who does n't seem in doubt is @entity33 himself			0
he said : " it was pretty impressive			0
and it was a female			0
if she was there with me , i do n't know , she might have beat me			0
