the politics of health care is changing fast			1
president @entity3 's @entity2 was vulnerable during his first term when @entity5 demanded repeal of the law			1
even after the @entity9 upheld its constitutionality , there were still many voices who objected to it			0
however , with each passing day , it appears that the program is in good shape , slowly becoming part of the fabric of @entity20 government			0
last week , @entity22 gov. @entity21 , one of the main potential contenders for the @entity5 presidential nomination in 2012 , said that his state would accept the @entity27 expansion that is part of the @entity2			1
@entity21 had been one of the president 's toughest critics , frequently lambasting the program as a prime example of big government liberalism			1
but he has changed his tune			0
the expansion of @entity27 will allow about 104,000 of the poorest residents in @entity22 to gain access to health insurance			2
@entity21 said : " let me be clear : i am no fan of the @entity2			1
i think it is wrong for @entity22 and for @entity20			0
i fought against it and believe , in the long run , it will not achieve what it promises			0
however , it is now the law of the land			0
i will make all my judgments as governor based on what is best for @entity49			0
" @entity21 's announcement comes on top of an even more dramatic reversal , that of @entity54 's gov. @entity53			2
the former health industry executive , who was elected to lead the @entity54 in 2010 , has been one of the more conservative voices in the @entity5			2
@entity53 , who once warned that " @entity2 will result in the rationing of health care , significant tax increases , significant job losses and the inability of many @entity20 to keep their existing health insurance " also announced that @entity54 would accept the new medicaid funds			1
" when the federal government is committed to paying 100 % of the cost , " @entity53 said , " i can not , in good conscience , deny @entity68 that need access to health care			1
" fewer republicans are interested in fighting against the @entity2 any more			1
not only is it a losing issue , but in the next few years , the benefits are going to start rolling in and more @entity20 will come to depend on the protections			0
the shift in position by two of the most prominent @entity5 suggests that the political dynamics are shifting , as @entity3 's supporters had always hoped			1
@entity5 officials now see powerful incentives for them to embrace the law rather than oppose it			0
the biggest watershed moment for the @entity2 came in june 2012 when the @entity9 ruled that the health care legislation was constitutional			1
like in 1937 , when the @entity9 declared that the social security tax was constitutional , the court 's ruling on health care gave @entity3 's program a legitimacy that undercut some of the thunder coming from the right			1
the @entity2 became law of the land			1
then the 2012 presidential election was an affirmation of popular support for @entity3 and the policies for which he fought			1
it 's not unusual for a big piece of legislation to elicit strong oppositions at first			2
with @entity104 , the program experienced over a decade of uncertainty			0
a means tested program for the elderly proved much more popular during the 1940s , and @entity109 refused to raise @entity104 taxes during @entity111 but by the early 1950s , @entity104 emerged as the primary means of helping the elderly			0
as more @entity20 were receiving their checks , fewer politicians in either party opposed the program			0
president @entity118 concluded that the @entity5 had little choice but to accept the program			2
republicans and @entity122 , including @entity123 , voted to increase benefits every two years			2
by the 1980s , @entity104 would be considered to be the " third rail " in @entity20 politics -- touch the benefits and you die			2
similarly , the @entity129 experienced strong reactions			0
the notion of prohibiting racial segregation was incredibly contentious			0
but once @entity109 passed it , @entity134 politicians , citizens and institutions quickly fell in line			0
in the 1970s and 1980s , issues such as affirmative action and school busing still riled up many , but de jure racial segregation was no longer considered acceptable by most			0
more recently , during president @entity145 's presidency , the new counterterrorism programs provoked heated debates			1
@entity122 railed against the tough interrogation techniques used by the government to combat terrorism and highlighted institutions such as @entity151 as symbols of what the nation was doing wrong			0
but @entity3 abandoned many of his plans to dismantle these programs			1
his nomination of @entity159 to head the @entity160 and the protection of key documents that allegedly support the assassination of @entity20 citizens reveal how much the tide has turned			2
today , there is considerable evidence that the health care law is approaching that turning point			1
as @entity182 wrote in the @entity183 , " so long as @entity2 is accepted as the law of the land , and repeal is dismissed by most @entity5 as little more than a pleasant fantasy , then a constructive process can begin in which @entity5 seize on problems with the law as an opportunity to reform the reforms -- and through that process , begin to buy into the new system			2
" there is still a lot of work that needs to be done , such as making sure that the health care exchanges work and that funding for the program remains adequate			1
the program 's success is not inevitable			0
but the recent change of heart from the darlings of the @entity5 is an indication the @entity2 is much further along to becoming one of the most important legacies of the @entity3 presidency .			1

@entity200 : the politics of health care is changing fast
@entity200 : president @entity3 's @entity2 is gaining more support
he says two of the most prominent republicans have switched to support the @entity2
@entity200 : the @entity2 is on its way to becoming an important legacy of the @entity3 presidency
