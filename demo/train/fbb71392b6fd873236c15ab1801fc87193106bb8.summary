-- early each morning , millions of farmers around the world rise to toil in their fields			2
by night , gangs of mobsters scheme and legions of poker players shuffle up and deal			0
sure , none of it 's real			0
but the overwhelming popularity of so - called social gaming -- simple games that let people play with their friends on networking sites such as @entity17 -- is changing the face of video games , experts say			1
and as the maker of popular titles like @entity23 and @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 - based @entity20 has ridden the games ' skyrocketing popularity to the top of that emerging market			1
for @entity20 founder @entity35 , the formula for gaming success on @entity17 , @entity33 and other sites was as simple as it might seem counterintuitive : create simple games that people like but can easily set aside			1
" we built the games so they could be played in a tab on your browser while you 're on a conference call , " said @entity35 , a veteran web entrepreneur who created @entity20 in 2007			1
of course , they 've been helped by the massive growth of @entity17 , where the games are so popular they 've spawned " fan " pages devoted to complaining about having to watch friends play them			1
@entity17 , with its 400 million users , is where the vast majority of people play @entity23 and @entity24 along with other @entity20 titles like @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
in all , more than 65 million people play @entity20 games every day , according to media tracking company @entity63			1
@entity20 's top title , @entity23 , is played by an estimated 75 million people each month -- roughly equal to the number who have played the classic arcade and desktop game @entity70 during its entire existence			1
the massive growth was satisfying but not altogether surprising to @entity35 , whose previous startups had included @entity74 , a web - based information - gathering service ; tech - support company @entity76 ; and @entity77 , an early social networking site from 2003			2
he said that starting the game company , which he named after his late @entity83 bulldog , was an effort to fill what he considered a surprising void in most people 's daily internet use			0
" i thought in 2007 that something had gone oddly wrong with the whole @entity88 experience , " @entity35 said			0
" i would have thought games would have been one of the top two or three experiences people had on the @entity88			2
" what @entity35 got right , according to gaming expert @entity98 , was a sort of return to the " golden era " of games like pac - man and @entity104 " video games actually appealed to a huge cross-section			1
they appealed to everybody , " said @entity98 , publisher of @entity107			0
" what happened is , as we went through the mid- ' 80s to the mid- 2000s , you started to see gaming become more incestuous in terms of 18 - to 34 - year - old males making games for people just like them			1
" by contrast , three of @entity20 's top five games -- @entity23 , @entity57 and @entity55 -- have mostly female players , with many players outside the traditional 18 - to 34 - year - old range			1
those games all operate on the same basic premise			2
starting with a simple farm , fish tank or restaurant , the player works to make it bigger and fancier , sharing items with friends and helping each other along the way			0
some of @entity20 's early titles simply mirrored existing board and card games			1
it was @entity24 -- in which players team up to whack other gangs -- that first exhibited what would become the hallmarks of social gaming : simple , single - player action that 's enhanced by teamwork			1
with @entity23 , that formula would become complete			1
players plant virtual crops that can be harvested hours , or days , later			0
along the way , they invite online friends to become their neighbors and help each other by sending gifts or helping with the farming			0
there 's no way to " win , " but players take satisfaction in building big , fancy farms that they can showcase to their friends			0
" a farm is something that is internationally understood and known			0
it 's cross-cultural , cross-gender , cross-age , " @entity35 said			0
" a great social game should be like a great cocktail party			2
if you want it to appeal to absolutely everyone you invite , it has to be broad in its content so that everyone gets it			0
" not that @entity20 's success has come without criticism			1
with hundreds of smaller companies vying for a piece of the social gaming market , some rivals have accused @entity20 of using its hefty venture capital to crowd out less - financed competitors			1
many of its most popular games , including @entity23 , are similar to pre-existing games from smaller companies , a fact @entity35 dismisses by noting that video games have always fallen into genres with similar titles from competing companies			1
@entity194 , the makers of @entity195 , filed a lawsuit claiming that @entity24 ripped them off			1
@entity20 settled that case in august , said a spokeswoman for the company			1
@entity20 also was hit with complaints and lawsuits over its original business model , which let players earn in - game rewards for things like signing up for a credit card or video - rental membership			1
critics said some of the offers amounted to scams , leading players to download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for memberships that appeared stealthily on their phone bills			0
@entity35 has acknowledged not being vigilant enough with the automated ads that appeared on @entity20 games during the company 's early days			1
" we were playing whack - a - mole , " @entity35 said			0
" every time we found one of these or got a complaint , we would take them down			0
eventually ... we realized we had to take a much more aggressive stance than a normal web site			0
" in november , @entity20 removed all " lead - generating " ads , relying for revenue instead on the roughly 1 to 3 percent of the player base that pays for in - game items , such as a barn in @entity23			1
it has since been putting the advertisements back in , with a new system that lets it more closely monitor what kind of ads show up , @entity35 said			0
" we 'll see where this goes for the entire industry , " @entity35 said			0
" it was really important to us to maintain a trusted position with our users			0
we wanted to do the right thing , and i think we did			0
" @entity35 offers a ray of hope for another vocal group of critics : the social - media users who say they 're tired of seeing all of their friends ' updates about @entity20 and other social games			1
on @entity17 , a group called " i dont care about your farm , or your fish , or your park , or your mafia ! ! ! " had more than 5.2 million members recently			1
no more of this stuff , " wrote one member			0
" i 've had all i can take			0
about to hang up @entity17			2
just want a nice cozy place to talk with my friends ! " @entity35 said he hopes that messages from games can eventually be targeted to a more select audience			2
" we have to evolve , " @entity35 said " i think it 's heading to a place that 's more narrow - casting			0
i think you 'll get to a place where @entity17 will be better about showing feeds to people who have a registered interest in them			2
" for example , he said , there might eventually be a way to send game notifications only to people who play social games themselves			2
" it 's not just games			2
it 's going to be true for music , for pictures , for status updates , " @entity35 said			0
" i think , over time , these networks are going to start to shape more to ... your [ registered interests ]			0
" meanwhile , @entity20 will be among the developers continuing to change how people look at video gaming			1
it 's a change that @entity98 , the gaming guru , says will be for the better			2
while heavyweights like @entity295 and the popular civilization series are making inroads into social gaming , @entity98 said , the genre is also opening up opportunities for smaller developers			1
" we 're seeing , in many ways , a second renaissance for games , " @entity98 said			2
" there 's been an epiphany among the developer community saying , ' look at these millions of users that we 've forgotten to speak to for years			2
' this can only be a good thing for the gaming industry in the end			0
