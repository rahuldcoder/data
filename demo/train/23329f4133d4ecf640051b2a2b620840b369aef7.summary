-- a black bear early monday chased a family dog into its central @entity4 home , where it attacked a husband and wife inside , according to the state game commission and one of the victims			1
@entity10 told @entity0 that he woke up -- as usual -- at 3 a.m. monday to get ready for work and let out the dog , @entity13 , a husky and pit bull mix. the dog sped off outside into the dark woods around the family home in rural @entity19 , then began to bark and growl			1
" it was a mean type of bark , a growl , i just thought , ' something is n't right , ' " @entity21 said			0
@entity21 got a spotlight to see what was going on			0
as he shined the light into the morning mist , @entity13 suddenly came running back toward the house -- followed , closely behind , by a black bear			1
the bear chased the dog into the house , where @entity21 said it attacked him			1
the melee woke @entity21 's wife @entity37 , who came down from any upstairs bedroom to help her husband			1
then , the bear turned on @entity21			1
when it did , @entity13 jumped on the bear			1
at that point , @entity10 said he rejoined the fray			2
" what are you going to do ? i kept my head down and just leapt into the bear , " he said			2
according to @entity21 , the bear became especially aggressive -- grabbing and biting him , as well as clawing at his back and head			2
that was until , suddenly , the bear walked outside to the patio and simply sat down			1
" if it had wanted to kill me i think it had have gone ahead and done it , " said @entity21			0
" i guess ( the bear ) was just ticked off at the dog and came after me " state police eventually arrived on the scene along with ambulances , which took the @entity58 to @entity59			1
by then , the bear had left			2
@entity21 was bitten several times and was treated for a cracked vertebra , according to her husband			2
he added that doctors put in 37 staples extending from one side of the back of his head to the other , in addition to puncture wounds from the bear 's claws and teeth			2
despite those injuries , by day 's end both husband and wife had left the hospital and were home			1
there , they reunited with their 10 - year - old son , who missed the ordeal			0
" he 's a heavy sleeper , i guess , " said @entity10			0
@entity88 spokesman @entity87 said that black bears are not rare sight in and around @entity91 , which he described as " very rural			2
" " to give you an idea , there is one stoplight , and when that happened it was a big shock , " he said			0
but it 's not often that they attack , said @entity87 , claiming that black bears " are more timid " than others elsewhere , including in the western @entity100			0
" usually a bear would be more likely to run from a person or a dog than confront a person or a dog , " he continued			1
" the root cause of most bear encounters in @entity4 have been dogs , but usually if a bear smells human scent they 'll tuck tail and run			0
" @entity87 said that the @entity88 suspects that the @entity19 attack was a special circumstance , suspecting that it was likely a female attempting to defend her cubs			1
he also said there is a " remote chance " that the bear may have rabies			0
@entity87 said that a @entity88 officer is out in the area setting traps but , as of late monday afternoon , the bear remained at large			1
the only way to test an animal for rabies is after it is dead , meaning that -- if caught -- the bear would likely be killed			0
" public health and safety is our main concern , " he said			0
" if caught , the animal will probably be put down			0
" as to family it attacked , @entity10 said matter - of - factly , " we 're going to be ok			0
" " what are the chances ? " he added			0
" i ca n't win the lottery , but i can get attacked by a bear			1
