-- to claim fans have been eagerly waiting for @entity4 author @entity3 's next book would be an understatement			1
@entity3 took the literary world by storm with " @entity8 , " a story about the life of " poor lovable " ghetto nerd @entity11 , narrated by @entity13 , the main protagonist in @entity3 's first novel , " @entity15			1
" the story of a chubby @entity4 boy growing up in @entity18 won a @entity19 in 2008 , @entity20 , and was named @entity23 's no. 1 @entity21 of 2007			1
now , in " @entity31 , " a collection of stories released last week , @entity3 brings back the character of @entity13 to tell the " important and necessary story of the inner lives of ' bad boys , ' " as the acclaimed author says			1
born in @entity34 and raised in @entity18 , the @entity33 alum took some time out of his book tour to talk about his new book , what his family thinks of his writing and the unique voice in his work			2
@entity0 : was it difficult to write " this is how you lose her , " considering all the attention " @entity8 " received ? @entity3 : i do n't think it was difficult for that reason			1
it 's one thing to write something about a poor lovable nerd who in some ways who could not find love and whose larger culture sort of rejects him and another to write about a messed - up - in - the - head cheater			1
and , to make that character and that story in some ways sympathetic was the greater challenge			1
@entity0 : was " @entity31 " more difficult to write than " @entity8 " ? @entity3 : no , i would n't say that			1
with me , all books are incredibly difficult			2
they all come with their formidable challenges			2
i 'm pretty much frightened of everything i write			2
this book just took longer			0
" @entity70 " took me 11 years , this book took me 16 years			0
i do n't think it was in any way more difficult , it just happened to take longer			0
@entity0 : what inspired you to write this book ? @entity3 : i think that you almost never get the inner life of men in any way that makes sense to men			1
most of the books i read where we hear about men 's internal life , i have to tell you , they are as far away from reality as you can imagine			1
these scientists always tell you that men spend every six seconds thinking about sex , but have you ever seen a book that in any way reflects sort of the larger masculine sensibilities ? i think part of me thought that it was important to get at men 's inner lives and , more importantly , more personally to use a @entity4 , @entity18 male in the background as sort of ground zero as the central reference			1
@entity0 : what does your family think about your writing ? @entity3 : i 'm convinced they ca n't really wrap their minds around it			2
we 're an immigrant family			0
we 're a conservative family			0
i 'm considered something of a nut because of the brutal honesty that i bring to some my stories			0
i think my family finds it a little appalling at times , but you know , what can you do ? you just pray that one day , they 'll get around to reading it and see the value in it			0
right now , i 've got to tell you , it is not on the table			0
i can go visit my family for four or five years straight and no one will mention that i 'm a writer			0
there 's something mildly improper about it , more like something mildly disreputable about it			2
@entity0 : is the voice in " @entity31 " similar to the way you speak ? @entity3 : it 's hard to say , because i live in so many different worlds ... the way i talk to my boys , family , work , the way i talk to my students , or the way i talk when i feel scared			1
the book is a highly wrought object			0
it may seem conversational or vernacular , it may lead people to believe that this is my voice but if i read a page , you would begin to realize how artificial the experience is			0
fiction is an artisan that convinces its reader that it 's real			2
the voice in the book , while it may have tone and highlights directly from me , this voice is highly artificial			0
it does n't really represent the way i speak			0
@entity0 : what is it that you want your readers to understand about this book ? @entity3 : there 's not a lesson that i 'm sort of asking my readers to walk away from but more of an encounter and a conversation that i 'm trying to encourage			1
again , i think that if one wants to teach a lesson , it 's so much better to write fiction			2
with nonfiction , we have a totally different set of stakes			0
what i was most committed to was using this male @entity4 experience to wrestle with , to encourage my readers to wrestle with , larger questions about masculinity , larger questions about relationships			1
