-- for better or worse , @entity1 and the @entity2 have been attached at the hip for decades			1
from the @entity5 to the 2003 invasion that toppled @entity7 to subsequent years marred by violence and instability , there 's no doubting the deep connection between the two nations			1
that 's largely thanks to policies crafted out of @entity14 , be they intended to contain or eliminate @entity7 or to stabilize and build up the fragile nation that remained in his wake			0
so it is no surprise that , with militants overrunning much of @entity1 and threatening its capital , people are turning to the @entity2			1
what can it do ? what will it do ? among @entity29 's options : option no. 1 : send in @entity2 troops as of monday , the @entity32 says it has only about 170 troops in @entity34 and 100 in undisclosed locations around the region			1
their job is to protect the @entity2 embassy and other @entity2 interests , the @entity32 said			1
that 's far from the troop levels of past @entity1 engagements			1
@entity2 troops did n't stay in @entity1 for long after driving @entity7 's military out of @entity46 in 1991 , but they did hunker down 12 years later after toppling the @entity48 regime			1
the responsibility that comes with rebuilding a country from over 6,000 miles away was one factor , but so was the continued violence			0
@entity2 troop levels in @entity1 peaked at 166,300 in october 2007 , according to the @entity32			1
critics derided the withdrawal of @entity2 troops by the end of 2011			1
among them was sen. @entity58 , who last week reiterated his disgust at that decision and called for the firing of @entity29 's national security team in part over what 's happened in @entity1			2
" could all this have been avoided ? " the @entity66 @entity65 said about the current state of @entity1 , though he did n't outright call for fresh military action			2
" and the answer is : absolutely yes			0
" the biggest , simplest way to make an impact in @entity1 : send @entity2 troops back into the country			1
but it wo n't happen again			0
@entity1 foreign minister @entity77 told @entity0 on thursday that no one is calling for " @entity2 troops into @entity1			1
" and of all options now on the table , it 's the only one that the @entity29 administration has explicitly nixed			0
" we are not contemplating ground troops , " @entity86 press secretary @entity85 said last week			1
" i want to be clear about that			0
" option no. 2 : @entity2 airstrikes still , while the @entity2 military might not have a role fighting on the ground in @entity1 , it could have a role over it			1
on monday , secretary of state @entity97 acknowledged to @entity98 that airstrikes on @entity1 targets are under consideration			2
the aircraft carrier @entity103 and five other warships are now in the @entity105			0
more than 500 @entity106 and dozens of helicopters are on standby			0
in the past , @entity1 have been very public about their desire to limit the involvement of the @entity2 military			1
yet , a @entity2 official said the @entity1 government had indicated a willingness for the @entity2 military to conduct airstrikes targeting members of the @entity116 in @entity1 and @entity117 ( @entity118 ) and other militants			1
@entity2 air power has proven effective before in campaigns such as @entity122 or @entity123			1
yet it 's not foolproof			0
last week , @entity85 deflected a question about whether @entity29 might consult @entity126 before sending warplanes into @entity1 -- saying it 's too early to give an answer because the president has n't decided the best course of action yet			2
attacking sites from the air comes with a host of limitations and challenges -- the risk of @entity2 casualties or capture should warplanes be shot down ; the unlikelihood of wiping out an insurgency from above ; the likelihood militants will blend into the civilian population and cause death and injury to the innocent			1
option no. 3 : provide more military aid unlike the first two options , the @entity2 government has already taken this course and has signaled it may do more			1
a @entity32 official says that about $ 15 billion in equipment , training and other services already have gone to @entity1			2
@entity85 reeled off some of the many items that have made their way east of late : millions of rounds of small arms fire , thousands of rounds of tank ammunition , hundreds of hellfire missiles , grenades , assault rifles , helicopters and much more			0
and that tally does n't include an additional $ 1 billion in arms -- including up to 200 @entity170 -- that are now in a 30 - day review period in @entity126			2
but @entity2 officials -- calling the current situation " extremely urgent " -- acknowledge that what 's already in @entity1 and what 's coming may not be enough			1
chief among those officials is @entity29 himself , who said last week : " @entity1 is going to need more help from us , and it 's going to need more help from the international community			1
" at the same time , it 's not like the billions of dollars worth of firepower proved all that effective against @entity118 fighters in places like @entity186 , @entity1 's second - largest city			2
witnesses reported seeing @entity1 security forces drop their weapons , even shed their uniforms , then run to safety			2
@entity192 , @entity2 ambassador to @entity1 from 2010 to 2012 and now a fellow with the @entity194 , characterized @entity1 's military as " ill - trained , badly led and not particularly competent			1
" " they clearly can not fire and maneuver , " said @entity192 , a @entity196 veteran			0
and it 's not just a matter of making sure that whatever resources sent to @entity1 are used effectively and not wasted			2
already , militants have been able to pick up weaponry , vehicles and other goods on its swift , vast sweep of @entity1 -- some of it supplied by the @entity2			1
" we are not surprised , " a defense official told @entity0			0
" it was a question of when , not if , something like this would happen			0
" option no. 4 : effect change politically in @entity1 beating back @entity118 by retaking @entity186 and other cities would be a huge victory for @entity1 's government			2
but it would n't be a complete , conclusive win unless the country can get its house in order			0
and doing that , according to experts and @entity2 officials , requires addressing what @entity0 's @entity223 has referred to as @entity1 's " political dysfunction			1
" one silver lining to the turmoil is prime minister @entity230 's government seems to be coordinating with the semiautonomous @entity232 government , @entity2 officials said			1
it appears @entity1 forces will team up with @entity232 fighters , known as the @entity236 , to combat @entity118			2
addressing the divisions between @entity238 and @entity239 , the two dominant @entity241 sects , in @entity1 is another matter			2
@entity230 's government , as well as the military , is dominated by @entity238 -- leaving @entity239 not only left out but also bitter , so much so that some of them may not see @entity118 as a worse option			0
" over the last several years , we have not seen the kind of trust and cooperation develop between moderate @entity239 and @entity238 leaders inside of @entity1 , " @entity29 said			0
" that accounts in part for some of the weakness of the state , and that carries over into the military			0
" vice president @entity259 has been talking regularly with @entity230 to try to effect political change , including possibly through a new unity government that gives @entity239 a prominent , hands - on role			0
still , words -- as opposed to , say , troops on the ground -- are sometimes only so effective			0
and it 's not like @entity230 has heeded @entity2 officials ' call for sectarian reconciliation and unity in the past			1
yet @entity14 's misgivings about the prime minister do n't change the fact that they support him , generally			0
the question is still how , exactly , they will support him			0
" there 's more that prime minister @entity230 should have done , could have done , over the course of time , " said @entity281 spokeswoman @entity280			0
" that 's a message we 've conveyed publicly and privately to him			0
" but the enemy here is ( @entity118 )			0
we need to work together and present a united front			0
" interactive : where is @entity1 's oil ? @entity118 : the first terror group to build an @entity241 state ? the siege of @entity186 : what 's happening ? recording : @entity118 promises more fighting in more @entity1 cities @entity0 's @entity301 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity2 has a long history in @entity1 , including the @entity5 and 2003 invasion
as @entity1 battles radical @entity309 militants , @entity2 officials have promised more help
air strikes and additional weaponry and aid are among the options being *mulled*
but ground troops have been ruled out , according to a @entity86 spokesman
