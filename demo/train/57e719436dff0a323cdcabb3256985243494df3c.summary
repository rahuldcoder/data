-- when you want news or information about your community , do you sometimes turn to your cell phone or tablet computer ? if so , you 've got plenty of company			2
according to new research from the @entity13 , nearly half ( 47 % ) of all @entity11 adults get at least some local news and information on their phone or tablet			1
according to @entity13 , here are the types of local information that mobile users reported they 've been getting : weather : 42 % local restaurants and other businesses : 37 % general local news : 30 % local sports scores and updates : 24 % local traffic and transportation : 22 % local coupons and discounts : 19 % news alerts : 15 % the growing trend in mobile local news and information is n't strictly a matter of civic consciousness ; weather , dining and shopping did top the list , after all			1
however , @entity13 did find that " [ m ] ore than a third ( 35 % ) of mobile local information consumers say they and others like them can have a big impact on their community			1
that compares with 27 % of those who do not connect to their communities on their mobile devices who feel that level of personal efficacy			0
" most mobile local news and information consumers ( 65 % ) believe that it 's now easier to keep up with information about their community than it was five years ago			1
about half get local news via six or more different sources or types of media each month			2
and three - fourths use social networking services like @entity68 or @entity69			0
about half of @entity11 @entity71 ( 52 % ) and african - americans ( 51 % ) reported getting local mobile news or information			1
whites were slightly behind , at 45 %			2
despite conventional wisdom that young people do n't care much about news or community , people ages 18 to 29 were by far most likely ( 70 % ) to access local information online -- and nearly half of these younger adults specifically report obtaining local news via their mobile devices			1
among people ages 30 to 49 , 63 % get mobile local news or information			1
this dropped to 33 % for people ages 50 to 64 , and to 8 % for those 65 and older			2
people who are parents of minor children are especially likely ( 64 % ) to get local mobile news or information -- compared with only 40 % of people with no minor children			1
the mobile digital divide is evident on the local front			0
wealthier people are especially likely to be mobile local news and information consumers			1
among households earning $ 75,000 per year or more , 67 % use cell phones or tablets to get local news or information , while only 39 % of households earning $ 30,000 or less per year do so			1
also , 58 % of college graduates are local mobile news consumers , compared with 25 % of people with less than a high school education			1
also , while @entity13 did n't specifically explore this issue , the mobile consumption of local news and information definitely is n't just a smartphone thing			1
@entity13 surveyed 2,251 adults via both land lines and cell phones , so it did not focus solely on smartphone and tablet users			0
this is key , since smartphones are still in the minority			0
according to @entity121 , as of january 2011 , just under 30 % of all @entity11 cell phone users owned smartphones			2
plus , @entity13 reports that currently , only 7 % of @entity11 adults own tablets ( mostly @entity123 ) and that most of those people also already own smartphones			2
therefore , a substantial number of people must be getting local news and information via cheaper , simpler feature phones , the next step down in features from smartphones			1
all of these phones can do text messaging , and most of them can also do e-mail and web browsing -- just with a clunkier , more limited interface and a slower data connection			0
this is significant because feature phones are probably not going away anytime soon			0
while smartphones are getting more popular , the huge popularity of feature phones is likely to continue for at least a few years			0
most consumers are n't willing or able to pay the typically high costs for smartphone handsets and carrier contracts			0
also , many consumers simply prefer less complex mobile devices			0
furthermore , feature phones are getting smarter and more useful			0
in particular , in the coming year , @entity153 's deal to make @entity155 the default browser on feature phones powered by its popular @entity159 mp platform will vastly improve the web browsing experience for a large portion of feature phone users			0
an improved user experience may soon lead to a boom in feature - phone web browsing of all kinds , including for local news and information			2
notably , only 13 % of mobile users reported having a local news or information application ( " app " ) installed on their phone			1
this means that for most local news and information producers , getting an @entity177 or @entity178 app probably should n't be the first step in their mobile strategy			2
other mobile channels -- especially the mobile web , e-mail , text messaging and social media integration -- can serve a far larger mobile audience			0
in fact , @entity13 discovered that the only real difference between users of local news mobile apps and other adults is that local news app users tend to be generally more into high - tech. they are n't even generally more affluent : only 19 % of @entity11 with an annual household income of $ 75,000 or more have local mobile news apps , compared with 12 % of people from households earning $ 30,000 or less per year			1
the survey was conducted january 12 - 25			0
its margin of error is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity208 .			0

52 % of @entity11 *hispanics* , 51 % of african - americans , 45 % of whites get mobile local news
