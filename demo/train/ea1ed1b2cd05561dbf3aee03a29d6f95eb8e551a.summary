-- compared with their @entity2 peers , @entity3 versus @entity4 , @entity5 versus @entity6 , @entity7 vs. @entity8 , the @entity9 leading e-commerce players have a much shorter history			1
however , they will take a bigger e-commerce share from the overall retail space soon			2
unlike in the @entity2 , most smaller cities in @entity9 have not been penetrated by organized retailers or consumer brands yet			1
this offers an opportunity for e-commerce to become the mainstream retail format for these cities			0
another reason is that the cost of commercial property in @entity9 went up significantly in the last decade			2
thus , consumer brands and retail merchants are more encouraged to migrate online while in the @entity2 , offline to online migration is mainly driven by labor cost and efficiency request			1
if not in 2013 , no later than 2014 , @entity9 's e-commerce will have a bigger gross merchandise volume than in the @entity2			1
please be aware that @entity9 's total retail sales is still much smaller than the @entity2 , which further demonstrates that e-commerce 's share in @entity9 will be much more significant			1
2015 , a breakthrough year for e-commerce in @entity9 why 2015 ? we need to understand the emerging cyber history in @entity9			1
almost all of @entity9 's leading @entity43 players ' birthdays are in 1999 , including @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , etc. in other words , there were no internet applications until 2000			1
people born on or after 1980 were over 20 years old in by 2000			0
they started to get access to the internet mostly after their campus lives			0
we call them a generation working in @entity43			0
take a look at people born on or after 1985			0
they were teenagers in 2000 when the @entity43 was just getting started in @entity9			2
this post- 1985 generation is one that lives on the @entity43 , and started from social , gaming to almost everything			0
by 2015 , this post- 1985 generation is reaching their 30s and becoming the core consumer group for almost every category			0
they have already migrated to the virtual space and they are the mainstream consumption power in @entity9			2
e-commerce will take such consumption power and make offline retail even weaker			0
different ecommerce business model is a must although i put @entity3 versus @entity4 , @entity5 vs. @entity6 , @entity7 versus @entity8 into respective peer group , they do not run the same business models and they do n't even look similar anymore			0
why the e-commerce model needs to be so different , we need to answer this question from a consumer angle and a merchant angle			1
as we mentioned above , @entity9 @entity43 consumers are younger , and they 're not mainstream yet			2
most of them have never been served by organized , retailed or consumer brands yet			2
@entity3 can evolve from an online flea market to t - mall and become the shopping entry portal , while @entity4 finds itself having difficulty getting rid of its secondhand products from its auction site			0
from a merchant 's point of view , there are millions of small but professional merchants in @entity9 , they will not just fill up @entity3 but they will also flood into @entity5 and @entity101 and become a major sales force in @entity9			1
any e-commerce platform 's success depends on winning these millions of merchants and they will make the pure online retail model very difficult in @entity9			1
behind these millions of merchants are hundreds of thousands of factories in @entity9			2
this is why such phenomenon does not exist in the @entity2 where you can hardly find any manufacturers			0
the monetization model in @entity9 for e-commerce is also very different			1
advertising model is better accepted by millions of small merchants rather than transaction fee or listing fees			0
even service powered by e-commerce needs a different model and will have a different future			0
when @entity123 is under challenge in the @entity2 , i believe that few @entity9 survivors , like @entity126 , from thousands of @entity9 @entity127 will have a brighter future than its original			1
the brighter future is based on at least one - third of restaurants and other small and medium business changing hands every year and their ongoing marketing demand will offer companies like @entity136 almost endless merchants list for promotion			0
on the other hand , the price sensitive consumers will be addicted to such service			0
winning tips for foreign players in @entity9 @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity4 , @entity6 , and @entity123 , as part of a very long list of @entity43 and e-commerce giants , have tried different ways through set - up by themselves , acquisition , joint venture with local key players , none of them can claim any success in @entity9 yet			2
unlike other internet applications , the e-commerce sector is least regulated and restricted by @entity9 authorities in comparison to other internet verticals			1
in my opinion , @entity2 players can not offer the real value to local consumers since their global technology and supply chain advantage can not be leveraged in @entity9			1
the cross-border management slows down the quick reaction required in this fast - moving market			0
my advice for @entity2 players is to humbly buy in minority shares in some emerging @entity9 e-commerce players and focus on cross-border synergies , such as cross-border tourism , education or shopping behaviors , etc. these cross-border activities will be growing more rapidly and such synergy can really leverage @entity2 peers ' strength and offer real value to @entity9 consumers .			1

unlike @entity2 , @entity9 has not been penetrated by organized retailers or brands yet
@entity191 predicts by 2014 , @entity9 's e-commerce will have bigger gross merchandise volume
