@entity0 has named a member of the radical student group that seized the @entity4 embassy in @entity5 and held @entity4 hostage for more than a year to be its next ambassador to the @entity8			1
@entity9 , was a member of the @entity11 students following the @entity12 , the group of militants who seized the @entity4 embassy on november 4 , 1979 , holding 52 @entity4 hostage for 444 days			1
a @entity4 official said the @entity16 has not yet responded to @entity9 's visa application to represent @entity0 at the @entity8			1
@entity9 is a veteran diplomat who has served as @entity0 's ambassador to @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , and the @entity22			1
he has also held high - profile posts in the @entity24			0
he currently works in the political affairs office of president @entity26 and is believed to be close to the @entity0 leader , who is widely viewed as a moderate with a reformist agenda			0
but the choice of @entity9 could complicate president @entity31 's efforts to re-engage with @entity5 after the election of @entity26 and negotiate a comprehensive agreement to curb @entity0 's nuclear program with five other world powers			1
with no formal relations between the @entity4 and @entity0 , the @entity0 mission to the @entity8 is @entity5 's only diplomatic operation in the @entity4 and has played a role in facilitating unofficial exchanges of messages between the two nations			1
in an interview with @entity0 media , @entity9 said he served as translator and negotiator , but denied taking part in the initial occupation of the embassy			2
@entity16 spokeswoman @entity50 declined to comment if the @entity4 was aware that @entity9 was a member of the group which seized the embassy			1
she said the @entity4 has a process to review all visa applications , but the applications themselves remained confidential			0
" anyone can submit a visa application , and it will be evaluated as we do all visa applications , in accordance with our procedures , " she said			2
" we do n't speculate on what the outcome might be			0
" but the controversy , first reported this weekend by @entity66 , could spark demands from @entity68 to deny @entity9 's visa			0
that would be an unusual step given the @entity4 is obligated to grant entry visas to representatives of @entity8 member - states in accordance with a 1947 agreement signed with the world body			2
last year , @entity79 president @entity78 decided not to attend the @entity80 when the @entity16 failed to respond to his visa application			1
the @entity82 has issued warrants for @entity78 's arrest and referral for trial in the @entity87 for crimes against humanity			0
although the @entity4 is not a party to the court , the @entity82 has asked the @entity4 to surrender him if he enters @entity4 territory			0
even if the @entity94 granted @entity9 a visa , he would not be free to move about the @entity4			2
as a representative of a country listed as a state sponsor of terrorism by the @entity16 , @entity9 would be confined to a radius of 25 miles from @entity100 , just as diplomats from @entity102 and @entity103 are			0
still , former @entity4 hostage @entity104 said it would be a " disgrace " if @entity107 gave a visa to @entity9 and called on the @entity31 administration to deny his application			1
" it may be a precedent but if the president and the @entity68 do n't condemn this act by the @entity119 , then our captivity and suffering for 444 days at the hands of @entity0 was for nothing , " he said in a statement			0
" he can never set foot on @entity4 soil			0
