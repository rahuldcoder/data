-- president @entity1 introduced a health care plan that he says will bridge the gap between the @entity5 and @entity6 bills passed last year			1
his proposal is similar to the @entity6 bill , with a few nods to the @entity5 plan			1
here are some of the highlights of his plan , according to the @entity5			2
basics the president says his health care proposal will help more than 31 million uninsured @entity17 get coverage			1
@entity1 says his plan includes the largest middle - class tax cut for health care in history			1
it establishes a health insurance market that would provide the same insurance choices that members of @entity26 have			1
health insurance exchanges , as proposed in the @entity6 bill , would be created to make it easier for small businesses , the self - employed and the unemployed to purchase less expensive coverage			1
there is no public option , an idea strongly backed by @entity35 but fiercely opposed both by @entity36 and key @entity38 moderates			1
like the @entity5 and @entity6 plans , @entity1 's proposal would bar insurers from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history or denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions			1
key differences @entity1 's plan eliminates the controversial proposal added to the @entity6 bill that exempts @entity51 from paying increased @entity53 expenses			2
it also provides additional federal financing to all of the states for the @entity53 expansion			0
the president 's proposal closes the @entity61 prescription drug " doughnut hole			0
" under current @entity61 limits , seniors must pick up the costs once their drug costs reach $ 2,830 and pay all costs out of pocket until they reach $ 4,550 , at which point @entity61 coverage kicks back in			0
@entity1 's proposal eases the " doughnut hole " in the short term by providing a $ 250 rebate to @entity61 beneficiaries who reach the limit in 2010			0
the plan closes the doughnut hole completely by 2020			0
the plan also establishes a @entity79 to provide an additional level of oversight of insurance premium increase at the federal level , giving the government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies			2
tax credits the president 's proposal increases federal subsidies to help people buy insurance			0
new health insurance subsidies would be provided to families making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level			2
compared to the @entity6 bill , @entity1 's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $ 44,000 and $ 66,000 , according to the @entity5			2
compared to the @entity5 bill , it lowers premiums for families making between $ 55,000 and $ 88,000			0
@entity1 's plan also provides more cost - sharing assistance than the @entity5 and @entity6 bills for families with incomes below $ 55,000			1
for families making about $ 55,000 , the president 's proposal matches the assistance in the @entity6 bill			0
penalties and fees the @entity5 and @entity6 bills both require payments from individuals who choose not to get health care coverage			1
@entity1 's plan lowers the maximum penalty for individuals			0
@entity1 's plan also provides $ 40 billion in tax credits for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees			1
like the @entity6 bill , the president 's proposal does not mandate that employers provide insurance			2
under @entity1 's plan , companies with more than 50 employees would be required to pay a fee of $ 2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company 's workers receives federal health care subsidies			1
the first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation			0
as with the individual requirement , this represents a compromise between the @entity5 and @entity6 plans			2
@entity1 's proposal delays the $ 67 billion assessment on health insurers , pushing it to 2014 , when exchanges and the new health insurance market will be set up			0
the president 's proposal also increases the revenue drawn from the pharmaceutical industry to $ 23 billion over the next three years -- $ 10 billion more than the @entity6 bill			0
it delays the implementation of these fees to 2011			0
waste , fraud and abuse the president 's proposal includes a number of provisions to help eliminate waste and fight fraud			0
some of those provisions include establishing @entity61 sanctions databases , increasing access to the health care integrity and protection data bank , expanding efforts to recover overpayments made to providers and suppliers , and establishing a system to more quickly identify potentially fraudulent payments			2
@entity1 's proposal also calls for preventing delays in access to generic drugs			0
questions the president 's proposal does n't address many of the sticking points that hung up the @entity5 and @entity6 bills			1
@entity1 says his plan also reduces the deficit by $ 100 billion over the next decade and about $ 1 trillion over the following decade by " cutting government overspending and reining in waste , fraud and abuse			0
" the @entity5 says the plan would cost about $ 950 billion over the next 10 years , but that 's not an official estimate			2
there are also not a lot of specifics on how to pay for the plan			0
the @entity6 plan , according to the nonpartisan @entity190 , would cost an estimated $ 871 billion ; the more expansive @entity5 plan has been estimated to cost over $ 1 trillion			1
the @entity1 plan resembles the @entity6 version on how to block subsidies from funding abortions , choosing it over the more conservative @entity5 version			1
on health care and illegal immigrants , the president 's proposal follows the @entity6 language , which imposes far more limits on undocumented workers than the @entity5 version			1
outlook @entity1 's proposal is a long way from becoming law			0
his proposal would need to be drafted into legislation , debated and passed by the @entity5 and @entity6			1
as the past year has shown , health care is an emotional subject , and debate can drag on for months			1
immediate reaction from @entity36 suggests that this time around , it wo n't be any easier			0
" nearly one year ago , the president moderated a health care summit that kicked off a national debate that has led us to where we are today : a partisan bill devoid of support from the @entity17 people and a diminished faith in this government 's capacity to listen			1
let 's not make the same mistake twice , " senate minority leader @entity227 said			0
@entity5 minority leader @entity230 revived the abortion debate , saying , " republicans are also standing with the @entity17 people by calling for health care reform to protect human life and not use taxpayer money to fund abortion			1
... health care reform should be an opportunity to protect human life -- not end it -- and the @entity17 people agree			2
" @entity0 's @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
