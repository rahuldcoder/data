-- in a summer crowded with books about vampires , werewolves and things that go bump in the night , a young novelist is stepping forward with his own fresh take on the supernatural suspense thriller			2
@entity9 's newest novel is " @entity10			1
" at 28 - years old , it 's hard to call @entity9 a veteran , but this is his eighth novel already			1
his work has won high praise from critics and some well - known peers , including best - selling authors @entity18 and @entity20			2
set in rural @entity22 , @entity9 's book includes a murder , a lonely lawman in love with a dangerous woman and a newspaper veteran determined to dig up the truth			1
but the story adds some chilling and unexpected twists , including a landlocked lighthouse , a mysterious blue light and a home for rescued lions , tigers and other big cats			1
@entity0 caught up with the author and the following is an edited transcript			1
@entity0 : what was the spark behind " @entity10 " ? @entity9 : i wanted to write a contemporary thriller that drew from the feel of frontier folklore and legend			1
a single image -- a homemade lighthouse built in the woods -- got me started			2
i ca n't explain how i got to that , because i simply do n't know			2
one day it was just there , and i 've never loved a book cover as much as this one , because it captures the feel i had from the image : mysterious , haunting , ominous			2
a lot of the ghostly tales and legends that were in my mind at the time involved cats -- the mythical black panthers people are always claiming to spot , particularly -- and that gave the idea some traction , because i had a very real setting with which to work			1
there 's a place in @entity66 , not far from my hometown of @entity68 , called the @entity69			1
this operation , which is truly out in the middle of nowhere , down a long gravel road , is currently home to 230 tigers , lions , cougars , leopards and other exotic cats that have been rescued from terrible , abusive circumstances			1
the center exists simply to provide safe homes for cats that have none			1
the very idea that there are so many exotic cats in need is strong on its own merits , but the center was also a gold mine of atmosphere for a novelist			1
it can be a very intimidating place the first time you see it			2
and , of course , these large cats are and always have been a source of endless fascination for humans			1
every civilization that ever interacted with these animals had their own set of stories , symbolism and myth			1
so the spark was in the intersection of these things , in the idea of trying to create something very original that also carried with it a generations old weight of familiarity , that sense of legend			2
@entity0 : you started out writing crime novels , what prompted the change to supernatural ? @entity9 : initially , it was simply the right fit for the story , that being " @entity127			1
" i knew i wanted to draw upon the history and mythology that surrounded @entity131 , which was this glorious resort around the early 20th century , when people came from around the world to experience what they believed were truly miraculous mineral springs			2
it was also a story that required bridging eras			2
those things just kept shouting " ghost story ! " and so i listened			1
during the course of writing that book , i really fell in love with the form			1
it did n't seem all that different to me -- still suspense , still mystery , just with a new layer , an added wrinkle			0
the supernatural elements were more of a plotting challenge , too , and i think good things happen when you challenge yourself as a writer			0
i never envisioned , early on , that i 'd write anything with a supernatural thread			0
i suppose i should n't be overly surprised , because one of the really key moments in my writing life was when i found @entity161 's book " on @entity165 , " which is the definitive work on the craft for anyone who values storytelling first and foremost			1
at the time , while i read widely , i was very focused on writing detective novels			1
people do n't really consider it because i 'm a younger writer , but when " the @entity169 , " the last of my detective novels to date , was released , i 'd been working in that form for a decade			0
trying something a little different was wonderful , creatively			0
you have only so many chances to tell stories			1
i did n't want to be forever wedded to one form of storytelling when there are so many out there			0
@entity0 : i 've heard several of your novels may hit the the big screen ? @entity9 : @entity183 , who directed the first two @entity185 films and was the family comedy king through the ' 80s and ' 90s -- " mrs. @entity189 , " " @entity190 , " etc. -- has acquired rights to " the @entity192 " and is working on the script himself , with intent to direct			1
" i 'm actually working on adapting the book with @entity196 , who was just nominated for an @entity197 for " @entity198 , " and who also wrote " @entity200 , " which i think is a terrific screenplay			0
the chance to work with @entity196 is a tremendous pleasure and i 'm learning a lot			0
@entity0 : you 've worked as a private investigator , a journalist and a teacher but i understand you knew at a young age that you wanted to be a writer ? @entity9 : always , yeah			1
this was what i wanted to do from the time i began to read			0
i just fell in love with stories , with books			1
i finished my first novel , it was around 300 pages long , when i was 16			0
wrote one more before i got out of high school , then wrote the first @entity224 novel when i was 19			0
it did n't sell , but i liked the character and i knew the world so i tried what was , in my mind , a sequel			0
wrote that when i was 20 , and that one made it			0
that 's " tonight i said goodbye , " which came out when i was 21 and won some prizes and was nominated for the @entity236 and translated into a bunch of foreign languages , all while i was working two jobs and going to school			1
looking back on that now , it seems impossible			0
the time management seems impossible			0
but right then , it was just my life , and i was having a lot of fun			0
i wrote from midnight to 3 a.m. because that was when i had free time			0
it never felt like work			0
it was fun , it was all i wanted to do , to be			0
i just wanted to get something between the covers , as my friend @entity255 says about his books			0
i love that phrase , particularly when it comes from such a brilliant novelist as @entity255 , who is as good as anybody alive			0
there 's a humility in that , a gratitude : " just to get it between the covers			1
" the idea that it 's a privilege to have that chance is really a good thing to remember			1
@entity0 : i understand music is a big source of inspiration to you while you write ? @entity9 : it runs the engine , plain and simple			1
at the start , i needed headphones because i was writing in my college apartment and my roommate was , you know , entitled to do his thing and not create a cocoon of silence for my attempts at genius			1
then i realized how much the music was impacting the mood of the writing , and i started to pair things up -- this song for this kind of scene , things like that			1
then i 'd get superstitious -- you 've had a good run on this playlist , do n't change it until things tighten up			0
like a baseball player not changing socks			0
i usually pick one song that i listen to with my eyes closed every day before i start writing			2
that can range from classical to rap			0
in one case , a song inspired the entire book			2
" @entity127 " developed from my imagining a story behind @entity311 's violin piece " @entity312			2
" for " @entity10 " i was really into @entity313 , riding their album " @entity317 " pretty hard , and a band called @entity316 , and of course the two artists i quote in the book , @entity321 and @entity322			1
@entity324 has made a good name for himself but @entity322 is criminally overlooked at this point			0
he 'll be around for a long , long time , though			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity9 : i stepped back and took a breath			1
that needed to be done			0
i went almost two months without writing a word of prose , but i needed that after the last stretch , i really did			2
now i 'm back at it			0
the next book is a return to traditional crime fiction , no ghosts in sight , and it is one i 've wanted to write for a long time			0
it 's about two brothers who lost a sibling to violent crime when they were in their teens , and went about coping in very different ways			2
one is an ex-cop turned bail bondsman , the other a high school football coach who is involved with prison ministry			0
it 's set in @entity353 , where high school football is a very big deal , and i 've always wanted to mine from sports for fiction and never really had a chance			2
as i said earlier , we have a limited number of shots , so i felt it was time to take this one .			0

@entity9 's newest novel is " @entity10 , " his eighth at age 28
@entity9 was inspired by ghost stories and a rescue center for exotic cats
music is a huge inspiration for the author and has become a part of his writing process
