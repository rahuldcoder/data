@entity0 -- the political posturing , and theater , related to the fiscal cliff continued thursday as @entity6 leaders squared off over whether to make it harder for @entity7 to block future increases in the debt ceiling			1
at issue was a move by @entity6 minority leader @entity13 , and meant to put @entity14 in a tough spot , that backfired			1
@entity16 pushed for a vote on an idea he first proposed last year as part of the debt ceiling standoff			1
movement in fiscal cliff talks the legislation would allow the president to increase the debt ceiling without congressional approval , though @entity7 could block the move if a two - thirds majority of both the @entity29 and @entity6 voted to disapprove it			1
@entity14 want the change because raising the limit has become increasingly contentious , as @entity32 have demanded spending cuts and other reforms to go along with it			0
another debt limit increase is needed early next year			0
@entity16 now opposes the change he once advanced because it was intended as a one - time solution to the deadlock over the debt last year			0
nevertheless , he pushed for a vote on it because he wanted to show that even some @entity14 oppose giving the president that much authority , and he knew there was no way @entity14 could garner the 60 votes typically needed for major legislation to pass the @entity6			2
but in the back - and - forth legislative chess match that often plays out on the @entity6 floor , senate majority leader @entity51 instead moved to pass the measure with a 51 - vote threshold , confident that he had at least that many votes to give @entity14 a victory			2
recognizing that , @entity16 objected to voting at the lower threshold , meaning he was filibustering the bill he had just pushed for a vote			0
@entity61 visits ' middle class ' family as expected , @entity14 did declare victory and argued that @entity32 defeat was another sign that they are losing the bigger battle over the fiscal cliff			1
" senator @entity16 's filibuster prevented us from having this vote today , but i will continue to seek an agreement to hold an up - or - down vote on his proposal to avoid another debt ceiling debacle , " @entity51 said			1
" we have the higher ground , " said sen. @entity77 , @entity79 - @entity78			0
" they know that they got burnt the last time by using the debt ceiling for political leverage			0
things are even more in our advantage today			0
" @entity16 move on debt ceiling backfires			2
