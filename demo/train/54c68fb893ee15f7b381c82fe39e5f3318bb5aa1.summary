-- a @entity2 activist group has launched a new ad campaign to reclaim a word they say has been abused and distorted by @entity2 extremists and by anti-muslim groups			1
the @entity9 ad campaign is using print ads and social media to educate the public about what they say is the true meaning of the word " jihad			1
" the @entity19 dictionary defines the term as " 1 : a holy war waged on behalf of @entity2 as a religious duty ; also : a personal struggle in devotion to @entity2 especially involving spiritual discipline " and " 2 : a crusade for a principle or belief			1
" but some religious activists dispute the emphasis on " holy war			0
" they say the word is often misunderstood and has been co-opted and " misapplied " by radical @entity2 who use it to justify terrorist acts and by @entity36 groups who use the word to foment fear in non-muslims			1
" the word ' jihad ' literally means struggle , struggle for a good cause , " said @entity41 , national executive director of the @entity42			1
" it is a concept , a noble concept , within @entity2 that emphasizes a personal struggle within yourself to be a better person , a better husband , better wife , better worker , better neighbor , " he explained			1
" it is not aggression , and it does not mean to commit harm against other people			1
if people commit harm against innocent people , it will be in violation of the spirit of @entity2 and a violation of the concept of jihad			1
" lawyers seek to limit @entity70 police surveillance of @entity2 the campaign is the brainchild of @entity73 , an activist who is also the executive director of @entity42 in @entity74			1
he launched the effort in december with a small group of activists			2
they began running ads on 25 city buses in @entity74 and later expanded to buses in @entity82			0
the ads began running at four metro stations in @entity85 in late january			0
they depict @entity2 and @entity40 sharing how they define their personal struggles			2
one shows a white @entity90 man and a black @entity2 man standing side by side , with the slogan " # @entity9 is to build bridges across the aisle			2
" another shows a young female photographer wearing a headscarf and holding a camera			0
the slogan reads " # @entity9 is to capture the truth even when it 's unpopular			0
" @entity103 said the donor - funded campaign is about making sure @entity2 children can grow up in a world where they 're judged on their own merits and not according to radical stereotypes			2
controversial ' @entity111 ' ad in @entity70 subways ? " i do n't wake up in the morning looking for my kalashnikov or @entity116 , " he said , highlighting one such stereotype			0
the group has also taken its campaign to social media , asking supporters to post on their @entity122 pages and use @entity9 on @entity123 to share their personal struggles			1
@entity103 said they have received tens of thousands of encouraging tweets , @entity122 messages , letters and e-mails			0
the campaign has also attracted skeptics , especially online			0
a user with the @entity123 handle @ @entity133 wrote : " @entity134 : # @entity9 is carrying ' earth - shattering , shocking and terrifying ' attacks against ' heart of the land of non-belief ' -- @entity140 and @entity141			0
" another user , with the handle @ @entity149 , wrote : " claiming that critics read the @entity151 ' out of context ' is another way of saying that you wish it did not say what it plainly does # myjihad			0
" @entity41 said the organizers of the campaign should expect to face resistance to their message but believes they will be successful in starting a conversation about this important tenet of @entity2			2
faith groups launch campaign to counter controversial ' @entity111 ' ad " it 's an uphill battle , because you are trying to dismantle preconceived ideas about the concept of jihad , because traditionally people have seen stereotypes and they have seen actions by some @entity2 , and the majority of @entity2 did not step in to say , ' no , this is our faith , and we are going to claim it , ' " he said			1
" it is going to be an uphill battle , because you are trying to undo accumulation of misperception and mispractice -- misperception by non-muslims and mispractice by some @entity2 , and i think it 's important for us to take this initiative			2
" the group hopes to place ads in more cities in the @entity140 and around the world and to expand to other media such as radio and television			1
" the message is global			0
the goal is anti-radicalization , " @entity103 said .			0
