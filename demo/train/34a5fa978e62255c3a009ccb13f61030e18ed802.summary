-- more than ever , the @entity1 are thinking and hearing about sex			1
sex in high places , for a change			2
the thick wall that separated the public and private lives of our ruling elite and kept their backstage manners out of the headlines is now crumbling at a fast pace			2
and the @entity14 earthquake has a lot to do with it			1
two criminal cases against the former director of the @entity19 , one closed in @entity20 , the other still pending in northern @entity1 after his indictment for alleged promotion of prostitution , have given the press more than an opportunity , a civic obligation to tip - toe around our strict privacy laws and question , for the first time , their cozy gentleman 's agreement with the powerful			1
now what ? things are changing			0
today , @entity36 , a journalist at the daily liberation , tells in his new book how , nearly four years ago , he got the scoop about the opening of an internal investigation at the @entity19 on @entity14 's relationship with a subordinate ; and how his editors of the time killed the story			1
( the @entity47 finally got the tip )			0
until this year , also , excellent journalists at @entity50 like @entity51 and @entity52 would not have found a publisher willing to release their own book , " @entity55 , " a chronicle of the life of @entity14 and his famous journalist wife @entity58			1
now a best - seller , their investigation certainly describes numerous flavors of @entity14 's behavior			1
but it deals more with another relationship , the bizarre ménage à trois between the elite circles , @entity1 citizens and the truth			1
in @entity1 , centuries of feudal privileges did not disappear at the birth of the @entity72			1
in the last 40 years , most privacy laws were created not by the demand of citizens fearing the @entity76 state , but rather by the political class itself , to keep its safe distance from the electorate			0
and self - censorship ruled			0
in a recent documentary ( about @entity14 ) a @entity1 media critic recalled the time when , as a rookie in 1982 , he asked a seasoned correspondent at the @entity87 what president @entity88 did after work			1
the answer came , in a blasé voice that hinted at a banal routine : " he leaves his office around 6:30			0
then , he just spends the evening with his second family			0
" this fact was made public only in 1994 , when @entity88 gave a green light for a cover picture in @entity99 showing his beloved daughter with him			0
just over a year later , she was at his funeral with her mother , an act of public regal recognition that moved the nation			0
@entity14 , like other avatars of the system , reveled in his own kind of aristocratic and exclusive playground			1
silence and immunity became the measure , the flattering reflection of his growing power and nobility			1
his demise in @entity1 could be seen as the symbolic start of a new era of openness , but we are still in an awkward transition period , where the @entity1 public opinion is trying hard to find its mark			1
until @entity126 , no president had ever divorced , out of fear it would irritate the shrinking number of @entity130 in the electorate , or open a @entity132 of distasteful revelations ; but sexual morality has never been a reliable electoral criterion			0
rumors on the internet have upstaged uncertain values , fed cynicism and the rise of populist movements , a blanket ideology of the " @entity143 " ( they are all rotten ) at the core of the extreme right - wing psyche			0
but in the current confusion , many @entity1 would prefer to maintain good old privacy , especially in its male - friendly version			1
during the @entity14 epic , for example , women who dared to connect the dots between his character flaws and eligibility for office , saying they would not vote for a misogynist , were often ridiculed as nuns or man - haters			2
most people , in spite of the current publishing frenzy , would rather know less , and keep power on its safe pedestal			1
that trend started before @entity14 , when @entity126 , dumped by his second wife right after his election in 2007 , had to become the president next door , and rebuild his life " live " with glamorous @entity172			2
ironically , for acting like a mere mortal , be it on prime time , in luxurious and idyllic conditions , he was accused of desecrating the presidency : too visible , too " bling bling , " too out of touch			0
his successor , @entity180 , won as " mr @entity181			0
" but his life is far from uneventful			0
his separation with his companion @entity183 , a prominent socialist , a former presidential candidate and mother of his four children , totally disturbed their party in 2007			0
his flame ever since , now the @entity189 , named @entity190 , a journalist , is still so consumed by jealousy that she tweeted her support for @entity183 's political opponent during the last parliamentary elections			2
her move , a cyber-age rendition of 18th century boudoir warfare , openly contributed to the defeat of her nemesis , ruining her chances to become the president of the @entity203			0
the truth is out now , but it is not certain the @entity1 like it that way			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : the @entity14 cases have given the press the chance to question the powerful
the most powerful in society used to enjoy silence and immunity , he says
he says @entity14 's demise in @entity1 could be seen as symbolic of a new era of openness
@entity210 : despite the current publishing frenzy , most people would rather know less
