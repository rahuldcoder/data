-- pope @entity2 generally comes off as so hip , so completely at home in the 21st century , it 's tempting to forget he 's also a deeply religious believer and therefore sees the world fairly differently than most of his fellow celebrities and pop culture icons			0
we 'll get a reminder of the point on sunday , when @entity2 presides over a service in @entity14 's @entity13 featuring a rare public exhibit of what @entity17 tradition regards as the bones of @entity20 , the @entity21 's first pope			1
the secular mind ca n't help asking , " are these really @entity20 's bones ? " and " how do we know ? " for believers such as @entity2 , however , the more relevant question is , " what spiritual message do they have ? " in a nutshell , the pope , as well as the throngs of believers who 'll line up to see the bones , will venerate them not on the basis of empirical evidence , but a spiritual conviction that they evoke the very origins of the papacy and of @entity38			1
they invite devotees to see themselves as part of a 2,000 - year " communion of saints " whose original leader was a poor fisherman , who the @entity46 says denied @entity48 three times , yet whose faith was so strong in the end that he gave his life to defend it			0
the exhibit is designed to wrap up a " @entity57 " for @entity54 around the world originally launched under pope @entity56 , and carried to its conclusion by @entity2			1
to be sure , there 's a beguiling detective story behind the bones			2
detective story @entity13 was originally constructed in 330 a.d. by the @entity63 , over an old pagan cemetery believed to be the burial site of @entity20 , whom tradition holds was martyred by being crucified upside down			1
for the next sixteen centuries nobody poked around underneath the basilica to see what was actually down there , feeling that the site was too sacred to be disturbed			0
in 1923 , however , the world was dazzled by the discovery of @entity75 's tomb in @entity76 , a global sensation that left a deep impression on a young @entity80 cleric named @entity81			0
when @entity81 became pope @entity81 in 1939 , he authorized a dig under the basilica , and in 1942 archeologists found a niche they believed housed @entity20 's remains			1
unfortunately , the fragments turned out to belong to several people			0
it took a couple decades before experts singled out a set of bones belonging to a man who had been 5ft 7in tall , of heavy build , and who was aged between 60 and 70 at the time of his death , all of which were consistent with traditional depictions of @entity20			1
stains suggested the bones had been wrapped in a purplish , gold - threaded cloth , symbolizing a person of importance			1
most intriguing , an inscription was found near the cavity that linguists reconstructed as @entity109 , which in ancient @entity110 could mean , " @entity20 is within			2
" that was enough for @entity112 , the pope at the time , who announced in 1968 that the bones of @entity20 had been identified " in a manner which we believe convincing			1
" yet debate swirled then , and still does , about how reliable that identification actually is			0
logic of faith in truth , all one can say for certain is that these are ancient human remains found in a spot devoted to @entity20 's memory			2
since there 's no dna sample to compare , there 's no way of proving whether the bones are really his			2
a top @entity133 official conceded as much in 2000 , saying the @entity21 is in a " very discrete and insecure position " on the bones and that references to @entity20 's remains are " a bit relative			1
" it 's similar to the situation with the alleged bones of @entity142 , preserved in another @entity14 basilica , which were subjected to carbon - 14 testing in 2007 under pope @entity56 and shown to come from the first century			2
that test provides a date , but not an identity			0
in other words , we still do n't know if the bones really belong to the apostle			0
that 's where the logic of faith takes over			0
first of all , the bones @entity2 will venerate on sunday spent centuries resting in the site linked to @entity20 's martyrdom and burial			1
that history makes them , at a minimum , what @entity17 tradition regards as " relics by contact , " meaning objects physically connected to the legacy of the saint			0
beyond that , @entity2 knows these bones have been hallowed by countless acts of prayer and devotion , and that like other famous relics , such as the @entity176 or the @entity177 , they evoke awe and devotion regardless of their actual provenance			2
especially for the first pope from @entity182 , a continent where popular devotion is the very soul of religious experience , that mystical power is not to be dismissed			0
faith , as the @entity46 puts it , lies in " the evidence of things not seen			0
" in that sense , an exhibit of the bones of @entity20 , surrounded by scientific controversy yet wrapped in a blanket of belief , is probably the perfect capstone for a " @entity57			1
" read more : @entity56 to put ' @entity13 bones ' on display read more : @entity56 embraces severely disfigured man read more : a popular pope , but the same old church ? read more : would the @entity203 target @entity2 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206			1

@entity54 will *gather* at the @entity133 sunday for service marking " @entity57 "
bones believed to be those of @entity20 will be displayed for first time
@entity133 *analyst* says while bones ' identity is *unconfirmed* , they are an object of devotion
@entity206 : bones are a " scientific controversy *...* wrapped in a blanket of belief "
