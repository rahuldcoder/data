-- a judge 's ruling thursday makes another child waiting for a lung transplant in @entity4 more quickly eligible for adult lungs			1
the family of @entity7 , 11 , asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block a policy that keeps children younger than 12 from being prioritized for available adult lung transplants			1

the ruling comes a day the same judge granted an injunction for 10 - year - old @entity25 , whose parents ' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight			1
her family has argued that because the number of children 's lungs available through organ donation programs is so small , @entity25 -- and other pediatric patients like her -- should be added to the list of people waiting for adult lungs , prioritized by severity of their illnesses			1

" but we 're very excited with the news today , that she will have the opportunity to be equally judged and have the opportunity to receive lungs , " he said			2
the @entity4 girl has been waiting 18 months for another pair of lungs as her ability to breathe has rapidly deteriorated			2

earlier this week , the @entity80 asked @entity15 to change the rules			0
