-- for once it was n't @entity2 facing the hard questions			0
the @entity5 manager has faced a barrage of criticism from fans and media this season , but this week he has led the @entity12 club to vital victories in the @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
by contrast , much of the focus ahead of sunday 's home match against @entity19 was on the struggling team 's controversial appointment of manager @entity23			1
is he a fascist or not ? will he talk about it ? was his hiring a massive misjudgment of public opinion by @entity30 owner @entity29 in this political climate of ultra correctness , especially given @entity19 's strong commercial ties to @entity34 ? it was enough to prompt the resignation of the club 's vice-chairman , former @entity39 foreign secretary @entity37 , but fan associations have largely been supportive of the @entity42 's arrival			1
after sunday 's 2 - 1 defeat , which left @entity19 outside the relegation zone only on goal difference , @entity23 was questioned about his political beliefs -- but the former member of @entity42 club @entity48 's right - wing hardcore supporters ' group refused to dwell on specifics			1
" as a person you do n't change , but you become an adult , you become a manager , " he told reporters , who had been asked by @entity19 's press officer not to ask non-football questions , having released a statement earlier in the week insisting he does not support fascist ideology			1
" you can also handle your nature because you know now you 're not a footballer , now you have responsibility for many others			0
" obviously your nature never changes , but you can lead , you can guide because you know that you have to be careful sometimes when you do something			0
" i do n't think you are the same person than 20 years ago , 10 years ago			1
we maintain the principles of when we were growing up , but we change a bit as a man , now as a manager			0
" @entity23 , renowned for his colourful gestures as a player in the @entity14 with @entity76 and as a manager with lower league @entity79 , had his full repertoire on show at @entity82			1
his team took the lead through an own - goal by @entity86 , then conceded their own by @entity87 and then went down to a fortunate deflection by @entity89 off a shot by @entity5 teammate @entity91			2
" i am more than happy for the first half			0
@entity5 obviously dominate when they keep the ball , against any other side at @entity82 , but we were very organized , " @entity23 said			2
" the second half was difficult			0
in the last few days i studied the players and i know exactly what they can give in energy			0
the two goals came from little mistakes , and we will work to give them more energy in the next few weeks			0
we have a short time but we are capable			0
" @entity2 has a short time left in his interim @entity5 tenure , but he has many more games scheduled than @entity19 's six			1
next thursday 's trip to @entity110 to face @entity111 in the second - tier @entity16 is the start of a run of four games in 10 days for last season 's @entity116 champions , including an @entity15 semifinal against @entity119 next sunday and then @entity14 trips to @entity121 and @entity122			1
the @entity124 side then have potentially the @entity16 semifinals plus four final @entity14 games in which to secure a place in next season 's @entity128			1
@entity2 expects that race to go to the final day of the campaign , despite @entity5 nudging ahead of @entity132 into third place on goal difference			1
" @entity132 and @entity136 are pushing , and @entity137 , so we have to carry on until the end , " the @entity135 said			2
" hopefully we can do well next week in the cup competitions and after against @entity121 and @entity122			0
with too many games in a short period of time , it 's important to keep the team winning			0
" @entity132 's tendency for late - season nerves continued on sunday , with former @entity5 manager @entity149 ' team needing a late equalizer against sixth - placed @entity137			1
@entity151 put the home side ahead but @entity137 replied through veteran former @entity155 international @entity153 and @entity157 striker @entity156			2
@entity158 striker @entity151 then hit the post late on , but @entity160 -- who scored the leveler in thursday 's @entity16 quarterfinal first leg against @entity163 -- followed up to score from the rebound			0
it left @entity132 level on points with @entity5 and two ahead of fifth - placed @entity136 , having played one more match than both @entity124 rivals as they fight for top - four spots			1
seventh - placed @entity122 's hopes of @entity116 football next season appear over after a 0 - 0 draw with @entity76 that left @entity176 ' team seven points behind @entity136 , having played one more match			2
at the other end of the table , bottom team @entity180 ' bid to avoid relegation suffered a big blow after conceding an injury - time equalizer against fellow strugglers @entity186			0
big - spending @entity180 had striker @entity187 sent off in the first half for a needless head - high lunge , but took a late lead through @entity192 forward @entity193 's fourth goal in five games			0
however , @entity196 -- who had set @entity193 free on goal -- conceded a free - kick and @entity199 curled the set - piece through the @entity180 wall to put third - bottom @entity186 level on points with @entity19			2
@entity204 moved five points clear of the relegation battle with a 1 - 0 win at home to 10th - placed @entity121 , as striker @entity209 scored the only goal in time added on .			2

sunday 's 2 - 1 win over @entity19 puts @entity5 third in @entity14
@entity19 manager , asked about being a fascist , says " your nature never changes "
@entity23 also says , " i do n't think you are the same person than 20 years ago "
@entity132 's bid for @entity128 place *falters* with 2 - 2 draw against @entity137
