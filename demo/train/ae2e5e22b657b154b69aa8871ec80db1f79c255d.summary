-- sports venues in the @entity5 have come full circle , going from embodying the history of a city , its teams and fans to multipurpose cookie - cutter structures and back to sport - specific complexes designed with a retro look and feel			1
there are movements afoot to save some of these unused and often - forgotten places			0
some are successful , some fail and some are yet to be decided			0
here are some of the most endangered well - known sports sites in the @entity5 and a couple that were sacrificed in the name of progress , selected by @entity0 in conversation with the @entity24			1
@entity25 the @entity25 was built on the tip of @entity27 during the early 1960s to help boost @entity25 tourism and is the only venue in the @entity5 designed for watching boat races			1
over time , it became a multipurpose spectator facility , also hosting concerts and sunrise easter morning services			0
its floating barge stage was the setting for @entity38 's hug of @entity39 during the @entity40			2
@entity41 closed for 20 years and facing demolition for development , @entity25 commissioners voted this summer to give the nonprofit group friends of the @entity25 control of the property while it creates a plan to renovate and reopen the facility			1
the canopied structure has more than 6,500 seats , and the man - made basin that serves as the " track " for boat races is longer than the @entity56 in @entity57 , according to the stadium 's modernist - influenced architect , @entity58			1
@entity60 , @entity61 the @entity60 was tagged the " @entity62 " when it opened in 1965			1
it was the first multipurpose , domed sports facility and its name also became synonymous with artificial turf			2
the former home of the @entity69 and @entity70 altered the course of sports venues in the @entity5 : many professional sports cities -- @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity77 , @entity79 and @entity80 -- built similar multipurpose stadiums -- some covered and some open - air -- for both football and baseball			1
the future of the @entity60 has been up in the air since 2009			1
the @entity70 left @entity87 for @entity88 in the late 1990s and the @entity69 played their last game at the dome in 1999			2
@entity92 voters will vote this november on a bond initiative to renovate the dilapidated structure , which once hosted @entity95 , @entity96 and the 1992 @entity97 , into a modernized civic center			0
@entity100 's most endangered historic places @entity102 's gym , @entity74 the building that houses @entity102 's @entity101 has stood in @entity74 since 1895 , according to the @entity104			1
born in @entity105 , @entity102 made his way to @entity107 and , despite being diagnosed with cataracts , became a boxer , won a gold medal in @entity111 in 1964 and settled in @entity74			1
in 1968 he turned the three - story structure into his personal gym , living upstairs and training downstairs			0
" @entity102 , " who defended the heavyweight championship in 1971 by becoming to the first person to beat @entity95 as a professional , also won an olympic gold medal in boxing in 1964			2
@entity102 sold the building in 2008 and died of liver cancer in 2011			1
the structure was on the brink of oblivion until this year , when it was added to the @entity126			0
@entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 @entity127 opened in 1932 in @entity128 , @entity129 , and was home to the @entity131 , the @entity132 and the @entity133 of the @entity134			0
@entity135 , the man who broke the color barrier in the @entity137 , played there during high school before joining the @entity133			0
several other professional baseball teams played in the 10,000 - seat venue , which also hosted football , boxing , auto racing , track and field meets , international soccer and concerts			1
the facility has been vacant since 1997 when a lack of upkeep forced local schools to stop using it			0
also referred to as @entity127 , it was named a @entity154 this year			0
@entity129 representatives have introduced legislation to have it included as part of @entity158			0
@entity159 , @entity160 the decision to vacate @entity159 in @entity160 was controversial from the start -- and despite making the list of @entity126 in 1989 , multiple efforts failed to save it			2
@entity159 opened on the same day in 1912 as @entity166 in @entity167 , and professional baseball was first played on the site in 1896			1
the @entity170 moved to @entity171 after the end of the 1999 season , but demolition did n't begin until 2008 , taking more than a year to complete			0
the baseball diamond is still there , maintained for the last three years by group of volunteer weekend warriors named the @entity180 , after one of the stadium 's previous monikers			1
the @entity184 , @entity80 the @entity184 opened in 1976 and was home to the @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189			0
in 1994 , the building started crumbling , when ceiling tiles fell from the roof , forcing the @entity186 to play several games at the @entity194			2
the @entity187 moved to @entity195 in july of 1999			0
the facility was demolished in 2000 and the @entity186 returned to the @entity194 for two years before moving into to @entity197 in 2002			0
the venue was considered hideous by many and the movement to save the @entity184 was primarily financially based , as taxpayers still owed $ 125 million when it was demolished in 2000			2
still , notable athletes played there , such as former @entity5 rep. @entity204 , a @entity206 receiver for the @entity186 , and @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 , who all starred for the @entity187 .			2

@entity25 is the only venue in the @entity5 built to watch boat racing
the building that housed @entity102 's @entity101 dates back to the late 19th century
the opening of the @entity60 forever changed @entity5 sports venues
@entity159 is gone , but volunteers still maintain the baseball diamond
