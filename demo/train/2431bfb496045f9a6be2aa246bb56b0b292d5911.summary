@entity0 -- while an estimated 10,000 women are victims of human trafficking in @entity0 's capital , there were only 40 investigations of the crime and three convictions in the city last year , according to a report issued this week			1
the discrepancy is an " alarming figure " that shows a need to improve laws and policies , according to a study on human trafficking and sexual exploitation from @entity0 's human rights commission , which calls the phenomenon a " new form of slavery			1
" " the authorities are not investigating , nor are they asking witnesses , " said @entity23 , investigation coordinator at the @entity24 for @entity26 and cultural studies , one of the partners of the study			2
cultural norms and social stigma prevent people from realizing that many prostitutes lingering in dark alleys of @entity0 are victims , officials said as they presented the report wednesday			2
" they are seen as people who are doing it freely			0
that is the first obstacle to justice , " @entity39 said			0
more on modern - day slavery : the @entity44 authorities in @entity0 announced monday that they had rescued 62 victims of a forced - prostitution ring -- including a 13 - year - old girl			1
five men and two women who police say ran the ring were arrested after an investigation that started when a minor involved reported the suspects to authorities			0
one victim told investigators that she was forced into prostitution in @entity0 after meeting two men in @entity60 , a city more than 460 kilometers ( 288 miles ) away			2
" after chatting with her , the victim told him that she was a domestic worker and the accused offered her a more comfortable life with well - paid work , and in a second encounter he convinced her to come live with him , " the statement said			0
such approaches are a common tactic for those involved in human trafficking , who frequently target women and girls in smaller cities outside the capital , @entity39 said			0
in the southern border state of @entity80 , @entity78 women are frequently a target , @entity39 said			0
but regardless of where victims are recruited , she said , they often pass through -- or end up -- in @entity0 , a sprawling metropolis of more than 21 million people			2
" in one case , 107 trafficking victims , both @entity87 and foreign citizens , were freed from a factory disguised as a drug rehabilitation center in @entity0 ; many of them had been kidnapped , and all were subjected to forced labor , " according to 2010 report on human trafficking from the @entity97			1
the @entity97 report noted that authorities had conducted raids on brothels suspected in human trafficking and a special prosecutor for trafficking in @entity0 sentenced one offender to 10 years in prison last year , " the first sentence under @entity0 's federal anti-trafficking law and @entity0 's local anti-trafficking law			1
" but more needs to be done , this week 's human rights commission report said			1
" the high number of women who are victims of human trafficking are not achieving access to judicial resources and because of this , the large majority of these incidents remain in impunity			0
... their rights remain unprotected , " it said			1
