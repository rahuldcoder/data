-- feasting on turkey aside , brace yourself for that other @entity4 ritual : joining a nationwide mad dash to make it to a family gathering and back in a journey that can exasperate even the most seasoned traveler			1
if you 're flying for the holiday , expect lots of company and few airfare deals			2
" the airlines have eliminated tens of thousands of seats due to consolidation and just plain old capacity cuts and ( they 're ) using smaller planes , " said @entity14 , president of @entity15			2
" so there are going to be fewer seats			2
" it 's also a bit trickier to book flights for @entity4 than @entity26 because so many travelers want to fly in such a small window of time : four days versus two weeks for many people who save vacation time for the big holiday in december			1
the sputtering economy is n't keeping @entity34 from making the annual trek for @entity4 , said @entity36 , contributing editor for @entity37			1
those who will be flying over the holiday will pay $ 376 on average for a domestic ticket , or about 4 % more than at the same time last year , according to @entity37			1
here are five tips to make your journey a smoother one			2
book your tickets now last - minute sales are n't likely for one of the most popular times of the year to fly and seat maps are filling up quickly			2
" do n't delay : prices are not going to go down between now and @entity4 , " @entity36 said			2
" not only do you have a better chance of getting lower airfare , but also ( better ) seats			0
you can book your seat when you book your airfare			0
so if you do n't want to be in the middle of the last row -- the early bird gets the window seat in that case			0
" if you 're flying with someone for @entity4 , the chances of sitting together on the plane are also higher if you book early , @entity14 said			1
look into alternate airports sometimes , it pays to look into flying in and out of airports that may be less convenient than your closest option			0
so you may find a cheaper flight out of @entity72 , @entity73 , than @entity74 , for example , @entity14 said			0
be especially flexible if you 're in a major city like @entity77 , where there are several airports in the area , @entity36 said			0
@entity37 allows fliers to search alternate airports when they 're pricing itineraries			2
consider flying on @entity4 travelers who choose to fly out on the monday before @entity4 and fly back on the sunday after will pay on average $ 213 more than travelers who fly on @entity4 and come back the next day , @entity37 calculated			1
flying on the holiday also means much less crowded airports and planes			0
" have your turkey and then come back on friday , " @entity14 advised			0
lest you think it 's impossible to do , @entity14 assured that plenty of travelers have successfully gone this route , " especially if they do n't like their family or if they 're sleeping on the sofa and the sleeping arrangements are n't comfortable , " he said with tongue in cheek			0
in general , avoid a sunday return , @entity37 advised			1
if you are flying on @entity4 , try to take the first flight out to make sure you make it to dinner			1
give yourself plenty of time connecting flights are often cheaper , but with the possibility of winter weather causing delays or cancellations over @entity4 , you risk a missed connection , @entity14 said			1
he suggests travelers fly nonstop whenever possible , but if you do choose a multistop itinerary , allow lots of time to catch your next flight			0
if you miss a connection , @entity37 warns that with planes booked solid , it could be a while before your airline is able to book you on another flight			1
consider paying some extra fees to make the trip more comfortable @entity14 frequently flies @entity124 and he always pays a fee for seats with extra legroom , an option that comes with access to expedited security lanes and early boarding			1
the choices vary by airlines , but several , including @entity34 and @entity134 , let you board early for a fee , thus helping you avoid the epic struggle for overhead bin space			0
it may be worth paying this extra charge during peak travel times , like @entity4 , to make the journey saner , @entity14 said			1
another , more expensive option is to splurge for an airport lounge day pass , which can cost $ 30 - $ 50			1
" if you only fly once a year , sometimes the day passes are worthwhile , especially if your flight is delayed , " @entity14 said			0
" they have free drinks in most of the lounges , snacks and shorter lines if you have to rebook your flight			0
... it just makes the whole experience a bit more pleasant when you treat yourself well and get the perks			0
