@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 officials sat down monday with the @entity5 and other countries trying to put the brakes on @entity9 's nuclear program , a day after @entity4 announced it is self - sufficient in the nuclear fuel cycle			1
there was " an exchange of views and concerns , " between the @entity4 and envoys from the five permanent members of the @entity17 , plus @entity18 , a diplomatic source familiar with the talks told @entity2			2
the @entity4 nuclear program was the main issue on the table , the source said			1
@entity4 has previously said it did not want the talks to focus on that			0
@entity4 also raised some of its concerns , the source said , including attacks on two @entity4 scientists in @entity9 last week that left one dead and one injured			0
the diplomatic source and a @entity34 official later both told @entity2 that the talks had ended for the day and would resume tuesday			1
the @entity5 and other countries fear that @entity4 wants to develop nuclear weapons , an allegation @entity9 has always denied			2
the meeting in @entity1 is between @entity4 on the one hand and the so - called @entity40 plus 1 group -- the @entity5 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity18 , @entity44 and @entity45 -- on the other			1
but bilateral talks also are going on , the diplomatic source said , refusing to say who was talking to whom			0
the source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations			0
the talks are going on behind closed doors and no public statements have been made so far			0
they 'll continue tuesday , the source said			0
and the @entity40 plus 1 nations are prepared to offer more talks if the @entity4 agree to focus seriously on the nuclear issue			0
the group has been meeting intermittently , with the last round of talks coming over a year ago			2
@entity65 , a spokesman for the @entity66 , said sunday the talks would try " to underscore the concern of the entire international community in @entity4 's actions and intentions			1
" @entity4 already faces stiff sanctions from the international community , because it has continued to enrich uranium			0
with the political barbs flying back and forth regularly , tensions were raised even further last monday when bombers targeted two @entity4 nuclear scientists			1
@entity4 blamed @entity77 , the @entity5 and the @entity45 's spy agencies for the attacks , which killed @entity80 and injured @entity81			1
but @entity82 , the head of @entity4 's @entity83 , told state - run @entity84 on sunday that the " assassination of @entity4 scientists will not hamper our progress			1
" @entity82 also said that @entity4 is now producing yellowcake , meaning its nuclear program is self - sufficient since it now produces everything needed to make nuclear fuel			1
he said the yellowcake came from the @entity95 mine near @entity96 , on @entity4 's southern coast near the @entity98			2
it 's not clear that @entity4 actually has the technology to complete the entire nuclear fuel cycle , despite sunday 's announcement			0
but @entity5 officials were n't surprised by the announcement , with @entity65 saying , " @entity4 has been trying to develop an indigenous program for years given that the import of yellowcake is banned by @entity17 resolutions			2
" he said the move raises further concerns about the @entity113 country 's intentions , " given that @entity4 's own supply of uranium is not enough for a peaceful nuclear energy program			1
