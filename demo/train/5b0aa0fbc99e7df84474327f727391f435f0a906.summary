-- anyone that bikes dreams of riding a @entity3			0
@entity4 , a set of wheel - mounted leds , now makes that dream a little closer to reality , and a new built - in version is helping that system become even more lightweight and simple than the original bolt - on setup			1
the white - and - red lighting comprises a ring of leds that you install around the entire edge of each of your bike rims			1
using a pair of clever devices , only the forward - facing lights ( or backwards , in the case of the rear wheel ) illuminate when the wheel spins			1
the result is beautiful arcs of light that make you visible from all angles , an effect that @entity4 ' co-founder and cfo @entity31 says came by accident			0
revolights inventor @entity33 did n't set out to produce the arcs , instead he was looking for a better headlight design , one that would make obstacles stand out more clearly though low angle lighting			1
the timed blinking of the lights was to prevent them from shining in a rider 's eyes			2
" it was n't until after he had created the first prototype that we realized the huge increase in rider visibility that came with it , " @entity31 says , " he then quickly made a red taillight to match			2
" the lights use two mechanisms to tell the leds when to turn on and off			2
at low speeds , an accelerometer determines the position of the lights by reading the pull of gravity			0
at higher velocities , the lights switch over to calculating speed based on the wheel 's period of rotation			1
that allows the system to synchronize a cascading led pattern			0
this is @entity4 ' second @entity72 campaign			2
the first one was completed in 2011 , raising five times its initial goal			1
@entity31 says this second @entity72 is being done to celebrate the release of a v2 version of the product			2
interestingly , the revamped @entity80 v2.0 kits are n't one of the @entity72 rewards			2
" @entity83 represents our second product , designed with the goal of making @entity4 more accessible , " says @entity31			0
" and while it is a new product we now offer , @entity80 is an aftermarket kit you install on your own wheels , and we felt putting it on @entity72 would be too similar to our last campaign			1
" so they went bigger			0
the current @entity72 is for custom wheels with the lights built right in			1
it 's a project created in partnership with @entity96 ( also a @entity72 alum )			1
" we designed @entity99 to address our largest design challenges : installation and compatibility , " says @entity31			0
" while many cyclists enjoy their existing wheels and want to put @entity4 on them , there 's a whole other group of riders out there that do n't want to install their own lights			1
" it 's a smart way of using @entity72			0
for simple product updates , there 's no need ( and indeed some discouragement ) for using @entity72			0
but by putting together an ambitious product for the crowd funding site and timing that to coincide with an update of your more stable product , you get the best of both worlds as a creator			0

revolights are a set of wheel - mounted leds which increase cycle visibility
the project raised five times the goal funding on @entity72 in 2011
now the team is looking to @entity72 again to develop wheels with in - built lights
the lights are timed to blink depending on the speed the bike goes , preventing them from *blinding* riders
