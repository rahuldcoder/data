-- in the first truly shocking box office result of the year , " @entity5 " sped away from expectations to gross a humongous $ 72.5 million , according to early estimates from @entity4			1
@entity6 stars in " @entity5 , " which exceeded expectations after taking in $ 72.5 million			1
that result is effectively double what most industry observers had predicted for the debut of the fourth feature in @entity14 's car franchise , and it left in the dust a number of notable records : - best april opening ever , beating " @entity18 's " $ 42.2 million			1
- @entity19 opening ever ( three - day ) , beating " @entity20 : @entity21 's " $ 72.1 million			1
- @entity22 opening ever , beating " @entity23 ' " $ 50.5 million			1
- best opening yet in 2009 , easily beating the bows of the more - buzzed - about " @entity26 " ( $ 59.3 million ) and " @entity27 " ( $ 55.2 million )			2
- best opening ever for stars @entity14 , @entity6 , @entity30 , and @entity31 , as well as for director @entity32			0
oh , and let 's not forget that it was the best opening ever for a car - themed movie ! ( beating " cars ' " $ 60.1 million			2
) this outcome is impressive , indeed , something that has caught @entity40 by surprise and has the potential to really change things up -- like when summer-esque blockbusters are released ( rarely does one open so early in the year ) and like , you know , what everyone thinks of @entity14			0
the film did it all on the strength of a solid @entity52 review from an audience that was 57 percent male and 59 percent over age 25			0
like the jaw - dropping early - year debuts of " @entity58 " and " 300 " before it , this is a history - making premiere that you may well be hearing about for a long time to come			0
so , yeah , i almost forgot to mention : " @entity5 " was the no. 1 movie at the box office this weekend			1
coming in strong at no. 2 was " @entity26 , " which dropped a respectable 44 percent to earn $ 33.5 million			2
in 10 days , the @entity66 extravaganza has banked $ 105.7 million			0
" @entity68 " ( no. 3 with $ 9.6 million ) , " knowing " ( no. 4 with $ 8.1 million ) , and " @entity69 " ( no. 5 with $ 7.9 million ) rounded out the top five			0
and the weekend 's other big new release , " @entity71 , " struggled with $ 6 million at no. 6			0
overall , the box office was up a monstrous 68 percent from the same frame a year ago , when holdover 21 outplayed a number of weak new movies , none of which had @entity14 ... whom you 're going to start hearing a lot about , once again			1
