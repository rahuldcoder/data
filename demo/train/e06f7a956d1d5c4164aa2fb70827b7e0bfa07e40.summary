editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity19 does n't just want to live underwater : he wants anyone to join him			1
and he 's determined to make that a reality within a decade			1
@entity19 joined @entity22 as a bioengineer in the mid ' 80s , just as the manned space program was starting to thunder forward			1
but rather than looking up to the stars , he began looking down - deep down			0
as a developer of the agency 's @entity28 , which monitors the safety for all off - planet habitation pursuits , @entity26 soon became a lead proponent of research on an idea being floated by @entity22 at the time : using the sea as a testbed for space exploration			1
before long , this homegrown explorer would become one of the country 's leading proponents of undersea habitation , and an advocate for what he calls the " space - ocean analog			1
" an aquanaut and @entity49 on seven @entity22 underwater missions , @entity26 has also pursued landmark research in bioengineering and become a prolific writer of science books and sci - fi novels			1
but it was his work for @entity22 that resulted in his harvesting of the first agricultural crop in a manned habitat on the sea floor , and led to his designing and construction of the @entity65 , a two man undersea habitat off @entity68			1
the little permanent submarine has been visited by a range of curious futurist explorers , including @entity72 and tv producer @entity73 , @entity74 see the rest of the aquatic life of @entity19 at @entity9 @entity19 's next goal , he explains in this episode of @entity80 : colonizing the sea			1
to move humans to an underwater " @entity83 , " as he calls the habitable regions of the ocean , he launched the @entity86 , which are attempting to build the first underwater settlement for permanent human colonization			2
this is n't a glossy sci - architectural lark or a toe - dip			0
starting with the premise that nearly three quarters of our planet 's largest biome have long remained invisible - and are increasingly endangered - the @entity98 project seeks " a human colony whose primary purpose it is to monitor and protect this most essential of all the earth 's biomes			2
soon , beneath the sea , families will live and work			0
children will go to school			0
a new generation of children will be born there - the first citizens of a new ocean civilization whose most important purpose will be to continuously monitor and protect the global ocean environment			0
" set to commence by next year , the first expedition will be initiated by the submersion of the @entity117 , a small underwater habitat that can house up to four people			0
he 's not only certain that the colonization of the ocean floor is imminent ; he 's making it happen .			0

@entity19 *aspires* to make undersea human habitation a reality
