@entity2 a @entity1 tribunal censured a @entity1 intelligence agency friday for not making enough information public about how it shares @entity8 surveillance data with its @entity10 counterpart , the @entity12			1
the @entity13 said that the intelligence agency known as @entity15 , or @entity15 , had not been open enough about the way the process worked until december			1
the tribunal 's ruling was in response to a complaint brought by civil liberties groups @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 in the wake of claims by former @entity12 contractor @entity28 about mass @entity10 surveillance programs such as @entity31			0
@entity28 's revelations led to questions over @entity15 's sharing of surveillance data with the @entity10			1
" today 's landmark ruling is the first time the @entity13 -- which considers complaints brought against @entity15 , @entity41 and @entity42 -- has found against the intelligence agencies in its 15 - year history , " @entity23 said in a statement , referring also to @entity1 's other two intelligence agencies			1
" @entity23 disagrees that the limited safeguards revealed are sufficient to make @entity15 's mass surveillance and intelligence - sharing activities lawful , and will challenge the @entity13 's december decision at the @entity49			1
" @entity24 also hailed what it said was a " major victory " in the battle to rein in the intelligence agencies ' activities			0
friday 's judgment " represents a monumental leap forward in efforts to make intelligence agencies such as @entity15 and @entity12 accountable to the millions of individuals whose privacy they have violated , " it said			1
the tribunal ruled on december 5 that the sharing of electronic surveillance data between the two countries was lawful			2
but it said friday that only after that date was enough information about the program in the public domain -- thanks to the disclosures made in the case -- for the @entity1 government not to contravene its @entity75 human rights obligations			1
at issue are articles 8 and 10 of the @entity78 , or @entity49 , regarding the rights to privacy and to freedom of expression			0
before december 5 , " the regime governing the soliciting , receiving , storing and transmitting by @entity1 authorities of private communications of individuals located in the @entity1 , which have been obtained by @entity10 authorities ... , contravened @entity89 8 or 10 @entity49 , but now complies , " the tribunal 's ruling stated			1
the @entity92 said the ruling vindicated the intelligence agencies ' actions			1
" today 's judgment reaffirms the ( tribunal ) 's earlier ruling , which found that the current regime governing both the intelligence agencies ' external interception and intelligence sharing regimes are lawful and @entity49 compliant , " a government spokesman said			2
" those activities have always been subject to strict safeguards			0
this judgment is about the amount of detail about those safeguards that needed to be in the public domain			0
the ( tribunal ) has made clear that no further action is required			0
" the government is " committed to transparency " and has now made public the detail of the safeguards governing requests made to foreign governments for intercepted communications , he added			1
the @entity13 is an independent body set up to investigate complaints about the alleged conduct of public bodies with regard to members of the public			2
it deals with complaints about the use of intrusive powers such as wiretapping by intelligence services , law enforcement agencies and public authorities			2
@entity137 , deputy director of @entity24 , said that despite friday 's ruling , more needed to be done to protect the @entity1 public 's rights			0
" we must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programs using secret interpretations of secret laws			0
the world owes @entity28 a great debt for blowing the whistle , and today 's decision is a vindication of his actions			0
" but more work needs to be done			0
the only reason why the @entity12 - @entity15 sharing relationship is still legal today is because of a last - minute clean - up effort by government to release previously secret ' arrangements			2
' that is plainly not enough to fix what remains a massive loophole in the law			0

@entity13 says that until december , @entity15 was too secretive about how it shared data
this meant @entity1 intelligence agency contravened @entity75 law on right to privacy
@entity1 @entity92 says government is committed to transparency and complies with law
