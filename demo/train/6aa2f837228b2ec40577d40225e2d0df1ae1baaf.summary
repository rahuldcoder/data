-- @entity2 's central bank president was removed from his post by presidential decree , a possible final blow in a political standoff between the banker and the executive			2
@entity2 president @entity13 's decree on thursday removed @entity15 president @entity14 from his post for " misconduct and dereliction of duty by a public servant , " the state - run @entity10 news agency reported			1
but @entity14 may not go easily			2
because of the decree , the central bank chief and his supporters were " already analyzing all available legal measures " to maintain his post , a central bank official familiar with the developments told @entity0 en @entity27			0
the source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue			0
earlier this week , the president announced she had accepted @entity14 's resignation after the bank chief declined to support a plan to use $ 6.5 billion in reserves to pay the country 's debt			1
@entity14 retorted that he had not resigned , and that only the @entity38 , not the president , could remove him			1
opposition politicians advised @entity14 not to abide by the decree and to seek an injunction to protect his rights , the central bank source said			0
the dispute appeared to stem from a government plan to use $ 6.5 billion in reserves from the @entity15 to pay down debt , something that the central bank , as an independent body , declined to do			1
according to @entity14 , the proposal should be studied to see if such a request should come from the congress , rather than the nation 's president			1
@entity14 's current term ends in september			1
@entity58 , a professor at @entity59 in @entity2 , said the outcome of the power struggle between @entity14 and @entity62 could set a precedent of how @entity2 deals with increasing government expenditures in the face of low government revenue			2
public spending is higher than government revenue in @entity2 , creating the need to turn to the country 's central bank			0
however , @entity58 told @entity72 that decisions to draw money from the central bank must come from congress , rather than presidential decree			0
" the most important thing here is that there is a overstepping by the executive , in violation of central bank autonomy , " he said .			0
