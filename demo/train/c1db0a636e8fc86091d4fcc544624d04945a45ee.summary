@entity0 -- some conservatives unhappy with @entity5 speaker @entity4 's leadership are looking for a replacement , and recent moves by @entity10 @entity9 @entity8 are fueling speculation he wants @entity4 's job in the next @entity13			1
@entity8 , who was part of @entity4 's leadership team two years ago but left to chair the @entity17 , gave an expansive speech last week hosted by @entity19 , a group that frequently and publicly clashes with @entity4			1
asked afterward if he was interested in running for speaker , @entity8 initially said he was " flattered , " and said , " it 's not something i 've aspired to			1
it 's not something i 'm thinking about			2
" but then he left the door open , saying , " no , i have n't been shermanesque , again i 'm not sure there 's any opportunity i want to foreclose			1
" while @entity19 's chief executive officer @entity28 told @entity1 that his group does n't get involved in leadership races , the conservative group gave @entity8 a high - profile platform to outline his own conservative philosophy for governing			1
@entity28 said there is a " real need to take on sacred cows in @entity0 at time when the party too often looks after @entity39 , " a reference to the downtown @entity0 address for corporate lobbyists			0
he said , " @entity8 is a great spokesman and fighter for conservative values			2
" @entity4 has said he 's staying put @entity4 , in his 12th term in @entity13 and in his second as speaker , continues to insist he 's not going anywhere and expects to remain in charge next year			1
but he raised questions earlier this month when he would n't commit to serving out another full term as speaker			0
at the beginning of the current @entity13 in january 2013 , a dozen @entity5 @entity9 members voted for someone other than @entity4 , or voted " present , " an expression of no confidence			2
many in that small group are convinced @entity4 wo n't run for his post after this year 's midterms or that he wo n't have the votes to keep that title			2
if @entity4 decides to step down from the position , @entity5 majority leader @entity64 is popular among conservatives , and most expect him to move up and take the speaker 's gavel			1
in that scenario conservatives could wage an effort to fill in top @entity5 @entity9 posts			0
@entity4 on the establishment and the tea party @entity76 -- some who voted for @entity4 in 2013 and some who did n't -- praised @entity8 as a solid conservative , but also told @entity1 there 's a short list of others who are viable candidates			1
many @entity83 interviewed by @entity1 declined to talk openly about potential leadership challenges , but admitted there are informal discussions about options			0
the names repeatedly raised include @entity90 @entity9 @entity89 , who like @entity8 is a former chairman of the fiscally conservative @entity91 ; @entity93 @entity92 rep. @entity92 , who currently heads that group ; and @entity96 rep. @entity95 , another former study group leader who also served in @entity4 's leadership team in the last @entity13			1
" the one consensus point is that we 'd like to see more conservatives in future leadership posts , " @entity93 @entity9 @entity98 told @entity1			2
but he cautioned for now there 's no single alternative emerging to @entity4 -- or anyone who might want to challenge the speaker 's current top lieutenants -- @entity64 and @entity9 whip @entity108			1
he said he expected more serious discussions to ramp up by the end of the summer			0
@entity8 's recent speech at @entity19 may be a way to ensure his name gets in the mix. the @entity10 @entity9 used the speech to position himself firmly on the right			1
he called out his own party for breaking with its free market roots , arguing that the party should be shifting away from policies designed to help big business and the well - connected and instead champion policies to help the " @entity124 competitive economy			0
" the thrust of @entity8 's speech lines up with the message many on the right flank of the @entity5 @entity9 conference have been pushing			1
@entity131 @entity9 @entity130 has publicly criticized @entity5 @entity9 leaders for pushing a legislative agenda that positions the @entity9 as the " party of big business " and does n't resonate with small businesses and entrepreneurs			0
challenging the party @entity8 argued those on @entity124 are " not looking for a subsidy , earmark , tax preference or legislated advantage			2
" on a series of issues -- tax reform , farm policy , reform of mortgage giants @entity149 and @entity150 -- @entity8 challenged his party to hold votes on legislation that would restructure current federal systems			2
the bulk of @entity8 's ire was directed at the @entity157 , the 80 - year - old credit agency that gives out loans to companies to promote @entity161 exports			1
the bank 's lending authority is due to expire at the end of the year			0
@entity8 defended 2013 @entity9 shutdown strategy @entity8 held it up as the poster child of corporate welfare , citing that the vast majority of its taxpayer backed loans go to companies like aircraft manufacturing giant @entity175			0
he said getting rid of the bank " is a defining issue for our party and our movement			0
" if @entity8 or anyone else is serious about mounting a challenge , the @entity83 that @entity1 interviewed all agree that if they are serious they need to move soon			0
" it seems to me that the odds of there being some type of change within the leadership team seem to be more likely than less , and so as long as there are members talking about it it 's better to do so early than late , " @entity184 @entity183 rep. @entity183 told @entity1			0
@entity196 @entity195 rep. @entity195 , who opposed @entity4 in the last election , told @entity1 that he hears from republicans in his district that it 's time for a leadership change in @entity0			2
" there is a great deal of frustration , " @entity195 said			0
he was n't sure if @entity8 or someone else was the right fit , but said a successful campaign required several months or preparation			0
a few months ago unhappiness about @entity4 's handling of government spending fights and concern he would negotiate with @entity213 on a major immigration bill roiled the conference			1
but because members are n't coalescing around a single alternative , the vacuum gives @entity4 some job security for now			0
@entity98 said tension is down between conservatives and @entity4 because the speaker agreed to form a select committee on the deadly @entity225 terror attack and hold a @entity5 vote that held former @entity228 official @entity227 in contempt for the controversy around her agency 's targeting of conservative groups			1
he said " there are less things that divide us -- but the one question would be immigration			0

@entity4 has been speaker since 2011 and has said he 's not going anywhere
@entity8 says he 's flattered by the attention , but is not thinking about being speaker
but he 's leaving the door open as some conservatives have been unhappy with @entity4 's leadership
