-- on sunday , pope @entity1 and pope @entity2 were canonized as saints of the @entity4			1
this event clearly has intense significance for @entity4 , but what about everyone else ? why should non-catholics even care ? both men are widely popular among the laity , and the ceremony drew an enormous crowd			1
both men also have critics			2
some conservative @entity4 still work to roll back the reforms of the @entity17 called forth by @entity2			1
many @entity4 strongly critique @entity1 's centralizing tendencies and catastrophic response to all the sex abuse scandals			1
for @entity4 , however , saints do n't have to be perfect			1
in fact , @entity4 are inspired by the ability of saints to do good despite their human flaws			1
the process of canonization concentrates devotion on the best features of a historical person			2
in 1903 , long before @entity2 was elected @entity2 , he wrote about each saint being " holy in a different way			1
" these differences enhance , rather than detract , the importance of saints			2
so what might non-catholics take away from this ? first , both saints offer a model of risk - taking based on a strong sense of moral purpose			1
second , one could learn a lot about what 's going on with the billion or so @entity4 in the world today			1
the dual canonizations , it turns out , symbolize an attempt to turn the church away from decades of infighting and turf wars and toward a mission for the common good			1
@entity55 , associate professor of philosophy of religion at @entity58 , said , " it should matter to us when our neighbors announce that they have designated new moral exemplars			2
" if our neighbors tell us a new story about their ideals , heroes and models for their own lives , then " we have an interest in watching and even in helping our neighbors to tell that story in a way that is beneficial			0
" beneficial -- but how ? @entity73 , vice president for @entity74 at @entity75 in @entity76 , suggested that we all might be inspired by their risk - taking			1
both men , she said , " moved through the world discerning where , when and how to act without fear			2
the possibilities of their lives were not constricted by desires for wealth , power or honor			0
that freedom makes way for the pursuit of truth , justice and love			0
" @entity73 cites @entity1 's work against communist oppression in @entity96 and @entity2 's efforts to " free the entire church from the fear of modernism			1
" nonbelievers can , if they choose , admire these examples of courage and action without believing that the two men have a special status in heaven or endorsing everything that they did			0
in that framework , the process of canonization crystallizes the memory of the two popes around their best deeds			0
the canonizations , though , do more than provide strong examples of moral courage			2
they reveal something very important about the aspirations of @entity122 for the role of the @entity4 in the world			2
according to @entity4 belief , popes do not make people into saints ; @entity129 does			1
@entity130 , an all - too human practice , is the process of recognizing divinely given sanctity			0
as @entity135 has written , ideally this is a deeply democratic process , with devotion to a holy person flowing upward from the laity to the hierarchy			0
@entity130 provides an opportunity to shape memory			0
people become recognized as saints , in part , through storytelling , a topic i study as an historian of the @entity149			0
when we choose what stories to tell about a person , we reveal a lot about ourselves , our hopes and fears , the ways in which we might try to do better personally , and the kinds of changes we 'd like to see in the world			0
that 's been true since the early centuries of @entity163 , a period in which sainthood was generally bestowed by local and regional communities without any broader oversight from church authorities			0
if a group of people believed that someone was a saint , and they set up shrines , venerated relics , developed rituals and told stories about miracles -- then that person was a saint			0
during the @entity149 , the papacy asserted ever - increasing control over the process of who got to tell the stories of saints			2
while the vox populi still matters , next sunday is pope @entity122 ' show			0
the symbolism of the twin canonizations is so powerful , in fact , that the editorial board of the @entity188 reacted to the announcement last july by declaring that truly " the pontificate of @entity122 has begun			0
" @entity192 , author of several popular books about saints , suggested that by linking the canonizations , @entity122 is trying to start a new narrative			0
@entity192 said , " the internal @entity4 cultural wars and polarization have increasingly embittered a lot of the internal life of the church			1
overcoming some of those divisions and synthesizing some of the best and noblest features of these two popes by joining them , is a hopeful sign for anyone who is concerned about the future of humanity			0
" if the canonizations of @entity212 @entity2 and @entity1 can inspire more of us , as individuals , to find a moral purpose and take risks , our lives will be better for it			1
if the canonizations can help lead the @entity4 away from bitter division and toward taking powerful moral positions on the world stage , especially following @entity122 ' focus on poverty and inequality , we 'll all be better for it .			1

pope @entity1 and pope @entity2 were canonized as saints
@entity228 : this is significant for @entity4 , but non-catholics should care too
he says both men offer a model of risk - taking based on a strong sense of moral purpose
@entity228 : canonization is an attempt to turn the church away from decades of infighting
