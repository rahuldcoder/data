-- @entity1 , the last native speaker of a dialect originating from a remote fishing village in northern @entity4 , has died -- and so has the dialect he spoke			1
the death of the 92 - year - old retired engineer means that the @entity9 dialect known as @entity11 fisherfolk is now consigned to a collection of brief , distorted audio clips			1
it is the first unique dialect to be lost in @entity4 , according to @entity15 , a reader in linguistics at the @entity17 at @entity18			1
" usually minority dialects end up blending in with standard @entity20 to form a hybrid			1
however , this is a completely distinct dialect which has become extinct , " he said			1
@entity11 fisherfolk appears to be the only descendant from the @entity26 linguistic world in which no " wh " pronunciation existed , @entity15 said			1
" ' what ' would become ' at ' and ' where ' would just be ' ere ' , " he said			2
it was also the @entity9 language 's only dialect that dropped the " @entity34 " aspiration			1
a history of invented languages " the loss of @entity11 is symptomatic of a greater , general decline in the use of the @entity9 language , " according to @entity42 @entity41			1
" this should be a wake - up call to save other struggling dialects			2
" ten miles down the coast from @entity11 is @entity46 , another sleepy fishing village with the closest surviving dialect to @entity11 fisherfolk , one that may also be endangered , according to @entity41			1
" it looks more than likely that this will go the same way as the @entity11 dialect , " he said			1
the dialect of the peoples who originally resided on the shores of @entity11 -- which lies on the tip of @entity61 peninsula , a four - hour drive north of @entity63 -- was directly linked to their traditional fishing methods			1
however , during the industrialization of fishing in the 1950s , established working methods were lost and the connection between the way of life and the dialect eroded			1
in fewer than 30 years , much of the dialect became obsolete			1
@entity15 argues that the decline in @entity9 language represents a wider global trend			2
" generally , in the literate world , local dialects are suffering			2
the highly mobile and technologically advanced areas of the world are worst affected , " he said			2
there are some 6,000 to 7,000 languages in the world and it is estimated that they are disappearing at a rate of one every two weeks , according to @entity15			2
some 96 % of the world 's population speak just 4 % of the world 's languages , he said			2
" most languages are only spoken by a few hundred people , " he added			2
why mourn the loss of a language ? " at a banal level , it 's a little bit of color in our lives is gone , " he said			1
" any time something dies , it 's lost			1
whether it be languages or species , we lose something			2
everyone in the world loses something			0
diversity surely is a good thing , and we 've just lost a bit of it			1
" greater communication and interdependence among communities is resulting in " dialect homogenization , " @entity15 said			1
and people tend to abandon their own languages for one of the larger languages for good reasons , according to @entity119 , professor of linguistics at @entity121 and director of the school 's @entity123			0
" they want modern conveniences ; they want their children to have decent jobs , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			0
" all this requires being able to speak in the dominant language			0
so they see little use in preserving their languages			0
" but the loss of a language often results in the loss of the stories that were told in that language , and in the cultural knowledge they contained			0
" even medical know - how , " he said			0
@entity41 , of the @entity42 , maintains that @entity9 minority dialects like @entity11 have faced other pressures			1
" educationally , @entity20 has been the language used in @entity4 since the 18th century			0
consequently , @entity9 speakers are not literate in their own language			0
also , until recently , @entity9 has had a social stigma attached to it as a working - class or second - rate language			0
" yet there are signs of improvement for the state of @entity9 minority dialects			0
more @entity9 books , especially children 's books , are being published than ever before			0
in addition , since 2009 , the @entity4 government has provided funding for the @entity42 , which has also given the language a status boost			0
the support has been seen as a natural progression from the move by @entity167 in 2002 to sign the @entity168 recognizing @entity9 , @entity169 and @entity170 as languages separate from @entity20			0
still , the rate of the worldwide loss of dialects and languages remains consistent			0
@entity41 said he would like to see more efforts taken to safeguard minority @entity9 dialects			0
" @entity9 has an amazing literary history , yet it is completely ignored in our schools , " he said			0
" the books must be made more widely available and read more in schools for the language to survive in the future			0
" how to create a language from scratch @entity0 's @entity188 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 was 92
