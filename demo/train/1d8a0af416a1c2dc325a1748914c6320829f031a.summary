everyone was all smiles when @entity3 first lady @entity2 -- sporting a black coat with a big red ribbon on its lapel -- took center stage at an @entity9 event in @entity10 last month , posing with young volunteers working with awareness groups around the nation			1
@entity2 , a famous folk singer who has been compared to @entity14 , is the glamorous public face of @entity3 's fight against @entity9			1
but campaigners say the photo ops and lofty words offered by @entity2 and other public figures do little to improve the lot of the almost half a million people living with @entity23 or @entity9 in @entity3			1
in 2011 , the same year @entity2 was appointed as a @entity26 goodwill ambassador for @entity9 , @entity24 tested positive for @entity23 , the virus that causes @entity9 , when he was trying to donate blood as a young military officer			1
after the discovery , he says his army bosses ordered him home " to rest			2
" " i worked so hard to get where i was , " he recalled of his promising career in the @entity32 , which had sent him to a military academy for graduate studies			0
" then all of a sudden they just wanted me out because of my @entity23 status			1
" although he still receives a monthly salary from the army , @entity24 -- a pseudonym he uses to protect his identity -- feels his life is in limbo			1
he is no longer welcome in the military but ca n't be transferred to civilian work either			0
former officers normally become civil servants -- a dead end for @entity24 as a physical examination that includes hiv screening is mandatory for government job applicants and hiv - positive candidates are disqualified			1
" if the government itself still discriminates against us , how can it expect the rest of society not to ? " asked the 28 - year old who now volunteers with a @entity10 - based @entity9 advocacy group			2
inconsistency some 430,000 people are living with @entity9 in @entity3 , according to the latest count by the @entity61 on @entity9 ( @entity62 )			1
@entity3 laws and regulations prohibit discrimination against people with @entity23 , but activists cite myriad of real - life examples -- including the exclusion from public sector jobs -- as evidence of inconsistency in the official policy			1
their most recent outcry was triggered by a @entity77 proposal that would bar people with @entity23 from entering bathhouses , including those offering spa and massage services			1
failure to comply would result in fines for the businesses			0
announced in mid-october , the draft regulation appeared to be backed by the public			0
a poll of 10,000 people on a popular @entity89 - like site showed more than 70 % of the respondents supported the ban			2
but it drew immediate fire from many experts and activists who blasted the ministry for lacking basic health knowledge as well as reinforcing public ignorance and prejudice on the issue			0
" @entity23 transmission in a bathhouse or spa setting is not possible , and the use of such facilities by people living with @entity23 poses absolutely no risk from a public health perspective , " the @entity3 office of @entity62 said in a statement			1
" addressing hiv - related stigma and discrimination is a critical component of a successful response to @entity23			1
" protests @entity115 , an activist who is hiv - positive , became so incensed by the proposal that he staged a brief protest outside the ministry shortly after the announcement			2
under the watchful eyes of police and soldiers , @entity115 -- donning a white bathrobe -- held up a sign that asked : " mr. @entity127 , can we go to your house to take a bath ? " " even people knowledgeable of @entity23 's transmission still feel scared because of many half - truths reported by the media , " said the former sound mixer , 22 , still fuming over the proposal 's negative impact on his cause			1
" this government proposal would only make things worse			0
" amid the controversy , the @entity77 pledged to consult experts and review the draft			0
for @entity23 carriers , though , the fight against discrimination remains an uphill battle			2
@entity115 and @entity24 both recounted their difficulty in accessing medical care as many public hospitals still turn away @entity23 - positive patients when they seek treatment for other illnesses			1
some have tried to redress their grievances through the courts			0
in 2010 , a young man in @entity160 sued the local educational authority after his application for a teacher 's position was rejected because of his @entity23 status			1
last month , another hiv - positive man in @entity168 sued local officials , when he was denied a government job despite scoring the highest among all applicants			0
concerted effort in recent years , @entity3 's top leaders have made a concerted effort in recognizing and addressing the country 's growing hiv / aids problem			2
although the total number of cases seems low for a population of 1.3 billion , the government has acknowledged an alarming trend among young people			0
in 2012 , 1,700 @entity3 students were found to be @entity23 - positive , a 25 % jump over the previous year and mostly attributable to same - sex contact , state news agency @entity187 reported			1
last year , president @entity188 visited sufferers at a @entity10 clinic and called them " our brothers and sisters whose lives should be brightened with love from the whole society			0
" " @entity9 is n't terrible in itself , " @entity188 said at the time			2
" what 's really dreadful is the ignorance on @entity9 and the prejudice against @entity9 patients			2
" heartened by the president 's words , many activists nevertheless caution that the challenge is translating the leadership 's gesture into government actions			0
they agree that one top priority should be revamping the country 's inadequate sex education , which they blame for the sharp rise of hiv infections among young people as well as the continued public prejudice against sufferers			0
" we have brought the topic of hiv / aids into schools but we only talk about the harm caused by the disease , " said @entity218 , who tested positive for the virus some 20 years ago and now runs the @entity220 for @entity221			0
" students are taught that only gay or immoral people with multiple sexual partners get infected			0
linking the disease to morality further stigmatizes it -- and that really is the problem			0

laws prohibit discrimination against the 430,000 people living with @entity9 in @entity3
but real - life experiences *suggest* inconsistency in official policy
@entity24 was *kicked* out of the army because of his @entity23 status
