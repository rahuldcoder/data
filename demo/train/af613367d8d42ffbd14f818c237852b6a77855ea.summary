-- the @entity2 @entity1 declined on monday to review an abortion - related appeal , a sign the justices were not eager to jump into the contentious social issue			2
the case dealt with the constitutionality of state " personhood " laws that say life begins at conception , and would give human embryos the rights and privileges of citizens			1
@entity19 is a proposed ballot measure to amend @entity22 's state constitution , but was unanimously struck down by the state 's supreme court			0
those justices said the measure , if approved , would unconstitutionally ban access to abortions , and concluded that defining a fertilized human egg as a person " is clearly unconstitutional			0
" the high court gave no reason why it decided not to review the @entity22 case			0
supporters of the measure believe voters should be given the right to decide an issue like defining life , and said it was unfair for the courts to block the law before it was enacted			1
opponents counter it would essentially block abortions even in cases of rape , incest , or when the mother 's life was in danger			1
they also said it would severely restrict use of contraception and in vitro fertilization			0
a bill similar to @entity22 's is pending in the @entity58 legislature			2
voters in @entity60 and @entity61 have rejected " personhood " ballot initiatives in recent years			1
many backers had hoped to use such " gateway " measures to force another @entity1 showdown over the landmark 1973 @entity69 ruling legalizing abortion			2
the case is @entity22 v. @entity73 ( 12 - 145 ) .			0

case *focused* on " personhood " laws that say life begins at conception , *extend* certain rights to embryos
supporters believe voters should decide issue ; opponents say it would block abortion in most cases
