@entity0 , @entity1 -- sen. @entity4 's visit tuesday to @entity5 proved to be more than the average guest speaker appearance , with the @entity8 presidential candidate giving and getting a dose of the campaign 's trademark " straight talk			1
" while campaigning tuesday with her husband , @entity13 uses crutches after twisting her knee			0
during the question - and - answer session , one student rose and asked a pointed question about @entity4 's age , 71 : " if elected , you 'd be older than @entity21 , making you the oldest president			1
do you ever worry that , like , you might die in office or get @entity24 's or some other disease that might affect your judgment ? " the @entity28 senator chuckled slightly as comments of " @entity30 " filled the room			1
in a self - deprecating reference to his memory , @entity4 said his children have joked about their father " hiding his own @entity37 eggs , " but quickly added that he is a " 24 - 7 " worker and will out - campaign any of his rivals			1
@entity4 ended the exchange in his quintessential style : " thanks for the question , you little jerk			1
" another student then asked @entity4 a question about what he would do for rights for " lgbts " -- lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people			2
@entity4 was confused by the question and acknowledged to the audience that he did not know what the initials meant			2
once the meaning was clarified , @entity4 told sophomore @entity60 he is opposed to any form of discrimination , but he supports the military 's " @entity64 " policy and he opposes same - sex marriage			1
" i believe that the sanctity of marriage between man and woman is unique and should be preserved , and i understand the controversy that swirls around that issue , and that debate needs to be continued to be held , but i support that position , " @entity4 said			1
" you want to take away someone 's rights because you believe it 's wrong , " @entity60 followed up			0
" i do n't put that interpretation on my position , but i understand yours , " @entity4 responded , seeming to enjoy the back and forth			1
" i came here looking to see a good leader			0
i do n't , " @entity60 said before leaving the microphone to some boos and gasps from the audience and an eventual scolding by a school administrator			0
" listen , i understand , " @entity4 told the buzzing crowd			2
that 's what @entity92 is all about , and i appreciate your views			0
" asked later at a news conference , @entity4 said he had never heard the initials " lgbt " before , but knew the phrase			2
@entity99 dominated much of @entity4 's comments before the packed auditorium			1
he reiterated his support for @entity92 strategy there , and played up his criticism of the way the war was handled until recently			0
" i was the only one of the major @entity8 candidates who adamantly , vociferously opposed the [ former defense secretary @entity110 ] @entity112 strategy and fought hard for the strategy [ of using more troops ] that we 're employing today , " he told reporters			2
" the others thought it was fine			0
that 's because they do n't have the knowledge or background and experience that i do on issues of national security			0
that 's a clear indication of it			0
