-- a @entity2 citizen of @entity5 descent was the source of much of the information on a potential " @entity9 - style " terror plot in @entity10 , a @entity2 counterterrorism official said wednesday			1
the man , @entity11 , was detained in @entity12 in july and transferred to @entity14 custody where he has " revealed details about the terror plot , " said the official , who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media			1
the man and several other @entity2 traveled from @entity20 to the @entity5 - @entity22 border area in 2009 , where he joined the @entity24 , an extremist group allied with @entity25 , @entity2 intelligence officials said			1
@entity11 , once captured , " started to talk a lot , " and detailed a " @entity9 - style " attack in @entity10 , the @entity2 official said			1
@entity29 evacuated after bomb threat ten men launched a carefully planned attack on buildings in @entity9 , @entity34 , on november 26 , 2008			2
the attack on such prominent sites -- such as the @entity38 hotel , the @entity40 hotels , the historic @entity42 train station and a @entity44 cultural center -- lasted three days and killed 164 people			0
@entity11 is from @entity20 where he worked for a cleaning company at the @entity20 international airport , the @entity2 official said			2
he attended the @entity49 mosque , formerly known as the @entity51 mosque , in @entity20 , which became known as the meeting place of those behind the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity55 and @entity56			1
among those who prayed there was @entity59 , one of the hijackers who commandeered the first plane that crashed into @entity55 's @entity62			0
@entity11 was part of @entity59 's circle , the official said			2
@entity20 shut down the mosque this year , not long after @entity11 's capture			2
national intelligence director @entity68 would not talk about a plot tuesday evening			0
" we are not going to comment on specific intelligence , as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that are critical to protecting the @entity14 and our allies , " he said			2
" as we have repeatedly said , we know @entity25 wants to attack @entity10 and the @entity14			1
" meanwhile , a federal law enforcement official in the @entity14 , said " the volume seems to be turned up " on the threat information coming out of @entity10			1
the intelligence indicates there is interest in using people with @entity83 passports in an attack , that official said			2
this source says the potential operatives may be a mix of @entity10 and others possibly including @entity89 , @entity22 , @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92			1
there is concern about an " active shooter " scenario that would create as many casualties and as much chaos as possible in a short period of time			0
the @entity9 attacks showed how effective this kind of an attack can be in drawing attention			1
according to this source , economic targets in @entity10 could be possible targets , including institutions such as banks and stock exchanges			0
a separate law enforcement source said " the belief is " that @entity113 signed off on a @entity10 attack plan , and that source confirmed the intelligence related to a @entity9 - style attack			1
the @entity2 government is increasingly concerned about the number of @entity2 becoming jihadists			0
according to a senior @entity2 counterterrorism source , some 200 individuals have traveled to train with @entity124 groups in the @entity5 - @entity22 border region since the 9/11 attacks			1
the potential plot against @entity10 was one factor contributing to the uptick this month in missile strikes by unmanned drones against terrorist targets in @entity22 , according to a @entity14 official			1
" we would be remiss not to try to take action to thwart what might be underway in @entity10 , " said the official			2
the official emphasized that the potential plot was not the sole factor			2
@entity14 officials say they are taking advantage of what they call " precise intelligence			1
" most of the drone attacks this year have been focused on @entity147 , a mountainous area bordering @entity5 where @entity22 security forces have little control			1
that has continued to be the pattern this month			0
based on information from @entity22 officials , @entity0 estimates there have been 20 drone attacks in the area in september alone , a higher number than in any previous month , and more than twice the monthly average			1
acknowledging the spike , one @entity14 official told @entity0 : " our operational tempo has been up for a while now , we have good information driving it , and given the stakes involved , we hope to keep the pressure on as long as we can			0
" according to the official , the mix of threats remains the same			0
it comes from groups like the @entity170 , @entity25 , the @entity5 @entity171 and the @entity22 @entity171			0
the threats they pose are " all deadly , " said the official			0
@entity22 officials say many recent strikes have been aimed at compounds in or around the town of @entity178 , a stronghold of the @entity170			0
western intelligence officials have long regarded the @entity170 as one of the most dangerous terror groups and have linked them to several attacks in @entity12			0
intelligence analysts point to other reasons for the escalated drone attacks			1
they include better information from sources in the border area and better surveillance technology -- including the growing use of spy balloons fitted with high - powered cameras			0
in addition , the rising number of drone strikes is designed to deprive the @entity171 of " strategic depth " as the @entity199 administration 's campaign to defeat the insurgency enters a crucial phase and tighten the noose on the senior @entity25 leadership			0
@entity22 officials say one strike last weekend killed sheikh @entity205 , described as the group 's senior operational commander			0
@entity0 's @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0

man talks about a " @entity9 - style " attack in @entity10 , official says
he attended the same mosque in @entity20 as 9/11 hijacker @entity59
@entity10 plot is one factor in the increase in drone attacks in @entity22
@entity14 officials say they are taking advantage of what they call " precise intelligence "
