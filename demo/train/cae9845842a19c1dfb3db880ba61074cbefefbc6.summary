it is safe to assume that the world reacting to news of @entity4 's latest abductions will be a somewhat disillusioned one			1
such weariness is understandable , considering what has happened in the eight months since the abductions that first brought @entity4 into the global spotlight			1
first it took almost three weeks for the @entity12 president to address the country on the incident			0
in september , " @entity16 " banners appeared on the streets of the @entity12 capital , @entity19 , ostensibly the work of supporters of the president , who had somehow assumed it would be a great idea to make political capital out of the # @entity26 campaign			1
it took a backlash to make the president 's spokesman put out a disclaimer			2
and this week , just before the news of the latest kidnappings broke , a military court in @entity19 convicted 54 @entity12 soldiers on charges of mutiny , and cowardice in the face of @entity4 , and sentenced them to death : a symbolic victory for @entity4 if ever there was one			1
the icing on the cake was the news , in october , of a ceasefire with @entity4			1
military units obeyed the prompting of their commanders			2
by the time it dawned on the world that the ceasefire was a ruse , @entity4 had launched a devastatingly successful offensive , capturing several towns in @entity55 , including the hometown of @entity12 's most senior military officer , chief of defense staff @entity57 , a man given to inopportunely boasting , of the impending end of @entity4			1
today , eight months after the abductions , none of the girls has been rescued			1
the handful of girls who escaped did so on their own , not because a band of special - forces soldiers set them free			0
â€Ž and lest we forget , this week 's incident is not the first since april ; @entity4 has never once let up on its attacks on civilian targets			1
perhaps the most important lesson from the last eight months is this : that outrage , no matter how focused it is , or how much it trends on social media , is not what stops terrorists			1
especially not groups like @entity4 and @entity80 , so steeped in brutality that even @entity82 has been compelled to disavow them			1
the outrage has its uses , no doubt			2
it can help jolt government out of its nonchalance , in the face of several distractions ( like the general elections forthcoming in february , in which president @entity92 will be seeking a second and final term ) , and force it to pay attention to matters like equipping the military			2
at the beginning of december , @entity12 journalist @entity98 toured towns recently liberated from @entity4 by @entity12 troops , and reported an upswing in morale on the part of the @entity12 military			1
outrage can also turn ordinary citizens into crusaders against poor governance , and make them more likely to exercise their voting rights in the quest for something more inspiring			2
but only a demonstration of superior military force will make a lasting difference , and ensure that @entity4 is reduced to a position in which it can no longer routinely carry out these kinds of attacks			1
negotiations will be meaningless ; @entity4 under @entity120 has repeatedly insisted it will not negotiate with the government			1
that superior force will be the result of a combination of factors			0
improved intelligence gathering is one			0
one defining characteristic of the @entity12 military 's moves has been its largely defensive nature			1
it has tended to stay one step behind @entity4 ; occupied mainly with fighting to capture towns seized by @entity4 , instead of preventing @entity4 from seizing the towns in the first place , or abducting civilians			2
" if you do n't have good information you have nothing , " says @entity137 , a retired @entity139 @entity138 , now on the faculty of the @entity141 , in @entity142			0
" good information makes you act in advance , not react			0
" training is another matter			0
the relatively higher rates of success @entity152 appears to be enjoying in its confrontations with @entity4 may in part be due to the training its forces have received from abroad			1
it is not clear if any of the several offers of support that @entity12 received following the april abductions translated into action			0
now would be a good time to revisit them			0
the @entity164 government can also play a role in re-engaging with @entity12 , regarding the sale of game - changing military hardware			0
in recent months the @entity12 government has expressed its frustration with the attitude of the @entity164 , who are wont to insist that they can not supply arms to countries that violate human rights			0
( puzzling when one considers the sort of regimes the @entity164 routinely considers military allies )			0
human rights groups say the @entity12 military is a serial offender ; the military continues to deny this			0
while we wait for progress on these fronts , one thing is already clear			0
if the immediate reaction of the @entity12 government to this latest incident is anything to go by , no lessons have been learned from april			2
several hours after the news broke , no word emerged ; from the president or his office , or from the @entity195			0
this is probably going to be like april all over again .			0

@entity4 's latest abductions may meet a weary global reaction , @entity198 says
eight months since the @entity204 abductions he argues that little has changed
the outrage that *sparked* # @entity26 will not defeat @entity4 he says
what is *needed* is superior military strength and training , @entity198 writes
