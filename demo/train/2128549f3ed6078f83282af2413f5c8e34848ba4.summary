-- and their allies -- are deeply concerning to many people , in and outside of @entity16			1
while @entity16 is not alone in this apparent trend , the vehemence of some of the homophobia , and the way it is being linked to pan-african struggles against @entity24 imperialism , is striking			1
not surprisingly , many people now view @entity16 as the most homophobic continent in the world			1
it is commendable that so many want to help in the fight against state - backed repression of sexual rights			2
before rushing in , however , let 's keep four things in mind			2
first , @entity16 is not a country			1
it is 54 , 10 of which have signed the 2008 @entity40 declaration recognizing sexual orientation and gender identity as human rights , including two which had originally opposed it but switched sides in 2011 ( @entity47 and @entity48 )			2
consenting male adult homosexual acts are legal in 14 @entity51 countries , while female - female sexuality is largely ignored outside a handful			2
in 2004 , @entity54 joined @entity16 in decriminalizing sodomy while @entity56 and @entity57 have made discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexuality unlawful			1
the country of @entity16 has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world for protecting human rights and was a co-sponsor of the @entity40 ' 2011 initiative to develop global strategies to end violence and discrimination against sexual minorities			1
one can be skeptical about international human rights statements and the reliability of the police and courts , especially for the poor majority			0
but important symbolic victories have been won in recent years across @entity16 , and in some cases policy reforms have been substantive			1
while not highly publicized , for example , many states now provide some health education , anti-retroviral medicine and other services to men who have sex with men ( condoms in prison and the like )			2
there has been an explosion of culturally sensitive scholarship by an emerging generation of @entity51 researchers that undermines homophobic claims			0
gay - friendly art , literature , theatre , and films have also flourished			0
one of @entity103 's best - known authors , @entity104 , publicly acknowledged he was gay just this year , joining a growing list of political , religious , and cultural figures in @entity16 who have spoken out forcefully against homophobia			1
second : homophobia in @entity16 is real and dangerous , but appearances can be deceiving			1
many of the factors contributing to the recent homophobic turn in @entity51 politics have their roots outside of @entity16			1
homophobes today often cite " family values " as a traditional reason @entity51 hate homosexuality , and it is true that there was a strong culture of extended families to help folks survive in often harsh environments			2
yet the @entity51 philosophy of " @entity127 " meant keeping families together even when members strayed from the heterosexual , married , and fertile ideal			0
this meant tolerance accommodation with sexual difference as long as discretion was maintained			0
enforced celibacy or abstinence , adultery , impotence , erotic preference for the same sex ... all these things were known and understood as part of the diversity of the world to which humans , ancestors and the yet - born could adapt			0
@entity147 as traditionally practiced in @entity16 was also relatively accommodating to the fact that individuals sometimes strayed from the ideal moral behavior			1
the family could be maintained through all of that by using discretion and appropriate rituals , prayers , sacrifice and / or compensation			0
@entity158 , @entity159 and capitalism messed much of this up			0
the @entity162 in particular were almost systematic in their introduction of laws that criminalized male - male sex acts			0
@entity168 missionaries denounced them with the threat of eternal hell - fire			0
families were meanwhile broken apart to serve the labor needs of the colonialists			0
africans were taught that they had no history and no culture of value , indeed , maybe they were not even quite human			0
political independence unfortunately did not solve this ideological hangover			0
on the contrary , since the 1980s especially , bad governance and economic turmoil have left much of the population of @entity16 frustrated			1
we in the @entity24 should not forget our role in creating the present shambles in so many @entity51 countries , whether through assassinations , bribery , or more subtle economic thumbscrews			1
the " @entity195 consensus " around neo-liberal structural adjustment was particularly devastating to families and social safety nets			0
in this context ( rich getting richer , poor poorer ) , there is a widespread hunger for scapegoats and for simplistic solutions			0
third , mainstream faiths have not been very good at addressing @entity51 ' need for spiritual meaning after so many decades of economic and political malaise			0
the @entity206 has by contrast been very active , and well - funded , in stepping in to fill that void			0
there is compelling evidence that @entity212 evangelicals have been instrumental in promoting @entity51 who will spread the homophobic message , including ghost writing speeches and advising on the @entity216 in @entity3			1
a similar " homophobia international " may be happening in muslim - majority countries where the @entity218 is gaining ground over traditional @entity221 beliefs			2
in a place like @entity2 , where sectarian violence is a looming threat to the stability of the nation , homophobia is one of the few points of agreement for canny politicians to calm the sectarian waters			2
in a place like @entity3 , which some see acting as a mercenary for @entity212 geopolitical schemes in the region , denouncing the @entity24 's so - called social imperialism is an easy way to cover complicity in a resurgent real imperialism on the continent			1
finally , let us not forget that homophobia is not yet dead and buried in the @entity24 before we jump on our high horses			1
maybe we can help our friends in @entity16 and ourselves by supporting @entity9 in their efforts to strike at the @entity24 roots of " @entity51 homophobia			1
" a federal court case in @entity252 bears watching , in which @entity3 activists are suing an @entity212 pastor " who is charged with persecuting homosexuals			2
their triumph in that case will surely be a bigger blow for the global cause of human rights than cutting off aid or imposing other sanctions on @entity51 people			0

this week @entity3 passed a bill that could mean life in prison for " *aggravated* homosexuality "
@entity278 says the vehemence of some of the homophobia in @entity16 is striking
but he says @entity16 is a continent and its countries differ in their *attitudes* to homosexuality
