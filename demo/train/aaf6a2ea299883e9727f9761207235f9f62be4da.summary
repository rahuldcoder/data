-- calling it " a stark wake - up call to everyone involved in college sports , " the @entity1 announced a $ 60 million fine against @entity6 on monday and stripped 14 seasons of football victories from the late head coach @entity9			1
@entity1 president @entity10 said the unprecedented fine will be paid over five years to fund programs that serve the victims of child sexual abuse			1
the @entity1 also banned @entity6 from postseason play for four years and took away 20 football scholarships a year for four seasons , he said			2
the sanctions are part of the continued fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach @entity22 , who was convicted in late june of 45 of the 48 counts he faced involving 10 young victims			1
they 're a blow to one of college football 's traditional powers , a two - time national champion			2
" no price the @entity1 can levy will repair the grievous damage inflicted by @entity22 on his victims , " @entity10 said			1
" however , we can make clear that the culture , actions and inactions that allowed them to be victimized will not be tolerated in collegiate athletics			1
" read more : @entity6 board member resigns over @entity22 scandal @entity6 avoided the @entity1 's " death penalty , " a suspension from play of a year or more			2
but @entity45 , the chairman of the @entity1 's executive committee , said the sanctions laid on the school " should serve as a stark wake - up call to everyone in college sports			1
" @entity9 , who coached at @entity6 for 46 years , was fired after @entity22 's arrest in november			1
@entity53 , the school 's president , was also let go			2
two other former university officials face criminal charges in the @entity22 scandal			1
the @entity57 also acted monday , ruling that @entity6 is ineligible for its conference title football game and that the @entity60 ' share of bowl revenues for the next four seasons -- about $ 13 million -- will be donated to charities that " protect children			1
" the @entity1 action follows an independent investigation led by former fbi director @entity67 , whose report held @entity9 and other top @entity6 officials responsible for failing to stop the abuse beginning in 1998			1
@entity6 president @entity71 said the university has accepted the decision and will not appeal			1
" i think , for the whole university , what this calls upon us to do is to look at our whole value culture , our whole value set , our value base , " @entity71 told @entity0			1
the school will have to ask itself " what are the most important things in terms of a university , our mission , our educational mission , educational excellence in all of its dimensions , " he said			2
" those conversations are going to go on from the top on down , from the board to my administration to the leadership of all of our various units , and drive those conversations down , " he said			2
@entity9 had been the all - time leader in major college football victories for a coach , with 409 wins			1
the @entity1 's decision strikes 111 of those from his record , beginning in 1998 -- a move that posthumously bumps him from the top of the list			0
photos : @entity9 through the years @entity9 's family sharply objected to @entity67 's findings and criticized the @entity1 for following the report 's conclusions			1
" the sanctions announced by the @entity1 today defame the legacy and contributions of a great coach and educator without any input from our family or those who knew him best , " his family said in a statement released monday			1
but one prominent advocate for sexual abuse victims objected to the @entity1 's decision to spare @entity6 from suspension			1
the @entity126 said the death penalty would have been " the most effective deterrent to current and future cover - ups			0
" " vacating wins is a hollow punishment that will be forgotten by the time the next season begins , " the group said			0
" bans from bowl games have been issued in the past because players traded championship rings for tattoos			0
this is not a punishment that is equal to the horrific crimes that happened at @entity6			0
" @entity126 urged parents and and " all who care about kids to remain vigilant " about @entity6 's compliance , warning , " what we 've learned from decades of similar scandals in churches is that agreements like this lack real follow - up			0
" @entity10 defended the punishment in a @entity0 interview monday night , saying the sanctions will deliver $ 60 million to aid sex abuse victims			1
" that 's 100 times greater than any fine ever levied in the history of the @entity1 , " he said			2
" we have imposed significant penalties on a competitive end of the football program			0
the university has been very , very responsive in the openness of providing all of the information about this , and so we feel very comfortable where we are with these penalties			2
" @entity170 gov. @entity169 , meanwhile , called on @entity6 to offer assurances " that no taxpayer dollars will be used to pay the $ 60 million fine imposed on the university today			1
" university spokesman @entity174 told @entity0 on monday that school will not use tax or tuition dollars to pay the fine			1
a recent university study said the football program had a $ 161.5 million impact on @entity170 in 2009			2
the football team made a $ 53.2 million profit in 2010 , according to @entity184			0
the school made $ 24 million more through general merchandise sales			0
" one of the grave dangers stemming from our love of sports is that the sports themselves can become too big to fail , indeed , too big to even challenge , " @entity10 said			0
" the result can be an erosion of academic values that are replaced by the value of hero worship and winning at all cost			0
" the postseason ban , which is also unprecedented , could damage the school 's prestige in the eyes of potential recruits and will affect the program 's bottom line through the loss of potential millions from the conference title and bowl games			0
the penalties also deal an emotional blow to the @entity6 community , one fan said			0
" by essentially taking away the main pillar of the university , you are almost pulling the university down , " former student @entity214 told @entity0			2
he complained of media coverage that fails to point out the good that @entity9 , known affectionately by fans as " @entity9 , " achieved through requiring his players to also succeed academically			1
" anybody who 's gone to @entity6 , that 's something that really is going to bother people , " he said			0
former @entity6 running back @entity226 said that football will return to the school , " but i think that there are some things that are bigger priorities than that right now			0
" @entity226 , who played for the @entity60 from 2004 through 2007 , said his relationship with @entity9 was " excellent , " and " he never lied to me			1
" " that being said , i do n't really know what went on behind closed doors			0
i do n't know how much information he did or did not know , " he said			0
former @entity240 football coach @entity239 , who now becomes the winningest coach in major college football history , said monday that he is " not rejoicing			2
" " i really do n't think anybody can until this thing is settled , until those young men have their say so			0
... until then , nobody can be joyful about it , " he told @entity0 's @entity248			0
" what happened , happened			0
" a lawyer for one of @entity22 's victims said the @entity1 should have heard from his client and others who were abused			2
" throughout the past several weeks , @entity6 and the @entity1 have imposed sanctions and taken what they perceive to be corrective measures , " said @entity256 , attorney for the person identified as victim no. 4 in the @entity22 case			1
" i am disappointed that no effort was made to consult the victims in this case to ensure that their voices were heard in this @entity268 after all , they are the ones who were victimized , not the @entity1 or @entity270 " ireporter : this is an end of an era @entity10 said current players will be allowed to transfer to other schools without having to sit out a year , as is normally required , or they can stay and keep their grants , even if they do n't play football			2
the restrictions mean that starting in 2014 , the school can not have more than 65 players on scholarship , and it can offer only 15 new scholarships each year for four years , beginning with next year 's incoming recruits			0
" i knew when i accepted the position that there would be tough times ahead , " new coach @entity284 said in a written statement			2
" but i am committed for the long term to @entity6 and our student athletes			0
