" any talk about any use of any kind of a weapon like that in this situation is horrific and chilling			0
the @entity2 regime has a responsibility to the world , has a responsibility first and foremost to its own citizens to protect and safeguard those weapons			1
" @entity7 's remarks come after months of international chatter about whether foreign countries should intervene militarily to try to end more than a year of bloodshed in @entity2			2

" others say it is impossible to let him leave			0
not only would it let him get away with thousands of murders and the destruction of the country , but it also would give him a green light to keep on doing what 's he 's doing , knowing that when he decides to leave , he can leave			2
" read more on preparing for @entity86 's exit but @entity144 said she thinks there is " absolutely zero " chance that the president will take up the @entity85 's offer			1
