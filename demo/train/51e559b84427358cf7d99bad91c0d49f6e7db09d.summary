on tuesday , three @entity1 - trained scientists won the @entity2 in physics , for finding definitive evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating			1
their discovery did not fit any existing theory , so it had mind - blowing implications for our understanding of the physical world			2
at the same time , it 's relatively easy to explain to nonspecialists			0
so fasten your seat belts for a quick tour of this frontier of knowledge : what was the actual discovery , why is it important , and what does it mean for our world ? flash back to the 1990s , when two independent research teams set out to " weigh " the @entity28 -- one led by @entity30 , a young physicist at the @entity31 , the other by a @entity34 professor of astronomy , @entity36 , with former graduate student @entity37 , now at the @entity38 , and then - graduate student @entity39 , now a senior astronomer at the @entity41 and the @entity42			1
these astrophysicists knew the universe was a vast , mostly empty space , dotted with galaxies of stars in a thin sea of atoms			2
thanks to work 70 years earlier by @entity50 ( after whom @entity52 's space telescope is named ) , they also knew the universe has been expanding for billions of years			1
like all astronomers , they expected the expansion to be slowing due to the pull of gravity between galaxies and other matter			2
it 's pretty simple : the more stuff in the universe , the greater the gravitational " braking " of the expansion			2
so , the @entity2 - winning experiments were designed to measure the rate of deceleration of the expansion , and thus the total amount of material in the universe			1
what could go wrong ? after all , gravity was the only known force that could play a role			1
both teams measured the distances to supernovae in distant galaxies , expecting they would be closer to us than if there were no gravity at all			2
imagine the shock when the data indicated the expansion was speeding up			0
@entity84 appeared to be more distant -- fainter -- than if the expansion speed were unchanging			0
what ? ! the accelerating rate of expansion signaled that gravity , a force we have known about and loved since the first apple fell from a tree , is a paltry thing compared to some new , utterly unknown , energy field that pushes galaxies apart			1
we call this new thing " dark energy " -- signifying the energy that appears to push outward , with the adjective " dark " signifying that we know nothing whatsoever about its nature			1
moreover , in 2003 , @entity52 's @entity104 cosmology satellite showed convincingly that dark energy is the dominant constituent of the universe			1
this stuff was n't predicted by any physics theory and was completely unknown until the @entity2 - winning teams of astronomers and physicists made their measurements -- yet there is more of it than anything else in the universe			1
more than the atoms that make up you and me and our @entity120 , more than the hydrogen and helium that pervades the universe , more than the unknown dark matter particles that cause attractive gravity and allow galaxies to form in the first place			1
whatever it is , it 's teaching us something utterly new about how matter and space and time behave			0
a fundamentally new physics theory is needed			2
the fact is , dark energy is the biggest mystery in science			1
it has driven a huge amount of research in the past decade , and was a key driver in last year 's " @entity141 , @entity146 " report from the @entity143 , which prioritized future astronomy and astrophysics projects			0
making better measurements of the properties of dark energy was very high on the list , using the @entity150 , now nearing completion , as well as an infrared - optical space telescope to be built in the coming decade			1
both teams measured the expansion rate using supernovae , which are stupendous explosions at the end of a star 's fuel - burning life			2
astronomers know that a certain type of supernova always emits roughly the same amount of light , meaning it is a " standard candle " that can be used to indicate distance			0
@entity167 supernovae would be farther away , and brighter ones would be closer			0
to make their measurements of supernovae , the teams used telescopes around the world and in space , most run by the @entity175 and @entity52			0
a supernova 's spectrum ( how light is distributed across the blue - green - yellow - red optical spectrum ) reveals the speed with which it is receding from us due to the expansion of the universe			1
you 've probably noticed how the tone of a siren changes as it moves toward or away from you , and that the change is larger the faster the vehicle moves			0
light emitted from supernovae shows the same kind of frequency shift , so its speed can be measured very accurately			0
one more ingredient was essential for the experiment : the ability to look back in time			0
it takes a very long time for light to travel to us from these supernovae , which are rare occurrences in distant galaxies			0
light from a nearby supernova might take hundreds of thousands of years to reach us , while light from the distant ones sought by the @entity30 and @entity208 teams travels for billions of years			0
this means that looking at supernovae or galaxies at different distances maps the expansion history of the universe -- that is , the rate at which it was expanding at different times in the past			2
measuring the change in expansion speed -- the deceleration -- was the experimenters ' goal			0
instead the @entity30 and @entity226 teams found the expansion was accelerating -- as unexpected as seeing a ball fall upward when you drop it			0
new data were critical to the bizarre new picture			0
@entity39 , using the @entity233 to measure extremely distant supernovae , showed that earlier in the universe gravity was actually winning over dark energy -- that is , the initial big bang expansion of space was slowing down			1
later , as galaxies moved farther apart , the attractive force of gravity between them weakened , and dark energy , which seems to be a constant property of space itself , took over			1
in today 's universe , 13.7 billion years after the big bang , gravity is far weaker than dark energy			1
so @entity39 ' discovery clinched it : alternative explanations for the original discovery would not have shown this evolution from gravity - dominated to dark energy - dominated space			1
astrophysicists are hot on the trail of dark energy			1
a fellow physics professor asked me , following @entity261 's @entity260 lecture on dark energy by @entity30 , one of the @entity263 , " does n't this just keep you up at night , wondering what this stuff could be ? " it 's keeping a lot of us up at night			1
what does this discovery mean for the rest of the world , for people not engaged in figuring out the laws of nature ? dark energy does not directly impact our lives , at least not now			1
our galaxy has billions of years to go before dark energy could be strong enough to rip it apart			1
events move slowly on universe - al time			2
but if history is any guide , understanding the physics of particles , space and time has proved incredibly valuable time and time again			2
much of the technological innovation that drives our economy today is derived from physics discoveries decades ago , according to the 2006 " @entity296 " report from the @entity143			2
the development of the quantum mechanics theory of matter in the 1920s led to the electronics in today 's computers , industrial and household electronics , from your @entity304 to your toaster			0
diagnostic imaging used to discover cancers or other disorders has its roots in the scattering of light and particles by matter , as studied by physicists using particle accelerators			0
astronomers led the development of electronic imaging devices which are now used widely in digital cameras			0
airport x-ray scanners were built by a company run by astronomers interested in detecting x-rays from stars and galaxies			0
the list goes on and on			0
when @entity37 became an expert on supernovae , he was thinking about how stars explode , not a @entity2			2
when @entity39 started graduate school , he was thinking about how the cosmos evolved to the present day			0
when @entity30 persuaded his laboratory to do his supernova experiment , he wanted to weigh the universe			0
when @entity36 attracts hundreds of students to his astronomy classes at @entity34 , he teaches them about distant objects and events that seem impossibly remote from our daily lives			0
but their passion for science led to a @entity2 - worthy discovery			1
it reminds us that the @entity1 remains one of the leaders in cutting - edge scientific research and the training of future scientists			1
this discovery has challenged our very best theorists and attracted clever young people to science			0
and some day far in the future , understanding how dark energy could be a property of empty space throughout the universe may well have a profound impact on how we live back here on @entity120 .			1
