responsibilities come along with a camera : when to use it or when to set it aside			2
our human nature is to gawk , and the camera often creates a layer of added unreality , shielding at least our full attention from all that is in front of us			2
a freelance photographer for the @entity13 recently took a heart - stopping photo of a subway train bearing down on a man who had fallen on the tracks			1
instead of trying to pull the man to safety , the photographer took photos			1
one landed on the cover the @entity25			2
the public outcry -- against the photographer , the paper and the bystanders who also did nothing to save the man -- was swift and severe			1
back in the day when mobile phones did not come with a built - in camera , uproars made us duck and cringe			0
you 'd suck in your breath and hope that trouble might sweep by without touching			0
nowadays , if you are an ordinary citizen or even a special officer who is off duty , i hope you will find a quick , compassionate , humane response to everything in life			0
my purpose here is not to address the issue of journalists who are merely on duty , looking for spot news or prowling for features			0
my argument is not about instinct and reflex , which probably gripped the subway photographer , @entity55			1
he told reporters he " had no idea " what he was shooting			0
" i 'm not even sure it was registering with me what was happening			0
i had my camera up -- it was n't even set to the right settings -- and i just kept shooting and flashing , hoping the train driver would see something and be able to stop			1
" opinion : why the outrage over photo in subway death ? whatever @entity55 's motives may have been or still be , it is the habit of many photojournalists to shoot a lot and to keep shooting at all costs , especially in the heat of a dramatic moment			1
it 's the reality of the job			1
in the movies , every photojournalist starts off as an aloof , confused , emotionally stunted voyeur			1
think of @entity85 in " @entity86 , " @entity87 in " @entity88 " or the photographers portrayed in " @entity90 , " " @entity91 " and " @entity92			0
" screenwriters always demand that they lay their cameras down and , only in that way , attain clarity , take action and remake events for the sake of a noble , happy ending			0
bearing witness is never enough , in this characterization			1
it 's a popular conclusion , seemingly the only one that we are fed , but it is not in the best interests of society			1
indeed , the @entity109 feels so conflicted about our role that it now goes beyond giving out awards simply for the best pictures of the year			1
it now has another plaque for the photojournalist who stops taking pictures , choosing instead to save a stranger 's life or limb			1
i 've been an investigative journalist and photographer for over 40 years , half of that in the field and half of it on the assignment desk			2
i am frequently called upon to judge the work of my peers			0
the journalist 's job is to be invisible and , in that way , to see on behalf of everyone else			1
we perform our most vital role when the stakes are high , even to the level of life and death			2
our duty is to test the tough question , the one at the very heart of a given story , the one immediately at hand			0
say a photojournalist and an editor want to do a story about medicine and public policy			1
they might reflect on a couple of these questions and attempt to show them in a journalistic investigation : how often do schizophrenic patients stop taking their meds , becoming a danger to themselves and others ? does trouble sometimes show up like clockwork and for the same combination of reasons ? might a schizophrenic patient with a history of violence pick fights and hurt people ? is it time for an intervention ? nothing could be more compelling for the public and policymakers to examine , and photographs could be the best way to illuminate the problem			2
if the system needs fixing and our role as journalists is to witness things when they break down , we ca n't go around preventing or fixing the breakdowns before they even happen			1
we have to simply watch and wait and see how bad things get			1
we must see for ourselves			0
stories of this quality are not psychologically easy for the journalist to undertake , or for the public to digest			2
they must be presented in a dignified manner , with the fullest possible context			0
if editors try to be quick and lurid in their display , both subjects and audience will only feel insulted			0
back in 1977 , in @entity194 , i watched the brutal interrogation and torture of a man over a three - day period			1
the officer in charge later learned that the prisoner had died as a result			0
up until that point , the government and the army had insisted that there was nothing to the rumors of such treatment , that if there were problems , they were n't significant			1
only by waiting and watching patiently , i found out that there was more to the story			0
in 2005 , i sat on a panel at @entity214 that reviewed the best journalism of the year			0
one unforgettable news photograph -- out of a portfolio of 20 -- showed @entity219 insurgents pulling a man out of a car in midday traffic and shooting him in the head			2
when we awarded that eyewitness account with a @entity228 , a chorus of criticism was heaped on the decision			0
the photo was too disturbing , so they said			0
how did the photographer just happen to be there ? could n't he have stopped it ? was n't he just as bad as the bad guys ? @entity236 was doing his job			1
he was performing one of the most crushing duties that society can assign , all in the name of today 's honesty , tomorrow 's decisions about it and history 's fullest account			2
entering this profession is not easy , and not everyone has the internal strength for it			0
but we dare not turn a blind eye			0
someone 's got to do it .			2
