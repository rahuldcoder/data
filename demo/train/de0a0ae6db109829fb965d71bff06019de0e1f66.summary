-- two iconic women with seemingly radically different world views died recently , leaving legacies of humor , pioneering spirit , and striking public personas			1
as divergent as their styles were , former @entity9 editor @entity8 and comedian @entity10 each used their appearance as a means to an end : @entity10 to make herself the butt of the joke , @entity8 to get ahead personally and professionally -- and to show generations of women how to do the same			1
whether chasing beauty or mocking it , these women broke ground by reflecting and reshaping the values of their eras while paving the way for the women behind them			2
original mad women like @entity27 in the @entity29 tv series " @entity31 , " at midcentury @entity10 and @entity8 both worked as advertising copywriters early in their careers			1
they each segued into more recognizable versions of themselves as they approached their 40s , carefully crafting their looks and personas into brands that would become instantly recognizable to the @entity40 public			2
both women would display a penchant for plastic surgery and outlandish style , using themselves as canvases to depict the life of the modern woman			1
a girly @entity8 in an era when settling into marriage and family young was the norm , @entity8 married at 37 and took over the helm of @entity9 at 43 , a position she held for more than three decades			1
her 1962 book " @entity55 , " was the precursor to " @entity57			0
" it was also the hopeful embodiment of the " fun , fearless female " ethos later instilled in hopeful @entity9 girls everywhere			0
in reality , @entity8 , who died last week at 90 , gave up the single life to become the devoted wife to husband @entity65 until his death in 2010			1
( a @entity68 obituary quotes her as saying , " i looked after him like a geisha girl			0
" ) but she never gave up her fun , flirty , single - girl attitude			0
throughout it all , she exhibited a carefully lacquered persona , almost painfully thin , perfectly coiffed and manicured , with the occasional nip and tuck to retain her trademark waif - like look			0
pretty ugly at the age of 37 , @entity10 was a harried homemaker and mother of five , who followed her husband 's advice to try her hand at humor writing and performing			1
unlike the perfectly polished tv counterparts of her era , such as @entity88 or @entity89 , @entity10 presented a more realistic version of marriage and motherhood that had more in common with " @entity93 " than " @entity94			1
" and people loved it			0
@entity10 , who passed away monday at 95 , chose not to represent a prettified version of her life , but rather the outrageous extremes of family			1
fictionalized versions of family members in her act included husband @entity104 , mother - in - law @entity105 and sister - in - law @entity106			0
@entity10 's exaggerated makeup and wigs and outlandish costumes deliberately disguised her plain , if not beautiful face and womanly curves			1
in a 2006 interview in tv guide , @entity10 talks about posing for @entity115			1
as the legend goes , the editors hoped her appearance would be played for laughs but were disappointed to discover that instead of being bony and unattractive , she was simply shaped like a woman			0
making up in a previous incarnation , i worked as a celebrity makeup artist and , among other things , worked with various @entity9 cover girls			0
they all seemed impossibly tall , aloof and preternaturally beautiful			0
i remember blushing to the roots of my hair at my first shoot after being singled out by @entity8 , who complimented my beautiful skin			2
@entity8 's complicated feminist legacy in 2006 , i was called out of cosmetic retirement to do the makeup for the cover of a now - defunct literary magazine celebrating female writers and editors			2
i was delighted to see @entity8 , clad in her signature fire engine red suit and fishnets			2
at 84 , she was frailer than i remembered , but still sizzling			0
i reminded her of our previous interactions and she looked at me and said , " that 's well and good , and you still look pretty , but what have you done since then ? " i was struck by the fact that a woman who had built an empire atop the cult of female perfection did n't think that looking pretty was enough			0
pretty powerful pioneers both @entity8 and @entity10 created idealized versions of themselves to sell their products			1
both were groundbreaking thinkers , businesswomen and performers			0
in one way or another , both used their faces and bodies as their calling cards			0
remembering @entity10 @entity8 paved the way for women like @entity166 to create careers and publications that celebrated the multi-faceted modern woman			1
she also made room for magazines including @entity172 or websites like @entity174 that thumb their nose at everything she 'd worked for and stood for			0
@entity10 opened the door for comedians like @entity180 to ridicule the classic feminine ideal ( see @entity180 's riotous @entity183 bit ) , and for @entity184 to lead a sitcom as the anti-mom in looks , shape and demeanor			2
more than that , she led the way for traditionally feminine - looking , yet frequently foul - mouthed comedians including @entity193 and @entity194 to be outrageous while remaining attractive			0
@entity8 and @entity10 were tough and successful and lived life by their own rules			1
they were two sides of a coin that paid the dues for women in today 's media landscape			2
