-- from bikinis and tank tops to short shorts , summer fashion calls for a whole lot of skin			1
when you 're not feeling your beach bod best , time to break out the caftans , those long , loose garments with wide sleeves			2
these robe - like gowns have transcended their ancient origins to become summer fashion staples with universal appeal thanks to their forgiving silhouette , whether you 're @entity19 or @entity20			1
" they 're extremely comfortable , and they 're extremely flattering to many body types , " said fashion historian @entity21 , director and chief curator of the museum at the @entity23			1
maybe your fashion - forward mom donned a caftan to host pool parties or to swing by the neighborhood shindig			1
or maybe you caught " @entity31 " star @entity32 wearing one on " @entity34 , " describing caftans as her " go - to " item around the house and inspiring one of the best theme parties ever : caftans and casseroles			1
depending on what they 're made of , caftans can be worn any time of the year , @entity42 said			2
but " we tend to see them as summer wear " because they are one of few clothing items that keep you cool in warm weather without having to bare a lot of skin			2
through the years , designers from @entity55 to @entity56 have reinterpreted the caftan in sync with the styles of the time			0
but what makes a caftan distinct from a flowing dress essentially has remained consistent : a t - shaped garment reaching the ankles that can be pulled over the head			1
from there , the rest is up to artistic interpretation			0
the caftan -- or kaftan -- has come a long way since the early days of the @entity73 , when soldiers wore them under chain mail armor , " reputedly impenetrable by the enemy 's sword " thanks to a weave of heavy cloth padded with silk floss , according to @entity82 's @entity81			1
the word itself is @entity73 and translates to a battle garment worn by soldiers , said @entity89 , curator of textile and fashion arts at the @entity93 , which houses one of the country 's largest collections of @entity98 textiles			1
references to caftans appear in @entity73 art and literature as early as 600 @entity103 , and revered @entity73 poet @entity104 mentions them in his seminal work , " @entity107 , " or the @entity73 " @entity107 , " she said			1
beyond the battlefield , anyone from the peasant class to the upper class could enjoy caftans thanks to their simple structure , which allowed for embellishment and adornment depending on one 's means , @entity89 said			2
much like today , the caftan was worn as a length of draped fabric with sleeves , open or closed , that could be wrapped around the body with a sash or belt			2
@entity125 conquerors introduced caftans to @entity126 , where different groups interpreted them according to their religious and cultural traditions , and @entity130 imperialism led to cultural contact with the @entity132 , allowing for caftans to infiltrate the @entity134 wardrobe , said @entity42			0
ambassadors to the @entity137 in @entity138 received gifts of caftans as early as the 17th century that played well into the era 's imperialistic obsession with " @entity143 , " she said			0
" the @entity144 in particular liked to have themselves portrayed in @entity137 dress , so there are a number of portraits of them in caftans , " she said			0
the style evolved in 18th - century @entity130 into ankle - length gowns that open in the front known as banyans , @entity42 said			0
in the 20th century , when @entity130 imperialism opened up @entity126 to @entity134 artists and tastemakers , @entity130 designers like @entity158 and @entity159 derived inspiration from @entity162 and @entity163 styles of caftans to create evening coats and dresses for western women			0
when wealthy jet - setters and superstars took off for places like @entity162 and @entity171 in the 1960s , they brought back eastern fashion traditions along with spiritualism , @entity42 said			0
@entity175 and @entity55 adopted the style into a symbol of bohemian elite that trickled down to mainstream fashion in the 1970s			0
the caftan continues to change with the times , with embellishments and diverse patterns offering a more feminine silhouette			0
now , as then , the drapey dresses appeal to diverse audiences , from starlets on the red carpet to diplomats at @entity190 to summer music festival - goers			1
