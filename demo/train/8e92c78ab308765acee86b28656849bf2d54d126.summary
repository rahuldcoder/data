@entity0 , @entity1 -- the school buses usually rolled into the grounds of the @entity5 around 8:30 a.m. , carrying dozens of elementary school children			1
but today , the grounds were empty of students , teachers and staff -- as were the six other public schools in this town where the unimaginable happened			1
the yellow buses were replaced with black vans with tinted windows carrying friends and family			2
they pulled up outside the town 's only funeral home as @entity0 buried the first of its slain youth			1
a steady stream of mourners strolled down @entity26			1
dads in black trench coats held the hands of their wives , their boys dressed in coats and ties , their girls in dress pants			2
they walked , heads bowed , to the @entity38 , a white colonial house where people have helped bury @entity0 's dead since 1903			1
they tried to ignore the chaotic scene outside : the black vans , police cars , and tv news satellite trucks			2
this was another new day in @entity0 , the first weekday since the massacre at @entity49			1
sunday night 's interfaith service was over			1
president @entity51 was back in @entity52			2
what can you say ? how can you explain this heinous act on the nation 's most innocent ? @entity58 presents , already wrapped and under the tree , will go unopened next week			1
siblings will miss their brothers and sisters for the rest of their lives			2
and the very fabric of a quaint @entity67 community has been altered			1
we have to do better ... those were the words of the president as he spoke to the community and the nation			1
a refrain that 's now become a mantra in town			1
a statement so powerful it evokes tears from moms , dads , grandparents who repeat it			2
twenty - six dead -- 20 children , all aged 6 and 7			2
and also so real , here			0
every hour or so , a police car or ambulance or fire engine roars down @entity26 with its sirens blaring			1
oh , no , what now ? teachers were heroes in the face of death reporters , their eyes swollen from shedding their own tears , struggle to ask questions			0
@entity0 on monday bid farewell to two 6 - year - old boys : @entity49 , whose love of sports ran the gamut , but none so deep as football ; and his classmate , @entity49 , whose family said he could get what he wanted just by batting his long eyelashes			1
it 's just the beginning of a long healing process , a realization that the normalcy residents awoke to last friday will never return			1
many flocked to the @entity120 , a deli that has long served as a hub of community activity			1
among its specialty sandwiches is the @entity49 , hot roast beef with bacon , melted cheddar and ranch dressing			0
@entity130 , a father of four young children , brought two of his sons to the sandwich shop after paying their respects at @entity49 's funeral			1
peace on this day , he said , was " just having the kids come in the bed with you in the morning			0
... that 's when it 's all kind of normal			1
" " it 's weird because you 'll run into things that will remind you of before the tragedy happened and it feels like a normal day , " he said			1
" and then , you 'll run into things that remind you of what happened			0
" members of the news media are everywhere , as are police officers			0

" the whole town is just heartbroken , " said @entity190 , a retired nurse from @entity208			0
" as you walk the streets , people are crying and hurt and sometimes they might feel alone			0
and it 's nice to have someone come up alongside you and cry with you and hear your story and pray with you			1
" the most chilling stories , she said , are from parents and teachers who were at the @entity221 last friday			0
" what stands out in my mind , " she said , " is just the impact that it 's had on them and what they remember : the noises and the sounds and the smells			1
those things are going to be burned in their minds			0

she 's been the children 's librarian for 15 years			1
she knew nearly every child killed			0
she 's surrounded by thousands of books			2
but no amount of words , no amount of reading material , could prepare a town for such horror			0

" their families have been bringing them in here , most of them since they were little , to get books			0
" they had recently finished a gingerbread workshop			0
she has fielded hundreds of calls and e-mails from around the country , people wanting to help @entity0			1
she 's not sure what to make of it all -- she 's both touched and overwhelmed			2
it 's only been three days			2
