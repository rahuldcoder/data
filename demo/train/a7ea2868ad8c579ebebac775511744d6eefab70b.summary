-- take one part @entity3 's " @entity2 , " two parts @entity4 's " @entity5 " and an even larger measure of guesswork and @entity9 's latest political drama could seem like a @entity12 thriller			1
for @entity9 watchers , the all too real political theater playing out in @entity14 may offer another tantalizing glimpse behind the opaque curtain of the @entity9 regime , but raises more questions than answers			1
depending on how you read the signs , the execution of @entity9 leader @entity23 's uncle and formerly trusted regent , @entity24 , either shows a young leader further cementing his control , or the first death throes of a regime teetering on collapse			1
in the absence of any independently verifiable information , and in a regime where paranoid rhetoric is the normal register of almost all diplomatic language , any conjecture is likely to be as accurate as it is to be wide of the mark			2
@entity9 : leader 's ' traitor ' uncle executed for @entity44 , the founder of the @entity45 , @entity9 remains for analysts a " @entity48 that no one can solve			1
" he said @entity9 is a master at carefully choreographing the way it releases news events to cloak its real intentions			1
nevertheless , he said a careful reading between the lines of @entity9 new agency kcna sometimes reveals glimpses of the state of the regime			1
he said that far from asserting the leadership of @entity44 , recent events suggest that his position has been seriously eroded by the execution of his uncle			1
" my guess is that these events happened some time ago and they are only now being released , " @entity44 told @entity0			1
" the fact is that we do n't know what 's going on in @entity9 but what we are seeing coming through on @entity70 is very concerning			1
" when you look at the language used in these @entity70 reports it is particularly hawkish and it 's much more reflective of the military than it is of @entity23			1
" basically we are seeing the hardline faction reassert itself			0
for @entity23 , @entity24 was the bridge between him and his father , and now he will have very little protection			2
" he said that @entity9 , famous for tightly controlling the drip feed of real information coming out of the country , was now sending out violently mixed messages			2
" the recent release of the prisoner ( @entity85 ) and this execution could n't be more at odds ; what this indicates is that it 's a chaotic situation in there , " he added			2
" what this points to in terms of regime change is that it 's a question of ' when ' rather than ' if			2
' " what history tells us is that when it does happen it will be unexpected and extreme and everyone must be prepared for the worst case scenario			0
" for @entity101 of @entity102 in @entity103 , however , the purge of @entity24 shows a young leader consolidating his grip on power			1
" some of the reasons are quite obvious and very transparent and many predicted that this was going to happen			0
what is really surprising is how it happened			0
pretty much everybody expected that in the near future a state head would be removed from power , " @entity101 told @entity0			0
" but people did not expect that it would happen in such a dramatic and theatrical manner			0
" he said that @entity24 's removal and execution displayed the deadly manner of generational political change in @entity9			1
" @entity23 became the leader of the country after only one year of being a kind of anointed successor			2
he has had no time to create his own team , so he 's had no choice but to rely on the team from his father and this team consists of people who are in their 60s and 70s and sometimes even older			0
he said that this politburo consisted of men who could be @entity44 's father or even grandfather			1
" imagine how difficult it is to run a country -- especially one with a strong @entity144 tradition -- when all your senior advisers are older than you			0
and these are people who can have very different ideas of goals and strategies			0
" it was clear from the first days of his rule that he would remove most of the people around him			0
@entity24 was particularly vulnerable exactly because he was initially appointed by late @entity158 to be a regent -- the chief adviser to the young ruler			0
" but being a regent is a dangerous job			0
the king gets older and he feels more and more irritation and to hold more of a grudge against these noisy , strange , grumpy old men			0
" for a regent , it 's very good to know when to retire but not everyone is smart enough			0
" opinion : how @entity44 purged his uncle			2
