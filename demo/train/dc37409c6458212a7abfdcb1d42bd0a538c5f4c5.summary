editor 's note : @entity2 is a foreign affairs analyst who is the host of " @entity2 : gps " on @entity5 at 1 p.m. et sundays			1
" @entity6 will have to fight to attract capital and investment like every other nation , " says @entity2			1
@entity10 ( @entity5 ) -- the crisis in global financial markets will top the agenda as finance ministers from the world 's top industrialized nations and central bank governors meet in @entity18			2
in an effort to breathe some life into economies around the world , the @entity19 , in tandem with five other central banks , lowered its key lending rate to 1.5 percent from 2 percent			0
however , the global financial crisis has sunk its teeth in to the point that analysts say the $ 700 billion bailout plan and coordinated rate cut were merely steps in the right direction , and it will take much more to really get credit moving			2
@entity5 spoke to world affairs expert @entity2 about the most recent developments			2
@entity5 : is the economy as bad as everyone is saying ? @entity2 : what is happening now is a deep , wrenching financial crisis unlike any we 've seen since the 1930s			1
it 's contributing to a broad slowdown of the @entity6 economy			1
the pain is spreading across the world			0
but the history of capitalism is filled with credit crises , panics , financial meltdowns and recessions			1
it does n't mean the end of capitalism			1
@entity5 : then why ca n't we just let the free markets resolve the current economic problems without the federal government getting involved ? @entity2 : we just ca n't accept the downswings that used to be routine for @entity64 countries in the 19th century , when we saw much less intervention by the government			1
can you imagine the political fallout from 20 percent unemployment or 5 percent growth rates ? the government must experiment with massive interventions in the market to ensure credit starts flowing smoothly again			1
these interventions have become part and parcel of modern capitalism			2
@entity5 : so what should the government do ? @entity2 : that is the real question : how to regulate the markets so you get the maximum innovation and growth , but temper their wilder movements ? the government will have to do this by trial and error			2
no one knows in theory what the perfect system would look like			0
in the short run , whatever it takes , including buying up mortgages , debt , equities			0
clearly , @entity6 's financial system needs new , different and better regulations for the 21st century , and this crisis should help produce those			1
@entity5 : what does it mean for the @entity6 ? @entity2 : people around the world once saw the @entity6 as the most modern , sophisticated and productive economy in the world			1
now they wonder , was this all a house of cards ? they listened to @entity6 policymakers with respect , even awe			0
today , they wonder if these officials know what they are doing			0
this loss of credibility will have hard consequences			0
for decades , the @entity6 has attracted massive amounts of capital -- 80 percent of the surplus savings of the world -- which has allowed it to live beyond its means			2
that era is drawing to a close			0
@entity6 will have to fight to attract capital and investment like every other nation			0
@entity5 : what can we do ? @entity2 : we need to wake up and get serious about our challenges			0
we must address all these issues , and fast -- restore confidence , reform the system , return the country to fiscal sanity			1
we have the opportunity to remain the pivotal player in a richer , more dynamic , more exciting world			0
but we have to take a substantial shift in our approach .			0
