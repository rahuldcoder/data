-- when the @entity3 economy collapsed , millions of us lost our homes , our jobs , our retirement savings and our faith in the @entity3 dream			2
what we gained was a very clear view of the vast -- and growing -- divide between the rich and the rest of us			0
like many hardworking @entity3 earning minimum wage , @entity13 knows firsthand what it 's like to live on the edge			2
she works as a transporter for passengers with disabilities at @entity21			0
she wakes up at 1 a.m. to go to work , and spends the early morning hours pushing wheelchairs to gates and helping travelers on and off planes			0
with tips , and @entity29 ' minimum wage -- which is $ 1 above the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 an hour -- @entity13 makes about $ 18,000 a year , or $ 10,000 below the federal poverty limit for a household of five			1
@entity13 lives with her four school - age children in a three - bedroom apartment on @entity36 's @entity35			0
two recent shootings on her block make her fear for her children 's safety , but she can not afford to move			0
@entity13 is unable to pay the $ 850 per month rent , so she and her family perform janitorial tasks for the landlord to make ends meet			0
the children 's clothing is all secondhand , @entity13 uses food stamps to make sure everyone is fed and when it is time to buy shoes for school , she has to save an entire paycheck			0
tuesday marked the third anniversary of the last increase in the federal minimum wage			1
for the last three years , while the prices of gas and milk have risen steadily and the richest 1 % have enjoyed huge tax breaks , the federal minimum wage has remained frozen at $ 7.25 an hour , which amounts to just $ 15,080 a year -- as long as you get paid for any time you take off			1
that 's more than $ 7,000 below the federal poverty line for a family of four			2
as a result , the purchasing power of the minimum wage has slowly eroded -- in just three years , its real value has sunk to $ 6.77 per hour , a nearly 50 - cent drop			1
the @entity77 tax cuts , which are simply the perquisite of the moment for the 1 % , allow for the richest to prosper at the expense of middle - class and low - income workers			1
while ceos make millions and their corporations make billions as part of a so - called economic recovery , the majority of @entity3 are struggling to make ends meet			2
this struggle is exacerbated by the low federal minimum wage			1
as middle - class jobs are increasingly replaced by low - wage work , however , this is the economic reality for a growing number of @entity3			1
unless @entity96 raises the federal minimum wage , economic security for workers in low - wage jobs , the fastest - growing sector , will disappear			1
it is incumbent on members of @entity96 to raise the federal minimum wage and index it to inflation , putting more money into the pockets of ordinary @entity3 to boost our economy and aid a real , long - term recovery			1
the @entity112 has been introduced in both the @entity113 and the @entity114 to do just that , while also raising the federal minimum wage for tipped workers , which has been a meager $ 2.13 since 1991			1
the @entity119 , not yet introduced , is also a call for a more decent wage			0
support for these bills is support for an economic recovery that extends to all @entity3			2
this legislation could make a difference for @entity128 , a father of three in @entity129			0
he worked as a sandblaster , supporting his wife , their twin boys , daughter and two nephews , until the economy crashed			0
now , @entity128 makes $ 7.36 an hour as a telemarketer			2
@entity128 's wife is sick and unable to work , leaving him as the sole breadwinner			0
@entity128 estimates he brings home about $ 200 every other week and his bills are more than double that			0
@entity128 and his family recently sat in the dark for a few days because he had to choose between paying his electric bill and buying groceries			0
when things got really rough , @entity128 asked neighbors if they could spare a few slices of bread and some cheese for sandwiches			0
he is heartbroken that he is unable to provide even basic necessities , like food and school supplies , for his children			0
people who work for a living should be able to make a living from their work			0
low - wage workers should not have to scrape by , while many of the companies they work for are making more money now than they were three years ago			1
the federal minimum wage has n't kept up with inflation , but ceo pay has risen 725 % over the last 30 years and 80 % of all real income growth has gone to the richest 1 % of @entity3			1
the real value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968			2
had it kept pace with rising living costs , the minimum wage would exceed $ 10.50 per hour today			2
meanwhile , the @entity3 economy has been reorganizing over the past 30 years away from middle - wage jobs in manufacturing and construction and toward low - paying jobs in the rapidly expanding service , retail and restaurant industries			1
we have little reason to expect large corporations that are the principal employers of low - wage workers to voluntarily offer higher pay ; rock bottom wages are a core profit - making strategy for retail giants and fast food chains			1
nor does reality match the myth that prosperity at the top will eventually " trickle down " to workers at the bottom : corporate profits are at their highest level as a share of @entity202 , and wages at their lowest , since the 1950s			0
neither facts nor common sense support a federal minimum wage stuck at $ 7.25			1
it was n't low - wage workers who crashed the economy			1
it was not a raise for these workers , but rather an unquenchable thirst for profit , that led to @entity216 's disastrous game of financial @entity218 roulette			0
why , then , should low - wage workers pay the price ? how high must profits go before a modest wage increase is n't raised as a specter of impending corporate doom ? it 's easy to exploit such fears in this economic climate , but these tired old canards -- trotted out in every minimum wage fight -- are just an excuse for political inaction and continued corporate greed			1
the bottom line is that people who work for a living put their money right back into our economy			0
what business in this country needs right now is customers and too many hardworking @entity3 are n't making enough money to get by			2
if we raise the federal minimum wage and demand the 1 % pay their fair share to reduce income inequality , we will boost our economy , help small business grow and create jobs .			1

***writers*** : working at minimum wage , @entity3 ca n't keep families fed and clothed
as prices rise , they say , federal minimum wage stays at $ 7.25 an hour , or $ 15,080 a year
***writers*** : as @entity258 , corporations profit , middle - class jobs lost to low - wage work
***writers*** : minimum wage hike would help struggling @entity3
