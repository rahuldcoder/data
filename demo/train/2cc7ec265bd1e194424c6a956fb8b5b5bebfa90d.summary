-- voters in @entity2 will go to the polls this weekend for the first time since the eurozone crisis left the single currency -- and much of the continent -- teetering on the brink of chaos			1
while the campaign has n't exactly set the world on fire -- voter apathy could prove a major issue -- what happens in ballot boxes across the nation sunday has the potential to change the future of the euro , and of @entity21			1
who 's in the running ? @entity24 , the country 's current chancellor , is campaigning for a third term in office			1
were she to win , she would be on course to overtake @entity29 as @entity21 's longest - serving female political leader			2
@entity24 , a physicist - turned - politician from the @entity2 , came to power in 2005 as leader of the @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , a center - right conservative party			1
initially she served as chancellor in a " grand coalition " of politicians from both sides of the political spectrum ; in 2009 she won re-election at the head of a conservative coalition with the @entity44			2

and while she does have detractors at home , she remains @entity2 's most popular politician by a long way -- according to the latest @entity61 report by the @entity62 , two thirds of @entity55 approve of her handling of the eurozone crisis			0
who is she up against ? her major opponent is social democrat @entity67			0
@entity67 served as finance minister in @entity24 's first government , a grand coalition between the @entity35 and the left - leaning @entity71 , from 2005 to 2009 , overseeing the country 's bank rescue plan			1
gaffe - prone @entity67 caused the biggest controversy of the 2013 campaign when a photograph of him gesturing with his middle finger graced the cover of a popular magazine			2
@entity24 's current coalition partners , the conservative @entity44 ( @entity81 ) , are struggling to connect with voters -- polls suggest they may even fall below the 5 % minimum vote threshold and lose their place in @entity2 's parliament , the @entity86			1

are there any newcomers on the scene ? sunday will mark the national election debut of two new parties looking to shake up the @entity55 political scene : the @entity101 and the @entity103 ( @entity103 )			1
all eyes will be on the ballot boxes to see whether they can secure the votes they need to win seats in the @entity86			0
the @entity103 , founded in april 2013 , is made up of so - called " euroskeptics , " opposed to the single @entity21 currency and to @entity2 's role in the bailouts of several struggling eurozone nations , which they see as a waste of money the country can ill afford			2
seen by many as a " party of professors " the @entity103 currently has between 2 % and 4 % support , just short of the 5 % it would require to take up seats in parliament			0
however , political commentators have warned it could damage @entity24 's re-election hopes by splitting the conservative vote			2

with up to a third of @entity55 voters " undecided " there are plenty of ballots still up for grabs			1
what are the big issues ? there 's just one , and to misquote @entity152 's campaign strategists : it 's the economy , @entity154			0
compared to many of its neighbours , @entity2 as a whole has continued to thrive throughout the eurozone crisis : it is the biggest economy in @entity21 , with a healthy manufacturing industry and the continent 's second lowest unemployment rate			0
however , not all of @entity2 's citizens are feeling the benefit : large numbers of people are reliant on low - paid " mini-jobs " which leave them struggling to make ends meet			0
the @entity172 are calling for a national minimum wage to combat the problem of the " working poor			0
" the @entity71 has also called for tax increases -- a proposal rejected by @entity24			0

the @entity86 's 622 seats are divided between the two , with 299 going to local candidates ( under a first - past - the - post system ) , and the remainder allotted to politicians from party lists , on a proportional representation basis			0
to enter parliament , each party must secure a minimum of 5 % of the vote to win seats in parliament			0
votes given to parties that do not meet this threshold are redistributed amongst those who do			0
@entity55 politics is all about forging coalitions and alliances ; no single party has governed the nation alone since reunification			0
who will win ? until recently , the election looked like a slam - dunk for the popular @entity24 and her allies			1
however , the @entity44 ' dip in the polls puts the current coalition at risk			0
should the @entity81 lose its place in the @entity86 -- a possibility if the fledgling @entity103 splinters the conservative vote -- @entity24 would have to cement fresh alliances in order to remain chancellor			1
read more : is @entity24 the most powerful female politician ? the @entity35 has ruled out linking up with the @entity103 -- despite their mutual conservatism , the @entity103 's resolutely anti-euro stance contradicts the @entity34 ' policies			1
instead @entity24 could return to the " grand coalition " days of 2005 - 2009 , working with the @entity172 -- and @entity226 -- once more			1
alternatively , should they perform well at the polls , the @entity172 could seek to oust @entity24 by forming a left - wing coalition with the @entity94 and @entity91			1
why should those outside @entity2 care ? @entity2 is @entity21 's largest economy and its government has the leading voice in governing the @entity232			2
if @entity55 voters decide to replace conservative @entity24 with left - leaning @entity226 , the whole currency union could be affected			1
@entity226 is skeptical of @entity24 's austerity - focused policies and has said he would do more to encourage growth and investment			2
although they disagree on economic policies , @entity226 has made it very clear that should he win the election , he would follow in @entity24 's footsteps by demanding all eurozone countries stick to " sound fiscal discipline			2
