-- a quick look at @entity3 's nuclear industry and the problems faced at three plants since friday 's massive earthquake off northern @entity7 , as compiled by the @entity8 : nationwide @entity3 's electric power companies run 54 nuclear reactors , with two under construction , at 17 power plants , according to figures from the @entity14 , the @entity16 nuclear watchdog			1
they produced more than 280,000 gigawatt - hours of electricity in 2010 -- about 30 percent of @entity3 's total electricity generation			1
most @entity3 plants -- including the three facing emergencies since the earthquake -- use boiling - water reactors , in which water circulated through the reactor is converted to steam and used to drive a generator			1
most @entity28 reactors and about 40 percent of @entity3 's are pressurized - water reactors , in which reactor coolant is kept separate from the steam used to drive generators			1
both types are far different than the @entity35 design involved in the @entity36 , a reactor model now considered unsafe by the international nuclear industry			2
in addition , the @entity36 plant lacked the kind of reinforced steel - and - concrete containment structure that @entity28 and @entity3 regulators require			1
@entity44 is the largest of the nine utilities that operate @entity3 's nuclear plants and runs the two plants affected by friday 's quake			1
in 2002 , its president , vice president and chairman resigned after a scandal in which @entity44 was accused of falsifying safety repair records in 29 cases			0
the company instituted reforms in september 2002 in an attempt to restore public confidence			0
@entity60 the plant with the worst reported problems is @entity44 's @entity60 , about 65 km ( 40 miles ) south of @entity63			2
three of the plant 's six reactors had already been shut down for inspection at the time of the quake , but two of the three that were in service at the time have been damaged , the utility said			2
an explosion caused by hydrogen buildup saturday blew the roof off the no. 1 reactor 's containment structure and injured four workers , but the reactor was not reported to have sustained damage			0
workers have been pouring a mixture of seawater and boron into the no. 1 and no. 3 reactors in what experts have called a last - ditch attempt to prevent a meltdown -- a catastrophic failure of the reactor core , with a potential for widespread radiation release			1
@entity3 nuclear regulators have said there is a " possibility " that at least a partial meltdown already has occurred in the reactors			1
the government has evacuated more than 200,000 residents from homes within a 20 - km ( 12.5 - mile ) radius of the plant and tested 160 people for radiation exposure , authorities said sunday			0
the six units at @entity60 went into service between 1970 and 1979			0
@entity111 @entity3 authorities have detected cooling - system problems at @entity44 's @entity111 plant , but have not expressed any concerns about possible meltdowns there			1
nevertheless , those living within a 10 - km radius of @entity111 were ordered to evacuate as a precaution			0
@entity44 reported that cooling systems the three operational units at @entity111 failed after the quake , but the @entity124 , citing @entity3 authorities , reported that all three had power sunday afternoon			1
@entity44 reported one fatality at the plant			0
a crane operator who had been trapped at an operating console in the plant 's exhaust stack was pronounced dead saturday , the company reported			0
@entity111 is about 80 km south of @entity63			0
the plant 's four reactors went online between 1981 and 1987			2
@entity135 @entity3 officials declared an emergency sunday at the @entity135 nuclear plant after finding radiation levels above allowed levels in the surrounding area			2
however , radiation levels had dropped to normal levels by early monday , and the " current assumption " of @entity3 authorities is that the increased radiation levels may have been caused by material released from @entity60 , according to the @entity124			2
the plant reported smoke in a turbine house after friday 's earthquake , but @entity3 has told the @entity124 that the three reactors at @entity135 are under control			1
@entity135 is about 70 km north of @entity63			0
it is owned by the @entity153 , and its three reactors entered service between 1983 and 2001			0
reactor no. 2 was shut down for a five - month inspection in november , according to the company .			0
