@entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity0 said in an interview with @entity3 wednesday that if the @entity6 eventually rules that same - sex marriage is constitutional , @entity5 would have to abide by that ruling			1
" i would n't agree with their ruling , but that would be the law of the land that we would have to follow until it 's somehow reversed — either by a future @entity6 , or a @entity5 constitutional amendment , which i do n't think is realistic or foreseeable , " he said			1
he said he expects the question " is ultimately going to find its way to the @entity6 , " noting that many federal courts have recently issued rulings overturning state bans on gay marriage			1
indeed , many court watchers expect the @entity6 to take up a case on that very issue this month , and potentially deliver a ruling this @entity26			0
that prospect , and the end of @entity1 's same - sex marriage ban this week , have brought the issue back into the national spotlight and sparked a fresh debate within the @entity33 over gay marriage , which the party 's social conservative base staunchly opposes			1
former @entity1 gov. @entity37 , who is preparing for a potential run for president , offered a careful statement respecting the decision for the @entity1 development			2
during a tuesday interview with @entity3 in the @entity44 , @entity0 declined to evaluate @entity37 's comments because he said he had n't seen them			1
but the senator , who is contemplating a presidential run of his own , said he would respect federal courts ' decisions to overturn gay marriage bans			1
" my position on [ gay marriage ] is pretty well - known			2
i mean , i believe that the institution of marriage is defined as the union of one man and one woman			0
i understand that voters in some states have changed that , and i respect it , " he said			0
" and , you know , we have a court system that 's beginning to weigh in — and whatever the law is , we 're going to abide by it and respect it			0
" but his tuesday comments came in contrast to remarks he made in a speech at @entity74 in july defending state legislatures ' and voters ' rights to oppose gay marriage without judicial interference			2
" americans like myself who support keeping the traditional definition of marriage also have a right to work to keep traditional definition of marriage in our laws without seeing them overturned by a judge , " he said , according to @entity80			0
the @entity1 senator clarified during his wednesday phone conversation that he felt his remarks did not constitute a shift from his july speech — that while he felt the court was mistaken , the state 's officials had no option but to abide by it			2
" i think [ the court 's decision ] is wrong , both on legal principles , and i also think it 's the wrong way to " reverse @entity1 's gay marriage ban , which was approved by voters in 2008			1
he said the proper way to overturn a gay marriage ban is to offer an opposing ballot measure for the state 's voters to again consider			2
but he added : " i do n't think [ @entity1 's ] clerks have a choice , at this stage , given that the ruling is there unless there 's a stay , " to follow the court 's decision and issue marriage licenses			1
@entity0 said if ultimately the @entity6 issued a ruling protecting gay marriage as constitutional , opponents of gay marriage would be " in the same boat as opponents of @entity126 , " the @entity6 decision that established a woman 's constitutional right to an abortion			1
the controversy surrounding the issue underscores the tension inherent in the @entity33 's efforts to expand outreach beyond the @entity33 's traditional base of social conservatives , as the nation as a whole moves towards widespread acceptance of gay marriage and more state legislatures overturn gay marriage bans			1
it 's likely to become a hot - button issue in the @entity33 presidential primary as contenders jockey to differentiate themselves in what 's expected to be a wide - open field			0
@entity37 's recent announcement that he 's " actively exploring " a bid is expected to dissuade some from entering the race , and his launch this week of a leadership pac and super pac heightened speculation over his bid			1
many expect that if @entity37 runs , @entity0 , who shares much of @entity37 's political circle in @entity1 , wo n't — but the senator said tuesday it wo n't impact his decision			1
" there 'll be multiple people running for president			0
they 're all going to build organizations and raise money , " he said , noting that if @entity37 runs he 'll be a " very formidable candidate			0
" but he added : " i think once someone makes a decision and that 's what they want to do to serve our country , you do that irrespective of who else might be in the race			2
" " no one 's decision would have a bearing on whether i decide whether that 's where i want to serve or not — not just his , " @entity0 continued			1
@entity0 has the unusual challenge of deciding whether to run for reelection to the @entity186 or for president in 2016			0
if he does decide to launch a presidential bid , he 'll likely face stiff competition from a number of his colleagues in the @entity186 , including sens. @entity192 and @entity193 , both of whom have made little secret of their interest in the race			0
but @entity192 , passing @entity0 on his way to the @entity44 , gave @entity0 a brotherly pat on the back and joked to a reporter , " whatever he says , " before rushing off , as @entity0 laughed			0
@entity0 later said his relationship with @entity192 was " good			0
" " i hopefully get along with all my colleagues			0
we do n't all agree on everything , especially with my @entity210 colleagues on some key issues , but hopefully we get along with everyone , " he said .			0

@entity0 said @entity5 should " abide " by a @entity6 decision if it rules gay marriage is constitutional
local officials have no choice but to abide by federal courts ' decisions to overrule gay marriage bans , he added
@entity0 said @entity37 's decision on 2016 wo n't dissuade him from running
