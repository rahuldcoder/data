@entity0 , @entity1 -- king @entity3 of @entity1 declared sweeping constitutional reforms friday that will boost the power of the prime minister and take away some of his own			1
@entity1 's revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable , the parliament in @entity11 more dynamic and will give the government greater powers , the 47 - year - old king said in a nationally televised address			1
in the 30 - minute speech , the sovereign described the draft constitution as " a bedrock of the special @entity1 democratic development model -- a new historical bond between the throne and the people , " while describing himself as a " citizen king			1
" his actions followed a series of unprecedented protests not seen before in this @entity30 modern @entity29 country , where street protests are normally tolerated by the state , unlike in most other @entity34 countries			0
if the draft is ratified in a referendum set for july 1 , its most radical change would be empowering voters to select a prime minister , thereby ending the longstanding practice in which the king has selected his own man for the job			1
the prime minister has tended to take his lead from the sovereign on key matters of state			0
if @entity1 back the draft , then the new prime minister would have new powers in decision - making and in day - to - day management -- relieving the king of a number of duties and aligning the style of management along the lines followed by some @entity62 countries			1
in an example of power sharing , the draft constitution empowers the prime minister to dissolve the @entity67 , and stresses that the king shall consult him before announcing the dissolution of parliament			2
" it specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches , " the king said			2
friday 's speech stems from a process that was first announced in march , after widespread civil unrest in the wake of the revolutions in @entity86 and @entity87			0
the king instructed a hand - picked committee to consult with political parties , trade unions and civil society groups on constitutional changes with a brief to trim the monarch 's political powers and make the judiciary independent			1
but not all civil society groups were consulted , which sparked a wave of demonstrations across the kingdom from groups who feared they would be left out of the new plan			0
this move alone -- to grant real power to an elected prime minister -- could satisfy a number of demands from those members of society who have called for change			0
confirming the full authority of the head of government over cabinet members , the draft constitution gives the prime minister the power to propose and dismiss cabinet members			0
" this is good news as the power of the prime minister will be greater than before , " commented @entity120 , a leader of @entity121 20 , @entity1 's @entity123 youth movement , after watching the speech in a crowded cafe in the center of @entity0			1
" now the prime minister can change any minister who he sees is not doing his job properly			0
it was not like that before			0
" but @entity135 will remain a key power - broker in the security , military and religious fields , according to the draft			2
for example , the king would still serve as " the supreme commander of the armed forces " and would not relinquish the power to appoint ambassadors and diplomats under the new constitution			2
furthermore , the king would retain the power to dissolve parliament after consultations with the new constitutional court , half of whose members he would have appointed			0
the blueprint also takes the first steps toward making the judiciary independent -- a hot subject in @entity1 , where judges are aligned to political parties and appointed by the king himself and so -- according to critics -- are seldom guided exclusively by law in their rulings			1
and the country will remain a @entity29 state , though @entity1 in theory will be free to practice other faiths , since freedom of religion is supposed to be guaranteed under the constitution			1
unlike other @entity34 countries , @entity1 has a large @entity177 community , whose members have been free to worship as they wish			2
@entity2 's @entity179 contributed to this story .			0
