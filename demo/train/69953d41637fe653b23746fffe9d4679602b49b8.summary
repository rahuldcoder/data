in a dusty , run - down neighborhood on the outskirts of @entity3 , the capital of one of @entity6 's poorest and most conservative states , @entity7 , a vigilante group is making a name for itself			1
but these are no ordinary vigilantes			2
they 're girls -- mainly teenagers -- who patrol their local streets protecting women and girls from sexual harassment			1
in their matching black and red black salwar kameez -- the traditional garb worn by women across @entity20 -- they target offending males who have over-stepped the mark			1
the punishment ? humiliation , sometimes worse			2
their motivation is painfully clear			2
every single girl in the so - called " @entity28 " has been a victim of sexual assault -- some have even been raped by their own family members , they say			1
in most cases , the crimes have gone unpunished and the victim left to suffer the trauma in silent shame			1
these girls have been forced to act , they say , because no one else will			2
opinion : rewiring of society 's attitude needed cultural stigma while sex crimes are not exclusive to @entity6 , the number of reported rapes there has increased dramatically , from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011 , according to official figures			1
but campaigners say this is the tip of the iceberg			2
most women in @entity6 -- a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets , according to the @entity6 council on @entity61			1
the issue appeared to reach a tipping point in @entity6 in december last year , when a 23 - year - old woman was raped and fatally beaten by a group of men while traveling home on a public bus in @entity69			1
the attack provoked outrage across the world and sparked nationwide demonstrations in @entity6 , as protesters called for tougher laws on sex crimes and a change in attitudes towards women			1
with global attention trained on @entity6 following the appalling case in the capital , the authorities acknowledged that action was needed			1
home minister @entity85 said @entity6 plans to recruit more female police officers -- currently only 7 % of the @entity6 police force is female , according to government figures			1
the first fast - track court hearings have also been introduced to try to expedite cases in a justice system bogged down by red tape			0
it means sessions of the trial , once it begins , should take place nearly every working day until a verdict is reached			0
still , new cases continue to shock the nation , such as the 7 - year - old girl who was raped in a train bathroom last weekend after she was lured away from her parents			2
opinion : death penalty not the solution fightback on the fight against sexual discrimination on the streets of @entity3 preceded the international attention on sex crimes in @entity6			1
the self - defense group was started several years ago by teacher @entity114 , who discovered that an 11 - year - old girl she taught in the modest school block opposite her family home had been raped by her uncle			1
not long after this revelation , @entity114 found herself facing the unwanted attention of a colleague , who then tried to attack her			0
she managed to fight him off , but when she tried to report the incident , the local police were unimpressed			0
no one seemed to care			0
" this really upset me			0
it really affected me -- i would see any man in the street and would get upset and angry , " @entity114 , 26 , told @entity131			0
she said people in her community thought she had gone mad			0
but still nothing happened to her attacker			0
eventually she learned that all of her students had experienced some form of abuse -- from lewd comments and cat - calls , to molestation and rape			1
many of the girls said they were afraid to go out alone for fear of being groped or worse			2
it was then that @entity114 decided the girls had to protect themselves amid the deafening silence from within their own community			2
the " @entity28 " was born -- the red in their uniform is to symbolize danger and struggle , while the black represents protest			1
in groups of four or five , the girls approach males deemed to be harassing a girl and order them to stop			1
if the perpetrator refuses to heed their warning , they punish him by mocking him publicly -- a significant slight in such a male - dominated society			0
@entity114 admitted they have been forced to resort to violence on more than one occasion -- though she emphasized this does n't go beyond slapping			0
" the whole idea is to humiliate them , " she said			0
" we are well within our rights -- this is self - defense			0
the police are not supportive so we have to defend ourselves			0
" martial means and defend themselves they can , if their regular martial arts classes are anything to go by			0
in a dusty gym on the other side of town , the girls -- 15 of them -- are put through their paces on threadbare mats by a local @entity188 instructor			2
he drills them in several techniques , from punching and kicking , to breaking the hold of an attacker approaching from behind			0
a faded picture of martial arts legend @entity194 gazes down approvingly , as each of the girls attacks the instructor 's padding with intense focus and conviction			1
they have plenty to be angry about			0
@entity203 , their instructor , explained that he 's teaching the girls for free			1
" i 'm doing it for my own daughter , " he said			0
" these girls are brave and what they are doing is humbling			2
" the session ended with the girls lining up and bowing respectfully at their instructor			2
they have clearly learned how to channel their anger -- an asset on the unforgiving streets outside			0
but it 's not just @entity188 training the girls receive -- the group provides a lot of support on gender issues , sexuality and health			1
it even helps younger children to attend school			0
protest hours later , the girls were joined by several other supporters for a protest on the side of a busy highway in the center of @entity3			2
led by @entity114 , the girls held placards in @entity236 and @entity237 demanding safety for women and chanted for stricter punishment for sex offenders			1
the scale of their task is perfectly illustrated by this small band of determined girls fighting against the tidal wave of @entity3 's late afternoon traffic			1
some commuters clinging from buses look quizzically at the small protest , while others ignore the scene completely			0
asked whether they are dealing with a deep - rooted cultural problem , @entity114 's 16 - year - old sister , @entity253 , shook her head emphatically			1
" this is not a cultural problem -- it 's a social problem because men have a higher social status than girls			1
" the roadside protest may only have attracted a small number of people , but for @entity114 , the @entity28 is making a difference			1
" those who were voiceless before -- the girls -- now have a voice			2
now they speak for themselves and are emboldened , " she said			0
with two daughters campaigning against a hugely divisive issue in @entity6 , @entity114 's mother admitted she had reservations about what they were getting into			1
" i was scared initially -- i asked ' why is she was doing this ? ' there was also a lot of pressure from within the neighborhood that she should not be doing what she was			0
because she would hold meetings late at night , people would say ' your daughter is not coming back home until late at night , which is not good			0
' " then someone said to me ' let her to what she wants to do			0
' i now feel what they are doing is good and helping to bring a lot of change -- many boys who used to harass girls no longer do so because they are scared			1
" asked where she gets her courage from , @entity114 replied simply : " when you suffer , you get that courage			0
when you are victimized , you get that courage			0

the @entity28 is a group of young girls fighting against sexual abuse
many sex crimes against women go *unreported* in @entity6 *due* to cultural stigma
rape of a young girl on a public bus in @entity69 in december provoked outrage
many feel women 's issues , including sexual abuse , are not taken seriously
