-- " i will say , this moment is one that i will never , ever forget , " said @entity0 , recalling a 2008 trip to @entity2 , @entity3			2
" i was the first person inside a very , very old manmade chamber			2
it was an incredible feeling			2
then i turned on my headlamp and saw three huge spiders			2
" the opening to a possible future " @entity13 " movie ? close			1
@entity0 was describing his discovery of an ancient tomb -- including very well - preserved bones found therein -- as part of his study of archaeology , a passion that began for him when he saw the @entity13 movies as a child			1
" @entity26 is more like it , " he said , describing his interest in the movies , the first of which , " @entity27 , " was released 30 years ago this summer			2
" i could probably recite a large majority of the movies			2
" even though he 's a fictional character , it 's fairly safe to say that @entity13 is the most famous archaeologist in the world			1
" as a teacher , i would ask my students , ' how many of you were influenced by @entity13 films ? ' " said @entity33 , an archaeology fellow with @entity34			1
" everyone in the class would raise their hands			0
" @entity33 is the co-curator of " @entity13 and the @entity44 , " an exhibition that makes its worldwide debut at the @entity47 from april 28 through september 19 and then moves on to other international locations			1
his enthusiasm for @entity13 , and the exhibition , is infectious			1
the exhibition " has an incredible array of movie props from the films			1
it 's got a lot of the designs and paintings and artwork behind the making of these films , " he said			2
" and , we not only have almost 100 incredible treasures from around the world , but we also have the archaeologist 's drawings and techniques they use to investigate the past			0
you get to see what was in the minds of the filmmakers , and the archaeologists			0
" aside from the " @entity13 " versions of the @entity74 and the @entity75 , there is a lot in the exhibit for hardcore fans of archaeology as well			1
" we have a clay tablet with a map of a @entity83 city , one of the world 's oldest maps , " @entity33 said			0
" we have a fragment of a pot made 6,000 years ago , with the oldest representation of wine			0
we have a whole series of gorgeous prescribed pots from @entity93 , and the first video of a scholar reading a scene from a stela , in a language no one has spoken for hundreds of years			2
" @entity33 said he hopes that with this exhibition , " people will enter the door as @entity13 and they will exit very inspired about archaeology			1
we want to inspire as many people as possible about science			0
" @entity13 has certainly inspired a lot of people in the last few decades , judging from the @entity107 , like @entity0 , who shared their stories of adventure			1
@entity110 : watch video of @entity0 's excavation " thirty years ago i sat in a darkened theater , my eyes glued to the big screen , and was swept away into a world of wonder as ' @entity27 ' unfolded in front of me , " said @entity113 of @entity114 , @entity115			0
" like many of my generation , i dreamed of donning a fedora , picking up a bullwhip and setting off to confront the unknown			0
" things did n't quite work out like that for @entity128 , but 10 years ago , he took a chance and flew to @entity3 to join an excavation with the @entity131			0
" one summer turned into another , followed soon thereafter by a graduate degree in archaeology and finally a job doing what i love the most : excavating @entity138 ruins deep in the jungles of @entity3			0
" @entity128 finds his occupation quite fulfilling : " while i have never had to evade a cunningly constructed death trap or hold off a sword - wielding fanatic with my trusty bullwhip , i feel that i am living out the dream that i had as a young man			0
" @entity110 : see photos of @entity128 's archaeological adventures @entity149 of @entity150 , @entity115 , who left his dedicated four - year engineering program at the @entity153 , had a similar experience in 2009			0
" i had dreamed of exploring hidden chambers and escaping in runaway coal cars since i first saw the ' @entity158 ' movies as a child , " he said			2
" once the opportunity presented itself , i grabbed my hat and jacket and flew along the ' red arrow ' over the @entity164			0
" taking part in an archaeological dig in @entity168 - en - @entity167 , @entity169 , was unforgettable for @entity149			0
" it was an adventure in detailing history , and i am very fortunate to have been able to be a part			0
" the excavation was documented in a 2010 issue of " @entity34			0
" @entity110 : @entity149 's memorable trip to @entity169 @entity176 was also intrigued by archaeology at an early age , thanks to @entity13 , and studied geoarchaeology at the @entity181 in @entity182			1
in 2007 , she participated in a study in @entity185 's @entity138 lowlands			0
" the study is ongoing and we hope to learn a great deal about the site selection of the inhabitants in the region			0
" " even though there is n't as much danger and none of the spectacular @entity197 effects , it is no less exciting seeing these sites firsthand , " she said			0
@entity110 : adventures in @entity185 " @entity13 's gung - ho , get anything done attitude has served me well over the past 15 years working in the developing world , " said dr. @entity200 , who runs the archaeology volunteer program at the @entity202 in the @entity203			1
" @entity13 is passionate when he is teaching -- that is perhaps the most common adjective used by my students to describe me			1
i would like to think that i strike a bit better balance between archaeology ' work ' and family life -- thus @entity13 provides an example of how not to go about things			1
" @entity200 said he keeps @entity13 in mind , along with other influences , like @entity221 and @entity222 , when managing more than 650 archaeology sites			1
@entity110 : archaeology in paradise ? @entity226 from @entity227 , @entity228 , integrates @entity13 ' adventures into his history classes and created the website " adventures in learning with @entity13			1
" his work on this and in promoting the educational value of the " @entity238 " series on @entity237 led to the opportunity to visit @entity241 ' @entity240 in october : " twenty - nine years after first seeing a scruffy - looking , thrill - seeking archaeologist acquire , then lose , an odd - looking golden idol , i stood face - to - face with that same idol as it grinned at me from behind the glass of a display case			2
in an instant , i was sitting in a darkened theater watching @entity13 do his thing			1
it was 1981 , and i was 12 years old again			0
" @entity110 : adventures in learning with @entity13 of course , there 's a big difference between the fantastical adventures of the " man in the hat " and real archaeology ( the vast amounts of paperwork , for example ) , but even so , fans like @entity0 call it " a wonderful source for inspiration and adventure			1
" more ireporters talk about how " @entity13 " affected their lives in a time where it seems just about anything can be found simply by searching online , the legacy of @entity13 is a reminder that there 's still more of the world left to be explored .			1
