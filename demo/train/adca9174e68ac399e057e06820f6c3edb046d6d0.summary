call it a false memory			1
a trick of the mind			2
" television anchor @entity5 is n't the first person to be embarrassed by claiming a remembrance that , well , never really happened			2
recent history shows how several famous figures suffered what one expert labels a false " flashbulb " memory			1
astrophysicist and television host @entity14 , a protege of the late @entity17 , claimed he heard president @entity18 make a remark intended to highlight divisions between @entity21 and fundamentalist @entity22			1
@entity14 's assertion is still published on the webpage of the @entity25 , which he runs			1
" after the 9/11 attacks , when president @entity18 , in a speech aimed at distinguishing the @entity30 from the @entity22 fundamentalists , said , ' our @entity26 is the @entity26 who named the stars			1
' the problem is two - thirds of all the stars that have names , have @entity39 names			2
i do n't think he knew this			2
this would confound the point that he was making , " @entity14 said in a 2008 speech			1
fact checkers found @entity14 's recollection to be wrong , and the @entity49 even published an opinion piece in december 2014 by two psychology professors about the @entity14 incident and " @entity53			1
" " in his post- 9/11 speech , mr. @entity18 actually said , ' the enemy of @entity30 is not our many @entity22 friends , ' and he said nothing about the stars , " wrote professors @entity59 and @entity60			1
" mr. @entity18 had indeed once said something like what dr. @entity14 remembered ; in 2003 mr. @entity18 said , in tribute to the astronauts lost in the @entity68 space shuttle explosion , that ' the same creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today			1
' '' @entity14 later published an explanation and an apology on his @entity78 page			1
he noted how " blogosphere headlines " carried " accusations of me being a compulsive liar and a fabricator			2
" " and i here publicly apologize to the president for casting his quote in the context of contrasting religions rather than as a poetic reference to the lost souls of @entity68			1
i have no excuse for this , other than both events -- so close to one another -- upset me greatly			2
in retrospect , i 'm surprised i remembered any details from either of them , " @entity14 wrote in september 2014			1
there 's a twist on the @entity14 tale , the two professors noted in the @entity49			1
even president @entity18 suffered a false memory of what he saw on television the day of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
@entity18 recalled more than once how he saw the first plane hit the north of the @entity107 before he entered a classroom in @entity109 , where his reaction to the devastating attacks was forever captured on television cameras			1
" in reality , he had been told that a plane had hit the building , but had not seen it -- there was no live footage of the plane hitting the tower , " the two professors wrote			1
@entity18 's misremembrance was even the subject of a scholarly essay in 2004 by then graduate student @entity124 of @entity125 , now a human memory expert who 's a professor at the @entity128 in @entity129			1
@entity124 analyzed three recollections made by @entity18 of the event in a paper entitled , " president @entity18 's @entity133 of 9/11/01			1
" @entity124 found two of @entity18 's recollections to be impossible because footage of the first plane strike was n't available at that moment in time			1
" how can we explain these inconsistencies ? " @entity124 wrote			2
" over the past century , numerous studies have shown that people frequently suffer from false memories -- fictitious ' memories ' for events that did not really happen			1
" noting how the president had access to aides to jog his memory , @entity124 concluded : " we might expect that he would be better off than the average university undergraduate -- however , like so many others , he appears to be suffering from a near - textbook case of false recall			1
" when campaigning for president in the automobile mecca of @entity156 in 2012 , @entity153 claimed he witnessed as a child a famous event in @entity159 : the golden jubilee of the car on june 1 , 1946			1
in fact , @entity153 said , his father was the master of ceremonies			2
" i think my dad had a job , like , being the grandmaster or whatever of the 50th celebration of the automobile in @entity159 , '' @entity153 told a tea party rally in @entity166 , according to the @entity167			2
" they painted @entity174 with gold paint			2
my memory 's a little foggy here , so , uh , but -- yeah i was probably 4 or something like that			1
but they had the cars go down @entity174			2
'' problem was , @entity153 was n't even born yet			2
the event occurred nine months before his birth			2
the @entity185 exposed the misremembrance			2
" the timelines suggest @entity153 could well have been conceived that day			0
but it is inconceivable he was actually there , " the paper reported			0
a @entity153 aide told the @entity167 that the @entity193 candidate was merely telling a story about a family member			0
" @entity153 does n't say he was there			0
in fact , he says his memory was foggy , '' the aide said			1
" he was simply telling the story about his dad			0
'' in her own campaign for the @entity30 presidency in 2008 , @entity201 stated she evaded sniper fire when visiting @entity205 as first lady in 1996			1
while seeking votes , she provided a dramatic recollection of the event , which occurred on march 25 , 1996			0
" i remember landing under sniper fire			1
there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base , " said @entity211 , a @entity212			0
but her account was eventually challenged , first by the comedian @entity223 who traveled with her , and then by media outlets , the @entity49 reported			0
the @entity227 ' editorial board confronted her with video footage showing @entity211 's arrival at @entity231 , calmly walking from the rear ramp of a @entity30 @entity234 plane with her daughter , @entity236 , then 16 , at her side			1
both @entity238 held their heads up and did not appear rushed			0
the video also showed @entity211 spending several minutes talking with the group , including an 8 - year - old @entity243 girl who presented her with a poem , and later greeting @entity30 troops			0
@entity211 told the editorial board that she " misspoke " and the falsehood was a " minor blip			0
" " i say a lot of things -- millions of words a day -- so if i misspoke , that was just a misstatement , " she said			0
in a subsequent radio interview , @entity211 was n't worried about the incident hurting her credibility			0
" i have been in the public eye for many , many years , and this is something that i think happens to anybody , " she told radio station @entity260 in @entity261 , @entity262			0
his memoir seemed as good as gold			0
it was , after all , endorsed by @entity269 for her influential book club			0
@entity278 's " @entity277 " touched the nation and its endless compassion when he recounted a purported dramatic experience with substance abuse and recovery			0
the book sold millions of copies and became a best - seller			0
but the investigative website @entity282 found @entity278 's life was n't as exciting as he portrayed it			0
@entity278 eventually admitted he embellished events about himself and other characters in the book			0
" i made a mistake , " he later confessed to @entity269 in 2006			0
" i made a lot of mistakes in writing the book and promoting the book			0
" pressed if he lied or made a mistake , @entity278 elaborated on what happened			0
" i think probably both , " he said			0
he admitted to embellishing several facts : he was jailed for only a few hours , not 87 days ; and each character in the book was n't wholly represented			0
but he asserted his book remained a memoir			0
he told @entity0 's @entity297 that no one objected to about 200 pages of re-created conversations in the book , because it 's understood that those are subjective memories			0
" in every case , i did the best i could to recreate my life according to my memory of it , " @entity278 told @entity297			1
" when i had supporting documents , i used them			0
" @entity269 retracted her support of the author , saying she felt " conned " by him .			0
