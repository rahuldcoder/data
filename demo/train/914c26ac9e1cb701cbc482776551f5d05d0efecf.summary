@entity0 -- in a @entity4 video produced by activists from # @entity6 , a @entity7 civil society organisation , in march 2013 , an interviewer asks people in @entity7 's capital @entity10 what they think of their forthcoming national dialogue			1
they give a range of well thought - out answers , ranging from tempered optimism to near - total pessimism			0
the video cuts to a woman at the side of a dirt road near @entity21 , one of @entity7 's biggest industrial cities			1
" we are hungry and we need jobs , " she tells the blogger and activist @entity24 : the @entity28 , a six - month series of talks that should lead to the creation of a new constitution for the @entity34 's poorest country , is aimed at closing the gap between the country 's small military and tribal elite and ordinary people			2
the talks started on 18 march , and are the most inclusive political process @entity7 has ever seen , bringing together established political players with southern separatists , @entity45 rebels and youth activists			1
read more : @entity7 holds presidential election with one candidate the conference was due to come to an end on 18 september , but has been held up by wrangling between members of a working group looking at ways to address the grievances of the country 's marginalized south			2
@entity7 's poor people -- around half the country 's population -- do not have much of a voice at the talks			1
like the woman in the video , many do not even know what the dialogue is			0
instead , they are scrambling to make enough money to eat			0
if , as looks increasingly likely , the country 's next government is made up of members of the elite who profited from the regime of former president @entity76 , their situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon			2
@entity7 's poverty problem is not new			1
even before the political crisis of 2011 , well over 40 % of the country 's population lived below the poverty line while more than a third of all people aged 18 - 25 were unemployed , according to the @entity84			2
the protests , elite violence and ensuing security vacuum in 2011 caused the already weak economy to implode			0
by the end of the year , more than half the country 's population lived below the poverty line , a study conducted by the @entity7 government and international agencies found			1
the situation has stabilized since 2011 , and hundreds of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid has flowed into the country , meaning that the hunger crisis will be kept at bay for at least another year or two -- but not that living standards among the country 's poor are likely to improve substantially at any point in the near future			1
with @entity7 's population growing at 2.3 % a year , ( again according to the @entity84 ) , and oil -- the source of 70 % of government revenues -- running out , @entity7 's economy needs a massive shake - up			1
the government needs to become less reliant on oil and to help build a diversified economy which provides a wide range of jobs for @entity7 , who in turn must be better educated ( more than two thirds of all adults are illiterate ) and healthier			1
some of these issues were addressed during the dialogue conference : a working group at the talks tasked with producing recommendations on @entity7 ' basic rights called in july for the state to provide at least a basic level of education and healthcare along with guaranteed welfare payments to the country 's poor			1
but the question is how future governments are going to pay for any expansion in government services and welfare payments			0
in 2013 , the country 's transitional government passed not just the biggest budget in @entity7 's history , but also its biggest deficit , of about $ 3.2bn			1
most of the $ 12.9bn total spending package went to wages and overheads , with fuel subsidies in particular due to cost the government $ 3.5bn , or 8.5 % of all economic output , in 2013 according to the @entity147			2
the kind of deficits the government has been running up are simply unsustainable in the long - run , especially if oil output continues to decline			0
falling oil production hits not just government revenues , but the volume of foreign currency coming into @entity7 , which in turn helps prop up the value of the @entity7 riyal and pay the country 's import bill ( @entity7 is hugely import - dependent : some 95 % of wheat and 100 % of rice , staples in the national diet , are imported , according to the @entity166 )			1
a fall in the value of the @entity168 would push up the cost of living , hurting living standards among the poor even more			0
there are no quick fixes to these problems , but a good place to start would be the fuel subsidy			0
as the @entity147 notes in its most recent note on @entity7 , the subsidies " are not targeted and create major economic distortions and opportunities for corruption "			2
they benefit mainly the richest @entity7 , who consume the most fuel and electricity , encourage unnecessary consumption , and create huge opportunities for smuggling			2
the subsidy also encourages the use of diesel pumps to produce water , another huge problem for one of the most water insecure countries on the planet			0
plans have been in place to cut the fuel subsidy and spend the savings on welfare and growth - boosting infrastructure projects since the mid- 1990s			0
but each time someone actually tries to increase the cost of fuel and redirect spending towards the poor they meet huge resistance from established political , economic and tribal players			2
this is because @entity7 's economic problems are equally political			1
in our new @entity213 report , " @entity7 : corruption , @entity227 and @entity228 , " we argue that @entity7 's former president @entity76 used a huge system of patronage , involving everything from diesel allocations to access to military budgets and state contracts , to foster co-operation among members of the country 's small tribal , economic , and military elite			1
this system ultimately benefited a small number of people and helped @entity76 mitigate the threat of major internal conflict , but at the same time meant that the country 's elite were enriched at the cost of development that benefited the wider public			2
reforms like subsidy cuts ran counter to elite interests and so were impossible to implement			0
the levels of corruption seen in @entity7 would n't have hurt the country quite so badly if the proceeds were being spent at home			0
but increasingly , they are not			0
@entity7 's elite has invested their money abroad in property and other ventures , or left it nestled in secrecy jurisdictions far beyond the prying eyes of the @entity7 public			1
in our report we argue that when elections are held in 2014 the same people who took part in the saleh - era system of patronage and corruption are likely to be in charge once again and that they will continue to be incentivized by self - interest rather than any sense of the greater good			0
despite the rhetoric around the transition , they still control the government , the army , the tribes and the bulk of the @entity7 's economic resources			1
new faces may appear , but their ability to implement the kind of economic reforms @entity7 needs will be limited , as has become clear over the course of the transition , with the country 's ' unity ' government achieving little in the way of reform			1
as the transition period comes to an end over the coming months and new elections are held , there is likely to be a degree of self - congratulation among those who brokered the deal that led @entity76 to step down in november 2011 , avoiding the prospect of civil war			0
but if the transition is to be a success , the needs of ordinary people will have to be taken into account			0
the activists who took to the street over the course of 2011 must be supported in their quest for more transparent and accountable governance			0
and the voice of @entity7 's poor must be heard			1
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity311 .			0

@entity7 's economic problems are equally political , @entity311 writes
the government needs to provide a wider range of jobs for @entity7
to succeed , the voice of @entity7 's poor must be heard , he says
