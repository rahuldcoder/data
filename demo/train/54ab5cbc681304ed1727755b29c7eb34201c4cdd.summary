-- pop heartthrob @entity1 may be the perfect trojan horse for a meme			2
teeny - bopper singers are usually viewed as empty vessels meant to fill the marketing needs of cynical record executives			0
but as a child growing famous in the digital - remix age , @entity8 seems more than that : the 16 - year - old is like a white screen on which our trends can be projected			0
for a case in point , listen to the enigmatic " @entity19 800 % @entity18 , " which has become a sensation on the web			2
" @entity19 , " the second single from @entity1 's new album , was slowed down 800 percent and uploaded to the web by @entity23 , a 20 - year - old aspiring music producer in @entity24			1
the song 's trippy atmospherics have attracted more than 1.6 million plays online			1
assuming you do n't have 35 minutes to spare -- remember , it 's eight times as long as the original four - minute pop song -- " @entity19 800 % slower " turns the high - pitched bleats of the pubescent signer into primal howls and cries that seem to linger forever			1
imagine the mating calls of killer whales being vibrated through a @entity40 cathedral			0
the song is reminiscent of late ' 90s work from @entity45 artists @entity43 and @entity46 , as @entity1 's voice is both heavily deconstructed and eerily intimate			1
compare this with the original " @entity19 , " which sounds much less memorable			0
however , there is a twist			0
@entity51 suggests the @entity1 " remix " may not be a slowed - down version of " @entity19 , " but an untitled song from the @entity58 collective @entity56 's 2010 ep " echoes across the @entity55			1
" that said , @entity51 is n't sure if @entity56 really even exists since the ep was released on april 1 , 2010 -- @entity63			2
the question is , does it really matter ? whether it 's the latest malware or sexually ambiguous haircut , @entity1 's blank - slate pop image is the perfect selling tool for anything			2
" @entity19 800 % slowed " would n't have all those listeners without its connection -- real or not -- to @entity1 fever			1
his album , " @entity73 , " could n't be more appropriately titled			0
the opinions expressed in this blog post are solely those of @entity76 .			0
