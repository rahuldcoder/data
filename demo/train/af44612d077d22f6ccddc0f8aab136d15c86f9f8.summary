she may only be a slip of a woman , but @entity3 's athletic talent should not be taken lightly			0
a star in the martial art of @entity7 , the 21 - year - old @entity4 clinched gold at the @entity9 and the @entity10 in 2013 and was crowned champion at the 17th @entity10 held in @entity12 last september			1
having won numerous titles as a junior -- she was a national , regional and world champion -- @entity15 has n't tired of the winning feeling in her fledgling senior career			1
" each time i win and stand on the podium , i feel that i truly have won myself , " @entity15 told @entity20 's human to @entity21			1
" when they put the gold medal on me , i feel so emotional , as if it is a dream			0
" growing up in @entity27 , @entity15 was n't particularly interested in the sport and has an overweight relative to thank for sparking her career into life			1
" when i was small , i did n't know anything about @entity35 , " she said			2
" i only knew that martial arts could make you healthy			0
one of my cousins who was very fat practiced @entity35 to lose weight and i asked to come with him			2
" her cousin 's interest may have waned pretty quickly -- " he quit after a week -- he is still fat ! " she jokes -- but @entity15 has persevered and now tucks into a rigorous daily diet of exercise , training in both the morning and afternoon six days a week , sometimes longer			1
" before important tournaments , we even practice on sunday mornings -- the programs consist of physical and technique training			0
" the modern sport of @entity7 started life in ancient @entity54 as a form of self defense , explains @entity57 , a former member of the @entity59 wushu team			1
" @entity60 can be said to be the ancestor of all martial arts like @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 -- they all came from ancient @entity54 martial arts , " @entity57 says			1
" what really sets @entity35 apart ( from other martial arts ) is that it 's more of a complete system , in the sense that in the fighting aspect there are grabs and throws but also punches and kicks -- you can use anything you want			1
" from a performance aspect , it 's almost comparable to gymnastics -- everyone does 720 ( - degree ) rotations and lands in the splits			0
" there are also weapons to wield in @entity15 's non-combat discipline -- female competitors perform their individual routines with either a double - edged straight sword ( @entity95 ) or a spear ( @entity97 ) while the men use a slightly different type of sword , a @entity101 , and a wooden staff called a @entity103			2
" everything about @entity35 is equally very difficult , " @entity15 says			1
" it requires you to be persistent in training to combine the movements of your head , your arms , your legs and your whole body			0
it 's very important that all the movements are coordinated carefully			0
" as she roams around the floor space at the gym in downtown @entity27 and casually performs eye - watering stretches on the stall bars , it 's clear that this dedication has paid off -- her supple , flowing movements have a balletic quality to them			0
this combination of strength and grace is one of @entity7 's most appealing aspects , says @entity57 , but also one of the hardest to master			0
" the sport may be derived from traditional martial arts , but the movements are more beautiful and more emphasized , " he says			1
" you really need to be able to stretch and do the front splits -- flexibility is really difficult			0
the second thing is athletic ability -- there are lots of jumps and a high degree of rotation			0
" @entity57 grew up idolizing @entity54 wushu legend turned actor @entity145 , but for @entity147 it is her compatriot @entity148 who has spurred her on			2
the 35 - year - old , who now coaches the sport , made history in 1993 when she won a world championship gold medal at the age of 14 before repeating the feat four years later			2
" she was the first person to win a world championship gold medal for the @entity7 team , " @entity15 says			1
@entity15 will have a chance to emulate @entity148 at the @entity9 in @entity158 , @entity159 next october			2
@entity160 will be another acrobatic step towards her goal of mastering both the physical and the mental challenges of the ancient martial art. " in my opinion , in order to become a great athlete , one must have qualities of persistence , creativity and the ability to think , understand and sense what you are doing , " she said .			0
