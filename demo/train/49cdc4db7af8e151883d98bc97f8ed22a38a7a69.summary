@entity1 's prime minister , facing an insurgent @entity3 affiliate and sectarian strife , will appeal to president @entity5 on friday for new assistance from the @entity7 , even as some lawmakers question @entity10 's ability to lead his nation			1
a fresh rise in suicide bombers affiliated with @entity3 has left more than 6,000 people dead this year alone , according to @entity16 estimates			0
violence has been on the upswing : on wednesday , a suicide bomber killed at least nine people and wounded 25 others at a police checkpoint west of @entity23			0
@entity10 is expected to ask for assistance in the form of weapons , equipment and intelligence - sharing in a bid to quell the bloodshed , two years after the @entity7 withdrew almost all its troops from @entity1 after @entity32 refused to renew a security agreement to extend legal immunity for @entity7 forces			1
a bipartisan group of senators harshly criticized @entity10 in a letter to @entity5 on tuesday			0
they wrote that the recent security deterioration in @entity1 was partially the prime minister 's fault , citing what they cast as an exclusionary government			1
" unfortunately , prime minister @entity10 's mismanagement of @entity1 politics is contributing to the recent surge of violence , " the senators wrote			1
signatories included @entity52 @entity51 , @entity53 and @entity54 and democrats @entity55 and @entity56			0
" by too often pursuing a sectarian and authoritarian agenda , prime minister @entity10 and his allies are disenfranchising @entity61 , marginalizing @entity62 , and alienating the many @entity63 who have a democratic , inclusive , and pluralistic vision for their country , " the lawmakers continued			1
@entity10 and @entity1 officials met with vice president @entity68 on wednesday and thursday in @entity69 , where they discussed the current threats			2

" we are talking with the @entity7			0
we are telling them we need to benefit from their experience , from the intelligence information , from training for those who are targeting @entity3 in a developed , technical , scientific way , " he said at the @entity79			0
on friday , @entity5 and @entity10 will continue to hash out ways for @entity1 to better counter fighters associated with the @entity89 , an @entity3 - affiliated group whose leader is thought to be based in war - torn @entity92			2
that effort could include some equipment and weapons sales , and the sharing of intelligence , according to a senior @entity7 administration official , who said @entity1 's current resources do n't allow the nation to effectively target @entity3 insurgents in the western part of the country			1
" what we do n't want the @entity63 to do is just take a security - centric approach to this , " the official said			0
" what that means is making sure they have information in terms of where people are located , where it 's coming from , where the funding is coming from , and that 's something we can do pretty effectively , " the official continued			0
" so we 're trying to help them now as best we can , and that 's going to be a key topic of discussion over the course of the visit			0
" the @entity7 supports separate weapons and air defense systems in @entity1 , and a delivery of @entity7 f - 16 fighter jets is still planned for next fall , the official said , noting that @entity1 had just submitted a deposit of more than $ 600 million after signing a contract last year for them			1
@entity7 officials are also asking @entity1 to do more to end @entity138 shipments to @entity92 's regime that utilize @entity1 airspace , a request originally made by secretary of state @entity142 seven months ago during a surprise visit to @entity32			2
