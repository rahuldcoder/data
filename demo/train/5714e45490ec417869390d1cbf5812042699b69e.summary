-- in advance of friday , the first anniversary of the death of @entity6 's co-founder , we published a story pondering a question many in the tech world have been asking for a while : who will be the next @entity12 ? we put forward seven names , along with pros and cons for each : @entity18 ceo @entity17 , @entity20 ceo @entity19 , @entity6 ceo @entity21 , @entity6 senior vice president @entity22 , @entity24 ceo @entity23 , @entity25 and @entity27 co-founder and @entity29 ceo @entity28 , and @entity30 and @entity32 ceo @entity31			1
what followed was a lively , mostly thoughtful discussion by you , our readers			1
hundreds of people took to the comments section to reflect on @entity12 ' legacy ( the good , the bad and the ugly of it ) and consider the question at hand			1
you gave your opinions on the folks we mentioned , suggested names that we did n't include and pondered whether anyone can ever be another @entity12 -- or whether anyone should be			1
here are some of our favorite comments from the discussion ( with minor tweaks for spelling and grammar )			2
on how our candidates in the story stack up : groo22 @entity28 is fantastic			1
he 's either going to be one of the best ceos ever , or he 's going to burn out with the most inventive vision probably anyone ever had			2
i hope he has success			2
you ca n't compare him to @entity12 though , their goals are not the same			1
@entity65 is way better and may very well cement his name as the best ceo of this generation and possibly this century			2
@entity69 i 'm not much of a techie , but i 'd have to say @entity19 because @entity20 , like @entity6 , has changed the world and the way we do things			1
plus they 're both geeks and started at a very young age , both are arrogant , etc. bhartman36 of the people pictured , i 'd say the " next @entity12 " title has to go to @entity17			1
in fact , i think @entity18 's innovations began to eclipse those of @entity6 even before @entity12 ' death			1
there 's more growth and innovation going on between one generation of @entity88 ( be they e-ink or @entity90 ) to the next than there is between one generation of @entity95 / @entity94 / @entity93 to the next			2
@entity96 @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity23 -- we need products we can touch and experience , not folks running server farms			2
my vote goes to @entity28			2
just like @entity12 , when others pooh - poohed his ideas , he made it happen			1
rkel i would say @entity28			2
the guy truly innovated how we do e-commerce , and @entity29 is another bold idea			0
to say that he has n't changed how we live is shortsighted , considering the effect @entity25 has on commerce and what it has pioneered online			0
it may not be as direct to touch , but most any time i buy something online , he is involved			0
big ideas and big vision , stuff that seems so radical , that is where innovation will come from			0
on whom we left out : njsokalski do n't forget about the other big @entity12 : @entity124 of @entity125			1
@entity125 has started joining the hardware side of the industry along with the software side , and they are also growing in the mobile and consumer parts as well			0
yes , they are still a little bigger with commercial & business customers , but consumers are becoming a bigger part of that			0
also , do n't forget developers			0
i do software , app and web development at home , and that has not only helped keep me as a @entity125 customer , but helped me discover and love even more @entity125 products			0
ayacsa without a doubt it 's @entity147 , the man behind the @entity148 and @entity149 , the company that supports @entity148			0
@entity150 i think the question should be , who will be the next @entity153 ? @entity153 has done more to shape the world than @entity12 could have ever done			1
he has also given back so much more than the greedy @entity12			1
@entity153 has literally saved lives with his generosity			0
@entity157 technologically speaking , @entity153 certainly has done more to advance the current state of technology than any one single person ( that i can think of ) currently living			2
... he may not have been as trendy as @entity12 or had the eye for trendsetting like @entity12 did ( though , even that is arguable , as most of the work was done by @entity6 's fleet of designers ) , but he certainly has a better heart and mind			1
others mentioned : @entity169 and @entity171 co-founder @entity170 , @entity173 creators @entity172 and @entity174 , @entity176 ceo @entity175 and , for reasons we ca n't quite comprehend , @entity179			2
there wo n't ( or should n't ) be another @entity12 : @entity181 there is no one as complex , demanding , quirky or brilliant -- all wrapped up in one package -- as @entity12			1
wo n't be another like him			0
@entity186 we really do n't need another @entity12			1
@entity188 we need another @entity189 , another @entity190 , a lot more @entity192 , another @entity193 , more ( @entity194 ) @entity195 , @entity196 , beethovens , @entity198 ... and @entity199 ! seriously , @entity12 is way overrated			1
even as a manager he sucked			0
i have sort of a theory of an era that begins with @entity206 's soup cans and ends with @entity12 ' death			1
to me , @entity206 's soup can art conveyed the idea of the iconic image of a physical product living on its own , becoming disembodied			0
@entity12 and @entity6 became the real - world realization of that			1
we are at the point where there really is n't anything new to invent in this area			0
bluewaters4567 was there the next @entity220 ? was there the next @entity189 ? was there the next ( scientist @entity223 ? why should there be a next @entity12 ? the beauty of creation is that it never produces duplicates			1
that is what we do			0
@entity231 there are brilliant scientists among us right now creating remarkable things : advanced cybernetics , nanotech , @entity237 , better medicines			0
if you mean a person who will make new - looking computers and phones , it will be someone we have n't seen yet or have n't been paying attention to			0
definitely wo n't be @entity19 , @entity17 or @entity246			0
there will always be a new torchbearer			0
... they could show up tomorrow .			0

friday will be the first anniversary of the death of @entity6 co-founder @entity12
