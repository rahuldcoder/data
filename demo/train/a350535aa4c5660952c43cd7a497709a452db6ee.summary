-- toy manufacturer @entity1 , famous for its small plastic stackable bricks , is not allowed to register one of them as its trademark , the @entity6 has ruled			1
the @entity9 company was granted a trademark for a three - dimensional image of a red eight - stud brick in 1999 , for use throughout the @entity14			1
@entity16 toy manufacturer @entity15 , which makes similar plastic bricks , argued that @entity1 violated trademark legislation , and the @entity6 in @entity19 ruled in favor of @entity15 on tuesday			1
" this was the court of final instance , and we have no option but to note the court 's ruling , " said @entity21 , the head of @entity1 's @entity22			2
the ruling can not be appealed			0
the issue was whether the famous @entity1 brick served a technical function			1
@entity35 law says companies can trademark graphic images like words , designs , the shape of their goods and packaging -- but trademarking a product 's shape , if that shape is " necessary to obtain a technical result , " is not allowed , the court said			0
@entity1 argued that did not apply to its brick , because " bricks with virtually the same function can have other appearances , " @entity21 said			1
in making its decision , the court referred to an earlier case involving the electronics makers @entity54 and @entity56 over the shape of an electric razor			0
" patents can protect technical solutions , such as the means to interconnect toy bricks , but patent protection is limited in time and @entity1 's patents for the basic brick have long expired , " @entity15 said in a statement after the ruling			1
" put simply , a trademark registration can not be used to confer a potentially everlasting monopoly on a useful product configuration			0
" @entity21 said the decision will confuse @entity1 customers			2
" it is naturally a matter of concern to us that use of the brick by others can dilute the trademark , " he said			2
" but the worst aspect is that consumers will be misled			0
analyses show that 40 - 60 percent of shoppers believe they are buying a @entity1 product when in fact they are purchasing a different product			0
shoppers can see there is a different name on the box , but they believe it is a product line or company owned by us			0

@entity1 may not trademark its *iconic* plastic brick
@entity16 toy maker @entity15 said it violated trademark laws
