-- every country has an unofficial doctrine -- a mantra if you will			0
in @entity6 , it 's the " independent spirit			2
" in @entity8 , it 's the " no - nonsense work ethic			2
" in @entity10 , well , in @entity10 it was always " laughter through adversity			1
@entity12 , one of @entity10 's most beloved comedic actors , was sentenced to jail for insulting @entity15			1
not for something he said but for roles he played in films			2
yes , you read that right			0
that 's like sentencing @entity21 to life in prison for his role in " @entity25 " what makes this court ruling even more preposterous is that these films are not recent films			1
they are pre-revolution films that were approved by the former government			1
last week a court upheld a three - month prison sentence given to the 71 - year old actor in february for " insulting " @entity15 in his films " @entity38 " and " @entity39			1
" it was one of two cases brought against him by an @entity44 lawyer , although the second case was last week overturned , according to @entity46			0
as a child , i remember watching @entity50 films when i visited my family in @entity10 during summer break			1
even with my broken @entity53 , his mix of wit , facial expressions and physical humor amused me endlessly			0
@entity10 have long been envied for their ability to tell a joke			1
over the decades they created films , television series and plays that delighted audiences across the region			0
one can say that in @entity73 , a city with nearly 20 million people living in a space the size of my bedroom , it 's impossible to get by without a sense of humor			0

and if it collapses , i firmly believe so does @entity10 's hope for a better future			1
as an @entity10 - @entity6 comedian , i had the opportunity to be part of the rise of stand - up comedy in the region			1
during my first show in @entity73 , maybe four or five years ago , i remember one local comedian was so nervous because he thought he " might be arrested " by the government just for telling jokes			1
earlier this year i had the opportunity to produce the first stand - up comedy show @entity95 revolution			0
i remember the buzz in the air as comedians made light of a tense situation -- the ouster of @entity103 and the uncertainty of the country			2
as a performer , i was able to address , for the first time in my shows , sexual harassment and the religious hypocrisy of " complete religious freedom as long as you 're @entity113 or @entity114			0
" we even had a female comedian wearing hijab perform on stage			0
the progression of the country in such a short time period was mind boggling			0
who would have guessed that the limited freedom of speech afforded to @entity10 under the old regime would develop into no freedom of speech at all ? that a country , which was the " beacon of hope " less than one year ago , is now a catalyst for a " return to the dark ages			2
" see also : comedian stands up for @entity134 ' right to laugh i 'm not saying that we should n't be sensitive to religious and cultural needs -- though my personal vote as a comedian is everything should be open to criticism and satire			0
many countries have restrictions on programming , including the @entity6 , but to retroactively punish someone for previously approved material is beyond reason			0
mr. @entity12 has the opportunity to appeal but , regardless of if he wins or not , a clear message has been sent : any challenge to the " societal norm " will not be tolerated			2
this does n't just prevent comedians , writers and artists from finding humor in the single biggest aspect of every @entity10 's life but it also will suppress creativity in general			1
can a @entity113 character in a film not drink alcohol ? it happens everyday in real life but are we not allowed to show it because the courts want us to pretend it does n't exist ? more importantly , what happens to that actor playing the part -- even if he is really drinking apple juice instead of a beer ? regardless of the outcome in the @entity12 trial , if @entity10 do n't raise their voices against this ridiculous verdict , this may not just signal the demise of comedy in @entity10 -- this could very well be the demise of the country itself			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

@entity10 actor @entity12 found *guilty* of *defaming* @entity15 in some of his movies
the films are several years old and were approved by former *president* @entity103 's *censors*
comedian @entity189 says verdict will suppress creativity in @entity10
