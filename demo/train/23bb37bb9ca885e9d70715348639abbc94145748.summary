@entity0 -- @entity4 ceo @entity3 's latest charm offensive with @entity5 has generated decidedly mixed reviews			1
last week , he hosted a senior @entity5 official whose office is responsible for banning @entity4 -- along with other popular sites like @entity10 and @entity11 -- in @entity5			1
in photos posted on @entity13 , a government - run web portal , top internet regulator @entity16 is seen seated in @entity3 's chair at @entity4 's @entity20 campus while holding a book with @entity5 president @entity23 's portrait adorning its cover			1
the accompanying text explains that , when @entity16 found a copy of " @entity23 : the governance of @entity5 " on @entity3 's desk , the young billionaire told the smiling @entity29 cadre in @entity30 : " i also bought this book for my colleagues -- i want them to understand socialism with @entity5 characteristics			1
" that quote has quickly gone viral online , along with a propaganda poster - style image that features @entity3 in a @entity5 soldier 's uniform clutching @entity23 's book to his chest			1
@entity4 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
kowtowing ? @entity5 internet users have reacted with as much surprise and amusement as ridicule and disapproval			2
some sound sympathetic to @entity3 's strong desire to crack @entity5 's internet market , the world 's largest and a gaping hole in @entity4 's global reach			1
" he 's a smart guy -- to conquer that market means to cooperate with the @entity5 government and make money together , " wrote one @entity11 user			2
others , however , feel betrayed by @entity3 's apparent kowtowing to @entity0 authorities , who have built one of the world 's most extensive internet filtering and censorship systems to restrict speech and crush dissent online			2
" even if you have read all the books by @entity23 or ( late paramount leaders ) @entity78 or @entity79 , it 's not going to help you in @entity5 , " said another commenter			0
" you 're already late in the game and then there is censorship -- it would make more sense for you to work with @entity85 to end internet censorship			0
" @entity5 smitten ? @entity5 's state media has been smitten with @entity3 since his october visit to @entity0 , where he wowed students at an elite university by answering their questions in accented but fluent @entity30			2
to rousing applause , the 30 - year - old internet entrepreneur said he took on the challenge of studying @entity30 to communicate with his wife 's family and to better appreciate the @entity5 culture			0
he also traded his signature hoodie - and - jeans look for a suit and tie when he met @entity102 member @entity101 -- one of seven men who effectively rule the country -- at a heavily guarded leadership compound just west of @entity106			0
" @entity101 and @entity16 should be @entity3 's sponsors for joining the @entity29 and @entity23 can grant his immediate approval for admission , " tweeted @entity107 , one of @entity5 's most prominent political dissidents , upon learning the @entity4 co-founder 's remarks to @entity16 about @entity23 's book			1
" i once held up a sign that said ' regimes that block @entity4 wo n't last long , ' " he added			0
" now i 'm afraid @entity3 is making a deal or even forming an alliance with the enemy of the @entity120			0
" for @entity107 and others , no @entity4 at all is preferable to a @entity4 with @entity5 characteristics .			0
