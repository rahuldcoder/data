-- shark attacks were up last year , according to the @entity2 , but before you put that @entity5 timeshare on the market , please realize the numbers , statistically , are kind of meaningless			1
then why on @entity8 is @entity0 writing about this , you ask ? because research shows you like sharks and are prone to consume stories about their more violent sides			2
what is less clear is why			0
despite the popularity of shark attack stories , the actual odds of a hammerhead latching on to your midsection during a morning swim are minuscule , especially when you consider that your toilet and the neighbor 's dog pose far more risk to you			1
you should also consider that if sharks had fancy news websites like @entity0 , their pages would likely be rife with ( " @entity29 " - dropping ? ) headlines about the estimated 30 million to 70 million of them that we kill every year			2
to be sure , sharks killed seven of us worldwide last year , according to monday 's @entity2 report			1
" shark attack as a phenomenon is extremely uncommon , considering the millions of hours humans spend in the water each year , " @entity36 , director of the @entity37 of @entity38 at the state 's @entity39 , said in a news release			2
shark seriously injures @entity48 surfer let 's have a look at the numbers , and we 'll get back to the dangers of that toilet			1
there were 80 unprovoked attacks last year worldwide			0
an unprovoked attack is one in which the shark strikes first , as opposed to a provoked attack that often comes when a fisherman is trying to land one of the beasts with a hook or net			2
@entity66 marked a slight uptick from 2011			0
however , in the @entity69 , there were 53 attacks , the most since 2000			0
also concerning to researchers is that for consecutive years there have been multiple attacks in western @entity74 ( five in 2012 ) and off @entity75 ( three in 2012 ) , located about 400 miles east of @entity76			0
another startling statistic is that of the four attacks in @entity79 last year , three were fatal			0
that 's a 75 % fatality rate , as opposed to a 22 % rate worldwide and a 2 % rate in the @entity69 , where most shark attacks occur			2
it 's not that @entity79 shark varieties are any fiercer ; the numbers are more likely a product of " superior safety and medical capabilities in the @entity69 , " @entity36 said			1
surfer dies after shark attack here is a rundown of the @entity69 attacks : -- @entity96 led the way at 26 , with @entity99 and @entity100 counties tallying eight and seven , respectively ; -- then came @entity102 with 10 ; -- @entity48 and @entity103 were next with five each ; -- @entity104 registered two ; -- and @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 each had one			1
" the numbers from an international standpoint were on target for the last couple of years because , in theory , each year we should have more attacks than the previous year owing to the rise of human population from year to year , " @entity36 said			2
most of those attacked , 60 % , were surfers , while swimmers and divers composed another 30 % of the incidents			0
that does n't mean you need to hang up your longboard or regulator			0
" shark attacks are rare and it does n't matter whether you call them attacks or bites or bumps -- your chances of having any of them are slim , " @entity36 said			2
how slim ? the @entity137 has a host of phenomena that are more likely than a shark attack , and @entity141 in 2011 put together a list of things that are more likely to injure you			0
among them : -- since 1948 , those in any @entity69 state with alligators had a better chance of being killed by one of the reptiles , which had killed 18 people as of 2005 , than they did of suffering a fatal shark attack			1
conversely , those folks still had a slightly better chance of a nonfatal shark attack			0
-- between 1985 and 2010 , @entity157 were almost 21 times as likely to be killed by a tornado ( 125 deaths ) as by a shark ( six )			1
between 1990 and 2009 , the state also saw 2,272 bicycle deaths , compared to four from sharks			0
-- in the coastal @entity69 , lightning killed almost 76 times as many people ( 1,970 ) as did sharks ( 26 ) between 1959 and 2010			1
-- from 2001 to 2010 , dogs killed more than 26 times the number of people ( 263 ) than did sharks ( 10 ) in the @entity69 -- between 1984 and 1987 , @entity107 had almost 1,600 incidents annually of humans biting other humans			1
that 's not really germane to this story so much as it is plain odd			0
-- sand - hole collapses are n't generally considered among the greatest threats in the @entity69 , as they killed only 16 people between 1990 and 2006 -- but that 's still five more people than sharks killed			1
-- in 1996 , toilets injured 43,000 @entity69 , buckets and pails hurt almost 11,000 and room fresheners were responsible for 2,600 injuries in the nation			0
sharks injured 13 people that same year			1
( there are a variety of toilet - related injuries : seats can fall , smashing boys ' genitalia mid-micturition ; cracks in toilet seats can pinch a user 's buttocks ; and , as the ladies have explained time and time again , gentlemen , leaving the toilet seat up can cause folks to crash into the toilet bowl , damaging their buttocks and / or tailbones			0
) while it ca n't always be said that you have a better chance of winning the lottery than being the victim of a shark attack -- it depends on which type of lottery and how many people are playing -- it seems certain you 're better served watching out for that commode than for fins on the water			1

@entity2 issues new statistics , but numbers can be *misleading*
you 're more likely to be injured by a toilet or sand hole collapse than by a shark
dogs killed almost 26 times as many people as sharks in first decade of 21st century
