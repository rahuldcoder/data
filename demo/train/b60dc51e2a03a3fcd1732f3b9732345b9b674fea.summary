-- the @entity2 primary will tell us a good deal more than the @entity6 caucuses did about where the @entity8 candidates stand and how they might do in the general election against president @entity11			1
while the unpredictable nature of the @entity6 caucuses offered @entity14 an opportunity to shine , tuesday 's vote will tell us where the party is really headed , in what has been a @entity18 of a presidential selection process , one with more ups and downs than the @entity22			1
the @entity2 primary , established in 1916 , has a long and treasured history in @entity26 politics			1
it has often been the site where new voices have been able to upset the status quo and take on establishment figures			1
in 1952 , the military hero @entity31 successfully challenged " mr. @entity32 " @entity32 , the senator from @entity33 , who was thought to be one of the strongest figures in the party			0
that same year , @entity39 sen. @entity38 shook up the @entity40 by winning a stunning victory against president @entity42 , fueling his decision not to run for re-election			0
in 1968 , @entity47 sen. @entity46 's strong second - place showing similarly upset president @entity48 , forcing him to think twice about how strong his support was within the @entity40			1
the results , sen. @entity51 recalled , demonstrated that " overnight , @entity48 had become beatable			0
" a few weeks later @entity48 told the nation that he would not run for re-election			0
in 1976 , the little - known @entity54 built on his surprise victory in the @entity6 caucuses by winning in @entity2 and cementing his status as a front - runner			1
@entity8 @entity59 revealed the soft support among conservatives in 1992 for president @entity62 , whom @entity59 derided as " @entity63 , " when he did better than expected against the president ( though @entity62 won )			0
to be sure , the outcome of the primary is not always a measure of who will win the party 's nomination			0
there is a substantial list of @entity2 losers -- including @entity11 in 2008 , @entity74 in 2000 , @entity75 in 1992 , and @entity76 in 1984 -- who went on to receive party nominations			1
most important , @entity2 is a state where independents matter very much and turn out in large numbers			2
the primary allows unaffiliated voters to participate , thus boosting the number of participants from the middle of the political spectrum			2
with the base of each party relatively deflated about the choices in 2012 ( liberal @entity40 are disappointed in @entity11 's record , while conservatives are not overly enthused about any of the front - runners ) , the 2012 election will likely come down to the person who can capture the center			0
with @entity11 's approval ratings at a low ebb , republicans have a major opportunity if they can win the hearts and minds of independents and centrist @entity40			0
one of @entity103 's biggest selling points is that he offers the @entity8 the only candidate who can run as a moderate who is not beholden to the party 's base			2
during one of the weekend debates he brushed back talk about making contraception illegal and tried to focus on his economic policy rather than social and cultural issues			0
he left the others to fight it out as to who was a " big - government conservative " and who was not			0
in @entity2 , @entity103 will have the first chance to show that his appeal to centrists is a strength			1
republicans in @entity2 tend to fit the profile of the kind of conservative candidate who will have the greatest national appeal			2
while @entity8 activists are often attracted to the candidate who can speak the language of the religious right , the @entity8 with the best chance of taking @entity11 in this election will be the fiscal conservative who pushes for lowering the deficit , lowering spending , and containing taxes , while avoiding the cultural issues that turn off moderates			0
in 2008 , according to @entity140 , only 23 % of the @entity2 electorate said they were evangelicals , compared with 58 % in @entity6 this year			1
finally , @entity2 looks more like a national election than does @entity6			1
while @entity26 like to think our political process works by retail politics , with candidates shaking hands and enjoying a meal at the local diner , the reality is that elections are won or lost on major media -- television , radio and the @entity155			1
the candidate who has the best ability to mount a national campaign is the person who can master the media , handling reporters and the 24 - hour news cycle , and can amass the kind of money that is needed to buy tv ads in @entity2			2
it is simply not possible to win the state only by shaking hands			0
a candidate has to be able to do well on the screen			0
this is a year when @entity2 's verdict will be key in evaluating the @entity8 field			2
the test is not completely fair in that @entity103 comes from this region and even has a home in this state			1
that said , being local is not a guarantee of victory			0
while a close victory in @entity6 was certainly something that @entity103 can live with , he needs to have a very strong showing in @entity2 to demonstrate that he is as electable a candidate as he has promised to be			1
he has to answer the kind of challenge posed in sunday 's debate , when @entity187 said @entity103 would " have a very hard time getting elected " in a race against @entity11			1
at the same time , this is a major opportunity for @entity103 's opponents ( especially @entity191 ) to show that they fit the bill as well , and that the prospect of @entity103 winning the nomination is not inevitable			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : @entity6 gave @entity14 *prominence* but @entity2 vote is likely to be more revealing
he says the primary will test whether @entity103 is strong with centrist voters
the primary has been a place to challenge establishment figures , @entity197 says
@entity197 : *unlike* @entity6 , @entity2 is *n't* decided by retail politics
