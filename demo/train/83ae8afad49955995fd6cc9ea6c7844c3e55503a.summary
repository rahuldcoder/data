-- the arrest of 19 protesters at a rancorous school board meeting tuesday brings the issue of busing and diversity in education into the national spotlight			1
the @entity9 of the @entity10 and local @entity11 held a mass mobilization march tuesday in @entity13 , @entity14 , to protest the recent decision by the @entity16 to end a 10 - year - old socioeconomic diversity plan for public schools			1
the school board voted 5 - 4 on march 23 to end " forced busing , " a method initiated in the 1970s to promote diversity in public schools			1
nearly 1000 people , including members of local church , community and advocacy groups , gathered at the @entity29 and marched to the state capitol , according to local police and other officials			2
the rev. @entity33 , president of the @entity14 state conference of the @entity10 , said the groups rallied to raise awareness about the importance of diversity in public schools			1
" it 's time that the @entity42 officials wake up and realize how a model for resegregation will damage not only our state , but the basic principles of our nation , " @entity33 said			2
" it 's time to say no to resegregation and say yes to diversity and school excellence			2
" 19 arrested at school board meeting the @entity42 , which includes @entity13 , is the 18th largest school district in the nation			1
in the 1950s , the @entity57 @entity56 ruled that separate and unequal school systems were unconstitutional			0
@entity14 schools have been a national model for education since the @entity62 vs. @entity64 case in 1971			1
the @entity65 became the first district ordered by the @entity57 @entity56 to implement busing as a way to desegregate classrooms			0
in 1999 , the @entity70 ruled the @entity73 - @entity72 district had achieved a healthy level of racial integration , and race - based busing was no longer required			1
" the federal courts eliminated their oversight of the @entity73 busing system because the schools had achieved " an equal balance in terms of race , said @entity78 , senior managing attorney for the @entity80 's @entity79			2
" since that time , the state has gone backwards and now several counties are as segregated as they were before [ busing ]			0
" as other counties ended busing and returned to neighborhood schools , the @entity42 transformed the legislation in 1999 , moving away from the traditional race - based integration policy and replacing it with a socioeconomic diversity program			1
this plan attempted to balance the proportion of wealthy and poor students at county schools by moving students around , with a busing system based on the percentage of children that received subsidized lunches			2
to foster this diversity , some students traveled an hour from their homes to school , and some suburban students were bused to inner - city schools			1
parents frustrated by long drives and bus routes elected a school board that opposed the 1999 policy and imposed a new plan for neighborhood - based schools			1
the new plan requires students to go to schools in their communities , often leaving black students in underachieving schools and white students in higher quality schools , @entity78 said			0
now some fear that the county that was once a desegregation model for the nation will bring back segregation that will spread throughout the state			0
" this is not just a local issue , but a national one , " said @entity135 , @entity80 education fellow and attorney			0
" other school districts are on the edge of their seats , waiting to see what @entity143 plans , before they make decisions on whether socioeconomic diversity should be reconsidered			2
" the rally on tuesday was a call for attention to an issue that could spread like cancer , @entity33 said			0
" we want a real community -- one community , where every child is cared for , " he said			0
" we know what resegregation looks like			0
and the last place we want it is in the @entity159 again			0
" some concerned citizens of @entity143 fully support the plan for community - based schools			1
@entity163 , president of the @entity164 , which helped elect the majority members on the school board , believes that the outrage over community schools is unfounded			1
" this has absolutely nothing to do with race , nothing to do with resegregation			0
it has to do with fixing what is not working , " @entity163 said			0
she says minority students are graduating at a rate much lower than average in the current busing system			0
only 51 percent of @entity180 and 63 percent of african - americans graduated from schools in @entity143 , compared to an overall graduation rate of 78 percent , according to the @entity42			1
" when people get emotional , they get scared and afraid and believe whatever people are filling in their heads			0
what we need to do is come together to figure out what is best for our kids , " @entity163 said			0
according to @entity42 officials , the decision to stop busing is based purely on population dynamics and educational improvement -- not race			1
" the extensive growth over the past two decades " has resulted in the need for " numerous adjustments " and created " challenges to meet demand and efficiency , " the board said in a statement			0
community - based assignments , they said , would not only ensure equity in each school zone , but would also provide " all students at all schools with an equal opportunity to a sound , basic education , " a fundamental right under @entity14 state law			1
@entity33 said the school board 's decision is not constitutional and is a practice that will lead to educational failure			2
" neighborhood - schools [ policy ] not only separates bodies , it separates the budget , the buildings , the teachers -- basically , all the building blocks of education , " he said			2
" what you end up with is a district that 's high in poverty , high in turnover , and high in underachievement			0
" @entity42 officials will develop school assignments based on community zones within the next 9 to 15 months .			1
