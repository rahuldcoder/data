-- for many travelers , duty - free is a luxurious enigma wrapped up in discounted @entity4 chocolate and soaked in tax - free vodka			1
duty - free goods are mostly sold inside international airport terminals , ferry stations , cruise ports , and border stops			1
duty - free shops sell products without local import tax			1
as the name implies , duty - free shops sell products without duty ( a.k.a. local import tax )			1
for example , by buying goods in a duty - free shop at @entity22 's @entity21 , you avoid paying the duty that @entity24 slaps on imported goods ( like @entity27 vodka ) and that @entity24 stores ordinarily include as part of a product 's list price			1
in @entity33 , there 's a bonus perk : duty - free shops in airports and ports are " tax - free shops , " too , which means you are spared the value added tax ( or @entity40 , a type of sales tax ) that would otherwise be included in the price of goods sold elsewhere in the @entity45			1
that means a savings of between 5 and 25 percent , depending on the country			0
but there 's a catch for duty - free products bought in @entity33 and elsewhere			2
if you bring into the @entity53 more than $ 800 worth of items purchased abroad -- duty - free or not -- you 'll have to pay the @entity53 duty			1
as a rule of thumb , @entity53 returning from overseas trips must pay 3 percent on the first $ 1,000 worth of merchandise over the $ 800 allowance			0
import products worth even more than that and you may be taxed at a higher percentage			0
in short , duty - free is hit - or - miss for @entity53			1
the best deals are on items labeled " tax free " and otherwise taxed heavily -- such as alcohol and cigarettes			1
you may also find it worthwhile to shop in duty - free stores if you have some local currency left and would rather put it to use than redeem it for dollars ( and get hit with the high conversion fee of a bank or currency exchange bureau )			1
not every duty - free item is a true bargain			2
@entity80 , president of the duty - free research company @entity81 , says price differences depend on two things : geography and currency exchange rates			2
" right now , @entity86 and @entity87 in @entity88 offer good deals , especially for liquor , because of the weak @entity92 pound , " he says			0
for example , a one - liter bottle of @entity95 vodka has a typical non-duty - free price of about $ 30 at retail @entity53 shops			2
but travelers can buy it for just $ 15 ( £ 10 ) at duty free shops at @entity88 's @entity86 and @entity87 airports			0
that 's a significant savings			0
we found impressive discounts on booze elsewhere , too			0
one liter of @entity95 sells for $ 17.50 ( € 13.50 ) at duty - free shops at @entity109 's and @entity111 's main international airports , and for a bit more elsewhere , such as in @entity113 ( $ 18.50 , or 399 @entity115 koruna ) and @entity116 ( $ 21 , or € 16 )			1
those prices offer substantial savings off the $ 30 benchmark price at a typical @entity53 retail store			0
but be aware that @entity53 states may restrict how much alcohol you may import duty - free			1
there 's a typical one - liter limit for all types of alcohol per person , though the rule depends on your state of residence and the country you 've visited			0
( one exception : you can return from a visit to a @entity137 country with up to two liters of alcohol duty - free			2
) cigarettes offer similar savings			0
@entity87 's duty - free shop sells a carton of @entity143 for $ 36 ( £ 24 )			2
the same carton goes for $ 27 ( € 20 ) at the airport in @entity109			0
in @entity150 -- the state with the highest cigarette tax in the nation -- a carton of @entity143 goes for about $ 80			0
in a state with more - typical cigarette taxes , @entity153 , the price of a carton is $ 44 -- still higher than in duty - free shops			1
( note : @entity53 customs law allows you to import only up to 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars , whether you bought them at a duty - free shop or not			1
) but not everything in the duty - free shop is a steal			2
duty - free stories once specialized in heavily taxed items , such as alcohol and tobacco products , but now they hawk other products that are n't as deeply discounted			1
when shopping for cosmetics and fragrances -- which account for almost one third of all duty - free sales -- you need to shop with savvy and persistence			1
a 1.7 - liter bottle of @entity178 , for example , costs $ 46 ( £ 31 ) at duty free shops at @entity87 while the @entity180 in @entity181 retails it for $ 59			0
that 's a savings of almost 25 percent			0
luxury goods -- defined in duty - free stores as high - end watches , designer - name handbags , and the like -- account for 36 percent of duty - free sales			2
but you need to comparison shop for these products to make sure that an item is truly on sale			0
a case in point : @entity196 's @entity195 , a duty - free shopping area , sells the @entity198 for $ 450 ( hk $ 3,500 )			1
but shoppers can buy the same bag off @entity202 's website for about the same price ( or , when we checked , on sale for $ 285 )			0
in the end , if an item is n't liquor or cigarettes , be wary , and come prepared			0
says @entity210 , author of " @entity211 : how to get the @entity212 , " " if you know the price of something back home and you go to a duty - free store , you can compare and know what the bargain might be			2
" consider that @entity220 sells duty - free products on board many of its planes , and a few items are truly discounted			1
a @entity225 sells for $ 72 , which is a savings of $ 18 off the price at a @entity229 store			0
