-- two decades of satellite readings back up what dramatic pictures have suggested in recent years : the mile - thick ice sheets that cover @entity5 and most of @entity6 are melting at a faster rate in a warming world			1
that 's the conclusion of an international network of scientists who released their review of one of the biggest question marks in climate science thursday			2
the net loss of billions of tons of ice a year added about 11 millimeters -- seven - sixteenths of an inch -- to global average sea levels between 1992 and 2011 , about 20 % of the increase during that time , those researchers reported			1
while that 's a small number , " small changes in sea levels in certain places mean very big changes in the kind of protection of infrastructure that you need to have in place , " said @entity35 , a geophysicist at @entity37 's @entity36 in @entity38 and one of the contributors to thursday 's study			1
chasing down the world 's vanishing glaciers long - term climate change fueled by a buildup of atmospheric carbon emissions is a controversial notion politically , but it 's one accepted as fact by most scientists			2
previous estimates of how much the @entity5 and @entity6 ice sheets contributed to the current 3 millimeter - per - year rise in sea levels have varied widely , and the 2007 report of the @entity56 ' @entity55 left the question open			1
while the 19 - year average worked out to about 20 % of the rise of the oceans , " for recent years it goes up to about 30 or 40 % , " said @entity62 , a professor of polar meteorology at @entity64 in the @entity65			2
the rest comes from thermal expansion -- warmer water takes up more space			0
the research released thursday was backed by the @entity71 , @entity37 , the @entity72 and research councils in @entity74 and the @entity65 , with the findings published in this week 's edition of the peer - reviewed journal @entity78			0
the project involved 47 scientists who compared readings from various satellite - based methods , including radar and laser readings and measurements of the minute gravitational changes around the ice sheets			1
they concluded that @entity5 and two of the three ice sheets that cover @entity6 have lost an estimated 237 billion metric tons , give or take a few billion , in the past 19 years			1
the ice sheet that covers eastern @entity6 grew , but only by about 14 billion tons -- not nearly enough to offset the losses from the layer that covers the western portion of the continent and the @entity96			1
" @entity6 is losing mass , but it 's not losing as much mass as many of the reports had suggested , " @entity35 said			1
" @entity5 , on the other hand , is losing more mass today than it was in 1990 by a factor of five			1
" satellites reveal rare levels of @entity5 ice melt do n't panic : at the current rate , it would take between 3,000 and 7,000 years for those regions to become ice - free , said @entity110 , a glaciologist at the @entity111			1
" but we can see that the trend is towards increases , and that that 's something we do need to worry about , " @entity110 said			0
" and that if we really want to have meaningful information that , you know , planners can use to build seawalls and things , there 's going to have to be a big push to improve our projections of sea level rise using models			0
" in july , researchers watched as a stretch of unusually warm temperatures melted nearly the entire surface of the @entity5 ice sheet			2
the study 's lead author , @entity132 of @entity74 's @entity133 , said the results are the clearest evidence that the ice sheets are losing ground and are intended to be the benchmark for climate scientists to use for future calculations			1
with environmental spotlight on @entity5 , more tourists want closer look " any model that someone would use to predict sea level rise is only really as good as the data that goes into it , " @entity144 said			2
" and the fact that our data is twice or three times as reliable as the most recent overarching assessment has to give some weight to improving the value of those model predictions in the future			0
" @entity159 , a @entity37 climatologist who was not part of the study , said the data collected could be used to fine - tune computer models of future climate change			0
but he said scientists need to learn more about the physics and mechanics of the ice sheets before developing effective projections of what effect they 'll have on continued sea - level rise			1
" right now , all of that is very complicated stuff , and we 're not at the point where all of that is integrated into the models we have now , " @entity159 said			0
the findings were published as representatives of @entity56 member states are gathered in @entity182 in hopes of hammering out a successor to the @entity185 , the 1997 pact aimed at reining in carbon emissions			0
that pact committed developing nations to reduce emissions with a goal of limiting the rise of global average temperatures to 2 degrees c ( 3.6 f ) by 2100			0
but global emissions have gone up by about 50 % since @entity196 , the @entity194 reported last week			0
the pact largely exempted developing nations like @entity198 and @entity199 , now the no. 1 and no. 3 emitters			0
the no. 2 producer -- the @entity203 -- never ratified @entity196			0

the loss of @entity5 and @entity6 ice is *speeding* up , scientists find
the study gives the clearest picture of polar melting to date , the lead author says
the ice sheets have added about 11 mm to global sea levels since 1992
@entity5 is losing ice five times faster than it was in the 1990s , the study finds
