-- technology has been changing the way we access , enjoy and discuss our entertainment			0
from smartphones and tablets with streaming movies to video game consoles offering tv shows alongside game play , consumers have increasingly become accustomed to their entertainment colliding and intertwining in new and interesting ways			1
in an effort to expand that world , the creators of " @entity16 " are banking on the combined power of an online third - person shooter video game and a weekly science fiction television series to keep fans hooked and actively involved in the franchise			1
@entity24 and @entity25 joined forces five years ago to create " a truly unique entertainment experience , " according to @entity28 , vp of development for @entity24 and executive producer of " @entity16			1
" the " @entity16 " world is set in the year 2046 on a transformed @entity32 ravaged by conflict and alien attacks			1
mutants , evil alien races and robots terrorize what 's left of civilization and those who have the wealth and power have fled to @entity42 -- the last refuge for those who want to live comfortably			2
the game takes place in the @entity47 area while the tv series is set in @entity49 , or what used to be @entity49 before alien terraforming technology destroyed most of the city			1
the town is now called @entity16 , with a population of about 6,000 people of different races			1
creators say the geographic split of the story was necessary so each property could stand on its own			0
@entity61 , president of original content at @entity25 , said a gaming world where hundreds of players are completing missions would n't be a good environment for tv storytelling			2
" we really did need to keep them distinct and not worry about what we could and could n't do , " @entity61 said			0
" we did n't want lots of people running up and down our streets ( in @entity49 ) shooting everything			1
it was going to be very , very hard to keep those things separate in that very specific way			0
" that 's not to say the show and the game are completely separate			1
events that happen in the game will refer to , and possibly affect , things in the tv series and vice versa			1
@entity86 , senior producer at @entity24 , points out the two main characters from the show , @entity16 and @entity89 , actually appear in the game before they show up in the series and go on missions with the player			1
" those two characters leave the game , " @entity86 said			1
" they drive away from the player having gotten an object the player helped them get and then drive into the television show			2
( they ) end up using that object , which really helps the solution to the pilot ( episode )			0
" the game , which is available on the @entity109 and @entity110 consoles as well as @entity112 - based computers , launched two weeks before the @entity25 series premier to give fans of the " @entity16 " universe a taste of what was to come in the show			1
however , you do n't have to watch the show to understand the game -- and vice versa			1
@entity86 said the game and the show can stand alone , but the idea of expanding the world through different outlets at the same time was something they felt would enhance the viewer 's , or player 's , enjoyment of the franchise			1
" you 'll be missing a lot of background of what maybe happens from either the show or the game , he said			2
" it wo n't be something you are confused by			0
it wo n't be ' why did that just happen ? ' ( but ) if you play the game and are watching the show , you might have an inner knowledge that other people wo n't have about the show			2
" while both teams were telling a story in the same universe , @entity61 said the creative process was like digging a tunnel through opposite sides of a mountain to meet in the center			0
" they 're ( @entity24 ) building this deep , rich world and we were trying to create interesting character drama , " @entity61 said			0
" that was a great benefit to us to have a company working 24 hours a day building out this detail , like a 300 - page world @entity164 , that we could tap when it did become time for us to worry about ( questions like ) ' what color are the trees ? ' ' what do the buildings exactly look like ? ' " @entity86 agreed , saying @entity24 pushed @entity25 to think about larger details earlier when the show producers wanted to work in character details			2
" we need to define a universe early because our entire game is computer - generated graphics and they take a long time to build			2
they usually think about what the universe looks like , what it sounds like , and they usually figure that out after they 've got an initial script written , " he said			0
while some of the discussion about story development , environments and the overall reach of " @entity16 " got heated , the idea of making something brand new kept both sides focused			2
@entity61 said there was genuine enthusiasm on both sides to make it work , but the pressure was intense			0
" there 's so much scrutiny because of what it is , " he said			2
" there 's also this real responsibility feel that , if this does n't work , you 've condemned the idea in general , which is not necessarily fair			0
" are science fiction and gaming fans ready for this type of multilayered entertainment ? the crossover audience between those two genres seems to be a natural and large one			0
" ( the @entity25 show ) is only on for an hour a week and 13 episodes a season , and then people have to wait for the next season , " @entity86 points out			0
" the fan base really gets into the universe behind these television shows and they do n't get to live in it outside of those 13 episodes			0
we give them the opportunity to come into the game and live in the universe 24/7 if they want to			0
" " @entity16 " ( the game ) is available now for the @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity112			1
it is an online game so it does require an internet connection to play at all times			0
it is rated m for mature due to blood , drug references , sexual themes , strong language , and violence			0
" @entity16 " ( the show ) premiered april 15 on the @entity25 channel and will run weekly until july 8 .			1

" @entity16 " launched as both a video game and tv show
@entity247 neither depends on the other , but that they accent each other
characters from a mission in the game later appear on the show
the game is set in *futuristic* @entity256 , while the show 's in @entity49
