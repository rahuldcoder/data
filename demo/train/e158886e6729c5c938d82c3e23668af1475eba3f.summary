-- president @entity1 has made it clear to @entity3 that if they will not work with him he will work around them			1
before the @entity8 address , the president announced that he was increasing the minimum wage for workers under federal contract to $ 10.10 an hour			0
during the @entity8 , " wherever and whenever i can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more @entity17 families , that 's what i 'm going to do			0
some warned that the president was embracing an unconstitutional set of tools that would violate the laws of the land			0
" we do n't have a monarchy in this country , " warned rep. @entity28 , @entity29 , " there 's an executive branch and the legislative branch , and the president has to work with @entity3 to get things done			1
" though @entity1 has been far more timid in using executive power than president @entity36 , many in the @entity37 suddenly have a legal problem with presidents going their own way			1
most experts agree that what the president has done is squarely within the prerogatives accorded to presidents			2
there is a long history of presidents using executive power ever since the founding of the nation			2
the power of the office grew enormously over the course of the 20th century and presidents became increasingly comfortable using mechanisms such as signing statements and executive orders to achieve their goals			1
in december 1980 , president @entity59 used an executive order to protect 56 million acres of @entity62 wilderness from mining and logging			2
president @entity65 used executive power to weaken federal agencies that were responsible for policies he opposed			1
president @entity70 used an executive order in 1995 to prevent the federal government from entering into contracts with companies that hired strike - breakers			2
in 2001 , @entity36 enraged many @entity76 when he restricted public access to the papers of former presidents			0
he also overturned many environmental regulations that @entity70 had put into place			0
following the revelation of how many signing statements -- attachments to a bill in which a president can express concerns about sections that he believes to be unconstitutional -- @entity36 had used , rep. @entity90 , @entity91 , explained that what the president was saying is " @entity3 , what you do is n't really important ; i 'm going to do what i want to do			1
" sen. @entity97 , @entity98 , defended @entity36 , stating , " it is precedented and it 's not new			0
" @entity1 has lagged behind most presidents in making full use of his office			1
the average for number of executive orders for presidents since 1900 is 44 per year			1
@entity1 has averaged 37 executive orders -- less than @entity37 presidents @entity109 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity65 and @entity113			1
but just because the president can take executive action , is it a good idea to do so ? there are good reasons that @entity76 should be leery about using presidential power to achieve their ends			1
most important , the executive orders put into place by one president can be easily and quickly overturned by the next president			1
killing policies that are put into place by @entity1 would not be extraordinarily difficult nor would it require the kind of long , protracted struggle that @entity37 have engaged in with @entity131 , thus far unsuccessfully			1
when @entity70 came into office in 1993 , he reversed @entity65 's executive order from 1984 that prohibited the use of federal funds to advocate abortion			2
in 2009 , @entity1 revoked @entity36 's order restricting public access to presidential papers			2
presidential power also deprives a policy of the fierce public debate and congressional vote that comes with legislation			0
although the process of passing bills through @entity3 is usually very painful for a president , if successful a policy obtains a kind of legitimacy that rarely comes from executive action			1
this is evident from how durable the programs from the @entity156 and @entity157 , such as @entity158 , the @entity159 , and @entity160 and @entity161 have been over time			0
through legislative debate , supporters of a bill are forced to present their case and to persuade a sufficient number of representatives and senators to come to their side			0
sometimes a president from one party can persuade some members from the opposition to vote for a bill , permanently putting their imprint on the policy			0
this was a powerful part of why the @entity159 gained such widespread legitimacy throughout the nation			0
even when opponents lose , they are given their chance to say no and to explain to the public why they oppose an idea			0
by contrast , the process of issuing executive orders opens up policies to charges of illegitimacy in a way that are much more difficult to sell with laws passed by @entity3			1
equally important for a president , legislators go must go on record			0
when they do so in support of a bill the legislator becomes much more invested in the coming years in defending that decision			0
opponents go on record as well , and when a policy turns out to be popular and successful this makes them much more hesitant to continue their attacks on a program			0
for decades , @entity37 shied away from the kind of oppositional statements toward @entity160 proposals uttered by @entity210 and @entity65 in the early 1960s for fear that voters would remember how they had stood firm against benefits that turned out to be enormously popular			0
@entity1 certainly would prefer to obtain legislation and the turn to executive power is a decision of last resort , one that realistically might be the only way he can achieve anything else in the next few years			2
but the strategy will come with some significant costs and @entity1 's legacy will remain fragile and vulnerable in the coming years			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

@entity228 : president @entity1 promising to take action even though his agenda *stalled* in @entity3
he says @entity1 is doing what other presidents have done , but there are risks to reliance on executive orders
@entity228 : next president could quickly reverse @entity1 's policies , and lack of congressional support weakens them
