-- a late penalty by @entity2 handed @entity3 a deserved 1 - 0 victory against @entity5 in the opening group d match played in @entity7 on sunday			1
the striker , who plays for @entity10 club @entity9 , emphatically converted from the spot past @entity12 in the 84th minute to the obvious delight of the partisan crowd			0
the victory was the first by an @entity18 team at this year 's @entity19			2
@entity3 were awarded their penalty after @entity5 substitute @entity22 needlessly hand - balled a cross which looked to be drifting harmlessly out of his team 's penalty area			1
amid delirious celebrations of the @entity18 supporters in the @entity28 , @entity5 struggled to find an equalizer and it was @entity3 , the four - time @entity18 champions , who should have made it 2 - 0 before the final whistle			1
who 's creating a @entity35 ? @entity3 -- popularly known as the @entity3 -- started the match at a high tempo and created chances throughout the match , never allowing the @entity5 defense to settle			2
this attacking pattern was set early on when @entity43 midfielder @entity42 volleyed the ball wide after two minutes and @entity3 's captain @entity45 headed a free kick wide of the far post in the 19th minute			0
@entity3 continued to press forward in the second half and came closest to scoring when @entity2 rose high above the @entity5 defense meeting a long throw from @entity50 , only to head the ball just wide of @entity12 's left post			1
@entity5 created fewer chances than their opponents but probably had the better opportunities to score			0
@entity0 's @entity57 blog the giant @entity5 striker @entity58 should have given his country the lead in the 58th minute when he met @entity62 's cross at the far post but his control let him down and the ball dribbled away to safety			0
and later , when @entity5 had been reduced to 10 men after @entity68 received his second yellow card in the 73rd minute , @entity5 squandered a fantastic opportunity to break the deadlock			1
striker , @entity72 broke away from @entity73 's @entity50 on the left goal - line and managed to cut the ball back into the middle of the area which @entity78 then struck fiercely at goalkeeper @entity79 , who parried the ball to safety			0
the resulting corner saw @entity84 's @entity83 narrowly head over the crossbar			0
@entity5 meet @entity86 next friday in @entity87 , while @entity3 play @entity88 in @entity89 on saturday .			2
