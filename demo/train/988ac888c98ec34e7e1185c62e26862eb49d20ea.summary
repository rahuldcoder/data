-- i took care of @entity4 patients from 1981 to 1998 in a county clinic in @entity6			1
by the time they showed up at the door , many of them had advanced disease			0
most died within two years			0
before they died , they suffered from untold painful physical conditions in addition to the unique brand of pain caused by the the pervasive social stigma of @entity4			2
without effective treatment of @entity21 , a physician could n't offer much more than supportive care			1
then , in 1995 , a " cocktail " of three anti-retroviral drugs proved to be successful in fighting the virus -- not completely killing it , but reducing its numbers so its devastation of the immune system was minimized			1
the treatment worked like a miracle			0
patients got better and very quickly			0
seeing the transformation of patients from close to death 's door to living healthy lives was one of the most rewarding experiences i 've had as a physician			2
but the patients are n't cured			2
they must take drugs for their lifetime			0
neither a cure for @entity21 nor a vaccine to prevent @entity21 has yet been developed			2
now , an @entity21 - infected baby who was treated with a combination of drugs from birth to 18 months and then not treated for a year was found to be free of hiv infection at 30 months			1
the child is considered cured			2
this is the second reported @entity21 cure in history and the first in a child , and it is rightly making international news			1
we can all share the joy of a child cured and hope the treatment will bring a better life for infected babies in the future			2
kudos to the clinician , dr. @entity71 , whose expertise , instincts and treatment of the infant led to this remarkable outcome			0
but there was another great advance against the hiv virus that did not make big headlines			0
a simple treatment with anti-retroviral drugs can prevent babies from being infected by their @entity21 positive mothers in the first place			1
of course , a patient cure is much more visible than an infection prevented			0
maybe that is why we celebrate cure in a way that we do not celebrate prevention			0
@entity90 's @entity21 cure offers global hope until the mid- 1990s , pregnant women with hiv infection had a 30 % chance of transmitting the infection to their newborn			1
a landmark study showed that treating @entity21 - positive pregnant women during their labor and delivery with intravenous zidovudine , or @entity102 , and then giving the infant @entity102 syrup orally for four to six weeks reduced the risk of @entity21 transmission to less than 2 %			1
successful prevention means the baby is free of hiv infection and will no longer need treatment			1
we should also celebrate those babies who were not infected with @entity21 by virtue of treatment of mother and newborn with this drug regimen			1
kudos to the thousands of clinicians who have treated @entity21 - infected pregnant mothers and their offspring			1
how do we know the treatment was effective ? we know only by the data meticulously collected by the @entity123 since @entity4 was first recognized in 1981			2
@entity21 transmission from mother to child during pregnancy , labor and delivery or breastfeeding is known as perinatal transmission			1
in 2012 , the @entity132 reported that the combined mother / infant @entity21 treatment regimen resulted in a decline of perinatal transmission by more than 90 % since the beginning of the @entity138			1
@entity4 in the ' 90s : ' i was n't going to die miserably ' this incredible reduction was accomplished despite the fact that more women with hiv infection were giving birth			1
how far we have come			0
women with health care do not have a problem being tested for @entity21			0
the problem lies with women who do n't have health care and have not been tested			0
in 2005 , the @entity132 recommended that if a women arrives in labor in the emergency room and has not had prenatal care , a rapid , 20 - minute test for @entity21 should be done so preventive treatment can be started immediately			2
despite the existence of this treatment , babies are still born infected with @entity21 in the @entity161 and worldwide			2
prevention strategies are rarely perfect			0
that is why we need to have a @entity165 for babies with hiv infection -- and the findings of @entity71 and her colleagues might be just that			1
the potential impact of this discovery will be far greater in developing countries -- especially in @entity174 , where thousands of @entity21 - infected babies are born each year			1
of course , what we desperately need to control @entity21 is a safe and effective vaccine for both infants and adults			0
until then , let us celebrate each success			0
each one gives hope that we will eventually conquer one of the most formidable of viruses			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0

@entity186 one of the first to *investigate* @entity4 , treated patients from 1981 - 1998
she has seen the progress of @entity4 as a death sentence to *people* living with @entity21
@entity186 : baby cured of hiv infection is great news , but infant did n't have to be infected
she says anti-retroviral drugs can easily prevent transmission from mother to child
