@entity0 , @entity1 -- when he lost his second parent to hiv / aids seven years ago , @entity4 's future seemed bleak			1
" i thought maybe @entity7 hated us , " said @entity4 , now 22			2
" we were very scared			2
... but i had to be strong for my brother because he was still young			0
" as orphans in @entity0 , the @entity4 brothers were moved to a home for families and children affected by @entity6			1
there , they were introduced to their first computer through @entity17 , a nonprofit started by @entity18			1
the group connects @entity1 children with caring adults around the world via computer			1
" whatever the cause may be , these children are severely lacking adult attention and guidance , " @entity18 said			1
" kids come into the computer lab because they want this special someone in their lives ... they want to connect with that special someone			2
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity36 using a custom , web - based technology , @entity17 has so far connected almost 300 @entity1 teens -- called @entity40 -- with nearly 200 volunteer mentors from around the world			1
for at least a half - hour each week , pairs meet face to face on what they call the @entity48 - net			0
in @entity51 , " @entity48 means ' everything related to family , ' " said @entity18 , 44			1
" our platform is a virtual world where the mentors and the kids log in in different places , but then can interact and share information in many different ways			0
a relationship starts between one person here and one person there , and then that relationship expands			0
" in addition to basic web - cam capabilities , the @entity48 - net offers about a dozen interactive forums , including a live chat function , a virtual " wipeboard " where pairs can play games , and areas where pairs can do homework and surf the @entity73 together			0
there is also an alert sos button that @entity40 can use if they are in dire need of guidance between scheduled chats			0
the experience has benefited @entity4 , who is starting his first job as an it professional on the @entity85 , @entity1 's first inner - city high - speed rail			1
when he was younger , " he was one of those kids that was sitting in the back of the classroom and was really , really struggling , " @entity18 said			1
" about six months after being connected with @entity92 ( @entity93 of @entity94 , @entity95 , ) he came up to me when i came to visit and said , ' @entity18 , @entity18 , i 'm in the head of the class now , and i am so happy with where my life is going			2
' " @entity4 is also pursuing a degree in @entity84 , and he credits @entity17 for getting his life on the right track			0
" my net family , @entity105 , she always advise me with the future plans : how to set my goals , how to achieve them , " @entity4 said			0
" i thought maybe this is my chance again to have a family			0
... they 've been there for me ... just like my parents			2
" @entity18 , a resident of @entity113 , @entity114 , understands the important role a caring adult can play on a child 's own concept of the future			1
raised with two adopted siblings , she knew from an early age that she wanted to become an adoptive parent one day			0
she did so in 2003 , when she and her husband , @entity123 , visited @entity1 to adopt their son @entity124 , now 7			2
while in @entity1 , @entity18 witnessed how @entity6 has resulted in millions of children being left without parents			1
according to the @entity130 , nearly 15 million children in @entity129 have been orphaned by @entity6			1
" if none of the adults you care about has ever lived past 35 , then why would you think you can ? why would you stay in school ; why would you learn skills ? " @entity18 said			1
" [ with ] so many children and so few adults to help them grow up , i knew we had to find a way to bring new information , resources and the caring , nurturing effect of other adults into the lives of [ these ] children			1
" since 2006 , @entity17 has built and operated five computer labs at partner organization sites across @entity1			1
in addition to providing mentors for children , the computer - driven communication of the @entity48 - net also develops their language and technology skills , preparing them to compete in the global marketplace			2
" if the relationship is the motivation for attracting a child to a caring adult , then it 's also the inspiration for getting that child to invest in themselves , to learn the skills to do whatever they need in the future , " @entity18 said			1
before being paired with a child , mentors are subject to background checks , technological tutorials and cultural seminars covering mourning , @entity6 and developing relationships through e-mail			2
they sign up for a minimum of one year , but most continue beyond the requirement			0
mentors can meet with their net buddies from wherever they have a secure internet connection			0
gifts , further financial assistance and any other help is optional and given to partner organizations directly -- never between mentor and mentee			0
" the mentors know that all they have to offer is themselves , " @entity18 said			2
" we like to say , ' the gift is you			0
' ... it 's a bite - sized opportunity to change a world			0
and there 's no commute			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity17 website at www.infinitefamily.org and see how to help .			0
