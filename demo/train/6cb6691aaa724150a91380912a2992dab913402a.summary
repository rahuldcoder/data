@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's been more than 180 years since @entity1 saw @entity5 's face			1
but the revolutionary leader 's thick sideburns , bushy eyebrows and steely gaze popped out from behind picture frames tuesday in new @entity12 images unveiled by president @entity13			1
researchers used several software programs to reconstruct the face of the man who liberated @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity1 from the @entity24 crown			1
scans of @entity5 's skeletal remains , which investigators exhumed two years ago , factored into their calculations			1
so did historical paintings , photos of restored uniforms @entity5 wore and images of middle - aged @entity1 , officials said			2
" @entity5 is and will be one of the greatest giants of humanity , of the cause and the human struggle , one of the best of the human species , " @entity13 said as he unveiled the portraits , according to state - run @entity35			1
while computer modeling software played a key role in the reconstruction , @entity45 's @entity44 laboratory also manually added in details -- like estimations of the former leader 's skin color , tissue thickness and bone density , according to a @entity1 government statement			2
an investigation into what caused @entity5 's death continues , the @entity1 government said			1
most historical accounts say tuberculosis killed @entity5 , who died in 1830 at the age of 47			0
but @entity13 , who often mentions @entity5 in speeches and describes him as a personal hero , ordered investigators to exhume the body of the former military leader and determine whether he was murdered			2
a report released this month said the investigation had been inconclusive			0
the new portraits come two years after state television showed @entity5 's skeletal remains in a dramatic ceremony			1
with the national anthem playing in the background , a group of scientists wearing white coats rolled up a black cloth , revealing a skeleton on the table below			0
the broadcast then faded to black , showing @entity13 singing along to the national anthem			0
let us not see him as a dead man and let us not see him as a skeleton			0
he is like lightning , like a sacred fire , " @entity13 said after the exhumation in 2010			0
tuesday was the 229th anniversary of @entity5 's birth			2
@entity13 has credited @entity5 with inspiring him as " the father of the revolution			0

he is credited with spreading democratic principles in @entity101			0
a new $ 116 million mausoleum to house @entity5 's remains is under construction in @entity0 , @entity1 's government said in a statement tuesday			1
