a proposed new route through @entity1 for the controversial @entity3 will require six to nine months of review under the normal process conducted by state and federal officials , a @entity1 official said thursday			1
@entity8 , director of the @entity9 of @entity10 , told @entity11 that the proposal from @entity13 will undergo a public comment period followed by final revisions by the company before his agency does its full assessment			2
noting the delay in the project over the route alteration , @entity8 said : " we 're still saying six to nine months			2
" @entity13 , the company proposing the pipeline from @entity25 's oil sands production in northern @entity26 to the @entity28 @entity27 , is seeking approval for a new route east of the initially proposed route , which went over an environmentally sensitive aquifer			1
a @entity35 official told @entity11 on thursday that the @entity37 administration has not received a new permit application for the proposed alternate route for the northern portion of the pipeline			1
when the department receives an application , the next step would be to coordinate with @entity1 and other states along the route as they assess the proposal , the official said on background			1
@entity8 , a @entity50 who is a political appointee , said it is up to @entity13 to submit a permit application to the @entity35			1
the 1,700 - mile pipeline , intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day , has become a political lightning rod in the @entity28			1
last year , the @entity37 administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until 2013 , citing concerns raised by @entity1 officials and environmental groups about the original route near the vital @entity64 , which provides drinking water for much of @entity1 and is important for the state 's agricultural economy			1
environmentalists fear a burst in the pipeline would allow oil to seep into the massive water table			2
republicans accused president @entity37 of putting off the issue until after the november election to avoid angering his environmental allies			1
they forced the addition of a provision to speed up approval of the project in the december debt ceiling agreement despite warnings by @entity37 that the 60 - day timeline for a decision would guarantee rejection			2
in february , the @entity35 -- which has authority over international pipeline projects -- rejected the proposal on grounds that there was no alternative route to examine			0
@entity13 said then it would submit a new proposal for the route through @entity1			1
supporters , including the oil industry , say the pipeline would create jobs and reduce the country 's dependence on oil imported from volatile regions			0
" the stars are aligning for @entity28 's energy future and president @entity37 should make the right choice now and approve the entire @entity3 , " said @entity102 , president and ceo of the @entity104 , the main oil industry organization			1
" the president 's concerns about the sensitive @entity112 area of @entity1 have been addressed			2
there are no more excuses			0
mr. president , let 's get this energy and job - creating project started now			0
" opponents , including environmentalists , say that the pipeline might leak and that it would lock the @entity28 into a particularly dirty form of crude oil that might ultimately end up being exported anyway			0
under the timeline provided by @entity8 , hearings for public comment will be held and @entity13 will then consider that feedback to determine the specifics of the proposed alternate route			1
" we will have a significant amount of time for public comment , " @entity8 said			0
" ... they 'll refine the route they really want to focus on as a preferred route and then do a more in - depth analysis on the ground of the actual route			0
" once @entity13 submits that final proposal to his department , it should take 30 to 60 days for the review to be completed and a draft supplemental impact statement prepared , he said			1
regarding the @entity35 's role , @entity8 said the situation is unique because under normal circumstances , @entity13 would have an application pending			0
however , the initial application was rejected , so the company must file a new one			0
@entity50 leaders are pressuring @entity37 and @entity155 to speed approval of the pipeline			1
" with this new route submitted and the state of @entity1 acting to move forward , the president is running out of excuses for blocking the @entity3 pipeline any longer , " house speaker @entity158 , @entity159 , told @entity11 on wednesday , noting that a " veto - proof majority " in the @entity162 supports the project			1
the @entity162 on wednesday approved a @entity50 bill that aims to fast - track the @entity3 project as part of another 90 - day extension of federal transportation funding			2
the 293 - 127 vote allows @entity158 to begin negotiations with @entity155 over a longer - term funding measure for road , rail and bridge projects			0
@entity37 announced in march that he would approve the southern portion of the pipeline , which runs from @entity181 , @entity182 -- a key repository of @entity28 oil -- to the @entity27			2
he had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion , even when he blocked the full project			0
currently , there are not enough pipelines to take the oil being produced in @entity25 and @entity191 to refineries and terminals on the @entity27			0
that means @entity196 refineries can pay lower prices to get it			0
giving the @entity25 oil easier access to the @entity27 means the glut in the @entity196 goes away , making it more expensive for the region , but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets .			0
