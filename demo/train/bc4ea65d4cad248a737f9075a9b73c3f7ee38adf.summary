@entity0 -- full - body imaging machines that see through clothes have significantly improved security in airports where they are deployed , and have revealed more than 60 " artfully concealed " illegal or prohibited items in the past year , the @entity2 says			1
to date , no explosives have been detected by the machines , but their ability to spot even small concealed objects demonstrates their effectiveness as a security tool , officials said			1
" it is absolutely a tremendous improvement of what we can detect at the checkpoints , " @entity2 acting administrator @entity16 said this week			1
" it is an excellent piece of technology that will significantly improve our detection capabilities			2
" as evidence of the machines ' capabilities , the security agency released five photos of drugs or suspected drugs that airport screeners found after scans revealed anomalies on the ghost - like images of people 's bodies			1
the agency said metal detectors would not have revealed the items			2
screeners using the technology also found a knife hidden in the small of a person 's back at the @entity50 , @entity49 , airport , a concealed razor blade on a passenger in @entity53 , @entity54 , and other concealed items such as large bottles of lotion , which are prohibited as carry - on items			1
in addition , the machines have revealed numerous prohibited items that passengers evidently inadvertently left in pockets			1
those items are confiscated but are not counted in the tally , a @entity2 spokesman said			1
@entity67 to implement new airport security measures the agency field - tested the full - body imagers for more than a year before announcing last month the deployment of machines to 11 airports nationwide			1
today , 46 machines are in place in 23 airports , and the agency is stepping up deployments and plans to have about 1,000 set up by the end of 2011			2
interest in the machines has heightened since the @entity82 incident in which a man allegedly attempted to detonate an explosive concealed in his underwear			1
in an appearance before @entity87 last month , @entity16 declined to say whether the machines could have detected the underwear bomb			1
but to illustrate the machines ' effectiveness , @entity16 showed a packet of white powder smaller than a tea bag , saying it was identical to a concealed bag detected by an imager			1
" the amazing thing is that our officers , as they get more and more familiar with this technology , are actually finding very , very small things that are being secreted on the body , " she said			2
but some passengers say the machine 's capabilities are presenting new @entity108 questions about the government 's searches , saying the machines -- in detecting very small objects -- are subjecting passengers to scrutiny beyond what is needed to safeguard the plane			2
" i ca n't imaging an explosive that is powerful enough in that [ tea - bag size ] quantity to endanger an aircraft , " said @entity117 , a former @entity118 lyricist who once took the @entity2 to court after a search of his checked luggage revealed a small amount of drugs			1
" every time technology makes another leap forward , we have to reclaim the @entity108 , and often we have to reclaim the entire @entity130 , because technology gives us powers that were not envisioned by the @entity133 , " @entity117 said			0
the security agency said that it searches only for prohibited items -- not illegal items such as drugs			1
when it finds illegal items during a search , it refers the item to local law enforcement officers , it says			2
" what we 're trying to resolve is the anomaly that we 're seeing on the body , " said @entity16			0
" if it 's drugs , then we call in local law enforcement and they handle it from there			2
" @entity117 predicted that the body scanner will lead to another court case to clarify the extent it can be used to search the body			0
" eventually they 're going to bust somebody for something that was clearly and obviously not a threat to the aircraft , and any reasonable person would have known that [ while looking at the ] body scan			0
and at that point somebody is going to make it an issue , " he said			0
@entity16 said the body imagers are especially useful because they can expose contraband on parts of the body that are n't fully explored in pat - downs , such as the groin			0
" i think what was so telling about the @entity82 attack was that it exploited our cultural norms , that we do n't frequently pat down persons in that part of the body			0
this technology will give us the image of the entire body , " she said			0
but @entity16 said the imagers are not a " silver bullet " because " those who intend to do harm are constantly adapting			0
" " we still have to have multiple layers of security , " she said			0
for all his reservations about scanners , @entity117 said he does not hesitate going through one			0
" i 've got nothing to hide , " he said			0
" i go through the scanner			0
if anybody wants to see me naked , they 're welcome to the sight			0
