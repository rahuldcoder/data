-- what he lacks in technique , @entity1 makes up for in geeks			1
@entity5 co-founder @entity1 and his partner show off their moves on " @entity8			1
" the @entity5 co-founder has managed to transform his less - than - graceful moves on @entity11 's " @entity8 " into enough votes to keep hope alive on the competitive ballroom - dance show			1
" @entity1 , " as he is known by friends and fans alike , and partner @entity22 have had some of the lowest scores from the trio of judges since the show premiered on march 9			1
but the judges , who are experts in the field of competitive dance , are n't the only deciding factor			2
viewers can vote online , via phone calls or by text messaging , and those votes comprise 50 percent of each couple 's score			0
the dance team with the lowest combined score is then voted off the show -- a fate that may await @entity1 on tuesday night			2
@entity1 and @entity22 are up against a bevy of entertainers , including an @entity39 , an @entity40 , the most successful female rapper in hip - hop history and an actor whose claim to fame is appearing naked in the film " @entity47			1
" but all that star power has so far been matched by the power of computer geeks who are using what they know best to keep the rhythmically challenged @entity53 icon in the game			0
@entity55 , technology director for the @entity57 , @entity58 - based advertising , public relations and new media firm @entity61 , set up @entity62 and a similarly named @entity64 account , which so far has more than 55,000 followers			0
@entity55 -- who began rallying the techie troops almost as soon as @entity11 announced that @entity1 would be competing -- said he is rooting for the philanthropist because " he puts more heart and more passion in what he 's doing than some of the other dancers			1
" " when you have beautiful athletes , movie stars and tv personalities , and then you mix in a geek , there 's something a little strange and entertaining , " @entity55 said			0
" being a fellow geek myself , i thought now is the time to work with the technologies that we know and start pushing for the vote			0
" that means lots and lots of social networking to spread the love -- and the word of @entity1			1
@entity92 is a longtime friend of @entity1 's and one of the officers for the official " vote for @entity1 on @entity11 's ' @entity8 ' " @entity97 group			1
@entity92 shares his friend 's passion for philanthropy and runs his own foundation and the site joesworld.org			1
he also knows a bit about reality television			0
a former cast member of @entity107 's " @entity106 : @entity112 , " @entity92 was instrumental in convincing his bud to sign on to the show and said the lovable ( though some might argue lumbering ) @entity1 has garnered fans both young and old			1
" he loves his fans , and he 's completely flattered by the fan response , " @entity92 said			0
" he 's a shy guy , and he 's doing a crazy , unique and different thing in his life that he wants to share with the world			1
" @entity92 , who is also executive producer of the documentary " @entity119 : the admirable lunacy of @entity122 , " said he enjoys watching his friend dance each week			0
" he 's the most uniquely giving , loving , happy man , " @entity92 said			0
" with so many people watching this show , it 's a good , infectious way to spread love , joy and hope			0
" @entity131 of @entity132 , @entity133 , is one viewer who has fully embraced the @entity1 mania			2
he won an autographed copy of the book " @entity137 " for submitting a video of himself imitating @entity1 's dance moves to @entity62			1
@entity131 said it 's only natural that fans of @entity1 would turn to the @entity143 to support him			2
" without [ @entity1 ] there probably would n't be a @entity145 , @entity64 or @entity97 , " @entity131 said			2
" he 's the reason why we even have a computer			0
i like seeing him on the show			0
" unfortunately , the " @entity8 " judges do n't seem to feel the same way			1
despite dancing through injuries -- including a pulled hamstring that sent him to the hospital in an ambulance last week -- @entity1 failed to impress the experts monday night			1
while he did manage to score a perfect 10 , it was a collective 10 out of a possible 30			0
at one point during @entity1 's and @entity22 's samba , judge @entity158 put his face in his hands			2
@entity1 capped their routine by doing his version of the break - dance move known as " the worm , " but even that failed to save his lackluster performance			2
" at some point the novelty wears off , " said judge @entity170 , often cited as the kindest of the three			0
@entity1 , who beat out former @entity176 's lead singer @entity175 after a dance - off in an earlier round , kept his smile throughout the storm of criticism			1
" i enjoy it , " he said on the show afterward			0
" i 'm going to try to bring my form of entertainment to the world			0

fellow " geeks " are supporting @entity1 via voting and social - networking sites
