it has been 35 years since a group of @entity3 students stormed the @entity4 in @entity5 and took a group of @entity8 hostage			1
you have seen this story play out in movies like " @entity12 " and shows like " homeland , " but here are six things about the @entity3 hostage crisis that you may not have known			2
1 ) this conflict is often described as the @entity8 ' first brush with political @entity20			1
in 1979 , the @entity21 installed an anti-western @entity20 theocracy , which replaced the @entity24 monarchy of the @entity25			0
the @entity8 was referred to as " the @entity26 " by the new @entity3 government , and @entity3 looked at the @entity8 with suspicion because of its role in keeping the @entity25 in power			1
@entity3 felt the @entity8 meddled too much in @entity3 's internal affairs , and were afraid the @entity31 was plotting to return the @entity25 to power			1
the @entity21 himself blessed the hostage - taking at the embassy , further fueling the government 's hard line against the @entity8			1
2 ) the @entity4 in @entity5 warned @entity38 the embassy would be attacked			1
by october 1979 , the @entity25 had fled @entity3 and was staying in @entity39			0
there , doctors discovered the @entity25 was suffering from an aggressive cancer and recommended he be admitted to a hospital in the @entity8			0
the situation in @entity5 was already tense , and the head of the diplomatic mission at the @entity4 in @entity5 sent several cables to @entity38 , saying that if the @entity25 was allowed to come to the @entity8 for treatment , the embassy would be taken			1
president @entity50 allowed the @entity25 into the @entity8 , with much hesitation , and the @entity3 were outraged			1
they saw this as an excuse to bring the @entity25 to the @entity8 to plot his return to power			0
this was just weeks before the embassy was attacked			0
3 ) some of the hostages were beaten and tortured , and even underwent a mock execution			1
@entity3 has maintained a narrative that the hostages were treated well , but that is not true			2
not all the hostages were treated the same			0
the two women , @entity64 and @entity65 , said they were treated " correctly " by their captors , but others , including @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , were subject to a mock execution , where they were awakened in the middle of the night , forced to strip to their underwear and marched to a room in the basement where their guards made it seem they were about to be executed by firing squad			1
the guards fired their weapons , but they were not loaded			0
why did they do it ? @entity69 said it was because " they thought it would be fun			0
" 4 ) the hostages were released only after president @entity87 was sworn in			1
@entity88 described this as the @entity3 ' last act of cruelty toward president @entity50			2
even though the @entity8 and @entity3 had come to an agreement to free the hostages in december , the @entity3 waited literally until the hour president @entity87 was sworn in before allowing the plane with the hostages to take off			1
the @entity3 had a deep hatred of @entity50 and wanted to deny him this last moment of victory as president			2
5 ) after the hostages were released , they met with president @entity50			0
@entity99 , who was held in solitary confinement for almost the entire time he was a hostage , said , " it was not a warm welcome " when @entity50 flew to the @entity8 military base in @entity106 to meet the hostages right after their release			2
the hostages were split on their thinking			0
many felt they were left unprotected in the embassy after @entity50 made the decision to allow the @entity25 into the @entity8			2
@entity99 said that during the meeting , @entity50 went around to hug all the hostages , and many remained still with their arms at their sides and did not return his hug			0
6 ) the former @entity4 in @entity5 has been preserved as a museum			2
the embassy in @entity5 is now an @entity20 cultural center and a museum , preserved from the days when it was a prison in 1979			1
it stands as a symbol of the @entity3 revolution , and is known in @entity3 as the " den of spies			0
" old typewriters , communication equipment , even old visa photos , are on display			0
every year on the anniversary of the hostage taking , @entity3 hold rallies where " @entity136 " is chanted , just as it was in 1979 .			0

the siege of the @entity4 in @entity3 was 35 years *ago*
some @entity8 hostages were subject to a mock execution
@entity3 waited for president @entity87 's *inauguration* before releasing the hostages
the embassy in @entity5 is now an @entity20 cultural center
