@entity0 might be on track to issue another apology			1
after her career in food imploded last year when she admitted to previously using a racial slur , the 67 - year - old celebrity chef is trying to slowly rebuild what she 's lost			2
however , her recent cover story with @entity9 is having the opposite effect			1
in the article , @entity0 says she is finding inspiration in what might seem an unusual place given her past troubles			1
" i feel like ' embattled ' or ' disgraced ' will always follow my name , " she tells people			1
" it 's like that black football player who recently came out , " referring to @entity21 prospect and former @entity23 football standout , @entity22			0
" he ( @entity22 ) said , ' i just want to be known as a football player			0
i do n't want to be known as a gay football player			0
' i know exactly what he 's saying			0
" given that the former doyenne of @entity32 cuisine has acknowledged in a deposition that she 'd used the " n " word in the past , several observers were thrown by her choice of words			2
" seriously @entity0 ? " twitter user @ @entity39 responded to @entity41 's story on @entity0 's people interview , summing up in two words the reaction of the @entity45			1
" @entity0 crashing and burning before she rises from the ashes like a @entity48 , " commented @ @entity46			2
the @entity51 's @entity50 channel , meanwhile , tried for some humor : " @entity0 comes back from her racist past as a @entity54			1
" " i honestly do n't have a problem with @entity0 i just need her to stop speaking about anything other than cooking , " said @ mktggirl			2
her comment is a noticeable misstep in what 's been pegged as her " comeback " plan : within the past month , @entity0 has made a warmly welcomed appearance at the recent @entity65 festival , has announced a new company , @entity66 , and confirmed she 's planning to open a new restaurant in @entity68 , @entity69			1
it 's the support from her fans , @entity0 tells @entity72 , that 's enabled her to get back up after last summer 's controversy stripped her of sponsors and her gig as a @entity78 personality			1
" if it was n't for my fans ' love , i 'd be home breathing into a paper bag , " @entity0 says			0
" when i woke up each morning , it was like my world was crashing down again			0
... i 'm fighting to get my name back			0
" it looks like that fight continues .			0
