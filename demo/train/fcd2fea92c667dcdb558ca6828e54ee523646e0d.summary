-- in the end , it was always @entity3			0
that was the big bombshell from monday night 's final episode of " @entity6 , " which piled on one surprise after another			1
when @entity11 finally finished the story for his kids , they called him on it : his story was n't all about how he met their mother ( she was barely in the story ) , it was about how much he loved @entity3			1
as many had theorized , the mother of @entity11 's children ( whose name was @entity22 , by the way ) , had been dead for years by the time he told his story			1
so , in the last of many flash - forwards in this finale , @entity11 went to the street in front of @entity3 's apartment and showed up with that blue @entity31 horn , the same one he stole for her in the first episode			1
@entity3 , of course , had long ago divorced @entity35 -- the first big shocker of the night			0
@entity35 , however , we would learn , became a father , and in one of several touching scenes from the episode , finally found the love of his life in baby @entity44			1
@entity45 and @entity46 , pregnant with their second child in the present day , went on to have a third , but @entity46 was heartbroken when @entity3 decided she could n't be as much a part of their gang anymore , due in part to @entity35 continuing to be , well , @entity35 around her			0
and what about the mother , aka @entity55 ? we finally did see that moment of the two meeting at that train station , and it was played perfectly by @entity59 and the @entity61 - worthy @entity60			2
they would n't get married for several years , having postponed their wedding when @entity55 got pregnant with their first child			0
@entity11 shared with his kids that he learned he had to love their mother with everything he had in him , through good times and bad , especially during her illness			1
needless to say , the show stayed true to form , as it had in all its nine years , wearing its heart on its sleeve			0
and if your eyes stayed dry through the entire episode , you 're probably a stronger person than most viewers			2
of course , the big @entity3 twist did n't exactly sit well with everyone online ( people such as @entity85 @ @entity86 , who tweeted , " it took me so long to get over the fact @entity11 and @entity3 were n't going to end up together and now this ? ! @entity83 " ) , and the finale seems to have split viewers more than any since " lost			2
" other viewers were more forgiving			0
" # @entity6 creators stayed true to the story , " tweeted fan @entity91			2
" finale fit the show , even if it is not what i wanted			0
ca n't stop thinking about it			0
" what do you think ? do you wish @entity55 had stayed alive and @entity11 did n't ultimately end up with @entity3 ? or do you think it was a fitting ending ? for that matter , what do you think about @entity35 and @entity3 splitting up ? let us know in the comments and give yourself a self - five for making it all the way through nine seasons .			1

" @entity6 " ends after nine seasons
viewers finally learn about @entity11 's truly love
some fans appeared angered by the ending
