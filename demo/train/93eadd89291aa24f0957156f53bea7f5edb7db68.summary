@entity0 -- when senate majority leader @entity3 , @entity4 , pronounced this week that " 17 angry old white men will wake up and realize they 've just bought the country , " after the elections , he echoed the distaste many @entity9 feel at the secrecy surrounding the flood of money pouring into campaigns			2
political experts estimate $ 6 billion will be spent during the 2012 presidential elections — a large chunk of it via anonymous donors thanks to a @entity20 ruling which allows unlimited corporate campaign donations			1
that 's enough money to give 6/7ths of the world 's population $ 1 each			2
politicos and even comedians have made much ado about the influence of anonymous super rich donors and well heeled super pacs , groups that can raise money from a number of sources and spend unlimited amounts independent of and in support of political campaigns			1
@entity39 on @entity40 bemoaned failed efforts this week at forcing out of the shadows political campaign donors who give more than $ 10,000 to independent groups			1
republicans called @entity39 efforts a disingenuous attempt to silence critics by going " after the microphone instead , by trying to scare off the funders , " said @entity53 minority leader @entity52 , @entity54 , long an advocate of campaign donations as a form of free speech			1
@entity53 @entity46 block @entity59 for second straight day " we are determined to prove that transparency is not a radical concept , " sen. @entity60 , @entity61 , said of the bill to force groups to reveal big donors ' identities			1
" our bill is as simple and straightforward as it gets -- if you are making large donations to influence an election , the voters in that election should know who you are			1
the @entity9 people are blessed with common sense			0
they know that when someone will not admit to something , it is usually because there is something to hide			0
" it 's an issue that 's chock - ful of sermonizing and spin			0
" every election we have a lot of hand - wringing ... but this issue has been with us a long time , " said @entity85 , a former @entity86 chairman and a veteran campaign finance attorney			2
the fact is the @entity20 has found that this practice qualifies as free speech			1
the fact is lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have punted -- repeatedly -- on forcing big donors to disclose their identities			1
lawmakers such as @entity103 once supported transparency for these types of donations but later vociferously advocated anonymity to protect donors from harassment			2
the fact is both major political parties and conservative and liberal groups alike have benefited for decades from money donated from the shadows			0
" yes , there are some pretty rich people who support super pacs because they have some strong ideas			0
the super pacs are not the evil so many people portray them to be , " said @entity119 , a @entity120 professor who worked on @entity121 , the landmark 1970s @entity20 case that determined spending money to influence elections is a form of free speech			1
pro-obama super pac raises $ 6.1 million in june " just because some people can speak more than other people , the solution is not to prevent them to speaking , " @entity119 said			2
" it 's to help ... level up free speech for everybody			1
" still , something about it , for many folks , just feels , well , wrong			0
a poll conducted in april of roughly 1,000 likely voters by the the @entity144 at @entity145 found that " one in four @entity9 — 26 % — say they are less likely to vote because big donors to super pacs have so much more influence over elected officials than average @entity9			1
" pro-romney super pac brings in $ 20 million in june for some voters , big dollars means big trouble for the electoral process			2
" of course that kind of money spells trouble ! if nothing else , it leaves the suspicion that the office is for sale to the highest bidder , " @entity157 said on @entity158			0
" campaign spending should be limited to whatever the office will pay for that term			0
" others feel the bluster over anonymous donors is a red herring			1
president @entity174 and @entity46 presidential candidate @entity175 " will each spend a lot on advertising as is usually done			0
this election is much more important to conservatives so they are making a lot of contributions to @entity175 , " @entity176 said on @entity158			0
" @entity174 has gone to a lot of fundraisers so he has a lot of money too			0
that 's the way is it and those who do n't like it do n't have to like it			0
" why @entity39 need labor unions			0

roughly $ 6 billion will be spent on presidential election -- much through anonymous donors
the @entity20 has ruled that this practice qualifies as free speech
lawmakers ca n't agree on requiring big donors to disclose their identities
some say they *'re* less likely to vote because big donors have so much influence
