-- it 's hard to imagine @entity2 having second thoughts about tackling any role , but the actress admits that she had doubts about " @entity7 , " her newest project			1
the cast of " @entity7 , " from left : @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity2 and @entity13			1
the film -- based on a @entity15 - and @entity17 - winning play by the same name -- examines what happens when a strict nun who heads a catholic school in the @entity22 suspects a charismatic priest of having an inappropriate relationship with a student			1
" i actually did n't think it would ever be a movie , " @entity2 said			1
" it was so thoroughly realized on stage , and it was so minimal			0
it was hard to imagine how or why you would make a movie out of it			0
" but @entity2 , who plays the terrifyingly severe and determined school principal , sister @entity34 , said she changed her mind when she saw the final product			1
" how did they make the play without any children in it ? it is just sort of amazing to me , because to me they are sort of the landscape			2
they are the lambs of the movie			0
they are why everybody is passionate			0
" her co-stars are passionate about sharing the screen with a @entity54 legend			0
@entity13 , who plays the priest targeted by @entity2 's character in the film , says he " adores " her			1
@entity12 calls @entity2 " a sweetheart			1
" @entity11 says she 's " just fantastic			1
" @entity60 ' performance in the movie is generating @entity63 buzz , with @entity2 advising the actress to pick out a dress for the @entity63			1
@entity60 , who plays the mother of the student at the center of the sexual abuse allegations at the school , said she drew on the experiences of her mom and other women she knows to bring the role to life			2
she expressed awe about any suggestion of an @entity63 nomination			1
i do n't know how to respond to that anymore , " @entity60 said			0
" all i wanted to do was good work			0
... everything else is just the icing on the cake			0
" the movie is set in 1964 , but the play was written by @entity87 after the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the @entity89 several years ago			2
@entity13 -- who plays @entity90 , the priest under fire -- said the lurid headlines about molested children were n't even on his mind when he took on the project			1
" it is really about something else			0
if people see it , they will know what i mean about that , " @entity13 said			1
some have suggested that the play served as a criticism of the @entity108 administration 's dogged belief that there were weapons of mass destruction in @entity111			2
@entity87 , who won an @entity63 for his screenplay of " @entity113 , " told @entity114 that the play did have a political point			1
" i 'm not interested in morality , " he told the magazine			0
" one of my larger premises in doing this play , in what 's not said , is that doubt itself is a passionate exercise			2
i think it 's perceived in this culture as something weak or denatured , and that 's a huge mistake			0
" @entity130 said she became " a little obsessed " with the adaptation of the play to the big screen			2
she plays @entity136 , a nun who expresses her suspicions about @entity90 's relationship with the student to @entity34			1
the movie is a departure for @entity130 , who became famous for sunnier roles in films like " enchanted " and " @entity145			0
" but she said she does n't mind being known as an eternally cheerful actress , because that description reflects " 75 percent " of her real persona			0
" there 's 25 percent that 's probably dark and grumpy and not personable at all , but i keep her at home , " @entity130 said			0
as for @entity63 buzz surrounding her performance , the actress said she 's keeping her fingers crossed for @entity2 and @entity60 to be nominated for their roles in " @entity7 " but has no expectations for herself			1
" it 's always fun , and i would love to			0
if it does n't happen for me , it 's all right as well , " @entity130 said			0
" so , the experience of making the film was my get in this case			2
