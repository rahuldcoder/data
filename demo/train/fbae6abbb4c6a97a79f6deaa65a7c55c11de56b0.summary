" no , seriously -- i wo n't go on with the show unless y'all stand up			0
" as video from the concert shows , @entity1 really was n't kidding , as he took several moments to scan the audience for anyone sitting down			1
when he spotted two people who still were n't standing , @entity1 initially griped , " this was the longest i 've had to wait to do a song			2
" according to @entity37 , one of those individuals had a prosthetic limb , and another was in a wheelchair			0
after sending someone over to investigate why the two concertgoers were n't standing , @entity1 quickly clarified that " if you 're using a wheelchair , then it 's fine			2
... only if he 's in a wheelchair			0
" once he 'd confirmed that those not standing really could n't , @entity1 continued with his show			1
the stunt was met with an immediate backlash on @entity50			0
according to the @entity52 , it was n't the first time @entity1 has been criticized for making that kind of demand			1
