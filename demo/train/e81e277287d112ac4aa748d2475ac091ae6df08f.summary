-- @entity2 's return to tv with @entity5 's " the @entity4 " is an exciting and inspiring move -- there 's no argument there			1
but will his decision help boost @entity5 's comedy slate to its once - untouchable highs ? that 's a question with a less straightforward answer			1
after leaving tv over a decade ago to manage his escalating parkinson 's disease , the 52 - year - old industry icon has signed up for his first weekly starring role since " @entity20			2
" instead of trying to work around @entity22 's , he 's chosen to work with it : the premise of @entity5 's new " @entity4 " has the actor portraying a @entity27 news personality named @entity28 , who also left tv due to @entity22 's , but has made a recent return , much to his family 's relief			1
@entity2 's triumphant return to tv executive produced by @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , " the @entity2 " show was easily one of the most anticipated debuts of the 2013 fall tv season			1
and yet , says the @entity42 , " it does n't take long to realize that something is off in ' the @entity4			1
' " the critic , @entity45 , found " very little " in the show 's pilot episode that " will force you to laugh			0
... the show is more concerned with making ( @entity36 's character ) a saint than it is with making him funny			1
" the @entity52 said the show yields " mixed results , " and not only because the humor -- which includes jokes about @entity22 's -- is uneven			0
" the pilot is asking you to , in a sense , laugh at @entity22 's jokes and the man suffering from its effects			0
the unspoken agreement is that if it 's fine with @entity36 , then it should be fine with you			2
but that does n't make it any less uncomfortable , " @entity65 said			0
" it 's clear that tone and direction on ' the @entity4 ' have n't been completely worked out yet			2
what is n't clear is what the audience reaction will be -- especially when patience needs to be the primary one			0
" if you disagree with that assessment of the pilot 's comedy , @entity76 's @entity75 is right there with you			0
the " ways in which the comedy uses his experience , irreverently but not snarkily , is by far the most remarkable part of the show , " @entity75 said			0
" the problem with ' the @entity4 ' is how unremarkable everything else in it is			2
" given how strong @entity36 is as an actor , fans should n't lose hope with the series as it finds its voice			1
" the @entity4 " does use the same documentary - style approach that shows like " @entity97 " have used to success , which means many critics felt it was trying too hard to be like @entity101 's critically acclaimed " @entity100			1
" with patience , though , " the @entity4 " may be able to stand out in its own right			2
" the best part about ' the @entity4 ' is @entity2 , who is still as sharp , sarcastic and on - point as ever , " critiques @entity105			1
" that 's what makes this show so likable , even though the jokes about his @entity22 's might make some viewers uneasy			0
... ( @entity113 ) f the show can figure out where that fits in , it 's golden			0
it 's striving to be ' @entity100 , ' when it should be working on highlighting its strengths			0

@entity2 returned to tv on *thursday* *night*
he stars in the new @entity5 comedy " the @entity4 "
critics had mixed feelings about the first few episodes
@entity36 is still great , but the series itself needs some work
