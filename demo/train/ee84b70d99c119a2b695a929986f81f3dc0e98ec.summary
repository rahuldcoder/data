trust me , the scandal - scarred former boy wonder said			0
no way , responded @entity5 's highest court			0
the state @entity7 rejected former journalist @entity9 ' request for admission to the bar on monday , finding that he had not truly reformed in the 15 years since he made up facts in more than 40 magazine articles -- and then lied some more to cover up his misdeeds in one of the journalism world 's most infamous scandals			1
the court found that @entity9 , who works as a paralegal at a @entity21 law firm , lacks " the good moral character " to be a lawyer			1
it simply does n't buy the disgraced serial liar 's arguments that he has changed			0
in a scathing 33 - page opinion supporting its decision to deny @entity9 admission to the @entity31 , the court concluded that he failed to show genuine remorse and never fully came clean on all his fabrications and that his " lack of integrity and forthrightness " continued even during his hearings before the court			1
lawyers and journalists are n't highly regarded , although they usually rank a notch above lobbyists , members of @entity48 and used - car salespeople in @entity46 's annual @entity45 survey			0
lawyer jokes to the contrary , the court insisted , " a lawyer 's good moral character is essential for the protection of clients and for the proper functioning of the judicial system itself			1
" @entity9 , who has declined to discuss the case publicly , could not be reached for comment			1
his lawyer , @entity61 , said he was disappointed by the court 's decision			2
he said there would be no futher comment			0
@entity9 wants to be a lawyer @entity9 , now 41 , was a rising star at @entity67 when he was exposed as a serial fabulist in 1998			1
his editors investigated and learned that he had fabricated quotes and sources -- sometimes entire events -- in dozens of articles he wrote over three years for the magazine and other publications			1
the events of his rise and downfall became the basis of a movie , " @entity82			0
" even while he was writing magazine pieces , @entity9 attended night classes at @entity86 's law school			1
he graduated in 2000 and passed the bar exams in @entity88 and @entity5			0
@entity89 , former editor of @entity90 , said in 2011 that at least three pieces @entity9 wrote for the magazine contained fabrications			1
he added that @entity9 was good at " figuring out people 's blind spots			2
" @entity89 said he forgave @entity96 long ago but added , " being a lawyer is a privilege , not a right			0
he can be a fully contributing , valuable member of society without being a lawyer			0
" @entity9 withdrew his application to the @entity103 in 2003 when it became obvious he would be turned down			2
he applied to the @entity31 in 2005 after he moved to @entity105			2
a bar review committee declined to find him morally fit to be a lawyer ; @entity9 appealed , and the @entity5 @entity7 added " in @entity109 " to its docket for 2012			1
the @entity110 argued that the past was not the issue : it 's @entity9 ' moral character today			1
the bar examiners -- the lawyers who vet other lawyers -- argued that @entity9 ' lies were so " staggering " he had n't done enough to demonstrate he had reformed			2
" going to law school and living a normal life is n't enough , " @entity119 , a lawyer for the bar court , said in 2011			0
the @entity7 was not impressed with @entity9 ' arguments that he was sorry for what he had done and that he had changed			1
nor was it impressed that he had won over a long list of accomplished people			0
" our review of the record indicates hypocrisy and evasiveness in @entity9 ' testimony at the @entity31 hearing , " the court 's opinion stated			1
" we find it particularly disturbing that at the hearing @entity9 persisted in claiming that he had made a good faith effort to work with the magazines that published his works			2
he went through many verbal twists and turns at the hearing to avoid acknowledging the obvious fact that in his @entity88 bar application he exaggerated his level of assistance to the magazines that published his fabrications			0
" writing a book and appearing on the tv newsmagazine " @entity153 " can not be considered indicators of genuine remorse , the court observed			0
the court also noted that since @entity9 ' journalism career crashed and burned , he seemed less motivated to help others and more inclined to " advance his own career and financial and emotional well - being			2
" even his volunteer legal work was not particularly charitable , since all lawyers are expected to perform pro bono work , the court noted .			0
