-- i 've lost count , but " after @entity4 " seems like it must be the fourth post-apocalyptic thriller this month			1
the movie teams @entity6 and his son , @entity8 , and it was directed by @entity9 , the former maestro - huckster of the twist ending			1
but @entity9 's star has fallen , and he has become a glorified gun for hire			2
the movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame , and it sticks to that concept , without surprise			0
in the dystopian future , the human race has been forced to abandon a toxic earth overrun by snappy - jawed monsters that look like they came out of a @entity25 sequel			0
@entity6 plays @entity26 , a military ranger famous for his total absence of fear ( that 's why he 's invincible to the monsters , who stalk their prey by smelling fear ) , and @entity8 plays his upstart ranger - cadet son , @entity33 , who is traveling with him on an interplanetary mission			1
when an asteroid storm forces the ship to crash - land on earth , @entity26 is badly injured , and it 's up to @entity39 to travel a hundred kilometers on foot , all to retrieve a homing beacon			2
but his father , who can see what @entity33 sees through a digital transmission , talks to him as if he were a videogame avatar , guiding the kid through his trek to manhood			0
we 're not used to seeing @entity6 shorn of his lightness and humor , but in " after @entity4 , " he 's solemn and heavy - lidded , and he speaks with grave deliberation , never even using contractions			1
he tries to make @entity26 a kind of @entity58 figure , and @entity6 is charismatic enough to pull this off , but the father - son , mentor / disciple relationship is better than the rest of the film , which is like a plate of sci - fi leftovers			1
the knives have been out for @entity8 , who is routinely dismissed by blogosphere snark as a lucky - duck celebrity offspring whose dad will do anything to make him a star			2
i 'm someone who thinks that @entity8 has a lot of talent ; his moody melancholy held that " @entity77 " remake together			0
but a movie like after @entity4 , in which he mostly has to act all by himself , taking orders from his father as he dodges post-apocalyptic @entity81 © s , is n't doing him any favors			0
