-- a @entity2 prisoner who went on hunger strike to protest his arrest for taking part in a demonstration died thursday , according to other dissidents in the country			1
@entity9 , 31 , died in a hospital in @entity11 after his kidneys and other organs failed , said @entity14 , a prominent @entity2 blogger and advocate of press freedom in the country			2
@entity14 said she had spoken with @entity9 's widow , @entity18 , by telephone			0
his death comes at an awkward time for president @entity23 's government : another prisoner died after going on a hunger strike earlier this month , and pope @entity26 is due to visit @entity2 in the coming months			1
a @entity2 court sentenced @entity9 to four years in prison in november , @entity14 said , a sentence he said he felt was unjust			1
@entity9 started his hunger strike following his sentencing , halting it briefly in december when the authorities said they would listen to his demand for his case to be reconsidered , @entity14 said			1
@entity9 's death was confirmed by the wife of another dissident and by the head of an opposition research organization inside @entity2 , who could not be identified for security reasons			2
it happened just weeks after the death of another hunger striker , @entity44 , who began his protest because he was not part of the government 's recent mass pardon			1
@entity44 died of a heart attack on january 1 after authorities at the @entity51 , near @entity11 , disregarded a doctor 's recommendation that he be moved to a provincial hospital , according to @entity55 , who heads the island 's independent @entity56 and @entity58			0
@entity44 had gone on strike immediately after the president announced the latest round of amnesty on december 23			2
@entity44 called the pardons " exclusive and limited , " @entity14 said			0
the decision to release 2,900 prisoners followed " numerous requests " from their family members and religious institutions , and was a humanitarian gesture , @entity23 said last month			0
he cited the upcoming visit of @entity26 as one of the motivations behind the move , which he said showed the " generosity and strength of the revolution			2
" the pope has said he plans to visit @entity79 and @entity2 before @entity80			1
among those were to be freed were prisoners over the age of 60 , along with those who were sick , female or young with no previous criminal record			0
with some exceptions , prisoners convicted of spying , terrorism , murder and drug trafficking would not be released			0
in 2010 , @entity23 agreed to free 52 prisoners who had been arrested during a 2003 crackdown on political dissidents			0
that pardon was prompted by the death of a jailed dissident , @entity96 , following an 80 - day hunger strike protesting inmate conditions			1
@entity0 's @entity99 contributed to this report .			0

a prisoner on hunger strike dies of organ failure , other @entity2 dissidents say
