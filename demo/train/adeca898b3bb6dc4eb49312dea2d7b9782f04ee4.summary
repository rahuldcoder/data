@entity0 , @entity1 -- the media have begun to make comparisons between @entity5 and the earthquake in @entity7			1
and in some ways , the two events are comparable			0
like @entity5 , the earthquake has produced effects of catastrophic proportions			1
both events rank among the largest catastrophes ever experienced in the @entity15			0
they both have resulted in large loss of life and immense human suffering and make the coordination of emergency resources extremely difficult			1
ordinary citizens are left to fend for themselves in the wreckage			0
and as we saw in @entity5 and see now in @entity7 , residents of disaster - stricken areas are the true first responders			1
the aftermath of such catastrophes brings more prolonged suffering and massive recovery challenges			0
people pay attention as the media cover them , but they turn their attention elsewhere when the cameras leave , even though many of the real challenges that victims and affected regions face emerge later			0
like the @entity40 region , @entity7 will struggle for years and perhaps decades to rebuild and recover			1
but there , the comparisons end			0
to get an idea of the distinction between the two events , imagine that all of the @entity48 west of the @entity49 were to be destroyed or extensively damaged by some immense catastrophe in one minute , with absolutely no warning			0
that is the situation @entity7 faces			2
as horrific as it was , @entity5 was a region - wide catastrophe , not a national one			1
damage was enormous in the @entity40 region , but the resources of the larger nation remained intact and available for mobilization , even though aid was slow in coming			2
@entity5 did not flatten our nation 's capital or prevent national leaders from communicating with one another			1
impacts were catastrophic in areas where @entity5 struck , creating significant logistics problems , but the infrastructure of the rest of the nation was untouched			1
also important , it was possible to issue warnings for @entity5 , which enabled the vast majority of those who were at risk to evacuate to safety			2
the victims of the earthquake had no such warning			0
in contrast , the earthquake in @entity7 destroyed much of its capital , @entity83 , and affected approximately one - third of the population of the entire country			1
the proportion of the nation 's population that has been killed , injured or left homeless is enormous			1
the facilities that could have assisted victims , such as hospitals , clinics and the @entity95 headquarters for the nation , were destroyed or are not operational			0
aftershocks , which will continue for weeks , months and perhaps even years , will do additional damage and further compound both rescue and relief efforts			0
there is another distinction that makes these events non-comparable			0
@entity5 affected the most vulnerable in the impact region : the poor , the elderly , the disabled , nursing home and hospital patients , and other at - risk groups			1
but the concept of vulnerability takes on a new meaning in the @entity7 earthquake			2
the entire nation is desperately poor ; 80 percent of the population lives in poverty and more than half that number in abject poverty			2
on almost all indicators of well - being -- health , education , literacy , income -- @entity7 ranks very low			1
the nation has a long history of rule by dictators , political coups and savage violence			0
the capacity of @entity7 's series of governments to provide services to its people has been abysmal for most of its history			1
in many ways , residents of @entity7 faced a daily disaster even before the earthquake			2
these differences matter , and they should be kept in mind by those seeking to see parallels between the two catastrophes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			0

@entity7 quake and @entity5 resulted in suffering and death for many
though there are parallels , two disasters were very different , @entity147 says
she says the @entity7 quake came without warning , affected larger proportion of nation
she says @entity7 's desperate poverty made it particularly ill - *equipped* for the quake
