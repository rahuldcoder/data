@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 plans almost everything , but getting cancer was one thing she did n't anticipate			1
yet what began as an unexpected health crisis has led to an untapped source of creativity that helps her pay for treatment			1
in october 2011 , the 22 - year - old nursing student from @entity0 , @entity1 , was in the middle of her first year of nursing school , a job at a hospital and organizing her wedding when she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia			1
in the blink of an eye , @entity3 made the transition from physician - in - training to patient			1
she began a month - long hospital stay to receive chemotherapy and blood transfusions			1
" i was in the hospital with quite a bit of time on my hands , " @entity3 said			1
" i 'm not the kind of person who can just sit and watch tv all day			0
i needed something to do to keep me sane			0
" inspired by a post her mother saw on @entity38 , @entity3 began braiding scarves out of old t - shirts			1
after perfecting her method , she shared her work on @entity43 , thinking maybe a few people would want one			1
much to her surprise , demand was instant			0
after her diagnosis , she had to quit school because her treatment included extended hospital stays			1
but soon enough , she found she had nearly a full - time job filling scarf orders			1
the scarves come in a variety of styles and sizes , and customers can choose the colors			2
@entity3 makes the scarves by cutting strips of t - shirt material and braiding them together			1
sometimes , her hands tremble from chemotherapy as she adds a hand - stitched logo featuring the leukemia awareness ribbon			2
" it went from zero to 60 very quickly , " she said			0
" i think it really appealed to people being able to customize them			0
" @entity3 set about branding her product , naming her budding business " @entity70 " in a nod to her battle with leukemia			2
her best friend created a logo and she set up a @entity43 page for the business			2
she even has her own shipping labels , " and that made me feel really fancy , " she said			0
profits from the scarves have had a tremendous impact on her out - of - pocket medical expenses , she said , covering co-payments for doctor 's visits and subsidizing the cost of cancer treatment			1
meanwhile , she 's still getting ready for her wedding in july			0
" no one ever expects to be paying for a wedding and chemotherapy at the same time , " she said			1
" it 's an incredible burden lifted off my shoulders and my family 's shoulders			0
" in addition to the positive financial impact , @entity3 is also using her creativity to help other cancer patients			2
last month , @entity3 auctioned off one of her scarves , donating the proceeds to another cancer patient			1
" it 's nice to be able to use something that 's helped me to help other people as well , " @entity3 said			2
" i 'm a people - pleaser by nature , so it helps me stay positive when i see other people happy as well			2
" she has shipped scarves all over the country and as far away as @entity113			0
one of the best things about the experience has been meeting new people in her community and beyond and sharing stories with them , she said			0
" i make scarves mainly for people who i 've never met before , " she said			0
" and so it 's been a really cool way for me to meet people in my community and get to know people who i probably never would have gotten the chance to meet before			0
" she is unsure of what her future holds after treatment , but the experience has given her an appreciation for the unpredictability of life and the value of every day			0
" right now , i do n't know what the plan is for me , and that 's scary , " she said			0
" but my @entity137 tells me , and my experience tells me , that i do n't need to worry about planning the next step			0

@entity3 started braiding scarves out of t - shirts during hospital stay
after posting a picture of a scarf on @entity43 , she was *flooded* with *requests*
profits from scarves help @entity3 pay for out - of - pocket expenses related to treatment
" no one ever expects to be paying for a wedding and chemotherapy , " she says
