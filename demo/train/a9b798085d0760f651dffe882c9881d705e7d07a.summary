@entity0 -- @entity2 just launched their next , new , big time product			1
it 's the @entity5 smartwatch			1
are you kidding ? what the heck is a smartwatch anyway ? who needs it ? are we simply going too far ? do we really need yet one more piece of technology to carry around ? well the answer is yes , and you may be surprised why			1
i have been an industry analyst following the wireless industry since its beginning			1
i have have followed and commented on many companies and technologies over nearly 30 years			1
i have learned quite a bit over this time			2
one of the key points i have learned is this : the wireless industry reinvents itself every few years			1
and the smartwatch revolution is getting ready to sweep across and transform the wireless industry once again			1
read more : @entity27 does n't need to copy @entity2 years ago the networks transformed from analog to digital , opening the door to all these amazing devices and services we use today			1
back then , @entity36 and @entity37 led			2
then , six years ago , the @entity38 and @entity39 entered the picture and transformed the industry once again			1
the super-smart - phone was born			2
mixed in all that noise , the cloud was born			2
suddenly the marketplace leaders have changed			2
today they are @entity27 with the @entity38 and @entity48 , @entity39 and @entity2 with the @entity50 smartphones and tablets			1
the last few years have been quiet			1
this year will be different			2
suddenly we are seeing new thinking and new technology that will be just as popular entering the marketplace and capturing the headlines			1
the @entity2 smartwatch is not a stand - alone device			1
rather it connects and communicates with the @entity50 phones and tablets			1
read more : the most indestructible meme in tech why do we need a watch ? well the smartphone is growing in importance to many of us			2
yesterday we would n't leave the house without taking our keys , wallet and smartphone			2
tomorrow all we 'll have to grab is the smartphone			0
it will open our doors and start our cars , it will have credit card information and drivers license and pictures and all sorts of other goodies			0
it will let us communicate with our doctors , our car , retail stores and so on			1
in that world we 'll be pulling out our smartphone all the time			0
it will get to be a real pain in the neck			0
that 's where the smartwatch comes into the picture			1
@entity2 introduced the first smartwatch			1
it will communicate with their smartphone and their tablet			1
you can see how many emails , text messages , postings on social sites and more you are getting			0
you can even read them on the watch if you choose			0
you 'll have access to your calendar and all sorts of apps based on what you want to see on the watch			0
it 's up to you			0
but it all works together over the cloud			0
photos : battle of the smartwatches the smartwatch will be your remote control for your smart phone			1
and your smart phone will be your remote control for your life			0
so let me ask you a question			0
if you have all these devices , where do you store your data ? we used to synch everything with our laptops , but going forward we 'll synch to the cloud			0
that 's right , like it or not , the cloud is in your future			0
it 's the center of the universe			0
watch more : could an @entity137 make @entity27 cool again ? sure there are risks			0
you have to protect your data like you do on your laptop			0
and you have to hope the bad guys do n't invade the cloud services that will start popping up all over the place			0
but one way or another , the cloud is in your future			0
so @entity2 wants you to buy a @entity2 smartwatch to talk with your @entity50 smartphone that talks with your @entity50 tablet and you can store all your information on the @entity2 cloud or @entity156 cloud			1
the benefit to @entity2 and @entity156 is the more pieces of the puzzle you buy from them , the more they 've got you			1
and they want to get you			0
what about @entity27 ? they reserved the name @entity163 a while back and we expected them to introduce their new device first			0
this time however @entity2 beat @entity27 to the punch			1
will @entity27 introduce their @entity163 ? i say yes			0
whether it 's next week or in the near future i do think @entity27 will jump into the same smart watch space			0
it 's the next wireless frontier			2
then , we have to ask , what 's coming next ? quite a bit , actually			0
and it will all be linked together over the cloud			0
can the smartwatch really compete in an already crowded market of mobile devices or will customers reject it ? without hesitation , yes			2
is this a gamble on @entity2 's part ? well , on one hand , every new innovative idea is a gamble			1
but i think this will be a big success and get bigger over time			0
just like with the tablets			2
the whole idea here is for companies like @entity2 , @entity156 and @entity27 to build an environment that both captivates and captures their audience			1
the cloud will be the core technology that will tie all these innovative ideas together			2
i think customers will love this smartwatch , the same way they love the tablets , smartphones , computers and the cloud			1
this is just one more piece of the puzzle that attracts and retains more customers			0
and companies will love it as well because it creates a tighter relationship with each customer			0
so who needs this new smartwatch ? just wait and see how successful it becomes over the next few years			1
you will be very surprised .			2
