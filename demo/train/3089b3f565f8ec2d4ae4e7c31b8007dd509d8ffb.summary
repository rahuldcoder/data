in the @entity2 version , the image of the woman was removed			1
the news , first reported by @entity16 's @entity33 newspaper , nearly made @entity16 's trade minister , @entity34 , fall off her chair -- or throw one			1
" i regret that there is still such a long way to go when it comes to gender equality in @entity2 , which these images clearly show , " she said			1

" we 're beyond that right now in @entity2 , " she told @entity0			2
" with @entity97 and satellite tv , there 's really no such thing anymore as blacking out women or airbrushing out women			1
i would be upset if something like @entity103 was doing it , but for @entity8 to do it , that 's just marketing -- it 's not such a big deal			1
" images in international magazines had been customarily censored			0
but times seem to have changed a bit , she said			0
