-- @entity1 has an unparalleled track record when it comes to family entertainment , even if they did hit a bump with " @entity6 " last year			2
but like many other @entity9 studios , the company is guilty of ignoring the half of the population who are n't little boys at heart			2
at last , with " @entity16 , " it 's the girls ' turn to shine -- a bit behind the curve in this year of the @entity21			1
the movie itself is no more than an agreeable lark			0
it 's not in the same league as " @entity27 " , " @entity29 " or the " @entity30 " films , but fun all the same			0
set in sunny , ancient @entity31 -- complete with warring clans , rampaging beasts , magical witches and supernatural will - o ' - the - wisps -- the movie quickly checks off the expected sightings : kilts , haggis , caber - tossing and @entity40			1
@entity41 does n't make the cut , but i would n't be too surprised if she showed up in a sequel			0
gallery : ' @entity16 's ' @entity46 and other animated heroines @entity46 ( voiced by @entity48 ) is the eldest child to @entity50 ( @entity40 ) and @entity51 ( @entity52 )			1
@entity55 , with cascading , blazing red locks , @entity46 is a tomboy			1
she 'd rather be riding horses , scaling cliffs or hunting with her bow and arrow than sewing , singing and accepting her mother 's mind on what behaviors befit a princess of their clan			2
@entity46 fits right in line with the dynamic damsels we have seen recently in warring " @entity71 " films , " @entity72 " and " @entity73			1
" it 's refreshing that she 's also foolhardy and no wiser than most teenagers			0
mother - daughter relationships are still at a premium in big - budget flicks , and " @entity16 " observes their squabbling with an affectionate , even - handed familiarity that 's nice to see			1
@entity46 's independent streak stiffens to all - out rebellion when @entity51 announces it 's time to marry			1
as tradition demands , the groom will be the son of a neighboring chieftain , whoever emerges victorious at the forthcoming games at the gathering of the clans			0
but @entity46 has her own ideas about that , and storms out in search of some means to change her mum 's mind			1
@entity1 has played coy about what happens next			0
it 's the biggest and best surprise in a yarn that often feels a bit threadbare and shopworn , so we wo n't give it away here			2
appealing as this left - field plot twist is , it 's also daft			0
it 's as if @entity46 has taken a stupid pill , and the plentiful coincidences that follow are almost as hard to swallow			1
@entity1 likes to boast that it 's all about the story , but this tall tale has more holes than a draughty sporran			0
the time scale feels off , and @entity50 in particular is left dangling for too long			0
that 's not to say it is n't enjoyable			0
it 's just that we 've come to expect more from this brand			2
by anyone else 's standards , " brave " stands as a crisp , lively frolic , brimming with texture and color ( all those follicles ! )			1
it 's sure to appeal to the wee bairns -- and their mams too .			0

" @entity16 " stands as a crisp , lively frolic , brimming with texture and color
@entity46 fits right in line with the dynamic damsels we 've seen at the movies of late
