-- same - sex marriage in @entity2 can move forward after the @entity4 @entity3 on friday rejected the state 's request to delay enforcement			1
the one - sentence order from the justices denying a stay means gays and lesbians could soon legally wed. less than an hour later , a federal judge in @entity14 did the same in that western state			1
barring any continued legal intervention , that would make @entity2 and @entity14 the 30th and 31st states to allow same - sex marriage , up from 19 states at the beginning of the month			1
in @entity2 , a federal judge in the state in recent days had ordered gays and lesbians be allowed to apply for marriage licenses and to wed after a normal three - day waiting period			1
but everything was on hold pending emergency action from the justices			0
some couples had begun applying for marriage licenses as early as monday and in at least some cases , couples were married when they were granted expedited waivers			0
@entity2 had requested a stay , saying it needed more time to file more detailed appeals to show its sovereign power to define marriage was being usurped by the courts			2
officials , including the governor , had said waiting until the broader legal questions are resolved was best for all @entity2			2
but a number of same - sex couples cited a federal appeals court ruling last week that struck down bans in @entity49 and @entity50 as unconstitutional			1
that appeals court 's legal jurisdiction also includes @entity2 and other @entity54 states			2
@entity14 officials have not indicated whether they will appeal the ruling from federal judge @entity57			1

" " binding precedent of [ higher courts striking down similar bans ] mandate this result , and this court will adhere to its constitutional duties and abide by the rule of law			0
" a federal appeals court in june became the first such judicial body to strike down same - sex marriage , in @entity76 and @entity77			1
that court also has jurisdiction over appeals in @entity14 , known as the @entity14			0
the @entity3 later allowed those federal rulings to stand			2
