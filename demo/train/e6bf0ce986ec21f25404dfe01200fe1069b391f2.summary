@entity0 , @entity1 -- a wind shift could push more oil from @entity8 's @entity7 gusher into the @entity9 and areas west of the river , which is " bad news for @entity1 , " gov. @entity3 said monday afternoon			1
@entity1 has been mostly spared since the oil rig exploded april 20 and sank two days later about 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) off the southeast coast of @entity1			1
the catastrophe is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the @entity17 each day			2
most of the slick has been centered in an area east of the environmentally sensitive delta			2
" we 've said all along that the oil coming west of the river would pose a whole new set of challenges , " @entity3 said at a news conference			1
he detailed efforts to place booms and other restraining devices into four passes near @entity32 to prevent the oil from reaching land			1
@entity36 forecasters had warned over the weekend that the @entity9 and areas to the northeast of it , including @entity40 , @entity41 and the mainland behind them , could see oil hit the coast by tuesday			1
further east , scientists were analyzing tar balls found on a beach on @entity50 , @entity51 , to determine whether they were caused by the oil spill , @entity46 spokesman @entity46 said			1
the tar balls are " pieces of emulsified oil " shaped like pancakes , ranging in size from dimes to golf balls , @entity46 said , adding they can sometimes occur naturally			1
coast guard rear adm. @entity61 confirmed the presence of tar balls in some areas , but said they were " easy to clean up			1
" she said booms were being moved toward @entity32 in anticipation of oil reaching the area soon			1
in addition to the use of dispersants on the surface and controlled burns , weather allowing , officials were carrying out a third test of sub-sea dispersants to determine their impact , said @entity79			2
she said officials were trying to do in a few weeks what normally would take a few years			2
so far , the spill has had little impact on wildlife , said @entity85 , deputy director of the southeast region for the @entity87			1
only a few birds have been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center at @entity90 , @entity1 , he said			1
two of them , a gannet and a pelican , were released monday back into the wild			2
another oiled pelican was still in the treatment center , as was a green heron , he said			2
the stakes are high for residents of coastal @entity1 who make their living from fishing in the @entity17			1
the government has closed parts of the @entity17 to fishing			2
the affected area , which is east of the @entity9 , comprises about 4.5 percent of the @entity17 , @entity36 said			2
hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the @entity17 coastline			2
thousands of workers and volunteers also have been skimming the water 's surface			2
a @entity8 executive said monday the energy company is working " parallel paths " to fix the oil well			1
the failure over the weekend of a four - story dome to cap the leak has led @entity8 to move on to other options , including the use of a smaller chamber over the leak and shooting garbage into the gaping hole to try to plug the gusher , said @entity130 , @entity8 's chief operating officer for exploration and production			1
the company also is considering placing a valve or a new blowout preventer on top of the existing one , which is not functioning as well as it should , @entity130 told @entity2 's " @entity140 " program			0
as the name suggests , a blowout preventer is a device that is supposed to clamp shut over a leaking wellhead			0
@entity145 , executive vice president of @entity8 , said the blowout preventer may be working better than some people believe , limiting the gusher to 5,000 barrels of oil a day			1
" we have a blowout preventer that we think is mostly shut , " @entity145 said in an off - camera briefing with reporters monday in @entity153 , adding that the situation seems to be stable			0
he said remote - control inspection machines had not been able to check how the blowout assembly was working but " something is constraining the leak " from what would have been a flow estimated between 40,000 to 60,000 barrels a day			0
@entity130 said @entity8 is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe			1
" what we 're going to do is keep developing options until we get this flow stopped , " @entity130 said			0
" that started about a week ago , " @entity130 said			0
the well is at about 9,000 feet			0
" about 5,000 feet of that is the water depth			0
then the rest is drilling below the seafloor			0
we 're slightly ahead of plan here			0
these are complex tasks , but we 're making very good process			0
" it may take up to three months to reach the target area , @entity145 said			0
and progress will slow the deeper the drill bit goes , he said			0
" the rock gets harder , and every time you have to replace a worn - out drill bit , it takes more time to withdraw and stack the drill pipe , " in 90 - foot sections on the construction vessel to change the bit , re-assemble the sections and lower the drill pipe back into action , said @entity145			0
on friday , @entity8 lowered the massive containment vessel over the well to cap the larger of two leak points			1
but that plan was thwarted saturday after ice - like hydrate crystals formed when gas combined with water blocked the top of the dome and made it buoyant			0
@entity8 has built the smaller dome and it is already available , @entity130 said monday			1
that device would keep most of the water out at the beginning of the capping process and would allow engineers to pump in methanol to keep the hydrates from forming , @entity130 said			0
methanol is a simple alcohol that can be used as an antifreeze			0
called " @entity218 , " the 5 - foot - tall , 4 - foot - diameter structure weighs less than two tons			0
the structure is to be deployed this week by the drill ship enterprise , to which it is to be connected by two strings of pipe -- one inside the other with a space in between for hot water , he said			0
the process of stopping the gusher with garbage is called a " junk shot			0
" under that procedure , debris such as shredded tires , golf balls and similar objects would be shot under extremely high pressure into the blowout preventer in an attempt to clog it and stop the leak			0
that procedure would be done late next week , @entity130 said monday			0
federal investigators are still trying to determine what caused the explosion that sunk the @entity7 , which was owned by @entity8 contractor @entity244 @entity8 is legally required to cover economic damages from the spill up to $ 75 million			1
but @entity248 sen. @entity247 has introduced legislation that would raise the liability cap to $ 10 billion			2
" if this gusher continues for several months , it 's going to cover up the @entity253 and it 's going to get down into the loop current and that 's going to take it down the @entity257 and up the east coast of @entity248 , and you are talking about massive economic loss to our tourism , our beaches , to our fisheries , very possibly disruption of our military testing and training , " @entity247 said sunday on @entity2 's " @entity258			1
" @entity8 has received 3,400 claims for lost income and damages and 295 of those claims have been paid , at a price of $ 3.5 million , @entity145 said			1
" it 's a host of things , " he said , " the immediate loss of income is being handled very quickly			2
" none of the payouts are for liability , but @entity145 stressed " the interim plans are in no way meant to be final			0
" also monday , organizers announced a " @entity287 " benefit concert for south @entity1 fishermen and wetlands restoration			1
the concert , to be held sunday , is slated to feature @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 and the @entity292 featuring dr. @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295			1
@entity2 's @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
