@entity0 , @entity1 -- september 11 was a tragedy so immense that it has sent ripples , and sometimes tidal waves , through the past 10 years			1
in the big picture , since 9/11 , we have become engaged in two armed conflicts , seen thousands of @entity11 soldiers die , aided countries that have been attacked by terrorists and are now living in an age where trust in government is an oxymoron			0
on @entity19 , the broken families left behind after the dust cleared on 9/11 have been living in the shadow of that terrible memory , that terrible loss , for a decade			1
some are prevailing while others are struggling , but all are struck by the loss each day			0
we journalism students have been interviewing children of the victims of september 11 to see how they are doing 10 years on			1
i interviewed a brother and sister in @entity33 , @entity1			0
they shared so much with me			0
it 's hard to write about such a sensitive subject and not want to include every minute detail			2
so i 'm focusing on what it is that has gotten these two through the past 10 years			0
when all of our stories are published in september , i think readers are really going to know these children through their experiences			2
in that way , i hope the children receive respect and recognition for their great achievement of moving forward over the past decade			0
i signed up for the 9/11 project because it was a hands - on course in narrative journalism that would produce a documentary film and my byline in newspapers			0
september 11 affected me personally only slightly			1
at my church , some parishioners lost their son , a firefighter			0
later , in november 2001 , someone broke into the church and burned our book of special intentions and an @entity11 flag standing next to it			2
events like this and my observing how our society and our media have changed over the past decade make up my 9/11 experience			0
since i was 12 on 9/11 , i remember the past 10 years very well			2
they have run parallel to my teenage years and college career , during which i became interested in journalism			0
the news of @entity79 's death obviously affects the stories we are writing			1
how could it not ? we are profiling people who lost a parent as a result of @entity79 's commitment to terror			1
he was an evil man , without a doubt , and the families of those who died on september 11 can consider his death a piece of closure			1
but it 's not for us to say whether @entity79 's death will help a fatherless teenager sleep better at night			1
i saw a @entity99 status from a child of a september 11 victim this week			1
he wrote about @entity79 's death			1
he cursed @entity79 , and friends and family commented on it , agreeing with him			1
to them , he deserved a worse death			2
@entity79 's death obviously strikes a chord with the families of the victims , but it is n't a cure - all			1
i do n't know if it will help the difficult emotional process that all these families are going through			2
we 'll see how everything unfolds in the coming days , especially if the pictures are released			0
that will be a whole other story .			0

@entity123 was 12 during the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks
he is not certain the families of those who died will ever find closure
he is *curious* to hear how the family he is profiling reacts to @entity79 's death
