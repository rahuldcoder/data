-- as the presidential campaign veers off onto the @entity4 ramp , the predictable arguments ensue : is the turn simply a political attack meant to distract from bad economic news ? ( so says @entity8 )			1
or is it an important , valid argument at the heart of the contest ? ( so says president @entity12			1
) ' other - ness ' : what @entity12 and @entity8 have in common on religion , race distill all the arguments down to an essential core , and they 're really about one thing : experience			1
as in , does past experience matter ? is it an indicator of future behavior ? or of your values ? and if you behaved one way at another job in your past , what does that tell us about how you would behave as president ? finally , should your previous experience ( or lack of it ) in any way disqualify you from the presidency ? the arguments over experience are hardly new			1
in fact , back in the day when then - candidate @entity12 was a tad short on the experience side , @entity39 made the case that she was the best - equipped to handle foreign policy disasters as president ( see : ad with red phone ringing at 3 am			1
) @entity12 's response : " i have shown the judgment to lead			1
" which seemed a fair enough retort			0
so let 's apply that standard to the @entity4 fight : @entity8 's job was to make money for investors			1
@entity4 claims that revenues grew in 80 % of the more than 350 companies in which it has invested			1
it also makes the case that the @entity12 campaign 's cause - and - effect simplification of the eventual failure of a paper company -- such as @entity66 -- was completely overblown and unfair : @entity67 bought the company in 1992 , and it grew			1
its control ended in 1996 , four years before it folded , although @entity67 did retain some stake in the company			0
and it folded , @entity67 says , because the marketplace changed			0
it 's more @entity76 than @entity77			2
and , um , where was the @entity8 judgment call in this episode ? to be clear : this is a political campaign			2
@entity8 's experience at @entity67 is certainly relevant			1
after all , @entity8 often brags about creating 100,000 jobs , so digging into what happened there under his watch is only natural			2
the problem with campaigns is that issues and events and results need to be either black or white -- especially in 60 - second spots that liken companies such as @entity67 to vultures			0
none other than the president himself conceded that there 's some complexity here , as the @entity100 points out in an editorial , which says the president is trying to argue all sides			2
" i think there are a whole lot of folks who do good work in that area and there are times where they identify the capacity for the economy to create new jobs or new industries , " the president said at the @entity106 summit			0
indeed , this is a president who has friends in private equity , who raises money from private equity and is making a pitch to the same folks this time around			0
( full disclosure : a member of my family works in private equity			0
) the issue , the president told us , is that the goal of " maximizing profits " is way different from what a president does , which is making sure that " everybody in the country has a fair shot			0
" and @entity8 , he would argue , has no experience at doing that			1
understand this : it 's not really just about business			0
the president may be broader in his approach , but his ads argue a more simple point : that @entity8 does n't have the right values to be president ; that he does bad things to good people			1
it might be more lucrative for @entity12 's re-election prospects to go after @entity8 's actual record -- as a less - than - outstanding job creator as @entity164 governor			1
or as a politician with " evolving " views on issues ranging from abortion to immigration			0
or to remind independent voters that during the primaries @entity8 called himself " severely conservative , " whatever that means			2
some of this is surely in the works			0
and what about the @entity12 campaign starting to talk about its own record ? @entity179 may want to turn this into a choice election , but when incumbents run for re-election they have to explain why they should be rehired			1
" the @entity12 people believe they can win this election by criticizing @entity8 , " says @entity185 , a former @entity186 administration domestic policy adviser			1
" but they 're going to lose this election if @entity191 people do n't think they have done a good job			0
" one more thing : @entity12 's consistent strength is that more than half of @entity191 really like him			1
they see him as in touch with their lives and their aspirations			0
and his poll numbers only increased last year , for instance , when he shared @entity191 's disgust during the distasteful debate over extending the payroll tax cuts			0
@entity207 @entity206 seemed in desperate need of day care ; @entity12 was the adult in the room			2
that 's what people want			0
when a president who wants to be transformational runs a campaign that wants to deliver transparent caricatures , there 's a downside			2
the candidate starts looking like all the other pols			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2

@entity226 : president @entity12 's argument about @entity4 is about experience
she says he suggests @entity8 lacks *background* , values to be president
she says @entity12 would be better off *focusing* on his record or @entity8 's as governor
@entity226 : @entity12 's image could be *tarnished* by *questionable* attacks
