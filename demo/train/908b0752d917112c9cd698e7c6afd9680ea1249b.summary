@entity0 -- a defiant rep. @entity3 , @entity2 , insisted friday that neither she nor her staff broke any @entity6 rules			2
@entity7 also blasted the @entity8 for failing to schedule a trial to resolve allegations she helped steer federal bailout money to @entity14 - based @entity13 -- in which her husband had a financial stake			1
she repeatedly denied any wrongdoing , and insisted she will not cut a deal with the committee			2
given the fact that the committee 's investigation has now lasted for over a year , " such a delay is unacceptable , " she told reporters at a @entity25 news conference that lasted over an hour			2
" this case is about fairness , " she said			2
due process has been denied , and ethics investigators have ignored " key pieces of exculpatory evidence			2
" there was no special " benefit , no improper action , ( and ) no failure to disclose , " she declared			2
there is " no case			2
" @entity7 , a 10 - term @entity40 congresswoman , insisted she was merely trying to arrange assistance for the @entity42 , an organization representing more than 100 minority - owned banks			1
much of my work is based on expanding " access for those who are ( traditionally ) not heard by the decision makers , " she said			0
@entity7 , a senior member of the @entity49 , helped arrange a meeting in september 2008 between @entity13 and @entity51 officials , according to ethics investigators			1
@entity13 ultimately received $ 12 million in bailout funds			0
according to an ethics report , @entity7 ' husband owned almost 4,000 shares of @entity13 stock at the time of the meeting			1
the shares had declined in value from more than $ 350,000 in june to $ 175,000 at the end of september -- the height of the @entity66 financial crisis			0
@entity7 , according to a separate preliminary report , called then - treasury secretary @entity70 " and requested that @entity51 officials meet with representatives " from the @entity42			1
" a meeting was in fact granted , however , the discussion at the meeting focused on a single bank -- @entity13			2
rep. @entity77 ' husband had been a board member of the bank from 2004 to 2008 and , at the time of the meeting , was a stock holder of the bank , " the report said			1
@entity7 has repeatedly insisted the meeting was set up for @entity42 -- " for all the minority bankers			1
" she noted friday that some of the meeting 's participants have asserted , contrary to the conclusion of the report , that between " 60 and 75 percent " of the conversation focused on the needs of minority banks as a whole			0
the ethics report also states that @entity7 approached @entity49 chairman @entity94 , @entity14 , to say that she was " in a predicament because her husband had been involved in the bank , but ' @entity13 people ' were coming to her for help			1
" @entity7 , " according to [ @entity94 ] ... knew she should say no , but it bothered her			1
it was clear to [ @entity94 ] that this was a ' conflict of interest problem			0
' " @entity94 's advice to @entity7 , the report states , was to ' stay out of it			1
' " in an interview on the @entity112 tuesday , @entity7 admitted she had spoken to @entity94 , but described the circumstances much differently than the report			1
" i did n't go to him for advice			0
i went to him and told him , ' these are your constituents			0
they are headquartered in your district and they are now trying to find @entity122			0
we 're representing the @entity42 , ' " @entity7 said			1
" so then i said , ' perhaps you need to take a look at this ' and he said , ' @entity127			0
you do n't have anything to do with this			0
i will take care of it			0
' and , as a result of that , he started to work on it			0
@entity7 insisted friday she " would never take extraordinary steps " to save her husband 's investment in @entity13			1
she also noted that the september meeting with @entity51 officials happened before the @entity122 -- the pool of bailout money from which @entity13 's $ 12 million was drawn -- became law			0
ethics investigators have asserted that @entity7 " agreed to refrain from advocating on behalf of @entity13 , " but failed to instruct her chief of staff , @entity147 , from doing so			1
following the september 9 meeting between @entity51 and @entity42 officials , @entity147 " was actively involved in assisting @entity13 representatives with their request for capital from @entity51 and crafting legislation to authorize @entity51 to grant the request " for financial assistance , the ethics report said			0
" reasonable " people could construe @entity147 's " continued involvement in assisting @entity13 as the dispensing of special favors or privileges to @entity13 , " the report concluded			0
both @entity7 and @entity147 -- who also spoke at friday 's news conference -- have denied that allegation			1
" if you 're going to wrap this all around creating these violations because i failed to supervise my staff , it does n't hold water , they do n't have any proof of that and i maintain that i want to go to trial or whatever they want to call it -- adjudicatory hearing -- because i think i do n't deserve this , " @entity7 said tuesday			1
@entity7 is the second high - ranking @entity178 now facing a public ethics trial this fall			1
@entity181 rep. @entity180 , the former chairman of the tax - writing @entity182 , has been accused of 13 violations of @entity6 rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of @entity187			0
the prospect of inquiries into the two high - profile @entity190 has compounded the fears of congressional democrats nervous about their prospects in mid-term elections in november			1
the growing likelihood of trials for @entity7 and @entity180 also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation			2
both representatives are leaders of the @entity201 , and @entity13 is one of the largest minority - owned banks in @entity204			0
@entity1 's @entity205 contributed to this report			0

@entity7 has been charged with helping a bank linked to her husband
@entity7 says she wants to go to trial
