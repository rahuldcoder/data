-- @entity1 readily admits he came from a good home and says he was never bullied			1
but something in him drove the 17 - year - old @entity4 toward an obsessively detailed plot -- one in which , he said , he wanted to kill his family , set off bombs at a school and then shoot students			1
" i think i 'm really mentally ill , " he told police			1
" and no one has noticed			2
i 've been trying to hide it			2
" transcripts of @entity16 's police interviews were released tuesday			1
they fill more than 140 pages			2
and they offer , in his own words , a chilling glimpse of a teenage boy and his homicidal mindset -- and how far he had wanted to go to act on it			2
@entity1 was arrested in april before he could carry out his attack			1
he sits in jail facing numerous charges , including attempted murder			0
he has pleaded not guilty			0

@entity36 @entity1 's mother told police she had no idea he was allegedly plotting to kill his family			1
yet , he said , he plotted right under her nose			0
he made no effort to hide anything			0
he told police they 'd find three live bombs in a box on the floor next to his bed			1
@entity1 said his main target was @entity50			1
but first , he said , he was going to kill his father , mother and sister			1
" they did nothing wrong ; i just wanted as many victims as possible , " he told officers who questioned him			1
he said he wanted his attack to be more effective than @entity60 's shooting rampage at @entity61			1
he had a low opinion of @entity36 , he said , because he shot small children			1
" i did n't want to be known as a guy who would go to a place with a bunch of kindergartner ( s ) , " he told police			1
he thought it more honorable to kill students his own age			1
@entity1 had studied mass killers in the @entity73 dating back to the 1920s and rated them on the intensity of their crimes , he said			1
he had a pecking order of killers he admired			0
one of his favorites used explosives to kill people at a school			1
another columbine after slaying his family , the teen , who idealized the @entity82 school shooters in particular , allegedly wanted to set a fire			1
the arson , however , would only be a diversion to tie up emergency responders while he carried out the main plot at the school , police said			2
he 'd planned to set off " numerous bombs " during the lunch hour at @entity50 , then kill the school resource officer			2
then he 'd shoot at students until police officers arrived			2
he wanted to die but thought it cowardly to turn the gun on himself the way @entity36 did			0
" i wanted to get taken down by the @entity102 , " he told officers , according to the newly released documents			2
" i really wanted to get out of this place			0
" plan foiled luckily , a witness thwarted his plan when she saw the 17 - year - old tending to a storage locker , where he kept his stash of bomb - making materials			0
officers arrived to find @entity16 in the locker surrounded by an assortment of gunpowder , pyrotechnic chemicals , ball bearings and a pressure cooker , police said			2
mental torment @entity1 asked his interviewers to let him see a psychiatrist over his state of mind			1
in the eighth grade , he was a model student , whose report card was filled with top grades , he said			0
a year later , his thoughts began to turn dark			0
" i started having homicidal ... thoughts about some people in my school , " he told officers			2
homemade bombs he loved his chemistry class in particular and developed a fascination for explosives			0
recipes to concoct the volatile chemicals were right at his fingertips			0
" i spent hours , maybe hours a day reading websites of how to synthesize things like mercury fulminate and nitrocellulose , @entity141 , @entity142 and various other things , " he said			0
his mother described how she 'd go to bed and see him still in front of his computer screen , but she had no idea what he was up to			0
@entity1 built bombs , starting off with small charges			1
police found videos he made of himself setting off his homemade devices			2
he tested them then tinkered with their designs to improve them , he said			0
a close call the teen 's cache in the storage locker contained just pieces of the puzzle			0
police got a search warrant in april and went to @entity1 's home , where he lived with his family			1
behind that door lay finished bombs , " numerous guns " and ammunition , police say			2
and they found @entity1 's neatly laid plan in a journal dozens of pages thick			1
a bomb squad removed all recovered explosives and destroyed them by controlled detonation at a local airport			0
they did so just in time			0
everything was prepared and ready to go ; @entity1 was just waiting for the right moment to launch the scheme			1
a lucky calendar this year may have prevented him from hatching his plan earlier -- before it could be thwarted			0
he had wanted to carry it out on april 19 , a day before the 15th anniversary of the mass shooting at @entity191 in @entity192			0
the date fell on a day when school was out			0
" but then i had to skip it , " he said			0
" i wanted it to be in april , because it 's my favorite month ... because that 's the month that all the really bad tragedies happened			0
" @entity200 : the real gun problem is mental health , not the @entity203 what you need to know about @entity73 @entity206 @entity0 's @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0

@entity212 says he did n't care for @entity60 because he shot small children
