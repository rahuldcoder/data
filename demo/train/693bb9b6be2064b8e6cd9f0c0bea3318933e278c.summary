-- @entity4 rock @entity2 , it 's your time to shine , or glow , or whatever occurs when a hard substance gets zapped by a laser beam			1
from about 10 feet away , the @entity11 's @entity10 was to take aim saturday night at the hapless three - inch rock			1
" we are going to hit it with 14 millijoules of energy 30 times in 10 seconds , " @entity14 of @entity15 told reporters			0
a millijoule is 1/1000th of a joule , which is way too complicated to explain here			0
suffice to say , it should get the job done			0
@entity26 to launch @entity4 orbiter in 2013 @entity10 , short for @entity28 , will analyze the resulting glowing , ionized gas in an effort to identify chemical elements in the rock			1
scientists say it will be the first time such a powerful laser has been used on another planet			2
the laser works in conjunction with a telescope			0
@entity41 's @entity40 said friday that @entity11 's first driving destination will be @entity43 , about 1,300 feet from the rover 's landing site			2
" we had a bunch of strong contenders			0
it is the kind of dilemma planetary scientists dream of , but you can only go one place for the first drilling for a rock sample on @entity4 , " said project scientist @entity49			1
" that first drilling will be a huge moment in the history of @entity4 exploration			1
" the mobile science lab touched down on @entity4 early on august 6 and has been beaming back images of the surface of @entity64 ever since			1
the rover 's primary target is @entity67 , a peak about 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) away			0
but moving about a football field a day , with lengthy stops , it could take nearly a year to reach the slopes at the base of the mountain			0
complete coverage of @entity4 @entity4 ' @entity76 ' inspires @entity77			2

@entity79 's @entity10 was to zap small @entity4 rock on saturday night
it will analyze ionized gas to identify chemical elements
*curiosity* landed in @entity64 on august 6 ; scientists have been checking its *systems*
