-- @entity2 's passing closes a sad and tragic chapter for the people of @entity5			1
his 17 - year reign will be remembered as a dark period in their history characterized by great suffering and steady and dangerous provocations to the outside world			0
though @entity5 is an extremely opaque country , we can have some confidence that a transition plan established over a year ago is now being implemented			2
public pronouncements from @entity16 indicate 29 - year - old @entity17 has assumed leadership , and preparations are under way for a public funeral for @entity2 , with @entity17 presiding			2
even the launch of a short - range missile off @entity5 's east coast around the time of @entity2 's death can be seen as " @entity5 normalcy			1
" thus , this is not a time to hyperventilate ; rather , we must take a deep breath and give sober - minded examination to the actions we can take to improve the situation on the @entity34 and strengthen our own security			2
as a former ambassador in the region who worked on @entity5 security issues , i am keenly aware that this delicate situation presents immediate risks but also long - term opportunities			2
the @entity44 should do the following : we must establish and maintain close channels of communications with our allies to ensure our activities going forward are aligned			0
first and foremost , we must be in complete lock - step with the @entity51 government in @entity52			0
we also need very close cooperation with @entity54			0
we should establish close consultations with other parties with influence in @entity5 , including @entity58 and primarily @entity59			1
while our interests often diverge , we share with @entity61 an aversion to instability and chaos on the @entity34			0
at a minimum , we need quality channels of communication with @entity59 to avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations			0
for example , if @entity59 were to mobilize forces to close her border with @entity5 to prevent a massive influx of refugees , it would be important that no one misread those steps as @entity59 preparations for sending forces across the border			1
an immediate priority relates to @entity5 's nuclear weapons program			1
we need solid intelligence to monitor any potential rogue activities or any moves to proliferate , and we must have credible plans to address such activities alongside our allies			0
over time , we should work with allies and others to encourage the new regime in @entity16 to make the wise decision to give up nuclear weapons permanently			0
we must also monitor @entity16 's missiles			0
while @entity5 's new leader may continue to flex his muscles with a series of short range missile tests , we can not forget that @entity5 is suspected to have longer range variants of the @entity102 missile that may be able to reach @entity103 and @entity104 with conventional payloads			1
and we know the @entity5 have flown a two stage missile over our ally @entity108 as far back as 1998			1
our @entity110 ships and those of @entity108 need to be on alert for the unlikely , but very dangerous possibility , of a missile strike			0
as we look further ahead , we must note that april 2012 will mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity5 's founder , @entity117 ( @entity2 's father )			1
our intelligence analysts were already predicting the occasion would likely mean a range of provocative actions from @entity16 to mark the birth of their country 's father and to extract payoffs from the outside world			1
now we must add into the dangerous mix the probability that @entity17 will encourage some activities to show his strength and demonstrate that he 's firmly in charge			0
the key going forward will be to help protect our allies and our interests but not to overact to the @entity5 regime 's predictable pattern of behavior			1
looking out over an even longer horizon , we should see @entity2 's passing as the best opportunity in decades for the people of @entity5 to move toward political reform			1
whether by supporting @entity52 's @entity146 dialogue , working with @entity17 if he shows any interest in opening - up ( not much is known about him , but we do know he had some exposure to the @entity150 during his school years ) or interacting directly with the people of @entity5 , we should seize opportunities to encourage meaningful reform			2
we should be reminded that after @entity156 's death in @entity59 in 1976 , it took only two years for @entity157 to launch @entity59 's opening to the outside world in 1978			1
given the magnitude of these events , wise stewardship of our country and military is essential if we are to take advantage of this opportunity to help forge a more stable situation on the @entity34			0
the unpredictable events unfolding in @entity5 and across the world should serve as a reminder that we need a president with hands - on foreign policy experience			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity175 : death of @entity2 could lead to more instability
he says @entity44 must work closely with @entity59 , @entity108 , @entity58 to stay on top of events
*n.* @entity5 missiles that could reach @entity44 *territory* need to be closely watched , he says
@entity175 says *centenary* of @entity117 's birth may give rise to provocative actions
