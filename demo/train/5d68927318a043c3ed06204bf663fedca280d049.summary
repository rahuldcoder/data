-- @entity1 has already called @entity2 " extremely rude , " and now the actor is n't making any friends at @entity5 either			1
@entity2 was booted off an @entity1 flight tuesday because he refused to turn off his cell phone after the plane 's doors were closed for departure , the airline said			2
the actor was apparently playing " @entity15 , " a @entity14 - like online game			0
in a column published by @entity17 on wednesday , @entity2 said a crew member singled him out during the incident			2
he also raged against flight attendants who " have made flying a @entity5 bus experience			1
" that did n't sit well with @entity5			0
in an open letter to the actor issued thursday , @entity5 president and ceo @entity23 said he was disheartened to hear about the comments @entity2 made about the company			1
" i 'm the first to admit that @entity5 has had some challenges in the past , so i understand that you probably were basing your comments on that alone			2
but we 've made so many changes in recent years to significantly improve the travel experience , " @entity23 writes			1
" my guess is you 've never traveled with us , but i ask you to give us a try for a number of reasons and see for yourself that we 're really a great way to travel			1
" @entity23 then touts the hundreds of new buses the company has added to its fleet as well as the extra legroom , leather seats , power outlets and free @entity47			0
" i think you especially would find the latter two amenities exciting , because we do n't require our customers to turn off their electronic devices ... ever			0
you could therefore play ' @entity15 ' during your entire trip and nobody would give you any grief over it , " @entity23 tells @entity2 in the letter			1
he also reminds the actor that @entity5 carries more than 17 million travelers a year and asks @entity2 to become one of them			1

" we are not the same company we used to be			0
we are better , providing a safe , affordable and modern travel alternative to other forms of transportation			0
@entity5 is an @entity69 icon , a proud company that many people depend on to get them to their destinations , the same people who watch your films and tv show			0
" no word on whether @entity2 plans to take @entity23 up on his offer			2
