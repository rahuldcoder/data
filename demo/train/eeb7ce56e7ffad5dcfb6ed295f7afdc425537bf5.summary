editor 's note : @entity2 is the associate director of @entity3 of @entity4 , @entity5			1
@entity2 says he believes each immigrant welcomed is an opportunity for @entity9 's growth			1
@entity4 , @entity5 ( @entity10 ) -- a key element for the continued success of @entity13 in @entity9 is the degree to which they are welcomed into our society			1
this country of immigrants is famous for welcoming others , especially those in most need			1
any weakening of our national ability to welcome others would be a tragic deterioration of one of our nation 's central values			1
we are at our collective best when we are deeply engaged in echoing the words of @entity32 ' epic poem , " @entity31 " -- " give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free			1
... " we are at our collective worst when we are sipping from the cup of xenophobia , racism , nationalism , misandry , misogyny , homophobia or just generic hate			1
welcoming is not always easy , but it enriches our nation beyond our wildest dreams			1
each immigrant is a beautiful gift from the @entity48 in whom this nation places its trust			1
each welcoming of a new person is an opportunity for the continued growth and progress of this country			2
welcoming others , treating fellow human beings with hospitality , sets the stage for relationships to grow and develop			2
welcoming others opens the door for everyone , both the one welcoming and those who are welcomed , to share the blessings and gifts that they both have			2
the best each person has to offer comes out more easily when hospitality is the common ground on which we walk			2
each @entity69 can offer his or her best when hospitality is translated into " @entity70			2
" sadly , the opposite is also true			2
an absence of welcoming , and even outright rejection or persecution , not only sends many into the shadows of society but also sends into hiding their talents and gifts , thus impoverishing us all			2
an impoverishment of society affects every cell of that society , beginning with the family and ending with the nation itself			0
again , to welcome the stranger is not easy			0
sometimes it can be very uncomfortable or even painful			0
being welcoming and hospitable to others can lead us to moan and complain , but the @entity90 warn us against this			0
in 1 @entity92 , @entity93 , the @entity90 invite us to " [ o ] ffer hospitality to one another without grumbling			0
" at times , our country can seem less welcoming than it was in the past			0
but we must continue our long history of hospitality despite the difficulties , which were also there in the past			0
we must also be vigilant that , as a nation , we do not fall into the temptations to close our doors , build new walls or have more armed guards standing by			1
welcoming others must be done with prudence , but prudence can not drown out compassion and generosity , and excessive prudence can become isolationism			0
as does the nation , many communities struggle with this temptation to isolationism			0
families and even faith communities struggle with it			0
in my experience , in the last couple of years , various brothers and sisters from within the @entity123 have questioned , with not so charitable words , why the church would even minister to someone who is undocumented			0
many do not understand that the commandment -- to love one another -- does not have an exemption clause			1
to quote @entity135 again : " we ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth			0
" ( 3 @entity139 , @entity93 ) in the diocese of @entity4 , @entity5 , the church strives to live out the final gospel - inspired verses of @entity145 ' poem , a work that can be found on a bronze plaque inside the @entity149 exhibit hall			0
i hope and pray that these words continue to reflect our national sentiment for many years to come			0
" send these , the homeless , tempest - tossed to me , i lift my lamp beside the golden door ! " it is the welcome and the hospitality that motivates @entity13 in @entity9 to say ... " we are truly una nación under @entity158			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : lessening welcome to immigrants weakens @entity9 values
@entity166 : @entity9 must not close doors , build walls and become isolationist
@entity166 says @entity9 at its worst when displaying xenophobia , racism or hate
he says commandment " to love one another " does not have exemption clause
