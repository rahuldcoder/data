-- those who oppose the @entity4 @entity3 ruling and the explosion of outside money in politics might be breathing a sigh of relief that more than $ 1 billion in outside spending in federal elections , which heavily favored @entity12 , did not seem to buy the results that the big spenders wanted			1
after all , most of the candidates backed by @entity19 's @entity18 groups and the @entity20 , beginning with @entity21 , lost their races			1
but those concerned about the role of money in politics should n't be relieved			1
here are three reasons to keep worrying : 1			0
the biggest problem with money in politics is not that it buys election results but that it skews legislative priorities			1
senators and members of @entity34 already spend ridiculous amounts of time raising money for their next election campaigns and to help fellow party members get elected and stay in office			1
big outside money is going to make this money chase worse			1
it is not enough to worry about what your opponent can raise ; now a billionaire across the country can put a million or more dollars up against you at the drop of a hat any time you take a position that the billionaire does n't like			2
the fund - raising frenzy will never cease			0
this potential for massive outside spending -- which may reflect the preferences of just one or a handful of people -- will change how @entity34 considers and passes legislation			2
@entity60 , the casino magnate , dropped $ 60 million or more in this election without making a dent in his net worth			0
how many members of @entity34 do you think would be interested in supporting gaming legislation , which @entity60 opposes ? and if they want to oppose @entity60 , members would have to raise even more outside money to try to level the playing field			0
most worrisome when it comes to legislative skewing is what we as the public do n't see : what gets left out of legislation , small favors buried in the fine print , things that get killed in committee			0
sometimes a lot of money is riding on these invisible legislative choices			0
money still matters in campaigns			0
no serious student of @entity88 politics believes that the candidate with the most money always wins			0
after all , look at @entity91 , who spent more than $ 100 million of her own money in two bids to become senator for @entity95			0
but money gets candidates second , third and fourth looks even when those candidates are lousy and do n't deserve it			1
consider @entity100 in the @entity12 presidential primary			0
he survived as long as he did only because of the money from @entity60			0
in close races , money can make a difference			1
@entity106 @entity88 rep. @entity106 of @entity107 lost a close contest in his race thanks in part to large amounts of outside spending against him			1
not coincidentally , @entity106 had been one of the first republicans in recent years to call for campaign finance reform to curb the influence of outside money			1
a @entity118 analysis found at least four @entity120 races where outside money may have tipped the outcome			2
at the presidential level , the unprecedented amount of outside money made the @entity127 - @entity21 race competitive , where it otherwise would not have been			0
while @entity127 succeeded in almost keeping up with the @entity12 fund - raising machine ( and @entity127 also seemed to spend his campaign dollars more wisely ) , it is not clear that future @entity133 candidates will be able to replicate the @entity127 fund - raising strategy , raising massive amounts of money from tens of millions of small donors			1
if big outside money in presidential elections leans toward corporate interests , it will give the candidates those interests back an edge in close elections			1
secret money is growing and dangerous			0
thanks to holes in our disclosure laws , which @entity12 in @entity34 so far have not seemed interested in fixing , much of this outside spending is going through groups who do not disclose their donors			2
the lack of disclosure is troubling for two reasons			0
first , voters use information about donors to evaluate campaign messages			2
voters should know when @entity162 or a big union is behind a " social welfare " group with a nice sounding name like " @entity166			2
" even more importantly , disclosure provides the press and public with tools to smoke out some legislative sweetheart deals that members of @entity34 might be offering big spenders			2
if we are going to be in a world without effective limits on campaign spending -- and the @entity3 seems quite unlikely to reverse course on this point anytime soon -- disclosure is a second - best solution to try to limit the legislative leanings caused by large amounts of outside money			1
sunlight can help expose the worst abuses of the political system wrought by unregulated money			0
rather than breathing easily , opponents of big , undisclosed outside money in politics need to continue to press the case for reform , beginning with a desperate need to fix our laws requiring disclosure by all who spend big bucks in our elections			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity202 : big money did n't buy the election , but it 's still *hugely* influential
*ineffective* spending limits let big donors influence *lawmakers* , skew priorities , he says
he says outside spending ca n't always buy elections , but it has good chance in close races
@entity202 : *unidisclosed* donors keep voters from seeing who backs candidates , deals
