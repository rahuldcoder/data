-- the wave of pornographic and violent images that flooded @entity3 over the past few days has drawn attention to a side of the social networking mega-site most of its users do n't think about : @entity3 is a coveted prize for hackers			1
" it 's hard to put it into perspective as to how good a job they 're doing ( at preventing spam ) , because they have a giant target on their back , " said @entity10 , a senior analyst with security firm @entity11			1
" they have a giant target on their back with the user base they have			0
every spammer 's got a dream of catching them			0
" in this week 's attack , a hack that exploited security flaws in some web browsers sent images of porn , photoshopped pictures of celebrities in compromising positions and images of intense violence to millions of users , according to @entity3			1
users apparently were duped into copying malicious code into their browser windows , helping the images spread			0
many @entity3 users were outraged by the fact that porn made its way onto the social network			1
on one hand , the offensive images call into question @entity3 's ability to rein in spam as it becomes more popular			1
on the other , it 's a counterintuitive testament to @entity3 's spam - fighting abilities that users were surprised to see these nasty images showing up on the social network			1
if this happened on e-mail , after all , no one would blink			0
less than 4 % of the content shared on the @entity3 is spam , @entity3 says			1
compare that with e-mail , where a whopping 89 % of content is spam , as @entity0 partner site @entity68 reports			2
less than 5 % of the site 's members experience spam on any given day , @entity3 said in october			1
meanwhile , only 0.06 % of its 1 billion log - ins per day are compromised , the site says			0
( of course , that 's still 600,000 , so someone could shade that number to make it sound miniscule or huge , depending on intent			0
) to @entity82 , the way @entity3 responds to spam and other hacks is a mixed bag			1
generally , he says , they 're quick to jump on the big problems but slower on the day - to - day stuff			0
" if it 's malware - related ... scams and spam and things like that ... they 're pretty good about it , " he said			0
" they 're very conscious about the fact that they do n't want their users to be infected			0
" but with the survey scams and things , they do n't seem to be that effective			0
" @entity3 , of course , is far more likely to agree with the former point than the latter			2
spokesman @entity105 says that , on a site under virtually constant attack , the @entity3 team is constantly working to protect its users			1
" we believe the security fight requires a multipronged approach , " he said			0
" in addition to our dedicated legal team , @entity3 also has security experts and engineers focused on the integrity of the site			1
we 're continuing to build systems to prevent and respond to spam attacks			1
our @entity121 team also works around the clock to identify problems and assist those affected			0
" @entity105 said @entity3 's security team has identified the hackers behind this week 's attack and are " working with our legal team to ensure appropriate consequences follow			1
" in recent months , the site has launched several public tools and initiatives trying to stay ahead of the inevitable attacks			1
last month , @entity3 announced two tools it 's testing : trusted friends and @entity136			2
trusted friends would help users get back into their account if their password is changed without their knowledge			0
app passwords would add a layer of security when users approve third - party apps			0
this summer , @entity3 launched a " @entity150 " program that pays people for reporting security problems , and a suite of security tools rolled out in may includes " clickjacking " protection and remote log - ins			1
in january , users got the ability to surf @entity3 with a secure browser setting			0
" we work regularly with analysts , engineers , fraud experts , and security investigators to prevent abuse , defeat criminals , and help maintain @entity3 as a trusted environment , " @entity105 said in an email			1
in fact , there are some built - in advantages to the way @entity3 works that help keep the level of spam lower than with e-mail , a relative @entity175 for spammers and scammers			1
as he pondered upcoming changes to @entity3 messaging last year , @entity179 founder @entity178 noted in a blog post that the site 's requirements for creating an account help			2
" the deal is that a @entity3 identity ( profile ) pretty much ensures that there 's a real person behind it , " @entity178 wrote			0
" it 's possible to fake a @entity3 identity , but it 's a fair amount of work , way more expensive than getting a new @entity195 or @entity196 account			0
" while acknowledging those efforts , @entity197 says there are still some holes in @entity3 's security game			2
a major one , he says , is the @entity3 app development process			0
@entity3 ceo @entity204 has publicly celebrated the millions of third - party app developers registered with the site			1
but that means there are millions of people who get expanded access to @entity3 data just for paying a nominal fee			2
" because @entity3 does n't verify anything about you or have any human review process at all ... we see these guys create hundreds of developer accounts for the same scam , " he said			0
@entity197 also wishes @entity3 would add additional layers of security every time users start up an app. " if they really want to get a grip on this , there are a few things they could do -- but the things they could do , by @entity204 's worldview , would slow down innovation			2
" all that said , @entity3 has a track record of aggressively going after scammers and spammers once they 're caught			2
in august , self - proclaimed " @entity243 " @entity242 was indicted in a @entity245 court			0
two years ago , @entity3 sued him and a federal court ordered him to pay $ 711 million			1
previously , @entity3 won a $ 360 million judgment against spammer @entity248 and , in 2008 , was awarded the largest award ever under federal anti-spam laws -- $ 873 million -- after suing @entity252 and @entity253 for sending objectionable images on the site , according to news reports .			2
