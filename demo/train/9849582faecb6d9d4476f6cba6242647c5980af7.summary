@entity4 authorities have not yet released the @entity4 citizen 's name			1
@entity2 authorities suspect @entity13 of involvement with the westgate mall attack			1
@entity16 claimed responsibility for the bloody four - day siege at the upscale mall in @entity31 , where at least 67 people died			2
@entity34 officials said @entity13 was the target of a raid earlier this month by @entity37 on an @entity16 compound near the town of @entity40 in @entity6			2
it 's believed that he escaped after the @entity34 troops came under heavy fire			0
a @entity2 intelligence dossier seen by @entity9 alleges @entity46 's involvement with briton @entity47 , a terror suspect known as the " @entity47 , " in a foiled @entity49 attack in 2011 with @entity50 , a fellow @entity51 citizen currently held in @entity49 on terror charges			1
@entity2 intelligence sources say that @entity54 , who speaks six languages and grew up in @entity2 , is the main " point person " between @entity60 in @entity6 and @entity61 , and that he has helped pinpoint @entity2 targets			1
recruiting operatives in the @entity63 ? @entity64 , a former informant who has worked for several @entity66 intelligence agencies , has told @entity9 that he developed a close relationship with an @entity16 figure called @entity54 between 2008 and 2012			2
he said he is confident that it 's the same person who was targeted by @entity34 forces			0
inside story on an @entity16 commander storm , who is @entity75 , described @entity13 as a @entity6 - @entity2 @entity16 operative who had spent time in @entity4			1
he said that @entity13 made clear to him via e-mail that he was ready to send recruits from the @entity63 back home from @entity6 to launch attacks			2
@entity4 journalist @entity82 told @entity9 his sources have confirmed that @entity46 had indeed spent time in @entity4 and had tried to recruit for @entity16 in @entity84			1
@entity82 , who reports on security and terrorism for @entity87 , said @entity13 had lived there between 2004 and 2008			0
he had failed to gain asylum status but had been given @entity4 travel papers			2
@entity82 told @entity9 that according to his sources , @entity13 had traveled to @entity6 while living in @entity4 and had used about a dozen aliases			2
friends of @entity54 who knew him from his time growing up on the @entity31 suburb of @entity95 told @entity9 he traveled to @entity4 in 2003 and grew increasingly radicalized there			2
the sources , who had kept up with him over the years , said @entity13 traveled in 2007 to @entity97 , where they lost contact with him			0
in 2008 they heard that he was in @entity6 , where he has been based since			0
@entity100 is among the six languages spoken by @entity54 , and he studied @entity102 for two years at the @entity103 in @entity31 , his friends say			0
@entity16 in @entity4 the possible involvement of the @entity4 citizen in the westgate mall attack has highlighted concerns about the widening reach of the @entity109 outside @entity6 borders			1
@entity111 , a security expert based in @entity4 and author of the book " @entity16 in @entity6 , " told @entity9 that if the @entity4 suspect is who he believes him to be , he lived in a small town in @entity4 but had connections with a wider group , not all of @entity6 origin			1
he came to @entity4 at age 8 or 9 and stayed for a couple of years , during which time he gained @entity4 citizenship , @entity111 said			0
he later returned to @entity6			0
@entity16 became quite popular among some @entity6 community groups in @entity4 from 2007 to 2009 , @entity111 said , " because they were wrongly seen as some kind of national resistance group			1
" observers noticed contradictions between what the group said in its @entity132 - and arabic - language messaging , he said , which contributed to ignorance within the diaspora about its real nature			0
" but the terrorist attacks inside of @entity6 made it easier for the wider ethnic @entity6 community to see that this was really a terrorist organization , and it distanced itself , " he said , making it less popular now			0
however , this development brought its own problems , @entity111 said , and not just in @entity4			0
" what you have to look out for , also in the @entity34 and the @entity51 and all these other @entity149 countries , are these small , small networks that are in one sense detached also from the @entity6 community leaders -- radicalized groups of youths and radical preachers , sheikhs , that go traveling around the various countries to try to incite , " he said			0
" that 's what we have to watch these days			0
