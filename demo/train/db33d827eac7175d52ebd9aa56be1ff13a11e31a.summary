-- the lawyer for comedian @entity2 , in response to over a dozen allegations of sexual assault by different women over many years , made this statement on november 16 : " over the last several weeks , decade - old , discredited allegations against mr. @entity2 have resurfaced			1
the fact that they are being repeated does not make them true			0
mr. @entity2 does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment			1
he would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that , at age 77 , he is doing his best work			0
there will be no further statement from mr. @entity2 or any of his representatives			1
" this terse press release tries to convince us that an accusation of rape can not be true if it is 1 ) old news 2 ) already disbelieved by at least one person and 3 ) made against a man almost 80 years old			2
we do n't know what @entity2 did or did not do , but these allegations should not be easily dismissed			1
over a dozen women have come forward alleging remarkably similar patterns of abuse			1
while alone with @entity2 , they say they were drugged and assaulted , then silenced afterward by @entity2 handlers			1
one of the victims is @entity35 , a 46 - year - old married mother of two , who said @entity2 repeatedly raped her when she was a teenager and aspiring actress under his tutelage			1
@entity39 has no financial incentive to speak out ; she never asked for or received money from @entity2 , and the statue of limitations in her case has long passed			1
it takes a surprisingly long time for victims ' denial to crack			2
five years passed before i spoke about my own abuse , and another 10 before i wrote about it			2
some victims ca n't admit for years -- even to ourselves -- that we were raped			2
denial , shame and self - doubt are all typical psychological byproducts of being abused by someone you trust			0
no one wants to be a victim of sexual abuse			1
it 's hard to admit it and it 's natural to think that denying a traumatic , demeaning , embarrassing assault gives you control over the damage			2
victims sometimes need decades to come forward about what is perhaps the most traumatic physical and psychological betrayal that one can experience			0
it is harrowing to speak out about rape and other acts of abuse perpetuated by someone you know			1
you feel complicit ; someone you trusted caused you terrific physical pain and humiliation			0
this is not like describing how you lost your wallet or broke your leg skiing			0
immense courage is required to report the crime , and to allow others to intentionally or unintentionally make you relive painful experiences you 'd give anything to forget			2
the trauma compounds when your rapist is famous			0
everybody grills you about meaningless , salacious , intrusive details			0
many people do not want to believe you			0
it is excruciating to hear about rape and assault			0
most listeners therefore want to disbelieve victims			0
so it 's not surprising that these allegations about @entity2 have been discredited before			1
lawyers , police officers and prosecutors had powerful psychological and financial motives not to believe victims who reported @entity2 's attacks			1
for these reasons , acquaintance rape and all other forms of intimate violence are vastly under - reported , under - prosecuted crimes			0
victims need and deserve extra time , and extra respect , when they summon the courage to expose their assaults			0
the stigma of being a rape victim is starting to erode little by little			2
people who were never raped are beginning to internalize that it 's normal to delay reporting rape , it 's normal to have great difficulty confronting an abuser , particularly a powerful celebrity , and it 's normal for a victim to feel shame , reticence and confusion			1
rape and relationship violence experts know that one of the most important factors in recovering from assault is that the first person you tell believes you			0
even if decades - old allegations are surfacing , we need to take them as seriously as if the assaults occurred yesterday			0
let 's hope that the media , corporate leaders and our criminal justice system begin to offer compassion and dignity to women ( and men ) coming forward with allegations of violence and sexual assault			1
let 's try to find ways to end rape on college campuses , in the military , in the @entity161 , in our religious institutions , in our homes and elsewhere .			2
