-- maybe @entity1 approved @entity2 , an @entity4 web browser that plays @entity6 videos , to prove a point : @entity6 is losing relevance			1
despite widespread excitement over the first app to work with @entity13 's plug - in , it turns out that @entity2 is n't very useful			1
my hands - on time with the app , which came out wednesday ( and quickly " sold out , " according to the developer 's press release ) , was an eye - opening experience			1
the app 's primary function is to take websites that use embedded @entity25 and automatically transcode that video into @entity27 so that it 's viewable on the @entity4 , @entity28 or @entity29			1
@entity6 app pulled from @entity1 to test it , i had to find a popular website loaded with flash video			1
i looked at several video - heavy websites , only to realize they were already html5 - ready			2
examples include @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			0
the biggest video websites -- @entity45 and @entity46 -- have moved to @entity27 , too			0
i also found a report showing 54 percent of web video is now @entity27 compatible			0
( note that @entity2 only displays flash video -- not games , animations , ads , etc. ) eventually a @entity54 follower pointed me to a website where @entity2 really came in handy : @entity56			1
when @entity2 detected i was trying to play a @entity6 video , a play button popped up at the bottom of the browser , and the app did its job : within 5 seconds i was streaming an episode of " @entity64			1
" ( @entity65 , i guess			0
) there are some other @entity6 - dependent websites that work well on @entity2 , like the " @entity68 " and " @entity69			1
" but the browser did n't play all @entity6 videos			0
i loaded the @entity73 website , which is a gallery of @entity6 videos , and @entity2 did n't transcode the videos			1
i tried playing a @entity6 video on @entity77 , and @entity2 did n't transcode it , either			1
but it does n't matter so much in those cases , because there are already @entity81 for both @entity73 and @entity77 , which are capable of playing their videos			0
another major exception is @entity84 , whose videos are encoded in @entity6			0
but it 's not @entity2 's fault that you ca n't view @entity84 videos			1
because of licensing terms , the company does n't allow mobile devices to stream @entity84 videos for free , as you could with a computer by visiting @entity84			0
instead , the company wants you to pay a monthly subscription fee through the @entity97 app. if you try visiting @entity84 through @entity2 , you get a message saying it 's not supported			1
frankly i had a tough time finding reasons to use @entity2			2
my hands - on testing of the app made me feel that @entity6 does n't matter anymore ( not nearly as much as it used to before the @entity28 hit stores in april )			2
but @entity2 was a hot seller when it launched wednesday -- so hot that the developers pulled it from the store because of traffic overload , then labeled it " sold out			2
" all this leads me to conclude that the underlying reason is the one big chunk of the web that 's still not available on the @entity4 or @entity28 : free porn			0
indeed , many porn - streaming websites still rely on @entity6			0
that makes me believe that the tipping point for @entity6 to become irrelevant is when the most - popular porn sites shift to @entity27			2
my " research " tells me that day is n't far away			0
in the meantime , @entity2 may have only limited utility for most of the web , but it makes a fine porn browser			2

despite widespread excitement , it turns out that @entity2 is n't very useful
the app 's primary function is to transcode that video so it 's viewable on @entity1 *products*
some flash - dependent sites that work well on @entity2 , are " @entity68 " and " @entity69 "
