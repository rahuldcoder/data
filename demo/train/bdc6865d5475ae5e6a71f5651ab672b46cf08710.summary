-- a @entity2 judge ruled thursday that a woman 's defamation lawsuit against @entity5 can go forward , contending that a jury should make the final decision on several contentious issues critical to the case			1
@entity10 has filed a civil suit against @entity5 , who was acquitted last year of murder and other charges tied to the death of her 2 - year - old daughter @entity5 though she was convicted on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers			1
@entity10 alleges that @entity20 defamed her and damaged her reputation when she claimed that a nanny named @entity23 had taken @entity5 , who was reported missing in july 2008 -- a month after she was last seen			1
the girl 's remains were found in december of that year			0
authorities were never able to find the nanny			0
but they did find @entity10 , the plaintiff in this case , who claimed she never met @entity20 or her daughter			2
@entity20 's civil attorneys have argued that their client never identified the specific woman suing her as the " @entity10 , " the name she gave police			2
in her judgment thursday , circuit judge @entity36 ruled that the critical issue of whether or not @entity20 -- in her statements to police and in a recorded jailhouse conversation with her parents -- fingered @entity10 , the plaintiff , or effectively exonerated her in her daughter 's disappearance " must be decided by a jury			1
" " both parties agree that the defendant did not implicate ( @entity10 ) in the disappearance of the child in the july 16 , 2008 , statements to law enforcement , " @entity36 wrote in her ruling			0
" however , the inferences to be drawn from the july 25 , 2008 , statement ( to her parents ) are disputed matters for jury determination			2
" moreover , @entity10 's assertion that @entity61 's mother @entity5 was " acting as ( an ) agent of " her daughter is likewise " a disputed matter for jury determination			1
" @entity36 's ruling followed a march 23 hearing in @entity68 , @entity2 , in which @entity10 's lawyers called for a " summary judgment " in their client 's favor and @entity20 's defense team argued for the lawsuit to be dismissed			0
the defamation trial is scheduled to begin january 2 , 2013			0
