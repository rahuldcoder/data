-- looks like we 'd all like to live in @entity2			1
fifty years later , we 're still watching " the @entity3			1
" the ' 60s hit continues to air twice a day in @entity5 's weekday schedule , at noon and 12:30 p.m. et. ( @entity5 also has a july 4 marathon , wednesday 8 a.m. -1 p.m. et / @entity7 ; and a weekend tribute to its recently deceased star july 7 - 8 , saturday - sunday 11 a.m. -8 p.m. et / pt. ) @entity3 created a mighty special place in his small - town tv comedy , which seems to have aired continually every day someplace since it left the @entity14 network in 1968			1
when the show ceased production , it ranked as prime - time 's no. 1 series , after spending all eight of its network seasons in @entity24 's @entity23			1
@entity2 was a town so comfortable and calm that @entity3 's down - home sheriff @entity27 hardly ever got to do any sheriff - ing. he mostly dispensed folksy wisdom to his motherless son , @entity30 , rode herd on his jittery sheriff , @entity32 , and helped his @entity2 townsfolk keep on the straight and narrow and neighborly			1
what we love about @entity3 wait			1
this was @entity39 's no. 1 series -- in 1968 ? has n't the @entity41 era - 1968 gone down in history as the year synonymous with social upheaval ? presidential candidate @entity46 and civil rights icon @entity44 were assassinated			1
the " generation gap " widened			0
hippies turned on and dropped out			0
fists were raised at the @entity50			0
and folksy @entity3 drew viewers in staggering numbers			1
perhaps it 's really not so strange at all			0
who would n't rather live in the serene @entity2 of " tv land " than in @entity58 , beset by crime , corruption , war , taxes and societal chaos ? no wonder " the @entity3 " endures , far beyond the nostalgia for more " pivotal " tv landmarks such as " @entity67 " and " @entity68			1
" there 's even a " real " @entity2 , and it continues to draw vacationers			1
@entity3 's hometown of @entity73 , @entity74 , to this day operates the seven - days - a - week @entity75 , filled with the actor 's memorabilia , props , video and other attractions			1
( be there for september 27 - 30 's annual @entity82 ! ) come sit a spell , take your shoes off , y'all come back now , y'hear ? ok , so we borrowed that last line from " @entity89 " theme song			0
in fact , during " @entity3 's " run of 1960 - 68 , " hillbillies " was twice the nation 's top - ranked show			1
the other years ' @entity24 titles went to " @entity98 , " to " @entity99 , " and ( three times ) to " bonanza			0
" which just goes to show how much @entity103 wanted to be anywhere rather than @entity105			2
those other top series still run on tv , but " the @entity3 " has turned out to be in a class by itself			1
did citizens ever really live in idyllic small towns like @entity2 ? maybe we wish we did			2
maybe we still want to			0
what was @entity115 's fictional @entity114 , the small - town setting for that 21st - century @entity118 fave " @entity119 , " but a more elegantly and literately constructed @entity2 ? everybody knew everybody , and got along , and meant well , and everybody was witty and sophisticated			2
' @entity3 ' theme song also part of @entity125 but @entity103 still seem to crave the more primitive version of @entity125 , as evidenced by the fact that everybody 's favorite episodes of " the @entity3 " are the ones in black - and - white			1
the show was filmed monochrome its first five seasons , the ones with @entity135 as @entity32			0
then when @entity135 left the cast for the big screen ( " @entity138 , " anyone ? ) , the show transitioned to color and lost much of its charm			0
we liked @entity2 more as a timeless everyplace than a @entity145 wannabe			2
here 's another reason " the @entity3 " endures : it may be tv 's first dramedy			2
there 's a laugh track , yes , because it was filmed single - camera , rather than in a studio like most other @entity154 - produced series after studio pioneer " @entity156			0
" @entity3 insisted he wanted to be able to include exterior shots , remembering what the outdoors meant to him as a @entity74 kid			2
indeed , what 's the first image of the show that comes to mind ? the whistling - theme opening credits , when @entity3 and son @entity30 are heading out to do some fishin ' ( no " g " here )			2
the " drama " quotient amped up , too , as @entity3 's initial portrayal of sheriff @entity27 as a country bumpkin ( watch the series ' backdoor pilot as a 1960 episode of " @entity174 " ) quickly evolved into the town sage -- a dispenser of common - sense wisdom to the quirky characters who crossed his path in search of rational justice and cogent advice			2
@entity135 won the @entity184 as wacky deputy @entity32			0
@entity3 gained legend as the straight man who made it all possible			0
think of @entity3 this way : can you imagine a 300 - channel tv universe without " the @entity3 " airing someplace every day ? enough said			0
we all need our little slice of @entity2			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

@entity195 notes " the @entity3 " was no. 1 in 1968
in an era of upheaval , @entity103 turned to @entity2 , she says
who would n't choose @entity2 over crime , war and societal chaos ? she says
