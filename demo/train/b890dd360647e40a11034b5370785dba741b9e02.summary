@entity0 emerged victorious in " @entity1 , " and it was @entity3 who defeated her evil stepmother in both film adaptations she starred in this year			1
even @entity7 , the formerly weak and needy protagonist of the " @entity8 , " was confident and fearless in the franchise 's final installment			2
this year 's influx of big screen heroines appears to be a leap toward equality , prompting praise from film critics such as @entity17 of the @entity18			1
off screen , however , things were a little more complicated			1
" @entity22 " actress @entity21 has garnered praise for her turn as @entity25 , the @entity26 agent -- aka " the girl " -- who led the hunt for @entity30			2
meanwhile , @entity32 's success as the film 's director comes saddled with commentary that she , as @entity36 pointed out via @entity37 , is " a very hot woman			2
" " @entity32 would be considered a mildly interesting filmmaker if she was a man , " the author posted this month			2
he has since apologized for the tweet , noting @entity32 's " the @entity44 " " felt like it was directed by a man			2
its testosterone level was palpable , whereas in @entity49 's work you 're aware of a much softer presence behind the camera			2
" in the world of animation , while " @entity55 's " heroine @entity53 trounced her suitors in an archery competition for her hand , @entity52 replaced @entity61 as the film 's director			0
( @entity63 and @entity61 now share the directing credit			0
) the ousted director opened up about her experience as a woman attempting to infiltrate the " @entity68 " with the @entity18 in august , writing , " this was a story that i created , which came from a very personal place , as a woman and a mother			2
to have it taken away and given to someone else , and a man at that , was truly distressing on so many levels			0
" despite accounts of inequality , 2012 has been dubbed the year of the woman , and with good reason , given the many strong female characters and women breaking through in the entertainment industry as well as our culture at large			1
not only will a record 20 women hold @entity89 seats next year , but women voters also greatly influenced the 2012 election , making an impact in swing states such as @entity94			1
as founder of reelgirl.com @entity97 says , @entity95 needs to catch up			1
the sheer increase of strong female characters is n't enough , @entity97 said , noting that role models such as " @entity102 ( voiced by @entity103 ) are often secondary characters			0
" it 's important for the female to be the star of the movie , " the mom of three girls said			0
" ' @entity110 ' has @entity111 , but her role is to help @entity110 on his quest			0
... you can be the first lady , but you ca n't be the president			0
... if you ca n't imagine it , you ca n't be it			0
" @entity95 overachievers @entity118 and @entity120 have enjoyed success this year ; both women created tv shows -- " the @entity124 " and " girls , " respectively -- in which they also star			1
embodying versions of the everywoman , their characters @entity124 and @entity128 do n't ignore their curves , a simple but subversive statement in image - conscious @entity95			1
before " girls " debuted on @entity135 in april , @entity120 told @entity136 , " i do n't look like everybody that you usually see on television			1
i wanted to make sure to cast actresses who were beautiful , but beautiful the way that your sexiest friend is beautiful , not beautiful the way that someone who is on a @entity148 show is beautiful			2
" @entity120 is undeniably an up - and - coming 20 - something powerhouse , but instead of her merits , public focus was placed on her body and the lack of racial diversity on her show			1
when she was criticized for alleged nepotism , she shot back , telling @entity158 's @entity157 , " i really did want to challenge all the people crying nepotism to actually tell me who either of my parents were , because it 's the contemporary art world			0
" @entity164 continued when reports surfaced in october that @entity120 signed a book deal with @entity167 for $ 3.7 million			1
sure , that 's a good chunk of change in exchange for tales of poetry camp and vegan dinner parties , but it 's no more outrageous than the deals offered to her a-list counterparts			0
@entity120 also came under fire for the things her " girls " character did between the sheets			1
noting the sometimes disquieting -- but realistic -- sex scenes , columnist @entity187 wrote , " you watch these scenes and other examples of the zeitgeist - y , early - 20s heroines of ' girls ' engaging in , recoiling from , mulling and mourning sex , and you think : @entity192 went to the barricades for this ? " and while @entity196 starred as two different empowered heroines , in the real world , her " indiscretion " with " @entity204 " director @entity195 had the public branding her with a scarlet " @entity200 " in some of the coverage , @entity195 was portrayed as a victim in the scandal , while @entity207 was called a " trampire			1
" back on the big screen , @entity207 's @entity3 character was berated for being too masculine by critics such as @entity211			1
" i know it 's a fairy tale , but since when was @entity3 a she - man warrior ? " @entity211 wrote on her website in june			2
" uh , sorry , but reality check : men are the strong ones and the ones in physical fighting who win and best women			0
" around the same time , @entity195 explained @entity207 's tough @entity3 character to @entity223 , saying , " i love to play against expectations			0
... i made a decision not to have @entity196 do anything that she would n't realistically be able to do			1
no @entity227 or ' @entity229 ' moves			0
she is not on a killing rampage			0
the men follow her into battle because of the spirit within her			0
" in 2006 , while accepting an award from @entity236 ( an organization promoting the human rights of women ) , @entity240 ( " @entity241 , " " @entity242 " ) said he 's often asked why he creates such strong women characters			0
his response : " why are n't you asking 100 other guys why they do n't write strong women characters ? " now , more women are entering the conversation themselves such as @entity251 and @entity252 , who wrote last year 's hit " bridesmaids " starring an all - female ensemble cast			1
strong female characters are also becoming more prevalent			0
there 's the @entity148 's new @entity259 drama , " @entity261 , " which will have a female lead , according to @entity262 , and @entity263 and @entity265 's buddy comedy , " @entity267 , " which is expected to hit theaters in april			0
in january , @entity268 and @entity269 will co-host the 70th annual @entity270 ( the first time any woman -- let alone two -- will helm the event without a male co-host ) , proving that the so - called " year " of the woman shows no signs of slowing down .			1
