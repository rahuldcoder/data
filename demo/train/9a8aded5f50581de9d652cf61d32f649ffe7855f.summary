@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 judge thursday declined to grant former dictator @entity4 amnesty from genocide charges , paving the way for a trial			1
@entity4 's defense team had filed a motion seeking amnesty last week			1
the judge argued that the country 's 1996 @entity11 , which coincided with the end of the country 's civil war , does not guarantee amnesty for those accused of human rights abuses			2
secondly , the judge said , @entity1 is party to international treaties that obligate it to prosecute crimes of genocide			0
@entity4 ruled @entity1 from 1982 to 1983			1
he came to power in a coup and led a military junta while @entity1 was in a bloody civil war between the army and leftist guerrillas			0
the war did not end until 1996 , leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees			0
prosecutors argued that @entity4 was aware of the repressive strategies that the military was using against anyone suspected of being a guerrilla , such as killings , forced disappearances and kidnappings , the state - run @entity33 news agency reported			2
the human rights abuse and genocide allegations against him come from his " scorched earth " campaign to root out insurgents in provinces heavily populated by indigenous populations			1
he is accused of being responsible for the deaths of more than 1,700 @entity53 residents			0
during his rule , there were massacres in these provinces in which , according to the @entity1 truth commission , between 70 % and 90 % of some villages were razed			1
the commission found that during this and other periods of the civil war , there were also reported cases of rape , especially of @entity53 women			0
journalist @entity66 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 will face a genocide trial as *planned*
