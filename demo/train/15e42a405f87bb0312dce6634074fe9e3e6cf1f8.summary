@entity0 -- @entity5 has still not come to terms with the " hurt and anger " many felt as a result of @entity10 's policies more than two decades ago , a senior clergyman who will greet mourners at her funeral has said			1
in the week since @entity5 's first woman prime minister died , protests have been organized in @entity0 and elsewhere by activists who blame her for creating wide unemployment as she privatized industries and took on the unions			2
" you have to ask the question -- why is it , 23 years after she left government , that mrs. @entity10 is still such a controversial figure ? " the very rev. @entity20 , the dean of @entity21 , said to @entity1			1
" and i think part of that is we still have n't come to terms with the hurt and the anger that many parts of society have felt because of the legacy of her government policies			1
" that hurt is being revived by the austerity policies brought in by the current government to try to tackle the deficit , he said			1
" there is some real work to be done here about what 's the relationship between the rich and the poor in our society , and how we can work together instead of being opposed to one another , " he said			1
" that 's a particular agenda that i think that this funeral will be throwing up and highlighting			2
" @entity10 's funeral will be held at @entity21 on wednesday morning , attended by more than 2,000 guests			1
they will include @entity55 , accompanied by @entity56 , as well as @entity5 prime minister @entity57 and dozens more dignitaries from @entity5 and overseas			0
@entity10 herself approved the elements of the service , @entity20 said			1
" it 's a relatively simple and straightforward service ; she was a @entity65 by upbringing so no pomp and circumstance -- there 's no tribute , there 's no eulogy to her , there 's very little in the service about her at all , " he said			0
" it 's a simple service for praying for her and for the family around her			0
" the @entity78 , the right rev. @entity79 , will give the address at the funeral , in which he will reflect on her death and her legacy , both as an individual and for wider society			2
@entity20 's role will be to welcome the queen and other guests at the cathedral doors and to bid the congregation farewell at the end of the service			2
@entity10 death ' party ' @entity10 was prime minister from 1979 to 1990 , having led the @entity96 since 1974			0
tributes to her achievements poured in from around the globe , as well as from many in @entity5 , after the news of her death on april 8 from a stroke , aged 87			0
a towering figure in postwar @entity5 and global politics , @entity10 is remembered in the world for her @entity108 - era friendships with @entity111 president @entity110 and @entity113 leader @entity112 , as well as her role in shaping @entity5 's place in @entity116 and the short , sharp war she waged with @entity119 over the disputed @entity120			1
but a strong current of @entity123 feeling has also been in evidence in @entity5			2
at @entity127 in central @entity0 on saturday , activists and former miners held a " party " to celebrate her death , rallying around an effigy of @entity10 , whose orange hair was made out of plastic bags			0
the effigy was paraded around the square , which in 1990 was the scene of rioting against a hugely unpopular " poll tax " introduced by @entity10			0
protesters chanted " @entity139 , @entity139 , @entity139 , dead , dead , dead			0
" workers also unfurled a " @entity142 " banner , evoking memories of the painful yearlong coal miners ' strike during the @entity10 years			0
in another indication of how divisive her legacy remains , a @entity150 campaign to encourage people to buy the " @entity154 " song " @entity153 ! the witch is dead " in celebration of @entity10 's death sent sales skyrocketing			1
the song reached no. 2 on the official national charts sunday			0
