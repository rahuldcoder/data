@entity2 rancher @entity1 's remarks about whether " the @entity4 " fared better under slavery represents the latest in a series of incendiary racial comments from a new crop of folk heroes embraced in some conservative circles			1
" they abort their young children , they put their young men in jail , because they never learned how to pick cotton , " @entity1 said to reporters , according to the @entity11			1
" and i 've often wondered , are they better off as slaves , picking cotton and having a family life and doing things , or are they better off under government subsidy ? they did n't get no more freedom			2
they got less freedom , " he was quoted as saying			0
@entity1 , 67 , a rancher whose much - publicized land dispute with the federal government endeared him to conservatives , defended his comments as idle thoughts			1
" in my mind i 'm wondering , are they better off being slaves , in that sense , or better off being slaves to the @entity41 government , in the sense of the subsidies ? i 'm wondering			1
and the statement was right			0
i am wondering , " he said thursday on " the @entity47			0
" @entity1 stood by those comments in interviews with @entity50 on thursday and friday			1
that defense included a tense exchange friday morning with " @entity54 " anchor @entity53			0
" maybe i sinned ... and maybe i do n't know what i actually said			0
... if i say @entity4 or black or slave ... if those people can not take those kind of words and not be ( offended ) , then @entity56 has n't got his job done yet			0
... we need to get over this prejudice stuff , " @entity1 said			1
" i do n't think i 'm wrong , " he also told @entity50 's @entity64 on thursday night			2
" i think i 'm right			0
" but politicians such as sen. @entity66 of @entity67 , a potential 2016 presidential @entity69 contender , @entity70 sen. @entity70 of @entity2 and other conservatives scrambled to distance themselves from the controversy			2
" his remarks on race are offensive and i wholeheartedly disagree with him , " @entity66 said in a statement			2
@entity70 " completely disagrees with mr. @entity1 's appalling and racist statements , and condemns them in the most strenuous way , " according to his spokesman , @entity79			1
the @entity80 said @entity1 's comments were " completely beyond the pale			1
both highly offensive and 100 % wrong on race			2
" but experts on race and politics say the comments , much like those of rocker @entity89 , who created a firestorm when he called president @entity91 a " subhuman mongrel , " also speak to complicated and deeply fraught cultural tensions running beneath the surface in some segments of @entity41			1
" we are looking at some of the ' last white men standing , ' " @entity96 , an african - american studies professor at @entity97 , said of demographic shifts that show minorities now represent more than half of the nation 's population born in 2010 and 2011 , according to the most recent census data			2
" his comments represent that , and people rally around him because of this idea that white men are under siege			2
they are calling out the political establishment to stand by them , " he said			0
over the next several generations , political experts say minority voters will become more of a power base in the @entity119 , the @entity120 and in @entity121			0
during the 2012 presidential election , republicans faced huge losses among minorities and women , prompting the @entity69 to re-examine outreach to those groups			0
but @entity1 's comments -- much like those of @entity89 and " @entity133 " star @entity134 , who shared during an interview with @entity132 last year pastoral recollections of blacks " singing and happy " as he and his family worked alongside them in @entity139 cotton fields -- speak to a certain politically active fringe element , political experts say			1
among those who support views of limited government , there is often a " higher than average endorsement of views that could be seen as racial resentment , " said @entity145 , an associate professor of political science at @entity147			0
" what this reflects is that there are groups of people who have not been accepted by politically correct circles and have never learned to frame their comments in a palatable fashion			0
they take pride in that , " @entity145 said			0
" the articulation of their views is somewhat fringe , but the underlying attitude is not			0
they are a minority viewpoint , but they are a large minority			0
" and that 's put politicians who have previously embraced men such as @entity1 , @entity89 and @entity134 as cause célèbres in an awkward position			1
for instance , @entity176 attorney general @entity175 , his state 's @entity69 nominee for governor , took heat from some quarters when @entity89 appeared at a campaign event for him this year			1
@entity175 's campaign said it did not endorse @entity89 's comments			1
other republicans viewed as potential presidential candidates , including sen. @entity187 of @entity176 and the state 's governor , @entity188 , also distanced themselves from @entity89 's remarks			1
@entity66 said an apology was in order , which @entity89 eventually offered for using the term			2
conservative radio host @entity194 said on his show that he worries @entity197 will now use @entity1 's " repugnant " and " despicable " comments to paint everyone on the far right as racists			1
the @entity201 pounced on @entity1 's remarks			1
" if you ever want to be taken seriously for your outreach efforts , you might want to start by not defending racists , " @entity201 spokesman @entity203 said in a statement			0
opinion : conservative hero is racist rancher ? did n't see that one coming			0

politicians back away from @entity1 's comments on blacks , *welfare* and slaves
@entity1 , @entity89 and @entity134 have all echoed *similarly* *insensitive* sentiments
experts on race and politics say such comments speak to an active fringe element in @entity41
politicians must tread *carefully* , experts say , in embracing such cause célèbres
