@entity0 -- when president @entity3 signed the @entity4 into law , it was clear he would face an uphill battle defending the law and communicating its benefits to the @entity10 public			1
in the months leading to passage , we heard cries of rationing , death panels and blatant mischaracterization of what is in the bill			0
since passage , the cries have shifted from rationing to repeal			2
efforts to repeal the law have been highlighted by the self - proclaimed " @entity24 " of the @entity25 -- @entity27 minority whip @entity26 of @entity28 , rep. @entity29 of @entity30 and rep. @entity31 of @entity32			1
president @entity3 should not be fazed by this or any other calls for repeal			2
he should do the job he was elected to do and protect patients ' interests , but he will need to face a confused public			1
in a recent national survey conducted by the @entity42 , only 14 percent of respondents correctly identified september as the starting month for the law 's first set of patient protections			1
less than half understood that health reform would allow for them to receive preventive care services without having to pay anything			1
even fewer could specifically identify other important provisions that started on or after september 23 , 2010			0
moreover , a recent @entity54 poll found that a quarter of @entity10 believe incorrectly that the law designated a panel of government bureaucrats to make decisions about health care for individuals			1
the confusion and apathy surrounding the health care reform law leaves ample opportunity for others to mischaracterize and foster doubt , energizing and exciting the repeal platform			1
the unwavering confidence of dissenters is stronger than a mere promise of good			0
but health care reform will not be repealed , and despite messy politics and angry voices , policymakers , providers , insurance companies and other stakeholders are moving quickly to implement the bill			1
to override a presidential veto would require a two - thirds majority in the @entity27 and in the @entity82			0
but even according to the @entity25 's most optimistic forecasts , @entity25 can not expect to achieve a supermajority in both chambers in november			0
republicans may expect to block funds or repeal small parts of the bill			1
but even that is n't as simple as it sounds			2
last week , the @entity82 voted on two amendments regarding the 1099 provision in the @entity4 introduced by two senators , one by sen. @entity95 , a @entity25 from @entity96 , and another by sen. @entity97 , a @entity98 from @entity99			0
the 1099 provision requires that businesses report all purchases from vendors over $ 600 , creating a significant burden on small businesses			0
the @entity25 wanted to repeal the provision ; @entity107 wanted to change it			2
neither amendment was able to muster enough support			0
but more importantly , a repeal of health care reform , followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes , is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall , with no net to catch them			1
as a physician , i see the consequences of uninsurance and a broken health care system every day			1
frustrated patients , crowded emergency rooms and burdensome insurance requirements are driving good physicians into other professions and making patients feel hopeless			1
our system was not working , and we can not afford to quietly stand by while one in seven lack access to basic care and one in six people live in poverty			1
it would be unfortunate if our country kept listening to ideological shouting and failed to understand the value of the important provisions in the law			2
health reform starts at birth -- health plans will no longer be able to refuse to cover children younger than 19 simply because they were born with a medical condition			1
from birth through your 26th birthday , you can stay on your family 's health insurance plan , regardless of your income or marital status			2
for female readers of childbearing age , you no longer need a referral to see an @entity161 doctor			0
from there , adults and seniors will no longer have cost - sharing provisions for preventive services			0
and what is a preventive service exactly ? there are at least 45 services that will be covered , including everything from nutrition counseling to cancer screening			0
last but not least are the elimination of lifetime caps and the gradual elimination of annual coverage limits			2
together this all adds up to more patient protections than we have ever had , and this is just the beginning			0
keep in mind that some of these provisions will not technically kick in until your health plan starts the new plan year , which usually happens in january			0
but do not wait until then to get your information ; search your plan 's website and talk to your employer 's human resource department or benefits manager			0
the real verdict on health reform will likely come in 2014 when an expected 32 million people will be added to insurance exchanges , state medicaid programs and other private insurance plans			1
the pathway from here to there is long and filled with many speed bumps , but information , transparency and advocacy are our best friends			0
as patients , we should ask questions and not be afraid to challenge our health care system , insurance companies and government officials when we are left feeling confused or misguided			1
as medical providers , we must not compromise our responsibility to first do no harm			0
we should begin by asking our patients what they do and do n't understand and by helping them navigate these uncharted waters together			2
as @entity10 we need to send a strong signal to @entity25 and @entity107 leaders that repeal and replace is not an option			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2

republicans are *pledging* to repeal the health care reform law
former @entity232 aid @entity226 says public is n't aware of key benefits of law
she says the law provides more *consumer* protections than patients have ever had
@entity226 : law will provide insurance coverage for 32 million more people in 2014
