-- as a teenager , @entity2 's eyesight began to fail			1
doctors told him there was nothing they could do to save his vision and over the years his sight deteriorated until , by the age of 40 , he was completely blind			1
@entity2 had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa , a hereditary eye disease that damages the retina -- a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that converts light to nerve signals and sends them to the brain			1
but he always believed that one day he would see again			0
a few years ago he heard about a device called the @entity25 known as the " bionic eye , " it gave a glimmer of hope that some of his sight might be restored			1
" at that time it was all experimental , " recalls @entity2 , " so i just kept waiting and kept waiting and thought someday it would happen , because you have to believe in yourself			1
" the @entity25 system consists of a pair of glasses with a small video camera mounted on it , which captures images			1
a prosthesis no larger than a pencil eraser is surgically implanted on the surface of the retina and information from the camera is transmitted wirelessly to electrodes on the artificial retina , where it is converted to electrical pulses			1
any remaining cells that have n't been damaged by the eye disease are stimulated by the pulses , leading to a perception of light patterns in the brain			0
it 's a long way from perfect vision -- the users perceives simple flashes of light , no color or details -- but it can be enough to get around			1
the @entity25 has been used in @entity64 since 2011 in countries including @entity66 and @entity67 , but @entity2 lives in @entity68 , and the device was n't approved by the @entity70 until last year			1
on january 22 , 2014 @entity2 became the second person in the @entity72 to get the implant			1
the surgery itself lasted around four hours but the recovery took a few weeks			0
when doctors at the @entity80 , at the @entity78 , finally activated the chip , they warned @entity2 that he might not see anything right away , but in fact the effects were immediate			2
he remembers : " they turned it back on and i 'm sitting there and i 'm thinking : there was a light flashing on the screen was n't there ? and they said , ' yeah			0
' " i looked up and i said ' there 's a light up there , ' and i turned around and the three lights in the room , i pointed right at them			2
" the surgery was a success			0
it appeared @entity2 would regain some vision with the help of the glasses and the implant , but it would n't be easy			1
after years of not processing visual information , it was n't just @entity2 's eyes that had to learn how to see again			1
" you have to go through the process , kind of like learning a new language , " says @entity109 , genetic counselor at @entity111			0
" you have to retrain your brain to see and understand those images that it 's seeing			2
" so every week , @entity2 and his wife drive to @entity119 for rehab , three hours there , and three hours back			2
" they start out in the beginning really just teaching them what they 're seeing , " says @entity109			0
" so , how do they understand what they 're seeing ? what 's the difference when they see the lights and when they do n't see the lights ? how to interpret what a shadow is , what 's a light ? then learn about interpreting lines and things like that			2
" although seeing pulses of light may not sound like much , for @entity2 it 's so much more than he had before the procedure			1
" it 's been pretty awesome , " he says			1
" i can tell when my grandson runs around the house , i can tell when people step in front of me , i can tell when my wife had on a white top versus dark bottoms , vice versa			0
i could follow my mom around on @entity156 ; she had a light top on			0
every day it 's something small but something different			0
" there have been four such surgeries performed at @entity80 this year -- one of only two clinics in the @entity72 currently doing the procedure , although 10 more are working to add the operation			2
the @entity167 notes that surgery like this does come with " potential complications " and this procedure still is n't available to the " mass public			0
" but it also notes that for " someone who has no vision this is an outstanding breakthrough , " even if the vision is still only " rudimentary			0
" with the progress of patients like @entity2 , there is growing hope for the " bionic eye , " and for a second chance at sight			2
" i told my wife for years , ' i do n't know when , what , or how , but i will see again , " says @entity2			2
" you got to believe in yourself -- i always have			0
someday , yes , i will see again			0
i did n't know how , where , when -- but it 's happening now			0

an artificial retina is restoring *partial* vision in blind people
the @entity25 *collects* visual information using a video camera on a pair of glasses
@entity2 is only the second person to get the implant in the @entity72
" it 's been pretty awesome , " he says
