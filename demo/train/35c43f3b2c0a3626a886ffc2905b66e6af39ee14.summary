-- everyone has tough days at the office , but when @entity4 has one it goes viral			1
the rapper has been picked apart online after he tweeted his feelings about his profile in @entity9 magazine			1
the magazine 's cover features the late @entity12 , who was found dead at age 46 on february 2 from an apparent drug overdose			1
according to @entity4 's tweeted comments -- some of which he later deleted -- not only was he supposed to have the @entity9 cover , but the publication printed a quote that he called incorrect			1
" i never commented on ( @entity21 's ) ' @entity20 ' for my interview portion of @entity9 , " @entity4 initially posted on thursday			1
" they also took my cover from me last minute and ran the issue			2
i 'm disgusted with that			2
but the press is evil			2
i 'm done doing interviews for magazines			0
i just want to give my music to the people			0
that 's the only way my message gets across accurately			0
" actually , it 's not the only way			0
by the early morning hours of friday , @entity4 turned to his website to give more clarity on his rage against @entity9 , and to apologize to the @entity12 family and those who were offended by his comments			1
" these days are the worst ones , " @entity4 said in a lengthy statement			1
" after dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time			0
so here i am having that moment			0
" thursday , which also happened to be the fifth anniversary of his landmark " @entity53 " mixtape , was " an extremely emotional day , " @entity4 explained			2
" i completely support and agree with @entity9 replacing me on the cover with the legendary @entity12			1
he is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication			0
my frustration stemmed from the way it was executed			0
the circumstances at hand are completely justifiable ( on the magazine 's behalf ) , but i was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating			0
" @entity4 goes on to say that the issue was printed without him having the option to be in it or not , and that , had he been able to , he would 've " waited until it was my time because i understand the magnitude of the cover they chose			1
but i just was n't given that option and that made me feel violated			2
" in the end , the 27 - year - old said he wanted to apologize " to anybody who took my initial comments out of context , because in no way would i ever want to offend the @entity12 family or see myself as bigger than that moment			2
i am still the same person			0
... i respect @entity9 for being willing to give a kid from @entity87 a shot at the cover			1
i guess this is a day to learn and grow			0
