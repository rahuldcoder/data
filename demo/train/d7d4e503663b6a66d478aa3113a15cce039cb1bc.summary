@entity0 , @entity1 -- a claim that several dozen glass plates bought for $ 45 at a garage sale were negatives from @entity7 brought an angry response of disbelief from the man who oversees the famed photographer 's trust			1
@entity7 ' grandson is also unconvinced			1
@entity14 , who runs the @entity7 , said even if they are authenticated , they are not worth much beyond their historical value			1
the art dealer who placed their eventual value at more than $ 200 million said wednesday that the controversy is increasing their value by " driving the market to them			2
" " they 're making them so desirable , " said @entity27			0
" people all over the world are seeing this and saying ' i want one of each			0
' " that controversy took a bitter turn a day after @entity1 wall painter @entity38 and his lawyer held a news conference at @entity43 ' @entity42 art gallery to say they have proof the negatives were created by @entity7			1
@entity47 , the managing trustee of @entity7 ' trust , called @entity38 and those working with him " a bunch of crooks " who " are pulling a big con job			1
" @entity38 's lawyer , @entity54 , called @entity47 's attack " a shameful and pointless disparagement of the professional reputations of some of the top leaders in their respective fields			1
" the team of experts included two court - qualified handwriting experts , a retired @entity66 agent , and a former assistant @entity68 attorney , @entity54 said			0
@entity54 said that based on the overwhelming evidence they gathered " no reasonable person would have any doubt that these , in fact , were the long - lost images of @entity7			1
" @entity47 , who was @entity7 ' business manager before his death in 1984 , challenged the expertise of @entity38 's team , saying the only one with art credentials was a " so - called expert that nobody has ever heard of from @entity81 , @entity82			1
" " they had to go out into the boonies to dig him up , " @entity47 said			0
@entity38 's lawyer responded by calling @entity47 an " elitist			1
" " @entity7 would likely be shocked and appalled at such blatant arrogance and condescending commentary in his name , " @entity54 said			1
@entity47 said @entity38 's strategy is to line up a long list of hired experts to tell " a big lie			2
" " @entity94 used that technique , " @entity47 said			0
" you do n't tell a small one			0
you tell a big one			0
" @entity54 said @entity47 " has converted a professional disagreement over works of art into a personal attack utilizing tactics that are grossly offensive and unconscionable			0
" " likening @entity38 to @entity94 is nothing more than yet another bullying tactics designed to silence mr. @entity38 , " @entity54 said			0
the lawyer invited @entity14 and @entity47 " to engage in a meaningful dialogue and examine the evidence which they have consistently refused to do			2
" " we now offer them yet another opportunity to jointly agree on and hire experts who are qualified to render a final opinion on the authenticity of the negatives , " @entity54 said			0
" any honest and fair assessment will lead to but one conclusion -- these are the lost negatives of @entity7			1
" the approach was " to put these negatives on trial " using a " high burden of proof " to show that the 65 glass plates were created by @entity7 , the iconic @entity68 photographer whose images of the @entity126 inspired the country			1
" i have sent people to prison for the rest of their lives for far less evidence than i have seen in this case , " said evidence and burden - of - proof expert @entity131 , who was hired by @entity38 to help authenticate the plates			0
" in my view , those photographs were done by @entity7			1
" meanwhile , @entity14 said wednesday , " i do n't think that they 've proven that they are ( authentic )			0
... and i do n't know that you could ever prove that they are			0
" @entity7 , who reviewed @entity38 's evidence last year , said he wanted more scientific tests , including carbon dating , to prove beyond a doubt that the work was that of his grandfather			1
he cited " a number of inconsistencies , " including the conclusion by two handwriting analysts that notations on manila envelopes containing the plates were made by @entity7 ' wife , @entity158			1
the envelopes had five misspellings of well - known @entity162 landmarks , he said			0
" @entity165 " is misspelled twice as " @entity163 " and " @entity164 " is misspelled " @entity166 , " @entity7 said			1
@entity158 -- who spent most of her life in that area of @entity1 -- would have spelled those names correctly , he said			0
handwriting experts @entity170 and @entity172 said they used @entity158 ' writing samples provided by her grandson to reach their conclusion that it was her penmanship			2
@entity14 said his belief that she was not the author of the notations is based on copies of the envelopes given to him by @entity54			0
" i just looked at them myself , " @entity7 said			1
" i did not hire experts			0
" @entity38 's team also said the locations of the photographs , which were taken around @entity188 and @entity162 , helped prove their case			2
" the fact that these locations were well - known to @entity7 , and visited by him , further supports the proposition that all of the images in the collection were most probably created by @entity7 , " said art expert @entity190			1
@entity14 said that circumstantial evidence was unconvincing , since several other highly skilled photographers were known to shoot at the same places around the same period			0
even if @entity38 's glass plates are authentic @entity7 photographs , they would have mostly historical value , " not anywhere near " the $ 200 million estimate given by @entity43 , @entity7 said			1
streets said his estimate was based on decades of print sales and rights fees			2
" there will always be a demand for @entity7 ' work , " he said			1
" the long - term potential is very easy to prove for these			0
" " you ca n't print original photographs from them because @entity7 's not around to print them , " @entity14 said			1
" anything you make from them you would have to say is an unknown interpretation of something that may be @entity7 's			1
" the @entity7 is still producing prints , but with a printer who was trained by @entity7			1
the iconic artist died in 1984 at the age of 82			0
" a lot of the magic that he created was in the darkroom making the print , " his grandson said			2
" @entity7 's not around to tell us how he would have printed it			1
" streets countered @entity7 , saying , " it 's not a mysterious process			1
" " there are master printmakers who are making prints today , " he said			2
@entity38 has contracted with @entity241 , whose prints hang in the @entity243 and the @entity245 museums , to produce original fine arts prints from the negatives , @entity27 said			2
while @entity14 is unconvinced , he does n't doubt that @entity38 is sincere in his belief that he has @entity7 negatives			1
" i think that they do believe it , but i do n't think that they have proven it , " he said			0
he does n't agree , however , with @entity47 's charge that it 's a " con job			1
" " my take on it is that it is irresponsible to present them as @entity7 's , " @entity14 said			1
@entity38 , a painter for the @entity260 school system , kept the glass plates under his pool table for four years before realizing they might be too valuable to store at home			0
he believes they were from @entity7 ' early career , a period that is not well documented since a 1937 darkroom fire destroyed 5,000 of his plates			1
" it truly is a missing link of @entity7 and history and his career , " @entity27 said			1
@entity38 , who scours garage sales for antiques , was looking for a barber chair when he spotted two deteriorated boxes in the spring of 2000			2
when he pulled one of the glass negatives out , he saw @entity162			0
" as a young man , i worked at @entity162 quite a bit			2
so , right away i recognized it as @entity162 , " @entity38 said			0
he bargained with the seller , finally negotiating the price for the boxes down from $ 70 to $ 45			0
the owner said he bought them in the 1940s at a warehouse salvage sale in @entity0			2
it would be two years before @entity38 realized the photos might be from @entity7 , he said			1
after four years , he had done enough research to realize the plates could be valuable			0
he moved them from under his pool table and placed them in a bank vault			0
how these 6.5 - inch x 8.5 - inch glass plate negatives of famous @entity162 landscapes and @entity188 landmarks -- some of them showing fire damage -- might have made their way from @entity7 ' collection 70 years ago to a @entity1 garage sale in 2000 can only be guessed			1
photography expert @entity304 , who helped confirm the authenticity of the negatives , suspects @entity7 carried them to use in a photography class he was teaching in @entity309 , @entity1 , in the early 1940s			2
" it is my belief that he brought these negatives with him for teaching purposes and to show students how to not let their negatives be engulfed in a fire , " @entity304 said			0
" i think this clearly explains the range of work in these negatives , from very early pictorialist boat pictures , to images not as successful , to images of the highest level of his work during this time period			0
" @entity304 said it is impossible to know why @entity7 would store them in @entity309 and never reclaim them			2
for now , the photos will go on a tour of universities and museums , starting in october at @entity335 , @entity38 said			2
" i just hope everybody enjoys them , " he said			0
@entity38 said he has not spoken with the man who sold him the two boxes a decade ago			2
" if he 's still around , i 'm afraid he may come looking for me , " he said			0
@entity38 , who is 64 , is still working but said he may retire this year .			0
