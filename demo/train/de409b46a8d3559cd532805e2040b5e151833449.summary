holding force of @entity8 rebels and @entity10 troops			0
" [ @entity12 ] his strategy of taking out terrorists ... is one that we have successfully pursued in @entity17 and @entity18 for years , " the president said			1
the reality is that the few victories against @entity21 in @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity22 are not a product of @entity25 air power alone , but a combination of @entity25 boots on the ground , advisers and special forces , and as importantly , years of promoting local governance and military reform			1
absent such security and political initiatives , @entity2 's counterterrorism strategy is destined to fail			1
there are two critical lessons from the experiences in @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity22 for the war against @entity3			1
first , airstrikes without troops on the ground do n't work			0
despite innovations in air power such as advanced targeting , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance capabilities , there is simply no substitute for eyes , ears and feet on the ground			2
with this in mind , the @entity25 has had a presence on the ground in @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity22 even when the missions were strictly counterterrorism			1
at various times in @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity22 , @entity25 troops have directly engaged @entity21 , protected fellow advisers , marked targets for airstrikes , embedded with and transported local troops , and used armed drones , helicopters and gunships			1
and yet even after more than 500 air strikes in @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity22 since 9/11 , @entity25 troops still had to conduct high - profile raids against specific top terrorist leaders			1
@entity25 troops have been deployed to @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity22 to help train local troops , conduct operations and work closely with @entity74 operatives and local proxies			1
so boots on the ground are clearly an essential part of any counterterrorism strategy -- as long as local politicians and generals are willing to share power , promote efficiency and embrace diversity			2
the second lesson for defeating @entity3 is that improving local governance and building pluralistic militaries is difficult , but still the best deterrent against recurring @entity3 radicalism			2
of course , @entity90 can not fix local politics within failing states that are embroiled in decades of conflict made worse by ethnic and religious divisions			0
yet progress in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity22 shows that @entity25 diplomats have , albeit slowly , pushed central governments to become more inclusive and share power with the periphery , and their militaries to embrace ethnic and religious diversity			1
in @entity18 , with the help of @entity104 and @entity105 allies , including the 22,000 well - trained and equipped @entity107 troops , @entity90 has prodded the central government to implement the " @entity109 , " which is focused on promoting national and local reconciliation , facilitating tribal disputes and devolving power to local and regional administrations			2
lack of governance and security is the main source of local grievances that @entity119 frequently exploits			0
in @entity17 , @entity25 diplomats have offered $ 40 million in assistance to encourage president @entity122 to convert the @entity123 into a sustainable peace plan for his fractured country , which will include constitutional reform			1
like @entity18 , @entity17 is in desperate need of a strong plan for disarmament , demobilization and reintegration that devolves power to local districts and places the security forces under the rule of law , guaranteeing religious freedoms			1
in nuclear - armed @entity22 's northern tribal badlands , the situation is more complex but governance deficiencies are similar to @entity18 's south and @entity17 's east			1
the @entity25 has given billions to improve local infrastructure and supported democracy			0
most of the $ 4.4 billion in aid to @entity22 between 2010 and 2014 is conditioned on strengthening @entity22 democracy			0
the passage of the 18th amendment to the @entity22 constitution was a small but encouraging effort to transfer power from the center to the provinces			0
moreover , in the most recent protests in @entity156 the @entity22 military has restrained from directly intervening			0
besides helping improve local governance , the @entity25 has spent years training and equipping @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity22 militaries , subtly encouraging ethnic diversity			1
in @entity22 , for example , @entity25 trainers helped transform a ragtag @entity163 , commanded by @entity165 outsiders , into a counterinsurgency force that has several units commanded by @entity168			0
of course , not all investments have paid off			0
tribal and religious divisions continue to threaten the @entity18 and @entity17 armies , while the @entity22 military and intelligence services are widely seen as sympathetic to the @entity175 @entity174 , although troops have finally put pressure on militants in @entity180 territory			2
so what does all this say about how to tackle @entity3 ? true , the group trumps @entity21 and affiliates across the greater @entity185 in terms of finances , numbers and territorial control			0
but it can be defeated			0
president @entity2 's push for more representative @entity10 government and improved vetting of @entity8 rebels are steps in the right direction			1
but realistically the @entity25 should be expecting to send some 4,000 to 6,000 additional @entity25 service members to help gather intelligence , train @entity8 rebels , revive the @entity198 , build a national guard , protect advisers , mark targets and conduct raids against high - profile targets			2
this can not be realistically be done without @entity25 troops -- and will likely take about two years			0
meanwhile , @entity25 diplomats should be pushing for better @entity10 governance , including ensuring all major ethnic and religious groups are represented in the @entity10 and @entity8 security forces			2
defeating a foe like @entity3 wo n't be easy , and it will require political courage from the @entity25 to follow through			2
but a multi-pronged commitment is absolutely necessary			0
this is one conflict that can not be won from the air .			0

president @entity2 's strategy for destroying @entity3 seems to rely on air strikes , writes @entity219
@entity2 says strategy has been successful in @entity17 and @entity18
@entity219 says in both countries , some kind of presence was needed on the ground
@entity25 also needs to focus on improving governance for long - term security , @entity219 says
