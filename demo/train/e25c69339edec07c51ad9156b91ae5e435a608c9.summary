-- what is it about @entity3 and guns ? how much time do you have ? " i can tell you that i do n't think there 's any other developed country in the world that has remotely the problem we have , " @entity8 mayor @entity7 said after the shooting rampage in @entity10			1
there are an estimated 270 million guns in the hands of civilians in the @entity3 , making @entity3 the most heavily armed people in the world per capita			1
@entity23 , a tribal nation with no history of strong central government or the rule of law , comes in a distant second			1
from @entity29 to the well - stocked shelves of @entity32 stores nationwide , guns are regarded in the @entity3 as a commonplace if controversial consumer item for millions of law - abiding hunters , collectors and citizens concerned about their safety			1
they are also in the hands of thousands of killers too ; a @entity29 - based anti-gun lobby says those guns shoot more than 100,000 people a year			2
in 2010 , there were more than 30,000 deaths caused by firearms when the number of homicides , suicides and accidental deaths are tallied			0
@entity3 's collective memory -- of the @entity57 in the 1800s , the assassinations of @entity53 and @entity54 half a century ago and the front - page news from last week -- is marked time and time again by guns			1
" it 's undeniable , " writes @entity62 , author of " @entity63 : the @entity64 as @entity3 as @entity65			2
" " guns are at the center of much of @entity3 's history , its legends , and its horrors			1
" there were guns in @entity3 long before the @entity3 we know today was even born			1
early settlers in several states were required by law to own and maintain weapons as a matter of collective defense			0
by the time the @entity3 was established , its citizens had taken up arms not only against their @entity84 neighbors but the army of their own king			2
their new constitution reflected that in its @entity91 , declaring that " a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed			0
" for more than two centuries , that remained an important but largely overlooked guarantee , subjected to a modest series of controls			0
but in 2008 and 2010 , landmark @entity101 rulings gave that constitutional right sweeping new power , dramatically diminishing the authority of state and local governments to limit gun ownership			0
gun - friendly lawmakers have been active , too			0
roughly half of the 50 @entity3 states have adopted laws allowing gun owners to carry their guns openly in most public places			1
about as many states have " stand your ground " laws that allow people to kill if they come under threat , even , in some cases , if they can escape the threat without violence			1
the laws are being driven by politics , and the politics are being driven by groups such as the @entity128			0
once a relatively modest organization of gun enthusiasts and hunters , it has become one of the most powerful political groups in the country			0
the @entity136 estimates that the @entity128 succeeded in helping elect four out of every five candidates it endorsed in the most recent congressional election			0
in addition to that extraordinary impact in @entity143 , it has been working to overturn gun - control laws in the courts			2
the @entity128 and other gun - rights groups have allied themselves with the @entity147 and , especially , a sector of the @entity3 public suspicious of government intrusions into private life and often flatly hostile to @entity29			1
read @entity152 : for @entity154 , gun politics are bad politics " when they tell you that a government ban on certain firearms will somehow make you safer , do n't you believe it , not for a second , because it 's a lie just like the lies they 've told you before , " @entity128 ceo @entity156 told a recent gathering of his members			2
" their laws do n't work			2
" poll results suggest most @entity3 would n't agree			2
@entity0 and @entity171 surveys going back years suggest that @entity3 are split between those who approve of current gun - control laws and respondents who would like to see them made more restrictive			1
@entity3 who 'd like no controls at all are a small minority			0
but even after the rampage in @entity10 , @entity3 attitudes and laws are n't likely to change much			1
last year 's nearly fatal shooting of congresswoman @entity182 did n't move her state or federal colleagues to adopt any new gun control measures			0
both president @entity186 and @entity147 challenger @entity187 issued statements in the hours after the @entity10 shootings , and sunday , @entity186 flew to the state to visit with shooting victims and their families			1
but neither proposed any changes to @entity3 attitudes toward guns			1
" you know , soothing words are nice , but maybe it 's time that the two people who want to be president of the @entity3 stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it , because this is obviously a problem across the country , " said @entity8 's @entity7 , who is both a declared " independent " politically and a vocal proponent of gun control			1
@entity208 are marking the first anniversary of a shooting massacre that took the lives of 69 people at a summer camp outside of @entity214			0
eight more people were that day killed by a bomb in the @entity208 capital itself			0
the confessed killer is awaiting the verdict of his trial			0
but @entity3 seems to be the place the whole world thinks of when apparently ordinary people use guns for grotesque acts of violence			1
@entity3 stands alone in its historic and cultural attachment to guns			2
do you own a gun ? tell us why			0
opinion : mass murder and powerful firearms opinion : gun control or carry permits wo n't stop mass murder opinion : @entity239 drives opposition to gun control			0

after @entity10 shootings , neither @entity186 nor @entity187 talked about gun laws
@entity246 : even after the rampage , @entity3 attitudes and laws are n't likely to change much
@entity3 are most heavily armed people per capita , with @entity23 a distant second
@entity246 : @entity253 thinks of @entity3 when apparently ordinary people use guns for grotesque violence
