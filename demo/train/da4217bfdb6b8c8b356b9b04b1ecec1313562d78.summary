@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities have made a concerted effort to censor images and online accounts of a jeep that plowed into crowds in @entity0 's @entity9 , killing five and injuring 38 , amid suggestions police are looking for suspects from the restive western region of @entity14			1
while the cause or motive for monday 's crash remains unclear , one manager at a five - star hotel in @entity0 , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case , told @entity1 that the city 's hotels had received a notice from local police requesting assistance in the investigation of a " major incident " late on monday			1
it listed four people with names that suggested they belonged to the @entity34 ethnic group that comes from @entity14 , where tensions between @entity36 and the largely @entity37 have sometimes turned violent			1
the notice also listed four vehicles -- including two cars and a motorcycle -- with license plate numbers from @entity14 and asked hotels to keep a look out for suspicious guests that may have stayed in the capital from october 1			0
a spokesman for the @entity48 , a diaspora group , said it was too early to blame @entity37 and the group was concerned over the the lack of transparency surrounding the incident			1
" every time something like this happens , authorities usually point fingers at @entity37 , " @entity48 said			0
" the notice should not be taken as the evidence of @entity34 involvement in the incident			2
" @entity62 , an adjunct professor at the @entity64 's @entity63 , said the incident , taking place in @entity3 's most important and sensitive public space , would be considered a major loss of face for @entity0 's leadership , especially if it turned out to be related to @entity34 separatism			1
" it was close to the @entity75 party headquarters and , in terms of timing , it 's on the eve of the plenary session of the @entity81 so they do n't want these rumors and speculation , " he said			0
" according to eye witness reports i 've read online , the jeep was driving at people			0
it appears to be a deliberate attempt to create havoc and a number of casualties , " he said			0
earlier this month , @entity3 police said they had arrested 139 people in @entity14 for spreading religious extremism online			1
the arrests came in the wake of riots that left 35 people dead			0
while a number of @entity3 media outlets reported monday 's incident , their accounts stuck to the bare - bones details published by the official @entity108 news agency			1
no footage was shown on @entity110 , @entity3 's state broadcaster , and the images that appeared immediately after the incident on @entity114 , @entity3 's version of @entity115 , showing black smoke and a vehicle engulfed in flames , were largely deleted			1
searches combining the words tiananmen , terrorism and car crash were also blocked			0
@entity1 broadcasts about the incident were blacked out inside @entity3			2
@entity62 said @entity3 media outlets had likely received an official order to stick to @entity108 's version of events			2
however , the english - language @entity128 , which is state - run but not regarded as an official mouthpiece , reported that police were looking for two suspects from @entity14 in connection with the jeep , which was described as light colored with @entity14 plates			1
of the five people killed , three were the vehicle 's driver and two passengers and the other two were tourists ; a woman from the @entity143 and a @entity3 man			2
authorities moved quickly to tackle the blaze and clear up the scene on monday			0
on tuesday , the square was back to normal			0
@entity1 's @entity149 and @entity150 in @entity0 contributed to this report			0
