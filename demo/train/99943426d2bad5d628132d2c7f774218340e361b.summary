@entity0 -- a country with a @entity5 climate and sparse snowfall , @entity2 is seldom considered a viable competitor in winter sports			1
so when @entity10 and his sister @entity11 take the ice in @entity13 on friday , they will be skating for more than just a medal			1
the ice dancing pair hope to show the world that @entity2 can be a fierce competitor , no matter what the season			1
for @entity10 , 27 , the weather was never a deterrent and competing in the @entity22 was always the goal			1
" i always knew i wanted to be in the @entity24 , since i was 10 , " @entity10 says			1
@entity10 and @entity25 , 22 , who is called @entity26 , were taught to skate by their mother when they were young			1
the siblings began ice dancing , a form of figure skating that focuses more on choreography and draws from the world of ballroom dancing			1
" i do n't remember a moment of life without skating , " @entity10 said			1
" in @entity41 , that was one of the biggest sports and then it kind of became my life slowly			0
then we started skating together and it became our life			0
" the @entity48 were born in @entity49 , @entity50 , under the @entity51			1
their family decided to leave the country as soon as it was possible and moved to @entity2			1
they settled in @entity56 , a city near the @entity58 border , which boasts the country 's only regulation size ice rink			2
@entity56 held a number of challenges for the two young skaters			0
the @entity48 often found themselves with little time on the ice , because they had to share it with other skaters and hockey players , who would come to the rink to practice			2
" the ice time was not enough			2
we had 45 minutes a day and we need much more than that , " @entity25 said			1
" usually one practice here is an hour and a half , so it 's not enough to become an @entity24 athlete			0
" living and practicing so close to @entity58 's border also meant dealing with warfare and instability			0
they had to evacuate the area several times , and the ice rink itself was bombed three times while they were living there			2
despite the difficulties , the pair continued training under their mother 's tutelage until she had taught them everything she knew			2
" our mom was coaching us until we reached the moment where she said , ' ok , i can not give you anymore , ' " @entity10 said			1
" ' you need to go somewhere else if you want to move on			0
' " so in 2001 , when @entity10 was 17 and @entity26 13 , they left home for the @entity103 , where , for the second time in their lives , they had to adjust to a new culture and learn a new language			1
they decided to settle in @entity110 , one of several @entity112 states renowned for its excellent skating coaches			0
for the past three years , the @entity48 have been coached by @entity115 , a former @entity24 ice dancer			2
@entity115 has known the siblings for a long time and even helped pave the way for their @entity24 appearances			0
along with her partner , @entity120 , @entity115 competed in @entity22 three times , including the @entity122 where she placed sixth overall			0
however , @entity115 and @entity120 did not receive much funding from the @entity2 government in the beginning , and @entity115 's parents often supported them			1
" we were the pioneers			0
we did n't get money until we started placing and getting medals , " @entity115 said			0
" @entity10 and @entity26 have it a little bit better than we did			1
" although funding is still hard to come by , @entity115 's father , @entity132 , has provided the majority of the money for the @entity48			0
training @entity24 athletes can bear a hefty price , because there is also a lot of work done off the ice			1
in addition to a coach and booking time on the ice , a choreographer , a @entity144 trainer , a stretch coach , a weight training coach , a masseuse and a costume designer are necessary			1
" it is a project			0
it 's not only money , you become involved in the everyday life of these kids , " @entity152 said			0
" you become like a second father or a foster family			0
" but it is a project the @entity115 family is willing to undertake in order to help build a legacy in @entity2 and cater to the large percentage of the population from the @entity51			1
@entity152 believes @entity168 culture , even when transplanted into a warm climate , is still intricately entwined with winter sports			0
he is confident that this segment of the country wants to see @entity2 compete in the @entity22 and he said he believes the @entity48 can display @entity2 's competitiveness in @entity13 this year			1
the siblings made their first @entity24 appearance in 2006 , where they finished 22nd			2
they had only learned they had qualified two weeks before the ceremonies began and were in awe of the entire experience			0
this time , however , they feel confident they will do better			0
" they 've been skating really well this year and it 's been a really good year for them , " @entity115 said			0
the @entity48 recently placed seventh in the @entity187 in @entity188 , @entity189 , and have been practicing diligently for the @entity24 in @entity13			2
while they would love to bring home a medal , they are also grateful for the opportunity to represent their country			0
" our country never won an @entity24 medal , so we 're hoping for a medal , but placing in the top 10 would be amazing , " @entity10 said			2
win or lose , the @entity48 are hoping to inspire kids back home to pick up the sport and to aim for the @entity24			1
" everything is possible , " @entity10 said			2
" if you want to be there , you 'll be there , so just work hard ! "			0
