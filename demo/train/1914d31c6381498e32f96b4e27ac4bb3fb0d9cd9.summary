@entity0 -- new rules designed to protect credit card users from " unreasonable late payment and other penalty fees " went into effect sunday as a result of the @entity8			1
the rules block credit card companies from charging more than $ 25 for late payments except in extreme circumstances , prevent them from charging customers for not using their cards , and requires them to reconsider rate increases imposed since january 1 , 2009 , according to the @entity16 , which approved the regulations			1
they are the final provisions of federal legislation that placed new restrictions on credit card interest rates and fees , completing the most comprehensive overhaul of the credit card industry in history			0
the banking industry has already made changes in response to the @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 of 2009 , a spokesman said sunday			2
" the industry has moved swiftly to implement all of these changes and the final piece of the puzzle is now in place , " said @entity34 of the @entity35			0
" it will still take some time before we can really see how the landscape has changed , but it is clear that consumer choice and control will ultimately drive further changes in the marketplace , " he said in a statement			0
the @entity16 's rules could result in lower interest rates for consumers			1
banks will have to reduce rates if the reasons for increases imposed in the last 20 months no longer exist , and regulators will review and enforce such cuts			0
consumers will most immediately notice the new penalty fee limit of $ 25			1
reducing penalty fees was a central provision of the credit card law , but @entity64 left it to the @entity16 to determine how to do it			1
the @entity16 leaves room for larger penalty fees to be charged if a consumer has shown a pattern of " repeated " violations or if a card issuer can show that a higher fee reasonably offsets its own costs in dealing with the violation that spurred the penalty			1
among other new rules , penalty fees ca n't exceed the dollar amount incurred by the consumer 's violation that spurred the fee			2
for example , if a customer is late making a $ 20 minimum payment , the fee ca n't exceed $ 20			1
a consumer who exceeds her credit limit by $ 5 can not be charged an over-the - limit fee of more than $ 5			0
consumers will no longer face multiple penalty fees if the violation was based on a single late payment			0
the provisions , which were announced in june , complement previous rules of the 2009 credit card law that are already in effect			1
starting in february , issuers were prohibited from hiking interest rates on existing balances as long as customers paid their bills on time			0
they also have to notify customers at least 45 days in advance of interest rate increases and most fee changes			0
the @entity16 was tasked with figuring out a way to set penalty fees in a way that 's " reasonable and proportional " to the violation that caused the fee			2
consumers scored a win , since these fee caps go beyond what the @entity16 had suggested earlier this year in a draft			2
the $ 25 limit will mean significant savings for consumers who face median penalty fees of $ 39 , according to data collected by the @entity121			1
however , if a cardholder is late or over his credit limit two times within six months , issuers could hike the second penalty fee to $ 35 , or possibly more if the issuer can justify the fee to regulators , according to the @entity16 rules			1
although the @entity16 is cracking down on penalty fees , it has n't addressed the interest rate hikes that are also imposed on consumers who violate the terms of their credit card agreements			2
so a consumer who spends more than his credit card limit by $ 15 may only face a $ 15 fee			0
but that consumer could still face a permanent penalty hike on his interest rate , which would apply to any future purchases			0
still , some banking groups have concerns			0
@entity148 's senior lobbyist @entity147 warned that the @entity16 's cap on penalty fees will limit the industry 's ability to offset the risk that credit cardholders do n't pay their bills			2
" the restrictions in the rules the @entity16 issued will decrease the ability of the credit card industry to price for risk and the net effect will be a decrease in [ credit ] availability , " @entity147 said			1
@entity1 's @entity165 and @entity167 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0

the rules block companies from charging more than $ 25 for late payments in most cases
they also ban charges for not using cards
the @entity16 announced the changes resulting from the @entity8 of 2009
