the @entity0 arose out of frustrations experienced by the @entity6 human rights machinery in dealing with that country			1
the international community was confronted with many reports , both scholarly and reliable , and some informal , of grave human rights violations against the people of the @entity3 ( @entity3 )			1
in january 2013 , the @entity12 , @entity13 , called for a fully - fledged international inquiry into serious crimes said to have been taking place in @entity3 for decades			2
she stressed that the natural concern of the international community about the implications for peace and security of the reported possession by @entity3 of nuclear weapons should not overshadow the deplorable human rights situation in the country			1
but an immediate challenge was presented to the @entity1 by the non-cooperation with the human rights mandate - holders of @entity3			1
@entity3 impasse @entity3 stated publicly that it would " totally reject and disregard " the resolution establishing the @entity1			1
it claimed that this was " a product of political confrontation and conspiracy			0
" in this sense , @entity3 confronted the @entity6 human rights system with an impasse			1
it would not cooperate with @entity39 , a review of the human rights records of all @entity6 member states			1
it would not cooperate with the @entity12			0
it would not cooperate with the present special rapporteur or his predecessor			0
it would not cooperate with the @entity1			2
it wished to be left alone			0
but this was not acceptable because of the substantial and believable testimony and other information demonstrating grave crimes against humanity and other human rights violations on the part of @entity3 , a member country of the @entity6			1
in this particular case , the @entity1 had access to satellite images which were available to it			2
those images , addressed to the vicinity of the towns described by the witnesses , strongly confirmed the existence of large facilities , whose layout and appearance conformed to the descriptions given by witnesses before the @entity1			2
crimes against humanity like documentary interviews of @entity72 survivors , now commonly available in museums created following the @entity75 genocides , witness testimony given to the @entity1 on @entity3 was presented in a low key , matter of fact , generally logical , unemotional and chronological manner			1
based upon the testimony and information received , the @entity1 found that @entity3 authorities had committed , and were continuing to commit , crimes against humanity in political prison camps ; in the ordinary prison system ; by targeting religious believers ; by imposing starvation on large sections of the population ; and by targeting persons , including persons from other countries , and through the course of state sponsored abductions and disappearances			1
the presentation of the @entity1 report to the @entity6 created a sensation			1
no report of a coi of the @entity102 had been so effective , i believe , in drawing attention to victims and to such a broad range of wrongs perpetrated against the civilian population of a member state of the @entity6 to such a shocking degree over such a long period of time			2
unlike earlier totalitarian states and oppressive conduct , the world can not now lament , " if only we had known ... " now , the world does know			0
and the question is whether the world will respond effectively and take the necessary action			0
failures with @entity3 it was frequently said that the greatest danger to human rights in the case of @entity3 was its possession of a reported 20 nuclear armed warheads and its current development of an arsenal of missile delivery systems that could threaten its neighbors and the global community			1
in these circumstances , was there a danger that the injection ( including into the @entity135 ) of " contestable questions " of human rights , would simply divert attention from the highest security priority that the world faced ? the strategy of non-criticism , attempted friendliness and deference was singularly unsuccessful in securing either the goal of peace , national reunification or human rights compliance			1
for example , the meetings in @entity150 in september 2002 with @entity152 's prime minister at the time , @entity151 , and in september 2000 with then - president @entity153 of @entity154 , were not long - term substantive successes			0
in the case of the @entity152 prime minister , a tiny number of abductees were returned with an acknowledgment of a state policy of abductions by the @entity3 that was said to have been abandoned			2
however , when the bones of some of the @entity152 abductees , said to have died in @entity3 , were returned to @entity152 , they were found to have no dna match to the families of the abductees			2
in some cases they were probably animal bones -- an affront to @entity152 and to the abductees ' families			0
negotiations with @entity154 actually coincided with the clandestine development of nuclear weapons at the very time of the promotion of the " @entity179 " by president @entity153			0
whilst such strategies are sometimes rewarded by minor concessions , objectively such measures can only be assessed as " crumbs " when measured against the violations and international crimes reported by the @entity1			2
action from @entity188 and @entity135 ? what is the bottom line ? the charter of the @entity6 gives the five permanent members of the @entity135 a veto that can prevent the passage of resolutions on substantive matters , which the proposed referral of @entity3 to the @entity188 would undoubtedly be			1
the @entity198 has links of tradition , sentiment and history with @entity3 dating to @entity204 times			2
@entity205 has political links and substantial trade and is now the principal economic supporter of @entity3			0
how in these circumstances can the @entity1 seriously expect any real action to the taken by the @entity135 ? in the end , a veto might indeed prevent action being taken upon some of the central recommendations of the @entity216			1
however , the @entity198 now has few economic or other contacts with @entity3			0
@entity205 must itself be deeply concerned , not only by the development of nuclear weapons on its doorstep but also by the dangers of an exodus of civilian populations seeking refuge in the neighboring areas of @entity205			0
the execution of @entity230 , the uncle by marriage of the @entity232 of @entity3 in december 2013 , reportedly an advocate of the " @entity205 path " for @entity3 , must also be a source of concern for @entity205			0
both @entity198 and @entity205 have agreed to the adoption of resolutions on the nuclear weapons program in @entity3 , and to the close monitoring of the sanctions imposed by the @entity135 on @entity3			0
no guarantees the @entity1 can not , of course , guarantee the adoption of a new @entity135 resolution on human rights in @entity3			1
still less can it ensure one that refers the case of @entity3 to the @entity188			0
but that would be the correct , principled step for the @entity6 system to take , based on the @entity1 report			1
it would put human rights up front			1
it would assure accountability for crimes against humanity			0
it would vindicate the international rule of law			0
it would fulfill the " responsibility to protect " human rights , agreed by the @entity258 unanimously in 2005 as a duty of the international community where a given country fails to protect the human rights of its nationals			1
that , assuredly , is the case in @entity3 today			0
the world has therefore reached a moment of truth over @entity3			0
the international community and people everywhere will be watching closely the @entity6 ' consideration of the @entity1 report			2
i am hopeful that the outcome will be positive			0
the human rights of the people of @entity3 demand it			1
the peace and security of the @entity278 and its region require it .			0

@entity6 's @entity0 ( @entity1 ) had no cooperation from @entity3 , *writes* @entity282
strategy of non-criticism , attempted friendliness to @entity3 has not secured peace or human rights compliance
veto might prevent action on some of the central recommendations of the @entity1
@entity6 has responsibility to protect human rights , as duty when given country fails to do so
