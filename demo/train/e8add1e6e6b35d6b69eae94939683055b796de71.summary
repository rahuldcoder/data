@entity0 -- the calendar reads april 2014 , but in some ways it feels like it 's april 2015 , when the next race for the @entity5 will be in full swing			0
and the early moves in the presidential campaign -- at least on the @entity10 side -- seem to be starting a lot earlier than they did last time			1
friday evening rep. @entity12 of @entity13 , the 2012 @entity10 vice presidential nominee , headlines a @entity10 @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the same night sen. @entity17 of @entity18 holds a rally in @entity20 , @entity21			0
the next day @entity17 , sen. @entity22 of @entity23 , and former @entity25 gov. @entity24 , a 2008 @entity10 presidential candidate , all speak at a major conservative conference in @entity28			1
a few days later , @entity22 and former sen. @entity29 of @entity30 , a 2012 @entity10 presidential candidate , make the rounds in @entity32			1
what do all these guys have in common ? they 're all contemplating bids for the @entity5 in 2016			0
and what do the locations they 're visiting have in common ? they 're all crucial early voting states in the presidential primary and caucus calendar , with @entity16 kicking off the voting , @entity21 holding the first primary , and @entity32 the first southern state to vote			1
" there is some sense that the action is starting earlier than four years ago			0
in part , it 's because this is the most wide open field on the @entity10 side in a generation , " veteran @entity21 @entity10 strategist @entity48 said			1
" there 's a sense that no one has a leg up			0
because of that , everyone of the potential presidential candidates is trying to establish themselves and make their case in @entity21 and elsewhere as early as possible , added @entity62 , who was a top adviser to @entity64 in the @entity21 in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns			2
trips to early voting states talk about early			1
according to an informal @entity1 count , @entity17 and @entity22 have already each made seven trips to the three early voting states since the start of 2013			1
add in the five trips @entity29 has made , the four trips each that @entity23 gov. @entity77 and @entity79 gov. @entity78 have made , along with the three that @entity24 has done and that two that @entity13 gov. @entity73 has made , and you 've had one busy campaign calendar the past 16 months			2
" campaigns for president are no longer 12 month campaigns , they are now three or four year - long campaigns , especially for people who have to raise small donations , who ca n't write their own large checks			0
they have to start working these things early , " longtime @entity10 strategist @entity89 , a senior adviser to @entity29 , told @entity1			1
while it 's tradition that potential @entity5 hopefuls make swings through the early voting states well before the midterm elections to reach out to voters , court local politicians , help raise money for local parties , campaign for fellow @entity10 or @entity101 , and start to reach out to donors and campaign strategists , the action started a lot earlier this cycle than it did in the last one			1
most of the @entity10 considering 2012 bids stayed out of the spotlight until after the 2010 midterms , and did n't formally announce their bids until the spring of 2011 , much later than when the candidates in the 2004 and 2008 cycles launched their campaigns			1
@entity16 @entity10 strategist @entity113 says a stronger field this time around may be behind the earlier start			1
" the level of top - tier candidates in 2016 far outpaces the carnival of contenders we saw in 2012			2
this year , the top tier has a much wider shelf , and a number of qualified governors and senators to sit atop it , " said @entity113 , who served as a top adviser to longtime @entity16 gov. @entity122			0
what you are seeing is a qualified crop of candidates who understand they will have to earn every vote this year , " added @entity113			0
" better candidates equals better run and earlier campaigns and that 's what we 're seeing this year			0
" the @entity64 and @entity140 factors even though @entity64 's not running again , he might have something to do with the earlier start this time around			0
" @entity64 was seen as the presumptive frontrunner four years ago			0
he set the pace and he penned the field up for a while , " @entity48 said			0
" there 's no heir apparent this time around			0
" @entity113 agreed : " in 2012 , @entity64 singularly owned the top tier and any votes he did n't get were largely protest votes			0
if you look at ( @entity154 ) @entity153 , @entity29 , ( @entity155 ) @entity156 , ( @entity158 ) @entity157 , etc. last election , nobody conceivably thought they could be president , but they largely ended up as a protest vote			0
" another factor : president @entity140 's approval ratings were hovering around 50 % at this point in the 2012 cycle			0
now he 's a term - limited president with approval ratings in the low to mid 40s			0
" given the discontent with the current administration , disappointment with @entity178 , and distrust of @entity101 leadership , voters are looking for a strong conservative leader to restore confidence in our economy and government , " said @entity171 , a @entity10 strategist and radio talk show host who worked as a senior adviser for @entity24 in 2008 and for @entity29 and @entity153 in 2012			1
where are the @entity101 ? while the potential @entity10 presidential contenders criss - cross the campaign trail , the @entity101 remain on the sidelines			1
vice president @entity190 gives the commencement address next month at the @entity192 , which will be his third trip to the @entity32 in the past year			2
he 's was in @entity21 last month on an official @entity5 visit on jobs and the economy			0
and last september , he headlined @entity16 sen. @entity197 's annual @entity196			0
and @entity199 gov. @entity198 , another potential candidate , has swung through @entity32 and @entity21			2
but the traffic comes no where close to matching the miles the @entity10 have logged			2
with a @entity101 incumbent in the @entity5 , 2016 party hopefuls have to carry a lighter footprint than their @entity10 counterparts			1
@entity207 freezes the field another obvious reason : @entity207			1
the former secretary of state says she 'll decide by the end of the year whether she makes another run for the @entity5 , and if she does launch a bid , she 'll instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the @entity101 nomination			2
" i do think @entity207 freezes the field in a way no non-incumbent ever has			1
even @entity219 had an impressive primary opponent in @entity221			0
nothing tall grows in the shade , and @entity207 casts a mighty big shadow , " said @entity222 , a @entity1 contributor and longtime adviser to both @entity221 and @entity207 , who 's also an adviser to @entity225 , the super pac set up to support @entity140 's 2012 re-election that 's now raising money for a potential @entity207 campaign			2
@entity101 strategist @entity232 said the vast difference in activity says a lot about the state of the race			2
" the heavy campaign activity on the @entity10 side matches the level of uncertainty in the field -- we have n't seen such doubt about the presumptive nominee in several election cycles			1
on the @entity101 side , that seems to be flipped , usually there is a lot of uncertainty leading to a crowded primary season , but whether it 's @entity256 or @entity190 , you 've got widely known candidates who could scale up a robust campaign effort whenever they decide , " added @entity232 , who worked for @entity140 from his @entity247 years through the 2012 campaign .			1

@entity10 seem to be getting things going already
candidates making trips to early voting states
@entity190 and @entity198 traveling around , but where are all the other @entity101 ?
