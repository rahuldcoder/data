-- this week 's episode of " @entity2 " featured a pretty unforgettable smile - inducing kicker			1
after @entity4 found himself bemoaning his romantic setbacks and lack of personal progress , a look into the not - so - distant future revealed he had a daughter			2
tear up ? join the club			2
but would you have guessed that the moment was n't even part of the greater plan for the season ? " we had a week of treading water , to be honest , " says co-creator / executive producer @entity17			1
" we have the arc of the season going , but this was one week where there was n't one , specific big event happening			1
we always get nervous about those kinds of episodes because you want to know that the story is moving forward			2
" so , he says , they took a " step back , " and decided to put a little perspective on the overall story of the series			0
" we were really telling the story that a father probably should tell his kids because it was only 22 minutes as opposed to seven seasons , " he jokes			0
indeed the flashbacks and talk about the past was a nice reminder of where we 've been with the gang			0
but as @entity17 sees it , it 's also a great reminder of where we 're going -- without giving everything away			1
yes , he admits , they made sure @entity49 hid his left hand so we would n't know whether or not @entity51 would be married three years from now			0
" he 's so good at making that look natural , " he says , laughing			1
" he 's a magician ; he 's good with his hands			1
he knows what he 's doing " but does @entity51 ? this episode saw the once notorious womanizer seemingly settling into life as a one - woman man			1
to be fair , @entity59 previously warned @entity0 that @entity51 and @entity60 would be on the fast track			0
but after just a few episodes of courting , they 're living together ... and liking it ! is it all too fast ? @entity17 does n't think so			1
" i think @entity51 is in love			0
at a certain age , you stop worrying about the pacing so much and you sort of realize you 're only on this planet a short time so you might as well be with the person you care about the most , " he says			0
" and i think that 's @entity60 right now for @entity51			1
" the best way to show that , he says , was to break barriers -- by breaking wind			0
" we put off having a fart sound effect on our show for seven years , and we did pretty well without it			0
and it was one of those things as a showrunner that you know two things right away : you 're going to be embarrassed that you 're doing it at the table read , and you know that in the final cut , it 's going to be the funniest moment and get a laugh , " he says			2
" and it 's not ' @entity95 ' -- cowboys sitting around eating beans â € ” it 's actually a very real threshold to cross in a relationship			2
it 's a big relationship moment			2
" so where do they go from here ? for one , @entity60 and @entity51 will continue moving pretty quickly , he says , and next week , we 'll see more from @entity107 ( @entity108 ) than we did in this episode			1
" @entity107 , there is some excitement in her life coming up , especially next week 's episode , " he says			1
when we pick up , @entity107 and @entity4 still are n't talking and viewers are going to see how that affects their lives and friendship			0
" we went for the reality of those situations , " he says			0
" i feel like on this show we 've gone as far as we can go where it 's just the gang hanging out at the bar week in and week out , with these big thing happen to them that do n't really change things			1
@entity4 and @entity107 have now reached the point where it 's not as simple as hanging out at the bar and forgetting the fact that @entity4 's in love with her , and she 's not in love with him			2
" but , not to worry , he says			0
" i feel like [ there 's ] a satisfying ending -- the way it all wraps up as the season comes to a close			1
