@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 media call her " @entity9 , " portray her as a " devil with an angel 's face , " and there are 11 @entity7 pages dedicated to her , all in @entity1			1
both @entity13 ( left ) and @entity9 deny charges of murder and sexual assault			1
@entity9 , 21 , is an @entity17 college student from @entity18 , @entity19 , who is on trial for murder in @entity23 , @entity1			1
the case has given @entity25 almost pop star status there			2
she was voted the top woman in an online " person of the year " poll by an @entity1 tv channel in december , beating out @entity32 , the @entity1 - born @entity33 first lady			2
seven of the 11 @entity7 pages champion her innocence ; four seem convinced that @entity25 is pure evil			2
a sampling of comments : " no to @entity9			2
no to her superstardom " ... " she 's a sociopath " ... " everyone is not sure if she is guilty or not and that she will lead us to a new existential awareness			0
please shout with me your anger			0
... let 's say no. let 's say @entity25			2
" @entity25 and former boyfriend @entity13 , 24 , are charged with murdering and sexually assaulting one of @entity25 's roommates , @entity55 exchange student @entity53 , on november 1 , 2007			1
they insist they are innocent and are disputing the allegations			0
@entity25 and @entity13 are due back in court today			1
the last time @entity25 appeared before the panel of eight judges , she wore a t - shirt quoting @entity64 : " all you need is love			2
" prosecutor @entity67 alleges that @entity68 , 21 , was killed because she refused to participate in a drug - fueled sex game played by @entity25 , @entity13 , and a third man , @entity71 native @entity70			1
in court papers , prosecutors stated that @entity13 held @entity68 by her wrists while @entity25 poked at her with a knife and @entity70 sexually assaulted her			1
the case is being tried in @entity23 , a university town about 115 miles north of @entity0 that is better known for its chocolate than for its scandalous murder trials			0
according to the prosecutor 's office , @entity68 had been in @entity1 for two months as part of a year - long course with @entity83 , where she was working toward a degree in @entity85			2
she shared a house with @entity25 , a @entity88 student in the same exchange program , and two @entity1 housemates			1
the crime scene , which has become a tourist attraction , has been broken into twice , police say			0
@entity25 and @entity13 were arrested november 6 , 2007 , and were kept in prison while an investigation continued			1
the judge overseeing the investigation found both were capable of committing the crime again , fleeing the country or tampering with the evidence			0
police sought charges in july 2008 , and they were ordered to trial in october			0
the trial began january 16 and has been held mostly on weekends			0
@entity1 newspapers assigned their top crime reporters , and the case has received unprecedented international coverage			2
@entity25 has appeared on the cover of @entity110 , which shares a corporate parent with @entity2			2
a random sampling of women on the streets of @entity0 showed that all of them had heard of the case and most believed @entity25 and @entity13 were at the very least implicated in the slaying			1
the superheated publicity surrounding the case helped make @entity25 a household name in @entity1			1
she is usually portrayed as a femme fatale			1
consider these headlines : " @entity125 , lies and stabbings " " lovers without any inhibitions " " and in prison , she even tries to sun tan " @entity1 journalists also have plastered their newspapers with photos they found of @entity25 on the @entity135 , especially images that showed her as a " wild girl			1
" they pounced on the " @entity9 " nickname they found on her @entity142 page , even though her parents later explained the high school moniker came from the way @entity25 played soccer , quick like a fox			1
although @entity1 law limits the publication of court and police records , the media ban is less strict than in many @entity156 countries			1
while it is not exactly legal to publish police investigative reports , no journalist has gone to jail in @entity1 for doing it			2
among the items leaked : @entity25 's diary , various police interrogations , photos of @entity68 's body , video of @entity68 's body ( which wound up on @entity170 but has been pulled ) , and video of the @entity1 forensic police carrying out their investigation			1
eventually , even the leaks made headlines , leading to more speculation			0
@entity25 can do no right in the @entity1 media			1
if she appears reserved and timid in court , she is portrayed as someone with plenty to hide			0
if she smiles or laughs in court , she 's called disrespectful			0
as far as the @entity1 media is concerned , @entity25 is the mastermind who manipulated those around her and seduced her @entity1 boyfriend and led him astray			1
while @entity25 and @entity13 's preliminary hearings were being held in october , @entity70 was convicted of murder after a fast - track trial			1
his lawyers had hoped that the speedy resolution of the case would give him a break at sentencing			0
he got 30 years in prison			0
according to testimony at @entity70 's trial , his fingerprints were found in the house , and his dna was linked to @entity68 's body			1
he has never denied being in the house the night of the slaying but insists he did n't kill her			0
he says he had an " appointment " with her that night and was in the bathroom when she was killed			0
@entity13 and @entity25 say they were n't at the house the night of the slaying			1
they say they both were at @entity13 's house			1
but the alibi has been contradicted by witnesses at the trial			0
eighty - six media outlets sent 140 journalists to cover the opening of the trial in january , but publicity has waned since then			0
the @entity1 24 - hour news channel @entity222 no longer breaks into its programming with multiple updates			0
@entity25 , for now , has been relegated to the pages preceding the sports or weather report			0
but @entity1 love their murder cases , and attention has shifted to other crime news			2
a mother is accused of killing her toddler son , a husband and wife are accused of multiple killings			0
their courtrooms are now filled with spectators who wait in line an hour or more			0
the @entity23 courtroom still is packed , but the long line is gone			0
that is likely to change , however , as testimony shifts to the defense case .			0

murder trial makes @entity17 student notorious in @entity1
@entity9 , 21 , is accused with former boyfriend , @entity13
@entity55 student @entity53 found dead in house shared with @entity25
@entity1 media portrays @entity25 as seductive femme fatale
