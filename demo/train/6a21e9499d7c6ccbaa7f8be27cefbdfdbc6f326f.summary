-- did you learn anything new in 2014 ? of course , your brain is filled with facts about this year 's events from the rise of @entity7 to the @entity9 ice bucket challenge			1
but my question is : are you saying goodbye to 2014 having learned some new life lessons ? i 'll give you a moment to think about it			1
( cue " @entity15 " music )			1
to be honest , many of the things i learned in 2014 -- as in 2013 -- sucked			1
and no doubt many of you would agree with me			2
here are nine things i wish we had n't learned in 2014 : 1			1
a really excited black man is called a " thug , " but a white criminal is called @entity23			1
in january , @entity26 star @entity25 caused a media uproar because of his animated post game interview after his team won the @entity31 championship			2
apparently to some , @entity25 was too excited for their liking and they labeled this @entity35 grad a " thug			2
" yet in the same month , @entity23 was arrested , accused of drag racing and driving under the influence after admitting to smoking marijuana and taking pills			1
later this year , he was ordered to pay $ 80,900 in restitution for throwing eggs at his former neighbor 's home and was placed on probation , with a requirement that he take anger management sessions and perform five days of community labor			2
if @entity25 had done that , what do you think they would have called him ? likely answer : prisoner number _ _ _ _ _ _ _			2
a cantankerous cat earns more money than me ( and likely you , too			1
) yep , i 'm talking " grumpy cat			2
" that grouchy feline 's petulant puss is plastered on products from mugs to t - shirts to even a grumpy cat pillowcase for those who want @entity68 's face to be the last they see before they fall asleep and the first thing they see when they wake up			1
how much did this cat rake in ? it 's unclear but the cat 's manager ( and , yes , the cat also has a manager ) claimed it was in the seven figures while the cat 's owner claimed it was less			2
in any event , the lesson is if you have choice between getting a really cute cat or one that looks like an angry @entity90 waiting on a long line , pick the latter			2
some politicians will even use a deadly disease to score political points			1
i thought i had seen every way politicians could scare us , but @entity100 came up with something new to use in 2014 : ebola			1
while medical professionals were telling us to remain calm , some @entity100 were telling us to freak out			2
one @entity100 senator even warned of the " real and present danger " that @entity7 fighters might infect themselves and then infect us			2
of course , after @entity107 , we did n't hear a peep from these same people about @entity110 as it became clear that the risk to the @entity112 was minimal			1
can you imagine what they will use in 2015 to scare us ? 4			1
a " hot " mug shot can get you not one but two @entity118 agents			2
you might not recognize the name @entity120 but you likely recognize his mug shot			0
he was the guy known as the " hot convict " whose photo , taken after he was arrested on gang and weapons related charges , became a viral sensation this spring			0
next thing you know , he had a modeling agent and a second agent to help him with endorsements and acting work			0
the takeaway here is that if you are trying to be discovered , forget acting classes or toiling away in small comedy clubs , just make sure you look " hot " when you get arrested			0
@entity138 had a higher voter turnout than the @entity112 this year			0
in april , @entity138 's presidential election saw about 60 % of eligible voters cast a ballot			0
but in our country , only 36 % bothered to vote in november			0
and keep in mind , people in @entity138 risked their lives to vote because of threats by the @entity149			1
in our country , the biggest fear if you voted was missing an episode of " @entity153 " or " @entity154			0
" perhaps we need the people of @entity138 to make @entity156 's telling us about the importance of voting ? 6			1
racial inequities are even worse than many of us suspected			0
black teens have a 21 times greater chance of being killed by the police than white teens			0
in a year marked by controversy over police tactics and race , this report by @entity166 released this year painfully crystallized the issue			0
they found , based on the limited data available , that , shockingly , black teenagers are far more likely to be killed by the police than their white counterparts			0
@entity166 deserves credit for bringing this finding to light , and we can only hope that it will help spur change in 2015			0
how do black parents tell their teenagers that simply because of his or her skin color , there 's a 21 times greater chance that the police will kill them than their white teenage friends ? 7			0
@entity191 's butt can break the @entity192			1
@entity112 seemingly lost its mind over photos of a seminaked ( and really naked ) @entity191 that were published by @entity195			1
it 's as if people did n't realize that the @entity192 was already filled with naked photos of this famous reality show star			1
yet these images were the talk of countless media outlets and drove 4 million people to @entity195 's website , which was a 2,379 % increase over visitors to that website from the month before			1
on the upside , however , the photos did launch a multitude of hilarious memes including one featuring " @entity212 's " @entity211			0
the naked selfies i took might be hacked			0
ok , i do n't have any naked selfies			0
to be honest , i barely can look at photos of myself fully clothed and not be struck with a sense of disappointment			0
but this year a bevy of celebrities found out that even your most private photos that have been stored in what has been billed as a secure server are not safe			0
this is just another example of how it appears that we are collectively losing any hope of privacy			0
the 2016 presidential race could be @entity230 versus @entity231			0
with former @entity233 gov. @entity231 recently announcing that he was exploring a run for president and almost instantly topping the polls among @entity100 contenders , and with @entity238 being the presumed @entity239 front - runner , we could see a replay of families from the 1992 presidential race in 2016			1
while they are both solid candidates , i fear a match up between these political " royal families " could turn more people off from politics			1
can we at least mix it up a little and get a @entity249 or @entity250 into the race ? so that 's my list , but what about yours ? c'mon , there must be things you wish you had n't learned in 2014			1
tell us about them in the comments section below			0
and best wishes for a happy and healthy 2015 filled with lessons you are glad you learned .			0
