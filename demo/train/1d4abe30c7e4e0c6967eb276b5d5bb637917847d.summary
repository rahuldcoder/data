states struggling to define the question of marriage equality have an addition to their ranks : @entity6			2
a @entity8 district judge struck down @entity6 's ban on same - sex marriage friday after two @entity12 women sued the state for failing to recognize the couple 's union			1
@entity16 and @entity17 were married legally in @entity18 and have been together for 15 years			0
but the issue of their rights as a couple came about after @entity16 's petition to adopt @entity17 's 9 - year - old son was denied			0
@entity6 's adoption code gives a person a right to adopt a spouse 's child			2
but because @entity6 does n't recognize their marriage , @entity16 could not qualify for adoption			0
the couple 's lawyer , @entity33 , said @entity17 and @entity16 were " very pleased with the court 's ruling			0
" " we are happy for the tens of thousands of gay @entity38 and their children , " @entity33 said			0

" the state filed a motion friday seeking to put a hold on the judge 's decision pending a ruling from the @entity8 @entity50 , effectively trying to keep couples from applying for marriage licenses in the meantime			1
the @entity50 has previously refused to hear cases from states -- @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , to name a few -- seeking to keep their bans against same - sex marriage in place			1
