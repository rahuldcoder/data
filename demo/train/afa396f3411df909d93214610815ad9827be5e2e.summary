@entity0 seems to be on life support , filing for bankruptcy protection this week for the second time in four years			2
but at one time , what 's now seen as grandma 's magazine was an influential and powerful force in politics and culture			0
when i began my book on the @entity0 , people were incredulous			2
" but no one takes that seriously , " they 'd say			0
" people only read it when they 're waiting to see the dentist			0
" yet , those who dismiss the magazine as trivial underestimate the @entity0 's impact on millions of @entity19 ' view of the world			1
from its humble beginnings in 1922 , @entity0 became the highest circulating general interest magazine in the @entity19 , reaching more than 16 million readers a month			1
from 1938 on , the @entity0 could be read in 17 languages			2
in the @entity19 , @entity0 had the highest subscription rate of any magazine except tv guide			1
@entity0 started life not long after the emergence of the @entity30			1
initially , the magazine was sympathetic to the @entity32 revolution , seeing it as a movement against what it regarded as undemocratic , aristocratic @entity37 society			0
by the 1930s , however , it had identified the @entity30 with communism			2
later , it began to publish stories that portrayed the @entity30 state as the primary danger to @entity45			1
the @entity0 presented the @entity19 and @entity30 as polar opposites			1
as well as running clearly political articles that explained international relations and threats to peace , the magazine 's ostensibly apolitical stories reinforced this image of two incompatible societies			0
descriptions of everyday life in @entity45 and the @entity30 detailed how different @entity19 were from @entity32 , how different @entity32 ' music was , their food , their sense of humor -- even @entity32 sex lives were different			1
at the extreme , in 1981 a story about an @entity19 in @entity63 seemed to suggest biological differences when it reported the @entity19 's body rejected a @entity32 blood transfusion			2
these types of stories earned the digest a reputation as a leading voice in anti-communism			0
as it gained prominence , @entity0 drew criticism			2
despite the publication 's determination to celebrate individual freedoms , it was accused of being nothing more than state propaganda			1
there were claims of @entity85 funding and editorial control , especially in its foreign editions in @entity89			0
whether these accusations were true or not , the magazine 's influence in popular culture could perhaps be seen as even more powerful and pernicious			0
as a digest , the magazine sought not to reflect the immediate news but issues and ideas of " lasting interest			0
" famously , @entity100 was said to have a box full of @entity0 articles that he had collected for reference			0
@entity0 meant to provide readers with all of the information they needed to know about what was important in the world , what @entity45 's role in the world should be and what they , as good citizens , should do to preserve the @entity19 way			1
it became a trusted source of news			0
in the days before electronic communication , it was perhaps the only source that many people , particularly those in rural areas , could access regularly			0
@entity0 presented itself as a guardian of @entity19 morality and values			1
in june 1960 , a @entity0 advertisement quoted president @entity129 as saying , " our magazines are a leading force for moral and cultural growth in our country and one of the surest guarantees of an informed public			2
" exactly what the relationship was between @entity0 and state foreign policy is unclear , but its role in encouraging @entity19 readers to think about and actively engage in world affairs is beyond doubt			1
in the february 1969 issue , apparently fearing a lack of support for the @entity149 , @entity0 launched a " @entity151 " campaign , inserting flag decals into the 18 million copies of the magazine			0
a follow - up survey indicated that 78 % of readers had detached the flag , and half of those people had put it to use			0
a few years earlier , an article on how @entity161 resisted a communist takeover was deemed to contain such " vital , useful information for every nation menaced by communist subversion " that readers were encouraged to send it -- and free reprints -- to friends abroad , or to place it into " the hands of concerned people [ whom readers ] may meet " on vacation			0
when relations with the @entity30 began to thaw , the @entity0 feared that @entity19 were overlooking the danger presented by the @entity30			1
during detente and the beginnings of the end of the @entity180 , articles warned readers not to trust those who suggested that the @entity30 could change			1
the fall of the @entity183 heralded a collapse of the @entity0 's moral certainty about the difference between @entity45 and its old enemy			0
perhaps the decline of @entity0 's fortunes was inevitable with the longer - term social and political influences of 60s counterculture , the failure of general interest magazines , the rise of global media targeted at specific niches and the advent of the internet			1
but of equal importance was the end of the @entity30 threat : with the fall of its arch enemy , the @entity203 , there was no mirror against which it could present an alternative image of @entity45 and its historic mission .			1

@entity210 : @entity0 once had a huge role in shaping opinion
@entity210 : digest propagated @entity180 view that @entity30 was a primary danger to @entity19 way
@entity0 was *hugely* popular , she says , but critics called it state propaganda
@entity210 : it declined with the end of general interest magazines and fear of the @entity203
