-- the world 's most famous scientist , with his iconic wild hair , crumpled suit , and pens peeking from breast pocket , poses not in a laboratory -- but on the deck of a ship			1
it 's a candid image of @entity11 in his leisure time , taken on one of many trips aboard @entity16 vessels between @entity17 and @entity18 in the 1930s			1
three years after this photograph was taken , the @entity20 came into power in @entity11 's homeland @entity24 , and he traveled to the @entity25 on one of these huge passenger steamers for good , in a journey that may well have saved the @entity31 physicist 's life			1
the @entity33 winning scientist was one of 2.5 million people who sailed across the @entity35 with the boat company between 1873 and 1934 -- a quarter of them @entity31			1
now their remarkable stories -- many escaping persecution in @entity17 and investing their savings in a better life in the @entity42 -- have been immortalized in a new $ 25 million @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45			1
" the most important artifact we 're showing is the actual building -- it was the control center for all third class passengers , " said museum co-ordinator @entity46 , of the renovated red brick warehouses on the @entity49 , which until now had been left to rot			0
" inside we have a collection of ship models , stories , pictures , letters , even a @entity45 waffle iron , and the piano of composer @entity61 -- it shows something about what was important to people of the time			2
" lifesaver along with @entity11 and @entity61 -- the composer of famous songs " @entity68 " and " there 's @entity70 " -- was another passenger who fled @entity17 to forge a successful career in the @entity25 lawyer , author and prominent feminist , @entity75 , was just five years old when her family traveled from @entity44 to @entity77 in 1934			1
today she is believed to be one of just five surviving @entity16 passengers , and the only who attended the museum 's opening last month			1
the daughter of @entity31 @entity86 clothing merchants living in @entity87 , 85 - year - old @entity83 says she would have died at the hands of the @entity20 if her family had n't caught the @entity89 that fateful day			0
" it was a lifesaver , absolutely , " said the mother - of - one , adding that the @entity44 authorities had planned to deport the family before they boarded the ship			2
" there 's no question of the role the @entity16 played in the lives of people who escaped the @entity100			1
" historic journey while @entity83 was too young to remember the 10 - day journey across the @entity35 , her 18 - year - old brother @entity104 , who had convinced the family to join him in @entity44 , kept a diary of the voyage , copies of which now appear in the museum			2
" my brother wrote that we were seasick the whole time , " says @entity83 , and indeed , life on the ships was cramped and dreary for third class passengers			0
" in the early years , third class passengers were in large , communal cabins without water or light			2
they could go outside for some air once a day , " said @entity46			0
" but towards the end , it got a lot better and they started investing in small dormitories with six people in a room			0
" " first class however , was more like a luxury hotel , with huge ballrooms for dancing			0
" with a third class ticket valued at around $ 1,300 in today 's money , a laborer would have had to work 75 days to cover the cost			0
third class passengers also had to undergo rigorous health checks before boarding , with anyone refused entry at @entity141 immigration center in @entity77 sent back at the expense of the shipping line			0
passengers would take hour - long showers with hot vinegar and benzene , cleaning them of lice , while their luggage was disinfected in large steam sterilizing machines			0
ship - shape founded by @entity44 and @entity154 ship brokers almost 150 years ago , the @entity16 heralded a golden era for transatlantic ocean travel , and during its heyday two vessels left for @entity18 each week			1
" people left @entity17 for a variety of reasons -- poverty , the rise of industrialism meant a lot of small family businesses went bankrupt , political or racial persecution , and adventurers with small capital who had heard about the prosperity on the other side of the ocean , " said @entity46			2
for @entity83 , the most emotional moment of her return to @entity44 , was standing at the very same water 's edge where her family set sail 80 years ago			1
" if it was n't for that journey i would n't have had a life , or a daughter , " she said			0
" my brother would n't have had children and grandchildren and great grandchildren			0
my parents would n't have had lives , none of that would have happened if we had n't traveled on the @entity16			2

@entity11 escaped @entity197 rule by sailing on @entity16 ship 80 years ago
