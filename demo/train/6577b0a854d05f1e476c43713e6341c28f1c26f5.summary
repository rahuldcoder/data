-- it is a horse that most certainly meets with royal approval but for now the @entity3 is happy for her filly estimate to luxuriate in the grounds of her @entity7 estate			1
but even while the four - year - old puts her feet up after a hectic year on the track she is still winning prizes -- adding the prestigious @entity11 to her impressive haul of trophies			1
estimate 's most notable triumph was victory at the @entity17 , as a thrilled looking @entity3 cheered it home from the @entity18 at @entity19			1
ridden by @entity20 , @entity15 stormed to victory in the prestigious @entity23 race in june , the first time in its 207 - year history that the @entity27 monarch had owned the winner			1
but that is not the extent of her exhaustions			0
estimate has also won four other @entity34 -- the 1,000 and @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 -- meaning that only the @entity38 eludes her			2
the @entity3 received the award at @entity41 on monday and the footage was shown to around 330 guests who attended the ceremony at @entity46 's @entity45			2
the 87 - year - old said : " thank you very much indeed and it 's very nice to accept the award on behalf of @entity15 , who did all the work			1
" estimate is sitting in a field at @entity7 now having a rest and watching the deer and things like that			0
perhaps she 'll come back into training next year			0
" i shall be thrilled to keep that ( the @entity63 trophy ) and have it as a memento			0
i was just looking at it and thinking it could join all the trophies we have at @entity19			2
" we have all the trophies			0
i have actually managed to win the @entity70 , which is unusual			0
" horse racing has long been a love of the royal family , the @entity3 's father @entity74 passing on his love of the sport to his daughter @entity3			1
the queen mother also had a passion for steeplechase racing and when she died at the age of 101 in 2002 , she could boast 449 winners in her royal colors			2
" she adores breeding racehorses , " the @entity3 's racing manager @entity83 told @entity0			2
" the @entity27 bloodstock industry is very lucky to have a patron such as the @entity3			0
" said to name all her own horses , the @entity3 has @entity89 studs at @entity7 and @entity90 in @entity91 and @entity92 in @entity93 , with around 25 horses racing a season			0
the @entity96 gong went to unbeaten three - year - old @entity99 filly @entity97 , who won this year 's @entity100			1
she also claimed the @entity101 and @entity102 crowns , emulating the feat of @entity104 in 2008 who also won all three titles in a season			0
@entity97 was purchased at auction by the @entity110 - based @entity109 for Â £ 50,000 , a snip considering its value after winning the $ 6.25 million @entity100 .			1

the queen 's horse estimate wins the @entity11 after a *stellar* year
the four - year - old filly won the @entity17 at @entity19 in front of the queen
her *majesty* is a keen horse racing *enthusiast* just like her mother and father
@entity100 winner @entity97 takes the @entity128 gong
