-- with the planned settlement between @entity4 and book publishers still on indefinite hold , a legal battle by proxy has started			1
@entity4 partnered with many libraries at @entity9 universities in order to gain access to the works it wants to digitize			1
now , several groups that represent book authors have filed suit against those universities , attempting to block both digital lending and an orphaned works project			1
the suit is being brought by the @entity21 , its equivalents in @entity23 , @entity24 , and the @entity25 , and a large group of individual authors			0
its target : some major @entity9 universities , including @entity31 , the @entity33 system , and @entity34			0
these libraries partnered with @entity4 to get their book digitization efforts off the ground and , in return , @entity4 has provided them with digital copies of the works			1
these and many other universities have also become involved with the @entity42 , an organization set up to help them archive and distribute digital works ; the @entity42 is also named as a defendant			2
the suit seeks to block two separate efforts			0
in the first , the universities have created a pooled digital archive of the contents of their libraries , maintained by the @entity42			2
no one contests that these works remain in copyright , or that the universities have rights to the nondigital forms of these works			0
what the authors object to is the fact that the digital works are derived from an unauthorized scan , and will be stored in a single archive that is no longer under the control of the university from which the scan was derived			1
the suit suggests that the security of this archive is also suspect , and may allow the mass release of copyrighted work			0
a separate issue in the suit is an orphaned works project started by the @entity42 that focuses on some of the works within this archive			2
the group is attempting to identify out - of - copyright books , and those where the ownership of copyright can not be established			0
if attempts to locate and contact any copyright holders fail , and the work is no longer commercially available , the @entity42 will start providing digital copies to students without restrictions			0
this has not gone over well			0
the executive director of the @entity87 , @entity88 , stated , " this group of @entity9 universities has no authority to decide whether , when or how authors forfeit their copyright protection			1
these are n't orphaned books , they 're abducted books			1
" the authors ' coalition would like to see everything grind to a halt -- @entity4 and the libraries kept from any further scanning , the @entity42 's orphaned works project shuttered , and the digital copies on its servers impounded			1
the digital works would n't be deleted , but it wants to see " any computer system storing the digital copies powered down and disconnected from any network , pending an appropriate act of @entity110			2
" ( note that they want them shut down and unplugged , just to be sure			0
) the @entity113 was actually a party to the @entity4 book settlement , so it 's not like it objects to the effort per se			1
however , the university libraries had not been a party to it , so this may be the @entity21 's attempt to tie up loose ends when it comes to nailing down digital rights			1
alternately , they may simply be sending a message that , until the settlement is approved , none of @entity4 's efforts should be reaching even a limited segment of the public			2
in either case , this suit could go a long way towards establishing how many digital rights are granted with the ownership of a book			0
