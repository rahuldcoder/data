-- the man who allegedly lit an explosive on board a @entity6 - bound international flight deserves none of the constitutional protections afforded @entity6 citizens , a former top @entity2 administration official said monday			1
@entity10 , who served as secretary of the @entity12 from 2003 to 2005 , made the comments on @entity0 's " @entity14			1
" " i take a look at this individual who has been charged criminally , does that mean he gets his @entity19 warnings ? the only information we get is if he volunteers it ? " @entity10 said			2
" he 's not a citizen of this country			2
he 's a terrorist , and i do n't think he deserves the full range of protections of our criminal justice system embodied in the @entity31			1
" @entity10 also said he was " not surprised " about reports that two former detainees in the detention center at the @entity6 @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , had joined up with the group that claimed responsibility for @entity41 's failed terrorist attack			1
" it 's a symptom of a larger challenge that this country has , and that 's how do you adjudicate these individuals that we pick up from these places and make a determination if they should be incarcerated for a long time , if not permanently , " he said			0
@entity52 , also known as @entity53 , and @entity54 were released to @entity55 in 2007 by the @entity2 administration			0
the two went through a " rehabilitation " program in @entity55 but returned to the militants			0
@entity6 officials , however , cautioned that the two could not be connected with friday 's attack			2
@entity10 told @entity64 that the country is " clearly ... safer , but it 's equally clear , given the several incidents that have occurred in the last couple of months in this country , that we still have very serious gaps in information - sharing			1
" " what are we going to do to make sure more information , particularly with that kind of information that sends warning signals out , gets to the people that can act on it ? " he said			0
" whether you 're in the battlefield in @entity83 or @entity84 or a screener at the airport , you need actionable information			0
i 'm not sure all this information was in the hands of @entity90 at the time			0
" @entity10 also questioned why the @entity92 did not revoke @entity41 's visa upon learning that his father had reported his son might have terrorist connections			1
" why the @entity92 did n't revoke his visa immediately is beyond belief , in my judgment , " he said			2
" but at the heart of this , it 's a clash of cultures and institutional challenge			0
[ the @entity12 ] can only act on information it has , and they did n't have all the information at its disposal			1
" the former secretary was less critical of current secretary @entity111 than many other @entity112 for comments she made praising the way some protocols had worked			1
" i do n't think any right - thinking person actually believed that @entity118 thought the system worked , " he said			2
" obviously , it was flawed			0
i think what she was referring to was that after the incident occurred , there are certain procedures and protocols to put in place			0
