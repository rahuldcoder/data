-- bipartisan legislation was introduced in the @entity2 on thursday that would authorize new economic sanctions on @entity4 if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions			1
the proposal led by @entity12 chairman @entity11 , a @entity14 @entity13 , and @entity15 , an @entity17 @entity16 , emerged despite @entity19 administration appeals for @entity20 to defer pursuing new sanctions with diplomatic efforts ongoing			1
the @entity23 said new sanctions would undermine those delicate efforts on the global stage and president @entity19 would veto the legislation if @entity20 were to approve it now			1
a letter sent to senate majority leader @entity28 from nine @entity30 committee chairs said international talks over @entity4 's nuclear program should continue without additional sanctions being imposed by @entity20			1
" we believe that new sanctions would play into the hands of those in @entity4 who are most eager to see the negotiations fail , " the letter states			0
but proponents of the plan that sprouted from bipartisan talks involving several lawmakers said the threat of stepped - up action could be a powerful lever against @entity4 's nuclear interests and work toward more fruitful diplomacy			1
" current sanctions brought @entity4 to the negotiating table and a credible threat of future sanctions will require @entity4 to cooperate and act in good faith at the negotiating table , " @entity11 said in a statement announcing the legislative effort			2
rep. @entity55 , a @entity56 @entity16 , told @entity0 's @entity57 that he would support the sanctions			0
" the fact is that if @entity4 is serious about the agreement , they should have no problem with the sanctions because these sanctions only kick in if they do n't comply with the agreement , " he said			2
" secondly , the president should want these sanctions as a weapon to hold over the @entity4 , so i do n't see why the president is so opposed to these sanctions			2
" a six - month agreement struck in november among the @entity72 , other world powers and @entity4 calls for @entity74 to start limiting its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled its economy			2
talks are under way on a permanent agreement , and the outcome is uncertain			0
but the @entity2 proposal would give @entity19 more than a year to engage in further diplomacy before any new sanctions would kick in against @entity4 's oil exports and other key areas of its economy			1
sanctions would hit sooner if @entity4 cheats on the interim deal or fails to reach a final accord			0
lawmakers demand a permanent global agreement that results in " termination of @entity4 's nuclear weapons program " and prevents it from achieving such capability in the future			0
the @entity19 administration has said the centerpiece of its policy is for @entity4 to not achieve a nuclear weapon			1
the @entity72 and other western powers believe @entity4 is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment			0
but @entity74 says its nuclear intentions are peaceful			0
the proposal has the support of more than a quarter of the @entity2			0
the @entity23 approved a new @entity4 sanctions bill in july , well before the diplomatic effort yielded the interim agreement			1
@entity0 's @entity112 contributed to this report .			0

bipartisan proposal considers diplomatic effort under way around @entity4 nuclear issue
legislation would give president @entity19 more time to pursue diplomacy
sanctions would kick in early if @entity4 violates current international nuclear deal
the @entity19 administration does n't want sanctions bill ; threatens veto
