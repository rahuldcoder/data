-- a death row prisoner in @entity3 has not proven his innocence , a federal court ruled , according to papers released tuesday			0
@entity7 faces execution for the killing of a @entity11 , @entity3 , police officer in 1989			1
he has always said he did not kill officer @entity12			0
the @entity13 granted a stay of execution for him two hours before he was set to die in 2008 , and another federal court later granted him another stay as he fought to overturn his conviction			1
the @entity13 last year ordered a lower court to look at the evidence again			2
but the @entity23 for the @entity24 has now found @entity7 has not exonerated himself			2
" mr. @entity7 vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence			1
... some of the evidence is not credible and would be disregarded by a reasonable juror			2
... other evidence that mr. @entity7 brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors , " the court found			1
@entity7 can still appeal to the 11th @entity34 , and if that fails , to the @entity13 again			2
his sister , @entity36 , said tuesday afternoon she had not yet had a chance to discuss the decision with @entity7 , who is sitting on death row at @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity3			1
she spoke to him a couple of days ago , she said , but they did not discuss the impending decision			0
" of course , we 're very disappointed , " she said			0
" @entity45 's innocent , so we 're going to keep fighting			1
we 're going to appeal this decision			0
" she said she and the lawyers were still reading the court 's decision , so she was n't prepared to discuss the next step in her brother 's defense strategy			2
witnesses claimed @entity7 , then 19 , and two others were harassing a homeless man in a @entity60 restaurant parking lot when the off - duty officer arrived to help the man			1
witnesses testified at trial that @entity7 then shot @entity12 twice and fled			1
but since his 1991 conviction , seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony			1
no physical evidence was presented linking @entity7 to the killing of the policeman			1
@entity13 @entity72 ordered a federal judge in august 2009 to " receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at trial clearly establishes petitioner 's innocence			1
" @entity72 , who has since retired , said the risk of putting a potentially innocent man to death " provides adequate justification " for another evidentiary hearing			0
@entity7 ' case has had a dramatic series of ups and downs			2
he was granted a stay of execution by the @entity13 two hours before he was to be put to death			0
a month later the justices reversed course and allowed the execution to proceed , but a federal appeals court then issued another stay			2
@entity7 filed an " original writ of habeas corpus , " which allowed him to bypass lower federal courts and make his appeal directly to the high court			1
what 's unusual about @entity7 ' case is that such action is hardly ever successful			1
the @entity13 often discourages claimants from maneuvering around the lower courts whose job it is to handle such appeals			0
in his dissent , justice @entity109 noted that the @entity13 had not granted similar relief " in nearly 50 years			0
" in june 2009 , @entity7 supporters delivered petitions bearing about 60,000 signatures to @entity115 , @entity3 , district attorney @entity116 , calling for a new trial			2
@entity116 is the county 's first @entity119 district attorney			0
the @entity121 held closed - door hearings and reinterviewed the witnesses and @entity7 himself in 2008			1
the panel decided against clemency			0
prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group @entity129 have asked @entity3 to grant @entity7 a new trial			0
@entity131 has also backed a new trial for @entity7			0
other supporters include celebrities @entity134 and @entity136 ; world leaders such as former president @entity138 and former archbishop @entity139 ; and former and current @entity142 lawmakers @entity140 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
@entity0 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
