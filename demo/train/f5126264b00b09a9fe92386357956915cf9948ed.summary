-- he was the so - called " fastest man on no legs , " and his inspiring story captured the imagination of the world at the @entity5			1
now , @entity7 is playing the lead role in a more tragic tale that began in the early hours of @entity10 2013			1
the @entity12 and @entity13 sprinter is facing a maximum five - year prison sentence after he was found guilty of the negligent killing of his girlfriend @entity16 on february 14 , 2013			1
he claimed he mistook @entity16 for an intruder and was cleared of murder			0
despite a seven - month trial , much remains in question about what happened at his upmarket home in @entity24 , @entity25 around 4 a.m. that thursday morning , leaving stunned fans at a loss to explain how their hero could have fallen so far and so fast			1
speaking to @entity0 's @entity29 in the last few weeks before his sentencing , @entity7 told her that he would respect and accept the decision of the court and that he was not afraid of imprisonment			1
he said he hoped to contribute while in prison by teaching people how to read or start a gym or running club			2
but it may prove to be the greatest challenge yet for a man who 's already overcome many difficulties			0
born with a congenital abnormality , @entity7 , 27 , had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday , but through sheer determination carved out a career in world - class athletics			1
in 2012 , he became the first double amputee to compete against able - bodied runners at the @entity5 , adding to his fame as the " @entity7 , " a reference to his carbon fiber prosthetic legs			1
while he failed to win a medal , @entity7 ' presence on the track was hailed as a triumph over adversity and a victory over critics who claimed his blades gave him an unfair advantage over the able - bodied			1
he did take home medals from the @entity65			0
for many , he was an example of what could be achieved through a potent mix of determination , positivity and skill			0
who is @entity7 , really ? soon after his arrest , the athlete 's image was pulled from billboards across @entity25			1
sponsors suspended their deals as admirers questioned whether @entity7 ' sporting successes had perhaps obscured a more complex character off the track			1
was @entity7 violent ? on the edge ? in a story titled " the @entity86 of @entity7 " published in the @entity87 , writer @entity84 wrote : " @entity7 is , as well , blessed with an uncommon temperament -- a fierce , even frenzied need to take on the world at maximum speed and with minimum caution			1
" after the shooting , a police spokeswoman said there had been " previous incidents " at @entity7 ' home , including " allegations of a domestic nature , " but did not say what they had been			1
besides the five - year prison term for culpable homicide , the athlete was also given a three - year sentence , suspended for five years , on a weapons charge stemming from an incident in which he discharged a loaded firearm in a restaurant			2
the sprinter moved into his uncle @entity114 's house in @entity24 after the shooting			0
@entity116 surfaced last june of @entity7 training , but he has not returned to the track in an official capacity			1
in an exclusive interview last summer , @entity120 said his nephew was heartbroken			2

" it was known that @entity7 owned guns			1
he was a keen shooter and despite his disability he was not afraid to take risks			0
during a visit to @entity7 ' house a few years ago , he showed @entity0 images of himself water - skiing , scuba diving and quad bike riding			1
" i grew up in a family where disability was never an issue			0
we did n't really speak about my disability , not because it was a topic that was taboo ... it was just never an issue			0
and that 's the mentality that i 've had , " @entity7 told @entity0 in late 2012			1
from a young age , @entity7 dedicated himself to being the best he could be at sport			1
" i was never much of an academic at school so i had to find something which i enjoyed			0
i started sports and from a very young age , my mother said to us ' sports is not about being the best , but it 's about giving your best			1
' divided reaction support from @entity7 ' family has been firm and unwavering since @entity16 's death			1
" we have no doubt there is no substance to the allegation and that the @entity171 's own case , including its own forensic evidence , strongly refutes any possibility of a premeditated murder or indeed any murder at all , " said @entity120 before the athlete 's conviction			0
addressing reporters after the sentencing , @entity120 again criticized the state prosecution for pursuing the murder charge , saying that as a result " the truth became totally irrelevant to the state 's attempt to to make the premeditated murder stick			0
" he said the 20 months since @entity16 's death had been harrowing for both families and @entity7 -- and had left everyone emotionally drained and exhausted			1
" as an uncle , " he said , " i hope @entity7 will start his own healing process as he walks down the path of restoration			2
" as a family we are ready to support and guide @entity7 as he serves his sentence			2
" @entity7 ' agent , @entity194 , referred to the sprinter as his " friend and a great professional athlete			2
" he said thousands of people had sent messages of support from all over the world in the wake of the shooting			2
@entity16 's family is skeptical about the man who killed their daughter			0
her father @entity208 told the @entity210 - language newspaper @entity209 : " it does n't matter how rich [ @entity7 ] is ... and how good his legal team is			1
he needs to live with himself if he lets his legal team lie for him			0
" read more : @entity7 ' affidavit to court in full " but if he 's telling the truth , i may forgive him one day , " he said			2
but '' if it did n't happen as he described it , he should suffer			0
and he will suffer ... only he knows			0
" at the supermarket down the road from his house , parking attendant @entity219 told @entity0 last february that he saw @entity120 and @entity16 a few days before the shooting : " they were holding hands and looked so happy			0
" another , @entity227 , described @entity7 as " a very generous man			2
" " he tipped us $ 10 every time			0
the only reason i never went to bed hungry was because of @entity7			2
" growing up as a child , @entity7 competed in water polo , cricket , tennis , triathlons and @entity12 wrestling and boxing , before he smashed his knee while playing rugby at the age of 16			1
he took up track running as part of his rehabilitation , and within one year he was covering 100 meters faster than the existing @entity13 world record			2
in 2004 , @entity7 took his first gold at the @entity248 and one year later competed against able - bodied @entity5 for the first time , at the @entity250			1
@entity7 ' career on the track suffered a setback in 2009 when he suffered serious head injuries in a boating accident			2
it took him almost eight weeks to recover , a period of time the athlete has described as " fairly difficult " as it marked the first season in four or five years in which he did n't record a personal best			0
soon after the @entity5 , @entity7 led his national team onto the track as @entity25 flag - bearer in the opening ceremony of the @entity65			1
he went on to set a new world record in the 200 - meter event but later suffered a shock defeat in the final , his first competitive loss over the distance in nine years			0
during the very last track event of the @entity248 , @entity7 again picked himself up and smashed the 400 - meter @entity13 record in a time of 46.68 to take gold			1
it ended a summer he later described as " a dream come true , " according to his website			1
beyond the track @entity7 ' determination to succeed made him one of the world 's most recognizable athletes			2

when asked about his thoughts on being a role model , @entity7 told @entity0 before the shooting : " i think it 's a massive blessing			1
" obviously , being an international sportsman , there 's a lot of responsibility that comes with that			0
so having to remember that there are kids out there , especially , that look up to you is definitely something that you need to keep at the back of your mind			0
" @entity7 has more than 300,000 followers on @entity309 , tens of thousands of whom added in the days since his arrest last year			2
his account laid dormant for a year until the anniversary of @entity16 's death in february , when he tweeted a link to " a few words from my heart " on his website			0
the message said : " no words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved -- and continues to love @entity16			0
the pain and sadness -- especially for @entity16 's parents , family and friends consumes me with sorrow			0
