-- it has been five years since @entity2 left @entity3 to train as a doctor in @entity5			1
he 's big on hockey			0
he 's devoted to the @entity7			0
he 's immersed in @entity8 , yet his heart is with @entity3 and the @entity3 people			1
it 's hell inside @entity3			1
but for @entity13 and other @entity3 expatriates who want to end the regime of @entity16 , this is a kind of golden moment			1
ethnic and religious and political divisions are melting away to serve one shimmering goal			2
" i ca n't tell you how many wonderful @entity3 i have met here who 've devoted their money and time to see a democratic , free @entity3 , " said @entity13 , whose last name is being withheld by @entity0 to protect his brother and parents in @entity3			1
" you see the @entity29 , the @entity30 , the nonreligious people ; you see people from different ethnic backgrounds : @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
" an underground newspaper in @entity3 recently published an essay of @entity2 's			2
in it , he wrote , " the revolution has brought us together , and we had scattered in loneliness			0
" for @entity2 and many other @entity3 expatriates , there is no going back to the old @entity3			1
for them , @entity3 has to change			2
" these are people who 've been exposed to the @entity8 culture and brought up in an environment -- even in @entity3 -- where there was @entity51 and dishes and satellites and they can see how the rest of the world lives , " said @entity54 , a @entity55 - based doctor with the @entity56			1
while the expat group has members in other @entity62 countries and in @entity63 , @entity54 estimated that a majority of the 600 or so members are young doctors in the @entity8 -- ironic , because @entity16 himself has a medical degree			1
the group supports an end to @entity16 's regime , though it does n't act as a political opposition entity			1
members raise money to buy food and medicine for @entity3 caught in the violence , and they speak in public about what 's going on in @entity3			1
cancer researcher @entity79 recently spoke to a group of high - school students in @entity82 , @entity83			0
when one of the students asked how he reacts to the latest videos coming out of @entity3 , @entity79 said he does n't watch anymore			2
he explained why by describing the last video he watched from @entity3			2
someone recorded @entity3 soldiers invading a house looking for the husband of the household			2
when they did n't find him , @entity79 said , they cut off the head of his young son , hung it in the doorway and told his wife , " this is what will happen to your husband if he does n't turn himself in			0
" last may , @entity79 's brother , a doctor in @entity3 , was arrested and killed -- his body mutilated -- after he returned from a trip to the @entity8			1
a few expatriates in the @entity8 are part of the @entity109 , the group that many @entity3 consider to be the official political opposition			1
one of them is @entity112 , a cancer specialist who teaches and practices at @entity113 in @entity114			0
@entity112 , who is @entity29 by birth , said he joined the opposition group " to show it 's really the entire spectrum of the @entity3 people fighting the regime : @entity29 , @entity122 , poor , rich , educated and noneducated ... we wanted to burst that bubble they 're trying to depict that it 's only armed radicals or armed gangs			1
" in @entity5 , @entity2 said he was going to anti-al - @entity16 rallies even before the @entity3 secret police , the @entity128 , arrested his brother who was protesting in @entity3			1
@entity2 said the police kept his brother locked up for three months			0
he said they interrogated him and tortured him from day one			0
( listen to @entity13 read his brother 's essay about that time ) after three months , the police let @entity13 's brother go to make room for a wave of new prisoners			0
but as soon as he was freed , he returned to protesting			0
@entity2 said he would not tell his brother to stop protesting			0
if he were in @entity3 now , he said , he would do the same thing			2
" this is not only an uprising , " he said			0
" it 's an epic , a human epic that 's being written by the @entity3 people			0
