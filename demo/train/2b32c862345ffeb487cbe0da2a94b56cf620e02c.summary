@entity0 and her daughter @entity1 had planned their cruise for half a year			0
they would sail on the @entity6 cruise ship and celebrate @entity1 's birthday			1
it was the trip of a lifetime			0
that is , until they awoke to a fire alarm , smoke in their hallway and then days and days of misery			0
human waste was actually piling up in bags just outside their door			0
" just on our deck alone , there were the biohazard bags lined up across the floor , " @entity0 said			0
" we 're talking about raw sewage at just the end of our deck alone			0
" it was a nightmare , @entity0 said			0
now the nightmare has been made worse , she said , because of company documents that have just come to light			0
the cruise line 's own reports , inspections and maintenance records detail a problem that had been developing on the @entity6 more than a year before @entity0 and her daughter were on board			1
exclusive documents obtained by @entity39 now reveal the fiasco on the @entity6 as a disaster waiting to happen			1
more than 4,000 passengers and crew members were stranded aboard what 's now known as the " poop cruise " after a fire knocked out the ship 's power			1
the ship drifted four days before it could be towed into @entity50 , @entity51 -- the whole time without air conditioning , and largely without lights , water , food and working toilets			2
@entity39 has learned that the crew of the @entity6 set sail in february with only four of six generators fully operational , knowing that the company had an ongoing generator fire hazard in ships across its fleet , including @entity6			1
@entity65 attorney @entity64 represents the @entity0 family and several dozen other passengers from the ill - fated @entity6 who have filed suit against @entity70			1
" that ship never should have set sail in february , " @entity64 said			2
" it was unseaworthy at the commencement of the voyage			0
these documents tell you that the company -- and i 'm saying to you the corporation back in @entity81 -- had knowledge of the fact that this vessel had a propensity for fires ; that there were things that could have been , should have been , and were n't done in order to make sure that fires did n't take place			0
" the first trouble with @entity6 was in diesel generator no. 6 -- the one that wound up catching fire			1
starting more than a year before the infamous cruise , that generator was overdue for maintenance , often not in compliance with the safety laws of the sea , known as @entity101 , according to the ship 's engineer			0
read the document about the generator ( @entity106 ) over and over again , @entity6 's own maintenance reports stated the same thing : diesel generator @entity109 was overdue for maintenance			2
the company says the fire that originated with the generator was not connected to the lack of maintenance			0
but , during that same time period , @entity6 learned about another , even more alarming safety problem in the engine room : fuel lines			1
a dangerous pattern of leaks had emerged on other @entity6 cruise ships , according to the company 's documents			1
in fact , @entity6 's @entity126 caught fire in the @entity129 in february 2012 because fuel leaked onto a hot spot and ignited			1
that fire left the ship without power for three days in tropical heat of nearly 100 degrees @entity136			1
@entity6 's advisory notice ( @entity106 ) that would be eerily similar to what started the fire on board the @entity6 one year later			1
carnival says it proactively began investigating after the @entity126 fire and found a big problem in a different type of fuel line			1
there had been nine incidents resulting in fuel leaks associated with flexible fuel lines in just two years			0
spate of fires pose problem for cruise industry on january 2 , @entity6 issued a compliance order , giving ships two months to address the problem to " ensure a suitable spray shield ... is installed " for all diesel engines using the flexible fuel lines			1
" after that internal study , the company came out with a new policy to , again , shield all the flanges and the hoses , " said @entity159 , @entity70 vice president of technical operations			0
but @entity6 did not in fact shield the part of the one hose that wound up causing the tragedy on board the @entity6 in february			1
" that hose was beneath the deck plates , and it was believed the deck plates would provide that shield , " @entity159 said			0
" in this case , it ( the fuel leak ) found that gap in the hose ... in the bilge plates and caused the fire			2
" on february 7 -- with a diesel generator still in need of overhaul and fuel line shields on some , but not all , of its flexible hoses -- @entity6 set sail from @entity185			1
three days later , off the coast of @entity188 , a fire broke out in diesel generator no. 6 when fuel sprayed from a flexible fuel line , even though that fuel line was only six months old			1
" we were totally in compliance ... with all the rules and regulations , " @entity159 said			0
" we had ... our regulating bodies on board the ship less than two weeks prior that had certified the ship to sail			0
obviously , you learn things on a situation , on an incident such as the @entity6			2
" those regulating bodies included the @entity206 and @entity208 's insurance			2
while @entity70 insists that what happened on the @entity6 was just an accident , the company has dedicated $ 300 million in a fleet - wide safety upgrade , focusing on detecting and preventing any potential fire hazards in its engine rooms			1
the company also points out to the passengers suing that the cruise line never promised a safe trip			2
@entity6 's court filing says the " ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage , a seaworthy vessel , adequate and wholesome food , and sanitary and safe living conditions			2
" since the @entity6 fire , @entity6 says it has instituted a 110 % money - back " @entity229 " on its cruises			2
fraction of cruise ship crimes are made public			0

an engine room fire left the @entity6 *adrift* in february
passengers reported *overflowing* toilets and other *unsanitary* conditions
documents show spray shields were not installed on a fuel line that leaked
despite that , the @entity206 *approved* the ship for sailing
