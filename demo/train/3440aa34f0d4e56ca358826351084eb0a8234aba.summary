that most everyone agrees upon : it is a game changer			1
the background : a game changer by @entity13 after decades of conflicting and increasingly convoluted decisions on the use of race as a criterion for university admissions , the @entity14 ruled tuesday that the citizens of @entity21 could constitutionally ban the use of race and other criteria in the selection of students			1
for some , the court affirmed the right to establish a colorblind selection process			0
for others , the court engaged in an act of willful blindness to the racial realities of society			0
the court has been struggling in this area for decades			0
in 1977 , in @entity39 , the court allowed only a limited use of race for the purpose of achieving " diversity " in classes			0
the @entity45 at the @entity46 set aside 16 of the 100 seats for minorities			0
the court ruled it unconstitutional but was deeply divided on why -- a harbinger for the line of cases that would follow @entity53			0
the court spent nearly the next 40 years spinning on the ice of affirmative action , unable to get traction or a clear direction			1
the court 's split decision in 2003 is illustrative			0
it was presented with two cases involving the use of race as a criterion in the undergraduate and the law school admissions processes at @entity68			2
in one case , @entity70 , the court voted 6 - 3 that the university violated equal protection in the selection of students based on race and other criteria			1
it then ruled 5 - 4 , in @entity79 , to uphold race criteria in the admissions process for @entity82			0
however , associate justice @entity83 stressed that the court " expects that 25 years from now , the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today			0
" @entity83 's statement was ridiculed by many ( including some on the court ) , but seemed to capture the fluidity of the court 's position on the use of race			0
in 2013 , the court again seemed to produce a nuanced and uncertain decision in @entity98 , where the court rejected a lower court decision upholding the use of race in admissions at the @entity104			0
however , it did not prohibit the use of race but rather sent back the case for the imposition of a more demanding test of " strict scrutiny			2
" these cases offered little hope that a " bright line " could be reached to bring resolution of the issue and meant that the court would continue to referee such matters			2
that line , however , may now have been reached in @entity4			0
@entity21 voters responded to the divided results in the @entity79 and @entity70 cases to bring their own clarity to the area			1
they passed a constitutional amendment that required an entirely colorblind process for selection at state schools ( as well as barring schools from giving an advantage to some students based on other immutable characteristics like gender )			1
by a vote of 6 - 2 , the court ruled this week that citizens could do precisely that			0
in so ruling , the court for the first time created an avenue that could end this longstanding controversy by vote of citizens			2
seven states have already passed such rules , and this decision is likely to encourage others to follow			0
in my seminar on the @entity148 and the @entity14 , my students and i debate leading cases each term and voted both on the merits and on our prediction as to the outcome in that " other " court			1
so , in our recent vote , the @entity157 voted overwhelmingly , 11 - 4 , to reverse the @entity159 and allow @entity21 voters to make such a decision			1
the class also predicted the result in the case -- again by an 11 - 4 vote			2
here are two of our " gw justices " who viewed the case in manifestly different ways : @entity170 : ruling reflects ' sad history ' of racial hurdles by @entity174 the importance of the court 's decision is amplified by our sad history of placing hurdles to bar minorities from meaningful participation in the political process			1
race - conscious policies , by the court 's own admission , are highly controversial and should be confronted in the political process through healthy debate			2
however , the debate means little if no real action can be taken to implement what was decided through that debate			1
the @entity191 already contained a process for deciding university admissions policies			0
@entity21 residents had ample voice through elections to choose members of a board that were an integral part of this process			1
if the board members were not advancing the will of the people , residents could have made their voices heard through elections			2
this switch from a highly accessible and accountable board to a state constitutional amendment is an impermissible restructuring of the political process which will only serve to cripple the effectiveness of public debate and severely disadvantage the minority			1
by adopting a change on a state constitutional level , the issue is further removed from the hands of the people			1
even assuming that a healthy debate will take place , the decision places a significant hurdle in the way of any concrete action			1
this decision goes against clearly established @entity14 precedent that it is unconstitutional to inhibit meaningful access to the political process for minorities			0
the @entity14 plays a special role in our system			0
it must uphold constitutional rights , especially in the face of majority rule where that majority seeks to take a voice away from the minority			0
for : @entity14 should not undo the will of the people by @entity243 the political process yields favorable and unfavorable results			1
as long as the government does not interfere with the right to participate in the process , and as long as the results of that process are constitutional , the courts can not take power from voters and undo the will of the people			2
the @entity14 made clear that @entity4 was not about the constitutional validity of affirmative action programs			1
instead , the case was about whether @entity21 's constitutional amendment barring affirmative action interfered with the right to participate in the political process			1
the court correctly ruled that the process functioned properly			0
what did that process entail ? @entity21 's @entity266 , a statewide referendum , was approved by 58 % of @entity21 voters			1
the amendment the voters passed does not restrict speech , deny voting rights , or impose majoritarian barriers designed to prevent the minority from achieving its goals			2
in other words , the amendment does not interfere with the political process			2
voters are not silenced , the issues are not censored , and the debate surrounding affirmative action is not over			1
if the role of the court is to perfect democracy , then the court fulfilled its role in not overturning @entity21 's amendment			1
a ruling to the contrary would undermine democracy by removing this debate from the public sphere and leaving its resolution in the hands of nine unelected judges			1
some may disagree with @entity21 's amendment			1
that is to be expected and encouraged			0
the political process is always ongoing and perhaps the issue will be revisited			2
in the meantime , the debate will continue , ideas will be shared , and the political process will march forward			0
join us on @entity304 / @entity303 .			0

@entity13 and his law students debate the ruling in the @entity21 affirmative action case
@entity174 argues the amendment takes the issue out of the hands of the people
@entity243 counters that the will of the voters should not be ignored
but all agree : the ruling is a game changer
