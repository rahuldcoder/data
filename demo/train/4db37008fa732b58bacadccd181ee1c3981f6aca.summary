-- for the sorcerers who practice the dark arts of politics , the hot summer months are generally known for their focus on triviality , hyperbole and petty posturing			0
this " silly season " is marked mostly by frivolous debates over manufactured controversies as voters tune out and cook out in parks and backyards across the country			0
so it comes as no surprise that the latest bit of feigned outrage to embroil the @entity20 involves an interoffice newsletter recommending that employees consider taking a modest stab at common sense			1
joining the ranks of thousands of companies , restaurants , schools , average @entity29 and @entity30 , a recent newsletter from the @entity20 made a humble suggestion for its employees to reduce their environmental footprints : consider eating a meat - free lunch once per week			1
the agency was referring to " @entity37 , " a project of @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity42 universities and supported by many other health - related organizations			0
after angry press releases from the meat industry and outraged tweets from @entity49 in @entity50 , a @entity20 spokeswoman announced the agency does not endorse the " @entity37 " initiative and said the suggestion was posted on the agency 's website " without proper clearance			1
" problem solved , i guess			0
but the rationale behind an idea like " @entity37 " is crystal clear			0
it 's exactly the kind of step @entity20 should be endorsing			1
the reality is that it takes massive amounts of land , water , fertilizer , oil and other resources to produce meat , significantly more than it requires to grow other nutritious and delicious kinds of food			1
because meat production is so resource intensive , livestock farming actually accounts for 18 % of global greenhouse gas emissions			2
cattle farming alone consumes nearly 8 % of global human water use			0
my own organization , @entity81 , an international relief and development organization , recently endorsed the idea of eating less meat and dairy as part of our grow campaign to fight global hunger			1
we did a study and found that if a family of four decided to swap burgers or other beef for lentils just one meal a week , they could save about @entity102 - size swimming pools of fresh water over the course of a year			1
if that seems like an astronomically large amount of water for such a small change , it 's because it is			1
meatless mondays might seem like an unlikely cause for a humanitarian organization to champion			0
but @entity81 is working on this issue because as diets around the world change and the population swells to 9 billion over the coming decades , our planet will need to produce up to 70 % more food even as we use fewer resources			1
if we do n't reduce our environmental footprints as we increase production , poor people , particularly women , will be the first to suffer			0
eating less meat is a simple way to reduce the pressure on global resources and help ensure that everyone has enough to eat			1
to say it simply , eating less meat helps fight hunger			2
the meat industry would argue that eating less meat would damage the bottom line of @entity29 farmers			1
but farmers are already struggling just to keep up with the spiking global demand for meat , which experts predict could nearly double by 2050			0
eating less meat could help slow this unsustainable increase , but @entity29 farms wo n't suffer as a result			2
swapping out meat just once per week would also help reduce the emissions that are contributing to climate change and extreme weather			2
farmers across the @entity29 are facing the worst drought in a generation , leading the @entity20 to declare 1,369 counties in 31 states as disaster areas			2
the weather has caused massive crop failures , driving a significant spike in the price of corn			0
while it may be hard to know exactly what role climate change has played in causing the drought , there is no doubt that these kinds of events are exactly what we expect to experience more frequently and with greater severity because of the changing climate			0
our study looked at what would happen if urban and suburban households in just four countries -- the @entity29 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 -- decided to swap beef for lentils just once a week			0
we found that the emissions reductions from this tiny step alone would be the equivalent of taking 3.7 million cars off the road for a year			0
sadly , facts like these are not enough to avoid the silly season altogether , or to persuade the @entity20 to ignore the self - serving indignation of the meat industry and keep a reasonable suggestion on its site			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

@entity20 's newsletter suggesting employees forgo meat once a week causes *uproar*
@entity189 : meat industry , politicians slam @entity20 , so it backs off
it takes huge amounts of land , water , fertilizer , oil to produce meat , he writes
he says eating less meat reduces use of resources and ensures everyone gets fed
