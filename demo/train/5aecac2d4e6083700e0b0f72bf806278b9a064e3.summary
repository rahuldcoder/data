the @entity0 is set to hold urgent talks over the future of the @entity3 following the @entity5 ' exorbitant cost			1
the 2014 event in @entity7 cost an estimated $ 50 billion and @entity0 members are concerned that candidates will be frightened off applying to host the @entity10			1
earlier this month , @entity11 withdrew its candidature to host the @entity10 , while @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 have also pulled out of the running			0
@entity17 , president of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) and an influential member of the @entity0 , says the entire bidding process and cost of the @entity10 needs to be addressed when the governing body meets in @entity23 next month			1
" we 'll have an extraordinary @entity0 session in december , " @entity17 told @entity24 , referring to the @entity0 meeting on december 8 and 9			1
" we have to change a lot of things , the whole bidding process will be changed			0
" the costs for organizers will change to a certain extent			0
the @entity0 will give them additional financial support			2
" reflecting on @entity37 's cost , @entity17 admitted the @entity38 had created a perception that hosting a major event was prohibitively expensive			2
" @entity7 did what we did in our ski resorts in 150 years in five years , that of course costs money			0
" and then they did it in the @entity7 way , as big and as beautiful as possible			0
but more than 5 $ 0 billion was just too much , there 's no question			0
" there are currently just two cities vying to host the @entity10 -- @entity53 and @entity54 , @entity55			2
earlier this month , @entity56 , president of the @entity0 , said there would be a proposal to " change the philosophy of the bidding " for future editions of the @entity10			1
@entity56 said the @entity0 wants to address the issue of reducing the cost of the @entity10			2
" we see with the 2022 bids that we are living in a time of world crisis , financial crisis and that there are of course -- and that is legitimate -- more questions being asked by the people about the financing of the @entity10			0
" the next @entity3 takes place in @entity75 , @entity76 , in 2018 .			1
