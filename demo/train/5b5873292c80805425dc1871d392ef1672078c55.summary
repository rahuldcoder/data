@entity0 -- @entity2 adjourned for the summer on thursday without passing a relief package for farmers and ranchers suffering through the most widespread drought since the 1930s			1
the only thing the @entity10 - controlled @entity9 and the @entity12 - controlled @entity11 have agreed on is that they 'll take the issue up again after @entity15			1
" we need drought assistance , but instead we 're just going to sit here in gridlock , " said @entity16 , executive vice president of the @entity17			2
" it 's kind of disappointing			0
" little hope for worsening drought in @entity25 most farmers devastated by the drought are getting help from federally assisted insurance policies			2
but a number of livestock producers are in serious trouble			0
why ? a decision by @entity2 four years ago to pass a five - year farm bill that eliminated key federal livestock support programs in 2012 instead of 2013			1
@entity2 " had it expire because they wanted the gimmick to keep the cost of the last farm bill down , " said @entity36 , vice president of the group @entity37			1
now , in the midst of a brutal drought , " it turned around and really bit them in the behind			2
" feeling pressure to do something before leaving @entity0 for the summer , @entity9 @entity10 leaders managed to pass a narrowly tailored $ 383 million disaster relief bill restoring expired programs for livestock , certain trees , honeybees and farm - raised fish			1
the measure , funded by cutting spending on conservation programs , passed in a 223 - 197 vote			1
thirty - five @entity62 backed the measure , while 46 @entity10 opposed it			1
rank - and - file @entity62 were quick to note that @entity9 @entity10 came to power in the 2010 election promising reform , not fast fixes			1
more @entity2 : @entity2 closes loophole in stock trading law after @entity1 report " you want to hand ( money ) out to whoever comes to town and begs for it , go right ahead , " said rep. @entity72 , @entity73			2
" i have some rooftop terrace restaurants in my district			0
give them some while you 're at it			0
that 's not a solution ( to ) the underlying problem			0
" in june , the @entity11 passed a comprehensive new five - year farm bill renewing the livestock programs in question while cutting the deficit by roughly $ 23 billion			1
the bill cuts the deficit through reforms such as the replacement of direct payments to farmers with more taxpayer - subsidized crop insurance for farmers in need			1
the measure passed in a rare bipartisan 64 - 35 vote			2
the @entity9 @entity10 , however , remains sharply split on the merits of such a bill			1
a similar multiyear measure passed the @entity104 but has since stalled			0
some tea party conservatives want to cut spending more deeply , while a number of @entity108 -- fearing political vulnerability and constituent pressure -- continue to push hard for immediate federal relief for livestock producers			0
@entity113 : drought has made more than half of @entity25 counties disaster zones " our livestock guys take just as much risk as any other farmer or rancher out there , and they need to have some kind of protection in situations like these , " freshman rep. @entity117 , @entity118 , told @entity1			0
" we ca n't gamble with people 's lives and businesses			0
" speaker @entity132 , @entity133 , admitted this week that " the @entity9 is pretty well divided " on the issue			1
" frankly , " he told reporters , " i have n't seen ( a majority of ) 218 votes in the middle to pass a farm bill			0
" @entity62 , with the backing of groups such as the @entity17 , have shown little willingness to adopt the narrower @entity9 plan and abandon their multiyear farm measure			2
" if we get out in the real world , that 's not what we 're hearing from farmers and ranchers , " said @entity146 chairwoman @entity145 , @entity147			0
" they want us to get our job done			0
they want a five - year farm bill			1
they want us to address disaster assistance			0
i intend to do both			0
" livestock producers caught in a @entity164 crunch stressing the need to provide " long - term certainty , " @entity145 urged the @entity9 to pass a full farm bill and work out its differences with the @entity11			1
she blasted @entity9 @entity10 for " trying to play politics			1
" for their part , consumers can count on rising food prices next year if @entity2 does nothing , @entity16 told @entity1			2
he urged the @entity9 to adopt a plan similar to the @entity11 's			1
the @entity9 approach is to " kick the can " down the road , he said			2
" it 's not how business should be conducted ... it 's very shortsighted			0
" complete coverage : @entity25 drought			0

@entity2 went into summer recess without agreement on a drought relief package
the @entity12 - controlled @entity11 passed a five - year plan with several reforms
the @entity10 - controlled @entity9 passed a more narrowly tailored bill to restore a few expired programs
@entity2 will take the issue up again when it *reconvenes* in *september*
