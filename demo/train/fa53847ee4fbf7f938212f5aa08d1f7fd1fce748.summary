industry is doing more to improve working conditions than @entity2			1
" of course , when it comes to issues of corporate responsibility , talk is cheap			0
what matters is not what @entity2 says , but what it does			2
and what @entity2 does in its vast global supply chain has been well - documented , which is why the company is in public relations overdrive , frantic to protect its once pristine corporate image			1
consider the fate that befell workers at a factory in @entity25 , @entity26 , that makes products for @entity2			2
in may , independent investigators issued a report documenting grave dangers to workers at the facility			0
they warned the factory was failing to control the profusion of dust produced by the manufacture of aluminum cases for the @entity38			0
when a factory is suffused with aluminum dust , there is a high risk of explosion			0
@entity2 ignored the report and refused to meet with the authors , the investigators said			2
it did nothing to address the danger			0
two weeks later , the factory exploded , killing four workers and injuring 18			0
in the wake of the explosion , @entity2 said its suppliers took measures to control aluminum dust			2
but despite this , in december 2011 , another explosion , at an @entity2 supplier factory in @entity58 , injured 61 workers			2
grievous labor rights problems at @entity2 's supplier factories have been known for years , including the spate of worker suicides in 2010 at the giant plant in @entity66 , @entity26 , known as " @entity67			1
" at this factory -- owned , like the @entity25 plant , by @entity2 's biggest supplier , @entity67 -- more than a dozen workers took their own lives by throwing themselves from the roof of the factory 's overcrowded dormitories , in apparent protest of the brutal treatment facing workers at the facility			1
( @entity67 reportedly responded by putting up nets outside the dorms and making workers sign pledges not to kill themselves			0
) in recent weeks , public awareness of these issues has increased exponentially , thanks to a huge jump in media interest , raising @entity2 's public relations problems from a low simmer to a rolling boil			1
when a company comes under this kind of pressure , sometimes genuine change in policy can occur			0
the more typical response is a mere change in rhetoric			0
this is the route @entity2 is choosing			2
@entity2 's major move has been to announce that it has joined an organization called the @entity102 , which will " audit " @entity2 's factories			1
according to @entity2 , the @entity102 is an independent watchdog that will work tenaciously to hold @entity2 and its suppliers accountable			1
unfortunately , while there are some fine people at the association , the organization is not the independent watchdog @entity2 claims it to be			1
indeed , most of its money -- millions of dollars per year -- comes from the very companies whose labor practices it is supposed to scrutinize			1
although @entity2 has not disclosed its financial relationship with the @entity102 , it is likely now the organization 's largest funder			1
moreover , on the association 's board of directors sit executives of major corporations such as @entity122 , @entity123 and agribusiness giant @entity124			0
the job of these executives is to represent the interests of other member companies , such as @entity2			0
under the @entity102 's rules , the company representatives on the board exercise veto power over major decisions			2
@entity135 , as most people understand the term , means an organization is not funded and governed by the companies it is charged with investigating			0
despite the financial relationship , @entity2 argues that the @entity102 will act independently and that the association 's review of @entity2 's factories will probably be " the most detailed factory audit in the history of mass manufacturing			1
" early indications are not encouraging			0
just one day after launching what was supposed to be a long and uncompromising investigation of @entity67 's @entity151 plant in @entity66 , the association was already issuing public praise of @entity67 and @entity2			2
on wednesday , @entity155 / @entity154 ran an article with the headline , " @entity151 plant is ' way , way above average , ' says inspector			0
" @entity102 president @entity161 said this about @entity67 to @entity163 : " the facilities are first - class			0
... i was very surprised when i walked in the door how tranquil it is			0
... " the @entity155 / @entity154 article notes that " whether intended or not , van @entity161 's remarks served to support ( @entity2 ceo ) @entity1 's contention that no one has done more than @entity2 to address the working conditions at factories			2
" @entity175 reached these conclusions after a guided tour of the factory provided by @entity67 's owner , @entity179			0
the views of @entity179 , one of the wealthiest men in @entity182 , are well - known to @entity67 workers because , as punishment for displeasing their managers , workers are sometimes forced to spend hours writing out copies of his personal sayings			0
clearly , @entity2 's partnership with the @entity102 is not , in and of itself , going to usher in radical change			1
so what steps would @entity2 take if it were genuinely committed to improving its labor practices ? for starters , it would open its factories for inspection and worker trainings to genuinely independent groups such as @entity200 - based @entity199 , the organization whose report on the @entity25 factory could have saved the lives of the workers killed there in may , had @entity2 paid it heed			1
and if @entity2 genuinely " cared about every worker , " it would pay every worker a living wage -- enough for workers to achieve a minimally decent standard of living , support their families and even save a bit toward a better future			1
today , barely 1 % of the retail price of an @entity151 goes to the workers who make it ; 33 % goes to @entity2 's profits			1
@entity2 's profits are so high , and its global labor costs so low , that it could triple the wages of its 700,000 manufacturing workers and help them achieve a living wage ( just a few dollars an hour in @entity26 ) , and still make $ 40 billion a year			1
a wage increase of 16 % to 25 % at @entity67 , announced today as @entity2 's public relations blitz reaches a crescendo , does n't come close			1
next time you are at the @entity227 , consider bellying up to the @entity228 and asking why the most profitable company in the history of technology ca n't pay its workers a living wage and why , if @entity2 is really ready to open itself to independent scrutiny , it does n't allow inspections by organizations in which it is not a dues - paying member			1
