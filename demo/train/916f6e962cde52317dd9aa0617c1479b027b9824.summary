he is the ultimate challenge on grass courts			0
" @entity1 is bidding to become the first man since @entity3 in 2007 to retain the @entity2 title , and also add to his @entity93 success earlier this year			1
@entity94 kept fans on @entity64 on tenterhooks for nearly four hours before he got past @entity97 seventh seed @entity96			0
@entity96 took a set lead and was a break up in the second before his @entity102 opponent established a toehold in the match			0
he trailed 5 - 2 in the second set tiebreaker before hitting back to level and moved ahead when he took the third set			0
a brief rain delay halted play at 5 - 5 in the fourth set before fourth seed @entity30 returned to win the match 6 - 7 7 - 6 6 - 4 7 - 6			1
it will be his fourth @entity2 straight semifinal , bidding to become the first @entity32 player to win a grand slam since @entity115 in 1936			2
@entity33 will provide stiff opposition but he was extended by @entity12 @entity117 in their clash on @entity47			2
after dropping the second set , @entity33 , who beat @entity3 in the quarterfinals last year , emerged a 7 - 6 4 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 2 winner .			1
