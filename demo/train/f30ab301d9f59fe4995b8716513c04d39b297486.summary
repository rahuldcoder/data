-- even the most sordid situations can have a silver lining			2
the @entity5 - @entity4 relationship may serve as a cautionary tale for any health care provider who works with celebrities			1
regardless of whether you agree with the verdict on @entity4 , who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter monday in @entity5 's death , there is little doubt that what served as " health care " for @entity5 would hardly meet quality standards , and some would characterize it as drug dealing			1
that all sorts of boundaries between patient and physician were crossed can hardly be disputed			2
what is it about caring for celebrities that causes professionals to lower their standards and often enable unhealthy behaviors ? there are several factors : -- health care providers are no different from anyone else			1
we live in a celebrity culture where the well - known are held in high regard , regardless of the nature of their talents			2
while often the interest is prurient , the curiosity surrounding these individuals can cause otherwise normal acting professionals to act in an unprofessional manner			2
-- celebrities are often narcissistic , demanding people who may make unreasonable demands on providers who may be intimidated or in awe of them			1
-- incurring the favoritism of a celebrity can increase the profile of a health care provider , leading to more " business " and more celebrity interactions from the friends and family of the celebrity			2
-- the world that celebrities live in scarcely resembles the world most of us inhabit			1
they have private jets , personal shoppers , instant gratification for every need and the adoration of the public			2
it is hard not to be seduced by this " @entity75 " world			0
many providers are thrilled to be included in the celebrity posse			0
-- quite simply , celebrities can offer money to those who can meet their demands , however unreasonable			1
-- which one of us would not want to be a fly on the wall witnessing the public adoration and posh lifestyle of the rich and famous ? reality shows are hugely popular just for this reason ( along with their train wreck appeal )			0
becoming a contracted health care provider , such as @entity4 was for @entity5 , allows the provider to accompany the celebrity on this magic carpet ride			1
-- it is hard to say " no " to a celebrity who has never been denied			0
most health professionals would swear they do not alter their standard of care for " special " patients and insist they treat all patients the same , without regard to status			0
in the main , i would agree this is the case			1
however , i have noticed in many different health care settings that when a celebrity is involved , waiting times are shortened , scarce specialty appointments are miraculously found , staff is just a little more polite and solicitous , and the entire unwieldy health care process is a little more user friendly			0
there are practical reasons for a health care institution to go out of its way for a celebrity : it is good public relations			0
celebrity endorsement of a doctor or hospital can help with image , fundraising and standing in the community			0
with the strict @entity131 guidelines protecting patient privacy , the public should never be aware of which doctor or institution is caring for a patient			0
however , the celebrity may choose to reveal this information out of gratitude			0
celebrities can be wonderful partners in raising awareness for a disease or condition			1
many choose to lend their drawing power to fundraising galas for disease research			0
there is , however , a clear line between facilitating a specialty visit for a celebrity and prescribing large amounts of unwarranted painkillers or sleeping medications			0
the boundary violations seen in @entity4 's case are so egregious that it boggles the mind			1
very few providers have succumbed to celebrity neediness to this extent			0
a good outcome from this tragic tale would be a reminder to all care providers not to be seduced by the promise of @entity167 into the world of the rich and famous			1
maintaining the same standard of care and caring for all patients , regardless of stature in life , is something we all profess but may need to be reminded to uphold			0
celebrities should not get less care or more care or different care or even , heaven forbid , the crazy , diabolical pimping that goes on in these selective circles			2
being an enabler for a celebrity , whether it be " overcare , " extortionist care ( $ 100,000 a month ? ) or drug dealing is wrong			1
hopefully , this @entity5 - @entity4 chapter is closed ; the cautionary tale has been written			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			1

@entity190 says @entity4 verdict a cautionary tale for docs who work with celebrities
she asks : why does dealing with celebrities make doctors lower standards ?
she says doctors *dazzled* by *glamor* , money , access , like everyone else
@entity190 : being an enabler for a celeb is wrong ; hopefully case is reminder of *dangers*
