-- @entity1 will come a little late for some this year , thanks to @entity3 , but in areas of @entity5 that did n't take a major beating , revelers and trick - or - treaters were eager to celebrate after days of being cooped up inside			1
the situation is still dire in many parts of the @entity11 , including @entity12 , where neighborhoods are littered with debris from shattered homes , downed trees and power lines			2
citing safety concerns , gov. @entity18 signed an executive order wednesday postponing @entity1			0
" i 've taken this action to minimize additional risks to lives and the public safety as we begin the process of rebuilding and recovering from @entity3 , " @entity18 said			0
" in too many communities in our state , the damage and losses from this storm are still being sorted out , and dangerous conditions abound even as our emergency management and response officials continue their work			0
" elsewhere , residents in parts of @entity5 , @entity39 and @entity40 were asked to hold off on trick - or - treating			1
parades were postponed or canceled , including @entity5 's annual @entity43 , which the mayor 's @entity44 and the @entity46 canceled for the first time in 39 years			1
but that did n't stop celebrations altogether for residents of @entity5 's outer boroughs who had planned on attending the @entity43			1
hallow - meme costumes take off " we were already planning on having a party			2
but now that nobody can get into @entity65 we are really having a party , " said @entity57 resident @entity56 , who invited friends to enjoy electricity and running water in the office of his online marketing agency in @entity63 wednesday night			0
" people need something to do , " he said			0
" everyone has been cooped up inside for the past four days , and nobody has anywhere to go or anything to do , so why not provide them with some fun celebratory festivities ! " in @entity57 's @entity77 neighborhood , @entity75 took pictures of trick - or - treaters walking around storm detritus			1
" even though most of @entity5 is still paralyzed and without electricity , the spirit of @entity1 is alive and well , " he said			1
on @entity5 's @entity85 , costumed children and parents also had to avoid downed trees and store awnings surrounded by yellow caution tape as they searched for @entity1 treats , which were in short supply			1
in some high - rise buildings that had power , the tradition of apartment trick - or - treating continued if residents could find candy			1
" on the one hand , the kids and parents were so happy to be outside and have some semblance of @entity1 celebration , " said @entity97 , who lives on the @entity85			1
" what was striking was that the stores did not have any decorations , or had tape and boards over the front windows			0
half of them are still closed down			0
and the half that were open were almost all out of candy			2
" an undercurrent of guilt pervaded the festive atmosphere , she said , because revelers knew that residents of lower @entity65 , much of which was still without power and littered with storm damage , could not participate			0
with several cities along the @entity11 experiencing power outages , information was hard to come by , leaving many to improvise or source information through social media			0
@entity127 of @entity128 , @entity5 , posted updates on @entity130 to alert friends who did n't have power in their homes but could check their smartphones			1
the town of @entity136 , where she lives , asked residents to postpone trick - or - treating until saturday , and a parade in nearby @entity141 was canceled			1
@entity1 facts and figures instead , the married mother of five brought her kids to @entity147 , where parents met in a school parking lot for a " trunk or treat , " she said			1
they lined up their cars next to each other with trunks open to display big bowls of candy			2
the kids went from car to car scooping up treats before hitting the playground			2
while the kids got to expel pent up energy from being housebound , parents were able to commiserate , she said			1
they shared stories of losing roofs and exchanged information about school openings , upcoming games and where to find gas or bread			2
" it was endearing and heartwarming to see a town coming together in this moment			0
it brought lightness to what was a dark situation , " she said			0
elsewhere , the change in routine brought neighbors together as they 've been forced to improvise			0
for @entity183 and her family in @entity185 , @entity12 , that meant @entity1 actually arrived a little early this year			0
her 13 - floor , 70 - unit apartment building was still without power tuesday and surrounded by a couple of feet of water			2
" our building is full of bored trapped kids , " she said			2
to keep them busy , everyone gathered in the lobby and played board games on tuesday			0
later in the day , the children dressed up in their costumes and went trick - or - treating in the building , she said			1
" some of the families had not gotten a chance to get candy so they improvised , " she said in a @entity130 message			1
because she 's been home for four days , @entity208 , who normally works full time , finally met her neighbors in @entity212 after living in her building for a year and a half			1
thanks to one mother in the building -- " there 's always one mom who organizes for all the other mommies , " said @entity208 -- families have been taking turns hosting events and gatherings so the load is spread out among several families			1
since monday , there have been group playdates , a pancake party , movie sessions and even ( this being @entity5 ) a yoga class			1
" because of the nature of my job , i have not been around very much , so it 's great to meet the other mommies , " said @entity231			2
" it 's taken me a year and a half and a hurricane , " she said			0
" they said , ' we never even knew you actually had a kid			0
' " did you celebrate @entity1 in spite of @entity3 or were you forced to postpone festivities ? share your experiences in the comments section below			0
