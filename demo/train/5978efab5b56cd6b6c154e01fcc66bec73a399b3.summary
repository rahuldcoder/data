@entity11 , also a neighbor , had been babysitting the boy in her @entity13 home , she said			1

the boy , now 8 , was in good physical condition monday and was in the custody of @entity16 , said sheriff 's chief deputy @entity17			1

@entity11 was arrested monday in connection with the boy 's kidnapping after @entity16 began investigating her in august on allegations of negligently supervising her children and an unknown 8 - year - old child who had been physically abused , @entity18 said			1
in an interview wednesday , @entity7 expressed joy and disbelief that @entity10 , the youngest of her five children at the time of his disappearance , had been finally found			0
authorities did not give details about who was taking care of the boy when he was found			2
when @entity7 received a phone call monday from the child welfare agency , " i kind of had to look at the phone -- was this real ? " said the mother , who had a sixth child after her son 's disappearance			2
she wondered if authorities ' call was a cruel joke , she said			0
she was asked about the disappearance of her son and his connection to @entity11 , she said			2
" at first , it kind of scared me , " she said			0
she was thinking about her son in recent days because his birthday was march 1			0
the child protection agency told @entity7 that @entity11 had been arrested in east @entity3 , but that her son was not with @entity11 at the time , the mother said			1
@entity7 will undergo a blood test possibly this week to prove she is the biological mother , she said			2
on the night that her son and @entity11 disappeared , @entity7 said she had asked @entity11 to watch her son overnight			2
at the time , the mother had five children , all under age 4 , and @entity10 was the youngest			2
" i was having hardship at the time , " the mother said			2
" i asked her to watch him overnight , and when i came back ... they were gone			0
" @entity11 and the mother lived in the same apartment building , and @entity11 wanted the boy to stay in her apartment and the other kids to stay at another friend 's apartment , the mother said			1
@entity11 was a high school student at the time and had to attend classes the next morning , but when @entity7 went to pick up her son that morning , he and @entity85 were gone , @entity7 said			2
@entity11 's mother said the two had left the state , @entity7 said			1
she called police , she said			0
the mother knew @entity11 and her family well , and they spent a lot of time together , she said			1
" at that time , i trusted her , i knew her , " @entity7 said			0
police asked her to take a polygraph and she agreed , but because she was pregnant at the time police told her she could not take it then , @entity7 said			0
she never knew police had closed the case back in 2006 , and she assumed all along they were still working on it , she said			2
she called @entity101 several times to check on the case over the years and was always told she had a new police contact and the case had been assigned to someone else , the mother said			1
she found the experience frustrating and had not called back in a while , she said			0
still , she thought often of her son , she said			0
" i always wondered every night			0
i dreamed and prayed on it , " she said			0
she explained @entity10 's disappearance to his siblings " the best i could , " she said			0
" they still somewhat do n't understand the situation , why ( someone ) would do that , " @entity7 said			0
her children now " are trying to make sure i stay calm " and are " praying with me , " the mom said			0
@entity10 could be returned to her " by the end of the week , " she said			0
" i 'm going to let him know i love him with all my heart ... and any questions he has , i will answer them , " @entity7 said			0
" it will be hard			0
" " we will probably have to go to a psychiatrist together , " she said , adding it will also be opportunity to work out their relationship and get to know one another			0
when asked how she felt about how @entity13 police handled the case , she said , " it took years to get some sort of progress			1
this took years ... a lot of running around and nobody helping me			0
" the boy was reported missing in november 2004 , and after an investigation , @entity13 police presented the case to the @entity144 district attorney 's office for review in february 2005 , @entity18 said			1
the prosecutor accepted the case , but a warrant was never issued because the prosecutor 's office apparently asked for clarification of the precise date when the boy was taken , @entity18 said			1
@entity13 police was unable to clarify that information , and the case was closed in 2006 , @entity18 said			1
an @entity155 was never issued for the boy because the @entity156 was never notified , said coordinator @entity157			1
@entity160 investigators are now looking into the case , including why an @entity155 was never requested , spokesman @entity158 said wednesday			1
in august 2011 , the state child welfare agency received a report against @entity11 about alleged negligence of her children , @entity18 said			1
an 8 - year - old boy was reportedly " hit on , " @entity18 said			2
the report did n't suggest the alleged negligence was egregious , but the child welfare authority initiated an investigation and attempted to identify the 8 - year - old child in the report , @entity18 said			2
@entity11 allegedly gave the child welfare agency 's investigators contradictory information about the 8 - year - old boy , saying the child was hers and then was n't hers , that the child belonged to her brother or someone else , @entity18 said			1
the state agency then called the sheriff 's office , which eventually opened a criminal investigation in january after authorities could n't find the child , @entity18 said			0
@entity11 again allegedly provided misleading information to the sheriff 's investigators , @entity18 said			1
the child welfare agency then provided sheriff 's investigators with a possible identity of the missing child , and @entity1 prosecutors secured a warrant for @entity11 , @entity18 said			1
" we interviewed her again ( wednesday ) and she provided additional information , " @entity18 said			0
" she admitted that she provided misleading information , which certainly supports our belief that she kidnapped the child			0
