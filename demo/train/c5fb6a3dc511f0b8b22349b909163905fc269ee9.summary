-- a few months before her second birthday , a small bump about the size of a pimple appeared on @entity7 's right leg			2
her parents , @entity9 and @entity10 , noticed the boil in the evening , as they prepared their daughter for bed			1
" we had already been through this three other times , so we were n't too worried , " explains @entity10 , who says she had taken her daughter to a pediatrician on several occasions to treat skin infections			2
as they usually did when a little red circle with a white head appeared on their toddler 's body , they popped it like a pimple and cleaned the area with antibacterial soap			0
but this time , that small pimple would turn into a major problem			0
" by the next morning , it was n't just a bump anymore			0
her leg was red and extremely swollen , and she could hardly walk			0
she was in pain , and her fever had spiked to 103 , " her mother recalls			0
" it went from minor to really , really bad overnight			0
" by 10:30 that morning , they had rushed @entity7 to their pediatrician in @entity42 , @entity43			0
she was hospitalized , and the @entity44 learned their daughter had developed methicillin - resistant @entity45 , or @entity46 , which is a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments			1
this type of infection has been a problem in hospital settings for many years , but starting around 2000 , it began steadily making its way into the lives of otherwise healthy people , especially children , who are not typically at risk for the fast - moving bacteria			1
as children head back to school , epidemiologists are encouraging parents to be more aware of the drug - resistant strain of staph and how to protect their kids			1
mrsa infections on the rise " everyone is at risk , " said dr. @entity67 , senior author of a new report that found the number of children hospitalized with @entity46 infections , mostly acquired from within the community , has more than doubled since 2000			1
" @entity46 really started as a bacterium that was seen in hospitals among high - risk patients			1
but during the last decade , we saw it spread to the general population			0
" " the problem is that @entity46 began to affect people who were perfectly healthy , " adds dr. @entity81 , author of a 2005 study that concluded that infections in children had reached " epidemic proportions			1
" mutations in the organism made it more virulent and easy to transmit , he says			0
" we continue to see more severe , life - threatening infections affecting the blood , lungs , muscles and even bones of previously healthy children			2
" in 2009 , 71,900 children were hospitalized because of infections under the skin , according to the @entity100 , and the @entity101 estimates there are approximately 10,800 deaths in the @entity104 each year caused by staph , of which 5,500 are inked to @entity46			1
the problem became so widespread that in january , the @entity107 called the condition a " huge public health problem " and published its first - ever guidelines for the treatment of @entity46 in pediatric patients			1
protecting your child from @entity46 " we have to live with the fact that it 's out there , all around us in the community			1
at this point , we expect a certain level of these infections , " @entity67 says			0
" now , it 's a matter of recognizing the early signs and treating it early when we see it			0
" @entity7 spent three days in a hospital and recovered without serious complication from her @entity46 infection			1
her parents say their previous experience has made them more cognizant of every little bump on their daughter			2
and because their daughter is prone to skin infections , they are even more vigilant about hygiene in their household			0
" we learned that the hard way , how quickly they can progress			0
the longer we can go without them , the better , " her mother says			0
as children head back to school , pediatricians are encouraging parents to become educated about @entity46 to ensure that if their child gets an infection , they catch it early , before symptoms become severe			1
here are 5 things parents should know : 1			2
the infection site can resemble a spider bite " sometimes , parents mistake [ a @entity46 infection ] for a spider bite because it is so intense and appears so suddenly , " said @entity81 , a pediatric infectious disease expert at @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity155			1
" if you have n't seen a spider , do n't assume it 's a spider bite			1
if you recognize a painful red spot with a little bit of pus , that 's enough of a concern to go to a doctor , " he recommends			0
to help you identify the infections , the @entity101 has compiled several images to better visualize what @entity46 infections may look like			1
the infection may start like a pimple and advance rapidly dr. @entity175 , an @entity176 pediatrician , says parents often do n't realize how quickly the infection can progress			1
" this is what shocks parents the most			2
something that looked like a pimple is all of a sudden the size of a nickel , " explains @entity175 , who says the bacteria can spread within a matter of hours			0
she once saw a patient who developed more than 30 skin boils in two to three days			0
transmission among young athletes is prevalent according to the @entity192 , skin diseases accounted for 56 % of all infectious diseases in competitive sports from 1922 through 2005			0
athletes tend to share things like equipment and towels , and children engaged in high - contacts sports inevitably receive cuts , bruises and scrapes , which act as potential entryways for serious bacterial infections			2
last year , the association issued a position statement on skin disease among athletes warning that after a bacterial infection , they should not be allowed to return to a game until they complete a 72 - hour course of antibiotic therapy and the infection has been completely drained			1
the @entity101 offers more prevention information and advice specifically for athletes on its website			0
treatment for @entity46 not always the first option @entity67 , a professor of pediatrics at the @entity223 , says that when a child has an infection , doctors do not always start with a prescription that works against @entity46 bacteria			1
in communities experiencing high mrsa rates , pediatricians may automatically default to medications that fight the bacteria , but they may choose not to in communities where there has n't been an outbreak			2
if someone in your home or another child in your child 's school recently had a @entity46 infection , alert a doctor , as it may be worth asking up front for a broader - spectrum antibiotic			1
pages 12 - 15 of the @entity248 list the treatment recommendations for adults and children based on their symptoms			2
return to the pediatrician as soon as possible if within 48 hours you do not notice less swelling or redness , or if the infected area remains warm , @entity67 advises			0
bleach baths and proper cleaning can help prevent spread if you have several children , and one of them has developed a @entity46 infection , you want to keep the spread to a minimum			1
experts say to keep the infected area covered with a bandage until it heals			0
the @entity44 took the recommendation of an infectious disease specialist and gave their daughter a bleach bath using about a half - cup of bleach in about 13 gallons of water , a few times a week			2
there is the potential for skin irritation if the mixture is not diluted properly , so be sure to follow the guidelines outlined by the @entity281			0
you 'll also want to clean surfaces that might come in contact with the infection			2
the @entity285 offers a list of registered cleaning products that are effective against @entity46 .			1

kids ' hospitalizations for community - acquired mrsa have doubled since 2000
10,800 deaths in the @entity104 each year caused by staph , of which 5,500 are linked to @entity46
