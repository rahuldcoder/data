-- the stock photo , posted on a @entity3 fan page for the accused @entity5 shooter , shows two young men in a movie theater turning around to tell the people behind them to be quiet			1
" if you do n't shut up , " it says , " we 'll @entity9 your a- -			1
" it 's not new for @entity3 pages to pop up in support of accused killers and other distasteful figures , but a few dozen @entity9 fan pages -- including one with more than 800 followers that appeared the day @entity9 is accused of opening fire on a theater in @entity23 , @entity5 , killing 12 people and wounding dozens -- are raising new questions about what constitutes free and appropriate speech in the digital age , especially on @entity3			1
the network , which has 900 million monthly active users , has long been regarded as a sort of brightly lit town square in an internet that has some dark and seedy corners			1
people must sign up for @entity3 under a real identity , so the trolling habits that anonymity seems to encourage tend to be less tolerated on @entity3 than on sites such as 4chan or even @entity41			1
still , @entity3 can be fairly lenient about what it will let people say on its network			1
the company has decided not to take down the @entity9 fan pages , although employees are monitoring them closely for types of speech that would violate the social network 's community guidelines , spokesman @entity45 said			1
the most popular page , " while incredibly distasteful , does n't violate our terms , " he said			2
for that fan site to be taken down , it would have to post " credible threats " against specific people or post something that was intended to incite violence , @entity45 said			2
@entity3 declined to comment on whether particular messages or comments on that particular page had been removed because they met either of those two criteria			1
@entity3 sometimes will remove comments , posts or photos without taking down an entire page			1
@entity45 added that the @entity9 fan pages are not representative of how @entity3 users are responding			1
he pointed to several pages where @entity3 users are rallying around the victims of the @entity5 shooting by posting memorials , messages of support and by trying to raise money for a victim who was shot and now is in an intensive care unit			1
" we are heartened that the vast majority of activity on @entity3 surrounding this tragedy has been focused on helping the community cope and beginning the healing process in the wake of these events , " the company said in an e-mailed statement			1
in the past , @entity3 has been criticized both for leaving up certain @entity3 pages and images and for taking down others			1
last year , the site sparked outrage when it removed a support page for nursing mothers because it featured breastfeeding photos , but reinstated it two days later			2
it is now part of the site 's guidelines to allow such images to be posted on the site			2
the social network in march 2011 took down a page calling for a @entity108 intifada after the @entity110 government complained			2
it left up a holocaust - denial page in 2009 , saying that " being offensive or objectionable " does not mean a site can be removed			2
at the time , @entity116 , @entity115 , attorney @entity114 urged the network to set tighter controls , saying : " there is no @entity120 right to free speech in the private realm			0
this is n't a freedom - of - speech issue			0
@entity3 is free to set the standard that they wish			1
" @entity3 's " @entity128 " document , which is posted online , addresses violent and threatening speech in this way : " safety is @entity3 's top priority			1
you may not credibly threaten to harm others , or organize acts of real - world violence			0
we remove content and may escalate to law enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm , or a direct threat to public safety			0
we also prohibit promoting , planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have , or could , result in financial harm to others , including theft and vandalism			0
" the site also does not tolerate speech that promotes self - harm , hate speech , bullying or " graphic content , " nudity or pornography , according to that online policy			0
other technology companies have become embroiled in similar debates about what is and is n't appropriate communication on online platforms			0
@entity164 is regarded as running one of the tightest ships , since it pre-approves apps that will be sold in its app store			0
it also has been criticized , however , for rejecting apps that would compete with the company 's own offerings or that it finds distasteful for one reason or another			0
in 2010 , for example , the company initially rejected an app that featured the work of a @entity180 winning political cartoonist			0
the app later was approved by @entity164 , following pad press			0
@entity184 , that technology giant 's social network , came under fire for initially requiring its users to sign in using their real names			0
some groups protested the policy , saying that political dissidents in authoritarian regimes , for example , could n't use the service without fear of violence			0
the company softened the policy in january , allowing nicknames			0
@entity200 bans users from impersonating others , infringing on trademarks , using the service unlawfully and threatening violence , according to its standards document , called " the @entity206			0
" it bans using pornographic images " in either your profile picture or user background , " but does not seem to ban users from posting links to such material			0
@entity3 is letting the @entity9 fan page saga play out			1
many users have commented that they find the page " disgusting " and " sick minded			2
" " you mock the death of these poor people ? seriously ? " one wrote			0
others are calling for @entity3 users to ignore the page in order to avoid giving it more power			1
" he 's just a troll with nothing better to do than to fish for negative attention on the internet			2
i actually feel sorry for him , " one commenter wrote			0
the page 's administrator , who has not revealed his or her identity on that fan page , does n't seem bothered			1
" whatever you have to say to me , i do n't care			0
this page is n't affected			2
( i 've been reported over like a billion times and nothing has happened ) , " the page 's administrator writes , adding : " also , i do n't believe in karma , and i do n't believe in hell			2
please keep this in mind when you post			0
unless its something smart or funny , please know ; i 'm just going to laugh at you and all you 're doing is wasting your time			0
" while the page is whipping some people into a fury , @entity249 , a professor of pop culture at @entity251 , cautioned against reading too much into a tiny piece of the internet that has little value to the larger public discourse			1
" probably the amount of attention that we give to this stuff is totally disproportionate to how most people feel , " he said by phone			0
" but because anybody with the @entity256 has got an international distribution system at their fingertips , if you start something that is a pro-mass - murderer fan page , it 's going to get the attention of people			1
" it 's understandable that people would be outraged by the @entity3 page , he said , especially since it mocks the victims of a mass murder that is not even a week old			1
but the page might be written in an ironic tone , he said , and it certainly is n't representative of mainstream views in @entity285 -- or anyone 's view , other than its creator			2
" the mistake is made when people say what does this page mean about @entity285 ? " he said , " this page does n't say thing about @entity285 , besides maybe that there are too many @entity3 pages			1
