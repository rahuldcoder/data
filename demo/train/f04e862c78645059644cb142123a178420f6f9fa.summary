-- when designer @entity2 started working at @entity3 he wanted to make a point			1
so he printed his @entity3 profile page and stretched it out in the company 's @entity7 offices			1
there it was , multiple years of his life , on a scrolling piece of paper			0
a story big enough to cross the room			0
it 's a story you 'd never see on @entity3 , he argued , since pretty much all the status updates and photos he 'd posted over the years were hidden beneath a gray button at the bottom of the page : " @entity25			1
" " all of the stories you 've shared over time just fall off a cliff at the bottom of your ( @entity3 ) wall and effectively disappear , " company ceo @entity26 said on stage at an event for @entity3 app developers in @entity31 , where this story was retold			1
that , in a nutshell , is why @entity3 on thursday unveiled a completely rethought version of its profile pages : to surface all the events and stories that are hidden from view because they happened too long ago			1
the fact that this is even something up for discussion is significant			0
@entity3 , as the @entity49 's @entity48 pointed out , is trying to be the " forever " social network			2
all its predecessors , from @entity53 to @entity54 , vanished almost as quickly as they appeared			0
now @entity3 is saying it wants to be the website where you document the most important events of your entire life , presumably from birth to death , not just this year or next			1
that 's something audacious and new in this ephemeral era of social networking			0
the vehicle for this lifelong sharing , according to @entity3 , is called " timeline			1
" " we wanted to design a place that feels like your home , " @entity26 said on stage thursday , wearing a gray t - shirt and one of those ear - clip headsets you see on @entity74 employees			1
" where you tell your story online is really personal			0
you invest a lot of time in it and you curate it			0
you link to it and you tell all your friends to find you there			0
so we wanted to make timeline a place you 're proud to call your home			1
so @entity88 is a completely new aesthetic from @entity3 ... so you can express who you really are			2
" or , more succinctly : " timeline is the story of your life , " @entity26 said			2
in the coming weeks , @entity3 is going to start replacing peoples ' profile pages with a new blog - like template , where photos and check - ins and status updates are strung along the backbone of chronology -- days , months and , here 's the big leap , years			1
the site 's users can customize this page as they 'd like , clicking a heart button to make photos appear at double their normal size , for example , or deleting catty comments from ex-boyfriends or girlfriends			2
@entity3 's robots take care of the rest			2
the site 's equations prioritize your memories , letting the stuff they determine to be insignificant fade into the recesses of time , and shining a digital light on moments they determine to be the most life - alteringly crucial			0
this goes all the way back to birth			0
when the 27 - year - old @entity26 unveiled this page design , he scrolled to the bottom of his timeline and there it was : a photo of him as a baby			1
it was as if he was hinting at a future when a person 's entire existence could be cataloged and preserved , all on @entity3			1
that sparked some chatter online			0
" so it 's easier for kids to put more of their lives online that they 'll regret later in life , " tech analyst @entity147 wrote on @entity148			0
anyone who has friends of a child - bearing age likely realizes that many kids already have @entity3 pages almost from birth -- or , at the very least , their early lives are detailed on their parents ' pages			1
timelines , which highlight all of a @entity3 user 's years , may make this even more apparent			2
furthermore , as @entity166 at the blog @entity168 says , those of us who crossed out of infancy before the dawn of @entity3 could use @entity162 to recreate our pasts on the social network : " this new format allows you to go back in time to periods in your life that happened before there was a @entity3 , making your @entity3 profile into a graphically intense version of your entire life , " he wrote			1
@entity184 called the timeline " the story of your life on a single page			2
" if you want it to be			0
@entity189 at @entity190 wrote that @entity3 users should be skeptical of this concept : " the news is n't that @entity3 has figured out a new way to package your life and present it back to you , " he wrote			1
" the news is that no one blinks at the notion of a giant company being the custodian of your memories			0
at least that 's what @entity3 is banking on			2
timeline is your life , their way			0
" that is , if you want to fill in the details			0
