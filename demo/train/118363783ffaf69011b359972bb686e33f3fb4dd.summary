-- every member of @entity2 swore an oath to preserve , protect and defend the @entity4 of the @entity5			1
but too often over the past five years , the president has circumvented the @entity5 people and their elected representatives through executive action , changing and creating his own laws , and excusing himself from enforcing statutes he is sworn to uphold -- at times even boasting about his willingness to do it , as if daring the @entity5 people to stop him			1
that 's why , later this month , we will bring legislation to the @entity20 floor that would authorize the @entity20 to file suit in an effort to compel president @entity6 to follow his oath of office and faithfully execute the laws of our country			1
the president 's response : " so sue me			2
" what 's disappointing is the president 's flippant dismissal of the @entity4 we are both sworn to defend			2
it is utterly beneath the dignity of the office			0
i know the president is frustrated			2
the @entity5 people are frustrated , too			0
@entity6 : @entity40 's lawsuit is ' a stunt ' after years of slow economic growth and high unemployment under president @entity6 , they are still asking , ' where are the jobs ? ' @entity20 has passed more than 40 jobs bills that would help			1
but @entity50 @entity49 , led by the president , just ignore them			2
even worse , the president 's habit of ignoring the law as written hurts our economy and jobs even more			0
@entity50 taxes and regulations always make it harder for private sector employers to meet payrolls , invest in new initiatives and create jobs -- but how can those employers plan , invest and grow when the laws are changing on the president 's whim at any moment ? i do n't take the @entity20 legal action against the president lightly			2
we 've passed legislation to address this problem ( twice ) , but @entity76 @entity49 , characteristically , have ignored it			0
in the end , the @entity4 makes it clear that the president 's job is to faithfully execute the laws			1
and , in my view , the president has not faithfully executed the laws when it comes to a range of issues , including his health care law , energy regulations , foreign policy and education			1
@entity40 plans lawsuit against @entity6 over executive orders there must be accountability			1
we have a system of government outlined in our constitution with the executive branch , the legislative branch , and the judicial branch			0
@entity2 has its job to do , and so does the president			1
when there are conflicts like this -- between the legislative branch and the executive branch -- it is my view that it is our responsibility to stand up for this institution in which we serve , and for the @entity4			0
if you look back over @entity5 history , there has always been a tension between the inherent powers of the executive branch versus the inherent powers of the legislative branch			0
this issue is as old as @entity122 vs. @entity123 and as fresh as the unanimous @entity125 ruling last week that the president overstepped his authority on recess appointments			0
over the last five years , starting -- not coincidentally -- when his political party lost the majority in the @entity20 , the president has consistently overstepped his authority under the @entity4 , and in so doing eroded the power of the legislative branch			0
the legislative branch has an obligation to defend the rights and responsibilities of the @entity5 people , and @entity5 's constitutional balance of powers -- before it is too late			0
opinion : dear speaker @entity40 : do your job instead opinion : @entity146 left @entity6 no choice but to act on immigration join us on @entity151 / @entity150 .			1
