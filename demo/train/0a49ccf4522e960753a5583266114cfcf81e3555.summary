-- if travel industry experts are correct , next year will see us snapping holiday " braggies , " eating dinner at a local 's house , being served by a " @entity7 " and , more than likely , heading to @entity3			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are among top destination picks for next year , while world - class sports events like the @entity14 will also see fans flocking to host nation @entity16			1
why @entity3 's hot right now " one of the hottest regions is @entity3 and there are a couple of different drivers , " says @entity18 , president of global travel provider @entity19 , which serves 40,000 travel agents worldwide			1
@entity10 , notoriously expensive for foreign visitors , is set to become more affordable because of the depreciation of the yen , which has lost nearly a quarter of its value since 2012			2
" international currencies are going to go a lot farther , " says @entity18			2
she points to increased interest in @entity33 , " the @entity34 of @entity10 , " a string of islands in the south with a subtropical climate and a strong indigenous culture			2
@entity9 is expected to bounce back from a coup in may , which hit tourism hard with unrest and curfews			2
" there 's a lot of pent up demand , " says @entity18 , adding that in spite of the recent negative headlines tourists are likely to stream back to @entity9 for great food and glorious beaches			2
meanwhile , @entity8 will celebrate its 50th anniversary of independence in 2015 , making it a big draw for visitors			2
famed for its eclectic cuisine , soaring skyscrapers -- and , more recently , ambitions to transform itself into a city in a garden starting with the 100 - hectare @entity64 -- @entity8 is putting on a number of events to celebrate its @entity67			2
highlights include the opening of the @entity8 and the opening of the @entity71 , which will cover historic locations on the island			2
" it 's our top destination for 2015 globally , " says @entity18			2
instant messaging , wearable tech , robots @entity79 continues to drive the future of travel and it 's shaping everything from the way we show off about our holidays with " braggies , " like a selfie , but taken within 10 minutes of arriving at your hotel			1
it 's also changing who brings us room service ( clue : it might not be a human )			0
" technology is the strongest disruptive force in the travel industry today , " says @entity95 , travel and tourism analyst at @entity98			1
he 's one of the editors of the annual @entity103 2014 , released at last month 's @entity104 in @entity105			0
one of the most surprising predictions in the report comes out of @entity3 , where millions of people now make travel bookings via instant messaging			0
@entity112 messaging service @entity111 has 440 million active users -- second only to @entity117 messaging service @entity115 -- but it 's leading the way when it comes to monetizing its popularity			0
@entity112 online travel agency @entity122 sells air , train and other tickets on @entity111 , while travelers on low - cost carrier @entity128 book flights and check in using its @entity111 service			1
" instant messaging is becoming a threat to telecoms companies -- and also for social media , " says @entity95			0
" we definitely expect this to become the case in more and more other regions of the world			0
" the report predicts that wearable tech ( @entity143 - connected devices that you wear ) will be an increasingly important tool for travelers over the next couple of years			1
products currently on sale include the @entity151 and @entity152			0
but it 's the @entity154 , which goes on sale in 2015 , that 's expected to be the real game changer			0
@entity157 , which owns the @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity161 hotels and several other global brands , is getting ahead of the trend with an @entity154 and @entity165 app that allows hotel guests to unlock their hotel rooms without a key card			1
perhaps taking all this to its logical extreme , @entity172 , also part of the @entity174 , is trialing a robot butler , known as " @entity176 " in @entity177 , @entity178			1
" @entity176 brings you things you need , for example toothpaste , your slippers , a newspaper , " says @entity179 , head of travel and tourism for @entity98			1
cruise line @entity187 installed robot bartenders on its new @entity190 , which it says is the world 's most technologically advanced cruise ship			1
however , technicians had to pull to plug on them on the inaugural voyage after they failed to stand glasses upright and mix cocktails fast enough , according to the @entity197			0
" at some point the introduction of tech has to be functional , not just novelty , and there 's a danger that hospitality goes toward gimmick , " says @entity179			0
do - it - yourself holidays and the sharing economy in 2015 , more of us will likely book our own holidays , use online forums to research destinations and rent from locals when we get there			1
" we are seeing more and more people move away from the model of getting a package holiday , " says @entity213 , spokesperson for online booking and review company , @entity215			0
the company announced in august 2014 that 315 million people now use the site each month -- an increase of 20 % from 2013			0
increasing numbers of people are using @entity215 's forums to research destinations in advance , taking the opportunity to ask locals specific questions			1
" they will take time to put the pieces of a trip together , because they figure they can get better value for money on it and also find those local gems , " @entity230 adds			0
the sharing economy , particularly peer - to - peer rentals and experiences , is gaining popularity at warp speed			0
poster child of the movement , holiday rentals site @entity250 currently has 6 million guests in 190 countries			0
some of that growth has come from word - of - mouth , according to @entity98 's @entity179			0
" people might have been hesitant but then they hear of ( others ) who have had a positive experience -- or not -- and they are more inclined to try it out , " she says			0
hanging with the locals what we 're all likely to be doing a lot more next year is eating with the locals -- not in restaurants but in their homes , according to the @entity103 2014			1
sites like @entity267 , which pairs travelers with home cooks and @entity270 , a network of locals who offer meals and cooking classes , are rapidly expanding			1
" my best travel experiences have always involved having a local person on the ground , so i set out to launch a platform where travelers could connect with local people , " says @entity270 founder @entity275 in the report			1
both @entity270 and @entity283 apply the @entity250 model to dining : guests review hosts and some are verified for food quality , venue and cleanliness			0
peer - to - peer sites that offer experiences , like @entity294 , are also popping up			0
@entity295 connects travelers with locals offering everything from a night photography tour of @entity300 to kayaking in @entity301 to a tour of @entity303 , @entity304 's largest slum			1
services like these are forecast to become some of the fastest growing areas in the travel industry over the next few years , fueled by the public 's appetite for authentic experiences and connections with local people .			1

" @entity319 " are just like selfies , but taken within 10 minutes of arriving at your hotel
travelers will be eating more meals *alongside* locals , say industry *insiders*
