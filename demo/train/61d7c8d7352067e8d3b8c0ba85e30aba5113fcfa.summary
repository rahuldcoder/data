-- close your eyes and imagine this			2
it is the 1930s and , as @entity6 starts to flex its muscles in @entity8 , you are in the @entity9 bouncing along a rough road on your way to visit an archaeological dig. the excavation is taking place on @entity15 , fabled site of the @entity17 's burning altar , and archaeologists are digging deep to uncover the roots of humanity in the region			1
so far , so @entity22			2
except that when you arrive and walk through the tented camp to the trenches , you realize that almost every single person -- from the @entity27 excavators and overseers , to the @entity30 team directing the project -- is a woman			1
because this is n't a feminist fantasy -- this is @entity35 's excavation project at the @entity36 , and it 's the reality			1
if you are surprised , i do n't blame you			0
i felt much the same when i dug deeper into the story of a hero of mine , the pioneering palaeontologist @entity40			0
between 1901 and 1905 , totally unchaperoned , the twenty - something year - old @entity40 explored the cliffs , caves and mountains of @entity45 and @entity46 in search of fossils			1
she was phenomenally successful , with her fossil finds becoming an important part of the collection at @entity53 's @entity52 that i now work on			0
to do all of this as a woman in the early 1900s , i thought , she must have been truly extraordinary			0
daring , clever , courageous and pioneering , yes -- but extraordinary ? it seems not			0
at the same time as @entity40 was exploring @entity46 , an archaeologist named @entity59 was directing the excavations of the @entity62 town of @entity63			1
with her were two more women , @entity65 and @entity66			1
this image of not one , but four @entity70 women , digging for fossils and @entity62 potsherds during the turbulent early days of @entity46 surprised and captivated me			2
so i did the obvious thing and tweeted about it			0
i was totally unprepared for what followed			0
i was bombarded with more examples of pioneering women archaeologists : @entity35 , who we met above ; cross-dressing @entity80 ; @entity82 , spy and mentor to @entity84 ; the explorer and painter of @entity88 ruins , @entity89 ; @entity90 , excavator of @entity92 ; @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 ( yes , that one ) , @entity100 -- the names just kept on coming , and as they did my delight turned to indignation			1
why had n't i heard of these women ? not the individual names -- i can barely name any male archaeologists from that period -- but the idea of these women , working in such numbers and even leading their fields			2
it was as though we 'd blithely wiped them all from our popular imaginations , and thus allowed each woman to be easily dismissed -- albeit with an approving pat on the head -- as anachronistic and an exception - to - the - masculine - rule			2
as the names of pioneering women archaeologists bounced around my corner of the @entity121 , so too did demands for more information , for television programs ( which do n't exist ) and books ( which do )			2
these women 's lives were packed full of adventure , tales of derring - do and breathtaking discovery , and together they subvert an idea of femininity that persists to this day			1
so when @entity136 suggested i start a @entity137 to do just that , i punched the air and the simple brilliance of the idea			0
yes ! but there was no way i could do it on my own			0
fortunately , much as @entity40 was n't alone in @entity46 in 1903 , i was not alone in the wild frontiers of social media			0
@entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 -- all , like me , in the early stages of their scientific careers -- immediately stepped up			0
in the space of just a few hours , four women who barely knew each other outside the realm of @entity157 , had signed away their free time to start a blog celebrating pioneering women in archaeology , palaeontology and geology			1
@entity166 is now just over one month old and we already have over twenty posts online , and more submitted , written by people who want share their admiration for the women who inspired them			1
and we have a lively -- and lovely -- @entity157 feed and @entity173 page , where hundreds of people join in funny , joyous , free - flowing conversations , celebrating these women , sharing fieldwork stories , and forging new friendships and networks in the process			1
we 're planning @entity181 as part of @entity183 , and stepping in wherever we think a trowelblazing opinion is needed			0
and we want everyone to join in			0
we dare to dream that @entity166 will help to reset people 's imaginations -- for it to become as normal to imagine @entity82 as it is @entity188			1
for @entity35 to trump @entity22			1
we want to ask children to draw us pictures of palaeontologists and geologists and archaeologists , and we want those pictures to be of women as often as they men			2
because this is n't political correctness , and this is n't fiction -- though the stories are great			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			1

archaeologist @entity35 led an excavation in 1930s with all - female team
@entity210 *dr.* @entity205 was so inspired , she *co-founded* blog @entity166
