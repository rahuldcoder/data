-- a decade - long civil war wrecked @entity3 's economy , but now a juice business could provide a blueprint of how to add value to the country 's exports			1
although the civil war in @entity3 ended nine years ago , it is only now that the country 's first significant value - added export has emerged			1
@entity14 @entity13 produces juice concentrate from mango and pineapple farmed throughout @entity3 and exports it internationally			2
the company is working from a special economic zone , in the form of a 54 - acre low - tax industrial park , built just outside of the capital @entity23			1
it is designed to attract foreign interest and although similar zones exist in other parts of @entity14 , this project is a first for @entity3			2
the zone was set up by @entity30 -- a commercial subsidiary of the @entity31			0
first step discovered that many farmers in @entity3 struggle to turn their fresh produce into money and that a lot of fruit ends up unsold or left rotting on the ground			2
@entity3 's deputy minister of information @entity46 admits : " we have fruits like mangos , pineapples all over the country , but they are being wasted , and there is not much value added to these resources			1
" @entity30 's industrial park is intended to house factories that can process @entity3 's natural resources , rather than simply exporting them			1
@entity55 , @entity30 's ceo , sees the industrial park as a logical solution to help develop new business in the country			0
he says : " we 're just making it possible for businesses to easily establish and employ people to start processing resources locally instead of what always happens in @entity14 , which is , it 's seen as a source of natural resources			1
" natural resources are dug up , brought some place else , cut down or taken out of the water , and processed and sent back to @entity14 or other places in the world , when the real value addition is , where jobs are created , where income is created -- where an economy can really find its engine			1
" there are stringent selection criteria for potential tenants to obtain a plot in the industrial park			0
" there has to be a commitment to not only the financial bottom line , " says @entity84			0
" we 're looking for tenants that also are passionate and care about their impact in terms of social impact and environmental impact			0
" @entity14 @entity93 is now the first tenant and enjoys a three - year tax holiday , along with security , electricity and water supplies			1
majority - owned by @entity30 , @entity99 was founded by @entity100			0
its mission is , " to become a pioneer and leader in the @entity105 tropical fruit juice concentrate market in the @entity106			0
" it pays farmers about $ 250 to $ 300 for each tree harvest --- a substantial jump from the $ 15 they would get at the local market			0
@entity14 @entity13 eventually plans to directly employ close to 100 @entity3 and provide a market for nearly 1,000 small farmers throughout the country			2
" we 're targeting the fair - trade niche of the business , obviously , because @entity3 has a difficult past , " says @entity100			2
" a fruit juice coming from @entity3 , we think , will have a very good impact into @entity123 consumers that can now choose something tangible coming from a place that they were thinking is only war , famine and death , " he added			2
although special economic zones have been successful in @entity132 , some analysts have voiced concern that they wo n't work in countries without a well - developed labor force or infrastructure			1
but with @entity14 @entity13 up and running , and farmers receiving increased profits , the success of the project has not gone unnoticed			0
" first step is doing something that is historic , is unheard of in contemporary history in our country , " says @entity46			0
" and they 're changing the lives of people in the sense that they can see development taking place in our own lifetime			0
" he says he hopes @entity155 and the special economic zone will act as a catalyst for potential investors , demonstrating that , " we have created an enabling environment for companies to come in and do their business without hindrance			1

special economic zone is a first for @entity3
it is intended to house factories that can process @entity3 's natural resources
