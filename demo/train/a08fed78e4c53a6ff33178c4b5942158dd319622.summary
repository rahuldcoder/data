-- think of @entity1 and for most people what comes to mind is a city of damaged buildings and concrete checkpoints			1
this is what @entity9 expected the first time she visited the @entity13 capital just months after the @entity15 - led invasion in 2003			2
@entity1 has a history dating back to ancient @entity17 and was later one of @entity20 's great capitals			2
but @entity22 's closed regime left the modern city unknown to the outside world			1
" i had no idea what to expect , but had heard that the modern city had nothing to offer , " said @entity9			2
she was astonished to find a city that she fell in love with			2
and , surprisingly , what most enthralled her was @entity1 's 20th century architecture , including buildings commissioned by @entity22			1
" despite the dust and the traces of looting , despite the @entity41 and the disorder , i fell in love with the modern city , " said @entity9 , now head of the @entity34 at the @entity35 of the @entity36 in @entity37			1
" i discovered the garden city , the beautiful architecture , the lovely houses with central courtyards and roof terraces , the people who were welcoming to foreigners			1
" in the 20th century , @entity1 managed to mix traditional features , methods of building and details of decor with modernity			1
" @entity57 has been used in @entity13 for 5,000 years , and gives features that you do n't see in @entity60 or @entity61			2
" @entity9 was so captivated that she wrote a phd on the 20th century architecture of @entity1 and later a book called " @entity65 , " published last year			1
the architectural boom continued under the dictatorship of @entity22 , who ruled from 1979 until he was removed by the invasion in 2003 , said @entity9			1
also on inside the @entity69 : @entity71 women : pampered or oppressed ? " of course there was great architecture built under @entity22 , " she said			1
" he was really fond of architecture , and i could even say that it 's a cliche that many dictators were ... see what @entity79 or @entity80 commissioned			2
" but he was not very consistent in his choices			0
he happened to commission either great works by great architects , or very kitsch architecture by others			1
" great architecture of @entity22 's regime includes the @entity89 by @entity90 and the @entity91 by @entity92 , both from the 1980s , according to @entity9			1
" among the kitsch ones are the horrible @entity94 for the unknown soldier , by the @entity97 @entity96 ( 1982 ) and the sadly famous @entity98 ( 1983 ) by @entity99 and @entity100 , " she adds			0
@entity101 , a @entity1 - born architect who now works in the @entity15 , said , " @entity1 is a beautiful city with an incredible history , it 's one of the nicest cities anywhere			1
" @entity101 , who worked with @entity90 , designer of the @entity89 , in @entity13 before moving to the @entity15 , added , " there are some historic homes from the @entity108 era that need to be preserved			0
we should also open our minds to the 20th and 21st century architecture			1
there was some incredible work in the 1950s			0
" as well as being attractive , the buildings were ahead of their time in terms of the environment : sustainable and suitable for the climate with their thick walls , says @entity9			1
the city she speaks of is a world away from that seen by most people on television news reports			2
" the images on tv focus on events and usually bad events , so they do n't have the time to give an insight into the background landscape , " she said			2
since that first visit in 2003 , however , @entity9 has witnessed a decline that has seen the city divided by concrete walls , blocks and checkpoints			1
also on inside the @entity69 : ' victims of injustice ' in post-revolution @entity140 speak out " because of the sectarian violence , a decision was taken to divide the city into separate zones			2
it 's frozen the conflict but has n't brought any fundamental solutions			0
" now when you drive down a main road , you see concrete walls or blocks blocking off the side streets , " she said			2
other problems the city faces include empty buildings being taken over without regulation ; once attractive brick buildings being patched up with concrete and metal and courtyard gardens being built on			1
" there are no regulations , so many of the central areas are being transformed into second rate commercial buildings			0
in some residential neighborhoods , many of the buildings were left empty or went to people who could n't afford to maintain them properly or transformed the gardens into warehouses , " @entity9 said			0
and then there 's the dust			0
also on inside the @entity69 : @entity180 music students find smart ways around travel ban " @entity22 cut down many palm trees , both in the city and in the desert , " said @entity9			1
" now the dust from the desert is really attacking the buildings			1
it makes them look more dilapidated now than ( they ) did during the war			0
" there are signs of hope for the future though			0
there have been programs to re-plant palm trees and the @entity200 held a conference , which discussed preserving the city 's heritage , according to @entity9			0
" there 's the beginning of a wider awareness that ( @entity1 's ) modern heritage is to be preserved , " she added			0
" people are becoming more and more aware that they have something very special in front of their eyes			0
" after the invasion , @entity101 's company @entity101 announced plans for a privately funded $ 13 billion @entity214 for a new central business district with easy pedestrian access to the historic center and waterfront			0
however , the plan remains on hold because of security concerns			0
" if it 's the last day of my life i will do it , but it would be a terrible mistake to start now because of the violence in the city			0
the city requires a lot of reconstruction of the sewers , the water , the roads , the electricity systems			0
that needs to be the first step , " said @entity101			0
" there are efforts to rebuild the city which is remarkable in light of the security situation			0

20th century architecture and traditional styles produce an attractive low - rise city
some great buildings -- and some bad ones -- were *erected* under @entity22
concrete barricades , dust and neglect have damaged the architecture in recent years
