-- the @entity1 began explosions monday night at the @entity5 - new @entity4 levee at the confluence of the @entity8 and @entity9 rivers			1
the explosions , near the southern border between @entity12 and @entity13 , marked the start of a three - stage process to intentionally breach the levee -- and , in the process , pave the way for tons of water to flood 130,000 acres of @entity12 farmland -- to alleviate pressure caused by historically high water levels in the rivers			1
at 5 p.m. monday , the water level outside @entity24 , @entity13 , was 61.44 feet -- well above the flood stage of 40 feet -- according to the @entity26			1
maj. gen. @entity27 ordered the intentional breach			0
" ( the system ) continues to be under enormous and unprecedented pressure , " said @entity29 , the president of the @entity30			0
" because of that ... i 've ordered the district commander to operate the project			0
" @entity29 said that historic and still - rising flood waters made it imperative to begin the explosive operation as soon as possible			1
the multistage process is expected to continue through tuesday			0
@entity12 attorney general @entity42 's office tried to block the move , challenging the @entity1 ' authority to breach the levee			1
but the @entity49 @entity48 , in a ruling from justice @entity47 , denied @entity12 's bid			2
on monday , gov. @entity51 issued a statement saying he had talked with @entity29 about the attempt " to relieve pressure on other parts of the levee system and save lives			2
" he said @entity12 authorities are ready for the blast and subsequent flood			1
" i urge @entity61 to continue to cooperate fully with state , county and local law enforcement , as they have at every stage of this process , " @entity51 said			0
" together , we will ensure that @entity12 families stay safe in the coming days			2
and together , we will recover and rebuild			0
" without an intentional breach , authorities had warned of massive flooding that could wipe out @entity24			2
already , @entity24 's mayor ordered the city 's 2,800 residents to evacuate			2
@entity29 acknowledged the human dimension of his plan , which has irked many in @entity12 , where hundreds more have been evacuated			2
@entity51 has estimated that it will take tens , if not hundreds of millions of dollars to recover property and rebuild lives as the water rushes through the floodway , including washing out farmland he described as " literally the most productive part of our continent			1
" " it 's a heart - wrenching story , " @entity29 said			0
" it takes a long time to recover from something like this			0
" he said the fate of @entity24 was just one of many factors in his decision , saying he hoped the move would alleviate issues throughout the @entity9 system			1
water levels and flooding have hit record highs in many spots , putting severe strains on systems meant to prevent uncontrolled floods and the resulting loss of life and property			1
with rain continuing to fall and water levels continuing to rise , @entity29 said the situation would only get worse without drastic action			1
" nobody has seen this type of water in the system , " he said			0
" and he did not rule out similar moves elsewhere , including possibly more purposeful explosions at other levees along the @entity9 and its tributaries			0
the area , in @entity12 's so - called " @entity125 , " is one of four floodways along the system that could be opened up			1
@entity29 said he expected the @entity4 levee breach will cause river crests to drop three to four feet " for a few days , " even as he voiced concerns that water levels could very well rise again			1
" this does n't end this historic flood , " said @entity29			0
" this is not going to be over when we operate this			0

new : the @entity1 begins intentionally breaching the levee
water levels near @entity24 , @entity13 , reach 61.4 feet -- far above the 40 - foot flood stage
@entity12 had tried to block the decision , which will flood productive farmland
