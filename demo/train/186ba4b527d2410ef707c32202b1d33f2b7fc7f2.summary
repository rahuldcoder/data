-- it 's hard to imagine a video of lawyers debating points of constitutional law going viral on @entity6 , but the audience for the @entity9 trial -- a lawsuit seeking to overturn @entity12 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage -- is potentially vast			1
unfortunately , that audience will have to wait			0
@entity16 district judge @entity15 had decided to allow the proceedings to be taped , then aired on @entity6			1
but as the trial was set to begin monday morning , the @entity16 @entity18 issued an order blocking its broadcast			2
our camera - phobic high court is making a mistake			0
public access should be encouraged , not thwarted , in court cases involving divisive issues -- all the more so when judicial power is invoked in an effort to invalidate the outcome of a vote			0
although some @entity18 justices might worry that cameras in the courtroom undermine the legitimacy of the judicial process , the reality is just the opposite			0
the @entity9 trial is a case in point			1
people on both sides of the same - sex marriage issue are accustomed to a political process coarsened by ideological rhetoric and political posturing			1
if they can view the prop 8 trial via @entity6 , they will be surprised by what they see : a decision - making process devoid of politics , in which a thoughtful and unbiased judge asks hard questions of both sides ' lawyers in search of legal rules reflecting neutral principles , not political fiat			1
at a time when most @entity16 have lost confidence in the government 's ability to act in the general interest , the potentially huge audience for the @entity9 trial would see that at least one branch of government tries to make decisions on the merits			1
broadcasting the trial will confer legitimacy on the proceedings as nothing else can			2
if , in the end , judge @entity15 upholds prop 8 , rejecting challenges to its constitutionality , opponents of the law will feel angry and aggrieved -- to put it mildly			2
but if they have viewed the trial online , they are less likely to feel victimized in a process that was politically rigged			2
defenders of prop 8 are against broadcasting the trial because they believe it would infringe on their right to a fair trial			1
they claim that release of videos on @entity6 would expose participants to harassment			1
the concern about harassment is not trivial			0
some financial contributors to the prop 8 campaign were harassed following voter approval of the law in november 2008			0
much as i disagree with their position on same - sex marriage , harassment infringes their @entity109 right to participate in the political process			1
but the trial judge is sensitive to these issues and would be able to minimize the risk of harassment			0
under the camera access procedures adopted by @entity118 , the court would control the video cameras and can make sure that certain witnesses are not shown on camera , if necessary			0
in any case , most trial participants are people who , because of their prominence in the electoral campaign , have chosen to have a high public profile on same - sex marriage			1
they expect to be recognized and identified with this issue			0
they have , or should have , thick skins			0
their @entity109 right to join the political fray must be balanced against the public 's @entity109 right to know what transpires in the courtroom			1
there is no secret justice in the @entity16 judicial system			0
courts must be open to assure the parties receive a fair trial and to give the public the necessary confidence that the laws are applied justly			1
to be sure , the @entity109 does n't require public access to include television broadcast or online distribution			0
but when judges exercise their discretion to open their courtrooms to cameras , that choice should be upheld			0
let 's hope the @entity18 quickly rescinds its order blocking online distribution of the @entity9 trial video			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : trial seeking to overturn @entity12 's *gay* marriage ban should be taped
@entity165 : @entity6 viewers will see tough , fair arguments on merits of case
*discussion* will be out in the open and free of political posturing , he writes
he believes the concerns of videotaping opponents can be addressed
