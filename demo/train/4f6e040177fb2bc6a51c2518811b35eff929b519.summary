-- this past week , like many @entity2 , i observed the media frenzy surrounding @entity5 gov. @entity4 as he deliberated over whether to opt in or out of the presidential race			1
as a researcher who studies weight discrimination , i anticipated some of the comments on @entity4 's body weight that inevitably emerged in the press			1
i was surprised , however , at just how much his body weight dominated coverage			0
even among reputable news organizations and political pundits , few could resist mocking @entity4 's " puffed up body , " stereotyping him as undisciplined , or offering the unsolicited advice to " eat a salad and take a walk			1
" rather than his qualifications , reports often featured derogatory comments -- some veiled , many not -- fat jokes , weight - related puns and abundant stereotypes , providing a clear example of how socially acceptable weight bias and discrimination against obese persons have become in our society			2
how common is this ? it may seem less significant compared with discrimination on the basis of gender or race , but it is rapidly increasing and no less important			2
research shows that weight discrimination in the @entity2 has increased by 66 % over the past decade			1
it is now the third-most common type of discrimination reported by women , and the fourth most common among men			0
recent estimates even show that weight discrimination is comparable to prevalence rates of racial discrimination			1
weight discrimination is especially common in the jobs setting			1
decades of research have shown that overweight and obese employees are much less likely to be hired than thinner employees ( even with identical , or better qualifications ) , they receive lower wages , are less likely to be promoted and are more likely to be fired from their jobs , compared with thinner employees			0
criticism of @entity4 's weight suggests this prejudice exists even if the job under consideration is at the highest levels of government -- and it is n't the first time			1
surgeon general dr. @entity73 's excess weight was publicly censured and critiqued in the media discussion over her appointment , often eclipsing consideration of her impressive credentials , awards and accomplishments			2
but in this most current debate -- over the issue of @entity4 's weight -- much of the discussion stems from public misperceptions about body weight and physical appearance			1
health ( and health risk ) comes in different sizes			0
physical appearance alone is not sufficient to make determinations about health ( or to infer anything about other characteristics , such as personal discipline , willpower or political influence , as some recent media reports otherwise suggest )			2
we can not make assumptions about @entity4 's health status , let alone the health status of other thinner political candidates			1
there are many overweight individuals who eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly ; there are many thin individuals who smoke cigarettes , drink too much alcohol , eat poorly , have high blood pressure and are sedentary			0
being thin is not an automatic indicator of health , and neither is being overweight			0
if @entity4 's health status is to be scrutinized , then the health status of his political peers should be scrutinized as well			1
to be clear : there is no reason to assume that a person ca n't be an effective political leader simply because of his or her body weight			0
discounting an individual 's credentials , training , abilities or accomplishments because of body weight is discriminatory			2
and it communicates an unfair , harmful message that a person 's talents and contributions to society have lesser value if that person is obese			0
given that two - thirds of @entity2 are overweight and obese , this is neither an accurate nor appropriate message			0
unfortunately , for people who have been discriminated against because of their weight , little recourse exists			0
there are no federal laws to prohibit weight discrimination			1
only one state -- @entity145 -- has legislation making it unlawful to discriminate against obese persons			0
some individuals have pursued cases of weight discrimination through the @entity152 , but few have succeeded			1
and yet the time may be nearing for more widespread legislation			0
in a recent study , my colleagues and i surveyed a national sample of 1,001 @entity2 about whether or not they would support legislation to prohibit weight discrimination			1
we found that many @entity2 are in favor of these laws , especially in the context of employment			0
specifically , our study found that 81 % of women and 65 % of men expressed support for laws that would make it illegal for employers to discriminate against obese employees because of their weight			2
these findings suggest that more people are becoming aware of weight discrimination as a problem in the workplace , and are in favor of doing something about it			1
it 's time to raise the bar ( and the standards of journalistic reporting ) for appropriate and respectful treatment of @entity2 who are obese			0
because a person 's body weight says nothing about his or her abilities , character or contributions to society			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity198 : media *fixated* on gov. @entity4 's weight as he *pondered* presidential run
@entity198 says weight discrimination has jumped by 66 % in past decade , is common in jobs setting
she says we do n't make assumptions about thin people , who may have *bad* health habits
@entity198 : more people are *recognizing* weight has nothing to do with abilities , character
