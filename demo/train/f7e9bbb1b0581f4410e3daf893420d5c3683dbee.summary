@entity1 's vision for its future is coming into focus			2
on tuesday , @entity4 announced it will add @entity1 options for prescription glasses , its most requested feature since it launched the face - mounted computers last year			1
the move is the latest attempt by @entity4 to make the beta version of its connected eyewear more fashionable and consumer friendly before it releases the product to the broader public toward the end of 2014			1
the prescription lenses will be available in a set of newly designed , fashion - conscious frames that will cost $ 225 each			1
this new titanium line will include four frame shapes called curve , thin , split and bold			0
the outside of the titanium frames is gray , but there are four options for subtle accent colors inside the frames			2
@entity4 is also adding three options for sunglasses that will cost $ 150 each			1
the actual @entity1 hardware , which can shoot video and projects @entity34 content such as e-mails , walking directions and sports scores onto a tiny screen above the wearer 's right eye , is staying the same for now			1
it was last updated in october , when the team made sure the design was modular and could attach to the right side of the @entity48 glass frames			0
you still ca n't quickly pop @entity1 off one frame and onto another , because the process requires undoing a small screw			2
while the task is easy enough , the system is not meant for frequent frame changes			0
@entity4 is betting that people will be so comfortable wearing @entity1 that they wo n't have to choose between prescription glasses and @entity1			1
" we 're going to reach some day , hopefully it will be soon , where people will wonder ' why would i want traditional glasses ? they do n't do @entity67 , ' " said @entity65 director @entity64			2
fusing @entity1 with prescription lenses could lead to its own set of problems , however , because wearers ca n't take them off without limiting their vision , and the @entity34 - enabled glasses are n't welcome everywhere			1
earlier this month , an @entity76 man was questioned by local and federal law enforcement for wearing his @entity1 during a movie			2
the authorities suspected he was secretly recording the film until he explained the eyewear was turned off and connected to a pair of prescription frames			1
( he had purchased the custom frames for $ 600 through a third party			0
) driving while wearing @entity1 is also a thorny issue in many states , including @entity88 , where a woman was ticketed last year for wearing the device while behind the wheel			0
the citation was dismissed in court , but since many people need their prescription glasses to drive , there could be an uptick in the number of motorists sporting @entity1			1
@entity4 is confident these types of issues will be resolved as @entity1 becomes more common place and people learn to recognize when the device is turned on or off			1
currently there is no indicator light but when the device is on , other people can see a faint light on the @entity1 screen			0
the company hopes venues and states hostile to @entity1 might even embrace it down the road			0
for example , there 's a @entity1 app called @entity116 that can wake drivers up if it detects they are falling asleep			0
that might appeal to law enforcement			0
theaters could embrace the technology as a way to deliver close captioning for movies to certain audience members			0
" i think you need to give the technology a chance to breathe and evolve , " said @entity1 spokesperson @entity126			0
prescription glasses can be pricey without insurance , so @entity4 has struck a deal with vision benefits company @entity133 , commonly known as @entity133 , to add coverage for wearers of the new specs			1
insurance reimbursements will extend only to the frames and prescription lenses and ca n't be used toward the @entity116 device itself , which still costs $ 1,500			1
the new frames were designed in - house by @entity4 employees on the @entity1 team , despite earlier rumors of a possible partnership with hip eyewear retailer @entity147			1
going forward , the company does hope to work with third - party eyewear companies so partners can create their own @entity1 compatible products			1
even with the regular - looking new frames , someone wearing @entity1 still stands out			2
in the future , it might be possible to shrink the hardware down so that it 's more subtle , but @entity4 does n't necessarily think that 's what all users will want			2
more modular designs and partnerships with third parties could expand the options so that a @entity1 wearer could decide between wearing an obvious look or going undetected			2
" sometimes i want to go out and i want to be seen , i want people to talk to me about @entity1			0
i 've actually found glass to be the most social experience ever , " said @entity64			0
" but other times i just want to go about my business , stay low key			0
" fighting fires with the help of @entity1 @entity1 users fight privacy fears			0

@entity4 says it will add @entity1 options for prescription glasses
lenses will be available in a set of newly designed frames that will cost $ 225
move is the latest attempt by @entity4 to make its connected eyewear more fashionable
but the @entity34 - enabled glasses still are n't welcome everywhere
