@entity1 has crossed a " red line " with its use of chemical weapons , including the nerve agent sarin gas , against rebels , a move that is prompting the @entity9 to increase the " scale and scope " of its support for the opposition , the @entity0 said thursday			1
the acknowledgment is the first time president @entity17 's administration has definitively said what it has long suspected -- that president @entity20 's forces have used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war			2
" the intelligence community estimates that 100 to 150 people have died from detected chemical weapons attacks in @entity1 to date ; however , casualty data is likely incomplete , " @entity23 , the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications , said in a statement released by the @entity0			1
" while the lethality of these attacks make up only a small portion of the catastrophic loss of life in @entity1 , which now stands at more than 90,000 deaths , the use of chemical weapons violates international norms and crosses clear red lines that have existed within the international community for decades , " @entity23 added			1
the administration also appeared to indicate that it was stepping up its support of the rebels , who have been calling for the @entity9 and others to provide arms needed to battle @entity20 's forces			1
" put simply , the @entity20 regime should know that its actions have led us to increase the scope and scale of assistance that we provide to the opposition , including direct support to the ( rebel @entity55 )			2
these efforts will increase going forward , " @entity23 ' statement said			0
' our own timeline ' @entity23 later told reporters on a conference call that the president has made a decision about military support for the rebels but stopped short of saying the @entity9 government would put weapons in the hands of rebels			1
the president has previously said he did not foresee a scenario with " @entity9 boots on the ground in @entity1			1
" @entity23 also said no decision has been made by @entity17 over whether to institute a no - fly zone in @entity1 , something rebel forces have said is needed to halt @entity20 's aerial bombardment of their strongholds			0
the administration plans to share its findings with @entity82 and its allies , and it will make a decision about how to proceed " on our own timeline , " @entity23 said			1
@entity1 will be among the chief topics for @entity17 at the @entity88 summit in @entity89 next week , where @entity23 said the president will share the @entity9 findings on @entity20 's use of chemical weapons			1
" we 'll be consulting at the @entity88 and the @entity95 about what might be necessary , " @entity23 said			0
@entity1 has long maintained that rebels , not government forces , are behind the use of chemical weapons			1
it also asked the @entity95 to investigate its claims , but it did n't allow inspectors into the country after the @entity95 demanded that its teams be given unrestricted access to the country			0
the administration believes that @entity20 's government maintains control of the chemical weapons and that there is " no reliable , corroborated reporting to indicate that the opposition in @entity1 has acquired or used chemical weapons , " @entity23 statement said			2
@entity23 gave no indication of how many times @entity20 's forces used chemical weapons , but a @entity119 source briefed on the matter said the administration believes @entity1 used such weapons on at least eight occasions			2
no ' half measures ' the @entity0 announcement comes at a critical time for the @entity1 opposition , which has suffered a series of significant losses in recent weeks			1
the setbacks in large part have coincided with the arrival of thousands of @entity133 fighters , backed by @entity134 and @entity135 , to reinforce @entity20 's forces battling the mainly @entity137 uprising			0
after months of gaining ground , the rebels this month lost @entity140 -- one of its strongholds near the @entity134 border -- that was considered essential for its supply route			2
@entity9 sen. @entity145 , who has repeatedly called on the administration to step up its support of the rebels , said on @entity149 's @entity148 that the rebels need anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons			1
" they need a lot more military assistance , " @entity145 , an @entity153 @entity152 , said , adding that the @entity9 and its allies also need to " establish a ' no - fly ' zone to create a safe area " within @entity1			1
" you ca n't do it with half measures			0
you ca n't do it with just supplying weapons , " he said			2
@entity145 said the options were not ideal and a response will not be easy			1
but doing nothing , he said , would be catastrophic			0
until now , the @entity9 has limited its aid to rebels , providing communications equipment , medical supplies and food			1
what complicates any @entity9 military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al @entity180 sympathies , the same stripe of militants @entity9 has battled in @entity183 and @entity184			1
they include an group called the @entity186 , a rebel group that the @entity9 says has links to @entity180			2
earlier this year , the @entity9 said its intelligence analysts had concluded " with varying degrees of confidence " that chemical weapons had been used in the @entity1 civil war			1
but @entity17 said then that " intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient			0
" @entity1 's stockpile as recently as last week , @entity196 's foreign minister said sarin gas had been used several times in the @entity1 civil war , citing results from test samples in @entity196 's possession			0
in early may , the head of the @entity203 on @entity1 said that evidence points to the use of sarin by @entity1 rebel forces			0
but the commission later issued a news release saying it " has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in @entity1 by any parties to the conflict			2
" in april , the head of the @entity218 military 's intelligence research said the @entity1 government is using chemical weapons against rebel forces			2
@entity222 gas can be hard to detect because it is colorless , odorless and tasteless			1
it can cause severe injuries , including blurred vision , convulsions , paralysis and death , to those exposed to it			0
analysts believe the @entity1 government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world			0
specifically , the supply is believed to include sarin , mustard and vx gases , which are banned under international law			0
@entity1 has denied the allegation			0
the @entity243 prohibits the production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons			0
@entity1 is not one of the 188 signatories to the convention			0
in recent months , reports have repeatedly surfaced that @entity1 forces have moved some of the chemical weapons inventories possibly because of deteriorating security in the country , raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of @entity180 - linked groups working with the opposition should @entity20 's government fall			0
as a result , the @entity9 has been talking with neighboring countries about the steps needed to secure the weapons should @entity20 be forced from office			1
the @entity95 estimates that more than 92,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in march 2011 , when a brutal government crackdown on @entity272 - inspired protests devolved into an armed conflict .			0

the @entity0 says it plans to share the findings with @entity82 and @entity9 allies

between 100 to 150 people are believed to have died in @entity222 gas attacks , the @entity0 says
