a small drone crashed onto the @entity3 grounds on monday			1
described as a 2 - foot - long quadcopter -- a drone with four propellers -- the event raises some troubling questions about the possibility that terrorists using armed drones could one day attack the @entity3 or other tightly guarded @entity13 government locations			1
the @entity3 incident occurred the same day a @entity16 drone strike was launched in @entity17 , the first such strike in almost two months , following the @entity17 government being forced out of office last week			1
this indicates that the @entity16 drone program is still moving forward despite the instability in @entity17			0
not so long ago , launching a @entity13 strike on the other side of the world with an armed drone would have been something from science fiction			1
before 9/11 , the @entity13 had only a handful of experimental drones that had never been used to kill anyone			1
today , there are at least 7,000 drones in the @entity13 arsenal , more than 200 of which are armed drones that have killed thousands of people			2
this large @entity13 fleet of drones is a harbinger of an important trend			1
armed drones will likely prove as important to the future of warfare as tanks were during @entity46 we can , of course , expect to see them used not only by the @entity13 , but also by other countries such as @entity51 and @entity52 that are jumping into the production of armed drones			1
but we will also see them being used by terrorist groups			0
a harbinger of this was @entity58 , the militant @entity59 group based in @entity60 , that in september reportedly used drones to bomb a building in neighboring @entity63 used by the @entity65 - affiliated @entity64			2
the drone attack killed a number of militants			0
@entity69 is the key sponsor for @entity58 and has plausibly claimed for the past several years to have manufactured armed drones			0
@entity58 's use of drones marked a milestone for terrorist groups worldwide : it would be the first time a terrorist group used armed drones successfully to carry out an attack			0
that said , it will likely be many years before other countries or terrorist groups are able to build up the capacity that the @entity13 has to carry out lethal drone strikes			2
after all , the @entity13 has had drone bases in countries such as @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
and it is n't as easy as some might think to arm a drone			0
such weapons systems require specific electrical engineering : the wings must be reinforced for the aircraft to sustain the force of launching a missile ; the drone must be equipped with fire control systems and built - in mounting brackets are needed to attach munitions to the vehicle			0
still , even with these inherent limitations , the drone industry thrives , and more companies and nations continue to jump on board the drone bandwagon			0
according to a count by @entity112 , some 80 countries have some kind of drone capability , but few of them have succeeded in arming their drones			2
the @entity13 ' aggressive and secretive drone campaign against @entity65 and its affiliates in countries such as @entity17 appears to be setting a powerful international precedent about the use of armed drones			1
despite this fact , there has been virtually no substantive public discussion about what an international legal framework governing such drone attacks should be among policymakers at the international level			0
it 's long past due for that conversation to happen			0
perhaps a drone landing inside the @entity3 perimeter will help precipitate a wider discussion about how we might prevent a future drone flying into the @entity3 grounds , one that might actually be armed .			1
