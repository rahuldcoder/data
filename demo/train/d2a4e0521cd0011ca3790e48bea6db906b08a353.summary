the research engineer 's rising career seemed enviable			2
@entity2 of @entity3 was working abroad in @entity4 on the latest cell phone and radar technology , coveted by global corporations			1
@entity2 was found dead at age 31 , however , in his @entity4 apartment last june , and his death has become an international controversy that involves local police , the @entity8 , an independent forensic analysis and , the parents allege , corporate intrigue found on their son 's hard drive			1
@entity4 police have been investigating @entity2 's death as a suicide by hanging			1
they refer to a pulley system around a toilet and over a door in @entity2 's flat			1
his parents , however , say that 's absurd and they assert foul play			0
@entity2 's suicide note spoke of family events that never happened , they say			1
the family hired a @entity35 forensic pathologist , who said photos of their son 's body and the @entity4 coroner 's report show a different story : homicide			1
in the wake of family 's revelations about the hard drive , @entity4 police on friday asked the @entity8 for assistance pertaining to evidence on @entity51 soil			1
the hard drive ended up in the parents ' possession when they packed up their son 's apartment , and the mother had thought the device was a small speaker for a computer , she said			1
they later discovered it really was a hard drive , they said			1
parents @entity65 and @entity66 met with a @entity68 representative this week in @entity69			0
the @entity8 , which earlier said it was watching the case , did n't immediately respond to a request for a comment on the @entity4 police announcement			1
@entity75 , a spokesman for the @entity76 in @entity4 , said the @entity8 will comply with the request			1
" the request is focused on issues entirely within the @entity51 , " he said			2
" to be clear , the investigation into @entity2 's death continues to be led by the @entity4 police			1
" documents on the hard drive and its login activity suggest their son was working on a project that may have led to his death , his parents say			1
the circumstances of their son 's death have upended the couple 's life in @entity94 , @entity3			1
" i just fell to the floor and said it could n't be my first - born son			0
it could n't be , " said @entity98 , mother of four boys , who learned of her eldest child 's death from his girlfriend			1
@entity66 , an airline pilot whose wife told him of his son 's death right after he flew a long flight , said : " i just , just screamed in the airport			2
" @entity2 worked for the @entity111 in @entity4 from december 2010 until his resignation last may 2 , the government research institute said			1
he is believed to have died during the overnight hours of june 22 and june 23 , the family said			0
though the institute said he was " thought of highly by his supervisor and peers , " he disliked his job , his parents said			0
that 's another reason why his suicide note is suspicious , his parents said : it thanked his company			0
the note also spoke of his family drinking @entity125 on a beach -- an event that never occurred , they said			0
" when i read the note i handed it back to the officer and i said my son may have killed himself , but he did not write this note , " @entity98 said of meeting with authorities in @entity4 last year			0
the couple also found no evidence of a pulley system : there were no pulleys or holes in the ceramic walls in the bathroom , @entity98 said			0
@entity2 's apartment appeared as if he were about to return to the @entity51 : clean clothes were folded and boxes packed			1
a plane ticket sat on the table			0
he also had a new job lined up , the family said			0
holding a doctorate in electrical engineering , @entity2 worked for his prominent employer , helping to develop faster , more powerful semiconductors by using the compound gallium nitride			2
in his last months , @entity2 expressed stress about his work and even fear for his life , his family said			2
he wondered if his work might be illegal or a risk to @entity51 national security , his parents said			0
after his death , @entity2 's parents found that his hard drive contained a proposal between the @entity4 outfit and a prominent @entity165 telecom firm , @entity164 , to build a powerful amplifier using gallium nitride technology			1
the @entity168 showed the documents to @entity170			0
@entity164 has been at the center of controversy			0
it and another @entity165 telecom company , @entity173 , were cited last october by the @entity51 @entity174 , which said the two firms " can not be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the @entity51 and to our systems			0
" that comment referred to the firms ' business practices , and the committee report said , " the @entity51 should view with suspicion the continued threat of the @entity51 telecommunications market " by the @entity165 companies			0
@entity164 rejected the committee report , calling the findings " baseless			0
" in reference to the proposal found on @entity2 's hard drive , @entity164 and the @entity111 in @entity4 insisted they had no such project or even a business relationship , though they acknowledged preliminary talks			1
nothing became of those talks , they said			0
" there is speculation by the @entity202 that @entity2 's death was related to a project undertaken by @entity205 with @entity164			1
neither ime nor @entity2 was involved in any classified research project , " @entity205 said in a statement			2
" the research and development carried out in @entity205 is to advance economic growth for @entity4 and deliver on healthcare and social benefits , " it said			0
@entity205 is n't commenting further because @entity2 's death is under police investigation			1
" @entity205 has cooperated fully with the authorities and will continue to do so , " the institute said			0
@entity164 spokesman @entity217 said that gallium nitride , or @entity220 , technology improves power amplifier efficiency and is " widely recognized as a key technology for next - generation wireless base stations			0
" " @entity205 approached @entity164 on one occasion to cooperate with them in the @entity220 field , but we decided not to accept , and consequently do not have any cooperation with @entity205 related to @entity220 , " @entity217 said in a statement to @entity170			0
the @entity4 police have said they received " no response " from the @entity2 family to share evidence , including the hard drive			1
" if they were not comfortable handing evidence in their possession to the @entity241 ( @entity241 ) , they could seek the @entity8 's help to review the evidence , " a spokesman said			2
" as there has so far been no response to this request , @entity241 has sought the @entity8 's assistance to engage the family and for @entity8 to examine the evidence			1
" on february 20 , @entity4 police told the @entity251 that they had already examined the hard drive			1
the couple , however , doubts that because the police description of the drive does n't match the one they found in their son 's apartment , they said			2
the drive shows someone accessing it for only three minutes the night their son died and then again four days later , right before the parents visited his apartment for the first time , the parents said			2
a forensic analysis of the drive shows someone reviewing , creating and deleting files during those two access events , the family said			1
that forensic analysis was conducted by a computer expert , the family said			0
@entity4 officials have invited the @entity168 to a coroner 's inquest , scheduled to be held sometime this month			2
the parents are n't saying whether they would to return to @entity4			0
meanwhile , @entity283 ( @entity284 ) , chairman of the @entity285 , said his staff has met with @entity51 embassy and @entity4 officials in @entity4 , and he has spoken with @entity290 officials " to ensure this issue on their radar , " a spokeswoman said			1
@entity66 had pictures taken of his son 's body when it was returned to the @entity51			2
the photos show bruises on @entity2 's hands and a lump on his forehead , which the independent forensic pathologist said showed a fight , the parents said			1
the back of @entity2 's neck was cut , the family said			1
@entity2 most likely was strangled by a wire , the pathologist told the family			2
bruises also indicated that @entity2 was trying to squeeze his hands under the wire , the family said			2
there was little fluid in his lungs ; hanging typically takes several minutes making the lungs heavy with fluid , the pathologist told the parents			0
" it 's hard , " @entity66 said			2
" every time i open those pictures , it 's difficult			0
" but we will go to the ends of the @entity330 to see justice is done , " he said			0
