-- two days ago , i learned about two young people killed by drug gangs in the border city of @entity5 , @entity6 , their corpses bound and hung from a bridge			1
unfortunately , drug murders happen so often in @entity6 that they are not news anymore			2
the murders have received a lot of international attention because the bodies were found with handwritten messages claiming that the couple had been killed for snitching on the cartels via the @entity20			0
is it possible that these murders grabbed more attention than last month 's 50 - person massacre because of the connection to social media ? as a technologist , i find it easy to get swept up in the techno - utopian view of how social technologies are changing the world for the better			1
for example , @entity34 hashtags are saving lives in @entity6 by empowering citizens to report shootings and helping others to avoid them			0
however , those same hashtags have landed three people in jail on charges of " terrorism " for supposedly spreading false rumors online			0
now we learn about the murders of supposed " internet snitchers			0
" it is not clear whether the couple was killed for actually posting something online or whether their murder was used as an opportunity to scare people away from social media			1
in any case , the messages against online reporting might indicate that social media sites are seen as a threat			1
for example , one of the notes on the bodies named @entity65 , a website run anonymously on @entity70 's @entity69 platform			0
social technologies , like other peer - to - peer technologies , are incredibly disruptive			0
social media open new opportunities for empowering the disenfranchised , but they also create big new challenges -- some so big that people 's lives might hang in the balance			1
there has been a heated discussion in the tech world about online anonymity , especially the " real names only " policies of some social networks			1
social media is seen as neutral ground by people in @entity6			1
they might not trust their government or even their neighbors , but they do trust big - name , high - tech companies to provide an unbiased platform that empowers them to connect with others			0
these events in @entity6 are another reminder of the responsibility that high - tech companies have when providing these empowering platforms			2
yes , these are for - profit enterprises , but with great tech power comes great responsibility ( as @entity104 might say )			0
the @entity106 media are in a privileged position to report safely on what is happening in @entity6			1
@entity106 journalists can , and should , amplify the voices of those who are unheard			2
@entity6 voices present in social media speak of a complex problem with just as much relevance for the @entity106 as @entity6			1
after all , the drug war is a thorny geopolitical conflict closely linked to @entity106 financial stability and national security			2
the @entity106 public partially funds the war : via taxes on one side and through drug consumption on the other			0
my hope is that the fascination for social media communication will drive better coverage of systemic issues at the core of the conflict , such as debates on decriminalization , arms and human trafficking			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			0
