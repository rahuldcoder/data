@entity1 , @entity0 -- the most lucrative match in world football took place at @entity6 on monday -- with @entity7 defeating @entity8 1 - 0 to collect a prize which is estimated to be worth nearly $ 100 million -- more than any @entity11 or @entity12 final			1
$ 100m smiles ? @entity14 players celebrate after winning last year 's @entity16 play - off match			1
in fact , international accountancy firm @entity17 say the @entity16 play - off final is the richest single game in any sport			1
the financial jackpot for @entity7 includes a $ 53m payment towards the coming season , and a minimum of $ 18m in each of the following two seasons			1
@entity26 , partner in the sport business group at accountancy firm @entity17 , told @entity2 the difference between the $ 100m reward for the winner and what the loser receives is larger than in any other single event of any sport			0
" i ca n't think of a bigger one			0
people started talking about the @entity37 for $ 20m cricket match when it came out -- but this is much bigger , " he said			0
the massive injection of money to the victor is largely due to the lucrative television rights deals for @entity45 football matches			0
earlier this year the @entity45 secured a new set of television deals for the 2010 - 2013 seasons worth a record $ 2.70 billion ( £ 1.782b )			2
the financial comparison between this match and the @entity51 final -- which will be contested between @entity52 and @entity53 -- is remarkable			0
while a 2008 study funded by @entity55 found that the winner of the @entity51 could earn as much as $ 149m ( € 110m ) , @entity26 said the financial difference between winning an losing the final would be only around $ 6m			2
" in terms of financial pressure -- if a player from @entity62 or @entity7 steps up to take a penalty in that match -- they have a lot more riding on it than anyone in the @entity51 would , " he said			2
there is also potential for the guaranteed $ 100m to get even sweeter for the victor			0
@entity26 told @entity2 that in addition to the direct pay - out benefits , most clubs also experience greater ticket - sales and can attract higher advertising and sponsorship revenue			0
a club which managed to avoid relegation from the @entity45 in the next season could gain a total of more than $ 100m as a result of winning the match			1
a club that did drop back down would still receive the " parachute payment " of $ 18m for two further seasons , @entity26 said			2
it 's not an easy road for the team that wins this match , however			0
of all the play - off match winners in the last decade , only three -- @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity14 -- remain in the top flight			1
last year 's winner , @entity14 , sit on the brink of relegation this weekend , and the challenge they face to stay up is the same one either @entity7 or @entity8 will get to face next season : global giant @entity52 before 80,000 people at @entity101			1
