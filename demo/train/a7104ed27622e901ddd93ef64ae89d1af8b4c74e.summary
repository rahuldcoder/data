" i want all my fans to know that the @entity10 is forcing me and several of the other top players to do a four - hour commercial shoot for @entity10 marketing materials , " @entity1 told her web site			1
" they want me to do this shoot on sunday , monday or tuesday of the @entity8 tournament after flying 12 hours from @entity25			1
" i have set my own personal rules when it comes to doing shoots and i never do shoots before tournaments because they are mentally draining and i want to just focus on my tennis			0
" now the @entity10 is telling me if i do n't do this shoot they will fine me over $ 300,000			1
as you can see the @entity10 loves to fine players			1

" i informed the @entity10 several months ago that if i played @entity48 , i would have to pull out of @entity53			0
" now they are forcing me to give an injury for the reason why i am pulling out or they will give me an additional fine on top of the $ 125,000 fine already given me			2
i am a very giving person but i refuse to give any more of my money to the @entity10			0
" so i want everyone to know that apart from getting sick the past few days , i am healthy and i am looking forward to playing @entity8			0
" meanwhile , top seed @entity66 has reached the final of the @entity68 in @entity69 , beating @entity72 fourth seed @entity70 6 - 2 6 - 4 on saturday			0
