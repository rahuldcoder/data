@entity0 -- the annual @entity2 , which wrapped up here thursday , is all about next - generation gaming			2
more than 45,000 game industry professionals got their first look at @entity7 's @entity6 , which will retail for $ 500 starting in november , and @entity9 's @entity8 , which will sell for $ 400 this fall			2
but for players , the real focus at the show was on the next generation of games , especially the slew of exclusives lined up for each device			1
what 's at stake is a piece of the global video - game market , which @entity24 video game analyst @entity22 expects to reach $ 70.4 billion this year and grow to $ 86.1 billion by 2016			1
@entity22 forecasts that the number of gamers worldwide will reach 1.2 billion this year			2
the latest crop of games features an upgrade in graphic fidelity that brings athletes like @entity33 star @entity32 to life in @entity36 " @entity35 " in photorealistic detail			1
watching an " @entity39 " match on @entity6 or @entity8 is like seeing a live mixed martial arts pay - per - view , thanks to new technology			2
even the undead look better , as the zombies in @entity48 's @entity6 exclusive " @entity46 , " an open world horror game , would scare the " walkers " of @entity51 's " @entity50			2
" the new consoles feature the processing power to create larger , more immersive open worlds for gamers to explore , as evidenced in @entity57 's online open world role - playing game " @entity59 's @entity58			1
" the latest game in the @entity59 universe , which has sold more than 76 million games worldwide , is set in @entity63 after a lethal virus has unleashed chaos			1
but among a host of fresh - looking titles , there were several that stood out at @entity70			1
" @entity71 : @entity71 " ( @entity57 , october 29 , @entity72 , @entity73 , pc , @entity8 , @entity6 ) : @entity57 is betting that gamers will love living a pirate 's life this fall with this open world virtual @entity79			2
set in the turbulent 18th - century @entity81 , the game lets players step into the boots of @entity84 and set sail for adventure across a huge map with more than 50 islands and locations to explore			2
gamers will interact with famous pirates like @entity92 and @entity93 as they contend with warring @entity95 and @entity96 ships and armies and other privateers			0
seamless gameplay allows the player to traverse the rooftops of a bustling @entity102 and then jump into the ocean to climb aboard the ship @entity105 and escape			0
this bestselling franchise continues to innovate with new gameplay and a constantly changing window into history -- one that 's fun to play through again and again			2
" @entity112 " ( @entity114 / @entity113 , 2014 ; @entity6 , @entity8 , @entity72 , @entity73 ) : @entity113 knows a thing or two about shooters , having built " @entity118 " into a global franchise for @entity7			1
now , the developer has partnered with " @entity121 " publisher @entity114 to add multiplayer and a persistent world to the alien - fighting action			1
players take on the roles of @entity127 of the last city on @entity129 in a story that spans the solar system			0
the shooting action is trademark @entity113 , but where this game stands out is the seamless blending of cooperative gameplay into bigger public events like taking out a giant alien boss with other players who are also exploring the world			0
there are community spaces for players to prepare for their next missions and connect with friends , as well as competitive multiplayer ( although @entity113 is keeping mum on details )			0
the developer has mapped out a franchise worth of adventures for this new world , and the first reveal looks promising			0
" @entity154 : @entity155 " ( @entity7 / @entity156 , @entity6 ) : players take control of gen. @entity159 in this brutal third - person action game that blends elements from popular movies like " gladiator " and tv series like " @entity165 " and " @entity166			1
" in addition to featuring sword and sandal hack - and - slash gameplay , the player will have to order troops to do things like fire catapults at enemies and remain in formation with shields up to avoid an onslaught of arrows			0
@entity165 has never looked more beautiful , not that the game 's pace will give players much time to take in the scenery			0
developer @entity156 , creator of the " @entity187 " franchise , is making the most of @entity6 with this interactive take on history			0
the first gameplay demo at @entity192 showcased a pick - up - and - play experience that blended swordplay and shield defense through an active battlefield			0
the amount of activity around your army is staggering and a glimpse into what next generation offers			0
" @entity205 " ( @entity57 / @entity206 , @entity6 , @entity8 ) : though there was a lot of traffic in the racing genre , from @entity214 ' " @entity213 " to @entity9 's " @entity212 , " one game stood out from the crowd			1
@entity57 's " @entity205 " introduces the entire @entity216 as a cooperative playing ground for up to four players to join up and take on missions in fully realized cities like @entity63 , @entity221 and @entity63			1
the heart of this experience is a gearhead 's dream , which allows players to customize licensed vehicles to the smallest details			0
depending on whether the mission is across @entity232 beaches or the @entity221 desert , players can fine - tune their vehicles before leaving the garage			0
driving games ( and sports titles ) are among the best ways to showcase new technology , and " @entity205 " delivers			1
" @entity240 " ( @entity214 / @entity241 , 2014 , @entity6 , @entity72 , pc ) : the original founders of @entity244 are offering a very different first - person shooter experience with " @entity240			1
" the game features pilots who can fight on the ground with traditional weapons ( and a cool jetpack ) or jump into 24 - foot - tall @entity251 , mechanized robots that introduce a lot of firepower to the battlefield			0
the dynamic and advantage of these two very different fighting styles -- agile pilots and hulking @entity260 -- introduces something fresh to the crowded shooter genre			0
the action , which in an @entity192 demo focused on protecting a hovering spacecraft , is fast and furious			0
it 's seamless jumping from on - foot action to the hulking @entity251 as the battle erupts around you			1
the game 's multiplayer features @entity274 - style action sequences as centerpieces of this conflict between warring factions ( the @entity277 and the militia ) in a distant frontier .			1
