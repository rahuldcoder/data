-- it 's well known that the secret to @entity4 's meteoric success in the world of consumer technology was the vision , leadership and creativity of @entity10 , the company 's celebrity founder			1
" @entity10 built a company and culture that is unlike any other in the world and we are going to stay true to that -- it is in our dna , " @entity12 , @entity10 ' successor , wrote in a staff memo after @entity10 resigned from his post as @entity4 's ceo in august			1
what 's less talked about is what drove @entity10 , who died wednesday at 56			1
as with anyone , @entity10 ' values were shaped by his upbringing and life experiences			1
he was born in 1955 in @entity29 and grew up amid the rise of hippie counterculture			0
@entity32 and the @entity33 were his two favorite musical acts , and he shared their political leanings , antiestablishment views and , reportedly , youthful experimentation with psychedelic drug usage			0
the name of @entity10 ' company is said to be inspired by the @entity33 ' @entity42 , which repeatedly sued the electronics maker for trademark infringement until signing an exclusive digital distribution deal with @entity46			1
like the @entity33 , @entity10 took a spiritual retreat to @entity48 and regularly walked around his neighborhood and the office barefoot			1
traversing @entity48 sparked @entity10 ' conversion to @entity52			1
@entity53 , a monk , presided over his wedding to @entity55 , a @entity57 mba			0
' life is an intelligent thing ' rebirth is a precept of @entity52 , and @entity4 experienced rebirth of sorts when @entity10 returned , after he was fired , to remake a company that had fallen the verge of bankruptcy			1
" i believe life is an intelligent thing , that things are n't random , " @entity10 said in a 1997 interview with @entity68 , providing a glimpse into his complicated belief system that extends well beyond the @entity72 teachings			1
karma is another principle of the religion , but it did n't appear to be a system @entity10 lived by			1
if he feared karma coming back to bite him , the sentiment was n't evident in his public statements about competitors and former colleagues , calling them " bozos " lacking taste			0
those who worked for @entity10 described him as a tyrant they feared meeting in an elevator			1
" you 'd be surprised how hard people work around here , " @entity10 said in a 2004 interview with @entity92			2
" they work nights and weekends , sometimes not seeing their families for a while			0
sometimes people work through @entity100 to make sure the tooling is just right at some factory in some corner of the world so our product comes out the best it can be			0
" some engineers who worked tirelessly on the original @entity108 emerged from the project estranged from their spouses and children			0
@entity10 ' relentless work ethic may have been shaped by some of his dysfunctional family affairs as well			1
' i 've done things i 'm not proud of ' @entity10 was adopted by @entity117 and @entity118 , who promised his birth mother , @entity119 ( whom @entity10 later tracked down with the help of a private investigator ) , that they would send him to a university			2
he dropped out of @entity124 after one semester , and he reportedly never was willing to talk to his birth father			0
@entity10 had a daughter , @entity126 , out of wedlock with @entity128			2
he denied paternity for many years , swearing in a court document that he was sterile			0
later , he had three more kids with @entity55			0
" i 've done a lot of things i 'm not proud of , such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when i was 23 and the way i handled that , " @entity10 said in a statement in 2011 to promote his authorized biography			2
that youthful indiscretion came before @entity10 turned to @entity52 and karma			1
' the core values are the same ' the @entity72 scriptures , according to tradition , were transmitted in secret , as were many of @entity4 's business dealings and @entity10 ' personal struggles			1
like the paranoid secrecy that surrounded product development at @entity4 , @entity10 spurned most reporters ' interview requests , misled them in statements he did give , refused to disclose details of his cancer to investors until undergoing an operation and became shrouded in a scandal involving backdating stock options			1
by all accounts , he played by his own rules			0
those who disclosed his secrets or whispered about his company were punished or threatened			0
@entity4 sued , and eventually settled with , the anonymous young blogger behind @entity163 , which accurately reported on @entity4 rumors in the early 2000s			2
and then there 's the story of a lost iphone 4 prototype , which was purchased and publicized by the blog @entity170			0
" when this whole thing with @entity170 happened , i got a lot of advice from people that said , ' you 've got to just let it slide , ' " @entity10 said onstage at a technology convention in 2010			2
" i thought deeply about this , and i ended up concluding that the worst thing that could possibly happen as we get big and we get a little more influence in the world is if we change our core values and start letting it slide			0
i ca n't do that			0
" that stance was repeated this year , with @entity10 still as ceo though on medical leave , when another employee left a prototype @entity192 in a bar			2
@entity4 enlisted the help of @entity29 police to investigate			2
" we have the same values now as we had then , " @entity10 said at the @entity197 conference			1
" we 're a little more experienced , certainly beat - up , but the core values are the same			2
" ' we 're here to put a dent in the universe ' perhaps the most salient of those values is , simply , to make an outsize impact on society			1
or , as @entity10 put it , " we 're here to put a dent in the universe			1
" however , @entity4 and @entity10 did n't make much of a dent with philanthropy			1
" we do things where we feel we can make a significant contribution , " @entity10 told @entity92 in 2004			2
" and our primary goal here is ... not to be the biggest or the richest			0
" to achieve that goal , @entity10 was an obsessive micromanager			2
part of the reason @entity10 ' dna is so ingrained in @entity4 is because he forced his hand onto so many parts of it			1
he personally fielded some customer - service requests sent to him via e-mail ; he was active in product design , co-authoring more than 300 patents ; and he had a hand in the marketing efforts , including the famous @entity229 and @entity108 vs. @entity231 campaigns			0
" what is @entity4 , after all ? " @entity10 mused to @entity68			1
" @entity4 is about people who think ' outside the box , ' people who want to use computers to help them change the world , to help them create things that make a difference , and not just to get a job done			2
" ' focus and simplicity ' @entity10 famously lured @entity243 , the @entity244 president , to run @entity4 by saying : " do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water , or do you want a chance to change the world ? " ( they had a permanent falling out when @entity10 was booted from @entity4			1
) " what makes @entity10 's methodology different from everyone else 's is that he always believed the most important decisions you make are not the things you do , but the things you decide not to do , " @entity243 said in a 2010 interview with @entity92			1
" he 's a minimalist			0
i remember going into @entity10 's house , and he had almost no furniture in it			1
he just had a picture of @entity264 , whom he admired greatly , and he had a @entity266 lamp and a chair and a bed			0
he just did n't believe in having lots of things around , but he was incredibly careful in what he selected			0
" restraint , at least in gadget design and interior decorating , was a primary principle for @entity10			2
shortly after his return to @entity4 , he shuttered several divisions and turned his attention to a few key initiatives			2
even today , @entity4 's product lines and revenue are zeroed in on just a few industries in which the company can dominate			1
" that 's been one of my mantras : focus and simplicity , " @entity10 told @entity92 in 1998			1
" simple can be harder than complex : you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple			0
but it 's worth it in the end because once you get there , you can move mountains			0
" he elaborated in the interview with the publication six years later : " it comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we do n't get on the wrong track or try to do too much			0
we 're always thinking about new markets we could enter , but it 's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important			0
' @entity4 's management team members have each adopted parts of this code			1
@entity312 , the industrial - design executive , echoes @entity10 ' simplicity ethic			1
@entity315 , the mobile software lead , has apparently inherited some of @entity10 ' enthusiasm and showmanship			0
and @entity12 , the former operations chief and , by some accounts , current workaholic micromanager , runs the company like he manages his private life : shrouded in secrecy			0
however , @entity12 comes out of his shell in order to impart the ethical standards onto new recruits			0
@entity330 , along with other execs , teaches at @entity331			0
@entity331 ensures that employees are thoroughly educated on the company 's principles and that @entity10 ' ideals live on			1
@entity10 believed people never stop learning and should voraciously open their minds to new ideas			0
put another way , like in his closing statement to @entity57 's graduating class in 2005 , " stay hungry			0

@entity10 ' values were shaped by his upbringing and life experiences
" that 's been one of my mantras : focus and simplicity , " @entity10 said in 1998
traversing @entity48 sparked @entity4 *co-founder* 's conversion to @entity52
