@entity0 is at it again			1

the actor waged a war of words with a @entity9 journalist over a report alleging @entity0 's wife was tweeting during actor @entity13 's funeral thursday			1
" the pregnant yoga instructor 's social media feed was full of upbeat posts while ' @entity20 ' star 's friends , family and co-stars were gripped with grief at a @entity25 catholic church , " journalist @entity14 wrote			1
" messages included a request for ideas about wedding anniversary presents and promotional notes about her upcoming appearance on the @entity34 show			0
" in a statement hours later , @entity0 said his wife , @entity36 , left her phone in her car			1
" it 's disgraceful that a reporter would manufacture and publish a story and not call for comment or explanation -- especially when it 's intended to take away attention from honoring the memory of a beloved figure like @entity13 , " he said friday			1
his statement came after a series of fiery tweets aimed at the journalist			0
" my wife and i attend a funeral to pay our respects to an old friend , and some toxic @entity56 writes this f * * * * * * trash , " he tweeted			1
" my wife did not use her phone , in any capacity , at our friends funeral			1

" attempts to reach the journalist were unsuccessful			0
@entity0 's wife also weighed in on the report			1
" i hope that this reporter knows how much pain and drama he has caused from his poor journalism , " @entity74 tweeted			0
" lying and bullying are shameful			0
" @entity81 , which lets users post messages in 140 characters or less , also allows the advance scheduling of tweets to post later			0
it is unclear whether that was the case			0
shortly after the rant , @entity0 deleted his @entity81 account			2
on friday , @entity91 , an @entity92 advocacy group , published a statement @entity0 gave to the organization : " my ill - advised attack on @entity14 of the @entity9 had absolutely nothing to do with issues of anyone 's sexual orientation			1
" @entity0 also wrote , " i would not advocate violence against someone for being gay and i hope that my friends at @entity91 and the gay community understand that my attack on mr. @entity14 in no way was the result of homophobia			2
" @entity0 told the online publication @entity110 that he wo n't be going back to @entity81			2
" @entity81 and @entity111 and @entity112 and @entity113 and @entity114 and @entity115 , all these things are social media tools that we were all told we had to have , and what we 're realizing is that no you do n't ! no you do n't			0
all this energy goes into these things , and for what ? " he said			0
this is not the first time the actor has been engaged in a public confrontation			0
