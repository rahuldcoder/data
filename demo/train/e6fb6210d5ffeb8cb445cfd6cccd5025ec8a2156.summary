-- in what could prove to be a precedent - setting case , the @entity1 has issued a complaint against a @entity6 company for firing an employee after she posted critical , derogatory comments about her supervisor on @entity10			1
the company , ambulance service @entity11 , says emergency medical technician @entity13 was fired because of " multiple , serious complaints about her behavior , " not because she took to a social networking site to describe her supervisor in various unflattering terms , among the mildest of which was comparing the supervisor to a psychiatric patient			1
the labor board , a federal agency that oversees union elections and investigates claims of unfair labor practices , accuses the company of illegally terminating @entity31 and denying her access to union representation during an investigatory review			1
the labor relations board argues that workers ' criticism of their bosses on social networking sites like @entity10 is generally " a protected concerted activity			1
" " you are permitted to talk about terms and conditions with employees or anyone else , it 's public because you are protected under the @entity51 , " says @entity42 , the board 's regional director in @entity44 , @entity6			1
@entity42 says that in addition to describing her supervisor in unflattering and sometimes vulgar terms on her @entity10 page , @entity31 also wrote about " how the company allows a 17 to be a supervisor			1
" the 17 reference is the company 's jargon for a psychiatric patient , @entity42 says			2
the @entity51 gives workers the right to form unions and it prohibits employers from taking action against employees -- union or non-union -- for discussing working conditions , says @entity42			0
he adds that the case could be " ground - breaking " because it is in the uncharted legal territory of social networking sites on the internet			0
" it was @entity31 's ... own page ; she did this on her own time in her own home			2
this case is different because in this situation it happened online and the company 's rules were unlawfully broad , " says @entity42			2
in a statement to @entity0 , @entity11 says it believes that the offensive statements made against the co-worker were not activities protected under federal law			0
the company " denies the allegations made by the @entity1 and believes the facts will show that they are without merit			1
the employee in question was discharged based on multiple , serious complaints about her behavior , " the statement says			0
an attorney representing the ambulance company adds , " this is not about @entity10			1
" " this employee was terminated after the company received complaints on two separate incidents in 2009			2
all pointed to @entity31 's rude and discourteous behavior with patients , " says attorney @entity106			0
@entity31 , who was fired last december and who is seeking reinstatement to her job , declined comment to @entity0 , saying only that granting an interview would " jeopardize her case at this point			2
" on the issue of assistance from a union representative , the labor board says @entity31 wanted help from the union representing the company 's workers when she wrote up a response to the company			0
the company 's lawyer says she was not denied union representation			0
" before submitting her response , she checked in with her union representative , " says @entity106			0
a labor board hearing for the case is scheduled for january 25 .			0
