-- @entity1 moved to within three points of leaders @entity4 at the top of the @entity6 after @entity7 inspired them to a 2 - 0 victory at @entity9 to spoil new manager @entity11 's first match in charge			1
captain @entity7 produced an impressive display on his return from a hamstring injury and scored his 10th league goal of the season in the 28th minute after a neat one - two with @entity18			1
his surging run then led to substitute and fellow - @entity20 @entity19 scoring the second 12 minutes from time as former @entity22 player @entity11 's reign at the @entity23 got off to a losing start			2
with these two teams due to meet in the return fixture at the @entity29 on wednesday , @entity26 's side could well take over at the top of the table in the next few days			0
@entity9 remain second from bottom , with @entity11 having swapped one relegation battle with @entity34 for another			1
earlier in the day , @entity37 captain @entity36 put the seal on his side 's long - awaited return to winning ways as they overcame @entity42 2 - 0 at @entity43			1
@entity36 applied the finish to @entity46 's 54th - minute free - kick to put rovers within touching distance of their first three - point haul since november			0
defender @entity51 had earlier settled the home side 's nerves with a fortuitous 24th - minute opener after he ricocheted home an attempted clearance by former @entity37 winger @entity57			0
in the day 's other match , @entity58 failed to cash in on slip - ups by their @entity62 - chasing rivals after being held 0 - 0 at home by @entity64			2
@entity58 could have closed the gap on the top four after @entity66 , beaten at @entity67 , and @entity68 , held at home by @entity70 , both dropped points on saturday			0
but a combination of a below - par performance and some fine saves by @entity76 meant they had to settle for their first goalless draw of the league campaign .			0

@entity1 move to within three points of @entity4 at the top of the @entity6
returning captain @entity7 scores one goal and makes the other in a 2 - 0 win at @entity9
the result spoils the debut of new @entity9 manager @entity11 following his switch from @entity34
