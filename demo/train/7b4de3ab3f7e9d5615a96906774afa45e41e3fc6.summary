-- in this dark and dismal year for college sports , when each scandal seems worse than the next , inspiration arrives in a motorized wheelchair			2
in a month when @entity8 is dealing with child sex abuse charges against former assistant coach @entity10 , the fallout bringing down longtime head coach @entity12 and the university president , a reason to still believe in what 's good about college football will never play another down again			1
his name is @entity17 , and you 'll find him saturday on the field at @entity20 in @entity21			1
he will be honored at the team 's annual senior day before a game against @entity25 , and the expected crowd of more than 50,000 will no doubt save the loudest cheers for him			2
on october 16 , 2010 , he collided with @entity28 kick returner @entity29 while making a tackle			2
the collision left him paralyzed from the neck down , and when he awoke in the hospital , he was connected to a respirator that doctors said he would need for the rest of his life			1
" i could barely turn my head , " @entity17 said			1
" they had to roll me to change my position			2
it felt like i was going to die			2
that 's what it felt like			2
" but now , 13 months later , he can move his head and shoulders when he talks , his long braids moving as he does			1
he has attacked therapy the way he once went after weight - lifting records in the gym , and believes it is only a matter of time before he is walking back on the field at @entity54			1
@entity55 : why @entity17 thinks he will walk again no one can say for sure if that will happen			1
but his belief that it someday will not only fuels him , but also has become a rallying cry that has spread from the @entity63 , @entity21 , campus across the country			2
@entity17 , 21 , has a way of touching people he 's met , from professional athletes to his teammates to the more than 26,000 fans who follow him on @entity70			1
" just right away , he had this positive energy and positive outlook on life , " said @entity71 , the breakout star for the @entity74 women 's soccer team who became friends with him at a professional game in july			1
" that 's what inspired me			2
i feel i 'm lucky to get to know him because he 's such an inspiring person			2
" he has inspired @entity85 , the @entity86 linebacker , to support his " @entity88 " with t - shirt sales			2
he has spent time with nearly all the professional teams in the @entity92 area , including @entity95 stars @entity93 and @entity96			2
@entity97 , the @entity98 sideline reporter , reached out to @entity17 a few weeks after the accident			1
he caught her on a bad day when he called			1
" here i am , feeling sorry for myself and this sweet kid calls me , " @entity97 said			0
" it really put a new perspective on my life			0
i get emotional just thinking about it now			0
i thank him for that			0
" but he has n't just met celebrities			0
@entity17 has made inspiring others a goal for his life , regularly speaking to youth and school groups around @entity21			1
last month at a @entity115 middle school , students cheered from classroom windows as his wheelchair motored up to the entrance , waving signs with his name and no. 52 , his uniform number			0
he told the kids that he believes this is only the beginning of his journey , how any time life gets him down , he remembers there is always someone who has it worse than he does			2
" i take this as a responsibility to get better , " he said			0
" i do n't want to let everybody down who 's been behind my back			0
that 's what keeps me going every day			0
even though i ca n't control when i 'm going to get up , but what i can control i take as a responsibility to do what i 've got to do to get better			2
" near the end of the question and answer period that followed his speech , one shy girl walked to the front of the stage and asked him a blunt question : " did you ever ask @entity148 why this happened to you ? " " i do n't ask @entity148 why , because i truly believe this happened for a reason , " he told her			0
" i believe i 've been called upon to help other people out			1
i do n't ask @entity148 why this happened to me , because i know that question will be answered down the road when i am walking again , and i 've helped a lot more people believe in themselves			1
" that word -- believe -- has become his rallying cry			0
spend time with him , and it 's easy to see how frustration could take over			0
@entity17 has no movement below his shoulders			1
it takes two hours , with his mother , @entity167 , and a physical therapist , to get him out of bed and dressed in the morning			0
his rehab sessions at @entity171 in @entity172 are grueling			0
his occupational therapist places @entity175 's left arm in a harness that suspends it			1
the therapist then uses electrodes to stimulate @entity175 's pectoral muscles to move the arm toward his body , then @entity175 must hold it there for 30 seconds			1
his face will strain from the effort			0
" this is my workout now , " he said			0
i go from squatting 605 pounds to just trying to hold my arm up			0
" but @entity17 is smiling even when he makes that observation			1
the smile is almost always present			0
he calls 2011 " the fastest year of my life , " and he keeps himself as busy as possible			0
he is back taking two classes at @entity54 , sports labor relations and criminal procedure , and is part of the school 's radio broadcast team at home games			1
@entity17 always thought he would try to get into broadcast after a career in the @entity202			1
now , he has accelerated that timetable , doing spots on both @entity98 and @entity205 recently in addition to his regular work during the pregame and halftime shows at @entity54			1
exactly one expert picked @entity54 to win the @entity212 title this year : @entity17			1
if the @entity214 , pegged to finish last in the preseason poll , win their final two games against @entity25 and @entity217 , they 'll do just that			0
if they do , @entity17 will find himself in the national spotlight again			1
@entity54 finished 4 - 8 last season , and the devastating injury to @entity17 cast a pall over the entire campus			1
now , his presence does the opposite			0
when he motors around the stadium on game days , fans call out his name and cheer , or stop him to explain how he 's touched their lives without knowing it			0
he is , in a dark time with scandal after scandal in college sports , a ray of light			0
" it 's crazy , " said his sister @entity239			0
" he ca n't even lift a finger but he 's touched an entire world			0

football collision left @entity54 player @entity17 paralyzed
13 months later , @entity175 can move his head and shoulders somewhat
he maintains a positive outlook and believes he will walk again
