-- @entity1 is in for the fight of his political career			2
i 'm not talking his possible run for president in 2016			0
i mean his fight with two far more formidable opponents : comedy and porn stars			1
this battle started last week after president @entity11 called for the @entity12 to back " net neutrality " for the @entity13			1
as @entity11 said , at its core net neutrality means that @entity13 providers can not act as " a gatekeeper , restricting what you can do or see online			1
" @entity1 responded , via @entity21 , that " net neutrality is @entity22 for the @entity13			1
" this is nonsense , of course , but you have to give @entity1 points for trying to conflate the unpopular @entity22 -- which , by the way is so loathed that it has exceeded its goal and has signed up 7.3 million people for health insurance -- with net neutrality			1
although on the other hand , i 'm surprised @entity1 did n't claim that net neutrality is something supported by @entity31			1
you would think that @entity1 , as a member of the @entity35 's @entity34 , would offer up a more reasoned objection to net neutrality			1
traditionally , the debate over an issue like this would 've been conducted in the wonky realm of policy makers and politicians			0
unfortunately for @entity1 , however , it has entered the world of naughty pop culture			2
on friday , " @entity50 , " the comedy website co-created by @entity47 and @entity48 , released a video titled " porn stars explain net neutrality			1
" it features adult film stars @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 discussing the issue in a funny , accessible and provocative way			0
did i mention that they 're naked ? they explain that ending net neutrality would mean not only slowed down social media , it also would result in , " slower porn			1
" says @entity67 : " @entity1 does n't want me to get naked for you			2
" @entity56 then adds a kernel of info that is both poignant on a personal level , and significant politically : " unfortunately , sen. @entity1 -- who is not sexy ! -- has taken countless donations from telecom giant @entity73 and wants to end net neutrality			1
" that video , my friends , is political satire at its best			0
it uses humor to entertain as well as explain the issue			0
now some might dismiss the @entity81 video as " just comedy			2
" really ? this video , per the execs at @entity81 , was viewed by over 1.4 million people as of monday			0
this video has clearly reached audience far beyond those who tune in to watch sunday morning political talk shows or who religiously read political websites			0
and for that reason , i 'd say @entity1 is going to lose this battle			0
there 's a lesson here , not just for @entity1 , but for all candidates thinking of running for president in 2016 ( and there are a lot of you			2
) you should use nontraditional methods , like comedy , to reach voters			1
this is more important than ever			0
why ? well , have you ever seen more people turned off to politics than there are today ? just look at the lousy turnout for midterm elections two weeks ago : just 36 %			0
that was the lowest number since 1942 , and back then the country was in the middle of a @entity116 ! and if you doubt that comedic videos can have an effect on your chances , then look no further than the president 's march appearance on the @entity81 online show , " @entity126 " hosted by @entity123 , where @entity11 urged people to sign up for @entity22			1
that six - minute video , which has been viewed over 27 million times , caused traffic to increase to healthcare.gov by 40 % within 24 hours of its release , and caused a spike in people signing up for @entity22			0
yes , i know some political pundits will tell you that these types of comedy videos only reach young people and younger people tend not to vote			1
these people are wrong for two reasons			0
first , younger voters in the 2008 and 2012 elections comprised close to 19 % of the electorate ; that 's a sizeable voting bloc			1
in fact , if @entity148 had just split the 18 - to 29 - year - old voters in 2012 , as opposed to losing them by 37 % to @entity11 , he would 've won the presidency			1
second , political comedy -- even @entity81 videos -- are n't just consumed by people under 30			0
want to guess the median age of " @entity156 " audience ? 21 ? 30 ? nope , it 's 41 years old			0
and the median age of @entity161 's audience is 42			0
but here 's a little tip to political people thinking of using online videos : have professionals help you			0
for example , @entity1 released a video monday night to counter sen. @entity171 's recent charge on @entity0 's " @entity172 " that @entity1 does n't understand net neutrality			1
the problem with this video , however , is that it 's nothing more than a badly lit @entity1 speaking directly to the camera			2
@entity1 , to his credit , did use props ( an old telephone ) , but besides that the most interesting aspect of the video was the bizarre robot image on the wall behind him and the person standing off to @entity1 's left unintentionally photobombing him			1
the best chance @entity1 has of this video reaching beyond his base is if it inspires comedic memes mocking it			2
obviously , most of those running for president in 2016 will avoid comedy for fear it will backfire			0
but any candidate who employs comedy effectively stands to reach millions of people who would never tune in to hear a politician 's speech			2
and those people could very well be the difference in a close election .			0

@entity204 : video with porn stars mocks @entity1 's position on net neutrality
it makes point that @entity1 got donations from @entity73 . it opposes @entity11 *regulation* plan
he says pols should use comedy to reach voters . @entity11 did with " @entity126 "
@entity204 : young people made big difference in 2008 , 2012 . @entity1 , you should try comedy
