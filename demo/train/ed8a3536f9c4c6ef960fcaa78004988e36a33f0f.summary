world champion @entity0 emerged from his sick bed for a marathon stint in his @entity4 but it was @entity7 rival @entity6 who set the fastest time on the second day of @entity9 pre-season testing in @entity10 friday			1
@entity0 had to cut short his session on the first day as he complained of a fever and his reappearance for the afternoon runs at the @entity15 came as something of a surprise to the fans and media following proceedings			1
he duly completed 89 laps and ominously for @entity4 ' rivals for the upcoming season set the fifth fastest time , despite running on slower medium compound tires			1
the 30 - year - old @entity25 was just over a third of a second slower than the one minute 24.574 seconds posted by @entity6 , who set the time on a soft tire , generally reckoned to be about one second faster per lap than the medium			2
@entity0 's teammate @entity30 had taken the wheel for the morning session and completed 66 laps -- eventually finishing sixth on the time sheets , with his best lap also set on the medium tire			2
@entity30 , troubled by a neck injury thursday , had double reason to celebrate his promising showing as he announced on social media that his wife @entity41 was expecting their first child			0
while @entity4 appears set to continue its 2014 dominance into the new season , it was undoubtedly an improvement for @entity6 and @entity7 , as the @entity47 attempted to simulate race conditions and totaled 143 laps over the two sessions , the most by a single driver on the second day			1
@entity52 -- so off the pace in @entity55 's final season with the famous marquee in 2014 -- has also found encouragement from the two pre-season tests to date and @entity59 was second fastest behind @entity6			1
third best was the @entity60 of @entity61 , with less than a tenth of a second separating the top three			0
@entity64 was fourth fastest in the year - old @entity65			0
with the first race of the season less than a month away from march 13 - 15 in @entity47 , time is running out for team 's struggling with their 2015 cars , not least @entity1 - sponsored @entity68 , with former world champions @entity55 and @entity70 in its driver lineup			1
@entity55 , who has switched from @entity52 , was finally able to get some meaningful action under his belt with a total of 59 laps and the seventh fastest time			2
@entity68 's @entity80 is using cutting edge technology combined with a new @entity68 engine , but there have been extensive teething problems			0
two sons of illustrious motorsport fathers were also in action friday			0
@entity88 , whose father @entity89 raced in @entity9 , was eighth best for @entity91 in his first test at this level			0
@entity94 , the offspring of the former world rally champion , drove for @entity97 and racked up 100 laps although triggering a red flag when he went off and into the gravel on turn 9 at the @entity102 circuit			0
testing continues for the next two days at the same venue and the teams return from next thursday for a final four days to iron out problems before the season starts for real .			2
