-- if the pre-vote predictions had been accurate , football heavyweights @entity3 would be preparing to host the 2012 @entity4			2
it was n't a shock on the scale of @entity9 's swoop for the @entity10 , but the joint bid from @entity12 and @entity13 was at one stage considered third favorite to host @entity16 -- out of three candidates			1
but taking advantage of the hooliganism and match - fixing allegations making ugly headlines in @entity3 back in 2007 , @entity12 and @entity13 stole up on the outside to pip both the 1968 champions and another joint bid from @entity25 and @entity26 to the honor			1
@entity28 , rather than @entity29 and @entity30 , dominates @entity16 storylines fulfilling @entity35 chief @entity34 's ambition of balancing the power in @entity38 football , this will be the first major football tournament in the former @entity39			1
but as early as 2008 , @entity34 was telling @entity13 to " get going " as the building of new stadiums and improvements in the transport network slipped behind schedule			1
at one stage , there was even talk of @entity47 stepping in as emergency host			0
by the end of 2011 , @entity34 was diplomatically describing the buildup as a " complicated adventure			2
" " difficult births often lead to beautiful babies , " the @entity53 football great concluded in march as @entity12 and @entity13 finally declared they would be ready for the june 8 kickoff when an estimated worldwide audience of at least 150 million is expected to be watching			1
only time will tell whether @entity34 will return to @entity35 's headquarters in @entity60 a proud father			0
most major sporting tournaments experience a rocky buildup , @entity12 and @entity13 's has been at the turbulent end of the scale -- understandably so , given the countries ' lack of major event experience coupled with ambitious improvement plans that are reported to have cost $ 38 billion combined			1
five of the eight on show during the tournament are brand new , and the existing venues in @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 have undergone major developments			2
the 50,000 - capacity , newly - constructed @entity80 in @entity82 will host the opening game between @entity12 and @entity84			2
@entity76 's 60,000 - capacity @entity85 , which began life in 1923 as the @entity88 of @entity89 and hosted games during the @entity91 , has been completely renovated with a new transparent roof and will host the final on july 1			2
while the venues have been tested , the transport network will come under scrutiny for the first time when an estimated one million fans descend on the two countries			2
@entity13 faces a race against time to complete the planned 1,750 kilometers of new roads in time for the start of the tournament			1
it has also shipped in high - speed trains from @entity105 to ease travel between the two host countries			2
@entity12 has already accepted that some of its transport improvements -- including the construction of 750 km of new motorways -- may not be ready			0
" we know not everything will be completed in time for @entity16 , " @entity12 2012 communications director @entity112 told @entity0 late last year			1
" but today we can say that a lot of important investment projects will be completed three to five years sooner than without the @entity118 scenario , so i think it was worth it to see @entity34 opening the envelope in @entity122 in 2007			0
" if getting around should be manageable for fans , finding somewhere affordable to stay once they get to their destination is an altogether trickier task			2
@entity127 -- traditionally one of the best - supported @entity38 teams -- failed to sell out its original allocation of tickets for its group games in @entity76 and @entity77 , with many fans opting to stay at home as @entity13 hotel owners seek to make hay from the tournament by ramping up prices			1
in april the @entity139 said fans were being quoted as much as $ 1,000 a night for a three - star room			1
the @entity127 team avoided that problem by choosing a base in @entity145 , @entity12 -- even though it will mean thousands of miles of travel between the two countries			0
if it is n't financial concerns putting off fans , it is the fear of the kind of reception they 'll get			2
the @entity155 @entity154 warns that there has been a recent " increase in hostility " toward gay people in @entity13 and that " travelers of @entity161 or @entity163 descent and individuals belonging to religious minorities should take extra care			1
" the families of black @entity127 players @entity169 and @entity170 have already decided against traveling to @entity13 -- and that was before a @entity173 documentary highlighting racism and violence in the host countries was screened " it 's a major concern , " said @entity170 's father @entity177 , himself a former @entity127 player			1
" i think your safety is more important than a game of football			0
" @entity12 , too , has suffered serious problems with racism			0
" monkey chanting , banana throwing , that has happened in @entity12 matches unfortunately , " @entity186 from the campaign group @entity187 told @entity0			0
" we want to use the @entity193 to highlight some of the issues and make a difference in a positive way in terms of anti-racism education			0
" a series of bomb blasts in @entity201 , @entity13 's fourth largest city , in late april only added to the pervading nervousness over traveling to the country , while several @entity205 leaders will boycott the tournament over @entity13 's treatment of imprisoned opposition leader @entity208			1
@entity209 , meanwhile , has warned of " widespread police criminality " in @entity13 , leading to concerns that any crowd trouble could be met with a particularly brutal response			1
@entity35 has always accepted that giving @entity16 to @entity12 and @entity13 was a risk			1
" from the beginning , it was a big challenge to go to @entity12 and @entity13 , " @entity34 told @entity0 last month			1
" four years ago when all the signs were red , red , red -- stadium , roads , accommodation -- it was not easy			0
" but i say it was a good risk			0
" and @entity76 could witness a historic moment if @entity226 can follow up 2008 's victory and become the first team to successfully defend the title since the tournament began 52 years ago			0
on a lighter note , we await the predictions of @entity13 's " @entity234 " and @entity12 's " @entity235 " the elephant with interest			1
they follow in the footsteps of 2010 @entity10 soothsayer @entity240 in what seems to be becoming a curious tradition at major football tournaments			0
for most pundits , the @entity244 are favorites for the title , but they have their problems			0
record scorer @entity249 and veteran defender @entity250 have been ruled out of the tournament , while striker @entity252 -- who netted the only goal of the 2008 final -- has endured another torrid season for @entity256			0
their competition looks set to come from @entity261 's youthful @entity260 side , 2010 @entity10 finalists @entity263 , and perhaps a @entity265 team that appears to be back on an even keel under the calming influence of @entity268			0
@entity3 , six years on from the scandal that so seriously damaged the country 's chances of hosting the tournament , is embroiled in another match - fixing crisis that led defender @entity273 to be cut from the squad			1
the @entity155 are even less fancied , particularly so among their own pessimistic supporters			0
@entity277 took up his coaching job just 29 days before the first game against @entity265 and has to get the best out of a squad that must survive the first two games without the suspended @entity283 , one of the team 's few world - class players			0
as for the hosts , @entity12 looks to have the easier group with @entity289 , @entity84 and @entity290			0
@entity13 must contend with @entity265 , @entity127 and @entity291			1
for 35 - year - old national icon @entity293 , the tournament is a chance to put the perfect full stop on a 17 - year international career			1
" @entity13 , our time has come ! " declares the team 's slogan			2
@entity35 might be hoping it also applies to the country as a whole .			0

@entity16 kicks off on june 8 , with 16 nations taking part
buildup to the four - yearly tournament has been difficult for the *co-hosts*
there have been fears that infrastructure in @entity13 will not be *sufficient*
country has also been *criticized* over human rights and racist football fans
