-- @entity1 , always good for a discounted pizza or spa treatment , is adding gadgets and other goods in an e-commerce expansion			2
@entity7 , unveiled this week by the @entity9 - based web service , is a departure for the company which , since 2008 , has been sharing mainly service - industry offers with users as it helped define the daily - deals space			1
the move comes as @entity1 approaches a $ 750 million public stock offering ( albeit one that has been postponed amid a turbulent stock market )			2
" @entity7 features really good deals on great products , " @entity1 wrote on the faq page about the service			1
" to get airspace on @entity7 , a product has to be cool enough to share and innovative enough to inspire			0
it also must be made of reliably bonded molecules and stardust			0
" honestly , if we think a product is remarkable and we can offer a good deal on it , we 'll do so			0
" so , presumably , you could score a deal on a laptop , smartphone or other gadget along with the typical sort of offers			0
( we 're holding out hope for the combination headphones / hair rejuvenation system that shoots lasers at your head			0
) if @entity1 did n't have a history of irreverent descriptions and humor ( @entity47 ad , anyone ? ) that would sound an awful lot to us like a line lifted from @entity51 ! , the venerable site which , since 2004 , has been offering ... well ... daily deals promoted with irreverent descriptions and humor			1
the service will limit the number of daily items each user can purchase and , at least in the beginning , ship straight from the retailer			1
all products will be shipped in the contiguous 48 @entity64 states , with shipping to @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 possible depending on the individual deal			0
the @entity7 deals will arrive daily in users ' e-mail , the same way current @entity1 offers do .			1

@entity1 adds *online* retailing to daily deals
@entity7 will feature actual items *alongside* services like *restaurant* discounts
items will be shipped straight from retailers , with a limit on how many you can buy
