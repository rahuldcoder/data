@entity0 , @entity1 -- he 's been there for 30 years , and 85 - year - old @entity5 is n't moving anytime soon			1
but on his stretch of @entity7 in this city just east of @entity9 , he 's essentially the only one			1
" i want to go feet - first out of here , " @entity5 said from his living room , which is now just feet from rising floodwaters			2
" i do n't want to leave			2
i want to stay here because i enjoy it so much			0
" last year , he and his family and friends saved his home from the record flooding that nearly ravaged the entire city -- but it took 30,000 sand bags			1
a farm boy since birth , @entity5 said the sandbagging in 2009 saved his property from major damage , meaning another pleasant year of watching the wildlife in his backyard			1
" i can see turkeys and squirrels and deer			0
they come up at night			0
" but when the retired sporting goods store manager looks down the street now , what he sees is a mix of houses on stilts ready to be moved and vacant houses awaiting demolition			0
the neighbors in the 14 houses to his south and three to the north sold their homes to the city , accepting its offer to buy them out so that a more permanent levee can be built up in their place			2
@entity5 says he 's surprised that so many people made the decision , since some had " beautiful homes			1
" the buyouts were voluntary , but since @entity5 decided to stay , he must foot the bill for his portion of that new levee himself			1
he has n't received a bill yet , but he says whatever the cost , it should be worth it because that mountain of dirt will mean his days of sandbagging are over			0
since the city 's new levee is n't up yet , earthen levees surrounding @entity5 's home are protecting it from this year 's flood			1
" the cupboards are all stocked up , the freezer is all stocked up , so i can stay here for weeks without having to go out , " @entity5 said , laughing			2
and those levees will protect him up to a 43 - foot crest			0
the most recent forecast calls for a crest of 38 feet , so @entity5 says he 's " not worried at all " about staying in his home while the water is high			1
his wife of 57 years died shortly after the flood of 2009			0
but even though he now lives there solo , @entity5 said he does n't feel lonely			2
i have so many friends in town , and every day , i 'm out doing something			0
the phone rings regularly , " he said			0
are you there ? share photos , video of flood when asked how he feels to be known as the last man standing in his neighborhood , the one who wo n't leave , @entity5 said he " did n't do this for publicity			1
" " i just want to enjoy my life , " he said , " and i can do it here			0
