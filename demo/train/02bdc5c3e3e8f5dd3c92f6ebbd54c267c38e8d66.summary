-- like many immigrant parents of @entity4 children who cross the @entity7 - @entity6 border alone , @entity1 is now in agony over what became of her two small youngsters who dared to enter the @entity7 illegally by crossing @entity11			1
for two or three weeks , the @entity13 area mother heard nothing about her son @entity15 , 10 , and daughter @entity16 , 7			1
it 's a silence many @entity4 families in the @entity7 endure , wondering for weeks or even months if their child is alive or dead			1
then , @entity21 finally heard word about two weeks ago : she received a phone call from an " immigration " official in @entity25 who desperately sought the mother 's voice in order to calm her two sobbing children , who were apparently in a detention facility			1
at last , @entity21 knew they were at least alive			0
she soothed her children , but then the june 8 phone call went dead			1
" my children were heartbroken , sad , tearful , crying beyond comparison , begging me to take them out of there , " @entity21 , 25 , said			1
" their begging was so distressing because i could n't run to get them			0
" since then , @entity21 has been unable to track down the detention facility in @entity25 that called her , and now the angst of her children 's absence goes on , day after day			2
her son told her a painful rash was stinging his body			0
" i wanted to run and tell him , ' son , i 'm here and you have me here , ' but i simply could n't			0
i cried and asked @entity53 to look after them , " said @entity21 , who lives in @entity51 , @entity52			0
@entity21 's ongoing saga is the other half of what families experience when children , some as young as age 5 , cross the border alone , with siblings or with other children as they become part of a disturbing new tactic to enter the @entity7 illegally			1
@entity21 has now been waiting a total of one month for an official notice about her children 's status			1
" to be together with them and hugging them and telling them , ' i love you , ' it will be worth the wait and the sacrifice , " @entity21 said			2
risking all it 's a high - risk mission that imperils a family 's most precious asset -- and an experience shared by other parents and relatives of tens of thousands of @entity4 children			1
many children become victims of crime or sex abuse during their unchaperoned journey			2
if the child successfully enters the country illegally , the reward for families and parents such as @entity21 is an emotional reunion of a high order			1
in @entity21 's case , she and her husband have been living in the @entity7 for six years and now have an 8 - month - old baby , their third child , whom the two older siblings have n't met face - to - face			1
the mother has n't seen her two eldest children in person during those six years			1
she kept in touch with them online , through video chats on @entity108			0
@entity21 hopes @entity7 officials will call her again soon so her family can be reunited			1
but such @entity7 reunions are being discouraged by federal officials , who are now streamlining bureaucracy so that the government can hasten the deportations of the children , to separate them again from their @entity7 - based families			1
at the same time , the @entity7 government is providing several million dollars in additional support for the three main @entity4 countries -- @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 -- to receive and repatriate migrant children and other deportees , the @entity121 said friday			1
besides the peril of crossing the desert or waterways along the border , the children are finding their eventual arrest and detention as equally distressful : @entity7 processing and detention facilities are designed more for adults than minors and offer poor living conditions for children			1
" it is also hazardous to send a child into @entity25 to a processing center , " @entity141 secretary @entity140 stated last week			2
" a processing center -- and a number of us here have seen them ourselves -- are no place for children , and to put a child into hands of a criminal smuggling organization is not safe either			1
" i would encourage no parent to send their child or send for their child through this process , " @entity140 said			2
but @entity4 families take the risk any way , with private hopes that somehow they can obtain legal residency some day -- though the @entity166 administration warns that the unaccompanied children or mothers with children wo n't benefit from any proposed immigration reforms or a deferred deportation policy for young immigrants called @entity173			1
central @entity175 treatment what makes @entity4 children an exceptional case is how @entity7 also favors them over other children arrested at the border : @entity6 children are deported immediately , but the other @entity175 children are detained and then put in the care of parents or relatives in the @entity7			1
they are then assigned a court date , but union leaders of the @entity7 @entity189 agents say many families skip the court dates , and the children join @entity7 's population of 11 million undocumented immigrants			0
often fleeing drug and gang violence in their home countries , the children take buses from @entity122 , @entity124 and @entity123 , and when they reach the @entity7 - @entity6 border , they cross alone , with siblings or in groups of children , according to families			1
in @entity21 's case , her children were chaperoned by a relative on the bus rides from @entity210 , @entity123 , but when they reached the @entity7 border , the two children joined a group of other minors , some with mothers , and crossed the @entity11 , @entity21 said			1
@entity21 offered some insight into why families allow children to take such unaccompanied risks : a smuggler charges $ 8,000 to guide two children to the border , but then asks for $ 7,000 more to escort them across , for a total of $ 15,000			1
@entity21 said she did n't use a smuggler , or so - called coyote , and instead relied on a family member to bring the children to the riverbank			0
to reduce the inflow , the @entity7 government is providing millions of dollars in aid to the three @entity4 countries to combat violence at home : $ 40 million for @entity123 , $ 25 million for @entity122 , and $ 18.5 million for @entity124 , the @entity121 said			2
in the meantime , @entity7 agencies are taking a disaster - like approach to what the @entity121 calls the " urgent situation " of unaccompanied minors crossing into the @entity7			2
on friday , vice president @entity243 met with @entity123 president @entity244 to discuss the massive migration of children from there			1
@entity243 also spoke by phone with @entity124 president @entity249 on his way to @entity123 to discuss a regional strategy to reduce the migration			2
at the same time , @entity253 was scheduled to travel friday to @entity25 to review the @entity7 response to the crisis			0
a @entity258 mother 's wait on average , apprehended child migrants under age 18 spend 35 days in @entity7 custody and holding facilities , said @entity263 , a deputy director of the @entity7 @entity264 , which provides the care and placement for such children			1
but some parents , such as one @entity122 immigrant mother in @entity13 , had to wait so long that they began to wonder if they would ever see their child again			1
the mother asked to be identified only by her first name , @entity272 , because she fears for the safety of her two children			2
her 12 - year - old son , @entity277 , and 9 - year - old daughter , @entity278 , left @entity122 with their grandmother in december , and the three arrived in @entity6 on december 24 , @entity275 said			0
in early january , the grandmother hired a smuggler in @entity6 to take the two children to the @entity11 and point them to @entity25 , @entity275 said			0
the grandmother last saw her two grandchildren in the company of other children , some with mothers , near the river , @entity275 said			2
it 's unclear how far the smuggler may or may not have accompanied the children across the @entity11 , @entity275 said			0
two weeks later , @entity275 received a phone call from a @entity7 immigration official			1
the good news was the official had @entity275 's children in custody			2
the bad news was her son was crying , and the federal worker asked the mother to speak to her son			2
" all i told my son is to calm down , that everything will be okay , " @entity275 said			0
then , " the call got cut off , and they did n't call me back , " she said			2
@entity308 son @entity277 in a recent interview : " when i talked to my mom , i told her where i was , and she said not to worry and the phone got cut off			0
" a month later , @entity264 social workers called @entity272 : at last , they arranged for @entity272 to pick up her kids at @entity314			0
the rendezvous occurred in february			0
" this was the longest wait for my life			0
i did n't know nothing -- how they were , if they ate or not , " the mother said			0
" when i saw them , i felt happy			0
they ran and hugged me and my daughter cried and i did , too , and that was it			0
" now that my kids are here			0
it 's worth that risk , " the mother said			0
her two children seemed to agree -- though @entity278 says she misses her grandmother , who raised them the past six years and is now back in @entity122			0
" ever since i 've been here my mom has taken us to different places , she has bought us toys , and she has taken us to really cool places , " @entity278 said			0
" i 'm happy to be here because it 's different			0
" crossroads of hope and fear : stories from a desert bus station @entity346 's journey : how thousands of children are creating a crisis in @entity7			0

parents wait for weeks wondering if their child survived a border crossing
a @entity123 immigrant mother has been in agony for a month
immigration officials often call mothers so that they can calm down crying children
but those calls are abruptly cut without any official *information* on *whereabouts*
