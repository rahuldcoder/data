@entity0 -- in a city as big as @entity0 , finding long - lost loved ones is no easy task -- especially after they 've died			1
for @entity6 , it took decades			1
during a massive blizzard in 1978 , doctors tried to save her newborn daughter , who was suffering from what turned out to be a fatal heart condition			0
@entity12 , who was still recovering from giving birth at the city 's @entity14 , said hospital officials notified her of her baby 's death and had her sign off on a city burial			1
" it was a nightmare , " said @entity12 , who was then 23 years old and later found it nearly impossible to find where her daughter 's remains were buried			0
" for years and years , i did n't even know where to look , " she said			0
" i did n't know what to do			0
" @entity12 did n't get answers until much later , when she met a woman named @entity31 of @entity32 , @entity0			1
@entity31 , 53 , has made it her life 's work to document the undocumented at @entity37 , reportedly the nation 's largest taxpayer - funded potter 's field -- a term used for a place where the unclaimed dead are buried			1
the site , located at the western end of @entity45 , dates to the mid- 1860s , when it was used as a @entity48 training camp during the @entity49 and then as a prisoner - of - war camp for captured @entity52 soldiers			2
but today , its use as a public burial ground is n't always common knowledge -- even to the families of those entombed there			0
and observers say keeping track of the island 's current inhabitants remains a challenge			1
@entity12 said she first found @entity31 by happenstance during an internet search , a part of her unending attempt to locate her daughter 's remains			1
" for 33 years , i 've been trying to find where my child is , " said @entity12 , who said her baby 's official burial records were missing			1
@entity12 contacted @entity31 through her website at @entity77 -- a resource @entity31 created for family and friends in search of lost loved ones , as well as a nod of acknowledgment to the city 's unclaimed dead			1
@entity31 suspected @entity12 's child was buried on @entity37 despite the incomplete records			1
she worked on @entity12 's behalf , contacting city officials who eventually granted @entity12 access to the island			2
though it remains uncertain whether her daughter is buried there , it appears very likely			0
" i started the @entity94 having lost a number of friends to @entity97 in the 1980s , " @entity31 said			2
" many of these people in their 20s simply disappeared			0
" she first began taking photographs on the thin jut of land , which sits just off the @entity104 shoreline , in 1991			0
authorities later made the area off - limits to the general public			2
@entity31 has since produced a documentary about the island and has put on art exhibits featuring her own drawings of its inhabitants devised from photos taken during their lives			1
she is also founder of the @entity94 , a nonprofit organization largely dedicated to informing the public of the island 's inhabitants			2
after submitting a series of @entity120 requests to the city , @entity31 got her hands on thousands of the island 's burial records and worked to create an online database			1
she currently has more than 60,000 records listed online			0
and while @entity31 has focused on @entity0 's @entity37 , many other regions of the country have similar sites			1
in @entity131 , unknown bodies are cremated and buried in a @entity133 burial site			1
in @entity136 , most @entity134 and @entity135 are buried at a @entity138 public cemetery outside city limits			0
but in @entity141 , where some 50,000 deaths are reported each year , about 1,200 unknowns are buried on @entity37 , according to @entity0 's @entity143			1
it is now the final resting place for up to a million people			0
city officials say they 've tried to create a more official database for public users			0
but until that happens , those like @entity12 and @entity151 resident @entity150 have turned to @entity31 and her website for help			1
from an early age , @entity150 called herself a " twin-less twin , " having lost her twin brother , @entity156 , at birth			1
" i knew , " she said , and she pressed her parents until they eventually told her about @entity156			0
" as a twin , you 're born together , but you do n't die together			0
" still , her parents remained reluctant to discuss her brother 's death			2
" it was n't something that my parents liked to talk about , " said the now 38 - year - old @entity165 resident			0
" it was a heartbreaking situation			0
" her mother , who was a 21 - year - old parent coping with the emotional fallout of having a still - born child , also decided on a city burial			2
for @entity150 , that meant @entity156 went missing			2
" i had all these strong feelings that i needed to do something for him , " she said			0
her years - long search for his grave had gone cold until 2009 when she , like @entity12 , enlisted @entity31 's help after finding her @entity37 website			1
using @entity156 's death certificate , @entity31 again petitioned city officials to arrange a visit to the island for the baby 's now - adult sister			1
the request was eventually granted			0
" we do our best to accommodate every legitimate request , " said @entity143 spokeswoman @entity190 , who noted that in most cases , family members must first provide documentation proving that their loved ones are buried on the island before they visit			0
@entity12 's case , in which records were incomplete , was among the exceptions			0
@entity150 said her trip , however , was restricted to a single gazebo overlooking the plots			2
her cell phone and camera were also temporarily confiscated by authorities after she arrived by ferry -- an experience akin to " an excursion on a cruise ship , " she said			0
" we were never left alone			0
" still , the visit seemed to fill a void			0
" she is helping so many people and she does n't know any of us , " @entity150 said of @entity31			1
in october , @entity31 testified at a @entity216 hearing to amend @entity0 's administrative code and force the @entity143 to cede control of the island , arguing that the agency was n't equipped to operate a place that ought to be open to the public			1
" to me it 's a basic human rights issue to be able to visit the dead , " @entity31 said			1
the @entity143 declined to comment on her petition , but noted security concerns and a lack of public facilities as reasons to keep the area restricted			0
@entity37 currently employs inmate labor from neighboring correctional institutions to maintain the graves			2
@entity31 , who sustains the @entity94 largely through donations and sales of her documentary and artwork , says she 's recently received a grant from the state 's @entity239 to create a " posthumous @entity241 " -- a user - generated database of stories , photos and information about those on @entity37			1
since her website launched in 2009 , @entity31 says , more than 2,000 people from around the world have registered to search for their lost friends and family members .			2

@entity31 , 53 , has made her life 's work documenting the undocumented at @entity37
the island is reportedly the nation 's largest taxpayer - funded potter 's field
it took @entity6 decades to locate her baby 's likely burial site ; @entity31 helped her do it
@entity31 also helped @entity150 track down her twin brother , who died at birth
