-- nobody looks to @entity2 opening ceremonies for historical exactitude			1
yet the brutal denialism of the opening spectacle at the 2014 @entity7 should anger and sadden every viewer -- and @entity10 viewers most of all			1
" the struggle of freedom against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting			0
" so wrote the great @entity17 novelist @entity16			0
in @entity10 , forgetting has won			1
these @entity2 opened with a pageant of @entity10 history that excised the crimes of @entity22			1
the @entity10 state refuses to reckon with the past			1
after a brief and partial opening in the early 1990s , it has closed its archives to historians			1
the few memorials erected in the @entity35 years are already crumbling , untended and disregarded			0
surviving victims have received no compensation or recognition			0
the sorry story of this failure of conscience is well told by @entity42 in his aptly titled study , " it was a @entity44 and it never happened anyway			2
" nor does @entity10 society press its leadership to emulate the example of modern @entity48 , where @entity50 crimes are acknowledged , memorialized and repented			1
the victims of @entity53 communist crimes numbered in the millions , but so too did the perpetrators and accomplices			1
they and their children do not wish to be confronted with the truth -- and they certainly do not wish to be held to account for it			0
an apologist for the @entity10 state might reply : " what about slavery ? " ok , fair question			1
@entity65 presidents from @entity66 through @entity67 to @entity68 have eloquently denounced and apologized for the crime of slavery			0
@entity65 fought a horrific war to arrest and overthrow slavery , and it was the foes of slavery -- including 180,000 former slaves and free black men -- who won the war , and whose institutions continue to this day			0
the @entity80 opening ceremony did not have to address @entity10 history			1
the opening ceremonies at @entity83 in 2002 and @entity84 in 1996 did not offer an equivalent pageant			1
but had they done so and omitted slavery , yes , that would have been a scandal			0
@entity80 did worse than omit			0
it actively glorified the era of @entity90			2
what was presented at @entity80 was the equivalent of a @entity48 historical pageant that suggested the major events of the 1930s and 1940s were the building of the autobahn and the invention of the jet engine			1
it 's shocking , and we should not lose our ability to be shocked by the shocking			0
oblivion of the past betrays the future			0
because @entity10 failed to do justice to the old communist apparatus in the 1990s , it opened itself to the recapture of the state by that same apparatus in the 2000s			1
gulag officials and secret policemen were not brought to book , and today , former @entity24 officials and former secret policemen again control the @entity10 government -- and now also own much of @entity10 's wealth			1
@entity119 has held continuous power since 2000 , without ever once facing a fair and open election			1
the @entity10 media are less free today than they were 20 years ago			2
more than 300 journalists have been murdered since 1991 , including an @entity65 , @entity124 , the former editor of the @entity10 edition of @entity127			2
regional governments are controlled from the center by presidential appointment			0
citizens have little voice in their own affairs			0
prosecutions and imprisonment for political dissent have resumed and are accelerating			0
those who gained wealth in the @entity35 years either come to terms with the @entity119 circle or are expropriated or imprisoned			2
standards of living for ordinary @entity10 remain miserably low			2
no beginning has been made on cleaning the environmental disasters bequeathed by communism			0
old - age pensions are scanty , and health care provision miserable outside the capital			0
yet even as the state fails to meet these basic domestic responsibilities , it has resumed the old practice of bullying its smaller neighbors and subverting its bigger ones			0
the violence in @entity26 divides a public that wants to align with @entity156 from an authoritarian leadership backed by @entity158			0
wherever you find an international bad actor , from @entity162 to @entity163 , there you find a @entity10 ally			2
as authoritarian regimes so often do , @entity10 has even taken to stigmatizing and persecuting a scapegoat minority : gays and lesbians , whose basic free speech rights have now been defined as a crime against the state			2
truth - telling about @entity10 's history wo n't suffice to redress these wrongs			1
but so long as the truth is denied and suppressed , the work of correction can not begin -- and @entity10 's future will be polluted , as @entity10 's present is , by the corpses of @entity10 's unenumerated , unmourned and unatoned past			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity183 : @entity2 organizers chose to make opening ceremony a historical pageant
he says by leaving out @entity53 era brutality , @entity10 *glided* over a central part of its story
@entity194 : ignoring @entity53 crimes enables @entity119 regime to cut gains @entity10 made in 1990s
he says @entity10 ca n't correct its ills unless it faces its past *squarely*
