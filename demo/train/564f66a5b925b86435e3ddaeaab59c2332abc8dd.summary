-- @entity2 's forgotten man , @entity3 's @entity1 , gave the galleries a reminder of his prodigious talent with a six - under - par 64 to lead the @entity7 thursday @entity8 won the 2010 edition of the @entity11 event at @entity12 but a shocking run of form since saw him lose his card at the end of the 2012 season			1
playing on an invite from the sponsors , the 31 - year - old @entity8 , carded four birdies and a stunning eagle on the 18th to lead @entity22 , @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity25 of @entity26 by a stroke			1
@entity8 came home in just 30 for the treacherous back nine of the @entity29 as he bids for his fourth @entity11 win and a return to golf 's top table			0
@entity7 latest leaderboard his 263 - yard three - wood approach to the 18th " the perfect number for me " set up his superb finish			2
" it was nice to make it , " he told @entity42 " and nice to see the ball going in the hole , i 've been working hard for the last few months and nice to see the result , " he added			0
it left him six shots clear of defending champion and @entity51 @entity50 , who again battled an errant driver and had to rely on his short game to stay in touch			0
@entity50 , who missed the cut in his first event of the season since switching to the clubs of his new sponsor @entity60 , then lost in the first round of the @entity62 last week , got into red fingers on the back nine			2
but more errant play from tee to green saw him finish with a disappointing bogey six for level par 70			1
it left him on the same mark as early starter @entity71 , who recovered from two over at the turn , to recover to level par. woods had to take off his shoes and socks to play a ball half submerged in the water hazard at the sixth , his 15th , but it paid off			1
he moved the ball forward and his third left him eight foot from the hole , making the putt for a valuable par. but the former @entity51 struggled on the greens and he finished with 32 putts			0
" i hit good putts , " @entity71 told the official @entity11 website			0
" i was getting fooled on the grain , the green speeds are a little bit faster than they were but it 's an adjustment i need to make			0
" on the @entity94 , @entity26 @entity93 continued his blistering early season form , carding eight holes on his way to a seven - under - par 65 and a one - shot lead in the inaugural @entity99			2
the 37 - year - old won the @entity101 in @entity102 two weeks ago and found his form again on the @entity2 and @entity104 near @entity105			1
@entity93 's nearest challenger is @entity107 of @entity108 in the $ 1.970 million tournament			0
meanwhile , @entity111 's bid to make this year 's @entity112 suffered a major setback as the 14 - year - old @entity115 golf prodigy fell seven shots off the lead after the first round of @entity119 thursday			1
@entity111 will be playing at the @entity120 after winning the @entity121 last year on the same @entity122 in @entity123 where the qualifying is taking place			1
but a one - over 73 left him with much to do to win won of the four spots available for the july 18 - 21 @entity112 at @entity128 .			0

@entity1 sets early pace at @entity7 in @entity131
@entity3 has endured form *slump* since winning tournament in 2010
