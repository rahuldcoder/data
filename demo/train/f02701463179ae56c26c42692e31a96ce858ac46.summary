a prolonged undersea search for the missing @entity3 could cost nearly a quarter of a billion @entity4 dollars if private companies are used , @entity1 's top transport official said thursday			1
@entity6 emphasized that the $ 234 million price tag is a " ballpark rough estimate " of an extended search and salvage mission that includes an underwater vehicle			1
the @entity12 is back at work friday morning on a fifth trip into the southern @entity15			1
authorities said the vessel has scanned a total of 110 square kilometers ( 42.5 square miles ) without making any " contacts of interest			1
" searchers seem to be preparing for the possibility that an underwater drone scan of the ocean may not yield debris from the plane immediately			2
@entity28 's acting transport minister , @entity27 , said that authorities are looking at deploying more unmanned underwater probes			1
officials might consider searching along a large portion of sea highlighted by a partial digital " handshake " between the jetliner and an @entity37 satellite , @entity6 said			0
that arc of sea is over 370 miles long and 30 miles wide			0
underwater search officials did n't indicate whether @entity12 's fourth mission was a lengthy one			1
the @entity12 was forced to abort its mission twice this week ; the first time after it exceeded its original depth limit and the second time over a technical issue			1
after the latter was resolved , officials dipped it into the ocean again			0
@entity50 , which owns and operates the equipment under a contract for the @entity53 , called the third dive " very productive , " saying that the underwater drone spent nearly 13 hours at the sea bottom			2
but after four dives , " there has been no debris or aircraft wreckage discovered , " the company said			2
the underwater vessel takes two hours to get near the ocean floor and another two hours to return to the surface			0
it aims to map the ocean floor for 16 hours to retrieve data , which then take four hours to analyze			0
the vessel searches maximum depths of 4,500 meters ( 14,764 feet )			0
the @entity53 has determined the seafloor in the search area reaches a maximum depth of 4,600 meters ( 15,092 feet )			0
bluefin operators said they can reprogram it to operate at 5,000 meters ( 16,404 feet ) , giving it more leeway			0
new setbacks officials believe a recent ping heard in the search area has the right frequency to belong to the flight data recorder 's emergency beacon			0
the quality of the " ping " led authorities to focus the underwater search in the area			1
and as the underwater focus continues , officials faced other setbacks			0
a preliminary analysis of an oil sample collected in the ocean shows that it is not aircraft engine oil or hydraulic fluid , @entity1 's @entity91 said thursday			1
@entity3 vanished on march 8 with 239 people aboard after taking off from @entity99 , @entity28 , bound for @entity100			2
with no debris found so far and no possible pings from the plane 's " black boxes " detected in a week , officials shifted the focus of the search underwater .			2

@entity28 official *raises* the possibility of more underwater search vehicles
underwater probe heads out for fifth mission , no ' contacts of interest ' yet
@entity12 has covered 110 square kilometers in four trips
a preliminary analysis of an oil sample shows that it is not aircraft engine oil
