-- the @entity2 have met with @entity4 officials to discuss possible peace talks , but do not want to negotiate with @entity8 president @entity7 's government , a @entity2 spokesman said tuesday			1
the spokesman 's comments , rejecting a key @entity4 condition , could potentially derail @entity4 efforts for @entity8 to reach a negotiated end to the decade - long war			1
in an e-mail response to questions from @entity0 , @entity2 spokesman @entity15 denied previous reports that the @entity2 had been invited to meet with the @entity7 government in @entity20 , saying that talks with what he called a " puppet " government would be pointless			1
" we have never been asked to attend talks with @entity7 administration officials in @entity20 , but even if we are asked to attend , we wo n't because ( the ) @entity7 government is a puppet and unauthorized , and meeting with them will not be beneficial in solving the issue , " @entity15 wrote in a message from an e-mail account regularly used by the @entity2 to issue statements			0
the spokesman , in answers that he said had taken some time to consider , said the @entity2 wants direct discussions with the @entity4			0
" the issue is ... who is powerful and has got the power to make a decision , and who has n't , and everyone around the world knows that the one who has got the authority in opposition to the @entity49 ( the @entity2 ) is @entity4 , " he wrote			0
the e-mail also contained the @entity2 's first open recognition that they have met with @entity4 officials in @entity53 -- talks that senior @entity4 officials also confirmed			1
the talks with the @entity2 are aimed at establishing what the senior @entity4 officials called " confidence - building measures " to lay the groundwork for negotiations between the @entity8 government and the @entity2 , with the @entity4 possibly serving in a mediation role			1
@entity4 officials have been trying to jump - start peace talks between the @entity2 and @entity8 officials through discussions over the past year			2
the nascent process has been marred by dissatisfaction from @entity8 government officials that they were not included at the start			0
@entity7 's advisers have complained that @entity4 officials were going behind @entity71 's back in talking to the @entity2			0
after initially opposing @entity4 - @entity2 talks , @entity7 has since given his blessing , paving the way for a meeting last month between @entity4 envoy @entity76 and @entity2 representatives in @entity78 , @entity53 , senior @entity4 officials said			1
the @entity2 's demand to talk with @entity4 officials and not the @entity7 administration could throw a wrench in the @entity83 's demand that all talks be @entity8 - led and @entity8 - owned			1
another meeting between @entity4 officials and @entity2 representatives could happen this month , the senior @entity4 officials said			2
the officials said the likelihood of reaching a deal between the @entity8 government and the @entity2 is slim			0
the talks could sow discord in the @entity2 ranks , between those who want to negotiate and those who do n't , the senior @entity4 officials said			2
on tuesday , @entity15 said that the @entity2 sought confidence - building measures from the @entity4 for talks to proceed			0
" the trust - building phase is totally up to @entity4 , " the spokesman wrote , " and they have to take measures and our conditions are as follows : exchange of @entity105 prisoners , the establishment of political office ( in @entity53 ) , removing the sanction lists of the @entity109 ( against @entity2 figures )			0
" @entity4 demands for the @entity2 include requiring them to renounce terrorism and to distance themselves from @entity113 , senior @entity4 officials said			2
@entity2 representatives seemed organized , professional and willing to meet those demands during the @entity53 talks , according to the senior @entity4 officials			1
@entity0 's @entity115 contributed to this report .			0
