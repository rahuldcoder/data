-- art has emerged as a major vehicle for expressing the @entity4 movement			1
in addition to news this week that street art from @entity4 and @entity8 was being collected by the @entity9 , the movement 's arts and @entity12 showcased spoken word performances and poetry readings in @entity16 's @entity15			1
elsewhere in the city , a group known as @entity18 demonstrated at @entity21 's @entity20 , the @entity22 and the @entity23 protesting the corporatization of art , and the " @entity27 " pop - up exhibition similarly represented itself as art inspired by the movement			1
then there 's the sudden popularity of anti-establishment @entity33 masks , distant kin to the masked protests of the @entity37 , a collective of anonymous artists who wear @entity41 masks to protest sexism			0
but perhaps most provocatively , @entity43 -- the artist who famously created the @entity44 -- contributed " you are invited to the @entity51 , " featuring a portrait of a woman evocative of the black power movement , and placing @entity4 within a deeper history of civil rights protest			1
occupy art might just be the movement 's most politically potent tool in its dramatic reframing of the racial dynamics of a populist uprising frequently characterized as largely white and " hippie			1
" @entity43 's " @entity60 " is an especially compelling example			2
it offers an image of a young black woman with turtleneck sweater and iconic @entity65 , a la @entity66 -- the " uniform " of the @entity68 of the 1960s and ' 70s			2
the poster 's retro look recalls a militant past , almost startling in our new millennial moment , and surely is meant as a challenge to the idea that as a society we are anywhere near " post-race " enlightenment			2
for evidence of this , we need look no further than the grossly disproportionate use of force by @entity86 city police in clearing peaceful occupy protesters recently			0
comedian and social critic @entity88 said on his late - night show that the only threat that could possibly warrant such a police response was @entity93			0
his comment , though humorous , was seriously spot - on , for the " beast " perceived as a threat in that city has long been its black and brown citizens			2
it is no accident that the @entity68 was founded in @entity86 , where for decades inequities in health , education , income and incarceration have affected the communities of color there			0
indeed , some have called for more black people 's involvement in the movement , but @entity43 's " @entity60 " goes beyond an appeal for and to black people			1
imagine its even more revolutionary effect as a poster carried by people of all backgrounds and social position , symbolically calling for a pan-ethnic alliance			1
of course some may complain that this repurposing of black power imagery associates the occupy movement with a dated and narrow cultural nationalism with no place in our post-civil rights era			1
the poster 's invitation to an " occupation party " -- suggesting both a political party as well as a hip , happening event -- may not mobilize a younger generation unfamiliar with appeals to rise up or sit in			0
others may criticize the poster as implying a purely token inclusiveness that masks the real tensions between the occupiers ' often competing and sometimes confused agenda			0
but " @entity60 " is powerful precisely because it invites identification with this long history of marginalized people striving for social and economic equity , however imperfect and unfinished those efforts			1
more subtly but as importantly , the poster is a mini-tutorial , offering some much needed direction and instruction to a new movement missing some important elements for success			2
occupiers are invited to take a page from the past , for instance , and go revolutionary with some style			0
the @entity161 dressed for success and worked their cool look to great political effect			0
even more essentially , they also had a plan			0
the @entity166 , which called for " @entity167 " and included a successful @entity169 program , sought very practical forms of redress ( some realistically possible , some less so ) to the social and economic injustices they experienced			0
" you are invited , " with what we might call its black art of occupation , is a reminder of the historical relationship between art and politics			2
@entity185 was anxious about the power of art to rouse emotions and challenge authority , and to be sure , art can be reduced to mere propaganda and demagoguery			0
but we should not forget that @entity192 , @entity185 's own student , disagreed with him , insisting that the arts had a profound social function			1
in 1926 , the renowned black intellectual , @entity196 , argued passionately that art should be used for social justice , that beauty can and must be marshaled for a larger good : " i am one who tells the truth and exposes evil and seeks with beauty and for beauty to set the world right			1
" similarly , the " @entity27 " organizers claim that , " the purpose of the exhibition is to provide a platform for an open dialogue about serious sociological issues			0
" let the @entity212 's camps and protests and marches continue generating such art -- art that inspires interracial unity where it may not yet exist , art that reminds us of the voices unheard , art that galvanizes practical social change when nothing seems to give , art that , in @entity196 ' words , tries to make the world both beautiful and right			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			0

@entity229 says art is emerging as potent tool of @entity4 movement
she says this especially true of @entity43 poster that recalls black power imagery
she says image links movement to long history of marginalized people striving for equity
@entity246 : art serving social function in @entity4 as it urges interracial unity , galvanizes social change
