a @entity1 appeals court on thursday denied @entity4 founder @entity3 's latest request to dismiss an arrest warrant for alleged rape and molestation -- cases that he says are false and politically motivated			1
@entity3 , 43 , has been living in @entity11 's @entity10 embassy for more than two years to avoid extradition to @entity1 , where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another			1
@entity3 , who has not been charged , denies the allegations and says he fears @entity1 would extradite him to the @entity18 , where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through @entity4			1
the @entity22 native has argued the warrant should be dismissed because , in part , @entity1 authorities refuse to interview him at the @entity10 embassy , thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he says should have concluded long ago			1
the appellate court nodded to this argument , agreeing that " the failure of the prosecutors to examine alternative avenues is not in line with their obligation ... to move the preliminary investigation forward			0
" but it concluded that , in balance , the arrest warrant must remain in effect because the crimes alleged are serious and because " there is a great risk that he will flee and thereby evade legal proceedings if the detention order is set aside			1
" " in the view of the court of appeal , these circumstances mean that the reasons for detention still outweigh the intrusion or other detriment entailed by the detention order , " appellate judges wrote in thursday 's ruling			0
another appeal expected @entity57 , a @entity18 attorney for @entity3 , expressed dismay over the ruling			2
" the court of appeals admits the prosecutor has wrongly failed to move this case forward , but refuses to provide @entity3 with any remedy			0
it is astonishing , " @entity57 said in a news release			0
@entity3 's legal team has said it intends to file an appeal with @entity1 's @entity69			1
thursday 's court decision follows a similar ruling by a lower @entity1 court in july			2
@entity3 argues , in part , that the preliminary investigation has been open for an unacceptably long time , and that the arrest warrant improperly keeps him from going to @entity10 , which offered him asylum , or even from going outdoors			2
police stand guard outside the embassy , ready to arrest him should he emerge			0
@entity1 prosecutors say that @entity3 must be interviewed in @entity1 , citing what they say are legal impediments to coercing an interview elsewhere			1
prosecutor @entity84 has said that the warrant could remain in place until the statute of limitations takes effect -- five years for unlawful coercion and 10 years for rape			0
@entity3 rocketed to international fame when @entity4 began publishing secret government documents online			0
after it published the procedures manual for the @entity18 detention center at @entity97 in 2007 , it posted documents related to @entity18 activities in @entity100 and @entity101 , and diplomatic cables from @entity18 embassies			0
in august 2010 , @entity1 prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for @entity3 over the allegations of sexual assault from two female @entity4 volunteers			1
he turned himself in to @entity11 authorities the same year , and was remanded in custody			0
at the time , a judge ruled that he should be extradited to @entity1 , and @entity3 launched a series of appeals that went all the way to the @entity114 @entity69			2
in june 2012 , @entity3 fled to the @entity10 embassy to seek asylum , which was granted in august of the same year			1
he 's been living at the embassy in @entity11 since then .			0
