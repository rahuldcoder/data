-- in retrospect , there were plenty of signs that something was wrong : reports of a naked woman roaming the backyard			2
a child peering from an attic in a house where no children lived			1
sealed windows , muffled screams and accounts of what sounded like people pounding on the walls from inside			2
but the incidents were spread out over years			2
even now , it is not precisely clear who saw what or when			2
attempts to report the odd occurrences to the police seem to have been sporadic , and the police response appears to have been equally limited			0
so , after a while , 2207 @entity27 would lapse back into silence , with no one opening the door to knocks and nothing amiss that a fresh coat of paint could not fix			0
it was indeed so silent much of the time that some neighbors thought no one lived there			0
the house that @entity41 bought more than 20 years ago for $ 12,000 is in itself unremarkable			1
built in 1890 , it is situated in one of @entity45 's oldest neighborhoods , @entity46 , and real estate records indicate that the house underwent a major renovation in the 1950s			1
with a little over 1,400 square feet of living space , it is neither unusually large nor small			1
it has a detached garage and two porches : the front one small and open , the back one enclosed			0
it holds two floors , an attic and a basement			0
if you walked in through the front door that @entity41 used for her escape , you would be greeted by a staircase going up directly ahead of you and a small living room to the left			1
@entity65 ( no relation to one of the women being held , who has the same surname ) walked through that door			2
" he kept his musical instruments in the living room , " @entity65 said of the owner , @entity41			1
" he was a bass player			0
" timeline : from missing to liberated as a fellow musician , @entity65 went inside the house three times to see @entity41			1
he described a few simple pieces of furniture , a sofa and a chair or two			0
he notes that @entity41 kept his bass , amplifier and speaker out in the living room , where he could easily pick them up and play , and that that room led directly into the dining room , and from there , a closed door led to the kitchen in back			1
the house was reasonably tidy when @entity65 stopped by and " quiet ... like it was empty			2
" upstairs , where one witness occasionally saw a woman looking out from a window before it was covered over , real estate records suggest there are four bedrooms and the only bathroom			0
no one who has been voluntarily up there has come forward with any details of the architecture or descriptions of the attic			0
and nothing is known about the basement , which a witness says can be reached by stairs that run underneath the staircase that leads to the second floor			0
a local construction and home repair worker who has been in the neighborhood for years says typically , basements here are made of " unfinished concrete blocks ... or sometimes cut stone " and hold " the guts of the house , " meaning the furnace , water heater and sometimes the electrical boxes			1
usually , due to the sandy nature of the surrounding soil , basements here are made smaller than the houses above , and he adds , " they all leak			0
" police deny neighbors called about suspicious activity that is what we know about the @entity41 house			1
but it is the unknowns that have the neighbors sitting up late , talking , and wondering how it could be			0
where were the chains and ropes that police say were used to bind those three women ? are the stories of padlocked doors true ? were the women and that child kept together or apart ? what , if any , sort of mental games were used to dissuade them from escaping a place that from the outside looks so easy to slip away from ? that last question may prove very important in solving the mystery			1
there have been cases in which kidnappers have instilled such fear of reprisal in their victims -- by making all pay painfully for the transgressions of one -- that the hostages wind up essentially forced to control each other			0
all that is certain is this : the evidence suggests that for a long time , these women were held undetected inside a seemingly normal house , on a normal street , while the homeowner saw neighbors , entertained their kids , ate at @entity179 and appeared perfectly normal			1
that does not make the house on @entity182 haunted , but it certainly makes it haunting .			2

the house where three women were found appeared normal from the outside
but the @entity41 home in west @entity45 was a house of *horrors* , city **officials** say
**officials** say ropes and chains were found inside the home
the house had about 1,400 square feet and was bought 20 years ago for $ 12,000
