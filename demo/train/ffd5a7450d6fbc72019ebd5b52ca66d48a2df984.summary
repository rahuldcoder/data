more than 300 former @entity1 campaign staffers signed an open letter friday morning urging @entity4 sen. @entity3 to run for president in 2016			1
the letter draws parallels between @entity1 's come - from - behind insurgent candidacy and @entity8 , who would enter the race an underdog against former secretary of state @entity11 if the latter runs , as expected			1
@entity13 is seen as the likely @entity15 nominee if she jumps in the race , and leads every survey of the potential @entity15 field by double digits			0
but the same was true during her first run for president , in 2008 , when a then little - known senator from @entity22 jumped in and upended what many expected to be a coronation for the former first lady			2
" we believed in an unlikely candidate who no one thought had a chance , " the letter opens			0
" we know that the improbable is far from impossible , " it goes on			0
the letter declares that " rising income inequality is the challenge of our times , and we want someone who will stand up for working families and take on the @entity39 banks and special interests that took down our economy			0
" it 's signed by both low - level field staffers and researchers and a handful of more prominent @entity1 alums , including @entity47 , who served as chief information officer for both of @entity1 's presidential campaigns ; @entity51 , who was new media field manager on the 2008 campaign ; and @entity54 , who directed the tech field office for @entity1 's reelection fight in @entity57			1
most of the more prominent alumni of @entity1 's presidential campaigns have already signed onto the campaign infrastructure that 's building around a likely @entity13 run			1
@entity62 , @entity1 's 2012 campaign manager , has joined the @entity64 super @entity63 as a co-chairman , and @entity67 advisor @entity66 is expected to leave his post soon and is considered a top pick for @entity13 campaign manager			2
the grassroots organizing group geared towards a @entity13 run , @entity71 , has signed on 270 strategies , the firm launched by top @entity1 campaign aides @entity78 and @entity79			1
progressives remain wary of a @entity13 candidacy , however , and have been urging @entity8 to run for months			2
she has repeatedly denied any interest in a bid , and says she has no plans to jump in the race			0
but progressives are n't waiting for her to make the decision â€” they 're taking steps to encourage her into the race in hopes she 'll change her mind			0
just this week , a major national progressive group , @entity94 , announced a million - dollar effort to draft @entity8 into the race			1
the draft efforts are building as @entity8 continued her ascendance on the national stage this week as a central figure in the government spending fight			1
she led progressive opposition to a government funding bill , sparked by unrelated policy riders rolling back a key plank of the @entity108 financial reform bill and raising caps on donations to parties , and ultimately drove enough @entity15 opposition that the funding fight came down to the wire thursday night			0
the development was an early , but clear , indication that the progressive wing of the @entity15 is angling to have more influence on activities on @entity120 through 2016 and beyond .			0

more than 300 former @entity1 campaign staffers signed a letter urging @entity3 to run
the letter includes low - level organizers and major tech and data staffers
@entity8 continued her rise on the national stage as she took center stage in this week 's spending fight
