-- almost three years ago @entity1 launched a phone called the streak , an @entity5 - based handset with a 5 - inch display that was marketed more as a tablet with phone capabilities than the other way around			1
critics blasted the device for being too large			0
most smartphones at the time were still 3.5 to 4 inches , after all			2
we did n't see many more mobile phones from @entity1 after its blunder with the streak			2
now let 's jump to the present			2
last thursday , @entity21 introduced its new flagship phone , the @entity22 it also has a 5 - inch screen , like the @entity24			1
but this time no one complained			0
in fact , the reaction was quite the opposite			0
critics have been praising the @entity22 's gorgeous display , which is slightly larger than its predecessor			1
and suddenly the @entity32 , which was once the standard for all other smartphones to copy , looks puny next to @entity21 's new phone			1
how 'd we get here ? in an effort to differentiate themselves from the dominant @entity32 , manufacturers that relied on @entity5 to run their mobile devices -- @entity21 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , and others -- began moving towards bigger and bigger screens			1
@entity5 was still in its infancy , and it did n't have the smoothness , app selection , and robust feature set that @entity51 's @entity50 did			0
if an @entity5 phone wanted to stand out , it had to offer what the @entity32 could n't on the hardware side			2
that meant removable batteries , expandable storage , and larger screens			1
in a few short years the trend snowballed to the point where no one scoffs anymore when a manufacturer launches a phone with a giant screen			2
in fact , there are plenty of phones with screens that are dangerously close in size to the growing breed of smaller tablets such as the @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
and people keep buying them			0
i overheard one @entity21 exec put it this way when recently asked if the company thinks phones are getting too big : " we 'll find out at some point , but we have n't found out yet			0
" larger screens appeal to the increasing number of people who use their phones to watch video and play graphics - rich games			1
in other words , do n't expect your next phone to be any smaller than the one in your pocket now			0
these devices are only going to get larger until they reach a point where they 're so big that consumers start turning their noses at them			0
some companies are already pushing the limit			0
at the @entity104 trade show in @entity105 last month , a handful of companies released new phones in the seven and eight - inch ranges			1
@entity21 introduced its new ipad mini competitor , the @entity109			0
but unlike the @entity75 , the @entity109 can make phone calls			0
@entity111 also has a seven - inch @entity5 phone that it calls the @entity113			1
@entity51 did increase the screen size of the @entity32 by half an inch over previous models , but it has n't embraced the big - screen trend yet , and clearly does n't think it needs to for now			1
while the company never gives details on what it 's working on , its public statements do n't offer too much hope that a larger @entity32 will arrive anytime soon			1
during @entity51 's earnings call in january , ceo @entity123 said @entity51 keeps its phone sizes relatively small because it believes that is the perfect form factor for most people			2
" it also provides a larger screen without sacrificing one - handed use , " @entity123 said , referring to the 4 - inch display on the @entity32			1
. " we put a lot of thought into screen sizes and we think we picked the right one			0
" still , @entity51 's decision to boost the @entity32 's size is a tacit admission that plenty of people are clamoring for a bigger phone			1
there have been rumors that a larger @entity32 could hit the market as early as this summer , but it 's more likely you 'll have to wait until next year at the earliest			1
that 's not to say @entity51 is doomed if it does n't get into the so - called phablet business			2
@entity51 is clearly doing just fine			0
but it does suggest that if and when @entity149 do release a bigger phone , they will clearly find a receptive market			0

with the @entity22 , phones with 5 - inch screens are becoming common
it 's a *change* from three years ago , when the 5 - inch @entity24 *flopped*
the @entity32 has a 4 - inch screen . will a larger @entity32 be next ?
larger screens appeal to people who use phones to watch video and play games
