-- basking in the glory of winning back the fabled ashes from traditional rivals @entity3 , @entity2 's cricketing fans turned up in world record numbers @entity9 in @entity10 to see their side continue its domination of the series			1
@entity3 closed on 226 for six wickets , with only @entity15 , undefeated on 67 , suggesting they might post a challenging first innings total			1
two late wickets with the second new ball for paceman @entity19 swung the initiative @entity2 's way to leave the majority of the 91,092 crowd at the @entity24 celebrating			1
the attendance broke a previous world best for attendance at a cricket match set 52 years ago in the same vast stadium			0
" in years to come @entity30 will remember @entity9 2013 as the day their city created sporting history , " @entity32 's ceo , @entity31 , told @entity32 's website			0
@entity3 's loyal band of cricket supporters -- nicknamed ' the @entity39 ' -- also helped boost the figure , but with their team 3 - 0 down in the best of five - match series they came more in hope than expectation			1
until @entity19 's late first day burst , removing @entity47 and @entity48 , who had replaced the out - of - form @entity52 as @entity3 's wicketkeeper , the visitors had held their own , although the scoring rate was pedestrian			1
put in to bat by @entity2 's captain @entity56 , @entity3 made it to lunch for the loss of his counterpart @entity60 to @entity61			1
@entity60 's opening partner @entity62 went after the interval , again failing to capitalize on a solid start to be bowled by @entity66 for 38			0
that brought @entity15 to the wicket and he looked determined to atone for earlier failures in the series , which had led some to question his place in the side			2
he enjoyed a slice of luck , hooking a short ball from the excellent @entity77 in the direction of substitute fielder @entity79 , who could only carry the ball over for a six			0
on 41 , @entity77 almost had him again , but @entity81 could not hold a sharp chance at midwicket			0
@entity15 found support from @entity85 and @entity86 , but both departed after starts to @entity77 , both caught behind by @entity90 , the @entity2 wicketkeeper			1
@entity47 and @entity48 were unable to cope with the 90mph plus pace of @entity19 , a key figure in @entity2 's three earlier wins			2
it left @entity15 at the wicket with @entity97 and just the @entity3 tailenders to come			2
@entity86 , who starred for @entity3 in the summer when they beat @entity2 3 - 0 in a home series , still held hope that @entity15 could lift them into a good position on the second day			1
" with @entity104 not out it 's a good sign for us , " @entity86 told @entity103			0
" a lot of us got starts and are disappointed not to get scores			0
we would have liked a few more runs as well , " he admitted as the pattern of the earlier matches continued			0
" we need big runs and we 've not got them , but if @entity104 and @entity115 ( @entity97 ) can hang around , maybe we will get 300 plus and put some pressure on @entity2			2
" but with @entity19 fired up , @entity2 will look to quickly remove the remaining @entity3 batsmen at the start of the second day and post a big score of their own in their bid to achieve a humiliating series whitewash of their oldest rivals			1
meanwhile in other @entity127 action thursday , @entity125 reached 181 for one wicket on the first day of the second test against @entity130 ranked @entity131 in @entity132			0
@entity135 batsmen @entity133 and @entity136 were sharing an unbeaten century partnership for the second wicket before bad light stopped play .			0

@entity3 226 for six wickets at close of first day at @entity24
record crowd of 91,092 watch the action in @entity10
@entity2 lead series 3 - 0 and have won back the ashes
@entity15 67 not out as @entity3 *falter* again
