-- when an official from the @entity4 decides to take the @entity5 before a congressional committee and is then put on administrative leave , as @entity8 was recently , hearts on the political right surely beat a little faster			1
does this mean that at least one of the controversies swirling around the @entity13 administration in recent weeks will gain strength , perhaps enough to pull him under ? so far it appears that the administration 's trio of troubles -- the @entity4 's scrutiny of the tea party , the @entity17 's investigation of journalists , and the @entity20 's handling of the @entity22 attacks -- lack some of the key ingredients required to brew a strong scandal , the kind that does some serious damage , that produces widespread public interest and intense emotional involvement , and stains an administration , leaving its mark on history			1
the @entity4 controversy and @entity8 drama stokes the sense of crisis in @entity41			1
but @entity42 are hardly alone in discovering troubling developments in high places			1
the world is awash in scandals , partly the result of new technologies			2
in countries where people have long felt they had no voice , the powerful are feeling new public scrutiny			2
the most resonant scandals take an already - existing concern and turn it into a concrete story , one that gets the popular blood boiling			1
to gain traction , it must demonstrate a clear - cut example of abuse of power that is part of a pattern , not just an isolated instance of incompetence , stupidity or poor judgment			1
it must lead directly to a powerful individual , and must represent a problem that is viewed as having serious implications , even if the case itself is not necessarily consequential			2
of the three controversies brewing in the @entity42 , the @entity4 affair has the greatest potential to get the public emotionally involved , because the tax agency has power over everyone			1
bureaucratic overreach feels potentially threatening to all			2
a higher - stakes example can be found in the case of the impoverished @entity85 street vendor @entity86			2
in 2010 , after a municipal employee confiscated his produce , @entity86 , despairing at the injustice and his own powerlessness , set himself on fire			0
it was a minor instance in the larger scheme of corruption and dictatorship , but it sparked a revolutionary fire that keeps burning to this day across the @entity98 and @entity99			0
in @entity103 , an incident that in the past would have passed without notice spread rapidly over the @entity104 , ultimately requiring presidential action			0
the daughter of the head of the consumer protection agency showed up at the trendy @entity109 in the capital without a reservation			0
when she could not get a table , she threatened to have the place shut down			0
officials from her father 's agency , known as @entity118 , promptly raided the establishment			0
" @entity118 , " as @entity124 came to be known , became the personification of the super-entitled member of the elite , a character @entity103 know well and have long resented			0
@entity124 's image , holding a cell phone to her ear and wearing fashionable sunglasses , spread in online parodies			0
last week , @entity103 's president fired her father			0
in the @entity42 , the unfolding storylines are raising hopes among the president 's critics -- and fear among his supporters -- that they will derail his presidency or at least snuff out his second - term agenda			2
they involve unquestionably important issues : the government undermines the @entity142 when the @entity17 spies on reporters			0
if the @entity4 is targeting groups because they oppose government policies , that is a clear and egregious abuse of power			1
and the disaster in @entity148 raises important questions about security and transparency			0
and yet , @entity42 as a whole do n't appear to view these cases as emblematic of a particular problem with the current presidency			2
polls show most @entity42 -- 58 % -- still view @entity13 as " honest and trustworthy			1
" an even greater number , 79 % , consider the president likable			0
that explains why even though most @entity42 consider the cases " very important to the nation , " the approval rating for @entity13 has not suffered			1
this presents a challenge to those who want to see the scandals demolish the @entity13 presidency and shut down his agenda			1
a scandal loses some of its power to demolish when it is viewed as a political game			1
all this , of course , could change			0
an official 's decision to invoke the right against self - incrimination certainly adds to the air of suspicion			1
but when the president 's image does not fit neatly with the revelations in a potential scandal , then the facts of the case , the continuing drops of new information , must have the power to redraw that image			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity193 : controversy over @entity4 official gives hope to those hoping for an @entity13 scandal
she says new technology today helps *unearth* , stoke scandals *globally*
recipe for scandal : high official in clear - cut story that bears out suspicion of power abuse
@entity210 : @entity13 still popular ; " scandal " is n't quite sticking to him
