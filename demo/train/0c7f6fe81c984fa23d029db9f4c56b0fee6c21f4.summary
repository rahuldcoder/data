-- a predicted busy hurricane season this summer is on a collision course with an unprecedented oil spill in the @entity5 , and the results are anyone 's guess , weather experts say			1
" the problem is that this is a man - made experiment we wish we had n't made , " said @entity9 , a professor of meteorology at @entity11			0
scientists on thursday said as much as 19,000 barrels of oil have been spewing every day from the @entity17 well in the @entity5 , making it the largest oil spill in @entity21 history			1
most of the oily water lies off the coast of @entity25 , where marshes and wildlife have been coated and the state 's fishing and tourism industries have taken direct hits			0
not only is it hard to track how contaminants would be redistributed by a hurricane , but it 's also hard to predict how the slick would affect the storm , @entity39 public affairs officer @entity38 and @entity40 agreed			1
@entity40 said the storm could either move the oil along the water 's surface or it could mix the oil with the water and cause it to sink			2
if the oil moved horizontally , the shoreline would be polluted , she said			0
if it moved vertically , the marine life under the surface would suffer			0
the oil could slow the storm 's growth , @entity38 said			1
evaporated ocean water fuels hurricanes , and the oil forming a film across the @entity5 could buffer the water from the air , preventing the ocean water from feeding the hurricane , he said			2
but other scientists say the storms could be stronger than usual because the black oil would heat the water faster and accelerate formation of hurricanes , which rely on warm waters for their development , @entity40 said			2
@entity0 meteorologist @entity66 said there was another threat from the volatile mix of hurricanes and oil : storm surge			1
" all the winds would be coming here , " he said , indicating the coast on a map , " and there would be storm surge here			1
all the winds would be going this way , and there would be scouring and cleaning of the beaches on this side			0
but the storm surge that could make its way up and bring the oil miles inland could be completely contaminating the oil inland			1
" oil in the @entity88 is n't the only worry for hurricane forecasters this year : in earthquake - devastated @entity92 , roughly 1.5 million displaced people are at risk			1
they are living under tarps and in tents in makeshift camps			0
in @entity92 , aid agencies relocated about 20,000 people who were vulnerable to flooding and mudslides when the rainy season began			2
but it is impossible to hurricane - proof the congested tent cities that many are calling home right now , said @entity107 , ceo of the aid program @entity109			0
@entity111 's program is working to provide permanent , stable homes to orphans in the form of polypropylene shelters			0
while her program 's anchored shelters have the greatest potential to withstand strong winds , the outlook appears grim for many @entity123 residents			0
" it 's only short of a miracle to prepare these people for hurricane season , " she said .			2

hurricanes would pile on to problems of oil spill , @entity92 quake *survivors*
storm surge could force oil from shore miles inland , forecaster says
it 's hard to predict how oil slick would affect a hurricane , experts say
oil could slow the storm 's growth , or make it stronger
