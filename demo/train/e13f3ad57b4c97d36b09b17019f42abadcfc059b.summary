-- @entity1 could n't miss when he was part of @entity5 's triumphant @entity4 team last year but his putter let him down when his time came to force a playoff at the @entity9			1
the @entity11 's putt caught the lip but did n't drop meaning @entity13 was able to secure his second @entity15 victory without the nerve - shredding tension of a head - to - head over an extra few holes			1
it took the 37 - year - old @entity22 255 appearances to claim his maiden victory on the @entity15 -- at the @entity24 last year -- but only another 14 to land one of the most prestigious trophies on the circuit			1
@entity13 carded a four - under - par final round of 68 but he dropped a shot on the final hole , opening the door to @entity32 and @entity34 's 23 - year - old @entity33 , who was also one shot back			1
but both players missed with their birdie attempts to secure @entity13 a title he admitted he thought he had no chance of winning during a pro-am tournament at the course on wednesday			1
" it 's pretty surreal , " @entity13 said at the presentation			1
" i played good golf all week , particularly today			0
i got away with murder up the last to be fair , but i 'm very happy to be stood here with the trophy			0
" it 's a funny old game			2
i came during the week to play the pro-am and thought the course was too difficult			0
to be stood here holding the trophy is just mad			0
" it was a nerve racking wait			0
i thought i hit a good putt on the last , i just misread it			2
i thought one of them would hole , if not both			0
i thought it was going to be a playoff , but when both slid by i knew it was my week			2
" @entity13 's impressive 2012 catapulted him to no. 47 in the world rankings -- he is set to climb higher with this latest triumph -- and secured him an invitation to the first major championship of the year , @entity66 at @entity67 in april			1
he carded five birdies in the opening 17 holes to overtake a stuttering @entity32 , who bogeyed three of his first 16			1
@entity32 , instrumental in @entity5 's @entity4 comeback at @entity72 last october , struggled on the greens to relinquish his grip on the tournament			1
the lead was briefly held by @entity11 's @entity77 , a member of @entity5 's winning @entity4 teams of 2004 and 2006 , as he continued his resurgence having been 569th in the world rankings three years ago			2
but an inexplicable four - putt from four feet on the 13th saw him plummet down the leaderboard			0
in a sparkling round , @entity13 's only dropped shot came on the final hole , which opened the door to the chasing duo , but neither @entity32 nor @entity33 could take advantage as they shared second place			1
@entity91 's @entity90 came fourth on 11 - under while @entity93 's @entity92 was a shot further back on 10 - under			2
both @entity96 and world no. 1 @entity95 failed to make the cut			1
@entity13 said he was delighted with his recent form , and to pick up another title so soon after his first triumph at the 2012 @entity24			2
" it 's like buses i suppose , it took a while , " he added			0
" i had four years in wilderness if you like			0
to come through and win the @entity24 was fantastic and to top it off with this has been awesome			0
" as for his chances of winning the masters he said : " you never know in this game , like i say you are stood here thinking on wednesday you 've got no chance and here i am with the trophy			0
" i 've got to keep working hard and doing the things that enabled me to win this trophy			0

@entity22 @entity13 *usurps* @entity1 to win @entity118 @entity9
@entity13 shoots 68 to win by one shot as @entity32 misses putt on 18th to force playoff
rose led by two going into final day but @entity22 records second @entity15 win
two of @entity130 's stars , @entity96 and @entity95 , missed the cut on *friday*
