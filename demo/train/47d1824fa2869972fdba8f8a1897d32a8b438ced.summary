the lawsuit , lodged in the @entity12 district court on wednesday , names @entity3 , his father @entity14 , former boxing star @entity15 and fellow @entity17 executive @entity16			1
" calling a professional athlete a cheater is the most serious charge one can make , " the lawsuit says , " and in today 's world , accusing an athlete of using performance - enhancing drugs -- however baseless and lacking in evidence -- is toxic			1
" the @entity26 fighter , who has won world titles at five different weights , was slated to fight @entity3 on march 13 next year in a money - spinning bout in @entity12			1
but he was infuriated by the insistence of @entity3 's camp that he undergo @entity33 - style pre-fight blood testing and the alleged implication that he had used illegal drugs			1
