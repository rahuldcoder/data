-- rough seas are delaying the connection of the vessel @entity4 to the ruptured oil well in the @entity6 , a spokesman at the oil cleanup command center in @entity9 said wednesday			1
the linkup " may be in place by saturday , " he said			1
officials have said that the hookup is partially completed despite the bad weather , but once it is done it could draw up to 53,000 barrels of oil a day			1
but @entity17 of the @entity19 's @entity18 in @entity20 , @entity9 , says the current " sea state " is delaying the operation and that many @entity9 cleanup activities , such as skimming and flights delivering aerial dispersants , have been " stood down " because of the rough weather			1
he said that if there 's is " a window of opportunity to deploy [ resources ] , we will do so			2
" newly retired @entity34 adm. @entity33 told reporters wednesday it will be 24 to 48 hours before the sea calms enough to finish the linkup			2
@entity33 also told reporters that relief wells must be drilled an estimated 200 to 225 feet farther before they intercept the leaking well bore			2
he said that officials still expect that the relief wells will not be completed until august			2
meanwhile , the number of cleanup workers reporting adverse health effects continues to rise			1
@entity0 's dr. @entity47 sat down wednesday for an exclusive interview with the man in charge of @entity52 's medical response , dr. @entity53			1
he said more than 1,500 workers have sought medical care through @entity52 , a significant increase from previously reported numbers			1
on wednesday , the advocacy group " @entity58 " released a report on oil industry ties among 5th @entity61			2
the report comes ahead of oral arguments set to begin thursday in @entity64 , the case that challenged the @entity68 administration 's six - month ban on deep - water drilling			1
@entity71 's 9 - page report claims that many @entity73 judges have extensive ties to the oil industry , including @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , the three judges who will hear the administration 's appeal of the drilling moratorium			1
the group also says district judge @entity84 , who issued the order prohibiting the drilling moratorium , has financial interests in oil drilling companies			1
oral arguments for @entity90 v. @entity91 will begin thursday afternoon at the @entity92 in @entity93			1
meanwhile , @entity9 gov. @entity94 joined navy secretary @entity95 and @entity97 sen. @entity96 on a flyover of affected areas , including the barrier islands , @entity101 , @entity102 and the @entity103			2
the tour lasted about 90 minutes			2
and in @entity103 , state authorities report that they 've received eight of the nine skimmers produced in @entity108			2
officials have closed more beaches in @entity111 and continue to press cleanup efforts			1
officials say 550 bags -- amounting to 8,250 pounds of oil - related debris -- have been cleaned from a mile - long stretch of beach in @entity118			2
federal estimates say between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels ( about 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have been gushing into the @entity6 daily since april 22 , when the @entity121 sank two days after an explosion aboard the drilling rig			1
in early june , during an exclusive 48 - hour embed with @entity33 , @entity0 's @entity124 visited the site of the oil disaster and gained access to the @entity128 -- the rig that is drilling the primary relief well some 16,000 to 18,000 feet below the sea floor			1
" the intention is to intercept the well bore , well down below the surface near the reservoir , then pump heavy mud in to counteract the pressure of the oil coming up , " @entity33 said			1
" that will allow them to basically plug or kill the well			2
once that 's done , you could do things like remove the blowout preventer , bring it to the surface and try to find out what happened			1
" also , a massive airship , or blimp , and a sea vessel that can suck oil out of the ruptured well are expected to arrive in the @entity152 at the end of the week to aid in oil disaster response efforts			1
their arrival is being delayed because of rough weather , said @entity158 , spokeswoman for the cleanup effort			1
the @entity161 airship will be used to detect oil , direct skimming ships and look for wildlife that may be threatened by oil , the @entity34 says			2
it had been scheduled to reach the @entity6 on tuesday			2
the 178 - foot - long blimp , known as the @entity168 , can carry a crew of up to 10			0
it will fly slowly over the region to track where the oil is flowing and how it is coming ashore			0
the @entity161 says the advantage of the blimp over current helicopter surveillance operations is that it can stay aloft longer , with lower fuel costs , and can survey a wider area			0
the @entity34 has already been pinpointing traveling pools of oil from the sky			0
" the aircraft get on top of the oil			0
they can identify what type of oil it is and they can vector in the skimmer vessels right to the spot , " @entity34 capt. @entity184 said			0
but the problem since june 30 has been the ability to clean it up before it approaches land			0
bad weather has made that task more difficult			1
fears over the spill now extend all the way to @entity203 's @entity202 shores			0
small tar balls continued to wash ashore wednesday at @entity205 , just south of @entity206			0
the @entity34 collected samples that will be tested for any connection to @entity52 's @entity199 , according to @entity210 spokeswoman @entity209			1
tar balls that washed ashore two weeks ago were not found to be connected to @entity52 's oil spill , she said			1
officials told @entity0 the test results from the samples collected would not be available for seven to 10 days			0
meanwhile , @entity215 , spokesman for @entity216 , said progress has been made in testing the company 's @entity219 oil skimmer , the world 's largest			0
the delay from high seas " has allowed us to make valuable observations and to develop some additional technological innovations designed to improve the channeling of oily water into the ship 's large capacity tanks , " @entity215 said in a statement issued tuesday			0
" over the next few days , we will have our first real opportunity to test the new technology under conditions that we hope will maximize the effectiveness of collection and ultimately decanting			0
" earlier , officials said @entity219 's abilities so far are " inconclusive , " meaning the massive converted oil tanker -- which is 3.5 football fields long -- has yet to prove its @entity243 owner 's claim that it can skim between 15,000 and 50,000 barrels of oil off the sea in a day			0
the @entity34 said the testing period for the @entity219 has been extended through thursday			1
meanwhile , interfaith leaders prayed for restoration and renewal for the @entity6 as they prepared for a tour of the oil - soaked marshes , wetlands and rookeries of the @entity9 coast wednesday			0
the @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity261 clergy joined " in prayer and commitment to the communities most affected by the @entity52 oil disaster , " tuesday night , a @entity257 statement said			1
wives of current and former major league baseball players also fanned out across southern @entity9 to draw attention to the people and creatures affected by the disaster			0
the members of the @entity273 -- many of them from the @entity6 -- toured beaches hit by oil and spoke with fishing and oil industry workers in @entity102 on tuesday " the initial point of this trip was to raise awareness , " said @entity279 , wife of ex-big league slugger @entity280			1
" we want to take things we 've seen here firsthand home with us and create our own fundraisers and keep the awareness out there			0
" @entity290 , wife of @entity292 pitcher @entity291 , said she was struck by @entity6 residents who now fear their finances are in ruins			0
" just seeing the people today who are so scared of the unknown , " @entity291 said			0
" not knowing if they are going to get another check , if they are going to work again			0
" the wives will attend a minor league baseball game between the @entity305 and the @entity306 on wednesday			0
the team is selling discount tickets for $ 5 for fishing industry workers and others affected by the disaster			2
@entity312 , wife of @entity314 pitcher @entity313 , is from @entity315 , @entity103 , and will throw out the ceremonial first pitch			0
" this ( oil disaster ) is something that 's not going to affect just the @entity6 coastal areas , " she said			0
" it 's going to affect the whole country with the seafood , the animals and the ecosystem			0
" @entity0 's @entity326 , @entity327 and @entity47 contributed to this report .			0
