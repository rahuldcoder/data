-- it is the life blood for tens of millions of people -- but the mighty @entity3 in southeast @entity4 is now facing a " devastating " threat from not one , but 11 proposed dams			1
irrawaddy dolphins as seen in @entity9 's @entity3 in november 2007 a group of @entity11 has come together to issue the stark warning , claiming if the plans go ahead for hydroelectric projects in @entity15 , @entity9 and @entity16 , that people , animals and the environment will all suffer irreparably			1
under the banner " save the @entity3 " campaigners are hoping to pressure regional governments to shelve the plans , which are being put forward by private companies from @entity25 , @entity16 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity29 , from the environmental group @entity28 , told @entity0 : " these dams , if built , would block the major fish migrations that feed the entire region " adding " the @entity3 fisheries feed the @entity3 people they provide between half and four fifths of the animal protein that people eat here and up to 90 percent of rural communities are involved in fishing activity			1
" " globally the @entity3 basin is the largest inshore fishery in the world			1
it contributes about 2 percent of the global fish catch			0
" the @entity3 is almost 5,000 kilometers long stretching from the @entity48 plateau , through southern @entity49 , and then along the border of @entity51 , @entity16 , through @entity9 to @entity26			2
" even one dam across of the river would be devastating because what we are talking about is 70 percent of the commercial fish catch migrates over long distances			2
so therefore if you build a project on the lower part of the river it does n't matter if you build 11 or one because if you ca n't get past the first dam then it ca n't get past the second either			2
" the campaign launch coincides with a warning from the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) which says that the endangered @entity69 dolphin , also found on a stretch of the @entity3 , is at risk of extinction from pollution			2
the small freshwater dolphins , distinguished by their round heads and short dorsal fins , are already listed as a threatened species , the @entity67 said in a report			0
but analysis of recent dolphin deaths shows their immune systems are suffering because of contaminants in the river , which flows through @entity9 and into southern @entity15			1
" these pollutants are widely distributed in the environment and so the source of this pollution may involve several countries through which the @entity3 flows , " said @entity84 , a veterinarian with @entity85 who authored the report			2
" @entity85 is currently investigating the source of the environmental contaminants			0
" the @entity95 dolphin population inhabits a 190 - kilometer ( 118 - mile ) stretch of the @entity3 between @entity9 and @entity15 , the @entity67 said			1
since 2003 , the population has suffered 88 deaths , more than 60 percent of which were calves less than 2 weeks old , the @entity67 said			0
only an estimated 64 to 76 dolphins are in the river , the group said			1
the @entity3 is also home to 1,200 fish species -- approximately 50 of which are caught commercially			0
scientists say the river has the second highest concentration of aquatic animals in the world , after the @entity112			0
but governments in the region are desperate for sources of cheap , reliable power and the @entity3 is attractive as a greener alternative to coal fired power stations			0
in 1995 @entity16 , @entity26 , @entity15 and @entity9 formed the @entity120 , an intergovernmental body tasked with overseeing " sustainable " development along the river			0
@entity49 and @entity51 ( formerly @entity51 ) are " dialogue partners " but that has n't stopped @entity49 already building three dams in its section of the @entity3 -- a further two are also under construction			1
the proposed 11 new dams are @entity49 , @entity15 / @entity132 border and @entity9 and would for the first time interrupt the flow of the lower @entity3 , according to campaigners			1
one of the eleven projects at @entity136 in northern @entity9 could be complete perhaps as early as 2013 , according to @entity29 , with others following after that			0
the " save the @entity3 " group has handed a petition of 16,380 signatures to the @entity132 prime minister @entity142 calling on him and other regional leaders to act to save " this critical source of food and income for millions of us			0
