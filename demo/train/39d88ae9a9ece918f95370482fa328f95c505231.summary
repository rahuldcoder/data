was hot on the trail — and , er , toilet — of meth maker @entity7 ( @entity9 )			2
and when the revered drama returns with the second half of season 5 ( beginning aug. 11 on @entity15 ) , what should we brace for ? among other things , maybe a bit of self - reflection from the cancer - stricken chemistry teacher who transformed himself into a lethal drug kingpin with the help of high school dropout / partner @entity22 ( @entity24 )			2
" we often said in the writers ' room that if @entity29 had a superpower , it would be not his chemistry knowledge or his ability to cook crystal meth but his ability to lie , " series creator / executive producer @entity26 tells @entity0			1
" @entity29 has been the world 's greatest liar , and i think the person he lies most capably to is himself			1
so in these final eight episodes , perhaps the lies will cease to find traction and the scales will start to fall away from @entity29 's eyes			1
and when that happens , will @entity29 really begin to realize who he is ? that 's a question that we asked ourselves a lot in the writers ' room this year			1
" of course , @entity29 wo n't have too much time for navel - gazing , as he 'll need to keep his eyes on his brother - in - law @entity1 — in addition to other adversaries			2
" there will be antagonistic relationships aplenty , " promises @entity26 , adding : " @entity29 's got plenty of fight left in him			1
and he 's got plenty of forces to fight			1
you met some of them			2
" should viewers brace for a high body count ? " as the movie title goes , there will be blood , " answers @entity26			1
" to my mind , that 's not the most interesting thing			1
it 's the emotional moments and the character moments			1
... we 've got some stuff that i think is going to be truly satisfying and truly shocking and jarring			0
it does not always center on moments of violence			0
" and these moments will come flying at you at " breakneck speed , " he warns : " i have surprised myself at how much story there was left to tell and how quickly we tell it			0
you need to really settle down on the couch and pay close attention because it 's going to come at you fast and furious in the final eight episodes			2
" @entity26 is both cautious and upbeat when it comes to discussing that highly anticipated finale			0
" we worked long and hard to ensure that these final eight — and , in fact , the very last episode — would satisfy an audience , " he says			1
" i am guardedly optimistic that we have achieved just that			0
and furthermore , trying to be as coy as possible , trying to give away as little as possible , i feel like this ending represents on some level , however small , something of a victory for @entity7			0
read into that what you will			0
and try to be as open - minded as possible when you watch this episode , because it may not indeed feel like a victory			2
... i feel good about where it all ended up , and i ca n't wait for people to see it			0
" asked for one last cryptic hint about the homestretch of episodes , @entity26 says : " sometimes you see meth labs in the darndest places			0
