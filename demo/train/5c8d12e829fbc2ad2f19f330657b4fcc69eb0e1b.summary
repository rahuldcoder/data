@entity0 -- painting , simple painting is what caused @entity4 to become a victim of terror			1
for painting classic @entity8 images as a teenager , @entity4 says , @entity11 police -- intent on suppressing @entity8 culture -- arrested , beat and tortured him , shoving his hands into a coal - burning oven			1
" it was like a barbecue , " he said , describing the painful burns on his hands			2
@entity19 of @entity20 says he was arrested and tortured because he organized protests to improve education for the poor and lobbied for instruction of classic @entity25 rather than the local @entity27 dialect			1
police , @entity19 says , shoved a rifle butt into his mouth , forced him to stare at the sun and beat him when he was unable to keep a cockroach within a small circle , using a stick			1
aside from their victimization , what the two men share is a story of recovery made possible by the @entity43 - @entity42 program for survivors of torture , which provides care for victims from around the world , regardless of ability to pay			1
( @entity50 / ) " the individuals who come to us are among the most traumatized and brutalized individuals there are , " said dr. @entity51 , who founded the program in 1995			2
" but they also come to us with incredible resilience , and we have the opportunity to help them heal			2
" @entity4 escaped from police custody , crossed the border into @entity62 and then to @entity63 before finally arriving in the @entity64 in 2003 , a dozen years after his torture			1
" when @entity66 first came to us , he was in excruciating pain , both physically and emotionally			2
he could barely use his hands , " @entity51 said			0
" he would try to paint and he could barely hold a paint brush			0
when he did he would get terrifying memories of the torture he endured			2
" doctors operated on @entity4 's right hand , allowing him to hold a paint brush without pain for the first time in years			1
his left hand , badly scarred , still has limited mobility			0
" just these two fingers are stuck here and i can not open more than this , " @entity4 said as he tried to stretch his palm			1
" middle finger , if i try to open strongly , it hurts a lot			0
" so , this spring , surgeons plans to operate on the left hand			0
@entity4 said he had nightmares in which he was being chased along an icy river			1
the ice would crack and he would fall into the freezing water			0
therapists helped him deal with the trauma and today , @entity4 said , he hardly has any nightmares			1
@entity19 has received treatment for his jaw and persistent back pain as well as psychological counseling			1
but , the @entity100 - @entity42 program does more than provide medical care			2
it connects patients with free legal assistance			0
many , like @entity105 and @entity106 , are able to gain asylum status			0
social workers also aid with @entity110 lessons , connections for employment and housing			0
the @entity114 , in a cramped , somewhat decrepit corridor of @entity43 , is like a international refugee center			0
on a recent morning , a patient from @entity118 was reunited with her two daughters , who had just arrived in the @entity64			0
other patients patiently waited in the hallway to meet with therapists and social workers			0
during its 15 years , the program has treated nearly 3,000 survivors , @entity51 said			1
" we 're able to help them heal , help them to function and get on with their lives , and that 's really gratifying			0
" @entity4 is delighted and grateful to earn a living creating art -- without pain			1
( http://www.samdak.com ) " i 'm feeling really relaxed when i paint			0
it 's very meditational , " said the torture survivor			2
@entity19 , meanwhile , feels victory over his former captors , as he teaches calculus and linear algebra at @entity141 while he pursues a doctorate there			1
without a doubt , " @entity19 said when asked if it 's worth fighting for education , even to the point of becoming a victim of torture			1
" what is living without wisdom ? " he asks			0
" what is living without knowledge ? "			0
