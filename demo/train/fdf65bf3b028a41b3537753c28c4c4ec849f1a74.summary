republicans woke up sunday to a wave of new polls that showed their @entity4 candidates surging ahead in key states -- including one in @entity6 that looked particularly grim for @entity8 -- giving the @entity0 a jolt of enthusiasm going into the 2014 campaign cycle 's final hours			1
two days from the midterm election , @entity13 's political class was buzzing around news that @entity4 hopeful @entity16 was 7 percentage points up in a @entity19 poll , and @entity0 candidates and surrogates popped up on the sunday news shows , gleeful about their prospects			1
" i think the wind is at our back , " @entity25 sen. @entity24 said on @entity27 's " @entity26			0
" he added that @entity0 will " in all likelihood " win control of the @entity4 and added : " i think people are ready for new leadership			2
" fueling the @entity0 ' optimism was a @entity19 poll that showed @entity16 leading @entity38 @entity37 , 51 % to 44 % -- prompting pollster @entity39 to tell the newspaper that " this race looks like it 's decided			1
" hours before the poll 's release , senate majority leader @entity42 spelled out what a loss in the @entity6 would mean for @entity8			2
there 's no other way to say it , " @entity42 said saturday in a conference call with the @entity48			0
" @entity16 would mean â € ” coming to the @entity52 â € ” that @entity53 would be leader of the @entity52 , who agrees with her on everything , " he said , according to @entity51			0
and it was n't just @entity6 that had good news for @entity0			1
a new set of @entity61 / @entity60 polls unveiled sunday morning gave @entity0 boosts in three key @entity4 races -- including @entity63 's in @entity25 , as well as @entity64 , where @entity8 had hoped to pickup a seat , and @entity67 , where @entity69 sen. @entity68 is in a tough race for her political career			1
those incumbent @entity8 have spent the fall trying to distance themselves from president @entity72 , whose floundering state - level approval ratings have been a drag for his party down the ticket as @entity0 tie their opponents to the commander - in - chief every chance they get			1
" this is really the last chance for @entity83 to pass judgment on the @entity72 administration and its policies , " former @entity0 presidential nominee @entity80 said on " @entity81			2
" of course , polls are no guarantee for how elections will turn out on tuesday , as the past several elections for midterms and the presidential race were dogged by major network surveys that turned out to be very different from the actual results			2
and @entity8 cite the 2010 example of @entity96 where @entity0 @entity97 was consistently polling ahead in the final weeks of that race , only to be defeated by now sen. @entity99			1
democrats swung back on the sunday shows as well to make the case that their early voting numbers suggest they 'll hold onto some of those seats			1
@entity106 chairwoman @entity105 said on @entity108 's " @entity107 " that her party 's candidates will benefit from get - out - the - vote efforts targeting people who supported @entity72 in 2008 and 2012 , but did n't vote in the 2010 midterm elections			0
" we have a ground game that i know [ @entity117 chairman ] @entity118 [ @entity119 ] would take ours over theirs any day of the week , " she said			1
she also pointed to @entity69 surrogates -- including former president @entity122 and secretary of state @entity123 , @entity72 and vice president @entity124 -- and said they trounce @entity0 surrogates like @entity127 gov. @entity126 , @entity24 and @entity129 sen. @entity128			1
but @entity119 shot back that " our ground game is whipping their ground game			1
" " look , if @entity83 who want change vote on tuesday , the @entity8 are going to have a terrible night			2
we 're going to have a great night , " he said			0
" and it 's because @entity72 's policies and @entity105 's policies and @entity42 's policies are on the ballot			0
" the @entity0 needs to pick up six seats to win a @entity4 majority , and with several other victories all but guaranteed , losses in swing states like @entity6 could seal @entity8 ' fate			1
@entity4 @entity0 leader @entity63 is ahead of @entity69 challenger @entity146 , 50 % to 41 % , according to an @entity61 / @entity60 survey released sunday			1
@entity8 had hoped the contest would be among their few chances to pick off a @entity0 - held seat or at least divert resources from other key @entity4 races			1
another of those targets is @entity64 , but the @entity0 nominee there , @entity155 , has jumped to a 48 % to 44 % lead over @entity38 @entity157 , the @entity61 / @entity60 survey found			1
that lead might not be enough to clench that race			0
to win in @entity64 , candidates must earn more than 50 % of the vote -- and if neither @entity155 nor @entity157 are able to reach that mark , they 'd face each other again in a run - off election in january			0
in @entity67 , @entity69 sen. @entity68 is in trouble , too			0
the @entity61 / @entity60 poll found her at 44 % support , but in the state 's " jungle primary " she 's facing two republicans -- rep. @entity171 and tea party candidate @entity172			1
if @entity68 falls short of 50 % , she 'd face just one of those @entity0 in a december run - off -- and without conservatives ' votes being split , she 'd be the underdog			2
the @entity0 is all but certain to win seats now held by retiring @entity8 in @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			2
they 're also favored in @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity67 -- states consistently won by @entity0 presidential candidates			2
wins in swing state targets like @entity6 , @entity96 , @entity188 and @entity189 would offer a huge boost to @entity0 ' chances -- and would insulate the party from potential losses in @entity64 and @entity194 , where independent challenger @entity195 has n't said who he 'd caucus with and therefore ca n't be considered a reliable supporter of either party			2
@entity199 , trying to narrow the gap , hit the trail sunday , including @entity122 , who planned four stops in @entity183 -- where @entity69 sen. @entity203 is endangered and long - time @entity122 foil @entity204 is expected to win the governor 's race			1
@entity123 , meanwhile , was in @entity189 , where sen. @entity208 and gov. @entity209 are both facing stiff challenges in their re-election bids			0
she 'll also attend the funeral for long - time @entity214 mayor @entity213			0
@entity72 , who 's stayed away from most @entity4 races this year with the rare exception of a saturday visit to @entity218 on behalf of @entity69 candidate @entity219 , is in @entity220 sunday to campaign for gov. @entity221			0
@entity0 are flocking to @entity194 , where @entity195 is threatening to unseat @entity222 sen. @entity222			0
the party 's 1996 presidential nominee , @entity225 , and former sen. @entity226 are campaigning for @entity222 on sunday			0
@entity127 gov. @entity126 , a likely 2016 @entity227 contender , is swinging through @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231			0
another potential presidential candidate , @entity129 sen. @entity128 , is with @entity0 @entity233 in @entity182 , trying to help the @entity0 knock off first - term @entity69 sen. @entity234			0
the @entity237 governor 's race -- one of the nation 's tightest -- is also getting the attention of big names in both parties			0
@entity124 is campaigning for the @entity69 candidate , @entity244 , while former @entity237 gov. @entity245 is making stops with @entity247 gov. @entity247 .			0

polls from the @entity19 and @entity61 had good news for republicans
@entity0 surrogates took to the sunday shows to cheer their poll results
@entity8 say their ground game and campaigns will close the gap
both parties have their biggest names on the trail sunday
