-- the future of earthquake - ravaged nuclear power plant @entity2 is still anyone 's guess , but it 's already triggered fears of subsequent nuclear disasters elsewhere			1
as efforts continue to get radiation levels under control in the damaged facilities in @entity14 , several countries have expressed doubts about their own nuclear programs			2
and seven in 10 @entity17 say they 're more concerned about a nuclear disaster happening in the @entity17 than they were before , according to a recent @entity22 / @entity21 poll			2
are these fears justified ? what are the real risks of nuclear power , both globally and in the @entity17 ? and what do we do with all of that nuclear waste ? experts say that while nuclear power has generally proven relatively safe , it is important to question whether nuclear plants everywhere could cope with a two-fold natural disaster combination like the earthquake and tsunami that rocked @entity14 on march 11			1
a review of plants in that regard would be worthwhile , said @entity39 , recipient of the 1976 @entity40 and professor at @entity42			0
as @entity14 moves toward stabilization of the @entity2 plant , here are some larger issues to think about in terms of the future of nuclear energy : balancing risks and benefits it makes sense that the public is frightened as workers continue to tame the situation at @entity2 ; people want to know that nuclear power is safe , @entity52 said			1
but so far , although the @entity2 site is not in the clear in terms of radiation inside the plant , the radiation levels outside the gate are still not high enough to do any harm to human health			2
president @entity69 and numerous health officials have assured @entity17 residents that while radioactive particles from @entity14 may be detected in the @entity17 , there will be no health consequences from it , as the particles will disperse over the more - than - 5,000 miles separating the site from the @entity17 @entity78			2
point of comparison : @entity81 , a far larger nuclear disaster that happened in 1986 , is closer to @entity83 than @entity2 is to @entity84 , and no health effects were felt in the @entity17 from @entity81 , either			1
in the broader picture of nuclear power , if you look at all of the risks to human health involved in energy production from all parts of the process -- the mining , transport , refining , shipping and disposal of waste -- nuclear energy is the second most safe , with wind as the only source that 's more benign , @entity52 said			1
when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions , nuclear power also looks pretty good			1
many studies have found that nuclear power 's life - cycle carbon dioxide emissions are comparable to wind , hydropower and other renewable energy sources , and far lower than coal and natural gas plants			1
depending on the technology , nuclear and hydropower have 50 to 100 times lower greenhouse gas releases than coal , according to the @entity117			1
but these analyses do n't take into account the emissions from the mining and transport of nuclear fuel , said @entity124 of the department of civil and environmental engineering at @entity42			1
investment in nuclear power could increase the proliferation of nuclear weapons , @entity124 said			1
also , in his view , the risk of a serious malfunction such as at @entity81 , @entity133 and @entity2 is not trivial			1
ideally , there should be an electricity system drawing from a spectrum of energy sources , with nuclear as one of them , @entity52 said			0
all in all , there are costs and benefits that come with all modes of electricity generation			0
" the public should be thinking about : which devil do you want to live with ? " @entity52 said			0
the international retreat from nuclear power we 've recently heard from the leaders of several countries rethinking their nuclear programs			1
while reviewing safety is crucial , some of the response may be an overreaction , and in certain nations an actual pullback from nuclear energy may be impractical , experts say			0
on monday , @entity165 chancellor @entity164 announced a three - month moratorium on the extension of the operation periods for @entity165 nuclear plants			0
tuesday , she ordered that seven of the oldest reactors in the country be shut down so that their safety can be assessed			0
@entity174 also announced the suspension of development of new nuclear power plants			1
@entity179 's prime minister @entity178 told @entity0 's @entity180 that he does n't think @entity179 will pursue civilian nuclear energy in the coming years			0
" the uncertainty of what will happen is the cloud that hangs over the people of @entity14 , and i think right now , hangs over the world			0
it certainly caused me to reconsider the projects of building civil nuclear power plants , " @entity178 said wednesday			1
this pullback from the international community is expected but , in the view of @entity194 was , nuclear engineering expert at the @entity196 , it 's a knee - jerk reaction			0
some progress may slow in the nuclear power arena as a result of the @entity14 disaster , but certain countries , including @entity14 , rely heavily on it , and ca n't afford to drop it entirely , experts say			1
" in a year or two , the public opinion will still be negative , but there are some energy realities that may dictate the future , " said @entity204 , nuclear safety expert at the @entity206 in @entity84			2
before the disaster at @entity2 , @entity14 had 54 operational reactors providing about 27 % of the country 's power , according to the @entity17 @entity215			1
the relatively low cost of nuclear fuel and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels has made nuclear power popular in @entity14 , @entity204 said			1
by comparison , about 20 % of @entity17 electricity comes from nuclear power , according to the @entity17 @entity215			1
the decision of sources of power is a country - specific one , but power has to come from somewhere , and dropping nuclear power may force a country to buy additional electricity from another country , said @entity232 , assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the @entity234			2
in @entity232 's view , @entity235 and @entity236 will continue building more and more nuclear facilities because they do not have enough natural resources to generate the power they need otherwise			2
" with @entity235 , you ca n't feed 1.2 billion people with windmills or oil or something , not in that country , if you want to have the same living standards as we do here , " he said			0
the silver lining of the @entity2 disaster is that the @entity14 population may demand more scrutiny of the nuclear power industry there , @entity204 said			1
they may ask for more openness and transparency about where to place nuclear power plants and how to oversee their safety , he said			2
" the negative public opinion has some merit , " @entity204 said			0
" people should question the safety of these plants			0
" where the fuel goes can @entity17 nuclear power plants survive earthquakes ? the answer is yes -- each one of them is designed to withstand an earthquake , without releasing any radioactive materials at all , up to the maximum projected seismic event at that plant , according to the @entity278 , an industry group in @entity279			1
but in @entity204 's view , the spent fuel pools at the 65 running nuclear power plant sites in the @entity17 are " sitting ducks in terms of safety and security hazards			1
" these are pools of water at least 20 - feet deep where used nuclear fool is kept to cool			0
at @entity2 , these have been big problems because the electricity needed to keep them cool was lost , allowing radiation levels to rise , after the earthquake and tsunami			0
this used fuel could be extremely dangerous in the event of a natural disaster , as evidenced by what happened at @entity2 , and could also be targets for terrorist attacks , @entity204 said			2
the danger is that the pools could catch fire , resulting in large releases of radiation			0
even if the @entity17 decided to close all of its nuclear reactors tomorrow , there would still be the problem what to do with the spent fuel pools , he said			2
used fuel that has been cooled in a spent fuel pool for at least five years can be put into a container called a cask and surrounded with inert gas , providing leak - tight containment , according to the @entity318			0
there have been no releases of radiation harmful to the public from this cask storage , or contamination , the @entity318 says			0
one proposed solution for long - term storage of used fuel is @entity327 in @entity328			1
president @entity329 approved @entity327 as the site to store the @entity17 's spent fuel and high - level radioactive waste , but president @entity69 cancelled work on the project in 2009			1
various scientists , politicians and others like the @entity338 are calling for a revival of this project , in which more than $ 9 billion has already been invested			0
whether it 's at @entity327 or somewhere else , having a central repository of nuclear waste would be a better solution than keeping it at the individual nuclear plant sites , was said			2
but that does n't address the problem of the need to cool the used fuel for five years before moving it anywhere else			0
perhaps a more important question is : could fuel be cooled in a way that does n't require the pool design ? @entity124 , for his part , is n't sure whether it 's better to have all that waste centralized or decentralized ; it 's just a massive problem for future generations , he said			0
" i think it just illustrates this massive hole we 've gotten ourselves into by developing so much nuclear power at the expense of renewable energy , " @entity124 said			2
the bottom line transparency and a culture of safety are crucial for the nuclear industry , and there should be more international cooperation to promote these endeavors , @entity204 said			0
because radiation travels beyond national borders , it 's crucial to have a strong international collaboration			0
" a nuclear accident anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere because of the traveling fallout , " he said .			0

nuclear and hydropower have lower greenhouse gas releases than coal
@entity2 is further from @entity84 than @entity81 is from @entity83
countries have expressed *skepticism* about nuclear power
@entity327 in @entity328 is a proposed site to store used nuclear fuel in @entity17
