-- the death of a beloved sister is at the heart of best - selling author and screenwriter @entity5 's new book , " @entity7 ( etc. )			1
" her sister , famed writer and director @entity8 , with whom she worked on projects like the film " @entity12 , " passed away last year			1
@entity0 's @entity13 asked @entity5 about writing through her grief , sibling rivalry , and working with @entity16 and @entity17			1
an edited transcript of the conversation is below			0
@entity0 : congratulations , it 's a wonderful book			1
understandably , the passing of your sister and occasional collaborator , @entity8 , has a place of honor : you begin with an essay about her death			1
i recall hearing her mentioning in interviews that your mother , also a writer , liked to say " everything is copy , " meaning everything is material for writing			2
even though @entity8 did n't publicize her illness , do you think she 'd be on some level pleased with you writing about it ? perhaps she 'd be disappointed if you had n't ? @entity5 : thank you			1
my mother did n't say everything is copy , although for writers everything is copy			0
she said " take notes , " when she was in the hospital and she was dying			0
but she did n't say it to me			0
she said it to @entity8			1
to me she said , " i hope you never tell anyone what happens here			0
" so , mixed messages			0
@entity8 always said we shared half a brain , and we loved one another 's work			1
i know she would appreciate this book			2
but she also said to me , about herself , " what is there left to say ? i 've said everything			0
" @entity8 was rarely wrong , but she was wrong about that			1
it was a joy to write about her and it helped me a lot to do it			0
@entity0 : you make the point in your book that there 's no right way or wrong way to deal with terminal illness , even if you 're a celebrity			1
@entity8 chose to keep her diagnosis private , while writer @entity78 went public with his			1
why do you think it 's difficult for some to accept that different people have different ways of approaching the end of their lives ? @entity8 : death is scary			1
it makes people frightened , upset , angry , and sad			0
how could it not ? in @entity8 's case , i understood ... if you do n't tell a friend that you are seriously ill , how shocking and upsetting that discovery must be			1
( friends might ask themselves ) , " how close were we , should i have noticed ? " ( there is ) a sense of betrayal and a desire to have been of help			0
and when people read you and love you through your work as they did with @entity8 , in their hearts they have a relationship			1
or maybe some people are just judgmental			0
i have noticed that people are a tad judgmental , myself included			0
@entity0 : it 's a very poignant and emotional book in places , yet there is also plenty of humor and fun nostalgia			1
you and @entity8 wrote the film " @entity12			1
" who would you rather be stuck in an elevator with , @entity17 or @entity16 ? @entity8 : @entity16 , because she 's more likely to be carrying a bottle of water and we might get dehydrated			1
@entity0 : i 'm a huge @entity119 fan and i got kind of nervous while reading the essay in which you describe a film adaptation of one of your novels , " hanging up , " that she directed			0
was that a bad experience ? please do n't ruin @entity119 for me			0
@entity8 : i am so sorry that i made you nervous			2
in my book i am writing about the complicated nature of collaboration , and about how movies belong to directors , not to screenwriters			2
" @entity133 " the movie belongs to @entity119			0
" @entity133 " the novel belongs to me			0
@entity0 : you write lovingly about your dog , honey			0
is she really on a kangaroo diet ? what does that entail ? because it sounds kind of sketchy			0
@entity8 : @entity144 ? i buy dog food made of kangaroo and feed it to her			2
do you mean , how could kangaroo food cure her tendency to chew her paw ? well the truth is , it did for several months but then , just recently , she started chewing her paw again , just in time for publication			2
maybe she 's having anxiety about being written about			2
she 's a very private dog			2
@entity0 : obviously , " @entity7 ( etc. ) " is a book that 's very much about family			1
in addition to you and @entity8 , your sisters @entity162 and @entity163 are also writers			2
was there / is there much competition ? and how tired are you of people asking you what it 's like being from a family of celebrated writers ? @entity8 : since much of " @entity7 " is about what it 's like to come from my family , i ca n't really get upset if someone asks me about my family			1
in fact i 'm thrilled			0
as for competition , siblings are basically uncivilized			0
my first memory of @entity8 was of her biting into a tomato in such a perfect way as to squirt juice in my eye			2
but , coming from a family of writers , we all take pains to respect one another 's work and feel that we all have a right to write what we want			2
that 's what we strive for			0
