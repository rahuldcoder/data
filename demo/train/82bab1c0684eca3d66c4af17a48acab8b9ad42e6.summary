the uptick in attacks by @entity4 security forces against coalition troops has hit home , with all troops at @entity9 headquarters and all bases across @entity4 now ordered to carry loaded weapons around the clock , @entity0 learned friday			1
gen. @entity13 , the @entity9 commander in @entity4 , ordered the move , according to a @entity16 official with direct knowledge of the orders			1
the order , made in recent days , was divulged amid two more so - called green - on - blue or insider attacks friday			1
an @entity4 police officer opened fire on @entity16 troops in @entity25 in southwestern @entity4 , killing two service members , the @entity9 - led command said			1
two @entity28 troops and an @entity4 service member were wounded by another @entity4 service member in @entity32 province , in the south			0
the order comes as coalition forces adopt and study measures aimed at thwarting such attacks			2
in @entity4 combat situations , all troops are armed			0
but at other locations , only base security forces had been regularly armed			0
those troops have been called into action when insurgents have launched attacks on the base			0
coalition steps up fight against @entity4 ' green - on - blue ' attacks now , anyone who goes to the base headquarters would see that all troops , regardless of their tasks , carry weapons with a magazine of ammunition attached , a @entity16 official confirmed			1
troops now could fire against an attacker within seconds by sliding a lever on their weapons to make a round drop into the firing chamber			0
loaded weapons are being carried both in the open outdoor areas of the base and inside buildings and meeting rooms			0
@entity13 and his top commanders live and work at the @entity72 @entity9 headquarters , attached to the @entity16 embassy			0
the friday green - on - blue attacks follow a claim purportedly from @entity77 leader @entity76 that fighters are infiltrating @entity4 security forces to attack @entity9 - led forces on their bases			1
" many @entity4 in the rank and files of the enemy have shown a willingness to help the ( @entity77 ) in a shrewd manner , " said a statement posted on militant websites thursday and obtained by @entity84 , which monitors the activities of militant groups on the @entity87			1
" as a result , the foreign invaders and their allies at their military centers and bases are suffering crushing blows by these heroic soldiers			0
" @entity0 ca n't independently verify the authenticity of the statement , which was released in advance of this weekend 's @entity103 celebrations that mark the end of the @entity106 holy month of @entity107			2
the @entity77 are known routinely to claim responsibility for attacks and inflate casualty numbers			2
@entity76 also urged employees of the @entity4 government to seek out the group 's newly established " @entity113 , luring and integration " departments that have been established throughout the country " so that they may leave the enemy ranks and join the fighters , " according to @entity84			1
@entity76 's statement drew a sharp response from @entity13 , who accused the @entity77 leader of issuing " an unmistakable message of death , hate and hopelessness for the @entity4 people " on the eve of the @entity103 celebrations			1
" the pride of the @entity4 people has been smeared by killers who pose as soldiers and police , yet they represent the worst of humanity , " @entity13 said friday			0
the commander accused of @entity76 of sending " young brainwashed men to carry out attacks in a fruitless cause , " while he " rests comfortably from afar			2
" " he professes love for his fighters , yet he sends them to their deaths by the hundreds			0
where is the vision that @entity76 speaks of ? where is the love he professes for the @entity4 people ? " @entity13 said			1
" are these not the acts of a deranged man who puts his own goals of personal domination ahead of the future of the @entity4 people ? " shootings by @entity4 forces take growing toll on @entity9 troops an estimated 101 @entity9 troops have been killed in green - on - blue attacks since may 2007 across the country , military analyst @entity157 said friday			1
@entity157 , managing editor of the @entity162 blog , which reports and analyzes terror issues , said green - on - blue attacks have caused around 13 % of coalition deaths this year			1
of the green - on - blue attacks since 2007 , about 40 % of the deaths have occurred this year and 35 % occurred last year , he said			1
@entity157 said there was a flurry of insider attacks early in the year , then a lull , and now a flareup in recent days			1
@entity172 - on - blue is military lingo , with green a reference to @entity4 forces and blue to coalition troops			1
" ' @entity178 ' is always the color of the friendly force , i.e. @entity9 / @entity28 ; ' @entity181 ' signifies the enemy force ; and ' @entity172 ' is the indigenous force allied with , but separate to , the friendly force			2
in this case , ' @entity172 ' is the @entity186 , " said maj. @entity185 , a media officer with the @entity28 , referring to the @entity186			0
the @entity16 military is starting to use the term " insider attack " rather than " green - on - blue " because it 's easier to understand and because @entity4 troops have been victims of the attacks			1
the @entity9 - led command did not provide details about the deadly attack in @entity25 , but a provincial police chief told @entity0 that an @entity4 policeman shot the @entity16 service members early friday during a training session in the @entity201 district			1
police chief @entity202 said two @entity16 @entity204 members were killed and another was injured			0
the gunman was killed when troops returned fire , he said			0
during the gunfight , an @entity209 member was also killed , and another was injured , he said			0
lt. col. @entity211 , a @entity9 - led command spokesman , confirmed that two @entity16 service members were killed in the attack			2
the @entity77 claimed responsibility in a text message to journalists , saying a 70 - year - old policeman killed the three troops			2
it 's the second time a man in an @entity4 security uniform has opened fire on coalition troops in the @entity201 district			1
in december 2011 , a gunman posing as an @entity4 soldier wounded coalition troops			0
official : man in @entity4 security uniform kills 3 @entity16 troops in the @entity32 incident , the member of the @entity232 who turned his weapon against coalition forces was shot and later died of his wounds after he was taken to an @entity28 medical facility			1
the incident occurred in the province 's @entity239 district , @entity28 said			0
the frequency of the insider attacks has prompted @entity4 intelligence agents to go undercover during recruit training to spot possible extremists , military officials said			2
@entity13 said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of @entity4 who sign up for the army or police force			0
the @entity16 government has offered a reward of up to $ 10 million for information leading to the arrest of @entity76 , who took over @entity4 in the early 1990s and established a hard - line islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to @entity259 and @entity260			1
@entity76 vanished from public view after a @entity16 - led coalition ousted the @entity77 and its leaders from power in @entity4 in december 2001 for refusing to hand over @entity259 after the 9/11 attacks			1
over the years , he has refused to be photographed or filmed , and has rarely traveled			0
as a result , @entity76 's appearance has remained a mystery to many			2
those who have met @entity76 say he has one eye stitched shut , the result of a wound suffered during a battle with @entity276 troops during their occupation of @entity4			2
there have been conflicting reports about @entity76 's fate			0
as late as last year , the @entity77 denied reports the leader was dead			0
the attacks come a day after a helicopter crash in southern @entity4 killed seven @entity16 service members , three @entity4 soldiers and an @entity4 interpreter			0
authorities are investigating whether the crash was caused by technical problems or a shoot - down .			0

@entity9 official 's order was made in recent days as concern mounted over the attacks
@entity77 leader @entity76 has purportedly released a statement
in the statement , he says fighters are having *success* infiltrating @entity4 forces
" @entity172 - on - blue " attacks have been carried out by @entity4 in security uniforms
