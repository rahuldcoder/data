the @entity0 may have raised its terror threat level , but the streets of @entity3 do n't appear to be fazed			1
londoners and tourists did not let the announcement friday affect their weekend plans			0
public transportation hubs were bustling , tourists attractions were crowded and visible police presence was low			0
" if you let things like that rule your life , you 'd never do anything			1
so although you 're aware of it , you hope that the government is on top of the situation , " said @entity16 , passing through @entity17 with his family			0
@entity23 , an events manager in @entity3 , echoed that sentiment			1
" you do n't think every time you get on the tube there 's anything going to happen , " she said			0
in response to events in @entity32 and @entity33 , where @entity35 militants have seized a large swath of territory , the @entity0 government increased the country 's threat level from " substantial " to " severe , " the fourth highest of five levels			1
" that means that a terrorist attack is highly likely , but there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent , " home secretary @entity41 said			0
while it 's been widely reviled internationally , @entity35 has managed to attract some support among @entity48 and has drawn foreign fighters			0
even without specific threats in the @entity51 , @entity35 ' track record in @entity33 and @entity32 -- where it was known to massacre minorities , forcefully institute @entity55 law and stage executions and stonings -- suggest it may be capable of anything			1
prime minister @entity59 said the group poses a " greater and deeper " threat than @entity0 has ever known			1
" this is @entity66 version 6.0 , " @entity62 , a former @entity63 ambassador to @entity32 and @entity33 , told @entity64 on friday			1
" they are like nothing we have ever seen before			0
" fears of a @entity48 witch hunt in the @entity0 ? but not all are buying the government 's dire predictions			1
" i think it 's just trying to make people scared really , that 's all it is , said @entity79 , a @entity80 student in @entity3			2
" make people scared and they 'll be more likely to support something if the government then eventually did try to go into @entity32			2
" @entity59 's pledge to crack down on radical @entity85 is leaving some feeling uneasy , fearing that it could turn into a witch hunt against all @entity48 in the @entity0			2
" being a muslim is synonymous with being a terrorist nowadays , " said @entity87 , wearing a full face veil in @entity3 's @entity89			1
" people are scared of what they do n't know most of the time , " she said , " they attack [ @entity85 ] because they do n't know it			0
it 's just part of human nature			0
" " adhering to @entity0 values is not an option or a choice ; it is a duty for those who live in these islands , " said @entity59			2
" and in the end it is only by standing up for these values that will defeat the extremism , protect our way of life and keep all our people safe			0
" " regarding these ' @entity0 values , ' @entity87 said , " i would n't know what they are , i only know what my values are , and how to treat other people with them			2
" kindness and patience and acceptance , that 's what 's going to keep a community together , " she said			0
travel restrictions , an increase in police activity @entity59 said military force is among the tools that can be used against @entity35 , while adding that aid , diplomacy and political influence should also be part of @entity0 's response			2
that said , his focus friday was n't so much about what to do about @entity35 overseas as it was keeping @entity0 citizens back home safe			2
the prime minister vowed he will soon announce plans to stop would - be jihadists from traveling to @entity33 and @entity32 and to make it easier to take their passports away			1
@entity0 also needs to do more to stop current fighters from returning from the @entity147 and to deal decisively with those who already have returned , he said			0
@entity0 authorities estimate that 500 @entity0 have gone to @entity33 and @entity32 to fight with @entity150 groups			1

he claimed 69 arrests in the first half of 2014 for offenses ranging from funding " terrorist activity through to the preparation and / or instigation of terrorism acts and traveling abroad for terrorist training			0
" @entity64 national security analyst @entity166 says @entity0 likely hiked its terror threat level because " there 's no way you can track 500 people			1
" at the same time , he downplayed the idea that friday 's announcement means an attack is imminent			0
" this is what governments are paid to do : they are paid to worry about their citizens , " @entity166 said , noting that the @entity0 threat level has gone up before without a subsequent attack			1
" that does n't mean their citizens should be in a constant state of worry			0
" @entity188 's no ' strategy yet ' comment on @entity35 in @entity33 sparks a political uproar			2

despite rise in threat level , @entity3 's streets remain packed
@entity0 terror threat hiked to second - highest level *due* to events in @entity32 , @entity33
' if you let things like that rule your life , you 'd never do anything '
