one in four @entity1 girls ages 13 to 17 have been given at least one shot of @entity3 , the human papillomavirus vaccine that is heavily marketed as a way to prevent cervical cancer			1
critics say @entity3 's makers minimized the sexual transmission of @entity9 and provided unbalanced info			1
now , a new study says that @entity3 is safe and no riskier than other vaccines , although there is a small chance of fainting or developing a blood clot after getting the shots , according to a study in the @entity18			1
still , many adolescent health specialists and epidemiologists continue to question the benefit of vaccinating all girls against @entity9 , a sexually transmitted disease that causes genital warts and some cases of cervical cancer			0
a related study in the same journal looks at how the vaccine was marketed			1
@entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32 , @entity31 , both of the @entity33 in @entity34 , say the vaccine manufacturer , @entity36 , may have swayed the debate by providing educational grants , ready - made slides , and other materials to professional medical associations such as the @entity42 and the @entity43			1
" much of the material did not address the full complexity of the issues surrounding the vaccine and did not provide balanced recommendations on its risks and benefits , " they wrote			1
" by making this vaccine 's target disease cervical cancer , the sexual transmission of @entity9 was minimized , [ and ] the threat of cervical cancer to all adolescents was maximized			1

the vaccine protects against four @entity9 strains , which cause many , but not all , cases of cervical cancer and genital warts			2
the @entity69 added @entity3 to its routine childhood vaccine schedule the following year			1
@entity3 , which is given in three doses , is recommended for all girls ages 11 and 12 and even for those as young as 9 , with catch - up doses for girls and women ages 13 to 26 who have not been vaccinated earlier			1
@entity58 : top myths about safe sex and sexual health in 2008 , the vaccine had worldwide sales of $ 1.4 billion			1
in the new study , the researchers looked at problems reported to the @entity85 in the 2.5 years since @entity3 was licensed			1
of 23 million doses given during this time , there were 12,424 voluntary accounts of adverse events			0
in all , 94 percent were not considered serious			0
" this continues to be a safe vaccine , " says lead researcher dr. @entity90 , a medical officer at the @entity69			1
" it does protect against the four main types of @entity9 that are responsible for cervical cancer , and it does prevent the early cervical lesions that could turn into cancer			1
this suggests it should decrease risk of full - blown cervical cancer			0

women and sexually active girls still need to get regular pap tests to find abnormal cells in the cervix that may lead to cancer			0
the vaccine does not protect against all types of @entity9 , and if a girl has already been infected with @entity9 prior to receiving the vaccine , it wo n't help her			1
the vaccine has been criticized for its cost , which is about $ 360 for all three shots			2
overall , 6.2 percent of the reported problems were considered serious			0
this included 32 deaths among women who received the vaccine			2
( however , these types of reports can not determine whether adverse events were caused by the vaccine or just a coincidence )			2
there were 8.2 reports of fainting per 100,000 doses and 0.2 blood clots per 100,000 doses , the study shows			1
other problems included nausea , headache , a skin reaction at the injection site , an allergic or hypersensitive reaction , skin rash , and autoimmune reactions such as @entity144 , a potentially life - threatening condition in which the body 's immune system attacks part of the nervous system			2
there was a greater risk of fainting or developing a blood clot with @entity3 than there is with other vaccines , the study shows			1
" [ exposing these risks ] should open the dialogue that people need to have with their physician about whether they need to get the vaccine , " @entity156 said			2
however , advertisements for the vaccine heavily promote its ability to prevent cervical cancer			0
dr. @entity166 , the editor in chief of the @entity168 , noted in an editorial that @entity9 is not always harmful and that most women with healthy immune systems can and will clear it on their own			0
" in a few women , infection persisted and some women may develop precancerous cervical lesions and eventually cervical cancer , " she wrote			0
" it is currently impossible to predict in which women this will occur and why			0
likewise , it is impossible to predict exactly what effect the vaccination of young girls and women will have on the incidence of cervical cancer 20 to 40 years from now			0
" the bottom line , according to dr. @entity166 ? " even if persistently infected with @entity9 , a woman most likely will not develop cancer if she is regularly screened			0
so rationally she should be willing to accept only a small risk of harmful effects from the vaccine , " she said in the editorial			0
@entity58 : how to deal with 7 of the most common birth control side effects @entity198 , a professor of epidemiology at @entity200 , in @entity201 , has publically questioned whether @entity202 is rushing too quickly to recommend the vaccine for all girls and young women			0
" if we want to get rid of cervical cancer , let 's know what we are doing before we start launching a vaccine , " said @entity198 , who is also the past chair of the @entity207			2
she said she would rather see campaigns aimed at improving access to @entity216 tests in at - risk populations			0
" i am not alarmed about the safety , but we have to ask hard questions about the real benefits , " she said			0
" we do n't know how long protection will last , and we wo n't know if the vaccine protects against cancer for a while			2
