-- get ready to hear a lot more from @entity2			1
the rapper , born @entity2 , has been making waves lately -- from rumors of an alleged sex tape with touring buddy @entity6 that the singer has dismissed as nonsense to a guest verse on the video for @entity12 's latest single , " party			1
" not too shabby for a guy who only a few years ago was graduating magna cum laude from @entity15 in @entity16			2
the up - and - coming artist -- who was one of the first signed to @entity20 's @entity19 label -- recently spoke with @entity0 about his album , " @entity22 : the @entity27 , " why he needs to watch his jump shot , and who he rocks on his playlist			1
@entity0 : you 've done a bunch of mixtapes and had a few false starts before " @entity22 " finally was released			2
how does it feel now that it 's out , and the debut was so big ? @entity2 : it 's probably one of the best feelings i 've had in a long time			1
i 've been carrying this since 2007 , since right around when i was about to graduate college			2
in school , everything was a blur : fun , then partying , then homework , then rinse and repeat			2
then graduation hit me , and i was like , ' oh , snap			2
' from that time in 2007 , until right now , my life has been full of stress like you ca n't believe			0
one moment after another of : ' i got ta get this record deal			0
oh , @entity20 likes me , how do i get him to sign ? he signed me ! oh s * * t , now i got ta put out an album			1
i finished the album -- now i got ta drop a single ! ' the past three years have been filled with that stress for me , like i 've been under a constant heavy weight , a heavy burden			0
i do n't jump out of bed every day and scream " yeah ! " but the relief is a great feeling			0
i feel free , for the first time in a long time			0
@entity0 : what 's been your favorite night of the tour so far ? @entity2 : this has definitely been one of the best shows i 've done so far , just in terms of my performance and the crowd , the energy			1
i 've had so many good shows on this tour so far			1
like , legendary - feeling shows , so many sold - out dates			0
@entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 -- so many of these places were showing me so much love			0
being on tour after dropping the album and doing all these crazy shows has probably been one of the best periods in my life			1
@entity0 : that brace on your foot -- how did that happen ? was it a tour injury ? @entity2 : in @entity97 , the night before a show , i just wanted to play basketball			1
i went to some 24 - hour fitness center and got together some people for four - on - four			0
i pulled out for a jump shot , but some dude stepped in front of me and jammed on my ankle			0
the recovery time has been incredible though			0
i do n't even really need the brace anymore			0
it 's just for safety			1
@entity0 : one thing that 's been big on your mixtapes and " @entity22 " is how you favor electronic , almost video game - like beats and melodies			1
where does that come from ? @entity2 : i do n't know what it is			1
it 's not really a conscious thing , like i 'm thinking my raps should sound like i 'm in a video game			1
i just really love that sound			0
but yeah , if you listen to , say , ' @entity125 , ' you can definitely hear a video game - synth type of sound			1
i really dig that kind of production			0
@entity0 : what 's on your playlist when you 're traveling from city to city ? @entity2 : now that i 've got more free time , i 'm getting my @entity136 right , getting some playlists together			1
i 'm all over the place			0
one day , i 'll be listening to a bunch of @entity140 , the next day it 's nothing but @entity142			1
the next day it might be @entity144 all day			0
@entity146 , @entity147 , it 's all in there			1
lately , i 'll play what i 'm working on before the show			0
like , i 'm working on a beat , and then i 'll pause it before the show so that when i come back to the bus and hit play i can get right back into that energy			0
@entity0 : how does it feel to be headlining your own tour now after opening for @entity20 and @entity6 's tours ? @entity2 : there was a lot less pressure on me as an opener obviously			1
in that situation , it 's almost like you 're there to steal fans from the headliner , steal a little bit of the spotlight and make them your fans , too			2
when you 're headlining , people are paying to come see you specifically			2
it 's a different kind of pressure , because you 've got to deliver			2
you 've got to give these people what they paid for			0
it 's a different mind state , a different type of mentality , but it 's honestly a pretty good problem to have , you know ?			2
