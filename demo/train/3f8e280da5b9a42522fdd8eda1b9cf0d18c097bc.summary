@entity0 -- furniture from the rented mansion where pop star @entity4 died was being auctioned off saturday , and among the most expensive items sold were paintings that went for $ 46,875 and $ 35,200			1
some of the furnishings were made infamous by crime scene photos shown in this year 's trial of @entity4 's doctor , @entity10 , who was sentenced last month to four years in the @entity12 jail for involuntary manslaughter in @entity4 's death			1
though the mansion is located in @entity0 ' @entity17 neighborhood , the auction was being held in @entity18 and was being carried live online			0
auctioneers were selling 524 items			1
@entity4 did not own the beds , chairs , clocks , paintings , dishes and other objects , but their value was expected to skyrocket because of the personal touch added by the pop icon and his children in the months before he died on june 25 , 2009			1
@entity32 has been careful not to call it a @entity4 auction out of legal and public relations concerns , instead marketing it by the mansion 's now - famous address -- 100 @entity38			1
as of early saturday afternoon , among the most expensive items sold were a $ 35,200 watercolor painting of floral still life by @entity41 and a $ 46,875 oil painting of fishing village by @entity44			0
the table where @entity4 's sedatives sat and the rug on which paramedics tried to revive him are also among the items on the sale block			1
without the connection to @entity4 , the entire property might bring $ 400,000 , @entity51 said			0
but with the connection , " the sky 's the limit , " @entity54 's executive director @entity51 said			0
a chalkboard left behind in @entity4 's kitchen may have cost a few hundred dollars , but what his children wrote on it makes it a very valuable object , @entity51 said			1
the note , handwritten on the black board attached to a 26 - inch - tall ceramic rooster , reads " love @entity66 / i ( heart ) @entity66 / smile it 's for free			0
" it sat in the kitchen where , according to testimony in the trial of @entity10 , @entity4 would eat lunch each day with @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
it was not known which child wrote the chalk note , but @entity51 said his research suggested it was from @entity76 , who was 11 when her father died			0
another striking piece is a @entity87 - revival - style armoire from @entity4 's master bedroom			1
on the mirror , presumably where @entity4 looked each day as he dressed , is a handwritten message of inspiration : " train , perfection march april full out may			0
" the wax - pencil note is significant , considering that @entity4 was battling the calendar as he prepared for his " @entity99 " concerts set to premiere in @entity98 in july 2009			2
@entity10 's defense lawyers argued during the trial that the intense pressure on @entity4 to rehearse for the 50 shows put him in a desperate fight for sleep , which led to @entity10 administering the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night in the last two months of his life			2
@entity32 backed away from selling the bed in which @entity4 received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother , @entity111 , @entity51 said			2
the auction house 's re-creation of the bedroom where @entity4 died -- euphemistically called " the medicine room " by the company -- features a bed - sized memorial covered with love notes from @entity4 fans instead of the death bed			2
the nightstand seen next to the death bed in coroner 's photos , bearing numerous bottles of sedatives and other drugs , is for sale			0
the " @entity130 occasional table " is listed for between $ 300 and $ 500			0
the room - size oriental rug that covered the floor where @entity4 was placed when paramedics tried to revive him is listed in the auction catalog for between $ 400 and $ 600			0
the couch and chairs where @entity4 likely sat with show producers worried about his health in the days before his death are for sale			0
one chair in @entity4 's bedroom has a stain which @entity51 suggested was makeup spilled by the star as he sat in front of a mirror			2
none of @entity4 's relatives has expressed an interest in any of the items , @entity51 said			1
he pointed out that they had a chance to take whatever they wanted from the house in the months after his death			0
the notes and posters brought to the auction house by @entity4 fans and placed on the " medicine room " memorial will be sent to @entity4 's mother and children , he said			1
@entity4 's relationship with @entity54 's turned sour in the last months of his life when he filed a lawsuit to stop the sale of furnishings from his neverland ranch			1
the singer sued the auction company , claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from @entity169 after he sold the ranch			0
the suit was settled in april 2009 when @entity54 's canceled the auction and later returned the items to @entity4 .			1

two paintings sell for thousands of dollars
auction is selling 524 items from rented mansion where pop icon died in 2009
some furnishings were shown in photos during trial of @entity4 's doctor
@entity4 did *n't* own the furnishings , but his use of them should raise prices
