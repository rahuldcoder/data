@entity0 -- the new @entity3 government , formed after four days of horse - trading by three party leaders , is the country 's first coalition in 60 years			1
since 1952 , a combination of electoral systems and political polarization produced a comfortable single party majority every time an election was held in @entity3			1
this glorified tradition was supposed to provide the country with stable governments and strong leadership , as two big parties were alternating in power			0
but after 60 years -- or at least 38 , counting from the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1974 -- it has provided the country with an ossified political class , inept public service , deep - routed clientelism and omnipresent corruption			1
a retired public servant once described to me the process : " when parties alternate in power after an election , what goes on in the public service is a hand over from one mafia organization to its rival			0
" ministers walk into their fiefs , escorted by dozens of political counselors who take over from the counselors of the previous minister and do the job , instead of the top public servants , who are discarded , unless they are party loyalists			2
public service has thus become gradually annexed to a party system , distributing the spoils of power			2
@entity50 has been subdued to party leaders , as members of the majority usually express loyalty to the leader , waiting their turn for a ministerial post			0
justice has been also partly subdued : since the heads of the three supreme courts are chosen by the government , career judges learn that they have to have friends in politics , if they wish to have a chance at the top jobs			0
the result of decades of single party majorities was a special brand of democratic regime			0
let 's call it " partitocracy : " two big parties running the country -- and killing it softly , by bribing it to its death			0
does this explain @entity3 's present economic woes ? in part , yes			2
@entity3 was the first victim of a euro - wide crisis , which would have hit its small , open , vulnerable economy even if the country were run by the wisest of men with the integrity of monks			1
but partitocracy has certainly precipitated the crisis , made @entity3 the hardest hit among all peripheral economies and , most importantly , made it almost impossible for @entity3 to reform itself out of the crisis			1
public service reform , tax collection reform , electoral law reform are made impossible , because an unreformed party system would always treat reform as a deadly threats			1
so , yes ! forming a coalition government , with intra-party checks and balances and the presence of a newcomer , a party that has not participated as yet in corrupt party politics , might be good news for the country			1
i am not sure the new government will prove able to negotiate a better deal with its @entity109 partners or lucky enough to live through a change in the core @entity109 policies that will address the fundamentals of the euro crisis			0
but i hope that at least it can rid @entity3 of its main plague : partitocracy .			0
