-- the @entity2 presidential candidates are preening and prancing throughout the @entity3 in the hopes of winning the state 's 50 precious delegates			0
out in @entity7 , another kind of campaign -- one with prettier people , with better hair , but equally sharp nails -- will rage over the next three weeks for @entity13			1
the comparison is apt in the vast sums of money spent , the lobbyists hired , and the number of backsides kissed in order for studios to ensure their films pick up @entity13 at the end of the campaign season , capped by a red carpet of triumph and tears the evening of february 26			1
to that end , studios spend millions of dollars to make sure their projects take home those little gold men			0
as in the presidential race , we 've seen primaries leading up to the main event			0
candidates were given tacit endorsements at the @entity37 and again at sunday evening 's @entity38			0
after " @entity41 " took home a surprise win at the @entity38 , the race for @entity40 has narrowed to that film and " @entity45 " and " the artist , " both big winners at the @entity37			0
for the next few weeks , until the close of @entity13 voting on the sunday before the @entity13 , the studios and distributors behind those three pictures -- @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , respectively -- will be aggressively wooing the @entity13 's 6,000 members into their camps			0
as in a political campaign , you simply can not win an @entity13 without spending money			1
it does n't matter who spends the most , but it does matter who spends it best			0
one of the better campaigns of the past five years was the 2010 win for the little war flick that could : " the @entity68			0
" despite its critical acclaim and high - quality cinematography and script , it was the lowest - grossing best picture winner of all time , competing against the highest - grossing movie in recent history , " @entity77			1
" besides quality , of course , what did it have going for it ? one hell of an @entity13 campaign			1
its studio , @entity84 , was flush with vampire money from the " @entity88 " series			0
@entity13 watchers , including studio executives , film journalists and fellow @entity13 campaigners , told me that @entity84 spent between $ 3 million and $ 5 million for the campaign , which consisted mainly of hiring consultants to spin " @entity68 " and " @entity77 " in a battle of good versus evil within the press			1
" @entity68 " actually lost out to " @entity77 " in the @entity37 race , and that might have been a well - timed boon for the small flick			1
it positioned it perfectly as the underdog going into the home stretch of the campaign			2
besides the cachet of an @entity13 win , the successful campaign typically pays for itself in dividends			2
in the nine months after " the @entity68 's " @entity13 win , the film sold more than $ 31 million worth of dvds in the @entity115 , 214 % of its @entity115 box office gross of $ 14.7 million			1
that 's what makes @entity13 campaigning more than a $ 100 million - a - year cottage industry within the movie industry			1
persuading members of the @entity13 to first nominate your film and then vote for it is tremendously similar to how political operatives get candidates elected			0
there is no single strategy for a successful @entity13 campaign , but momentum is key			2
peak too early and excitement peters out ; peak too late and you 've spent millions of dollars without enough time to get voters invested			0
building momentum involves racking up accolades and awards from individual guilds and film festivals before the nomination voting in january			0
this year @entity142 is making sure " @entity144 " gathers momentum at just the right time			2
it took home a @entity37 and its lead actor , @entity148 , brought home a best actor @entity38			0
but it has yet to peak			0
how is momentum built ? and why does it cost millions ? after all , word of mouth is free			2
but an intricate web of gypsy publicists , rogue party planners , and entire full - service consultancies to generate that all - important buzz that drives a campaign can run more than $ 2 million			1
sure , a dvd can be mailed for less than $ 2			2
but with elaborate packaging , express mailing and hand delivery , the cost can increase to $ 200 each			1
with 6,000 @entity13 members , that translates to more than $ 1 million to get the films in front of voters			1
one of the stealthier tactics of good campaigners is the third - party @entity173 , where someone who is not in the @entity13 hosts an event celebrating a film starring one of their good friends			1
the expenses for these can easily run to $ 2 million , which is often somehow subsidized by the studio			1
like a good show - pony politician , the cast of a film needs to be tirelessly glad - handing voters and going to every event to fluff their film			1
if a movie 's main players are n't willing to commit to living and breathing and fighting for their film for the two months leading up to the @entity13 , they can forget about taking home a statue			0
bills can run into the millions to fly the talent back and forth across the country and keep them upright and happy during the final stretch			0
then there are screening costs and advertising costs			2
full - page ads in trade magazines like @entity209 and the @entity210 can cost $ 25,000 each , with ad budgets ranging from $ 15,000 to $ 1 million			1
political campaign tricks are obvious			2
not so for @entity13 campaigns			0
selecting the leader of the free world may hold far greater stakes than what to put on your @entity219 queue , but they both deserve a high level of transparency			2
audiences deserve to know what goes into an @entity13 win before they give it credence			0

@entity233 : campaign of prettier people with better hair rages on in @entity7
campaigning costs more than $ 100 million a year , but stakes are huge , she says
@entity233 : spin , trade ads , publicists , party planners , consultancies cost *fortunes*
stars do as much glad - handing and *promoting* , she says , as politicians in election season
