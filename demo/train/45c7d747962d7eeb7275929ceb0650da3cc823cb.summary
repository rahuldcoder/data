@entity0 , @entity1 -- manned by a pair of trained officers , a large private security jeep moves slowly past the high walls lining a residential street in the suburbs of @entity0 , @entity1			1
heavily armed and alert , the officers scan the designated area , looking for any suspicious activity			0
they work for @entity11 , a private security company hired by local residents to patrol their area and protect them from any potential criminals			1
" to be proactive , we need to be noticed , " says @entity15 , managing director of @entity11			0
" we need people to say ' hold on , there is a dedicated tactical vehicle			0
' " a tactical vehicle is a bigger vehicle -- it is more aggressive , it 's a deterrent			0
so the first point is we want to deter as opposed to catch crime			0
" the security officers are well armed			0
they carry semi-automatic weapons and hand guns and they 're trained in how and when to use them			0
and while only the police have the power of random stop and search in public places , security companies also stop people they regard as suspicious			0
from april 2011 to march 2012 there were 15,609 murders in @entity1 , as well as 64,514 sexual offenses and 101,203 cases of aggravated robbery			2
according to the country 's latest " victims of crime survey , " 57 % of respondents felt that housebreaking / burglary was the crime most feared in their area of residence			2
in recent years , @entity1 has stepped up efforts to tackle crime , one of the country 's worst social ills			1
last september , the @entity55 said that serious crime in the country had been reduced by 31.8 % from 2004/5 to 2011/12			0
but 2011 to 2012 saw a reduction in serious crime of just 1.9 %			0
" we only have the official crime statistics to go by , " says @entity60 of the @entity61 in @entity1			2
" if you look at what the police would report annually in september of every year , we see over the last three or four years that crime has leveled off			0
" the more concerning factor is the high percentage of so - called violent or contact crime , which is about a third of all the crime reported to the @entity55			2
" and that 's what has fueled the boom in the country 's private security industry , crime experts say			1
there are nearly 9,000 companies and 400,000 registered active private security guards			1
that 's more than the police and army combined , according to @entity1 officials			2
" the security industry is bigger than what it has ever been in @entity1 , " says @entity60			1
" i think the growth in the industry is definitely attributed to the fact that , let 's call it a weak policing or ineffective policing , and it created the opportunity for private individuals to move into the market			1
" some of those individuals have a military background			0
@entity98 , chief operating officer at @entity1 - owned @entity99 , spent 18 years in the special forces and military intelligence before joining the private security sector a decade ago			1
he is today one of the 17,000 people employed by @entity99			0
part of the multi-million dollar company 's work is dealing with small - scale crime , like recovering fuel stolen from a petrol station			2
the company , which also provides security at many of @entity1 's mines and has been kept busy by the recent strikes in the sector , offers a range of services , including 24 - hour property monitoring and protection against organized criminal syndicates			1
" the role of private security companies is distinctively different to that of the police , " says @entity121 , the chief executive of @entity99			1
" we view our role as private security to really aid and support the police			2
" but what happens when private security companies take matters into their own hands ? the @entity1 government claims that it 's an industry that threatens national security and is determined to tighten its regulation			1
" a very dangerous situation arises if you have a security industry that outstrips both your police and your army and there is completely no regulation of that industry , " says @entity138 , the head of the @entity139			0
" i think the public can find themselves in situations where , basically , they are put at the mercy of private security companies who are unprofessional , " she adds			1
one measure considered by the country 's government is that private security firms must be owned by @entity1			1
" this type of move is going to frighten away foreign direct investment and i think that is a danger , " says @entity159 , sales director at the @entity1 arm of @entity161 , a @entity162 - listed global security giant			2
" foreign direct investment is already down year on year but this is a worry from that perspective for me			0
" whatever regulations the @entity1 government eventually introduces , it seems unlikely the demand for private securities companies will diminish amid high unemployment rates , as well as widespread poverty and simmering industrial tensions .			1

@entity1 has 400,000 private security guards , and nearly 9,000 security firms
experts put the industry 's growth down to high crime rates and inefficient policing
some claim that the industry is a threat to national security
