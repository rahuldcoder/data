@entity0 -- @entity4 gov. @entity3 will seek an immediate stay of what he called an " unprecedented " federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year , he said thursday			1
a three - judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5 % of design capacity by december 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if @entity4 does not report on its progress every two weeks , thursday 's ruling said			1
@entity4 has the nation 's largest prison system and says it has been reducing overcrowding			2
the case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars			1
when plaintiffs filed motions to convene the three - judge court panel in november 2006 , @entity4 's prisons were at 202 % of design capacity			1
in 2011 , the @entity37 @entity36 upheld a three - judge federal panel 's determination that @entity4 's medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding			2
the @entity36 in 2011 found that @entity4 's shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in " needless suffering and death " and recognized the federal court 's prison reduction order was " of unprecedented sweep and extent , " thursday 's ruling said			1
the high court affirmed that order in full in 2011			0
on thursday , the three @entity37 @entity59 judges expressed impatience with @entity4 officials , the defendants in the case			0
" the history of this litigation is of defendants ' repeated failure to take the necessary steps to remedy the constitutional violations in its prison system , " the order said			0
" it is defendants ' unwillingness to comply with this court 's orders that requires us to order additional relief today			0
" the three - judge panel added that the plaintiffs ' request for a court order to show why @entity4 should n't be held in contempt " has considerable merit			1
" " our first priority , however , is to eliminate the deprivation of constitutional liberties in the @entity4 prison system , " the three judges said in their ruling			2
" we will therefore defer ruling on plaintiffs ' motion , and defer instituting any contempt proceedings related to defendants ' prior acts until after we are able to determine whether defendants will comply with this order			0
" court documents also show that " defer " was not only all capitalized but also printed in bold face .			0
