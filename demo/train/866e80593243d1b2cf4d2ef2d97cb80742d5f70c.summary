@entity0 -- the right punch @entity4 @entity3 threw to knock out @entity6 @entity5 in the sixth round of their non-title welterweight clash arguably registered on the @entity10 , with the aftershocks being felt from the posh @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 to the last - standing shanty in the typhoon - ravaged areas of @entity17 , the @entity6			1
when @entity5 hit the canvas with a resounding thud , @entity6 all over the world cringed and felt the impact of the debacle down to their toenails			1
in the @entity6 , where the fight was shown in cinemas , restaurants , and makeshift arenas , some stood in silence in utter disbelief while others unabashedly shed tears			2
the day following the fight , the front page of all the major newspapers in the country read like the obituary page			0
@entity5 's loss could not have come at a worse time			1
just days before the fight , @entity42 " @entity41 " ( international name @entity44 ) leveled several provinces in the @entity40 and @entity17			0
@entity45 @entity6 were all counting on @entity5 to lift their faltering spirit with another sterling performance in the ring , but the @entity5 also ended up taking it flush on the chin			1
that @entity6 are also treating @entity5 's loss as a " natural disaster " is not without a reason			1
@entity5 is more than a boxer in the eyes of his countrymen			1
from the time he burst into the world boxing stage by knocking out @entity4 @entity57 in november 2003 , @entity5 has been looked upon as a walking icon , a symbol of everything that is positive about the @entity6 : @entity61 - fearing , resilient and tough as nails			1
after every major win in the ring , @entity5 , who grew up in dirt poverty , made it a point to share his astronomical paycheck among the poor			2
down the road , he explored other avenues to help out : he successfully ran for a seat in @entity73 and started moonlighting as a game show host who indiscriminately gave out prizes to contestants			0
the devastating loss to @entity3 , however , sends the signal that @entity5 is already feeling the brunt of the responsibility he has been made to assume			2
before the fight , not a few noted that @entity5 's focus on boxing had waned			1
he insisted that he was in control of the situation , but the observations were confirmed following the horrific knockout loss to @entity3			0
to some extent , @entity5 has become a prisoner of the suffocating image he has created			1
turning 34 on december 17 , @entity5 's career as a boxer is at the crossroads			1
is it time to focus solely on boxing to give his career the glorious send - off it deserves ? is walking away from the sport with his health intact the best option available ? or should he again flirt with disaster by continuing to multi-task ? considering all that he has done for his countrymen , perhaps it is only proper for @entity5 to finally look out for himself			2
boxing is a dangerous sport and what happened in the @entity3 fight is proof that even a supposedly invincible boxing champion is susceptible to a flesh wound			0
then again , at a time when his countrymen are down on their knees and in dire need of a hero , it appears that @entity5 is bent on lacing on the gloves to carry the fight anew for his people			2
there is this scene in the movie @entity120 where @entity121 , aka @entity121 , tries to convince @entity122 to leave @entity123			0
" you do n't owe these people anymore			0
you 've given them everything , " @entity126 tells @entity122 , to which the @entity127 replies : " not everything			0
" you can say that the @entity6 ' own knight is treading the same dangerous curve			0
we can only hope that he will emerge from his quest in one piece as nobody wants a repeat of the @entity3 ordeal .			0
