-- once - missing @entity2 mental health records regarding a student who killed 32 people and himself in a campus rampage were released wednesday			1
@entity6 killed 32 students and faculty members on april 16 , 2007 , then killed himself			2
the records cover all the interactions between @entity6 , 23 , and @entity2 's @entity11 during november and december 2005 -- the only times the center saw @entity6 , the university said , and nearly two years before his april 16 , 2007 , shooting spree			1
they were found recently at the home of dr. @entity17 , the center 's former director			0
according to the university , @entity17 's attorney has said the records were inadvertently taken from the center when @entity17 left his job there more than a year before the shootings			0
the records detail a phone evaluation by the counseling center on november 30 , 2005 , and on december 12 , 2005			0
@entity6 was evaluated in person following his release from a mental health facility on december 14 , 2005			2
he was sent to the facility on a temporary detention order , the records indicate , after a female student filed a complaint with university police that @entity6 had been instant - messaging her and left a message on her dry erase board			2
the records from the facility , @entity40 , note that @entity6 told his suitemate he might as well kill himself because " everybody just hates me			1
" the records said @entity6 stayed overnight at the facility			2
" essentially , it does not appear that he had any serious intent when he made the suicidal statement , " the records said			0
" he was counseled about the need to act responsibly			0
" in each of the three evaluations at the @entity11 , @entity6 " explicitly denied any intent to hurt himself or others and there was no evidence to the contrary , " @entity2 said in its statement			1
" at the time of his last appointment , @entity6 was completing his fall 2005 semester exams and was scheduled to spend the holiday break with his family			2
he was provided with emergency contact information			0
" as we know , @entity6 never called or returned to the @entity11 , and more than a year elapsed between the time he was evaluated by counseling center professionals and the tragic events of april 2007			1
" the records also contain a december 14 , 2005 , e-mail to the center from a university housing official , documenting @entity6 's " history of erratic behavior and counseling - based issues at the time of his referral to @entity40			1
" @entity6 's suitemate had notified police because he had made suicidal statements and had " blades " in his room , said the e-mail			1
@entity83 gov. @entity82 said last month the files were discovered at @entity17 's home in connection with a civil lawsuit , but did not elaborate			2
the records ' absence was a mystery and a concern during the investigation , he said			0
the governor said his office was asking the @entity6 family for permission to make the records public			0
@entity6 's family agreed earlier wednesday to the records ' release			1
" the family has consistently favored and urged disclosure of their son 's and brother 's records in the interest of advancing the investigation into the tragic events of april 16 , 2007 , as well as ensuring that the families of the victims have as much information as possible , " said family attorney @entity103 in a letter to @entity105 , @entity83 assistant attorney general			0
" the unavailability of pertinent counseling center records during more than two years of investigation and review has created needless uncertainty and understandable speculation that has compounded the suffering of the survivors , families and the @entity2 community as a whole , " the university said in a statement			1
the records confirm facts already established by the panel that reviewed the incident , the university said			0
but " @entity2 remains deeply dismayed by the prolonged unavailability of the records and looks forward to the completion of the @entity138 investigation into their unauthorized removal from the @entity11			1
" @entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

files show *dialogue* between @entity6 and @entity2 's @entity11
report : @entity6 talked to suitemate about suicide because " everybody just hates me "
@entity151 says it was " deeply dismayed by the prolonged unavailability " of the files
