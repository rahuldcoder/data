-- having just quit a highly lucrative job with tech giant @entity2 in the @entity3 , where he 'd made millions working as a program manager , @entity6 would wake up once in a while wondering if he 'd done the right thing			1
" and then i read the words of @entity9 , " remembers @entity6 : " whatever you can do or dream you can , begin it			1
@entity12 has genius , power and magic in it -- begin it now			0
" what @entity6 wanted to begin was to create a university in his native @entity19 , a state - of - the - art education hub that would help educate the country 's next generation of leaders			1
inspired by the saying of the famous @entity26 writer , @entity6 moved with his family back to @entity19			1
there , he invested his own money and with the help of other donors he founded @entity32			1
" @entity35 needs to have a renaissance , " says @entity6 , as he explains what drove him to take the risky decision			1
" the world needs to change in this way and i strongly believe that people like me who have had the privilege of a great education need to be part of the solution ; that i need to be really actively involved in helping to drive this change in @entity35 so that 30 , 50 years from now , the world will be a different place for all people of @entity49 descent in the world			0
" fostering leaders located about an hour 's drive from the capital @entity54 , @entity55 , which appropriately translates to " beginning , " is the first @entity19 university to combine technical majors with a liberal arts approach			1
its vibrant campus , set on 100 acres in a town called @entity62 , was designed to be inspiring for the more than 500 young @entity19 studying there			2
read this : building a network of leaders and while @entity55 has already come a long way -- when the school first opened in 2002 there was no campus , just a couple of rented buildings for its 30 students -- @entity6 plans to expand his offering as part of his dream of finding and developing @entity35 's next problem solvers			1
" in this country , only 5 % of college - age kids go to college , " he says			2
" and there 's two problems with that number : one is it 's too small , but the second is that everyone who goes to college by definition is going to be running this country one day , the 5 % -- they 're going to be running the courts , they 're going to be designing roads and buildings and infrastructure , they 're going to be running the hospitals , the schools , the businesses			0
" so when i look at universities i see @entity35 fast - forward 30 years			0
when this 20 - year - old is now in his or her 50s , that person is going to be a leader			2
and so i felt that engaging how that leadership , that future leadership core , is educated could be catalytic			0
" tough decisions @entity6 , who grew up in @entity54 , left @entity19 in 1985 to pursue his own education in the @entity3			1
there , he got a job at @entity2 , spearheading software design for dial - up internet access , making millions in the process			1
he admits that quitting @entity2 was not an easy decision and credits his @entity3 wife for supporting him			1
" i wo n't lie to you -- it was tough , " says @entity6			2
" but i can tell you that when i mentioned this idea to my wife , she immediately agreed , " he adds			0
" she 'd never been to @entity35 before she met me and part of her conviction that this sounded like a good idea and her willingness to go ahead with it was very encouraging			0
" read this : @entity35 's outspoken educator committed to providing greater education opportunities in @entity19 , he went back to school himself , earning a master 's degree at @entity134 , one of the world 's top business schools			1
for his efforts , he 's won many awards			0
changing the continent today @entity141 , which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year , offers degrees in business , information systems and computer science , with plans to offer engineering and economics majors in the near future			1
its graduation rate is between 70 and 90 % , according to @entity6			2
total fees costs $ 9,000 a year , including tuition , housing and meals			0
@entity6 says the university brings together a diverse mix of students from different backgrounds , including scholarship - winning undergraduates from humble beginnings who are the first in their families to attend college			1
read this : young innovators can change how world sees @entity35 " our last freshman class , 50 % of that class paid full tuition , 25 % were on full scholarships and 25 % on partial scholarships , " he says			0
" the reason why diversity 's so important is that the most important conversation on campus is a conversation about the good society -- what is the good society we would like to see in @entity35 ? ' that conversation is a lot more interesting if you have diversity in the classroom , " adds @entity6			2
" because each person has an important perspective to share , but each person also has certain blinders that need to be peeled away -- that can be peeled away if they 're in a room with others who have other perspectives as they do			0
" looking ahead , @entity6 says he hopes @entity35 's universities will cultivate a new generation of bold and innovative leaders , helping the continent to transform itself			2
" if you come back in 30 years , universities will be competing for the best and brightest students , " he says			0
" i hope that universities will also be competing on things such as whose students are the most ethical , " he adds			0
" if that happens , it will change the continent			0
