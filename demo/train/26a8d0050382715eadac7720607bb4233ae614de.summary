-- when people complain about the nearly three - hour length of the first installment of " @entity6 " film trilogy because the source book is a slim 300 pages , they 're forgetting that much of the story is n't from " @entity6 " itself -- but expanded from the appendices to " @entity12			1
" that extra material is what justifies the longer time on screen , and answers such questions as where does @entity18 go when he disappears ? why is the wizard helping the dwarves on their quest in the first place ? what 's so bad about dragons ? and so , to put a stop to all those moments when you 'd otherwise wonder , " but that was n't in the book ! " here are the five major changes from " @entity6 " the book to " @entity6 " the films			1
the @entity36 ' quest in the book " @entity6 , " a company of dwarves led by @entity39 seek help from @entity41 because they need a " burglar			1
" that 's the term they use , because they seek to steal a whole mess of gold , treasure and other gems such as the @entity50 from the dragon @entity51			2
( or rather , steal it back , since @entity51 stole it from them in the first place )			0
in the film , the quest becomes a bit more noble , since the dwarves now phrase it as stealing back their homeland , @entity63 , the @entity63			2
even though this only existed in " @entity6 " as a story @entity39 told @entity41 to explain their quest , in " @entity6 : an @entity70 " film we get to see what a thriving dwarf town looks like and how they lost it , even if @entity51 himself is barely glimpsed yet -- a tail here , a wing there , an open eye that looks eerily like the @entity76			1
the @entity82 " he is an enemy far beyond the power of all the dwarves put together , if they could all be collected again , " @entity18 says in " @entity6			1
" but when @entity88 wrote the novel he had not yet conceived of @entity82 and the one ring which only came 17 years later in " @entity12 , " so the connection between the @entity82 and @entity82 was not made clear			1
now that we know they 're one and the same , the filmmakers are able to connect the dots for us , by bringing in glimpses of the @entity95 ( or the graves of the nine men who are the @entity95 ) and their @entity99 blades			0
and while @entity18 knew that the @entity82 was a great threat , knowing @entity82 is no longer sleeping is an even greater one			0
@entity102 @entity18 found @entity39 's father @entity104 in @entity102 , which was near the river where the ring was lost , as " a prisoner in the dungeons of the @entity82 , " he says in " @entity6			1
" when asked to explain , he says , " never you mind			0
" we get much more an explanation in the appendices , which will undoubtedly become a major scene in a later @entity6 film			1
as a ringbearer , he was hunted down by @entity82 's emissaries , who then tortured him and took the ring from him at @entity102			2
when @entity18 found him , he was near death , and could barely remember his own son 's name			2
despite his condition he asked the wizard to give him an inheritance anyway : a map and a key to @entity63			0
of course , when @entity102 is threatened , @entity82 need only move on -- to @entity127			0
the @entity128 we also will meet another foe , @entity131 ( played by @entity132 ) , an @entity130 who fights with @entity39 's family and during which @entity39 earns his nickname " @entity39 " for the makeshift tree branch he uses in battle against him			2
@entity131 is described in the appendices as " a great @entity130 with a huge iron - clad head , and yet agile and strong			0
" @entity131 , who killed @entity39 's grandfather @entity143 , is believed to be dead in " @entity6 , " but why kill off a great villain when you can have him hunting down the dwarves throughout the story ? his history gives the @entity149 more reason to chase down @entity39 and company than the other nameless @entity149 who would have been required otherwise			1
the @entity153 in the film , @entity18 leaves the dwarves ( and @entity41 ) from time to time on their quest -- but where does he go ? at least during one of these absences , he consults with a member of his order , @entity162 ( before he goes bad ) and two elves , @entity164 and @entity165			0
it 's never specified in the books who are the members of the @entity153 other than @entity162 ( who never actually appeared in " @entity6 " proper )			1
we do know from the appendices that the council is formed around the same time that @entity173 found @entity174 , only to be murdered by @entity175			0
coincidence ? with the council , @entity18 discusses what kind of a danger the @entity82 really is , why they should destroy @entity102 , and why that 's necessary for him to help the dwarves -- getting rid of the weapon of mass destruction that is @entity51 is their best interest , too , since the dragon would certainly aid the enemy			0
and why should n't they be allies , when both are played by @entity191 ?			0

there are some *differences* between " @entity6 " book and the new film
much of the film 's story is actually from the appendices to " @entity12 "
the first movie installment of " @entity6 " is almost three hours long
