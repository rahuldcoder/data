-- for anyone around 30 or older , this week 's royal engagement left one with an uneasy feeling of déjà vu			1
the photographs of prince @entity6 and @entity7 , facing the flashing cameras of the world 's press , were uncannily like those of @entity6 's parents , the @entity6 and lady @entity13 , when they announced their plans to marry in 1981			1
the color of the dress , the pose , the linked arms , the looks -- they were almost identical			0
@entity7 was even wearing @entity13 's ring			1
the rapturous response from the media was a rerun of 1981 , too -- the special supplements , the pages and pages of photographs , the speculation about who will design the dress , where they will honeymoon , where and how they first met , who their friends are and from whom their families are descended			0
television channels were saturated with more of the same , the only difference being that this time around we have nonstop rolling news broadcasts so there was even more on which viewers could feast			0
bad news took a back seat			0
the @entity47 people , struggling with job losses , cuts and economic hardship just as they were 30 years ago , were lifted out of the gloom for a day			2
when it comes , the wedding will be another great boost to the country 's morale , an excuse for a giant party , for people to take to the streets , embrace strangers and celebrate , just as it was in 1981			0
the nation fell in love with @entity13 , and the nation has once again fallen in love with the woman who wears her ring			1
so where does the comparison end ? the first wedding was dubbed a fairy tale , but the story did n't play out as it should have			2
looking back , it is all too easy to see why and to see why this marriage between @entity6 and @entity7 has every chance of being the real thing			1
@entity6 and @entity13 scarcely knew each other when they became engaged			1
he had played the field during his 20s			0
he had a string of pretty girls who adorned his arm , each one exciting speculation in the press , but by 32 , the pressure to find a suitable bride had become intense			0
once the press identified @entity13 as a possible candidate , they hounded her mercilessly until @entity6 was told by his father that he must make his mind up and either marry this girl or let her go			1
he asked her to marry him			0
she was from a broken home , albeit an aristocratic one			0
she was poorly educated and had little experience of the world			0
she was quite unprepared and emotionally ill equipped for life as a member of the royal family , a life that is as bizarre as it is unreal			0
when asked on the day of their engagement whether they were in love , the @entity6 famously replied , " whatever love is			1
" @entity6 and @entity7 met at university in @entity106 's and were friends before they were ever lovers			1
they have known each other for eight years and appear to have become soul mates			2
no one who has seen them together can question that their love is genuine			0
@entity7 is 10 years older than @entity13 was			1
she may be middle - class , but she comes from a stable , loving and happy family			2
she is well - educated and has traveled and seen the world			2
she has held down a responsible job , and crucially , they got to know each other away from the public gaze			0
the monarchy learned a lot during the @entity13 years and is infinitely better armed today to protect the privacy of its members			1
the press may not have been tamed but they have certainly been given boundaries that never existed in @entity13 's day			1
@entity7 is going into this marriage and this bizarre life with her eyes wide open			1
she has had a taste of what life in the gold - fish bowl is like			2
she 's been followed and photographed , analyzed and criticized , and her humble origins have been chewed over in the press			0
she has proved herself to be made of strong stuff and to be discreet , loyal and trustworthy			0
@entity13 became a superstar and at times she eclipsed @entity6 because she was young , glamorous and fun , and he was seen as rather staid and serious			1
it was n't good for their relationship			0
@entity6 is a superstar himself ; he is young , glamorous and fun			1
and he is @entity13 's son			2
@entity7 wo n't eclipse him ; she will complement him			1
his overriding desire is to be seen as relevant in his public life , and with someone who is so grounded and so normal by his side , i have a hunch they will become a formidable team			0
the failure of @entity6 and @entity13 's marriage almost destroyed the monarchy			1
this union has every chance of securing its future			0
