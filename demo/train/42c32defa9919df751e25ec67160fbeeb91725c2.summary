-- three years after 2 - year - old @entity4 was last seen alive , the murder trial of her mother is nearing an end			1
the @entity4 trial has lived up to the intense pre-trial hype and drama , beginning six weeks ago with her lawyer 's blockbuster opening arguments alleging that her father -- @entity14 , who was @entity4 's grandfather -- helped to cover - up that the girl accidentally died in the family pool			1
prosecutors have denied that claim , as has @entity14 himself on the stand			0
rather , they say that the @entity23 woman rendered @entity4 unconscious with chloroform , duct - taped her mouth and nose , and stored the child 's body in her car trunk for a few days before dumping it in the woods			2
a utility worker found the girl 's skeletal remains in december 2008 , six months after the last sighting , in a wooded area near her grandparent 's home			0
by then , her mother had already been charged with @entity4 's murder			1
both sides will soon get their final chances to present their disparate cases , with closing arguments expected sunday after a rare saturday off - day , according to court spokeswoman @entity44			1
then , the final decision will be in the hands of the jury of seven women and five men			0
they will decide if @entity4 , now 25 , is guilty on seven counts including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading police			1
according to @entity44 , the jury members -- who are all from @entity56 , after @entity58 superior court chief judge @entity57 moved the jury selection process there due to extensive media coverage around @entity23 -- will deliberate through the july 4 holiday , assuming a quick verdict is not reached			0
if @entity4 is convicted of murder , the prosecution has signalled that it plans seek the death penalty against her			1
she has pleaded not guilty to all charges , and denies harming her daughter			2
though she did n't take the stand during the trial , her lawyers worked to question the depth and validity of the prosecution 's case and raise doubts about @entity14			2
they say the father , who they claimed began sexually abusing @entity80 at age 8 , panicked upon finding the dead child and told his daughter her mother would never forgive her			0
the defense frequently called @entity4 's parents to the stand , making them a focal point			1
in @entity14 's case , they appeared largely intent on poking holes in the former police detective 's stories			0
her mother @entity4 went on the stand to , among other things , alleged that she looked on the family computer for items like chloroform and , inadvertently , for neck - breaking			2
forensic computer experts , called by the prosecution , worked to knock down these claims			0
on friday , after all the evidence had been presented , the defense again requested that the case against @entity4 be dismissed -- claiming that the prosecution had failed to adequately show how @entity4 died and at whose hands			1
and once again , @entity57 denied their request			0
prosecution witnesses , including @entity14 , have pointed to the smells emanating from the trunk of @entity4 's @entity114 that they claim came from a decaying human body -- @entity4 's body , they allege			2
the prosecution also sought to paint @entity4 as someone who habitually lied , whether it was about her working at @entity119 , that her daughter was with an imaginary nanny named @entity122 , or a number of other people and scenarios that she appeared to invent			1
friends , her former boyfriend and acquaintances testified that in june and july 2008 , @entity4 was staying with her boyfriend , spending time in @entity23 with friends , attending parties , going shopping and hitting nightclubs			0
they said she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time			0
in opening arguments , defense attorney @entity134 said that @entity4 was then doing " what she 's been doing all her life , or most of it : hiding her pain			1
" " this is a tragedy that snowballed out of control , " he said			0
" this is not a murder case			0
this is not a manslaughter case ... this is a tragic accident that happened to some very disturbed people			1

@entity4 is on trial for the murder of her daughter , among other charges
*testimony* concluded friday , and closing arguments are expected on sunday
the prosecution claims that she killed her daughter then lied to investigators
the defense calls it " a tragic accident that happened to some very disturbed people "
