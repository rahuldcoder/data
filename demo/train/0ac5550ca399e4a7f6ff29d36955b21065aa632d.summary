a safe distance from @entity3 's @entity2 , several @entity0 stare through a stand of trees at the site of one of the nation 's worst terrorist attacks			1
the opulent mall has proudly stood for six years -- like a glittering city within a city in the popular enclave of @entity14 , about 15 miles from slums where residents struggle daily to survive			1
but saturday 's attack by @entity19 terrorists has left dozens dead , turning the 350,000 square foot , five - story shopping complex into a symbol of a very different kind			1
related story : @entity0 mall shooting enters fourth day among the onlookers tuesday gathered at a cordoned off area near the scene of the attack , cab driver @entity26 said he does n't feel safe anymore			1
the tragedy has shaken him			2
it will take a long time to return to any sense of safety or normalcy			2
@entity2 has made its name as a place to see and be seen -- where shoppers sipped frozen yogurt , caught a movie and shopped for the latest fashions amid an extravagant waterfall and casino			1
for the nation 's wealthy , it was a taste of the @entity47 in their own backyard : 80 stores including @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- lined its pristine , peach colored marble hallways			1
for @entity0 's expatriate community , the mall was a taste of familiarity in a land far from home			1

coffee shops that were once filled with lively chatter have been littered with half - empty latte cups left by shoppers trying to escape with their lives			2
on the day of the attack , my cousin , @entity76 , and his two daughters , ages 6 and 3 , found themselves with about 40 other shoppers in the mall parking garage			1
they 'd just returned from a grocery store to pick up food for the family dog , @entity86 , when gunmen stormed in , @entity89 rifles blazing			1
@entity76 came face - to - face with one of the terrorists , a lanky , 6 - foot man , wearing a black scarf - like cloth on his head and magazines of ammunition around his waist			1
" just like @entity99 does in the movies , " @entity76 recalls			2
" we 're not here to rob you , we 're here to kill you , " the gunman announced to the crowd			2
" you 've been killing our women and children in @entity108			1
" when the gunmen demanded to know if they were @entity110 , @entity76 hesitated just long enough for the attackers to turn their attention to a man nearby			2
the man stared at them blankly when one attacker tested him by asking who the @entity117 's mother was			1
they shot at him -- the bullet ripping through his coat -- but leaving him unharmed			0
the interaction lasted long enough for @entity76 to push his two girls under a parked car , and for him to stoop low behind it			0
they waited , and waited			0
" girls , did you pray today ? " he whispered			0
" i 've prayed five times already , " the older daughter told him			0
" i do n't want to die today			0
by then , the gunshots did not sound as close			0
they felt confident enough to make a run for safety			0
" westgate bad , blood , " the younger daughter told me later			0
she showed me scratches on her face from laying flat on the ground			0
" i ran , ran , ran			0
" eventually , the @entity141 escaped unharmed			1
@entity0 and foreigners died in attacks scattered across the complex			1
it was the deadliest terror attack in @entity0 since @entity146 blew up the @entity148 embassy there in 1998 , killing 213 people			1
terrorism experts say the attack bears eerie similarities to the 2008 siege of a hotel in @entity155 , @entity156 -- another upscale target with @entity159 appeal			1
@entity160 , a @entity161 terrorist group that attacked the hotel for more than three days , killing 166 people			1

" this is a soft target			0
it 's in a high profile area , " said @entity170 military analyst retired lt. col. @entity171			1
" there 's going to be a lot of foreigners there , a lot of wealthy there			2
this is -- this was well - planned and well - thought out			0
" @entity170 national security analyst @entity181 said , " there is no sort of hard perimeter by which you could screen for security purposes , and so it 's difficult to protect			2
" the tragedy has changed many who 've been touched by it			0
four days after the attack , @entity76 is still trying to sort out his feelings			2
" you have to take time to let it sink in			0
i think i 'm still in shock , " he said			0
" all i keep thinking of was what if they were different scenarios			0
what if i had parked at a different place			0
what if i had not gone to that mall			2
at the time , all i kept thinking was i just could n't let these girls die			0
" outside the mall , the @entity0 keep watch			1
@entity26 , the taxi driver , shakes his head			0
" i wo n't be going back in there			0
never , ever , ever			0
