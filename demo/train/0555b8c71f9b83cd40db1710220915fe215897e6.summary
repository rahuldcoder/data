-- auctions are like sporting events ; pundits and punters predict the outcome but never really know what will happen			0
triumphs and record breakers tend to make art press headlines , while upsets are quickly swept under the nearest @entity12 rug			2
the performance this week of a @entity16 @entity15 bowl , bought for $ 3 at a yard sale and sold at auction in @entity19 for $ 2.2 million , is the latest result in a string of successes for " undiscovered " @entity16 porcelain at auction			1
it began in earnest in the 1970s and reached a climax on november 13 , 2010 , when a porcelain vase from the reign of 18th - century emperor @entity28 took a staggering 53 million pounds from a @entity16 bidder in a tiny suburban @entity33 salesroom , the kind where bidders sit on sofas and chairs that are part of the estate auction			1
both pieces sat unidentified , and unappreciated , for generations , rekindling the flame of hope that burns dimly inside all antiques enthusiasts , whether or not they care to admit it			0
flea - marketeers and yard - salers openly acknowledge they live in a world of false hope , spending countless hours , like fishermen who catch nothing but the smallest fry , or nothing at all in most outings			2
most hopes that live on are commonly dashed by the first encounter with a professional			2
the floor of an " @entity61 " taping set is littered with broken dreams -- and sometimes broken porcelain in emphasis			1
i do not believe anyone has ever statistically plotted the chances of turning up a valuable object at a yard sale opportunity , but expect such a number would be too small to register on any scale			1
before any attempt to uncover a dream , it pays to think strategically about what it is you are looking for			0
like finding the perfect partner , this may involve a process of elimination but depends largely on common sense and good powers of observation			0
the essential ingredient in determining value of an art object is no secret : supply and demand			1
i suggest those on the way to an early - morning yard sale repeat this over and over in the van			1
@entity96 may therefore be a positive factor , but if something is rare , or perhaps unique , and no one wants it ( your grandfather 's homemade table lamp perhaps ? ) , it has no value			0
on the other hand , an object may be plentiful , even mass - produced , but have even greater demand and therefore value			2
some years ago i sold a @entity110 perfume bottle at auction for a little more than $ 200,000			0
its owner had purchased the bottle at @entity115 in 1937 ( where it was marked down 50 % on sale ) for $ 25			1
there were plenty more waiting to be sold at the time			0
quality is sometimes but not always a factor in value			0
most baseball cards are extremely inexpensively made , and mass - produced , making all cards from any given series fundamentally the same , except of course for the subject			0
most cards , even those a century old , are worth a few dollars at best , and a pitiful percentage rise into the hundreds individually , but a few are valued into six or even seven figures			0
the economics of supply and demand work powerfully when applied to the subtleties of collecting a set			1
it is not coincidental that most remarkable numbers lately have been put up by @entity16 objects			1
the year 2010 , in which @entity16 overtook @entity140 to become the second - largest art market after the @entity142 , has been described as an annus mirabilis for @entity16 art collecting as wealthy @entity16 from all levels of the new society chose art and objects as tangible assets , suitable for investment , trading and bragging rights beyond simple display			1
the demand is as large as the @entity16 population and economy , and supply of exquisite objects limited , thanks to most being in @entity161 museums or private collections			1
a fundamental awareness of @entity16 porcelain may be a big help in your hopes of finding the same success as the owner of the @entity15 bowl , but serious knowledge is an area of immense expertise shared by an elite few and respected by the trade above all other areas of understanding			1
if you rely on luck , however , @entity16 porcelain is a fairly good bet			2
the @entity15 bowl looks quite ordinary to most of us			1
it is monochrome , with an extremely subtle pattern , and does not have a mark translating as " valuable @entity15 bowl " stamped on the bottom , making it look like a bowl found in @entity187 ( and more commonly found at yard sales )			1
good luck in your search			0
the only other comparable example is in the @entity192			0
perhaps a hidden treasure may be closer than you think			0
@entity194 offers an example of the insanely rare 1913 liberty head nickel in april			0
the last one we offered sold for $ 3.73 million			2
it looks pretty much like any other nickel to most of us , and there may have been others in circulation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity210 : @entity15 bowl that *fetched* $ 2.2 million is the latest in big deals on @entity16 art
yard sale fans ' hopes rekindled , he says , but dreams elusive ( see " @entity61 " )
he says key to value is supply and demand , but *calculation* *varies* so keep trying
@entity208 : @entity16 art value growing , especially in @entity16 , as society and art market open up
