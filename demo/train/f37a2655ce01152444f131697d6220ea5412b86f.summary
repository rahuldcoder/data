@entity2 @entity1 -- one half of the groundbreaking , smooth - sounding , record - setting duo , the @entity1 -- has died , a hospital spokeswoman said			1
@entity7 , a spokeswoman at @entity8 in @entity9 , confirmed @entity1 's death on friday , but could not provide additional details , citing the family 's request			1
during the late 1950s and early 1960s , @entity1 and his brother , @entity14 ( now 76 ) , ranked among the elite in the music world by virtue of their pitch - perfect harmonies and emotive lyrics			1
@entity21 labeled the @entity1 " the most important vocal duo in rock , " having influenced the @entity22 , the @entity23 , @entity24 and many other acts			1
along the way , they notched 35 top 100 songs -- more than any other vocal pair			0
the @entity1 ' sound -- with @entity14 's lower register generally complementing @entity35 's higher voice -- was the backbone of dozens of hits			1
the two began as songwriters before signing a deal in 1957 with @entity41			0
they became international sensations over the next five years with tunes such as " @entity44 , " " @entity45 , " " @entity46 " and " @entity47			1
" in terms of record sales , their chief rivals during this stretch were @entity53 and @entity54			0
their style -- a product of their blend of rock ' n ' roll with @entity61 folk , bluegrass and other genres more closely aligned to their @entity65 roots -- helped them earn inductions in both the @entity68 and the @entity69			2
" the amount of music that can be directly traced to the @entity1 is incredible , " wrote one admirer on @entity71			1
' " @entity35 and @entity14 were born in the business , the offspring of country and western singers @entity79 and @entity1			1
the @entity80 sang with their parents in live shows and on the radio			0
in the mid- ' 50s , while still teenagers , they moved to @entity85 to be songwriters			0
in 1957 , they found a @entity89 and @entity90 song , " @entity44			1
" according to " the @entity92 of @entity93 , " 30 acts had rejected the song , but the @entity94 -- with the key guitar contributions of @entity96 , who played on many of their hits -- took the song to no. 2 on the pop charts			2
" they added @entity106 riffs , teenage anxieties and sharkskin suits but -- for all that -- the core of their sound remained country brother harmony , " read their bio on the @entity69 's website			1
after averaging a @entity116 hit every four months over the next few years , the @entity1 inked a 10 - year pact with @entity118 ( formerly part of @entity121 's parent company , @entity120 , though now owned by @entity122 ) in 1960			2
more success followed -- including " @entity124 , " which the duo wrote -- and they stayed particularly popular in @entity127			1
" @entity44 " was " the first thing that really killed me , " @entity128 once recalled			2
he called @entity129 immediately upon hearing the song , according to a @entity128 biography , and the two set to work on their own act			0
the @entity80 also served to bond the nascent @entity22			0
upon hearing " @entity47 " in 1958 , the young group -- which had just added @entity135 to a lineup that included @entity137 and @entity138 -- could n't wait to cover it			2
" when we first heard it , it blew us away , " @entity138 said in @entity144 's new @entity22 biography , " @entity145			0
" by the 1970s , the pair was performing in a band that also included legends @entity148 and @entity150			0
but their time together came to a sudden end in 1973 , when @entity35 stormed off the stage during a show in @entity156			2
the brothers reunited on stage and in the studio 10 years later , leading to more albums , including " @entity161 " ( including the @entity138 - written " @entity162 " ) and " born yesterday			0
" their remaining years were highlights by occasional shows , hall of fame inductions and various other honors , including a @entity168 in 1997			0
