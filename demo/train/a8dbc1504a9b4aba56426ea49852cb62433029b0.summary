@entity0 , @entity1 -- the curious faces scrutinize the classroom kitchen , where pots and pans dangle from the ceiling and sharp knives glisten on the counter next to heaps of spinach and ripe green peppers			2
the one - night , hands - on course , called food 101 , is meant for them			1
they are the cooking inept , who ca n't properly to chop an onion , let alone saut√© a medley of vegetables			2
first - time student @entity22 , 33 , of @entity0 , is attending the course offered by @entity24 because she is dubious of her kitchen abilities			1
she only knows how to prepare grilled chicken and steamed broccoli ( and on some nights canned black beans and rice )			0
her boyfriend is sick of eating the same thing at home			2
she is sick of eating out			0
" i usually make whatever is easy , and i guess that 's not much , " says @entity34 , dressed in an apron with her fingers still wet from fumbling through the tomato dicing activity			2
" i 've avoided the kitchen for 33 years			2
" cooking dinner ? there 's an app for that from @entity48 celebrity chef @entity47 to first lady @entity49 , a food revolution is brewing in @entity50 , a push to return to the bygone days when healthy home - cooked meals were much more frequent			1
despite the efforts to get @entity50 back into the kitchen , there still exists a group of adults in their 20s and 30s -- like @entity34 -- who are clueless in the kitchen			1
ironically , these 20 - and 30 - somethings may have stretched their palates while traveling the world and even spend hours watching the cooking shows and " top chef , " but they are defeated when they enter the kitchen			1
they do n't own cooking utensils in their @entity70 - filled cabinets			1
they rely on microwaves , restaurants and takeout menus to feed their empty stomachs			2
simply put , they can not cook			2
" lots of people think , read and talk about food , but they do n't know how to do anything , " said @entity77 , head of the @entity79 program at @entity80			2
" there is an incredible disconnect to actually knowing how to do something			0
" i never learned to cook no one tracks precisely how many young noncookers exist , but it 's easy to find them			1
just ask anyone between the ages of 20 and 40 , and they will shrug and say either they ca n't cook -- or point to a friend who ca n't make anything			1
they come with plenty of excuses for their cooking incompetence : " my friends would rather eat out			2
... i do n't like cleaning the mess afterwards			0
... cooking for one person is impractical			2
... i 'm too busy with my job to cook			2
... i live in a city with plenty of affordable restaurant options			0
... my @entity111 kitchen is too small			2
" " i could n't tell if she wanted the big bubbles or little bubbles , " says @entity112 of @entity113 , @entity114 , reflecting back on a time in her early 20s when a friend asked her to boil some eggs			2
@entity120 never had to boil anything before her friend asked her			0
she admits her mother cooked meals for her growing up , but she does n't know why she never learned			0
" i just never had to do any of it , " she says			0
@entity120 , now 30 , has a 7 - year - old daughter , but she rarely prepares anything more complicated than opening a jar of spaghetti sauce and boxed pasta			1
one time , she tried to fry some chicken , but the attempt ended with a disastrous blister on her leg			0
most of the time , her mother cooks for her daughter			0
restaurants , processed foods take over at all ages , there are individuals who can not cook			1
but @entity80 food studies expert @entity77 theorizes the group of 20 - and 30 - somethings ca n't cook mainly because of a dependence on processed foods that took hold in the 1970s			1
@entity147 snacks , frozen dinners and instant soups flooded the marketplace , replacing traditional home cooking as mothers joined the workplace			1
during this period , the feminist movement grew stronger , @entity77 explained			0
a stigma formed around mothers who cooked meals from scratch			0
they were labeled domesticated women tied to the household , @entity77 said			0
home economics classes were out , working mothers were in			2
and so , @entity77 says a generation of children never learned from their mothers how to cook			0
another reason why some people can not cook , some food experts believe , is that the restaurant culture took hold of the @entity50 family			1
dual incomes made restaurants more affordable to the growing middle class			0
in particular , fast food chains such as @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 began invading almost every community in @entity50			1
nearly half of spending on food in the @entity50 family went to " food away from home " in 2008 , according to @entity186 's @entity185			1
in 1970 , about 30 percent of food dollars were spent away from home			1
" if you have a great food scene and so many affordable options , then you do n't need to necessarily be in your own kitchen , " said @entity190 , 26 , a food writer who created the @entity191			1
" cooking is no longer a survival tactic			0
" @entity190 26 , admits on her blog that she can not cook even though her job is to dine and review restaurants across @entity111			1
her inability to cook inspired her video series called " @entity203 " on her blog , where she helps young noncookers learn how to prepare a quick snack			0
in one of her fast - paced , three - minute online videos , she looks uncomfortable in the kitchen as she teaches her viewers how to make a @entity211 salad that only requires putting chopped tomatoes , cucumbers , olives and feta cheese in a large mixing bowl			1
she struggles to use the pepper grinder , and then casually tops the salad with balsamic vinegar and a few pinches of salt			0
@entity190 hopes the simple recipe can make cooking less daunting for young folks like herself			0
the great obesity war studies have shown that eating out usually consumes more calories than cooking at home , which has complicated the obesity epidemic			1
about 34 percent of adults in the @entity50 are considered obese , defined as having a @entity231 30 or higher , according to the @entity232			1
the obesity epidemic has motivated the food reform efforts by @entity47 and @entity49			1
" if you do n't know how to cook , then you have no options , " writes @entity47 to @entity2			1
" you 're forced into a series of bad choices and a diet of mostly processed foods ... cooking skills are life skills and just as important as knowing how to manage your money			1
" in the march edition of @entity245 , first lady @entity49 , who has embarked on the fight against child obesity , wrote about the lack of healthy home cooking			1
" back when many of us were growing up , we led lives that kept most of us at a pretty healthy weight , " she wrote			0
" we walked to school every day , ran around at recess and gym and for hours before dinner , and ate home - cooked meals that always seemed to have a vegetable on the plate			1
" a cooking comeback ? some food experts argue a revival of cooking has emerged among the young adults , both male and female , over the last decade			1
the @entity270 is loaded with young foodies , blogging and posting about their culinary adventures			0
the popular @entity274 will launch the @entity275 this month , a trendier sister channel that targets younger audiences			0
@entity190 writes on her blog that she 's trying to learn to cook for the sake of her health and wallet			1
several weeks ago she learned to bake tarragon chicken			0
it 's a recipe that took three times to get right			0
she mashed the spices into the butter and then coated the chicken breast all by herself			0
@entity288 , editor of @entity290 magazine , said she 's noticed subscriptions jumped among 20 - to 30 - year - olds over the past few years			1
" cooking is hip now , " she said			0
" it 's not just for someone with a @entity298 accent who is 70 years old and lives in @entity299			0
it 's become much more inclusive			0
" back in the @entity24 classroom kitchen in @entity0 , there is only one bloody finger by the end of the night from a dicing and chopping exercise			1
the steam from the freshly made vegetable stock is simmering in the pot. a steak is being seared on a pan in a homemade sauce			0
the students are eager to enjoy a home - cooked meal			2
@entity34 says she is inspired by the course			0
no more chicken and steamed broccoli			0
with some basic cooking skills , she 's going to throw her friends a dinner party , all from scratch .			2

ushered by @entity47 and others , there 's a push to get @entity50 back into the kitchen
a lot of 20 - and 30 - somethings have no idea how to cook
food experts : restaurants , processed foods took a toll on home cooking
food shows and food blogging have become popular in the past decade
