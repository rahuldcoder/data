-- dangling from the top of a 20 meter mast while bouncing along the open waves would test even the most hardened sailor 's stomach			2
if the vertigo does n't rattle you , the mast lurching at a 45 degree angle will			0
then there 's the real possibility the whole boat could capsize under the strain -- plunging you deep under water with it			0
but for maritime photographer @entity17 -- who pioneered the hazardous art of masthead photography and bagged some of sailing 's greatest images in the process -- it 's all part of the day - job			1
the extraordinary pictures , taken from masts up to 10 storeys - high , capture sailors the size of ants scuttling around on sleek white decks , surrounded by churning ocean and enormous rippling sails			1
looking back at a career that now spans over three decades , @entity17 recalls the reaction to her first foray into masthead photography in the early 1980s			1
" the pictures were incredible because no one had taken a photo from that angle before , " she said			0
" a lot of guys would n't do it , so there was admiration and respect for the fact i was trying something new			0
the media completely pounced on it			0
" an exhilarating oeuvre of images followed , and @entity17 has since been shortlisted for the prestigious @entity57 sports photography awards , @entity58 and exhibited at @entity60 's @entity59			1
with a new book , set to be published in january , chronicling in vivid detail the work that has made her a household name in sailing circles , it 's funny to think that it all began as little more than a dare			1
after graduating from the @entity69 with a degree in photography , @entity17 landed a dream job taking pictures aboard @entity57 yacht victory , during the 1982 @entity75			1
it was a joke by the crew that first prompted her to shimmy up the 24 meter mast			2
" they thought it would be quite funny to send me up the mast to get me out of their hair , as i 'd been photographing them day - in - day - out for a few weeks , " @entity17 writes in the upcoming book			1
little did they realize the young woman was well up to the challenge , having been raised in a sailing family and yachting since the age of three			2
" once at the top i started shooting , but my feet kept swinging into frame and i had to find ways of wrapping my legs around the mast so i could virtually hang upside down and not fall out of the bosun 's chair			0
" the result was a remarkable image of the vibrant white , blue and yellow sail billowing around the seemingly tiny deck , later used as the poster for @entity108 's @entity75 campaign			0
" @entity109 is known for her spectacular shots -- whether they be from the top of the mast of a racing yacht or at incredible angles within the water			1
she brings the colors to life and manages to capture yachts and yachting in the right moment , " said @entity117 , managing director at international superyacht charter company @entity118			2
" in an industry that was largely dominated by men she carved out a highly respected position and reputation , " she added			0
capturing such striking images comes with its dangers , as @entity17 discovered in the early 1990s when the yacht she was photographing capsized while she was at the top of its 18 meter mast			1
she had been presenting a television show when the skipper lost control of the yacht			0
" we were down in seconds , " said @entity17			1
" fortunately one of the crew had cut the rope [ attaching me to the mast ] so i was able to pull myself away			0
to this day i always carry a knife with me			0
" when not otherwise clambering up the world 's tallest sailing ships , the award - winning photographer can be found hanging from a helicopter in a harness traveling 160 kilometers per - hour in hot pursuit of @entity156 competitors			1
not content with aerial acrobatics , the ballsy @entity157 has also carved a name for herself as an accomplished underwater photographer , diving six meters below the surface to capture yachts silently slicing through the waves in the annual @entity164			1
it 's this volatile environment that keeps @entity17 coming back again and again			2
" i love the color and drama of sailing -- the human endurance in unpredictable conditions			2
" " i 've never seen myself as a daredevil , my drive has always been trying to find a different image , something that has n't been done before			0
" when asked if she believed she was indeed the pioneer of masthead photography , the answer is straightforward : " absolutely			2
" judging by her plethora of dizzying images , it would be a tall task finding another photographer who could claim that hard - earned title .			0
