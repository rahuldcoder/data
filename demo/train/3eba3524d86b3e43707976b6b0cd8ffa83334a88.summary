upon her return , she says she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and is now on a mental leave of absence from the school after a public breakdown in the spring			1
@entity0 , a fair - skinned , red - haired @entity16 studies major , titled her story " @entity6 : the story you never wanted to @entity21			1
" she posted her account on @entity23 under the username @entity24			0
her story has struck a chord around the world , racking up more than 800,000 page views as of wednesday morning			0
it quickly found its way to @entity6 , where many readers sympathized with the story and men felt compelled to apologize for the experience she endured			1
others called for greater perspective and warned against making generalizations about @entity6 or its people			1
reaction : @entity6 women feel sorrow , anger at @entity1 student 's harassment claims @entity6 's deadly gang rape of a 23 - year - old woman in @entity49 happened a few days after @entity0 left @entity6 in december , and she said that helped others understand what she and her classmates went through			1
the country has continued to see several high - profile cases of rape and sexual violence cases since then , and the government has introduced tougher laws and punishment for sexual crimes			0
keeping chivalry alive in @entity6 : men respond to rape crisis on her return , @entity0 struggled to find a way to talk about a cultural experience that was both beautiful and traumatizing , she said in her essay			1
she writes : " do i tell them about our first night in the city of @entity72 , when we danced in the @entity74 festival , and leave it at that ? or do i go on and tell them how the festival actually stopped when the @entity1 women started dancing , so that we looked around to see a circle of men filming our every move ? " do i tell them about bargaining at the bazaar for beautiful saris costing a few dollars a piece , and not mention the men who stood watching us , who would push by us , clawing at our breasts and groins ? " when people compliment me on my @entity6 sandals , do i talk about the man who stalked me for 45 minutes after i purchased them , until i yelled in his face in a busy crowd ? " " how it feels to be a woman in @entity6 " later , she writes : " for three months i lived this way , in a traveler 's heaven and a woman 's hell			1
i was stalked , groped , masturbated at ; and yet i had adventures beyond my imagination			0
i hoped that my nightmare would end at the tarmac , but that was just the beginning			0
" a university spokesman confirmed @entity113 is a student at the school and would not comment on her mental leave			2
he said the school is committed to students ' safety at home and abroad			0
@entity0 said she did n't say anything to the professors on the trip until things reached " a boiling point " -- what she called two rape attempts in 48 hours			2
should solo female travelers avoid @entity6 ? @entity129 , a @entity2 professor who was in @entity6 for the first three weeks of the session , told @entity23 that he was unaware of @entity113 ' situation			2
he noted , though , that the university tries to prepare students for what they might encounter while abroad			0
the @entity135 in @entity6 program was based in the city of @entity72 , but the students traveled to other areas during the semester			2
" both faculty and staff in @entity143 and our local @entity6 staff counsel students before and during the trip about precautions they need to take in a place like @entity6 , " @entity129 said in an e-mail			2
" ensuring student safety and well - being is the top priority of both the college and staff and faculty associated with the program			2
" the university provided this statement to @entity23 : " nothing is more important to us at the @entity2 than caring for the safety and well - being of our students , here in @entity143 and wherever they go around the world in the course of their studies			0
the @entity2 offers extensive support and advice to students before , during and after their trips abroad , and we are constantly assessing and updating that preparation in light of events and our students ' experiences			0
we also place extremely high value on the knowledge our students seek by traveling and studying other civilizations and cultures , and we are committed to ensuring they can do so in safety while enriching their intellectual lives			0
" from @entity6 : a different view her story sparked a wave of reaction online , with scores of @entity6 responding , many with sympathy to her plight and pointing out that @entity6 women also experience high levels of harassment and abuse			1
@entity197 , a media professional in @entity199 , was moved to post this comment on her story : " it thoroughly disgusts me to be known as an @entity6 male ... an apology is extremely meager for all the trauma you 've gone through			1
" he expressed hope that politicians would " wake up and implement stricter laws against crime and sexual harassment on women			1
" " every time my girlfriend goes out alone , i pray that she comes back home safely , " wrote a commenter using the name @entity215			0
" being an @entity6 male , i apologize			2
" others , however , observed that sexual harassment was by no means confined to @entity6 , and @entity6 commenter @entity222 warned against condemning his home country when so many others failed to protect the women living within their borders			1
" i accept what happened was definitely an embarrassment and a cause of trauma for her that might haunt her for the rest of her life			0
but this has happened in many other countries or places and therefore it may not be the right thing to single out @entity6			2
" ' she could have been me ' : @entity243 urged after @entity49 gang rape another woman who said she was on the same @entity2 sponsored trip to @entity6 , posted a response on @entity23 calling on people to resist stereotyping @entity6 men and recognize that sexual assault happens all over the world			1
the student , @entity252 , said she dealt with her own share of harassment on the trip , but " in my experiences in @entity6 , i have met a solid handful of warm and honest @entity6 men -- men who are also college students , men who also love the thrill of riding on a motorcycle in the busy streets , men who defended me at necessary times , and men who took the time to get to know me and my culture			1
and that should not at all be surprising			0
" @entity269 said she believed @entity0 " had every right to tell her story " and in no way wanted to lessen the significance of her experience			1
but @entity269 , who is black , cautioned that " when we do not make the distinction that only some men of a population commit a crime , we develop a stereotype for an entire population			0
and when we develop a negative stereotype for a population , what arises ? racism			0
" one thing is certain : @entity0 sparked a huge discussion with a story that she thought no one wanted to hear			1
she said she is thankful for her experiences in @entity6 , and wants to see more international exposure about what women travelers and residents endure			2
" truth is a gift , a burden , and a responsibility			0
and i mean to share it , " she writes			0
" this is the story you do n't want to hear when you ask me about @entity6			1
but this is the story you need			0
