-- the @entity1 , @entity2 , board of supervisors on tuesday banned most @entity4 with toys , as they 're now served			2
the ordinance , which requires @entity7 's and other fast - food servings with toys to meet new nutritional standards , now goes to mayor @entity11 , who indicated before his election last week to @entity2 lieutenant governor that he would veto the law			1
that veto would be meaningless because the board approved the ordinance 8 - 3 , a veto - proof margin			0
with eight votes , the board could override the veto			0
the new law , which @entity1 officials hope other cities will adopt in battling a child obesity epidemic , was a defeat for @entity7 's , which led the fight against the measure			1
" as previously stated , we are extremely disappointed with this decision			0
it 's not what our customers want , nor is it something they asked for , " said @entity7 's spokeswoman @entity33			1
@entity33 said public opinion is against such government intervention			0
" any fair and objective review of our menu and the actions we 've taken will demonstrate we 've added multiple options for parents to choose			0
this includes @entity47 ( bagged , sliced , pre-peeled apples ) , low - fat one percent milk , 100 percent apple juice and @entity51 made with white meat , " @entity33 said in a statement			0
" and , as we have stated all along , we are committed to doing even more			0
" the new law addresses how toys and other marketing freebies entice kids to buy fast - food meals that are high in fat and calories , said supervisor @entity61 he initiated the proposal because his fifth - grade daughter is in the 6 - to - 11 age group that has seen obesity rates quadruple over the past 30 years , the same time that the @entity53 has been on the market			1
" this is a simple and modest policy that holds fast food accountable , " @entity66 said			1
before tuesday 's vote , @entity70 cited a study released this week by @entity74 's @entity73 and @entity75 , which examined 12 popular restaurant chains and found only 12 out of more than 3,000 kids ' meal combinations met the nutritional guidelines for preschool - aged kids			2
the study said the fast food industry spent $ 4.2 billion on advertising in 2009 and found that 40 percent of preschool - aged children ask to go to @entity7 's on a weekly basis , and 15 percent ask on a daily basis			1
also , 84 percent of parents say they 've taken their children to eat fast food at least once in the past week			2
under the law , @entity7 's and other restaurants will have until december 2011 to improve their meals ' nutrition by adding fruits and vegetables -- if the chains want to keep offering toys , including those promoting the latest films			1
the food and beverages will have to contain fewer than 600 calories , and less than 35 percent of total calories will come from fat			2
the meal must contain half a cup of fruit and three - fourths cup of vegetables , and offer less than 640 milligrams of sodium and less than 0.5 milligrams of trans fat			0
breakfast will have the option of offering half cups of fruit or vegetables			0
city officials said they expect a legal challenge from @entity7 's , which declined to comment on possible legal action .			1

new : all fast food with toys must meet new nutrition criteria
if nutrition standards are met , @entity7 's and other chains can offer toys with meals
the measure is part of a " food *justice* " movement ; officials expect a legal challenge
