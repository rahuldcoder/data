@entity0 , in northwest @entity2 , once bore the weight of a ton of people			1
the extreme salinity of what used to be the largest lake in the @entity9 allowed people to swim and relax without sinking			1
over the last 20 years , however , the salt lake has almost completely dried up along with the area 's agriculture and economy			1
according to the @entity17 , the lake has shrunk by two - thirds since 1997 due to @entity2 's water crisis and detrimental agricultural policies			1
president @entity21 has pledged $ 5 billion to fix the problem over the next 10 years , but can this buoyant wetland rebound ? that 's the hope of @entity25 , a documentary photographer from @entity26 , @entity2			1
in 2013 , @entity25 took a trip to the lake with some friends			2
at the time , he had heard stories of the lake 's dissipation , but it was not until he witnessed it that he grasped the true devastation of the ecosystem			2
" after seeing it , i found it an environmental and social disaster , " he said			0
" it was a tragedy			0
" @entity25 said it was a calling for him to document the dying lake and its effect on the community -- a photography project he said he will never finish			1
abandoned ships and wooden planks are just some of the random remains that tell us water was once in abundance here			0
social media follow @ @entity54 on @entity55 to join the conversation about photography			0
the surrounding residential complexes and children 's playgrounds are now full of salt and dust and memories of a once - bustling neighborhood			2
bleak and austere , the atmosphere appears completely desolate			0
some people still live there , according to @entity25 , but most moved out to neighboring villages after their farms were depleted			0
" when you walk on dried crystal of salt , in the absolute silence , you hear just the sound of cracking salt crystal			0
you remember that the sound of water in this area had been people 's life , and it 's very disappointing that that silence of the lake has silenced the life , " @entity25 said			1
like the washed - up boat in @entity0 , @entity25 's passion to document the drought is strikingly clear			1
" i believe that it is my duty to show realities and facts , and the judge is up to audiences , " he said			0
