@entity0 , @entity1 -- are you looking for an easy way to reduce your monthly budget ? look no further than your cell phone bill			2
@entity7 says consider switching to a less known cell provider to save money and avoid signing contracts if you 're with one of the four big providers -- @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 or @entity16 -- you 're almost certainly overpaying for service			1
in addition , all four have a business model that 's based on cowardice			0
they 've developed lousy , stinking , rotten two - year contracts because they 're afraid to compete in the marketplace			0
thankfully , there are a variety of smaller players in the market who offer nationwide coverage for less money with no contracts			1
before considering any adjustment to your cell phone plan , you 'll need to start by assessing how much you talk , text and surf the web on your phone			2
watch @entity7 discuss the pros and cons of bundling services if you use less than 300 minutes per month , you 'd probably do much better with a prepaid plan where you buy minutes as you need them			1
@entity41 is one service i usually recommend -- no roaming charges , no long distance charges , no monthly fees and a flat 10 cents per minute for calls			0
if you use more than 300 minutes per month and you travel from time to time , you might want to consider either @entity48 or @entity49			1
both have plans ranging from $ 25 to $ 50 and offer unlimited calling			1
the difference in price points is based on how many other features you want -- texting , web surfing and so on			0
but there are never any contracts or overages			0
for heavy cell phone users , there are @entity62 and @entity63			2
both are engaged in an all - out price war that can directly benefit you			0
@entity63 is offering $ 49.99 per month unlimited calling -- no roaming charges and no contract			1
if you want texting , you 'll pay an additional $ 10 per month for unlimited service			1
if you want high - speed internet , you 'll pay another $ 10 per month on top of that for a @entity76 plan			2
boost @entity78 's $ 50 per month plan already includes unlimited calling , texting and web access			2
and that $ 50 even includes junk fees ! one caveat here : remember , my definition of " cheap " means that i 'm willing to accept lower quality for a lower price			0
so consider this caveat carefully and do your own research before making any final decisions about your cell provider			1
speaking of cheap , a new competitor in the marketplace may have both boost and @entity63 beat			0
straight talk offers a cellular plan for $ 30 per month			1
you get 1,000 minutes , 1,000 text messages and @entity98 of data for that price			0
it 's important to remember that very few people use more than 1,000 minutes per month			2
the typical person clocks in at 790 minutes and pays an average monthly contract bill of $ 67 , according to @entity106 studies of @entity108 adults on individual cell phone contract plans			1
so , what are you waiting for ? consider firing your " @entity112 " cell provider and going with one of the smaller guys			1
the savings are there for the taking			0
finally , @entity118 can help you get out of your existing contract by trading it away to someone else			0
this tends to work particularly well if you have a hot phone that everybody wants .			0

smaller players in cellular market can offer nationwide coverage for less
@entity106 says typical *customer* uses 790 minutes , pays average $ 67 a month
@entity7 says do your research before making decisions about your cell provider
