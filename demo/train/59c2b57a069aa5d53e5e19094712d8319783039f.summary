-- the next time an @entity3 official petitions the @entity5 government to release @entity6 from prison , we should tell our friend and longtime ally in an unequivocal tone : he will die in an @entity5 prison , so stop asking ! now , i know that 's not how our @entity14 practices diplomacy , but there is no reason for the @entity5 to be diplomatic with @entity3 when it comes to @entity6 , a former @entity19 intelligence officer who stole secrets from this country and passed them on to @entity3			1
since he was convicted of espionage in 1987 and sentenced to life in prison , thousands of @entity3 have made it their mission to get him released and sent to @entity3			1
why ? so he could be treated like a hero ? let 's be clear : @entity6 is no hero			2
other than an @entity5 killing a president , he committed the most heinous crime someone from this country could do			2
you do n't go against your own country by passing on secrets to another nation , even if it 's an ally like @entity3			1
this week , @entity3 president @entity40 , who was in @entity41 to receive the @entity5 @entity42 , brought with him a petition signed by 70,000 @entity3 calling for the release of @entity6			1
he told @entity45 that @entity3 " feel very strongly about ( @entity6			1
) and i understand their sentiment			0
but i am doing it not as a diplomat ... but as a human being			0
" yet @entity3 leaders have used their official position to seek @entity6 's release			1
in 1998 , @entity54 , in his first go - round as prime minister of @entity3 , demanded @entity6 's release as part of his attendance at the @entity58 , an effort to broker peace in the @entity61			1
various reports from @entity3 who have talked with @entity54 said president @entity64 either considered releasing him or actually agreed to do so , but later reneged			0
in 2002 , @entity54 even visited @entity6 in prison			0
@entity6 is a deviant man who sold his country out for money , and no sort of pressure from @entity3 or any other country should cause a single @entity5 official to relent			1
when asked this week about the request of @entity40 , @entity73 press secretary @entity72 said : " our position has not changed , and will not change today			0
mr. @entity6 was convicted of extremely serious crimes			2
" it would behoove president @entity79 to go even further			0
he should say that as long as he is president of the @entity5 , @entity6 will never be a free man			2
while we are at it , we should also tell @entity83			0
@entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity86 , @entity88 - @entity87 , to pipe down			0
those two are asking @entity73 members to sign a letter saying @entity6 has served in prison long enough , and because his health is reportedly failing , should be released			0
really ? so is this how they feel about a member of our military who sold this nation out ? @entity5 should make no apologies			0
@entity6 deserves to rot in prison			0
when he joined the @entity19 , he took the same oath every member of the military must : " i , @entity6 , do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that i will support and defend the @entity107 of the @entity5 against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ; and that i will obey the orders of the president of the @entity5 and the orders of the officers appointed over me , according to regulations and the @entity115			2
" the next time an @entity3 official presses for @entity6 's release , we should give them a copy of this and say , " enough said			1
" in 2011 : @entity3 's @entity123 pleads for @entity79 to release spy the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .			1

@entity127 : @entity6 should remain *jailed*
@entity6 was convicted of espionage for giving @entity5 secrets to @entity3
@entity127 says @entity3 should stop efforts to win @entity6 's freedom
