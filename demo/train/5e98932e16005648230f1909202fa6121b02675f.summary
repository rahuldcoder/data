@entity0 , @entity1 -- the number one song on @entity6 's @entity5 charts this week is a romantic little ditty called " @entity8 and @entity9 "			1
in it , @entity10 refers to the object of his affection as " my bitch " while @entity15 boasts that his girl is cool because she performs oral sex while wearing shades			0
again , this is the most popular song on black radio right now			1
so now i ask you : how do we begin to criticize what president @entity24 has or has not done for the black community when lyrics like these are acceptable ? how can we dismiss @entity28 as a sell - out for calling black people " brainwashed " when the hottest song on the radio encourages men to treat women like receptacles ? how do we wave an angry finger at what governor @entity38 's rock may or may not have said 20 years ago while something like " @entity8 and @entity9 " is happening right in front of our faces , in real time ? @entity38 's " @entity44 " revelation is disturbing but if the controversy forces him out of the race tomorrow , life for black @entity48 would not be changed			1
our unemployment rate would still be twice the national average , we 'll still be disproportionately living in poverty , we 'll still be lagging behind in education			2
so despite the kind of 24 - hour sexiness that usually accompanies an n - word scandal like this one , the truth is that it is not the real story			0
the real story is if the black community does n't find a way to heal ourselves from these self - inflicted wounds , there wo n't be much of a black community left for people like @entity38 to offend			1
just this summer there was a report published in the @entity69 that concluded black men have a 50 percent chance to live longer in prison than out of it			2
@entity75 cuts in k - 12 education are expected to total over $ 4 billion this year and last , with low - income and minority students being impacted the most			2
this fall there was a book released that flatly asks " @entity82 ? " the black community is in a crisis ; being hit hard from a variety of cultural and socio - economic angles and we 're talking about rocks			1
each time a @entity38 or any other white person in the media finds themselves engulfed in an " n - word " controversy , instead of resting in our offense , the black community needs to view it as an opportunity to do some much needed soul searching about that word , and the disempowering mentality attached to it			1
talk about it in church			0
we have to move away from the bulk of our attention trying to determine if a white person is racist or not because news cycles move fast and we really need to stay focused on the real story			0
trust me : next week somebody would have slept with someone they were n't supposed to and we 'll forget all about @entity38 's rock			1
but as a community , we 'll still be hurting ourselves			2
sure we can point to the @entity118 story as evidence that racism does in fact exist within the upper echelon of the @entity123 and that @entity28 -- who has always openly criticized this notion -- is a jackass			0
but then what ? how does that move us forward ? it does n't			0
besides during the time in which the rock reportedly had the n - word painted on it , @entity38 was a @entity132 , not a @entity123 -- so was he a racist friend or is he now an inclusive foe ? and how do we reconcile the rock with the bill he signed that helps children of undocumented immigrants pay for college ? you know , there once was another governor of @entity143 , @entity142 , who , in criticizing her opponent -- @entity145 -- said his problem was that he was born on third base but he thought he hit a triple			1
i would say the black community 's problem is that we 're standing at the plate but so many of us behave as if we still ca n't get in the game			1
we 're waiting for our number to be called while pitch after pitch after pitch goes by			0
yes , systematic racism and the vortex of poverty have contributed mightily to what ails us today			0
but do we really need @entity24 to draw up a federal program that tells men to stick around and raise their kids ? would a president @entity38 or dare i say president @entity28 somehow impede our ability to pull up our pants ? treat our women with respect ? it seems we never have a problem rejecting the hurtful things said about or done to us by others , but remain somewhat oblivious to how the hurtful things we say and do to each other contributes to our overall decay			1
the news about the @entity178 ' hunting ground serves as a reminder that we 're hardly in a post-racial society			0
but " @entity8 and @entity9 " is the number one song in urban @entity48 right now			0
i do n't see how the n - word painted on a rock 20 years ago hurts us worse than that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			2
