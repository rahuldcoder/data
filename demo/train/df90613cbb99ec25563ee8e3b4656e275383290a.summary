-- @entity1 and @entity2 do not amuse @entity3 whose president @entity4 is apparently livid over the october release of " @entity6 , " a comedy starring @entity1 and @entity2 as tv people trying to score an interview with @entity4 , but are recruited by the @entity10 to take the president out			1
seriously , folks : is this comedy really supposed to be an " act of war , " as a spokesman for the @entity3 foreign ministry contends in a letter to the @entity18 ? does it constitute grounds for what the statement warns will be " a decisive and merciless countermeasure " against the @entity24 ? would it surprise you to know that these vitriolic reactions against a movie come from people who have n't seen the whole movie , but come by their assertions from watching the trailer ... and only the trailer ? of course it would n't			1
even in the @entity24 , there are humorless citizens who want to ban books based on nothing more than jacket blurbs			1
but this saber - rattling is well , kind of extreme			2
can anything be done to pull us from the brink ? maybe ... just maybe ... there 's somebody who can save the day , someone who can do the world a solid			1
one man ... one unlikely man ... let 's make that a very unlikely man			2
... and let 's now imagine ( only imagine ) the following exchange in the president 's home entertainment center , where the leader of @entity3 has just finished screening the trailer for " @entity6 " for this unlikely hero , this very good friend of @entity4 's ( @entity58 ) : @entity59 @entity18 : well ? @entity60 ( rubbing his eyes from beneath his dark glasses ) : well , what , man ? @entity59 @entity18 : what do you think ? should i declare war over this ? @entity60 : hey , man , i dunno ... i mean , if it was me , i 'd stay in @entity72 with @entity73 , but if @entity74 wants to go ... @entity59 @entity18 : what ? no ... no ! i 'm not talking about @entity74 ! @entity60 : good			1
cause i 'm sick of hearing about him			2
so what you wan na go to war over ? @entity59 @entity18 : this ! this ... movie which insults me , tells people i speak dolphin and do n't urinate ... @entity60 : oh , snap ! ( giggling ) yeah , i remember that line			1
now , where did i hear that anyway ? @entity59 @entity18 : ( barely containing himself ) : just now ! i showed you this trailer for " @entity6 , " it 's ... @entity60 : you mean that was n't the whole movie ? damn			1
pretty funny , anyway ...			2
@entity59 @entity18 : funny ? you think it 's funny these decadent @entity24 want to kill me ? @entity60 : ( peering around the room ) what 's funny is i do n't see any guns pointed at you , brother ... you see my drink anywhere ? @entity59 @entity18 : ( indignant , raging ) this movie threatens my life			1
and if it threatens my life , it threatens the people of @entity3 ... @entity60 : @entity107 , man , turn down the volume			1
i 've seen these cats in movies before			0
the people they play are too messed up to do anything straight			0
and if there 's anything i know about , it 's about being messed up			2
@entity59 @entity18 : @entity117 , not yours ! ! i 'll ... @entity60 : what you need to do , @entity4 , is take this mess over for yourself			1
you got to make the bad publicity work for you			0
they 've been saying all kinds of mess about me for years and i let it roll off me			0
i even let them think i 'm in on the joke by doing ads and comedy sketches and stuff against me			2
hell , it it 'd been me , i 'd have asked for points as soon as they bought the script			0
@entity59 @entity18 : ( bewildered , still seething ) i do n't understand you ... @entity60 : that 's it exactly , bro			1
and i make it work for me			0
i do n't even know what i 'm doing half the time			0
and do n't care either			0
@entity59 @entity18 : @entity142 ... how do i do this ? " @entity146 " this thing like you say ...			0
you could do your own trailer and make it about your own self or , maybe ... threaten reprisals or something like that ...			0
. just did that ...			0
@entity60 : well , there it is , @entity157 you just delivered a whole buncha tickets to those dudes			1
they got ta give you points now			0
@entity59 @entity18 : points ... like in basketball ...			0
@entity60 : do n't ask me			1
you sure you did n't take my drink away ?			0
