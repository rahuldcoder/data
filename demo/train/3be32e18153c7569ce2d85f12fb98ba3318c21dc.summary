-- on saturday , a company called @entity2 was scheduled to launch the first private mission to the @entity4 , demonstrating a freight - carrying capability @entity6 gave up when it retired its fleet of space shuttles in july			1
( the flight was aborted at the last second after a faulty valve was discovered ; @entity2 officials said the launch was postponed till tuesday or wednesday			1
) some @entity6 supporters are mourning what they see as the decline of @entity18 leadership in space			1
but they should really be celebrating the dawn of a new era			0
after all , we 've been stuck in low @entity23 for several decades now , at considerable cost			0
visionary plans for genuine space exploration have gathered dust at @entity6 , the @entity28 and other space - savvy places			1
they advocate relearning how to land on the moon or figuring out how to travel to @entity33 , an asteroid or the special orbital location where the @entity36 will eventually operate			0
but after more than two decades of talking that talk , the @entity18 has yet to walk that walk			1
turning over routine space trucking to private industry has important benefits			2
it frees @entity6 to innovate and to develop a new heavy - lift capability commensurate with real space exploration			1
at the same time , it empowers private industry to play a significant role in the nation 's space future			2
liftoff of the @entity51 rocket , its @entity50 filled with food , supplies and science experiments , had been scheduled for 4:55 a.m. et from the @entity2 launch site at @entity56 in @entity57			1
when it launches , three days later , astronauts will use a robotic arm to attach the @entity50 to the station			2
@entity62 will be unloaded , return cargo loaded in , and the capsule will return to splash down in the @entity65			0
light years : @entity50 to launch saturday it will be the third launch of the @entity51 rocket ; the second launch of the @entity50 , the first with components needed for space station docking ; and one of 12 planned @entity2 flights to the @entity4			1
@entity2 admits the riskiness of its endeavor			2
the current flight has already been delayed several times because of problems with the flight software			0
space - flight veterans in the company are well aware of the trial - and - error nature of technology development , but they also know risk is an essential part of innovation			2
@entity6 's @entity88 program is funding a handful of private companies -- including @entity2 ( @entity2 ) ; @entity91 , which built the @entity93 rocket launch system 20 years ago ; @entity94 ; @entity95 ; and @entity96 -- to carry cargo to the @entity4			1
@entity98 ( @entity98 ) plans to use its @entity100 rocket to launch humans into orbit by 2015			0
@entity0 explains : commercial space flight many of these private companies have goals far beyond servicing the space station			1
taking over space trucking from @entity6 allows them to pay the bills as they develop increasingly capable space vehicle systems			1
then , providing they can reduce space launch costs by a large factor , they may be able to exploit new business opportunities , including passenger traffic to outer space			1
still , they are not motivated by purely commercial concerns			0
the financial backers of these companies -- @entity122 of @entity2 or @entity94 's ( and @entity124 's ) @entity123 -- have invested hundreds of millions of dollars of their own fortunes			1
they doubtless would like their space adventures to turn a profit , but at heart they are modern - day pioneers who want to do something profoundly important for the future of humankind			1
take the example of @entity136 , a company that recently announced plans to investigate and eventually mine rare metals from asteroids			0
the news stories emphasized @entity136 's business plan , but their goals are far broader			0
they will first build small space telescopes to observe asteroids , so they can understand these building blocks from which @entity146 formed			0
asteroids larger than about 100 meters ( 328 feet ) in diameter are a potential hazard for the @entity146 , and understanding their composition will allow better prediction of their impact on the planet			0
should we ever need to deflect an asteroid , we 'll need to travel to it			0
so , while @entity136 might have a plan to make money down the road , they will first contribute critical knowledge to humankind , perhaps helping save the planet from destruction			0
furthermore , with an asteroid visit and perhaps even a sample return , @entity136 will discover whether materials essential for human sustenance ( hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , water ) can be recovered from these deep space objects			0
if so , they could set up interplanetary supply depots to enable human colonization of space			0
so there is a lot more to space commerce than mining asteroids for rare metals			0
private space companies describe a vision that sounds like the original @entity6 : big goals , with small but steady steps toward those goals , and much support but little interference from the nation			1
people who have visited @entity2 say its employees are among the best and brightest and that they mean to change the world			2
this is just what @entity6 did in the 1960s when humans moved out of low @entity146 orbit and ventured to the moon			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 : @entity2 to launch first private freight - carrying mission to the space station
she says some *lament* decline of @entity18 space leadership , but in a sense it frees @entity6
she says @entity6 can focus on space exploration ; companies are in it for business
@entity201 : companies also are doing pioneering work that will be helpful to humankind
