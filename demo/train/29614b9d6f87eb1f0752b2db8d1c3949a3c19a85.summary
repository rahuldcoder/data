however , the 22 - year - old spent almost half of thursday night 's game in @entity9 on the bench , only managing 12 minutes of action in the second half as @entity24 's @entity23 rivals leveled the finals at 2 - 2			1
" obviously we miss @entity1 when he 's not out there , " the @entity3 ' @entity26 center @entity25 told his team 's official web site			2
" he 's been so effective blocking shots and rebounding			0
those two things alone are a big plus for us			0
" trailing two points going into the last quarter , the @entity9 came from behind to win the game to prevent the defending champions from pulling ahead in the series			1
@entity36 was @entity9 's top scorer , finishing with 19 points			2
but veteran @entity9 players @entity38 and @entity41 were instrumental in their team sealing the win			1
coming off the bench @entity38 scored nine of his 18 points in the final quarter and @entity41 all of his 12			1
" i just felt like a beast			0
i just felt like i could n't be denied , " @entity38 told the official @entity6 web site			2
" it was all will and determination			0
this is where you grab the moment			0
all you can do is play in the moment			0
" @entity3 coach @entity57 believes that his team were outplayed by the @entity59 , especially in the closing stages of the game			1
" they really stepped on it in the fourth quarter , " said @entity57			2
" we seemed to not be able to stop the momentum of their game			0
and @entity57 has hinted at a change of tactics in the next game in order to make the most of guard @entity74 , who scored 33 points but was not effective in the fourth quarter			1
" he was tired , " @entity57 said			0
