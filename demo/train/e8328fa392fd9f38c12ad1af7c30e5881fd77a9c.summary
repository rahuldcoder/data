-- @entity2 's brother , @entity1 , needed a lot of special care			1
he was born with a rare chromosomal abnormality , which meant even as a teenager , he needed help doing things that most people take for granted			0
getting dressed could be a challenge			0
but @entity1 was also a happy child , who loved water , hugs and the music duo @entity16 , his sister said			1
he smiled and laughed about everything			0
" honestly , my biggest worry about him was that he was going to outlive the people that were able to take care of him , " said @entity18			0
" that was my biggest fear			0
" @entity26 , 15 , died on january 4			1
a medical examiner 's report lists his cause of death as acute pneumonia			1
the manner of death was ruled natural			1
despite the report , @entity18 , 28 , says she has questions , and she 's not alone			1
@entity37 has started an online petition , calling for the governor to investigate schools and the @entity41 over her brother 's death , which she says was caused by negligence			1
more than 250,000 people have signed it			0
@entity1 passed away less than a month after @entity18 says she called @entity48 to report their father , who took care of @entity1 and the boy 's younger brother in @entity53			1
@entity18 lives in @entity54 , @entity55			0
in keeping with its policy following the death of a child when there is an open or pending referral , @entity48 initiated an investigation			1
the department is working alongside the @entity64 , the @entity65 , the @entity66 and @entity67			1
the goal is to find out exactly what happened , said @entity71 , director of communications and community relations at @entity48			1
who knew what and when ? and what , if anything , could have been done to prevent @entity1 's death ? " i think the biggest thing we would like to emphasize right now is just how heartbreaking this whole situation is and that we 're working very , very diligently to try to find justice for this boy , " @entity78 said			1
' would n't live to see a year ' when his son was born , @entity84 says that doctors thought he would n't live to be a year old			0
unlike his daughter , he recalled the various health problems his son suffered			0
@entity26 , 47 , said @entity1 had so many ear infections that antibiotics rarely worked			1
he had been hospitalized at least nine times with pneumonia , and each time took its toll , he said			2
a single working dad , @entity26 needed help to care for his disabled son			1
he said he went to @entity48 three times , starting in 2010 , to ask for it			1
" they bounced me to another department , and they said well , somebody will come out			0
and nobody ever came out , " @entity26 said			1
" i finally said , forget it , i 'll do it on my own			0
" " i 'm not real big on every time i have a problem , go to somebody else to fix it , " he said			0
@entity78 , with @entity48 , declined to comment on whether @entity26 had ever approached the department and if so , what happened			1
that sort of information , if it exists , would be included in a report @entity48 plans to issue at the end of its investigation			1
without help at home , the responsibilities of feeding and changing @entity1 fell to his other son when @entity26 was at work			1
the brothers were only a year apart and best friends			0
they were together when @entity1 died			1
their father left work early that day because he felt under the weather			0
already sick , @entity1 's brother was home from school			1
" i was going to take both of them to the doctor that afternoon , " @entity26 said			1
@entity1 stopped breathing before he got the chance			1
his father started cpr and told his other son to call 911			0
@entity1 was transported to @entity67 , where he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival			1
" as a parent , no matter how your kid dies , you feel guilt , " said @entity26			1
" would he have been alive if i 'd taken him to the doctor the day before ? probably , maybe not , i do n't know			0
people die of pneumonia in the hospital			2
" he said he thinks about things he could have done differently			0
he wishes he 'd spent every second with @entity1 that he could			1
but sometimes , life gives you a bad hand , and there 's nothing you can do			2
" there are some people that when they 're hurting , they have to put blame somewhere			0
personally , i was raised a @entity159 , and personally i put the blame on @entity161 , " said @entity26			2
he lashed out at his daughter and others who say he was n't a good father			0
" if i did n't care properly for @entity1 , he would n't have lived 15 years , especially when we were told that he would n't live to see a year			1
" ' the system , it does n't work ' @entity18 says she 100 % believes that her brother would be alive if her father had taken better care of @entity1			2
but , in her mind , others are responsible for his death as well			2
parents might fail , but that 's why there are agencies in place to pick up the slack			2
specifically , she said she told teachers and administrators at the boys ' schools -- @entity188 and @entity189 -- to be on the lookout for signs of potential abuse or neglect			0
she thinks they failed to notice @entity1 lost a substantial amount of weight			2
" they 're called mandatory reporters for a reason			0
if you even suspect something is going on , you 're supposed to report it , " said @entity18			2
@entity203 , director of community relations and records management at @entity206 , which includes both of the boys ' schools , declined to comment on the case , citing privacy laws			0
she said no one from the @entity26 family has contacted the @entity213			2
besides the schools , @entity37 blames @entity48 and the police			2
she says she called to report her father to @entity48 on december 17			1
a worker went to interview @entity1 and his brother at their schools almost immediately , she said			2
the worker promised to make a home visit the next day , but never showed up , and stopped returning her calls , according to @entity18 , who says she also reached out to police			0
the @entity64 received a report from an anonymous caller on december 17 , requesting that officers check on @entity1 and his brother , said sgt. @entity228			1
officers checked the home , but there was no answer at the door			0
not ' just a cautionary tale ' far away and frustrated , @entity18 considered at one point just going to @entity53 and taking the boys			0
" of course if i could trade a pair of handcuffs , and sitting in a jail cell serving time for kidnapping , for my brother being alive , i would do it in a heartbeat			0
but at the same time , i know that with the resources and the information that i had at my disposal , i did everything that i could			0
" i relied on the system to work , and that 's just the problem			2
the system , it does n't work			0
it 's very much broken , " she said			2
@entity37 started a petition at @entity258 , which has so far collected more than 250,000 signatures			0
in it , she calls for the governor of @entity53 to investigate dhs and the schools			0
she hopes it will help ensure that what happened to @entity1 wo n't happen to another child			2
" this is n't just a cautionary tale			0
we could actually change things and prevent this from happening on a larger scale , " she said			0
@entity272 , a spokesman for @entity274 gov. @entity273 , told @entity0 that her office was aware of the petition and monitoring its progress			0
the governor 's staff has requested more information from @entity48			1
in the meantime , @entity1 's sister says she 'll continue speaking out about her brother , and on behalf of other children			1
" that 's the only way that i can make sense of it			2
maybe if what happened to @entity1 can save somebody else 's life , then there 'll be a little bit of justice in this world , " she said			1
@entity0 's @entity296 contributed to this report .			2
