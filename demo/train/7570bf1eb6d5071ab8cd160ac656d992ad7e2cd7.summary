editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a bestselling author whose forthcoming book is " @entity5 : a @entity6			1
" @entity2 says @entity7 demonstrate an extraordinary devotion to duty			1
( @entity3 ) -- there is a beach in @entity12 , @entity13 , just across the bridge from @entity15			1
it offers a beautiful view of the @entity18 , which is why it attracts tourists who are drawn to the sun. i thought about that beach yesterday , when the news from the @entity24 near the @entity25 was flashed around the world -- the news that the captain of the cargo ship @entity30 had been rescued from @entity32 pirates by @entity34 forces operating off the @entity35			1
that beach in @entity13 seems quite placid , even sedate			1
the historic , red - gabled @entity12 sits upon it -- the place where the @entity43 - @entity42 - @entity41 movie " @entity44 " was filmed			1
the feeling of the place is one of genteel manners , of delicate tradition			1
you almost expect to see guests carrying parasols and making reservations to play croquet			1
but down the beach there is another kind of tradition			2
that 's what i was thinking about on sunday			2
when i have stayed on @entity12 , i walk down that beach toward the @entity62			2
i remember a makeshift fence separating the beach from the far reaches of the base			2
but it was easy to walk around , and no one appeared to take it especially seriously			2
i have n't been back since september 11 , 2001 ; i would be very surprised if the barriers are n't more formidable now			2
on that part of the beach , on the outskirts of @entity72 , i saw @entity7 in training			1
here , the @entity76 winnows the men who would be seals from the ones who fall short			1
it was a humbling thing to witness			2
as the @entity76 itself puts it , seal training is like few other competitions : " @entity77 go through what is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training in the world			1
... the most important trait that distinguishes @entity7 from all other military forces is that seals are @entity92 , as they strike from and return to the sea			1
@entity7 ( @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 ) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate			1
their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces can not approach undetected			2
" they looked so young , those prospective seals on @entity12 beach			1
the maximum age to apply to be a seal is 28			2
they all know what they 're getting into when they sign up , but to see their faces -- including the faces of the ones who were falling behind , who probably were n't going to make the cut , who were gasping for air on the arduous runs along the beach and having trouble during the maneuvers in the ocean -- was to see a devotion to the concept of duty on a level few of the rest of us will ever know			1
maybe you , during the recent days when capt. @entity134 was held captive on that lifeboat off the coast of @entity137 , were asking yourself who in the world could come to his rescue			1
who had the training , and the courage , to carry out such a mission			1
we probably do n't ask ourselves that kind of question often enough			2
usually , military operations are talked about in the abstract , as if they 're lines on a chalkboard , or brightly glowing diagrams on a computer screen			1
but once in a while , like now , we stop to focus on what we ask of the people who serve in our stead when the task seems all but impossible			0
@entity159 would sometimes quote a line that summed up our wonder at those who make the choice to serve our country in this way : " where do we find such men ? " we find them among us , although we usually do n't know it when we see it			0
on @entity12 , on @entity171 , there was a bar called @entity173 's , owned by an ex-seal named @entity175			0
whenever i would stop in there , groups of guys from the naval base would be having a cheeseburger , maybe listening to a local acoustic band play a guitars - only version of @entity185 ' " @entity186			0
" you 'd sit among them , and it was easy to forget what brought them to this strip of sand			0
it was n't for vacation , or relaxation			0
where do we find such men ? sometimes at the next table over , listening to the music			0
from the @entity7 ' creed : " my loyalty to country and team is beyond reproach			1
i humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow @entity34 , always ready to defend those who are unable to defend themselves			0
i do not advertise the nature of my work , nor seek recognition for my actions			0
i voluntarily accept the inherent hazards of my profession , placing the welfare and security of others before my own			0
i serve with honor on and off the battlefield			0
the ability to control my emotions and my actions , regardless of circumstance , sets me apart from other men			0
... in the absence of orders i will take charge , lead my teammates and accomplish the mission			0
... i will never quit			0
i persevere and thrive on adversity			0
my nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies			0
if knocked down , i will get back up , every time			0
i will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission			0
i am never out of the fight			0
" where do we find such men ? over the weekend , we learned the answer anew			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1
