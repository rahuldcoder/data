to mark the end of @entity2 's holiest month , @entity0 will head not to a mosque but to a convention center guarded by law enforcement officers			1
that 's because this month , during @entity10 , the mosque in @entity8 , @entity9 , burned to the ground			1
its rubble smoldered for two days as a shocked @entity15 community came to terms with what had happened			0
" i think there are a few people who do n't like anybody , " @entity0 said			0
" they do n't like a different color than their color or different religions			0
" @entity0 , who is the president of the @entity8 mosque , said the congregation rented a convention center so people would have a place to pray and celebrate @entity30 , the feast that marks the end of fasting for @entity10			1
my take : how evangelicals could grow to love @entity15 authorities are still investigating the mosque burning but suspect the fire was intentional			1
in july , a surveillance camera caught a man throwing an incendiary device onto the building that damaged part of the roof			0
ahead of @entity30 , @entity0 said he contacted the police and sheriff 's department			1
they are sending extra officers sunday			2
it 's that way across @entity48 , after a spate of violence at @entity52 centers in recent weeks that included a homemade bomb and pigs parts			1
at least seven mosques and one cemetery were attacked in @entity48 during @entity10 , according to groups that track such incidents			1
" this is unprecedented in its scale and scope , " said @entity59 , spokesman for the civil rights and advocacy group , @entity60			1
he said @entity15 have not been under attack like this since the backlash after the september 11 attacks and the immediate aftermath of the @entity72 bombing when it was assumed the work of @entity52 extremists			1
just thursday , @entity76 , the head of the council in @entity78 , received a call from a young man visiting his father 's grave at @entity83			0
someone had desecrated several @entity15 graves			0
the @entity87 's name was taken in vain and , a black marker scrawling on a tombstone screamed : " raghead , " a derogatory term for @entity15 that stems from head coverings like turbans and kaffiyas			0
a few days earlier , police arrested 51 - year - old @entity96 and accused him of firing a pellet gun at a mosque filled with 500 people in @entity100 , southern @entity78 suburb			2
no one was injured but worshipers said one of the bullets flew only inches above a security guard 's head , according to @entity109 affiliate station @entity108			2
@entity96 is a neighbor and had previously spoken out against the expansion of the mosque			2
he was charged with four felonies			0
in a third @entity78 - area incident , worshipers at an @entity52 school in @entity115 heard a loud noise outside of the building during night prayers			1
they then found a 2 - liter soda bottle filled with acid			0
police identified it as a homemade bomb			0
no was injured in that incident , either , but on the heels of the carnage at the @entity129 temple in suburban @entity130 , and the burning of the @entity8 mosque , @entity15 in the @entity48 were fearful			1
the temple shooter died and his motives may never be known			2
but he was linked to white supremacist groups and @entity59 said many people felt the @entity129 were mistaken for @entity15 because of their turbans and beards			1
in @entity143 , @entity142 , a new mosque opened this month after more than two years of community protests , legal hurdles and vandalism			1
the board of directors planned for extra security			2
@entity142 mosque opens after 2 years of controversy when worshipers bow their heads in prayer sunday , someone else will be scanning the room			1
" yes , we are very concerned because we have been the subject of vandalism , arson , bomb threats , intimidation , bullying , " said @entity156 , a board member of the @entity157			0
" you call it , " he said			0
" every single act of intimidation , you know , was actually inflicted upon us			0
" @entity59 , the spokesman for the @entity171 , said @entity15 in the @entity48 have been asked to exercise caution			1
the council released a tip sheet on security : know your emergency responders , post observers , report threats , install surveillance cameras			2
@entity59 said @entity182 rhetoric has been building for years , especially from groups formed specifically to fight against @entity2 in the @entity48			1
" anti-muslim hate groups are a relatively new phenomenon in the @entity48 , most of them appearing in the aftermath of the @entity190 terrorist attacks on sept. 11 , 2001 , " according to the @entity191 , which tracks such groups			1
" earlier anti-muslim groups tended to be religious in orientation and disputed @entity2 's status as a respectable religion , " the center said			0
@entity59 , for one , believes there 's an " islamophobia machine working out there			0
" " eventually and inevetiably , it 's going to have an impact on the tiny minority of people willing to carry out acts of violence , " he said			0
rehab of @entity60 's @entity78 office also blamed the spike in incidents on government officials who he said were involved in fear - mongering			2
he cited statements made by @entity216 congressman @entity215 of @entity217 who warned @entity48 that " there is a radical strain of @entity2 in this country " and that radicals are " trying to kill @entity48 every week			1
" @entity222 , @entity223 's chief of staff , said the lawmaker 's comments were taken out of context and that @entity223 is troubled by attacks on any people based on their religion			2
nevertheless , the @entity230 blamed @entity223 for the homemade bomb incident			0
" it is not a coincidence that after the remarks by rep. @entity223 were made that there was a homemade bomb directed at an @entity52 school ... " the committee said			1
" the facts are clear -- by proclaiming to the public that ' @entity15 are trying to kill @entity48 every week , ' @entity223 raised suspicion of the @entity241 and incited fear			1
" there were other troubling incidents this month : -- in @entity246 , @entity247 , police arrested two teens and charged them with committing a hate crime after worshipers said the boys threw lemons at worshipers during prayer			2
-- in @entity256 , @entity247 , pig legs were left on the property of an @entity258			0
police still do not have information on who was responsible for the act , which was particularly offensive during @entity10 to practicing @entity15 who consider pigs as unclean			1
-- in @entity267 , @entity264 , a surveillance camera outside the @entity2 mosque showed a suspect breaking the building 's sign and two vehicles later fleeing the property			2
-- in @entity72 , vandals defaced the @entity274 with paintball guns			0
those inside the mosque feared the shots came from a real gun			0
in @entity8 , the torched mosque 's 90 congregants invited 300 other people to join them sunday for @entity30			1
" i still feel secure , " said @entity0 , the mosque president , though he knows a pall has been cast by all the attacks			1
he said the attacks on his community are instigated by a few ignorant people			0
he came to these shores from @entity288 23 years ago and still believes in the principles of this nation			0
" this is un-american , " he said of the mosque fire			0
" i 'm not afraid of any neighbors			0
i feel more secure here in @entity48 than anywhere else in the world			2
" he said all @entity15 have a right to practice their faith without fear			0
on this @entity30 , that may not happen in some houses of worship in @entity48 iftar in the @entity304 : @entity15 gather for breaking of @entity10 fast			1

attacks on @entity52 centers spiked across @entity48 during the holy month of @entity10
many muslims are fearful as they celebrate @entity30 in the @entity48
the fear was heightened by the carnage at the @entity129 temple and the burning of a @entity9 mosque
an @entity52 advocacy group has asked mosques to beef up security sunday for @entity30
