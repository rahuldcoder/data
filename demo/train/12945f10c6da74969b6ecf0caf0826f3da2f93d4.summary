days after @entity3 's @entity2 disintegrated above @entity4 , killing one of its co-pilots , @entity1 founder @entity0 says making commercial space travel a reality is worth the risks involved			1
the accident killed co-pilot @entity11 and injured co-pilot @entity12 , who managed to parachute to the ground			1
@entity0 paid tribute to @entity15 in an interview with @entity18 's @entity17 on monday			0
" he was an extremely brave man -- as all test pilots are , extremely brave people			1
he had a young family , he was married and his family loved him enormously , " @entity0 said			2
" but he was a test pilot , and test pilots are trying to discover things that 400 engineers and technicians on the ground ca n't necessarily see on the ground			1
and the test pilots push the aircraft to the limit before , finally , members of the traveling public are allowed on it			2
" asked if , in light of friday 's accident , he stood by his comment to @entity17 on the space program last year that " unless you risk something , the world stands still , " @entity0 told her that he did			2
" yes , the risk is worth it , " he said			0
" @entity46 would have been the first to say that			0
i 'm sure his parents and his wife and his sisters would not say that , but test pilots would say that , because the risk they 're taking , they know the importance of what they 're doing , " he said			2
" we 've got to go through the difficult testing stage of creating a space line in order to make it safe for travelers who want to travel on that space line in the years ahead , and we will persevere and we will succeed			0
" what caused the crash ? @entity2 disintegrated just two minutes after separating from the jet - powered aircraft that carried it aloft friday			1
at the time , the space plane was about 45,000 feet above the ground and about 20 miles northeast of @entity69 , @entity4			0
a team of 13 to 15 investigators from the @entity72 will be in the @entity73 for about a week			1
but analyzing the data from the test aircraft will take much longer , and the investigation may take up to a year			2
opinion : the truth about launching spaceships @entity0 warned against speculating before the board releases its findings			0
" the @entity83 press have , i think rather irresponsibly , speculated that it might 've been rockets exploding , it might have been fuel tanks exploding , in fact there might have been an explosion			0
" the @entity72 have firmly ruled all that out and have made it clear that they 're coming down to one particular thing that they think might have happened			1
but if you do n't mind , i 'm going to leave it to the @entity72 to let you know exactly what it is they think happened , and then we 'll wait for their definitive decision , " he told @entity17			1
friday 's flight was the first to use a new plastic - based fuel , something that @entity18 aviation analyst @entity107 has said could have affected the plane 's stability , despite the fuel tanks being found intact			0
@entity107 said that @entity3 had " consistently underestimated the risk involved			1
" @entity0 denied this , saying that 400 " of the best engineers in the world " were working on the project and that the risks were similar to those taken by people flying across the @entity118 in the 1920s and ' 30s			0
' feathering ' on sunday , the @entity72 revealed two clues about what went wrong , both involving the spacecraft 's " feathering , " a process used to stabilize and slow the spacecraft down toward @entity129			1
during feathering , two pieces on the back of the vehicle -- the " feathers " -- lift up perpendicular to the spaceship , making the vehicle look like it 's arching its back as it descends			0
but on friday , " the feather lock - unlock lever was moved by the co-pilot from the locked position to the unlocked position " prematurely , the @entity72 said			1
on top of that , the feathers are n't supposed to move until a separate feathering handle is activated			0
no one adjusted that handle ; yet the feathers were still deployed , @entity72 acting chairman @entity146 said			2
but @entity146 stressed that it was unclear whether pilot error , mechanical problems or another possibility caused the spacecraft to break apart in the air			2
" we are still a long way from finding a cause , " @entity146 said			0
" we are months and months away			0
" despite a debris field spanning 5 miles , investigators have found almost all the parts of the spacecraft needed for the investigation , @entity146 said			0
@entity163 may take up to a year veteran pilot killed a memorial fund has been set up for @entity11 's family			1
he worked at @entity167 , the company that partnered with @entity1 on the test flight program , and logged more than 1,600 hours as a test pilot and test engineer in @entity167 aircraft			1
analysis : will space accidents deter pioneer tourists ? @entity167 said sunday that co-pilot @entity12 -- the company 's director of flight operations -- was alert and speaking with family and doctors			1
" we remain focused on supporting the families of the two pilots and all of our employees , as well as the agencies investigating the accident , " @entity167 said			0
@entity72 investigators have yet to interview @entity12			2
" we have not because doctors did not recommend we do an interview at this stage , " @entity146 said			0
@entity2 helmed by experienced pilots when flight failed future of the program for years , @entity3 had planned to sell trips in which @entity2 would transport passengers about 62 miles above @entity129 -- the beginning of outer space -- and let them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to the ground			1
@entity3 planned to send paying customers on @entity2 as early as next year and has sold more than 700 tickets , each costing more than $ 250,000 , for future flights			1
deadly day for space tourism -- but future ' rests ' on such days , official says several celebrities have already signed up , including @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209			0
friday 's tragedy was not the first fatal accident to hit the @entity3 space program			1
in 2007 , three employees of @entity167 were killed during testing in the @entity73			0
sources told @entity18 that they had been testing components of a new rocket motor for @entity2 .			2

@entity3 founder lauds test pilot killed as an " extremely brave man "
the other pilot , who was injured , is alert and talking with his family and doctors , company says
a lever on the @entity2 was moved earlier than it should have been
but the @entity72 says the cause of the accident is still unclear
