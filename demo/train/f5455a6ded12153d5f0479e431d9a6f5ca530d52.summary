just four days before his inauguration , @entity2 president - elect @entity10 will meet with @entity5 president @entity12 on tuesday			1
and he says he wants to reshuffle the list of priorities the @entity5 and @entity2 share			1
" it is a mistake to limit our bilateral relationship to drugs and security concerns , " the president - elect wrote in an editorial published by the @entity18 on friday			1
" our mutual interests are too vast and complex to be restricted in this short - sighted way			0
" a crackdown on cartels was a hallmark of outgoing president @entity30 's six - year tenure , and the @entity5 voiced its support , offering $ 1.6 billion to aid in the fight			2
@entity10 has said he plans to focus more on reducing violence , but he 's offered few specifics about that approach			0
the 45 - year - old former governor , who won @entity2 's presidential vote in july , has said a top priority is to deepen economic ties with the @entity5			1
" perhaps the most important issue is finding new ways to bolster our economic and trade relationship to attain common prosperity in our nations , " @entity10 wrote last week , noting the potential for more trade , manufacturing deals and energy investment			1
the @entity5 is @entity2 's largest trading partner			1
the two countries share billions of dollars in imports and exports and a border that stretches nearly 2,000 miles			0
for the first time in more than a decade , economic issues are likely to dominate the agenda shared by @entity2 and the @entity5 , the @entity6 - based @entity54 said in a policy brief this week			2
that 's because drug - related violence appears to have plateaued and illegal immigration in the @entity5 from @entity2 has dropped dramatically , according to @entity62 , director of the center 's @entity63			1
@entity65 most - wanted fugitive captured in @entity2 " what 's driven the @entity5 - @entity2 agenda for the past 10 years has been the influx of undocumented immigrants and the headlines about increasing violence , and now both of those have leveled off			2
... it allows the two governments to begin to talk about other issues that matter for their long - term well - being , " @entity62 said			0
in @entity2 , analysts said on @entity0 en @entity79 's " @entity78 " that tuesday 's meeting could signal a new approach to the relationship between the two countries			2
" @entity10 should convince @entity12 that @entity2 deserves more attention			2
... this is the moment to change the style and propose a higher agenda , " said @entity85 , a professor at @entity2 's @entity86 and a former diplomat			2
political analyst @entity91 said @entity10 's government should push to have a greater influence on affairs within the @entity5 , convincing @entity5 officials that @entity2 are " important and relevant			1
" " the image of the country is very negative			0
there is a perception that we are corrupt and drug associates			0
this is a result of accumulated neglect , " he said			0
@entity10 " is inheriting a neglected relationship			0
" @entity2 beauty queen killed in shootout some critics have said @entity12 neglected @entity109 during his first term , and lambasted the @entity5 president for not bringing up @entity2 or other countries in the region during last month 's foreign policy debate with @entity116 challenger @entity115			1
at a forum hosted by the @entity120 - language @entity119 network in september , @entity12 said the @entity5 is committed to continuing to work alongside @entity2 to fight organized crime			1
" what i will be saying to the new president of @entity2 when he takes office is that we want to continue this cooperation and we recognize this is a threat on both sides of the border			1
we obviously generate a lot of demand for drugs on this side of the border , and cash and guns flow south just as drugs flow north , " @entity12 said			0
" if we can reduce demand , that means less cash flowing into these drug cartels			0
the other thing we need to do is work much more aggressively in preventing the flow of guns and cash down to @entity2			0
" both the @entity148 and @entity10 's transition team have said security will be a key topic during tuesday 's meeting , and @entity5 officials should continue to push for justice and human rights reforms south of the border , the @entity147 said in a statement monday			2
" while @entity10 has expressed his desire to shift the focus of the bilateral relationship away from the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime in order to place more emphasis on economic issues such as investment , trade , and energy , a dramatic shift in the focus of the @entity5 - @entity2 relationship seems unlikely , " the statement said			1
immigration also is likely to come up tuesday , since the topic is important to residents on both sides of the border , said the @entity63 's @entity62			0
topics such as education partnerships between the two countries and global issues could also be on the table , he said			0
