-- despite a thrilling victory at the @entity3 @entity2 that saw @entity4 close the gap on world championship leader @entity6 , @entity7 insist they are in no rush to offer him a new contract			1
the @entity12 chalked up his second victory of the season at @entity16 , hunting down the @entity17 of @entity6 at the climax of a hugely tactical race			1
@entity4 closed the gap between himself and his @entity22 rival to 16 points with the halfway point in the campaign fast approaching			1
though the 35 - year - old is emerging as a leading contender to claim his maiden @entity29 title and despite speculation linking him with a switch to @entity17 , @entity7 insist they are relaxed about his contract			1
@entity4 pips @entity6 to take @entity3 gp at @entity16 " i think that very simply we have a great relationship with @entity4 , " team boss @entity35 told gathered reporters			1
" as always with him , things are pretty straightforward			0
" this is his seventh season with the team			0
he has had all of his success in @entity29 with this team and we would like to see that continue			0
" inevitably there is an awful lot of speculation surrounding @entity17 , but we are only focused on ourselves			2
we can not control what other people say or do , and i think that @entity4 feels comfortable in the team			2
" the marque also boast defending double world champion @entity52 amongst their ranks , and @entity4 has been outspoken in the past about having to play second fiddle to the @entity56			2
but @entity35 confirmed that contract talks with @entity4 are on the agenda in the not too distant future and praised @entity52 for claiming a podium place at @entity16			1
" @entity4 wants to be in the team next year and therefore , as we have always stated , during the summer we will sit down and talk about the future , " he said			1
" and that period of time is obviously coming up pretty close now , so over the next few weeks we will be talking about 2013			0
@entity4 has given me every indication that he is very happy here , and you can see that in his driving			2
" he is driving very well this year , he has won two big races now -- the @entity70 and the @entity3 @entity2 , and i think his drive at @entity16 was excellent			1
latest @entity29 standings " it was great for him to win for the team at our local race , and obviously coming from just up the road as well , and to have @entity52 up there on the podium after a difficult first lap again was a double bonus			0
" meanwhile , @entity17 team boss @entity81 thinks the constructors ' title will be as closely fought as the drivers ' championship this year			1
@entity7 have dominated in each of the last two years and though they are out in front again this season , the gap to @entity17 is only 64 points			1
@entity81 said : " if we look at the situation of @entity16 , with the first four cars , it means we have made a step in the right direction from the performance point of view			2
but it is a very open championship , " he said			0
" i do n't believe honestly that the others will stay behind			0
i am sure @entity98 will fight to come back , and the others are very close			0
" i was impressed by the pace of @entity101			0
if you look at ( @entity104 ) @entity103 , if you look at the first lap he pitted and then he finished sixth			0
so the field is very tight			0
