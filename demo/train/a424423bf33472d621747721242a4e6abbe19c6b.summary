@entity1 gov. @entity0 is calling for calm amid a back - and - forth of finger - pointing between activists , police leaders and elected officials following the execution - style murder of two @entity1 police officers this weekend			1
@entity0 called for a " societal deep breath " and a " cooling off period " this week in a radio interview monday on @entity1 's @entity10 , calling the heated , inflammatory rhetoric that engulfed the city this weekend unproductive			1
" sometimes with high emotion you stop hearing and processing			0
and i think that 's where we are now			0
it 's not productive , it 's potentially destructive , " @entity0 said			1
" people have strong feelings			0
i understand that , i respect that , but i ask people to join me to bring a period of calm this week			2
" former @entity1 mayor @entity27 tied the police murders to " intense , anti-police hatred " among leaders and activists reacting to the non-indictment of two white police officers who killed two unarmed black men in separate instances this summer			2
and the leader of the city 's largest police union directly blamed @entity1 mayor @entity39 for the murders , saying the officers ' blood is " on many hands , " starting " on the steps of @entity44 in the office of the mayor			0
" when asked if @entity39 had the governor 's full support , @entity0 said the mayor , union leaders and community activists have his " full support			2
" @entity0 insisted several times he would not get dragged into the divisive business of assigning blame to anyone			2
" i think that is the negative cycle that we are in			0
i do n't want to point fingers , i do n't want to cast blame , " @entity0 said			1
" i think mayor de @entity39 is doing the best he can under very difficult circumstances to hear all sides of the matter			0
you have polarization in this city and that 's the fundamental issue			0
you have two different points of view that right now are seemingly irreconcilable			0
" @entity0 said he was interested in starting a dialogue on reforms to address both @entity74 's killing by a police officer this summer and the murder of the two police officers this weekend , but only after a " cooling off period			1
" those reforms would build off of concerns he said he 's heard that range from grand jury secrecy to survivors ' benefits for police officers and whether police car windows should be bulletproof			0
@entity0 also said the grand jury decision in @entity74 's chokehold death at the hands of a police officers " was seemingly wholly incongruous with what you saw in that video			1
" @entity74 's death was captured on camera , and @entity74 can be heard saying " i ca n't breathe " in the video			1
@entity0 added that " there are legitimate points " in @entity74 's case .			1
