president @entity0 tried to shame the nation and @entity2 into action against gun violence thursday , saying it is time to pass new laws after the tears and grief of tragedies like the @entity11 massacre in december that killed 20 first - graders			1
" we need everybody to remember how we felt 100 days ago and make sure that what we said at that time was n't just a bunch of platitudes , that we meant it , " @entity0 said at a @entity14 event on a national day of action by supporters of tougher gun laws			1
his voice both somber and angry , @entity0 told the audience , which included family members of @entity11 victims , that " we 've cried enough " and it is time now for @entity30 to pressure their elected leaders to pass a package of laws proposed by @entity34			1
the proposals , all recommended by the president in the aftermath of the killings at an elementary school in @entity41 , include expanded background checks , tougher laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases , and improving safety at schools			1
fierce opposition led by the influential @entity49 and conservative politicians has made passage of the measures uncertain			2
in addition , polls conducted over the past few weeks suggest that more than three months after the @entity11 killings , public backing for major new gun laws has dropped			1
@entity0 noted the political challenge as well as the poll numbers			2
" there are some powerful voices on the other side who are interested in running out the clock , or changing the subject , " the president said , adding that " their assumption is that people will just forget about it			2
" if that happens , @entity0 said , then " shame on us if we 've forgotten			2
" in trying to rally further public outcry , he declared that " nothing is more powerful than millions of voices calling for change			0
" along with the @entity14 event , the national day of action included rallies and other gatherings in cities across the country by supporters of new gun legislation			0
" there are 80 million moms in this country , " said @entity86 , founder of @entity87 in @entity30 , after the @entity14 event			1
" this is a non-partisan issue			2
it does n't matter if you 're a @entity94 or if you 're a @entity95			0
we need to come together under one umbrella and say ' enough			0
' " in addition , a group called @entity100 launched a $ 12 million ad campaign targeting members of @entity2 in 10 states to act on the legislation backed by @entity0 and approved by the @entity105 on mostly partisan lines			2
another proposal passed by the committee -- a ban on semiautomatic firearms that are modeled after military assault rifles -- already appears doomed			0
senate majority leader @entity112 dropped the ban -- proposed by sen. @entity114 , @entity115 -- from the package going to the @entity34 floor because it lacked enough support to overcome a @entity94 filibuster			1
@entity112 said it can still be offered as an amendment to force a vote , as sought by @entity0 and @entity114			0
@entity11 families featured in first political ad even if gun legislation passes the @entity127 - led @entity34 , it has less chance of winning approval in the @entity94 - controlled @entity14			2
@entity0 rejected arguments by opponents of the legislation that the measures would strip @entity30 of their constitutional right to bear arms			1
" what we 're proposing is not radical			0
it 's not taking away anyone 's guns rights , " the president said in warning legislators against getting " squishy because time has passed and maybe it 's not on the news every day			0
" instead , he said , it 's time to demonstrate that the @entity30 character includes being " willing to follow through on what we say is important			0
" @entity0 and others pushing for tougher gun laws say the december attack by a lone gunman that killed 20 first - graders and six educators at @entity11 in @entity11 , @entity41 , showed the need for national action against gun violence			1
they note the killer , 20 - year - old @entity160 , used a semiautomatic rifle with 30 - round capacity magazines , both of which would be banned under @entity114 's proposal			0
opponents of tougher gun laws , led by the @entity49 , argue most gun violence involves pistols in urban areas , rather than the semiautomatic firearms targeted by @entity114			1
better enforcement of existing laws and posting armed security guards in schools would be more effective remedies , according to the @entity49			0
@entity86 , however told reporters her group of @entity30 moms rejects the @entity49 prescription for the country			1
" we are not going to put our kids in schools with shields and send them to school in bulletproof backpacks and let the good guys shoot it out with the bad guys over our kids ' heads , " @entity86 said			0
police released new documents thursday related to the @entity11 shootings that say police found more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition in the home where @entity160 killed his mother with one of her own guns , shooting her in the forehead as she lay in bed			0
@entity160 then went to the elementary school , shooting his way inside and opening fire on classrooms with a semiautomatic rifle before killing himself to end the rampage , which lasted less than five minutes , the documents showed			0
documents reveal new details about @entity11 shootings , but no motive " this is exactly why we need to ban high - capacity magazines and why we need to tighten our assault weapons ban , " @entity41 gov. @entity213 said thursday			0
" i do n't know what more we can need to know before we take decisive action to prevent gun violence			0
" after the @entity11 shootings , some states -- including @entity222 -- passed tougher gun laws			1
while the fervor for stronger legislation was high in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , a @entity225 survey released this week indicates a 10 - point decrease in support of stricter gun laws , from 57 % immediately after the @entity11 shootings to 47 % now			1
that poll was in line with a @entity238 / @entity237 survey released last week that indicated a 9 - point drop in the percentage of @entity30 who favor major restrictions on guns or an outright ban on gun ownership , from 52 % following the shootings to 43 %			2
other polls have shown changes in the same downward direction			0
" opinion on gun control was fairly steady over the past few years , but seemed to spike after the @entity41 shootings , " @entity238 polling director @entity250 said			0
" the big question is whether support for major new gun laws has simply dropped back down to that previous level or whether the slide will continue even further			1
" opinion : did we learn nothing from @entity11 ? he noted that the biggest drop came among two specific demographics -- older @entity30 and people who live in rural areas			2
" in the immediate aftermath of the shootings in @entity41 , the number of rural @entity30 who supported major gun restrictions rose to 49 % but now that support has dropped 22 points , " @entity250 said			1
" support for stricter gun laws dropped 16 points among @entity30 over 50 years old in that same time			1
" however , @entity0 noted that polls also show strong support across the spectrum , including among gun owners , for expanding background checks to prevent firearms from ending up in the hands of the mentally ill and criminals			1
the @entity225 poll showed that 90 % of respondents agreed , and the president noted that support , asking thursday " how often do 90 % of @entity30 agree on anything ? " he urged people to find out where their congressional representatives stand on the gun legislation , adding that if a legislator is n't " part of the 90 % , ask why not			1
" polls suggest @entity2 might have waited too long on gun control			0

@entity86 , head of an @entity30 mothers ' group , says the issue is non-partisan
president @entity0 urges people to pressure elected leaders to pass new gun laws
the @entity34 will take up a package of proposals , but passage is uncertain
polls show support for new gun laws is on the wane
