@entity0 -- @entity3 plans a return to yesteryear by developing a space capsule that will carry humans into deep space , it announced tuesday			2
" we are committed to human exploration beyond low - earth orbit and look forward to developing the next generation of systems to take us there , " @entity3 administrator @entity9 said			2
the new spacecraft , to be built by @entity17 , will be known as the @entity18 , or @entity19			2
it will carry four astronauts and be based on designs originally planned for @entity3 's @entity18 , whose development was canceled by president @entity25			2
@entity3 says astronauts would not fly onboard until at least 2016			1
@entity3 has not flown astronauts beyond low - earth orbit since the @entity29 , in the 1970s			0
" we hope to have test flights in this decade			0
we 're not sure when but certainly as early as possible , " said @entity31 , @entity3 's associate administrator for exploration systems mission			0
like the @entity29 spacecraft , which landed 12 men on the moon , the @entity19 will splash down in the @entity36 upon return to @entity38			1
however , the new craft will be the 21st - century version : much larger and 10 times safer to launch and land than the space shuttle , @entity3 says			1
" we would have an abort system , all the way from sitting on the pad , to flying up , up and away			0
the space shuttle has never had that capability , " @entity31 said			1
this new spacecraft is @entity3 's first step forward in its next great leap , as the @entity51 space shuttle program heads into retirement			1
officials say this vehicle will be able to go to the moon or do a deep space mission to @entity57			1
any deep space mission would be accompanied by a larger compartment for the crew , @entity31 said			1
the @entity19 is currently at @entity17 's facility in @entity62 , undergoing testing			0
@entity3 is hoping to start flying as soon as possible to close the gap in the @entity51 manned space program			1
with the retirement of the space shuttle , expected in july , the @entity51 will have to pay the @entity68 to take astronauts back and forth from the station until the @entity19 is ready			1
@entity3 is also hoping that private , commercial companies will soon be able to fly astronauts to the space station in newly developed vehicles			0
the original @entity18 spacecraft was part of @entity3 's @entity77 to take man back to the moon , and later , to @entity57			1
in 2010 , it was resurrected , and downsized to be used as a " lifeboat , " in the event of an emergency on the space station			0
five billion dollars have already been spent on @entity18 -- another reason to keep the design			0
@entity3 has not yet developed a rocket powerful enough to propel this spacecraft out of @entity38 's atmosphere			0
" as we aggressively continue our work on a heavy - lift - launch vehicle , we are moving forward with an existing contract to keep development of our new crew vehicle on track , " @entity91 said			2
@entity25 has committed $ 3 billion for @entity3 to develop the heavy - lift - launch vehicle .			0

new craft wo *n't* be ready until 2016 at earliest
it could go to moon or @entity57
separate crew compartment needed to go *farther*
@entity107 *intended* to fill gap created by end to shuttle program
