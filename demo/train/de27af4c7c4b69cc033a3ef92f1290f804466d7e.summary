for all the noise about the @entity3 's final environmental review of the @entity4 being a " blow " to pipeline opponents , the report contains more than enough information for secretary of state @entity8 -- a respected environmental champion -- to conclude that the pipeline is not in the national interest			1
although you have to dig a bit , the report recognizes the dangers associated with the tar sands fuel that the pipeline would transport			1
oil from tar sands spews 17 % more greenhouse gas than the average crude oil refined in the @entity19			1
if the pipeline operates at capacity , that 's as much carbon pollution as 5.7 million more cars driving on our roads			0
this is enough added pollution to erase as much as 70 % of the carbon pollution reductions from the @entity30 administration 's recent motor vehicle emission standards			2
using the @entity30 administration 's estimates of the social cost of carbon , that adds up to $ 128 billion in climate costs over the lifetime of the project , costs that can too often be measured in parched farmland , compromised human health and property damage from floods			0
so how does the report admit the possibility of lasting environmental harm from the tar sands on the one hand while concluding that building the pipeline would not cause an increase in greenhouse gas emissions on the other ? it presumes that the tar sands fuels are going to get to market anyway , so the environmental damage happens with or without @entity4			1
opinion : keystone a pipeline to future of dirty fuel we think this presumption is seriously flawed			0
one key assumption is the report 's forecast that crude oil prices will stay above $ 75 per barrel			1
below that price , the report actually finds that @entity4 does make a difference in driving tar sands production and greater carbon pollution			1
contrary to the report 's assumptions , there is a real chance that crude oil prices will fall below that level			1
energy commodity traders at the @entity78 and experts at the @entity80 forecast a sharp decline in oil prices over the next decade			0
the @entity84 's low oil price forecast , which assumes slower economic growth in developing countries , projects oil prices around $ 75 or below from 2015 through 2040			0
in addition , the more successful international efforts are at promoting energy efficiency and new forms of clean energy , the more demand for traditional fossil fuels will shrink , pushing prices down			0
the report also presumes that all tar sands growth will come from low - cost projects , and higher cost tar sands projects wo n't be built with or without the pipeline			2
that 's unrealistic : higher cost projects are moving forward , but their continued economic viability will depend on variables such as low - cost transportation as well as sufficiently high oil prices			0
the tar sands producers themselves belie the claim that @entity4 wo n't make a difference in bringing the tar sands to market			1
the ceo of major tar sands producer @entity114 admitted that his company 's plan to triple production in coming years was contingent on more pipeline capacity			2
financial giants such as @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 have all linked the size of the tar sands industry to the availability of new pipelines			2
the desperate push over this pipeline shows how badly tar sands producers need @entity4			1
opinion : @entity4 pipeline makes sense perhaps most serious , the @entity3 report fails to take into account the actions needed to prevent catastrophic climate change			1
in @entity139 , @entity140 , in 2009 , the @entity19 and more than 100 other nations agreed that we need to limit the global temperature increase from carbon pollution to 2 degrees @entity144 ( 3.6 degrees @entity145 )			0
president @entity30 affirmed that goal in his @entity147			0
according to the models used in @entity150 analysis , we must keep atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations below 450 parts per million to achieve the 2 degrees target			0
that 's not possible if we maintain the status quo , much less bring online more and exceedingly dirty sources of fuel such as tar sands oil			1
in a glaring omission , the @entity4 review failed to factor in the 2 degrees limit , and assumed the continuation of business - as - usual practices for the next quarter century			2
we have almost no chance of meeting the 2 degree goal if any of the report 's scenarios are realized			0
@entity8 's obligation is to determine what is in the national interest			2
for all its flaws , the report acknowledges that the tar sands that would get to market through @entity4 could significantly worsen climate change			1
that 's a risk that climate champions such as @entity8 and @entity30 should n't be willing to take .			0

**writers** : review of @entity4 information shows it 's not in the national interest
they say tar sands oil spews 17 % more greenhouse gas than crude oil refined in the @entity19
**writers** : report acknowledges tar sands oil from @entity4 could worsen climate change
oil companies will need even more pipelines to reach their goals , they say
