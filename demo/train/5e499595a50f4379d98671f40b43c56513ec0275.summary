-- at thursday 's @entity3 confirmation hearing , @entity1 will finally get to answer his critics			1
the decorated @entity6 veteran and two - term @entity8 senator from @entity9 is president @entity11 's choice to be the next secretary of defense			1
but the bipartisan pick has n't brought the two parties together			0
instead , a cadre of conservative activists have been trying to drum up opposition to @entity18 ever since his name was first floated in what has amounted to a pre-emptive attack on not just his policies but , too often , his character			1
it 's time for a reality check			0
the @entity29 campaign has accused him of being everything from " out of the mainstream " to anti-israel to anti-semitic to anti-gay -- serious charges , if true			2
politics : five things @entity18 may be asked but let 's be honest : @entity18 's cardinal sin among neo-conservatives was his outspoken opposition to @entity44 - era foreign policy in @entity45 and his decision to break @entity8 ranks and not support the 2007 @entity45 surge			1
good people can disagree on policy and personnel ; my wife and i disagree on the @entity55 nomination			0
a confirmation hearing can usefully clear up any sincere questions			0
but a look at the facts , armed with a sense of perspective , suggests that it might be @entity18 's most vociferous critics who are outside the historic mainstream , not @entity18 himself			1
@entity18 's unvarnished independence is well - known in @entity66 , but his opposition to the quagmire of the @entity45 war is not idiosyncratic			1
it is philosophically consistent with being a small government conservative and a @entity6 veteran , suspicious of calls to war by people who wo n't have to serve in the combat zone			1
he still carries shrapnel in his chest from being wounded in @entity6			2
after his war service , he said , " i made myself a promise that if i ever got out of that place and was ever in a position to do something about war -- so horrible , so filled with suffering -- i would do whatever i could to stop it			0
i have never forgotten that promise			0
" this does n't mean @entity18 is some kind of pacifist			2
but as the first enlisted man to serve in combat to be nominated for secretary of defense , he does have a grunt 's - eye view of war and a commitment to making it a last resort , consistent with our national interest -- hence his reasonable regrets about the invasion of @entity45 and his caution about charging into a war with @entity110			1
politics : @entity112 moves from backer to skeptic on @entity18 " we blundered into @entity45 because of flawed intelligence , flawed assumptions , flawed judgments , and ideologically driven motives , " he wrote in his 2008 memoir , " @entity116 : our next chapter : tough questions , @entity124			1
" " we must not repeat these errors with @entity110 and the best way to avoid them is to maintain an effective dialogue			0
preventing an @entity110 nuclear weapon is in the interest of both the @entity116 and the world community			0
" he also repeatedly calls @entity110 a state sponsor of terrorism			0
as part of the effort to contain @entity110 's ambitions , @entity18 believes that multilateral sanctions are more effective than unilateral sanctions , a belief largely borne out by experience			1
this policy disagreement is worthy of debate , but it is far from a disqualification			0
in 2012 , @entity18 co-wrote an opinion piece with a bipartisan group of former congressmen and military leaders on stopping @entity110 from getting a nuclear bomb			2
it said , " our position is fully consistent with the policy of presidents for more than a decade of keeping all options on the table , including the use of military force , thereby increasing pressure on @entity110 while working toward a political solution			0
" this policy is common sense , consistent with that of both president @entity44 and @entity11 , and entirely within the mainstream			0
and yet , the accusation that @entity18 is out of the mainstream on @entity110 and @entity167 percolates because it is in the talking points			1
an early broadside came from @entity171 , which published an anonymous e-mail , allegedly from a @entity174 aide , reading , " send us @entity18 and we will make sure every @entity116 knows he is an anti-semite			2
" this is a serious accusation and a transparent attempt to intimidate			0
anti-semitism is a rightfully toxic charge			0
@entity167 is @entity116 's closest ally in the world , along with the @entity183			0
but in a recent interview with his hometown paper in @entity187 , @entity9 , @entity18 said that his record demonstrates " unequivocal , total support for @entity167			2
" in his memoir , @entity18 devotes an entire chapter to " @entity194 : @entity167 and the @entity195 , " full of calls for negotiated peace with statements like this : " there is one important given that is not negotiable : a comprehensive solution should not include any compromise regarding @entity167 's @entity205 identity , which must be assured			1
the @entity167 people must be free to live in peace and security			0
" for what it 's worth , five former ambassadors to @entity167 have endorsed @entity18 's nomination , and former @entity167 consul gen. @entity213 has clarified that @entity18 is " not anti-israel			1
" politics : why some conservatives are still going after @entity18 the anti-gay charge has been pushed by the @entity217 as well as some liberal groups for @entity18 's opposition to @entity221 's 1998 nomination of the openly gay @entity222 to serve as ambassador of @entity224			1
at the time , @entity18 questioned the wisdom of having an " openly , aggressively gay " ambassador -- a statement that reflects the unevolved times on this issue			2
@entity235 of the gay conservative group @entity234 questioned the @entity238 's aggressive promotion of this line of attack , tweeting , " the @entity238 website uses the @entity18 is anti-gay smear , anyone told them to take a look at the @entity8 platform recently ? " the final reality check relates to the conservative senators who have criticized their former colleague			1
in 2006 , @entity112 said he 'd be " honored to have @entity1 with me in any capacity			0
he 'd make a great secretary of state			0
" but after @entity18 was nominated by @entity11 , @entity112 questioned @entity18 's " overall attitude toward the @entity116 and the world			1
" @entity8 leader @entity251 also broadly praised @entity18 as recently as 2009 , saying , " @entity1 has earned the respect of his colleagues and risen to national prominence as a clear voice on foreign policy and national security			2
" this generous perspective is unlikely to be recollected by conservatives during the confirmation hearings			0
since his nomination , @entity18 has been diligently working the corridors of @entity264 , trying to address concerns directly			2
he 's also met with leaders of organizations like the @entity269 and the @entity270 to address the accusations behind closed doors			0
consider the attacks on @entity18 against the backdrop of facts , with a sense of perspective			1
and then look at the staunch defenders of @entity18 's nomination : @entity280 secretary of defense @entity280 , @entity281 secretary of state @entity281 , @entity284 's respected secretary of defense @entity282 and the first president @entity44 's national security adviser @entity285			1
the bottom line : @entity1 is squarely in the @entity288 @entity8 tradition			0
that he is being relentlessly attacked by some neoconservatives reflects how much their " you 're either with us or against us " attitude has strayed out of the historic mainstream			2
listen : @entity18 's other war policy differences can and should be debated , but stooping to personal smears smacks of desperation			1
it is doubly ironic because @entity18 's appointment by a @entity301 president is designed to help re-center @entity116 foreign policy , reminding us all of some forgotten @entity305 era wisdom articulated by @entity306 sen. @entity306 during the @entity308 administration : " partisan politics ought to end at the water 's edge			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity314 .			2

@entity314 : critics targeted @entity18 since he was nominated for secretary of defense
@entity314 : @entity18 *wrongly* called anti-gay , @entity319 , but it 's really about opposing @entity45 war
@entity18 is a mainstream conservative and @entity6 vet , wary of calls to war , he says
@entity314 : *unfounded* attacks show " you 're with us or against us " neoconservative view
