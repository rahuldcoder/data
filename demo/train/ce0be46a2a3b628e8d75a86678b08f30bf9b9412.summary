-- the woman 's @entity2 costume featured a @entity5 motif			1
this was last weekend in a sprawling bar - and - restaurant complex near @entity8 41 on the west coast of @entity10			1
i had made the miscalculation of stopping by in pursuit of a quiet cheeseburger , not realizing that adults in trick - or - treat costumes were making the rounds on this sultry evening			2
the woman ( or the costume shop from where she had purchased her uniform ) at least had the good sense to omit the actual swastikas , but that was the only bit of subtlety			2
the @entity26 high - fronted military cap , the boots , the swagger stick she kept slapping against her palm			2
some of the customers , playing along , did little comic goose steps as they passed her			2
i looked up from my newspaper and tried to surmise if anyone was going to be offended enough by this odious display to leave			2
she beat them to it ; she and her friends made a few quick passes through the aisles of the place , then returned to the night , ready to continue their revelry elsewhere			2
@entity2 in the @entity8 is an increasingly odd holiday , no longer child 's play , but on this evening i was thinking about another holiday , this one official , that is coming up this week : @entity48			1
and , having unexpectedly encountered the woman in her getup , i found myself wondering what , six and seven decades ago , they would have made of it : what the 16 million @entity8 who served in the armed forces during @entity56 , who were sent across the ocean to defeat a brutal enemy , would have thought about this scene			1
they 're old men now , the soldiers who remain ; many are frail and in ill health			2
it can be easy for us to forget that , when they were uprooted from their daily lives in the 1940s , no one knew what the history books would eventually say			1
no one knew the outcome			2
they were little more than kids , many of them ; they were in effect told by our country : are you in school ? you 'll have to leave it			2
have a new wife ? you 'll have to say goodbye to her			2
working at a job you like ? tell your boss that you have to quit			0
we need you to go halfway across the world , because we need you to save the world			0
some 292,000 @entity8 soldiers , sailors , airmen and @entity95 were killed in battle during @entity56 ; another 114,000 died from noncombat causes			1
some 671,000 @entity8 troops were injured , many of them grievously			1
the uniforms they put on were not @entity2 getups ; neither were the uniforms of the enemies they confronted across the oceans			0
on their way to fight the war , it 's a pretty fair guess that they were scared and lonely			1
they understood that there was no guarantee they would ever be coming home			0
each november we are asked to pause and honor them , which is , or should be , an honor in itself			0
after the events of the last week at @entity121 in @entity122 , with their reminder of the sacrifices that the men and women of the military make for us , @entity48 will hold special meaning this year			1
this november also marks the second anniversary of the death , at age 92 , of my friend @entity133 , who i got to know extraordinarily well during the last years of his life			0
i 'd like to say a few words about him here			0
at the age of 29 , out of all the men and women in the @entity8 military , he was selected for a task of almost unfathomable importance			1
he was told to recruit , organize , supervise and command a group of soldiers and airmen who were to train in absolute secrecy			0
if he succeeded , he was told , then the war could be won			0
someone had started a terrible fight ; he was asked to finish it			1
he got his unit ready			0
and on an august day in 1945 , he flew a @entity154 he had named for his mother , @entity155 , to @entity156 , where he and his crew dropped the atomic bomb on @entity159			0
it was the single most violent act in the history of mankind , and he carried it out without flinching because he believed , in the deepest part of his heart , one thing above all others : he could end the long war			0
he could stop the killing			0
all of the @entity8 soldiers who were on their way to the shores of @entity156 for a land invasion could turn around and go home , could raise families , could live again in a world at peace			1
he understood the controversy , and the anger , with which his mission would be received by some			0
he understood that there were people who would forever hate him			1
he and i talked about it many times before he died			1
after the war , he told me , president @entity187 asked him if people were saying unpleasant things to him because of the bomb			1
@entity133 told the president that , yes , some people indeed were			1
and @entity187 said : " you tell them that if they have anything to say , they should call me			0
i 'm the one who sent you			0
" so it 's november again			1
there is a quotation variously attributed to @entity203 or @entity204			0
regardless of our individual politics , regardless of our beliefs about the rightness or wrongness of a particular war , the words are worth reflecting upon anew this week : " we sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm			0
" and so , to all who have served us , then , now , and in the future , a word of somber thanks , from those of us here at home			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity224 : sometimes people make light of @entity56 ; that 's a mistake
he says there was nothing funny about the battle a *generation* faced
lives were *disrupted* , *hundreds* of thousands died or were injured , he says
he says @entity8 *liberties* depend on willingness of troops to fight
