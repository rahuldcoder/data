@entity0 -- @entity3 's military insists that the @entity5 strike last month that killed more than two dozen @entity3 soldiers near the @entity8 border was deliberate			1
in an effort to pre-empt the results of @entity5 's official investigation , due out next week , the @entity9 in @entity0 invited reporters for a detailed briefing on the incident			0
@entity3 military officials at the briefing contended that @entity5 forces knew they were firing at @entity3 troops throughout the attack and even apologized as they kept firing , evidence they say supports their assertions the attack was deliberate			1
@entity25 officials have said it was a regrettable case of mistaken identity and miscommunication when @entity5 attacked the area in support of a nearby @entity25 - @entity8 joint patrol that believed it was under fire from the @entity32			1
" i have a story to tell and this is the story of those brave people who left us in the middle of a cold , november night on a barren mountain top , " a senior @entity3 defense official began			0
using maps , photos and powerpoint charts , he offered a painstaking recreation of the incident from the @entity3 military 's point of view , based on interviews with surviving troops and residents where the attack took place			1
he and embassy officials at the briefing spoke on the condition of anonymity , preferring for their military and civilian leadership in @entity59 to speak on the record			0
at issue is whether @entity3 troops were the target of the attacks			2
the @entity3 officials at the briefing argued that well - established operating procedures and an intricate system for operational information sharing were deliberately ignored , which led to the tragic incident that killed 24 @entity3 " martyrs			0
" @entity25 officials told @entity1 that @entity25 forces checked first with their @entity3 counterparts before launching the strike			1
before calling in airstrikes , the @entity25 forces checked with a @entity3 liaison team			2
they were not seeking permission -- because the airstrikes were described as a matter of self - defense -- but were making sure @entity3 troops were n't in what was called a poorly marked border area , the officials said			1
after that consultation , the @entity25 believed there were no @entity3 forces nearby , which turned out not to be true			2
@entity25 military officials would not comment on the @entity3 assertions , citing the ongoing investigation			1
but in the past few weeks , @entity25 officials have denied vehemently the charge by @entity3 's military that this was a deliberate attack			1
" what i can say , absolutely , and i ca n't imagine anyone in this room would n't believe me -- we did not attack a border post , a @entity3 military border post , intentionally , " @entity93 , chairman of the @entity94 , said in a speech in @entity0 last week			1
" if you think we did , i 'd have to ask you in return what in the world would we hope to gain by doing that ? so i can say that categorically			0
@entity93 said , " they believe we did this intentionally in some way to either discredit them or goad them into further action			0
" @entity115 spokesman @entity114 said , " we know enough at this point to say with certainty this was not an intentional attack on @entity3 forces			0
the @entity3 are our partners ; it defies reason that we would attack them			0
" but @entity3 officials at the embassy briefing said that not only were the coordinates incorrect , covering an area nine miles north of the attack , but @entity3 's chain of command was in the process of reviewing them when @entity5 helicopters began the striking @entity3 outpost " @entity132 " shortly after midnight			1
@entity3 only returned fire after its first post was fired upon , which prompted @entity5 to strike against the second post , " @entity138 , " the officials said , adding that the commanding officer who ran up the hill to the area with a rescue team was killed			2
a @entity5 officer at the joint coordination outpost in the area even apologized to his @entity3 liaison in the middle of the attack for relaying the wrong location of the area @entity5 planes were about to fire on , preventing @entity3 from warning this was a friendly post , according to the @entity3 officials			2
even after @entity5 officer acknowledged at about 1:15 a.m. that it was firing on the outposts and confirmed it was pulling back its helicopters , the @entity3 maintain there was continued fire on the two posts by @entity25 attack helicopters and an ac - 130 gunship for about another hour until about 2:20 a.m. neither claim could be verified with @entity5 and @entity25 officials			1
could @entity5 forces have mistaken the two border posts on the @entity8 border for extremist bases , as @entity25 officials have suggested ? highly unlikely , the senior @entity3 defense official said at the briefing			1
first of all , the structures stood in plain view on the top of a barren ridge -- a place he said , which terrorists probably would n't be inclined to use as a hideout			0
photos of both posts that suffered the attack show the structures made of stone and sandbags sitting on high ground			0
a slide at the presentation called " @entity191 " tried to casts further doubt on the @entity25 argument			0
the slide detailed several ways @entity3 and its @entity5 counterparts keep track of each other 's activities at the border			2
the defense official claimed that @entity5 was even monitoring the @entity3 border posts ' radio transmissions reporting it was under fire by @entity5 aircraft			0
what 's more , he said , the @entity3 military has shown its counterparts at several coordination centers maps of where it has outposts so as to avoid such misunderstandings			2
" it 's something which just does n't make any sense to me given the kind of coordination mechanism we have , the kind of information - sharing we have , given the fact that these locations are mutually known to both sides , " he said			0
the official would not speculate as to why @entity5 would deliberately attack two @entity3 outposts about 300 yards from the border , but would only say this was the official conclusion of the @entity3 leadership			2
the incident has exacerbated an already fractious relationship between the @entity25 and @entity3 , whose military has been on the defensive since the secret raid by @entity236 that killed @entity237 in may			1
since the attack on @entity237 's compound in @entity241 , close to @entity3 military installations , tensions have been at record levels			2
but last month 's attack seems to have been the last straw , with @entity3 shutting @entity5 supply routes until it receives an official apology			1
the @entity25 has expressed " condolences " for the loss of the @entity3 soldiers but wo n't go as far as to issue an " apology " until the @entity5 investigation is complete			1
@entity3 has explicitly refused to coordinate with investigation , saying it does n't trust @entity5			0
regardless of the results of the investigation , officials say the incident has further solidified @entity3 military and public opinion against cooperation with @entity5 and the @entity25			1
" there is a sense of outrage , " one senior official said			0
" it 's there on the street , amongst the leadership -- political as well as military -- and among the rank and file of the military			0
the sheer magnitude of this thing is unbelievable			0

@entity3 military officials say @entity5 forces knew they were firing at @entity3 troops
@entity25 has said last month 's attack was a case of mistaken identity , miscommunication
more than two dozen @entity3 soldiers killed in @entity5 strike near the @entity8 border
strike has exacerbated already fractious relationship between @entity25 and @entity3
