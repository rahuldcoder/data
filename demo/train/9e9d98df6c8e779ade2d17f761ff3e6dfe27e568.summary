@entity0 -- today is a good day for liberty			0
by striking down the unprecedented requirement that @entity4 buy health insurance -- the " individual mandate " -- judge @entity7 vindicated the idea that ours is a government of delegated and enumerated , and thus limited , powers			1
but this should not be surprising , for the @entity12 does not grant the federal government the power to force private commercial transactions			1
even if the @entity17 has broadened the scope of @entity20 ' authority under the @entity21 -- it can now reach local activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce -- never before has it allowed people to face a civil penalty for declining to buy a particular product			1
@entity7 found therefore that the individual mandate " is neither within the letter nor the spirit of the @entity12			1
" stated another way , every exercise of @entity20 ' power to regulate interstate commerce has involved some form of action or transaction engaged in by an individual or legal entity			0
the government 's theory -- that the decision not to buy insurance is an economic one that affects interstate commerce in various ways -- would , for the first time ever , permit laws commanding people to engage in economic activity			1
under such a reading , which judges in two other cases have unfortunately adopted , nobody would ever be able to plausibly claim that the @entity12 limits congressional power			1
the federal government would then have wide authority to require that @entity4 engage in activities ranging from eating spinach and joining gyms ( in the health care realm ) to buying @entity62 cars			1
@entity20 could tell people what to study or what job to take : we need fewer lawyers and more engineers , right ? as @entity7 put it , " this broad definition of the economic activity subject to congressional regulation lacks logical limitation and is unsupported by @entity21 jurisprudence			2
" indeed , not even in the infamous 1942 case of @entity75 -- when the @entity17 ratified @entity20 ' regulation of what farmers grew in their backyards on the theory that such local activity , in the aggregate , affects national wheat prices -- have courts faced such a breathtaking assertion of raw federal power			1
even at the height of the @entity88 , @entity20 did not attempt to force people to buy wheat to support the new national agricultural policy			2
so too now , when there is a stark difference between @entity20 ' power to regulate the health insurance industry and a purported power to require someone to buy health insurance			1
it 's the same difference as between the power to regulate the auto industry and -- under some scheme to bail out companies that are " too big to fail " -- to require everyone to buy a @entity105			2
to be sure , there are situations in which the government may force individuals to engage in business			0
most notably , it can require hotels and restaurants to serve all patrons			0
but nobody has to become a hotelier or restaurateur , or purchase lodging or food -- and individuals are not commercial enterprises			0
as for the oft - invoked car insurance analogy , being required to buy insurance if you choose to drive is different from having to buy it because you are alive			0
and it is states that impose car insurance mandates , under their general police powers -- which the federal government lacks			2
and so today was a bad day for those who say that @entity20 is the arbiter of its own powers and that the only checks on federal power in the regulation of commerce are political			0
we have come far from the time when pundits dismissed the lawsuits challenging the new health care law as frivolous political gimmicks			0
this is still the beginning of a long legal journey -- there 's a hearing this thursday in the @entity150 - led 20 - state lawsuit , then appeals in all the various cases , and none of this will be over till the @entity17 has its say -- but we can now see the day where this unprecedented claim of federal power is definitively rejected as fundamentally contrary to our constitutional order			1
as @entity7 said , " despite the laudable intentions of @entity20 in enacting a comprehensive and transformative health care regime , the legislative process must still operate within constitutional bounds			0
@entity163 [ sic ] goals and creative drafting have never been sufficient to offset an absence of enumerated powers			0
" it is perhaps most appropriate that this ruling happened during the @entity170 season , for now we can all see that yes , @entity173 , there are limits on government			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

@entity178 : federal judge in @entity173 . says government ca *n't* mandate health insurance purchase
he says this is a correct reading of the @entity12 's " @entity21 "
mandating health insurance is akin to forcing people to buy a *consumer* product , he says
@entity178 : case is far from *settled* and will probably go to the @entity4 @entity17
