-- on january 12 , i went to basketball practice and then spent time with a kids ' basketball league			1
the whole time my phone was in the car			0
when i finally looked at it , i had about 50 messages saying , " have you been watching the news about @entity11 ? " it still haunts me to think that , as i went about my business that day , my homeland shuddered , crashed , and crumbled			1
more than 220,000 of my fellow @entity11 died			1
another 1.6 million were instantly left homeless -- most with nothing but the clothes on their backs			0
about 800,000 of them are children			2
@entity11 has never been an easy place to be a kid			1
when i was growing up in @entity23 , i felt lucky because i always had at least one meal a day			2
some of my friends were starving			2
but we all shared what we had with each other			0
we figured out ways to have fun with nothing but a small patch of dirt to play in			0
we got along with very little , and we told ourselves that -- if we got just the slightest opportunity -- we would grab onto it and use it to do great things			1
that is what @entity11 's children need now			1
it is amazing what kids can endure			2
@entity11 's children have held the hands of parents as they lay crushed and dying beneath rubble			1
they 've lost families , best friends , homes , schools			2
they can survive all that			2
but they ca n't thrive without us stepping up			0
right after the earthquake , the immediate and enormous generosity from people in the @entity56 made such a difference in @entity11 -- and it made me very proud to be part of this huge - hearted nation			1
organizations like @entity63 , which i have partnered with for years through my @entity64 , were able to provide emergency relief that stopped another wave of disaster in the form of disease and starvation			1
in the last six months , @entity63 has been providing water , food , shelter , immunizations , medicines , child protection , and education supplies to hundreds of thousands of @entity11 children and their families			1
but in many ways , the hard work is just beginning			0
and the need remains huge			0
those 1.6 million people left homeless are still living in tents and makeshift shelters -- and hurricane season is fast approaching			0
more than one third of the spontaneous settlements that have been created lack adequate sanitation , and this can make kids ill and lead to major disease outbreaks			2
people in settlements still rely on water being trucked in every day , and many do n't get enough considering the near 100 - degree heat			0
learn more about helping @entity11 at @entity99 education is going to make all the difference to @entity11 's future			1
given the opportunity to learn , the children who survived the earthquake will grow up to transform their nation and lead it towards prosperity			1
but before the earthquake , only four in ten kids went to school , and that number is even lower now			2
teachers are also absent because so many lost their homes and are now displaced			0
i was lucky enough to get the opportunity i dreamed of as a child in @entity11			1
and i started my foundation because i wanted to give other kids that chance , too			2
it 's my deep belief that those who are lucky enough to have success in this life should do something -- anything -- to help others			0
so i ask : even if you 've already been generous , do n't forget @entity11 now that it 's dropped from the news headlines			1
organizations like @entity63 are there for kids , but they need funds to rebuild schools , train teachers , set up feeding centers , immunize against disease , dig wells , install water pumps ... there are hundreds of thousands of very resilient kids in @entity11 who are surviving despite all they 've been through			1
they can endure a lot			0
living in tents in 100 - degree weather and rainstorms			0
but we do n't want a nation of kids just barely surviving -- we want a nation of leaders			0
@entity11 's children ca n't become leaders if they do n't go to school			1
they ca n't become leaders if they 're so hungry they ca n't concentrate			0
or if they have to spend their days selling sodas in the street to make a few pennies			0
they ca n't become leaders if the water they drink makes them chronically sick			0
or if they never get the vaccines that will keep deadly diseases away			0
if you join me in giving @entity11 's kids the opportunities they deserve , i can promise they will do great things			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity64 .			1
