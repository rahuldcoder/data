@entity0 -- introducing a new word : " cultuphobia			2
" it means the fear that another person 's culture is taking over your own			1
the word may be new , but the concept is ancient			2
@entity9 is a land of immigrants that has , in truth , never liked immigrants -- no matter where they came from and whether they came with the proper documents or a letter of reference from the @entity19			2
part of the reason that we do n't like immigrants is because they frighten us			1
and one way in which they frighten us is because we worry that -- with the changes they bring -- they 'll wind up marginalizing us and making us less important and less relevant			1
there is a name for that fear : cultuphobia			1
for an example , look at what happened this week to mark the launch of the new english - language , @entity40 - targeted television network fusion , founded by @entity41 and @entity42			2
the parent companies came up with what they thought was the cute idea of swapping anchors on their top - rated morning shows			1
the spanish - language show , " @entity9 , " which is based in @entity49 , sent hosts @entity50 and @entity52 to @entity53 for some early morning chitchat with @entity55 and @entity56 , the hosts of " @entity58			1
" meanwhile , @entity58 sent @entity59 and @entity60 to @entity49 to visit with the " @entity9 " crew			1
come to think of it , this was a pretty good idea			0
and no one seemed to enjoy it more than the hosts who switched places			1
in @entity53 , @entity50 and @entity52 were on the " @entity58 " set on the same day as @entity70 , who sang a new song			1
everyone seemed comfortable with one another , and there was a lot of laughing and dancing			0
in @entity49 , @entity76 told @entity77 that she " had no idea how much fun it was " to be on @entity81 - language television and implored producers to " please have me back			1
" champion proclaimed that he loved the experience and did n't want to go back to @entity53			1
" i 'm staying , " he told the website			0
more laughing and dancing , this time to mariachi music			0
it is no wonder that it all went so well , proclaimed @entity92 actor @entity91 , who was also a guest on " @entity9 " that day			0
his hit movie " @entity94 " is in limited release in the @entity96			0
after all , these days , the language barrier is just a puddle jump and , he said , among @entity101 in the @entity96 , " everyone speaks both @entity100 and @entity81			1
" here is where the story gets interesting			0
judging from the reaction on the " @entity58 " page on @entity107 and the comment section following news stories about the switch , many regular viewers of " @entity58 " did not appreciate the gimmick			1
in fact , many of them were furious			0
some said they changed the channel			1
others vowed to never watch the show again if there is a repeat performance			0
" this had better be a one - time thing , " wrote one disgruntled viewer			0
one woman complained that , when she tunes in to her favorite morning news show , she expects to get what she always gets -- the news of the day " in @entity129			1
" there 's the giveaway			0
for many of those angry " @entity58 " viewers , it might just have been a case of them preferring to stick with what they like			1
but for others , it was a case of cultuphobia			0
these viewers are n't just protecting their favorite show , but -- as they probably see it -- their language , culture and civilization			1
this is the other side to cultural marketing , and it 's ugly			2
a corporation -- or in this case , a media company such as @entity41 -- might vie for a larger market share by going after a new set of viewers and alienate its core audience members , who feel slighted , ignored or insulted			2
when that happens , the core is n't quiet			2
maybe next time , the company decides it is n't worth it			2
i hope that does n't happen here			2
i hope @entity41 will stand its ground and continue down this road of trying to reach @entity40 viewers			2
still , i 'm not sure how @entity165 will perform in the long run			0
i have concerns , and i 'm not alone			0
while the new network is marketed to younger viewers who speak @entity100 , it does n't seem that they 've thought deeply about how to reach their viewers			1
that 's not an easy demographic group to tap into , for either marketers or media			0
plus , @entity165 would be better off not becoming simply an english - language , hipper version of @entity42 , where -- as i would put it -- the anchors are white and the politics are blue			0
the liberal spanish - language network is all about advocacy journalism and protecting what it sees as the interests of @entity40 immigrants -- especially the undocumented			0
yet , on most of its telenovelas , which are produced in @entity92 , the lead actress is @entity191 - looking with light skin			0
so , at @entity42 , they seem to believe that dark - skinned immigrants should have the full pallet of rights -- except , apparently , the right to appear in a starring role on @entity81 - language television			1
that 's evidence of a different kind of phobia , and a depressing reminder that -- in either language , and either of side of the border -- people are the same , and prejudice is alive and well			0
@entity209 at @entity107 / @entity210			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213			1

@entity213 : " @entity215 " is fear that another culture is taking yours over
@entity213 : we worry that new cultural changes will marginalize us
when @entity81 hosts came to " @entity58 , " some viewers were upset
@entity213 : either they did n't like their morning routine changed , or they were " cultuphobic "
