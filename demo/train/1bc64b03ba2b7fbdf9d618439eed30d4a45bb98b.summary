@entity0 -- a @entity3 private security firm is denying claims its employees administered electric shocks and injected inmates with anti-psychotic drugs at a maximum security prison it ran in @entity11			1
the claims came to light through @entity14 , a human rights investigator with the @entity15 , who said she started her probe after receiving dozens of letters detailing abuse at the @entity19 near @entity20 , in the central part of the country			1
leaked videos also made their way to @entity14 , including one in which she says the sound of electric shocks can be heard , and someone screaming in excruciating pain			1
the security company , @entity30 , told @entity1 it does not use any form of torture or shock treatment , and that @entity30 staff and @entity36 services do not administer medication nor have access to it			2
@entity30 insists only independent , certified medical staff administer medications , not @entity30 security personnel			2
" the role of @entity30 staff is to prevent prisoners who are being treated from causing harm to other prisoners and staff			2
this is in accordance with the relevant legal guidelines , " the company said in a statement on its website monday			0
a representative for the company said the allegations are being taken very seriously and the company would be launching its own investigation into the matter			0
the @entity11 government is also investigating the actions of @entity30 and the independent medical team based at the prison			1
the results of that probe could come as early as friday			0
although it no longer runs the facility , @entity30 said in its statement there is " an active and independent inspection regime in place at the @entity19 prison , and there have never been any allegations or concerns regarding anything of this nature			1
" @entity14 told @entity1 that her investigation also revealed " that the prison was also forcibly injecting these inmates with anti-psychotic medication , according to the accounts of the inmates			0
" one video leaked to @entity14 shows uniformed @entity30 employees holding down a struggling inmate as he is given an injection			2
" i am not an animal ! " he is heard screaming			0
@entity14 said a health care worker reported that a certified medical staffer who is not a @entity30 employee gave the inmate an anti-psychotic drug despite no record of psychosis			0
the videos were shot by @entity30 employees themselves			2
according to its contract with the @entity11 government , the security team is obligated to document its actions and only allowed to use force under strict guidelines			1
the company says it can not verify the authenticity of the videos and strongly denies all allegations of mistreatment at the prison , which houses 3,000 inmates and is the second - largest private prison in the world , according to @entity30			1
documents obtained by @entity14 suggest the problems at the prison have been going on for some time			0
in 2010 , a @entity117 employee filed a classified memo to his superiors stating that the " state is being milked for work not done " and that the company uses " the cheapest methods " at the prison , describing the use of electric shock as routine			0
more than 300 @entity30 employees at the prison went on strike earlier this month , complaining of being ill - equipped and understaffed			1
the company responded by firing hundreds of them , which was followed by more violence at the notorious prison			0
the government ended up firing the firm , saying it had " lost effective control over the facility			1
" @entity140 has contracts across the globe , including with @entity143 , @entity145 security , the wimbledon tennis championships and dozens of red - carpet events			0
but it 's not the first time the company has come under scrutiny			0
@entity140 won the lucrative @entity153 contract to provide security staff for events , but was n't able to perform all its duties , forcing the @entity3 government to call in additional troops to secure the games .			1
