@entity0 and @entity1 are on course to meet in the @entity4 final for only the second time in 24 years after the great rivals cruised in the opening legs of their semifinals			1
@entity1 will be the happier of the sides , having impressed against @entity9 when winning 3 - 0 at home , so inflicting the @entity13 leaders ' first defeat in 25 matches			1
@entity0 were also at home but had to settle for a modest 2 - 0 win against @entity17 even though the visitors had to play an entire half with just ten men			1
after losing to @entity24 on saturday , as their first home league defeat in nearly two years knocked them off the top of @entity13 , coach @entity21 had stressed the need to ' cut short ' any crisis			0
the hosts took the lead late in the first half through @entity32 , with defender @entity33 sent off immediately after , with the visitors furious that @entity0 defender @entity35 had avoided both a potential red card and the concession of a penalty when hauling back @entity40 moments earlier			2
@entity0 's second came courtesy of a bizarre own goal as defender @entity44 's attempted clearance thumped into the chest of goalkeeper @entity46 before crossing the line			2
however , @entity0 's former assistant coach @entity48 , who worked at the club under @entity50 between 2003 - 2006 , was far from impressed			1
" that was the worst @entity0 display i have seen in the last six years , " the @entity51 told @entity53 television channel @entity52			2
" @entity0 needs a new team , as this is not a @entity0 that can compete with the best in @entity57			0
" @entity59 's comments come a fortnight before the four - time @entity62 champions take on @entity64 side @entity63 in the last 16 of the @entity65			0
they also come in the wake of last month 's resignation of president @entity69 , who stepped down because of a legal wrangle over the transfer of @entity72 last june			0
@entity0 fans also seemed to be voting with their feet , as the crowd of 38,000 was the club 's second lowest this season			0
meanwhile @entity1 , who take on @entity79 in the @entity65 later this month , won a hotly contested @entity1 derby thanks to goals from @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
" my wish is to have a team like the one that played tonight , " enthused @entity1 's @entity86 coach @entity85			0
a perfect scoreline was added to when @entity9 striker @entity94 , with 20 league goals this season , earned the booking that ruled him out of next week 's return leg			2
the suspension compounded a miserable night for the 25 - year - old who was victimized by real defensive duo @entity82 and @entity99			0
" we tried but we just could n't find a way tonight , " @entity9 coach @entity100 said afterwards			0
@entity9 won last season 's @entity4 after beating @entity1 2 - 1 in a final which was also littered with cynical fouls and gamesmaship			1
after meeting in the 1990 final , @entity1 and @entity0 have contested the @entity4 decider just once -- when @entity109 's @entity1 won 1 - 0 in 2011 thanks to an extra-time winner from @entity112			1
the following year , it was @entity0 's turn to get their hands on the trophy as they beat @entity117 3 - 0			1
this year 's final is set to take place on april 19			0
in @entity86 , a double from @entity120 , including a winner just two minutes from time , gave @entity123 a 3 - 2 victory over @entity125 in the first leg of their @entity127 semifinal			1
the in - form @entity129 's goals gave @entity123 their sixth straight win and frustrated a @entity125 side that had managed to level the scores despite trailing 2 - 0 after 32 minutes .			1

@entity1 and @entity0 set to meet in @entity4 final
