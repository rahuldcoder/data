all eyes were glued to the big guy in the gym			2
red - faced and sweaty , he must have been benching more than 300 pounds			0
but the weights were slipping			0
just as it looked as if he was going to get crushed by the immense burden dangling over his head , he tossed the weights up like it was no problem at all and popped up from the bench			0
he may have looked down for a minute , but he would not be defeated			0
but the thing i noticed most as he strutted around gasping for air was his @entity20 t - shirt			1
" that 's right , " i thought as i rode the elliptical machine at my local gym a few days ago			2
" that 's how we do			2
" it was the first time since 2011 , when the horrific @entity28 child abuse scandal was revealed , that i felt any pride or connection to my alma mater			2
in 2012 , @entity28 , the former assistant football coach , was sentenced to 30 - 60 years in prison for the sexual abuse of 10 boys after tearful testimony from his victims			0
since then , i 've wanted no association with the school or the culture that valued winning football games above protecting children from rape			0
and when my son was accepted to @entity20 that year , we tossed the acceptance letter in the trash			1
my own @entity20 sweatshirt was stuffed deep in the back of the closet			1
i am a @entity49 and i was ashamed			0
sadly , my new - found pride was short - lived			0
in an attempt to restore the university 's reputation , @entity52 state officials led by senate majority leader @entity56 and state treasurer @entity57 , filed a suit against the @entity59			1
they wanted all sanctions the @entity59 placed against the school be lifted			1
the @entity59 had reached beyond its authority in punishing @entity20 , they argued			1
in other words , their lawsuit had nothing to do with the boys who were raped or abused by @entity28			0
it had nothing to do with the fact that head football coach @entity72 , who died in 2012 , and others at the school had been alerted to this abuse as early as 1998 and did very little to make sure it stopped			1
nope , @entity56 and others wanted redemption for @entity20 , based on a loophole over the authority of the @entity59 to punish the football program			1
the @entity59 caved , ruling last week to restore @entity20 's 112 wins wiped out during the @entity28 scandal , including the 111 wins erased from the record of head football coach @entity72 -- all the victories after the first time police were called by a mother reporting that @entity28 had showered with her 10 - year - old son on the @entity20 campus back in 1998			1
and the $ 60 million dollar fine the @entity59 levied against the school ? well , now instead of the @entity59 collecting the fine and spending the dollars nationally , the ruling allows the university to keep the money but commit to spending the $ 60 million in @entity52 to fund in - state child abuse programs only			1
other sanctions lifted by the @entity59 ruling , include ending a five - year probation period and scholarship and transfer rules			1
we teach our kids when they do wrong to face up to it , take their punishment without complaint or excuses and move on			0
then , go out into the world and show everyone you are better than your lowest moments			0
it takes courage , integrity and leadership			0
that is what @entity20 needed to do			1
and so , for me , this is not a proud day for @entity20			1
we 've cheated the system , bullied our way back into the record books			0
and we 've told the world once again that in @entity124 winning is more important than anything			0
all those boys who were raped ? well , that 's not our problem			2
what 's important is making sure coach @entity72 's 409 - 136 - 3 is restored			1
" the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth , " said mister @entity130 , a @entity20 alum , and track coach for more than 11 years			1
" the @entity59 sanctions athletes for the smallest things -- you take a parent to lunch , it 's a violation			1
you help a student - athlete pay for airfare for their parent to see a game , it 's a violation			2
students lose eligibility , sports programs are punished			0
and now , the @entity59 is lifting sanctions after boys were molested and raped on his watch and he did little or nothing to stop it			1
this sends a terrible message , " said @entity130 , who was the first person in his family to graduate from college			0
this weekend , social media is abuzz with @entity20 fans applauding the @entity59 decision , feeling vindicated			1
for many others , me included , this ruling and the reaction from the @entity166 wipes away any bonhomie the university was gaining over the past three years			2
" it is hard to believe that the @entity59 and the school could take the most nauseating , the most horrifying , the most indefensible institutionalization of corruption in @entity176 sports -- the @entity177 -- and make it worse , but today they just did , " said @entity180 's @entity179 said on his show friday			1
it seemed that the university was trying to clean up its act			2
@entity72 and university president @entity186 had been fired			1
both of those things needed to happen			0
the board of trustees had ushered in changes			0
the @entity28 trial ended after months of testimony almost too unbearable to watch as abuse victim after abuse victim told their painful stories about being raped and molested by @entity28			0
a new coach was brought in and the team started winning			0
that 's how healing happens ; how forgiveness happens			2
one day at a time , trying to do better , be better than you were yesterday			0
there is no short cut on the road to redemption			0
even coach @entity72 knew that : " success without honor is an unseasoned dish ; it will satisfy your hunger , but it wo n't taste good			1
" -- @entity72 @entity72 may be back atop the record books as the " winningest coach ever , " but he was not an honorable man -- not when it came to putting the lives and safety of children above football			2
and no @entity59 ruling can change that history .			2

@entity223 : @entity59 *agreed* to restore @entity20 's wins under @entity72
she says *settlement* shows that university and its supporters still have n't accepted *responsibility* for scandal
