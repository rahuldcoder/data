police have not disclosed the race of the officer who shot @entity6			1
" this is not a black and white issue			0
this is a right and wrong issue , " attorney @entity50 said			0

you did n't give him a chance			1
you just killed him , " one man told @entity134 affiliate @entity168			0
someone claiming to represent the online activist group @entity171 claimed in a @entity173 video to have taken down the city 's website , blaming the shooting on what the speaker said was " an overzealous rookie officer " who resorted too quickly to lethal force			1
" officers are equipped with many nonlethal options such as @entity186 guns , " the speaker said			0
" why did he not use a taser on this child ? shooting him in cold blood was not necessary with these nonlethal options available			0
" however , @entity130 said officers had no way to know the air gun was n't a real firearm			1
" you feel bad , after the fact , that it was a 12 - year - old , " he said			0
" nobody wants to shoot a 12 - year - old , especially when they are holding a fake gun			1
but that 's not the perception the officers had at that time			0
