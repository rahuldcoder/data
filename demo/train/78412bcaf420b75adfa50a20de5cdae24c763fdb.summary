-- nothing less than the @entity3 's reputation is on the line , and possibly the job of the league 's commissioner , @entity6			1
a bombshell video shows @entity9 knocking out his now - wife on a casino elevator			1
another shows him dragging her off			0
what we do n't know for certain is what the @entity3 knew about the incident and when the league knew it			1
some want @entity6 's head			0
the @entity3 announced late wednesday that former fbi director @entity25 will lead an independent inquiry into the league 's investigation and how it gathered evidence in the case			1
@entity25 will have access to all @entity3 records , according to league spokesman @entity33			1
two @entity3 owners who are attorneys -- @entity35 of the @entity36 and @entity37 of the @entity38 -- will oversee the independent investigation			1
@entity25 was director of the @entity40 from 2001 to 2013			2
appointment not enough if the league was looking to stem the tide of criticism , it did n't work			0
the @entity45 called @entity25 's appointment " just window dressing , " saying it does n't go far enough			1
" now continues to ask for @entity6 to resign , and for his successor to appoint an independent investigator with full authority to gather factual data about domestic violence , dating violence , sexual assault and stalking within the entire @entity3 community -- not just regarding the @entity9 incident -- and to recommend real and lasting reforms , " said @entity48 , president of the @entity45			1
@entity9 , who was released monday by the @entity60 , and his then - fiancee , @entity61 , got into an altercation on an elevator in the casino in @entity65 on february 15			1
@entity9 knocked her out with a punch to the head then dragged her -- face down -- out of the elevator			1
@entity69 obtained two videos from the footage taken from surveillance cameras that night			0
it posted the first one , which showed @entity9 dragging his then - fiancee out of the elevator , in february			1
the in - elevator video showing the violent punch was put online monday			1
@entity6 told @entity79 that what he saw on the second video was " inconsistent " with what @entity9 told him when he and his wife met with the commissioner in june to explain what happened			1
several other people attended the meeting , including representatives from the players ' union , executives from the @entity60 and lawyers for the @entity3			2
but on thursday , @entity93 reported that four sources -- none of whom were named -- said that @entity9 told @entity6 he had punched @entity61			1
a fifth source said @entity9 described the hit as a slap			2
@entity93 reported the five sources had knowledge of the meeting			1
@entity103 said : " he told the truth			0
this is a public lynching of @entity9			2
" a friend of @entity9 told @entity0 's " outfront with @entity107 " that @entity9 has n't hidden from the ugly truth			2
" he told everyone that asked , that was in a position of authority -- from the @entity3 to his bosses with the @entity60 -- what he did , " said @entity115 , who is a radio co-host with former @entity3 quarterback @entity117			2
" he took ownership of the despicable act and has tried to make it right			0
" @entity6 : @entity3 could n't legally get @entity9 videos @entity60 owner looks back it was that second video that changed @entity60 owner @entity126 's perception of the incident			1
@entity126 , who told @entity0 affiliate @entity128 that he never spoke with @entity9 , said he did n't realize the blow that knocked @entity130 out was so forceful			2
" the way it was described to us was that he had hit her with an open hand and that she had hit her head ( as she fell ) , " @entity126 told @entity128			0
he told the station that the way he pictured it in his mind @entity130 was " wailing " on her then - fiance when he slapped her and she was close to the wall and hit her head , knocking her out			0
" so why did i conclude all of that ? because i wanted to , because i loved him , because he had a stellar record , " @entity126 said			0
he added his thinking was also shaped by the fact that police only arrested the couple for misdemeanors			0
@entity9 's charge was later changed to a felony , and @entity61 's charge was dropped			2
@entity3 and the video the @entity3 on wednesday said it is looking into an @entity156 report that a league executive in april received from a law enforcement official a copy of the video in which @entity9 punched his now - wife in the face			1
the law enforcement official had a short voice mail from april 9 in which someone calling from a number at an @entity3 office thanks the official , the @entity156 reported			1
the caller says of the video , " you 're right			0
it 's terrible , " according to the @entity156 the league has denied that anyone in its office had seen the video before monday , when it was posted online			2
the @entity156 story said the law enforcement official requested anonymity because of an ongoing investigation and did n't name the @entity3 executive because that would make it easy to identify the @entity156 's source			1
the source told @entity156 he sent the video on a dvd to an @entity3 office			1
" the person said he was unauthorized to release the video but shared it unsolicited , because he wanted the @entity3 to have it before deciding on @entity9 's punishment , " the @entity156 wrote			1
' this is a huge problem ' @entity3 commissioner @entity6 told @entity79 in an interview aired wednesday that the league asked for the video on several occasions , but was denied access			2
" i understand that there may be legal restrictions on them sharing that with us , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity201 said the @entity156 report , if true , is extremely damaging to the @entity3 's and @entity6 's reputation			1
" this is a huge problem , and not just for the public , " she said			0
" @entity6 is either flat - out lying about having seen the video , or he is admitting to gross , gross negligence that this was in his office and he did n't see the video			2
" in a memo to @entity3 owners , the commissioner reiterated that position , saying the @entity3 asked for the videos in february and in may			0
@entity217 law prohibits their release while a police investigation is under way , @entity6 wrote in the memo			0
the league did n't ask a casino in @entity65 , @entity217 , for the video , @entity6 said			0
opinion : @entity3 and abuse -- it 's not just @entity9 ' it was sickening ' @entity9 was suspended indefinitely by the league and is in a pretrial intervention program in the @entity217 legal system that will allow him to avoid jail time			1
initially he had been suspended for two games of the 16 - game season , a decision by @entity6 that was widely criticized			0
many commentators have argued the first video @entity69 posted was evidence enough for a harsher penalty			0
but there was a complaint summons that @entity3 investigators should have had access to as well			0
the @entity243 posted part of the document back in february			0
the complaint says @entity9 was charged with assault by attempting to cause bodily harm , " specifically by striking her with his hand , rendering her unconscious			0
" @entity6 told @entity79 that he was sickened by what he saw on the newly released video and that it was the first time he had seen the full scope of the february incident			0
he also deflected criticism of his handling of @entity9 's case and his initial lenient penalty for the domestic violence incident			2
" what we saw in the first videotape was troubling to us in and of itself , " @entity6 said , referring to another video that surfaced in february after the incident , showing @entity9 dragging his then - fiancee out of the elevator			1
" but what we saw yesterday was extremely clear			0
it was extremely graphic and it was sickening			0
" a timeline of key events @entity3 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story ' @entity0 's @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 contributed to this report .			0
