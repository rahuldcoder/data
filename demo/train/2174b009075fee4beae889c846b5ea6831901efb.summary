-- about a year after losing his dad in a plane crash , @entity1 climbed into the cockpit for an emotional flight			2
his kids @entity7 , age 5 and @entity9 , 3 , were tucked in the back of the tiny @entity11 and his flight instructor was seated alongside			2
@entity1 pulled back on the stick and they were airborne			2
the @entity16 , @entity17 , landscape spread out below them as the plane gained altitude			2
@entity1 could n't help but gaze down at @entity21 , where @entity22 crashed during takeoff , killing his father , @entity25 , and 48 others			2
a government investigation blamed the crash on flight 191 's pilots , who attempted takeoff from a wrong runway			2
the @entity34 administrator at the time said disasters like flight 191 might be avoided under @entity38 , the nation 's sweeping air traffic overhaul set to roll out by 2025			1
memories of the crash had kept @entity1 -- a longtime private pilot -- out of the cockpit until his wife offered the flight as a gift for @entity47			2
" she wanted me to take the kids up and to see if i wanted to keep flying			2
" @entity1 and his father shared a love for flying -- @entity1 as a pilot and his dad as a passenger			2
@entity25 enjoyed flying so much he 'd been talking about getting his pilots ' license , too			0
@entity25 , a 51 - year - old accountant and consultant for legal cases , was a frequent business traveler who left his @entity16 home many times a year to spend a total of six months away at his offices in @entity63 , @entity64 , and near @entity65 , @entity66			1
@entity1 , an it consultant , had set up shop with his dad in the same @entity16 building , where their father - son relationship strengthened			1
everything changed on the dreary sunday morning of august 27 , 2006			0
@entity1 was home with his wife and kids when a friend called			0
" she said , ' @entity1 your dad was on that airplane			0
' i said , ' what airplane ? ' and she goes , ' turn on the news , ' and sure enough there was the crash			0
" @entity1 's first thought was : " there 's no way he was on that plane			0
why would he be flying out on a sunday ? " but the friend who called knew his father had changed his departure date			0
" so i immediately called my dad 's cell and it went straight to voice mail and i left a message saying , ' @entity98 , just give me a call			0
i 'm just checking on you			0
' " @entity1 was n't sure if he really wanted to get back in the cockpit so soon after the crash , but he found himself doing so -- creating a kind of emotional test to gauge his loss and how it had transformed him			0
it was likely he might choose never to fly again			0
and that feeling became stronger during the flight			0
he realized his love of flying , which he 'd cherished since his teens , had suddenly disappeared			0
" something was different and i just did n't feel comfortable doing it anymore , " @entity1 said			0
" the flight was my way of saying , ' ok that 's it , farewell			0
we 've had some good times but now it 's time to move on			0
' " if planes are outfitted with cockpit displays pinpointing their locations on airport surface maps , crashes like @entity22 might be prevented , then - @entity34 administrator @entity124 told @entity127 's @entity126 newspaper			1
a map display could have alerted crew members they were on the wrong runway , say experts			0
with @entity38 technology , the lone controller on duty that morning also might have had access to a similar map display , which experts say also may have helped avert the crash			1
experts throughout the industry agree the @entity141 enjoys the world 's safest air traffic system , with no deaths from commercial airline crashes last year			1
but @entity38 aims to head off future safety concerns from gridlock expected as the skies and airports become more crowded			1
as many as 6,000 aircraft are in the skies during peak traffic times , according to the @entity34			1
but get ready for that number to increase			0
the number of annual @entity141 air passengers is projected to pass 1 billion by 2021			1
radar -- the technology that currently tracks all flights -- dates back to the early 20th century			1
it 's less accurate than @entity160 , its data is delayed by about 10 seconds and pilots ca n't use it to see their positions on a cockpit display			1
@entity38 's gps - based technology promises to increase safety by allowing pilots to see their locations and locations of surrounding aircraft via a cockpit display in real time			1
how @entity38 affects travelers this visual aide vastly improves what pilots call situation awareness , a mental picture of where their aircraft is in relation to its surroundings			1
any kind of technology that provides pilots with more information is a good thing , said @entity1 , who believes better situation awareness in the cockpit might have saved his father 's life			1
a gps - based tracking technology called @entity189 ( automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast ) is already used to some extent by @entity192 , @entity193 , and soon , @entity194			1
by 2020 , the @entity34 will require all @entity141 aircraft to broadcast their positions using @entity189 - @entity196 more about @entity189 in smaller general aviation aircraft , @entity189 has proved its value for @entity199			1
the pilot instructor at @entity201 in @entity202 , @entity66 , credits @entity189 with saving her life and the life of her co-pilot in 2007			0
during a cross-country air race over @entity208 , another plane was bearing down from behind and above @entity210 's aircraft -- a blind spot where eyesight alone would have left her unaware			2
the approaching plane triggered a warning from the @entity189 -- and @entity210 took action			0
" if we would n't have sidestepped to the right , they would have just landed right on top of our airplane , " she said			0
national security big questions remain unanswered surrounding @entity38 and the security of the nation 's airspace			1
on 9/11 , terrorist hijackers shut off radar transponders aboard their hijacked airliners , making it hard to identify and track them en route to their targets			2
without transponders , planes are visible on radar screens , but impossible to @entity237			2
would hijackers be able to do the same thing with @entity189 ? it 's unclear how vulnerable the ads - b system would be to hackers , terrorists and other attackers compared with the nation 's current radar - based tracking			1
in a 9/11 scenario , if both a plane 's @entity189 and its radar transponder are shut off , experts say the plane would be harder to track but still visible on radar , which would be available as an @entity189 backup			2
the @entity34 refused to discuss details about ads - b and security issues , but a spokesman said protections are part of the program and are being developed			1
" that 's the reality of today 's environment , that we have to take all these things into account , which we are , " said @entity34 spokesman @entity260			1
for example , testing is under way in the @entity193 on ways to prevent hackers from " spoofing , " which involves intentionally interfering with @entity189 signals to create false targets on @entity189 displays			1
the @entity34 plans to decommission some radar stations as it relies more on @entity189 by 2020 , will there still be enough radar stations to protect @entity141 airspace ? in february , the @entity281 inspector general warned about potential gaps in the system			1
top @entity141 security authorities , @entity285 and the @entity286 , have n't yet agreed with the @entity34 on how to jointly monitor so - called " noncooperative " aircraft , in other words aircraft possibly piloted by terrorists that are n't transmitting flight information			1
" without closer coordination and agreement about surveillance requirements , there is potential for duplicative efforts and gaps in airspace coverage , " @entity281 inspector general @entity293 told a @entity295 panel			1
the situation is enough to prompt concern among members of the powerful @entity305 , which has a big say in @entity38 funding			1
as the fifth anniversary of the @entity16 crash approaches , @entity1 does n't miss being in the cockpit as much as he thought he would			0
he 's still healing from the disaster 's emotional scars , and he still prefers to drive -- if possible -- rather than fly commercial			0
" it 's difficult for some people to give up that control , " @entity1 said , " especially when they 've been through something like i 've been through -- and the rest of my family and the families of the 48 other people on the plane			0
" he 'll mark the fifth anniversary of the crash in a ceremony at the @entity17 arboretum , where he will help unveil a 25 - foot memorial statue depicting 49 silver birds forever suspended in flight			2
years ago @entity1 said farewell to piloting an aircraft ever again , but lately he does n't rule it out -- someday			0
" maybe , " he said			0
it 's just going to take time			0
" this is the final report of a three - part series surrounding the @entity34 's " @entity38 " overhaul of the @entity141 air traffic system			1
previous parts discussed @entity38 technology and how the program will affect consumers			1
@entity0 's @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343 contributed to this report .			0

@entity38 @entity141 air traffic overhaul aims to improve safety with new technology
@entity34 is switching from radar tracking to more accurate gps tracking
steps being taken to protect @entity160 - based tracking from " spoofing " hackers
@entity281 warns about security gaps unless authorities coordinate on tracking coverage
