@entity0 -- @entity2 admitted thursday there had been a " cover - up " of phone hacking at his flagship @entity7 tabloid newspaper and apologized for not paying more attention to a scandal that has convulsed his media empire and rocked the @entity7 political establishment			1
and he said that he had shut down the best - selling @entity14 out of " panic " in the face of public fury about the revelation that a murdered teenage girl had been a victim of phone hacking			1
@entity2 , who owns the @entity21 and the @entity22 in @entity0 , as well as controlling the @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , said his @entity26 had been a victim of the cover - up , not the perpetrator			1
" someone took charge of a cover - up , which we were victim to and i regret , " he said at the @entity30 , an independent @entity7 probe prompted by charges of illegal eavesdropping by his newspaper			1
he blamed " one or two very strong individuals " at the paper , but did not name them			0
" i also have to say that i failed , " he said of the fact that he did not pay enough attention to the problem of phone hacking			1
he then paused a long time before finally continuing : " and i am very sorry for it			0
" if he had known the depth of the problem in 2007 , when a private investigator and a @entity2 journalist were sent to prison for phone hacking , he " would have torn the place apart and we would n't be here today			1
but that 's hindsight , " he said			0
the hacking scandal has led to dozens of arrests , two parliamentary investigations and the @entity30 , a judge - led independent probe set up by the @entity7 government			1
@entity2 suggested key parts of the scandal have been overblown			1
" the hacking scandal was not a great national thing until the @entity68 disclosure , half of which has been somewhat disowned by the police , " @entity2 said			1
he was referring to the revelation that people working for him had hacked into the voice mail of a missing 13 - year - old who later turned out to have been murdered			2
the @entity75 newspaper originally reported that the hackers had also deleted some of her voice mails , leading to false hopes that she was still alive and deleting them herself			0
in fact , the messages may have expired automatically			0
@entity84 described the atmosphere when news of the @entity68 hacking became public in july 2011			0
" you could feel the blast coming in the window			0
i can say it succinctly			0
and i am sorry i did , " he said of his decision to close the tabloid			0
he later said he should have closed it years earlier			0
" this whole business is a serious blot on my reputation , " he said			2
@entity2 was also grilled over his media empire 's back - channel lobbying of the @entity7 government , and said he learned of the existence of one of the key lobbyists only " a few months ago			1
" @entity2 said he was " surprised " at the extent of the contact by the employee , @entity112 , with the @entity7 government as it considered a bid by @entity26 to take full ownership of @entity109			2
that bid that collapsed because of the phone - hacking scandal			1
" you call it lobbying , i call it seeking of information , " @entity2 told the @entity30			2
" i did n't see anything wrong with his activities			0
i was i surprised that it had gone on so long , that there were so many e-mails , yes			0
" a government aide quit wednesday over the revelation of the extent of the contacts , and there have been calls for the resignation of culture secretary @entity130 , who is named in the correspondence			0
@entity2 spent hours wednesday downplaying his political influence , even as @entity7 prime minister @entity133 said politicians had been too close to @entity2 over the years and the government aide , @entity135 , resigned over communications between the culture ministry and @entity26 @entity2 insisted wednesday that he had " never asked a prime minister for anything " as he chronicled his personal relationships with prime ministers going back to @entity142 in the early 1980s			2
the media baron also denied using the power of his press for personal gain			1
at the same time , @entity133 was saying politicians from across the political spectrum had been too close to @entity2			2
" i think we all , on both sides of this house , did a bit too much cozying up to mr. @entity2 , " he told the @entity149 as his government was battered over testimony @entity2 's son had given to the @entity30 the day before			2
@entity157 testified tuesday that before @entity133 became prime minister , he had met the politician over drinks at a pub and told him the company 's @entity21 newspaper would support his conservative party in the next election			0
the younger @entity2 insisted that he knew little about the scale of phone hacking by people working for the @entity14 , as he continued his fight to limit the damage the scandal does to him and his family 's media empire			1
the scandal has forced @entity26 to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking			1
@entity157 and @entity2 have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them			1
they have always denied knowing about the scale of the practice , which police say could have affected thousands of people , ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans			0
@entity1 's @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0

the media baron says he closed the tabloid out of " panic "
