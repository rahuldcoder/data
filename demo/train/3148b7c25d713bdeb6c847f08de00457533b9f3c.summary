-- @entity1 bestrode the sport of cycling like a colossus between 1999 and 2005			1
his feat of winning seven consecutive titles at the @entity7 -- arguably the world 's toughest sporting event -- was like the demigod @entity10 completing his " twelve labors			1
" @entity1 's achievements seemed all the more extraordinary given his against - the - odds recovery after being diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1996			1
his best - selling autobiography " it 's not about the bike : my @entity29 " in 2000 helped give birth to the @entity1 legend , as it recounted his fight for life against a disease that had spread to his lungs , abdomen and brain before he underwent radical treatment and went on to win his first tour in 1999			1
this was a sporting story that gave hope to millions across the world			0

" @entity92 also recounted buying makeup for @entity1 to conceal what she said he described as bruise from a syringe injection during a race			0
while @entity92 said she never saw @entity1 use banned substances -- though she felt sure that he did -- @entity154 had a different story , saying " the first time i ever blood - doped was with @entity1 " and that his teammate was well aware and involved with everything that happened			0
the publication of " @entity82 " led to a raft of lawsuits			0
@entity1 sued @entity163 newspaper @entity164 , which published an article referencing the book , before eventually reaching an out - of - court settlement			0

@entity195 launched legal action against @entity1 in the form of a whistleblower suit , claiming he had defrauded the @entity68 government by accepting money from the @entity93			1
@entity1 remained staunch in his denial of doping allegations , but former colleagues such as @entity154 continued to make claims of wrongdoing			0
the @entity68 , who has since been stripped of the gold medal he won at the @entity213 , admitted to doping while also pointing the finger at @entity1			1
