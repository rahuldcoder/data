-- free elections 20 years ago this week in @entity2 marked the unraveling of the @entity5 bloc of @entity7 nations and the beginning of market reforms			1
shipyard workers hold @entity12 trade union flags on the anniversary of free elections in @entity2			2
the events of june 1989 also marked the turning point for companies like @entity18 , which has grown into a global player in the world 's copper market and one of @entity2 's largest companies with 18,000 employees			1
" a lot of changes have happened since that moment , since 1989 , " said @entity25 , a development engineer who has worked at a company copper smelter near @entity27 for more than 30 years			2
" this is the @entity2 of my dreams , " @entity25 said			2
" even though i will probably retire in the next few months i feel so fortunate to have seen the last 20 years in my professional career			2
" the financial crisis has had minimal impact on the company so far			0
" in comparison to other sectors of the @entity2 economy , the commodity business has been doing quite well , " said @entity36 , sales director of @entity18			1
@entity2 's export prowess has led the nation to become one of the great success stories of former communist bloc economies			1
in 2008 , it ranked 22nd in the world with more than $ 190 billion in exports , ahead of @entity49 and @entity50 , according to the @entity51			1
the country 's economy has grown every year since 1992 , and bucked the recessionary trend of other @entity56 nations by expanding its economy by just under 1 percent in the first quarter of this year			1
" @entity2 is not an island and we are very much linked to other @entity56 countries so a lot depends on the performance of the @entity66 economy , " said @entity59 , @entity2 's deputy finance minister			1
" but even with the current forecasts which are really pessimistic for the @entity66 economy , we still think @entity2 should be doing relatively ok			1
" @entity68 was the country 's first finance minister after the fall of communism and initiated @entity2 's free market reforms			1
" socialism ( was ) a very bad system and everybody knew that it was a bad system without any hope for a better life , " he said			0
" transition to a better system is sometimes difficult but you have to overcome these difficulties on the way to a better regime			0
" one industry that exploded was @entity2 's once state - run media industry , which now includes eight daily national newspapers plus dozens of television channels and radio stations			1
" the transformation had many phases in @entity2			2
the state totally withdrew from the press market and step - by - step , private tv stations appeared , " said @entity2 journalist @entity90			2
" so , today we have a pluralist media which represents very different tendencies			0
" @entity98 and @entity99 founded the @entity100 , a leading private media company in @entity2 with television stations - including the influential news network @entity102 - as well as a home video , new media and theatrical production operations			1
" under one umbrella there 's various projects put together , " @entity98 said			0
" the advantage it gives us is the free flow of content and information between all the platforms			0
" communism and absolute media control may have only been twenty years ago - but in @entity2 today , certainly for the country 's youth and the media , it 's a lifetime			1
@entity122 set up " @entity124 " - @entity2 's equivalent to @entity126 -- with three friends in 2006			1
its success made 25 - year - old @entity122 one of @entity2 's youngest millionaires			1
he 's also too young to remember what life was like under @entity117			0
" i 'm very glad that i live in these times because we have so many more opportunities than our older friends so for example , you could n't manage your own business twenty years ago , now there is an opportunity to do that , " @entity122 said			1
" so you can develop your ideas , create your own firms			0
" but market reforms have n't been kind to the historic shipyards of @entity148 , where the @entity150 movement began with union leader and future @entity2 president , @entity152			1
marching with him was @entity154 , a shipyard worker for more than 30 years who spent nearly a year in jail for civil disobedience for his role in the union			2
in the 20 years since the end of communism , he 's seen the shipyard workforce shrink from 18,000 to about 2,700 today			2
the shipyard , in danger of going bankrupt , was given a lifeline this week when @entity165 , @entity166 , met with @entity2 officials and told the press an @entity56 bailout of the shipyard was likely			2
still , @entity154 said " shipyard workers do n't have much reason to be happy			0
over the past 20 years we have been trying to save our jobs			0
" while the fortune of his nation improved , he still lives in the same tiny apartment as he did in 1989 and has the same worries about his job			0
but @entity154 says it was all worth the fight			0
" of course it 's much better			0
in the old days all you could get at the shop was vinegar and mustard			0
to get anything else you had to know people			0
now everything is available , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
