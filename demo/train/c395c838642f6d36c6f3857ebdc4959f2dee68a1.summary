-- " what kind of coffee do you have ? " " well , black , or with milk , " comes the grumpy reply			2
this is the delightfully retro @entity7 bar , where the interior and the grumpiness of the service have n't changed for 50 years			1
nor has the coffee -- a drink that 's always played a central role in @entity15 life			1
through the communist years those shots of dark , bitter coffee in small glasses , served by scowling waitresses , were a staple start to the day			1
while coffee 's importance has n't changed , a new wave of coffee bars -- where competitive baristas know their ristretto from their cortado -- is shaking up the scene			2
the buzz word is " kezmuves " -- it roughly translates as handmade , or craft			0
there are three keys to the new craft coffee bars -- talented staff ( with the certificates to prove it ) , slick design and carefully chosen ingredients			2
the coffee is sometimes described locally as " third wave , " meaning it 's fairly sourced and roasted on a smaller scale , giving it a lighter , less bitter taste than @entity47 beans			1
" in new wave coffee you discover the real qualities of the coffee beans , like the fruity , citric qualities of @entity57 beans or the chocolate of @entity60 beans , " says @entity48 , manager of the @entity50 craft coffee bar			1
despite the interest in new wave , both old - and new - style coffee houses compete to deliver @entity15 its caffeine kicks			1
here are some of the best : new wave coffee @entity50 @entity68 philosopher @entity67 , whose childhood name was @entity50 , must have loved his coffee			1
inspired by his calmness , the friendly , capped baristas here earnestly go about their work , explaining the different beans and roasts available and serving beautifully presented cups			0
they also bake their own sweet and savory croissants			0
@entity50 , 3 @entity79 ; +36 1 796 6287 @entity80 this is one of the largest and best designed craft coffee bars -- it 's staffed by an array of award - winning baristas			1
the brick - vaulted interior was done by the firm that designed two of the stations on the city 's new metro line			1
an excellent cake selection includes croissants , cheesecakes and brownies			0
@entity80 , 15 @entity96 ; + 36 30 864 9530 my little @entity97 pioneer of the craft coffee movement , this minute coffee bar in the center of town is a busy breakfast place			1
inspired by the @entity107 travels of owners @entity108 and @entity110 , it serves some of @entity15 's best coffee and pastries			1
my little @entity97 , 3 , @entity113 ; +36 70 394 7002 @entity114 this one 's even smaller than my @entity97 , but aficionados speak of @entity117 with great respect			0
with a couple of tables on the pavement in front , @entity114 ( meaning " black " in @entity124 ) is all about coffee , and very little else			0
@entity114 , 5 @entity125 korut @entity126 this is the smaller of the @entity129 shops , but it 's the most central , down the road from the @entity132			2
the name refers to two moves in the barista 's work -- tamp and pull -- which they do so well here they run courses on the art of coffee			1
a board on the wall details the beans on offer each day -- where they were grown , who farmed them and at what altitude			0
@entity126 , 3 czuczor st. ; + 36 30 668 3051 old wave coffee @entity149 breakfast is the best time to visit @entity149 , a quietly hip square in the heart of @entity15			1
it 's often buzzing with the local students enjoying the superb coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice			2
@entity149 has its own roasting machine , offering customers a choice of beans and coffee type			0
@entity149 , 2 @entity163 ter ; +36 1 317 4209 @entity164 at this large cafe / restaurant in the heart of @entity15 's partying @entity168 , the baristas roast their own beans			1
the coffee is superb , and so is the food -- after all those small coffee bars , you 'll enjoy the space			0
@entity164 , 25 dob st. ; +36 1 786 4959 @entity175 there 's no craft coffee here , but the baristas in this busy breakfast joint know how to make an excellent brew			1
there 's also a great selection of baguettes , with fillings such as caponata , roasted squash or chicken salad , from the sandwich specialists at the @entity190			0
@entity175 , 44 o st. ; +36 1 708 0170 @entity191 @entity192 , or " socks , " is n't the obvious name for a cafe , particularly one placed across the road from one of @entity15 's big tourist draws -- the magnificent @entity199			1
it was the owner 's nickname in his taxi driving days			0
more importantly , the baristas turn out top coffee and the cakes are delicious			0
@entity206 , 1/b @entity207 ; +36 1 785 6765 @entity7 finally , across the @entity208 to old @entity15 , to the glorious @entity7			1
no fancy baristas , either			0
the retro feel has n't been put together in a design studio -- it 's always looked this way			0
it 's one of the great survivors of the past			0
here you can enjoy a strong black coffee in an old - style glass , sit on red plastic seats and watch old men playing cards			2
just do n't ask for a cortado			0
