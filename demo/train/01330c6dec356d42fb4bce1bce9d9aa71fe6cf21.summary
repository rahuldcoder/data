" @entity1 " vision could be redefined by gadgets that give you the eyes of a cyborg			0
the surface of the eye can be used to measure much of the same data you would get from blood tests			1
the tech industry calls the digital enrichment of the physical world " augmented reality			0
" such technology is already appearing in smartphones and toys , and enthusiasts dream of a pair of glasses we could don to enhance our everyday perception			0
but why stop there ? scientists , eye surgeons , professors and students at the @entity28 have been developing a contact lens containing one built - in @entity31 , powered wirelessly with radio frequency waves			1
eventually , more advanced versions of the lens could be used to provide a wealth of information , such as virtual captions scrolling beneath every person or object you see			1
significantly , it could also be used to monitor your own vital signs , such as body temperature and blood glucose level			0
why a contact lens ? the surface of the eye contains enough data about the body to perform personal health monitoring , according to @entity51 , a @entity28 professor of bionanotechnology , who is working on the project			1
" the eye is our little door into the body , " @entity51 told @entity55			2
with gadgets becoming increasingly mobile and powerful , the technology industry is seeing a steady stream of applications devoted to health			2
a few examples include a cellphone microscope used to diagnose malaria , surgeons honing their skills with the @entity69 , and an @entity71 app made for diabetes patients to track their glucose levels			0
a contact lens with augmented - reality powers would take personal health monitoring several steps further , @entity51 said , because the surface of the eye can be used to measure much of the data you would read from your blood tests , including cholesterol , sodium , potassium and glucose levels			1
and that 's just the beginning			0
because this sort of real - time health monitoring has been impossible in the past , there 's likely more about the human eye we have n't yet discovered , @entity51 said			1
and beyond personal health monitoring , this finger - tip sized gadget could one day create a new interface for gaming , social networking and , well , interacting with reality in general			1
@entity51 and his colleagues have been working on their multipurpose lens since 2004			2
they integrated miniature antennas , control circuits , an led and radio chips into the lens using optoelectronic components they built from scratch			1
they hope these components will eventually include hundreds of @entity31 to display images in front of the eye			0
think words , charts and even photographs			0
sounds neat , does n't it ? but the group faces a number of challenges before achieving true augmented eye vision			0
first and foremost , safety is a prime concern with a device that comes in contact with the eye			2
to ensure the lens is safe to wear , the group has been testing prototypes on live rabbits , who have successfully worn the lenses for 20 minutes at a time with no adverse effects			2
however , the lens must undergo much more testing before gaining approval from the @entity138			1
a fundamental challenge this contact lens will face is the task of tracking the human eye , said @entity143 , an associate professor and director of the augmented environments lab at @entity146			1
@entity143 is not involved in the contact lens product , but he helped develop an augmented - reality zombie shooter game			1
" these developments are obviously very far from being usable , but very exciting , " @entity143 said			0
" using them for @entity151 will be very hard			0
you need to know exactly where the user is looking if you want to render graphics that line up with the world , especially when their eyes saccade ( jump around ) , which our eyes do at a very high rate			0
" given that obstacle , we 're more likely to see wearable augmented - reality eyeware in the form of glasses before a contact lens , @entity143 said			1
with glasses , we 'll only need to track where the glasses are and where the eyes are relative to them as opposed to where the eyes are actually looking			0
and with a contact lens , it will be difficult to cram heavy computational power into such a small device , even with today 's state - of - the - art technologies , @entity51 admits			1
there are many advanced sensors that would amplify the lens ' abilities , but the difficulty lies in integrating them , which is why @entity51 and his colleagues have had to engineer their own components			2
and when the contact lens evolves from personal health monitoring into more processor - intense augmented - reality applications , it 's more likely it will have to draw its powers from a companion device such as a smartphone , he said			1
@entity196 , an @entity198 - based startup focusing on augmented reality , shares @entity28 's vision of an augmented - reality contact lens			1
however , @entity202 , ceo of @entity196 , said such a device 's vision would be limited if it did not work with an open platform supporting every type of data available via the web , such as mapping information , restaurant reviews or even @entity211 feeds			0
hence , his company has taken a first step by releasing an augmented - reality browser for @entity216 smartphones , for which software developers can provide " layers " of data for various web services			2
@entity221 believes a consumer - oriented , multipurpose lens is just one example of where augmented - reality technology will take form in the near future			2
he said to expect these applications to move beyond augmenting vision and expand to other parts of the body			0
" imagine audio cues through an earpiece or sneakers vibrating wherever your friends are , " van der @entity202 said			0
" we need to keep an open eye for future possibilities , and i think a contact lens is just part of it			1
