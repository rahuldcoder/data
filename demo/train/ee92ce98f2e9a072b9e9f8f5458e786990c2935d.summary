-- dreaming of a white @entity1 ? then you 're in for a rude awakening			0
the only thing white about this riotously multiethnic black comedy is the blizzard of cocaine that flies through the air as @entity9 croons his yuletide standard at an out of control @entity12 party			0
if i said the latest sortie from cultural subversives @entity15 ( @entity16 ) and @entity17 ( @entity18 ) has something to offend everyone , i 'd probably be over-estimating the sensitivities of at least some of the 17.4 million @entity24 who are estimated to use marijuana at least once a month			1
still , i imagine that the running gag about an infant inadvertently exposed to pot , coke and ecstasy might strike some people as pretty near the knuckle			0
others will choke when the always game @entity35 -- playing himself -- explains his miraculous resurrection with reference to a run - in with @entity39 , who did n't take kindly to @entity35 making out with his groupies			0
then there are the gags -- good , bad and indifferent - that deliberately play up ethnic stereotypes : jailbird @entity45 , gangsta african - americans , tight - fisted @entity47 , bloodthirsty @entity48 , square and boring wasps			1
the subtler joke being that @entity15 and @entity17 's own ethnicity is invisible -- except to the occasional bigots they encounter			1
( " sorry , i do n't date black guys , " says the @entity54 virgin , @entity53 , as she rejects @entity17 in favor of @entity56			1
) you want a plot ? it 's set six years after the boys escaped from @entity62			1
@entity15 is now a successful @entity63 executive , married , clean and sober			1
he 's washed his hands of @entity17 , who 's still a bonafide pothead and no further along in life than he ever was			1
but the ex-best friends are reunited in a typically quixotic quest to get their hands on a 12 - foot christmas tree before @entity71 comes out			1
maybe the movie does pander to a certain slacker sexism -- but even that 's tempered by an eye - watering item when one of the boys gets stuck to an icy pole , " @entity80 " - style ( only it 's not his tongue that 's stuck )			1
that 's male bonding of an especially painful kind -- and marks the natural culmination for a buddy dynamic that 's deeply engrained in our movies , from @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity9 , @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity95 all the way to " @entity96			2
" it 's a tradition that @entity16 and @entity18 sustain with as much charm as circumstances allow			2
in a week when a @entity102 satirical magazine was firebombed for publishing an issue guest - edited by the prophet @entity104 ( or so they claimed ) , there is definitely something to be said for a movie that takes a blowtorch to political correctness and even puts a bullet in the head of old @entity112			0
by offending everyone , the theory goes , no one needs be offended			0
it 's a patchy affair , these things almost always are , but a commendably trim 90 - minute running time keeps things hopping			2
the film hits an early high with a series of inspired gags breaking the fourth wall to poke fun at its own 3d gimmickry			2
director @entity127 throws in a horrific claymation fantasy , doffs his cap at @entity130 and shoots an egg - throwing sequence as if he 's @entity132 , just because he can			0
the yolks on us , i guess			0
at regular intervals he sends clouds of pot wafting towards the audience			0
you do n't need to be an expert in smoke signals to catch the drift : lighten up , @entity24 .			0
