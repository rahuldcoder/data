if you think the more than weeklong controversy over a new book about the first couple had died down , well , you 'd be wrong			2
" @entity5 " host @entity4 joined the fray on his program monday night			1
" she seems nice , " was @entity4 's assessment of the first lady after reading " the @entity10 , " he told the book 's author , @entity13 reporter @entity11			1
" i 'm surprised at the controversy , " @entity4 said , " because the book seems to portray @entity17 as a complex yet human individual struggling with this unbelievable situation yet remaining the moral compass and center of an administration trying to find its footing			1
" later in the sit - down , @entity4 tells @entity11 " but i only read it because i thought there was crazy sh - t in there			1
" in a telephone interview with @entity33 on monday , @entity11 tried to explain the controversy : " the headlines in those [ initial reports ] did not reflect the book that i wrote , " the @entity13 ' @entity31 correspondent said			2
and @entity11 responded to criticism from one of her principal subjects			0
" the book does not call [ the first lady ] an angry black woman			1
those words are never in the book , " @entity11 said of the soundbite that set off a second round of media coverage , " nor is it insinuated			2
" " the @entity10 " has come under criticism because the president and first lady were not interviewed for the book , and because passages in the book portray @entity17 as concerned about the support and advice the president was getting from some of his top aides			1
the controversy began before @entity11 's book was even formally released			1
when some media outlets got their hands on copies of the book early , the resulting coverage focused on what political observers call " palace intrigue " -- a moment when press secretary @entity71 blew up and cursed the first lady and top @entity17 aide @entity72 , a moment when then - chief of staff @entity75 offered to resign ( an offer that the president refused at the time ) , and the first lady 's concerns about some of the president 's top aides			1
the @entity84 hit back hard			1
the book is " the author 's take , reflecting her own opinions , on a remarkably strong relationship between the president and first lady -- both of whom share an unwavering commitment to each other , and to improving the lives of @entity100 , " @entity84 associate communications director @entity94 wrote in a january 9 post on the @entity84 blog that bore the headline " gossip in @entity98			1
" @entity101 continued : " the book is about a relationship between two people whom the author has not spoken to in years			1
in fact , the author did not interview the @entity10 for the book so the emotions and private moments described in the book , though often seemingly ascribed to the president and @entity90 , reflect little more than the author 's own thoughts			1
these second - hand accounts are staples of every @entity115 in modern political history and are often exaggerated			0
" and as for parts of the book that portrayed moments of palace intrigue , the @entity84 was equally harsh			1
" and as those who have worked in this @entity115 will tell you , the scenes depicted in the book do not accurately portray how well the @entity125 work together , " @entity101 also wrote on the @entity84 blog			1
in a rare move , the first lady also personally responded to the book			1
while admitting she had not read it , @entity17 told @entity130 that she was n't surprised by moments in the book that portrayed her husband as telling his staff about her concerns			0
but the first lady rejected any suggestion that she was directly involved in the business of the @entity139 , that she was unhappy in her role as first spouse , or that there was any tension between her and any of the president 's top aides			2
" i guess it 's more interesting to imagine this conflicted situation here [ in the @entity84 ] , a strong woman , and , you know -- but that 's been an image that people have tried to paint of me since the day @entity153 announced [ his presidential bid ]			1
that i 'm some angry black woman			1
" the first lady also took issue with a distinctive storytelling choice made by @entity11 in " the @entity10 " -- the decision to give her reporting a kind of interior narrative quality that sometimes feels like you are reading a personal diary			2
" who can write about how i feel ? " the first lady asked rhetorically during the @entity130 news interview			0
" who ? what third person can tell me how i feel ? " @entity11 told @entity33 she requested an interview with the president and first lady but did n't let not getting one stop her from writing the book			2
" a really strong principle of mine is that , as a @entity13 reporter , i do n't practice access journalism , " @entity11 said " at the @entity13 we do n't enter into reporting projects saying [ for example ] , i 'm only going to write about @entity179 's years at @entity180 if he gives us an interview about it			0
" @entity11 added that she has " years of covering [ the first couple ] under my belt " and that she did previously interview the president and first lady for a november 2009 portrait of their marriage that appeared in the @entity188			0
@entity11 , who said she interviewed more than 200 people for the book , including current and former aides in the @entity17 @entity84 , top @entity17 advisers , and close friends of the first couple , also said that her reporting process confirmed for her that she was learning information about the @entity10 that had not been reported before			1
" i worked to get an interview with [ the president and first lady ] up until the day the book went to the printer			2
and i felt that was what -- you know , that 's my job			0
but i also felt that the stories that were coming from staff and aides were fresh , revealing stories that told as much or more as an interview might have			0
" and as for the book 's tone , the @entity13 -- @entity11 's own newspaper -- took issue with her storytelling style			2
" cue the groans , " reads the @entity13 ' review of " the @entity10 " after conveying a particularly diary - like moment in the book , " what kind of journalist presumes to know @entity17 's mind ? " the review asks before quickly pivoting to declare that " in lesser hands ' @entity222 ' would be an act of astonishing overreach but ms. @entity11 [ through years of covering the @entity10 ] has earned the voice of authority			2
" @entity11 told @entity33 the book 's style resulted from how she approached interviewing people close to the @entity10			2
" what i did do is really push in interviews to get friends and aides to describe how the @entity10 were reacting to things			0
" and as for reporting about the book that played up the first lady 's concerns about the advice the president was getting from some of his top aides , including @entity75 , @entity11 told @entity33 her interviews revealed @entity17 and @entity75 " were philosophical foils			1
" " they had a distant relationship , " @entity11 continued , " and the relationship did have tension			0
the tensions are so indirect			0
there are all these messages passed back and forth between aides			0
and they also represent such different visions of where the presidency can go			0
" in the end , the controversy surrounding " the @entity10 " may be the result of @entity11 's frame of reference			0
rather than taking the point of view of the president , @entity11 chose to focus on the first lady and her partnership with him			0
" i felt this was giving us a window into what this life [ in the @entity84 ] was really like , " @entity11 said monday , singling out a vignette in her book about how the first lady reacted to news of a minor security incident			1
the window of a first lady 's view on the @entity84 and the presidency is a telling metaphor -- one that @entity11 sought to convey early on in " the @entity10			1
" soon after @entity285 was elected in 2008 , the @entity10 visited the @entity286 at the @entity84			2
while their husbands talked about economic stimulus , @entity287 showed her successor around the private residence situated between the @entity139 and @entity292			0
according to the book , @entity287 showed @entity17 a window in a sitting room used by past first ladies that looked out over the @entity298 and toward the @entity299			0
" during her husband 's critical meetings and long days at work , @entity287 would stare out the window of her hideaway and feel somehow more connected to him , " @entity11 wrote			0
@entity287 told @entity17 that @entity305 had shown the window to her and that @entity307 had shown it to @entity308 beforehand , and @entity17 should , in turn , show it to her successor as well			0
then @entity11 writes in " @entity222 , " " it was hard to think of a better symbol of the true duties of first ladyhood than that window : keep a close eye on your husband			0
there will be things about the presidency that only you will be able to see			0
o n't expect to be at the heart of the action			0
