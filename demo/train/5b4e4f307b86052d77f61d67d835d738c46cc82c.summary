earlier this year , i traveled to the @entity1 to report on a place that had captured my imagination			1
it is an entire village , where every single resident has severe dementia			1
crippled by the prospect of putting their own parents into extended care facilities , two @entity1 nurses decided to conduct an experiment : build a village for people with dementia and introduce a new level of humanity to the last few years of their lives			1
the result is a cutting - edge medical village , called @entity19			1
it 's the only place of its kind , on its scale , anywhere in the world			1
all of the residents have dementia			1
everyone else , however , from the barber at the local salon to the chefs in the restaurants carry out their regular jobs in addition to being trained as specialized health workers			1
i have never seen anything like it in the world			1
the media are rarely allowed inside , in an effort to minimize the disruption of the residents ' daily lives , but we were granted access in late march			1
we do n't talk about dementia nearly enough as a society , and i know it can be uncomfortable to imagine yourself or a loved one in that position			1
but these conversations do need to happen , more than ever			2
when you consider the developed world , the number of people living with dementia is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050			2
as things stand now , people with dementia are largely ignored			1
they live in non-descript buildings and anonymous wards with lots of white coats , non-stop blaring television , and superfluous sedation			2
but what if more of those wards could look like the picturesque village of @entity19 ? an entire village dedicated to caring for people with dementia			2
here are 5 things i learned on the inside			1
safety first ! six of out 10 people with alzheimer 's disease will wander and become lost , according to the @entity77			2
fortunately , at @entity19 , getting lost is n't a concern			2
there 's only one way in and one way out of the village -- and that doorway is kept staffed and locked 24 hours a day			2
@entity84 , one of @entity19 's founders , told me even the residents who make it to this door are n't necessarily trying to leave			1
like many people with dementia , they simply see a doorway and want to walk through it			2
most of the time , all a staff member has to do is suggest to the resident that the door is broken , and perhaps they should try another			2
i witnessed with my own eyes as residents simply turned themselves around and walk back in the other direction			1
to that end , there are other safety modifications in place			2
an elevator -- something you or i can operate without much thought -- might prove perplexing to someone who suffers from severe dementia			2
at @entity19 , when a resident walks up to the elevator , a motion sensor summons the elevator , opens the door , and automatically takes the resident to the other floor when they step inside and trigger a weight sensor			2
music makes the world go ' round it 's been shown in study after study : music is processed differently in the brain than many other sounds			1
the words and lyrics are activated on the left side of the brain in the language areas , while the tune and melody are more right brained			2
long after patients with dementia lose the ability to carry out a conversation , they can still nod their heads , clap their hands , and stamp their feet			0
i even saw one very quiet man , @entity143 , suddenly start singing along to some traditional @entity1 music while his wife , @entity145 , played the piano			1
" we ca n't talk anymore about everything , but with singing ... you can make a good concert together , " @entity145 said			0
" for me , that 's very important			0
" music brings joy to the residents ' lives			1
they 're able to remember classic @entity1 songs they learned when they were children , even if they have difficulty remembering much about their current day			0

resist the urge to correct a person with dementia the toughest conversation i had while at @entity19 was with a resident named @entity170			0
she was charming and animated , with a smile that warmed the entire room			0
at nearly 90 years old , @entity170 was still under the impression that she held a daily job , though she could n't recall what it was			0
" tomorrow , " she told me , " i 'll know it , and i 'll have to go to it			0
" additionally , not only was she under the impression that her parents were still alive , but furthermore that she had just seen them the day before			0
i asked resident social worker @entity183 about her strategy when it comes to correcting confusion like this			0
" it depends on the phase of dementia , " she said			0
" in the beginning , you can ask , ' well , how old are you ? ' and someone says , ' i 'm 84			0
' you say , ' how old would your parents be ? ' and they can think , ' oh , that does n't make sense			0
' " @entity183 says the one absolute no - no when dealing with people with dementia is correcting them			0
" if one person is having breakfast and they already had breakfast but want it again , you ca n't say , " no , you ca n't			0
you 've already had breakfast " he wo n't know , so why would you say it ? " she told me			1
the memories are fading and their sense of judgment and logic has become impaired			0
always keep up appearances one of the most productive things you can do to help keep a person with dementia from feeling lost , frightened , or agitated is to help them live as familiar a life as possible			1
to that end , at @entity19 , residents live in one of seven different " lifestyle " categories : religious , cultural , urban , homemaker , trade / craft , upper class , and @entity226			1
the moods evoked by the furnishing , decoration , and art in each home create an experience reminiscent of each individual 's formative years			0
residents are also scheduled for regular appointments with the village hairdresser , @entity238			1
she told me when the residents simply get their hair combed , it has a calming effect			1
they feel as if they 're being cared for and pampered			0
" sometimes i have customers that come in very unhappy , " she told me			0
" they look in the mirror , and they feel good			0
i think it 's very important			0
hand holding is good for the heart and head i spent the majority of my time at @entity19 with two couples , @entity145 and @entity143 , as well as @entity259 and @entity260			1
throughout my interviews with each pair , they sat holding hands			1
" it 's not possible to talk about everything ( anymore ) , " @entity145 told me , " but we still have this possibility			0
" " it 's the way we communicate , " @entity260 said			0
" she squeezes whenever she sees something or feels something			0
we spend the whole day like this			0
" @entity260 told me his marriage is the best it 's been in nearly 60 years .			0

@entity275 : ' @entity163 ' is one of the most humane things i 've seen
keeping up appearances helps residents cope
music and hand holding keep residents comforted , calm
a safe *environment* is key
