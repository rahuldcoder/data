-- modern technology has made campaigning much easier in some ways			0
it 's now possible to raise millions in small donations through the @entity5 , host @entity7 town halls and galvanize millions of supporters through @entity9			0
an ad can be released on @entity11 and attract enough media coverage to make it worthwhile without spending a dime on tv time			0
technology is also a double - edged sword that 's made campaigning more complicated			0
a candidate 's every word can now be captured by modern technology and live in e-perpetuity			0
there is no such thing as wiping the slate clean after the primary			1
candidates should be read their @entity27 before beginning a campaign			0
anything they say can and will be used against them			0
how can @entity31 contend with some of the things he said during the primary campaign which will come back to haunt him in the general election ? he needs to gracefully pivot			1
nowhere is this more true than in his outreach efforts with @entity39			0
@entity31 can not @entity40 ( blatant pandering to @entity39 , usually involving mariachi music and merciless butchering of the @entity45 language )			1
he can not flip - flop on immigration ( again )			2
he 's fought the flip - flopper label for years , and neither the right that still does n't entirely trust him nor the left that is salivating to defeat him will let him get away with a drastic change of position			2
@entity31 desperately needs to improve his numbers with @entity54			1
polls show @entity31 trailing by as much as an unbelievable 50 percentage points behind president @entity58 with @entity60 voters			1
in 2008 , @entity62 sen. @entity61 won 31 % of the @entity39 vote			0
it cost him states like @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
unless @entity31 gets close to 40 % of the @entity39 vote , he can kiss the @entity70 goodbye			1
polls also show that immigration is not the most important issue for @entity54			1
like other @entity75 , we are most concerned about the economy			0
still , immigration does set a tone			2
if @entity54 perceive a candidate as anti-immigrant , it can turn them off , period			1
so , what 's @entity31 to do ? he ca n't erase the things he 's said on immigration			1
despite his campaign 's efforts , they ca n't make supporters ( or an adviser ) like @entity91 disappear , and he is as radioactive as @entity92 in the @entity39 community			1
however , all 's not lost			0
from now until @entity95 , when @entity31 gets asked an immigration question , he needs to start and finish by reminding @entity54 that @entity58 promised , without caveats , to get immigration reform passed in his first year in office			1
@entity100 : why @entity101 ca n't save the @entity102 for many @entity54 , a person 's word is sacred			1
@entity31 should unequivocally say that @entity58 broke his word and dramatically increased deportation rates , causing family separation			1
he should sound angry and indignant about it			0
@entity31 needs to go from playing defense to playing offense on immigration			1
hispanics are disillusioned with @entity58			1
he too is vulnerable on the issue but only if @entity31 exploits that weakness			1
@entity31 has to remain staunchly anti-amnesty and pro-border security but at the same time sound sympathetic and understanding of the desperation of people who often risk their lives crossing a border so they can put food on their family 's table			2
he needs to talk about the benefits of immigration and how the richness of our diversity has made us a stronger country			0
if @entity31 can neutralize the immigration issue by moderating his tone , giving more nuanced answers and taking the offensive against @entity58 , then he can focus on other issues			1
@entity39 are an aspirational people			0
we seek opportunities to provide a better life to our children			0
@entity31 should take every chance to remind @entity54 that we have been disproportionately affected by the bad economy			1
as a group , @entity39 have suffered some of the highest unemployment , foreclosure and poverty rates			0
if @entity54 are asked whether they are better off than four years ago , the answer is " no , @entity147 or			2
" @entity31 is also going to have to put the time and resources into @entity60 outreach			1
if he expects to make up the lost ground , @entity39 can not be an afterthought			0
his campaign needs to wake up and go to sleep every night thinking of the @entity39 vote			0
they 'd be well served to embrace and deploy strong surrogates like @entity157 , @entity101 and @entity158			0
they speak the language not only literally but culturally			0
@entity54 want to be courted			2
@entity58 has accepted speaking invitations to the @entity163 and @entity164 conferences			2
@entity31 needs to do the same , pronto , and he needs to make it count by delivering memorable speeches			2
come @entity95 , i do n't know whether @entity31 is going to do better with @entity39 than the polls indicate or if @entity58 is going to do worse			1
@entity31 needs a lot of both to happen if he wants to move into @entity170			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : polls show @entity31 way behind @entity58 among @entity54
she says @entity31 ca n't wipe slate clean , erase what he said in the primaries
she said he can pivot to show he understands the value of immigration
@entity186 : @entity31 needs to address economic issues and court @entity60 voters
