-- the @entity2 navy has filed criminal charges against two journalists over a report tying military personnel to human trafficking			1
the criminal defamation and computer crimes charges against the reporters from @entity11 -- a news website in the province of @entity14 -- relate to the july 17 article that included information from a @entity18 investigative piece that alleged some @entity2 naval forces have been profiting from the smuggling of ethnic @entity22 migrants fleeing violence in neighboring @entity24			1
according to the charge sheet , the navy accuses the journalists of knowingly publishing false information and committing slander			2
if found guilty , veteran @entity30 journalist and editor of @entity11 , @entity32 as well as reporter @entity33 , a @entity2 citizen , could face up five years behind bars			2
a navy official filed the suit against @entity32 and @entity37 last week on december 16			0
two days later the journalists were fingerprinted at a @entity14 police station and denied all charges , @entity32 told @entity0			2
@entity41 has condemned the move , warning the charges threaten press freedom in @entity2			1
" the @entity2 navy 's lawsuit is a reckless attempt to curtail journalists ' reporting on alleged human trafficking by its officers , " said @entity44 , @entity45 director at @entity41 in a statement issued thursday			1
" unless the government withdraws the case , its impact will be felt far beyond those reporting on abuses against the @entity22 -- and could have a choking effect on all investigative reporting in @entity2 , " he added			1
journalists from @entity18 could face similar charges over the original article , according to @entity41 , however the news agency said that it has not been notified of any legal action			1
" our story was fair and balanced and @entity18 has not been accused of criminal libel , " said @entity68 's @entity67 , @entity69			1
denying the charges , @entity32 said the @entity18 report was published by media outlets around the world and the actions of the @entity76 has him and his colleague puzzled			1
" the mystery is why the navy has chosen to sue @entity11 journalists over these allegations , " @entity32 and @entity78 said in a statement			2
" the article at the center of the charge on @entity11 was a selection from the @entity18 special report on the @entity22			1
the paragraph and headline in question does not name the @entity92 , " @entity32 told @entity0 on sunday			0
" the navy 's action over one paragraph has created a perfect storm			0
if the navy proceeds with the case , the @entity22 issue is now tied up in their action against media under a controversial law			1
" an official from the @entity92 , who asked not to be named , told @entity0 the navy , " does not intend to obstruct any media from , or threaten any media for performing their duties			2
what we are trying to do is to protect our organization from false allegations			0
" " @entity11 and @entity18 jounalists have put out their accusing statements without reaching us and providing us at least a fair chance to explain , " the official added			0
@entity32 , 65 , is originally from @entity114			0
he produces @entity115 and also freelances for international media , including @entity0 , the @entity117 and the @entity118			0

@entity32 said it is expected police will ask for formal statements from the reporters			0
if convicted , they could face jail time of up to five years under @entity2 's controversial @entity128 , as well as a fine of up to 100,000 baht ( $ 3,300 )			0
the @entity128 , which came into force in @entity2 in 2007 , seeks to bar the spread of material believed to threaten national security or create panic			0
but the law has attracted criticism from freedom of expression advocates and global internet providers for making online users liable for reproducing content originally published by others			0
it 's believed to be the first time an arm of the @entity2 military has used the law against the media , @entity32 said			1
he described the authorities ' response to the @entity18 story as like " breaking a butterfly on a wheel			2
" @entity11 , although a small organization , has become known for its investigations into allegations of abuse against @entity22 people in @entity2 and corruption on the island of @entity14			1
each year , boats carrying hundreds of @entity22 fleeing ethnic and religious violence in @entity24 are intercepted in @entity2 waters by authorities			1
@entity2 has a policy of what it calls " helping on " the @entity22 to @entity166			1
several media reports and rights advocates claim some @entity22 end up in the hands of people smugglers who demand money for their release			2
@entity0 's @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
