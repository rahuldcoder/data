-- at the start of the 2012 @entity7 season , with a driver pairing that comprised of a virtual rookie and a former world champion who had been out of the sport for two years , little was expected of @entity8			1
but the combination of 2007 title winner @entity10 and @entity12 , whose only previous experience in @entity7 was seven unspectacular races for the team in 2009 , has flourished , collecting 84 points from the season 's opening five races			1
the highlight of a promising start was a double podium finish for @entity8 in @entity22 , a result which contributed to @entity10 's current position of fourth in the early - season drivers ' standings , with @entity12 eighth ahead of the next race in @entity29 on may 27			1
the team 's on - track success has been played out against a backdrop of financial upheaval , with owner @entity34 having terminated a lucrative longterm sponsorship deal with @entity8 -- owned by the @entity38 car manufacturer @entity37			1
the @entity40 - based outfit will , however , continue to race under one of the most famous names in motorsport			0
fire mars @entity46 's first grand prix win team principal @entity47 insists that there are sufficient sponsorship deals to plug the monetary gap created by @entity8 ' departure			1
" we have not lost our title sponsor -- not in the real sense of the word lost			1
we have decided to end the contract , or the agreement , we had with them at the middle of last year , " @entity47 told the official @entity7 website			2
" we wanted to change our strategy , and actually we are , if i may say so , wealthier than we were before			0
we have bigger budgets this year and will keep the name @entity8 under a license agreement			2
" we have signed some big names as sponsors			0
if you look at my shirt , there are two new names on it			0
we have been able to sign deals with @entity73 and @entity74 , which are two really big names			0
" @entity47 said the @entity22 race was a fitting tribute to the work put in by the team -- who previously competed under the @entity81 name			1
latest @entity7 standings " it was a fantastic reward			0
we have n't performed in that mode since 2006 , " he said			0
" the fact is we were expecting to deliver something after the first three races , but we had to come to terms with the little glitches we had			0
when that was done -- voila -- it finally worked			0
" @entity47 said there was a good relationship building between experienced former @entity95 driver @entity10 , who is is in his 10th @entity7 campaign , and @entity97 -- a 26 - year - old who has yet to complete a full season			1
" obviously @entity10 , with his experience , his character and personality , tends to have a certain degree of leadership			2
but in fact it is not leadership but probably more attention , " @entity47 said			2
@entity95 pile pressure on @entity110 " on the other hand @entity12 is digging a little place for himself nicely and is getting a lot of respect every weekend from the team			1
" you must not forget that @entity10 has done something in the range of 160 grands prix and @entity12 has just finished his 12th grand prix this weekend			1
" @entity47 said the 32 - year - old @entity10 , who collected another podium finish at last weekend 's @entity123 @entity122 , has adapted well to life at @entity8 ' @entity126 headquarters			1
" @entity10 does n't like @entity127 , does n't like media			2
so why should we bother him with it ? sure we need a balance between his demands and the requests from our sponsors , " @entity47 said			0
" but he knows that we care very much about his schedule and try to minimize his obligations			0
he is a racer so he races for winning and hardly cares about the rest ! " @entity10 is like a wild animal and you have to let him run the way he wants to go			2
we do n't have to tell him what he has to do because he is a professional and we want him to deliver on track first			0
