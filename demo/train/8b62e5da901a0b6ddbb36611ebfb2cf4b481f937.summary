@entity3 , @entity4 -- " what are we going to call the country ? what is the flag going to look like ? what is the currency going to be called ? " these are not questions most six - year - olds are concerned with -- unless you are @entity14			1
" i grew up in an environment where the struggle for the country , the liberation of this country , was very much a part of the conversation in the home , " says @entity14 , a renowned @entity4 playwright and daughter of the country 's former vice president , @entity16			1
" for me , @entity4 is not an abstract concept , " she says			1
" it 's something that i heard being birthed in the house that i lived in -- even the name of the country , the answer came from our house			1
my father coined the name and it was agreed that this country would be called @entity4			1
" @entity36 : curtains up from a young age , @entity14 was surrounded by the changemakers who helped liberate the @entity41 nation from @entity43 colonial rule			1
an artistic child , it was not uncommon to find a young @entity14 at the theater or opera with her father enjoying the performance right beside her			1
his encouragement for @entity14 to follow her passion into the arts has led to a fruitful and illustrious career as one of the nation 's most beloved and respected playwrights			1
undaunted by her lack of formal theater education , @entity14 began writing her own plays early on in her career			2
" i 'd begun to write the history of my tribe , " she recalls			2
" and as i got into it and i dug into it , i thought this would make a really good play , but i did n't know how to write a play , " explains @entity14			1
" i told myself , ' well , i do n't think @entity69 went to a playwright school so i 'm sure i do n't have to			0
" and she was right			0
over the years , @entity14 , who is also the chairperson of the @entity71 , has received countless accolades for her theater work			1
her plays all focused on issues that dug deep into the history and culture of @entity4 , looking at the role female leaders played in traditional life prior to colonization , and questioning why this is no longer the case			1
act two : build it and they will come away from the stage , @entity14 has involved herself with many projects to try help @entity4 youths			1
she has built libraries in @entity3 , @entity4 's capital , to give young children the opportunity to read and further educate themselves			1
" one thing about books and my father , is that we had a lot of books when we were growing up			0
so i got into building libraries because i feel other people must have the same experience that i had			0
and especially for me the people who might not have the opportunity			0
@entity14 would eventually build not one , not two , but three temples of literature in @entity3			2
" what would a library in @entity41 look like ? you know , a library is about knowledge , and a place where you can get knowledge , but also , we kind of mix it up with the traditional @entity41 hut , where you discuss things and you are mentored			0
you get knowledge and you interact , there 's drama			0
there 's also sorts of things going on			0
" act three : a lasting legacy that ingenuity to inspire @entity4 youth led the vivacious playwright to her next endeavor -- a record label			2
after stumbling across traditional native music at the @entity132 , @entity14 wanted new ears to hear its majesty			2
" i thought let me get the music and give it to young people so that they can work with it and then they can put it back into the public ear , " says @entity14 says , record label has so far produced three albums			2
the cultural ringmaster 's ambition would n't stop there			2
@entity14 went on to found the @entity146 to provide teens with a space to embrace music , as well as create a youth sports team -- the @entity152 football team -- to keep young girls " off the streets			2
" a true tour de force for @entity4 arts and culture , @entity14 has no plans to slow down anytime soon			1
in fact , her next goal is direct a film			0
ultimately she 's unafraid of failure because to this patron of the arts , if you do n't try , then you wo n't succeed			1
she says : " do n't abandon your ideas			0
you can scale them down			0
you can do whatever it is , but keep at it			0
and you learn , keep learning , and ducking and diving until you get what you want			0
that 's been my lesson			0
success is wonderful , but so is failure			0
