-- every 40 seconds someone in the world takes their own life , a global tally of more than 800,000 suicides a year , according to a landmark @entity8 report on the subject			1
the research found that suicide killed more people each year than conflicts and natural catastrophes , accounting for more than half of the world 's 1.5 million violent deaths annually , @entity12 staff told reporters at its presentation in @entity23			1
the report , the @entity8 agency 's first on the subject , analyzed data on suicides from 172 countries , and took a decade to compile			2
setting a goal to cut national suicide rates by 10 percent by 2020 , the organization said suicide was a major but preventable health problem that health authorities had failed to adequately address due to a number of complicated factors			0
shrouded in taboo " this report is a call for action to address a large public health problem which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long , " dr. @entity38 , director - general of the @entity12 , said in a statement			2
while warning that data on national suicide rates was imperfect , with fewer than half the surveyed countries keeping accurate figures , the @entity12 said it used available data to produce estimates on suicide prevalence worldwide			1
the global rate was estimated at 11.4 per 100,000 , with men almost twice as likely as women to take their own lives -- rising to as many as three times more male victims than female in some richer countries			1
on average , high - income countries had a slightly higher suicide rate -- 12.7 per 100,000 people -- than low - and middle - income nations , where the rate was 11.2			1
mental health help : where to turn highest rates the most suicide - prone countries were @entity69 ( 44.2 per 100,000 ) , followed by @entity70 ( 38.5 ) , @entity71 ( 28.9 ) , @entity72 ( 28.8 ) , @entity73 ( 28.2 ) , @entity74 ( 27.8 ) , @entity75 ( 27.4 ) , @entity76 and @entity77 ( 24.9 each ) and @entity78 ( 23.1 )			2
the report found suicide rates were highest globally among those aged 70 years and over , but highest among the young in some countries -- and was the second leading cause of death for 15 - 29 year - olds globally			1
among the challenges in tackling suicide were intense media coverage when celebrities kill themselves , as witnessed in the recent death of @entity90 comedian @entity89 , which could glamorize the act and fuel suicide " contagion , " the report stated			0
opinion : suicide does n't set you free most vulnerable another factor was that suicide victims often came from marginalized groups and were difficult to access with interventions			0
the report stated that the most common methods of suicide globally were pesticide poisoning -- particularly in rural areas -- hanging and firearms			0
evidence had shown that restricting access to these methods can could help reduce the number of deaths			0
also vital to lowering the suicide rate was a commitment by governments to implement national action plans on suicide -- something only 28 countries currently had in place			1
" we know what works , " said dr. @entity122 , the @entity12 's mental health director			0
" now is the time to act			0
" ' suicide tourism ' to @entity128 has doubled since 2009			0
