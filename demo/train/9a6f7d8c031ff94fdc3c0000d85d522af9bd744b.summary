the critical @entity2 vulnerability that is currently under attack was made possible by an incomplete patch @entity6 developers issued last year to fix an earlier security bug , a researcher said			1
the revelation , made friday by @entity9 of @entity11 - based @entity10 , is the latest black eye for @entity6 's @entity2 software framework which is installed on more than 1 billion pcs , smartphones , and other devices			1
miscreants use these exploits to turn compromised websites into platforms for silently installing keyloggers and other types of malicious software on the computers of unsuspecting visitors			2
last year saw a steady stream of attacks that exploited @entity2 vulnerabilities , allowing miscreants to surreptitiously install keyloggers and other malicious software when unwitting people browsed compromised websites			1
the abuse has already continued into 2013 , when on thursday researchers reported yet another critical bug that is being " massively exploited in the wild "			0
according to @entity9 , the latest vulnerability is a holdover from a bug ( referred to here as @entity42 ) that @entity10 researchers reported to @entity6 in late august			1
@entity6 released a patch for the issue in october but it was incomplete , he said in an e-mail to @entity48 that was later published to the @entity50 mailing list			1
" bugs are like mushrooms , in many cases they can be found in a close proximity to those already spotted , " @entity9 wrote			0
" it looks like @entity6 either stopped the picking too early or they are still deep in the woods			2
" @entity6 representatives did n't immediately respond to a request for comment			1
this post will be updated if a reply comes later			0
people who do n't use @entity2 much should once again consider unplugging @entity2 from their browser , while those who do n't use it at all may want to uninstall it altogether			1
the release notes for @entity68 — the most recent version — say users can disable the program from the browser by accessing the @entity73			0
@entity74 has instructions here for other ways to do this			0
exploits of the latest @entity2 vulnerability , which were first observed more than a month ago , are the combination of two bugs			1
the first involves the @entity82 ( ) method and allows the loading of arbitrary ( restricted ) classes			0
the second bug relies on the @entity88 method call and was also a problem with @entity42 that @entity6 purportedly patched in october			2
" however , it turns out that the fix was not complete as one can still abuse @entity88 method to setup calls to @entity95 method with a trusted system class as a target method caller , " @entity9 wrote			0
" this time the call is however done to methods of new @entity100 ( from java.lang.invoke			0
* package ) , of which many rely on security checks conducted against the caller of the target method			0
" developers of the @entity109 framework for hackers and penetration testers have released a module that should exploit the vulnerability on machines running @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 regardless of the browser they 're using			2
the @entity121 - @entity120 , which is affiliated with the @entity122 , is advising people to disable @entity2 in web browsers .			2

@entity2 vulnerability is *due* to incomplete patch by @entity6 , researcher says
@entity2 's software is on more than 1 billion pcs , smartphones and other computers
people who do n't use @entity2 are *encouraged* to uninstall it
