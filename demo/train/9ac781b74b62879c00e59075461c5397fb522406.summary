it is the trial of the century for @entity1			1
@entity1 crowded around televisions , struggling to glimpse former president @entity3 in a white prisoner 's uniform when the court session began on august 3 , 2011			1
despite being the fasting holy month of @entity8 , hundreds of people braved the scorching heat and inevitable thirst to bare witness to these historic proceedings on a large monitor erected by the government outside the courthouse			0
the world 's media was also in attendance trying to scavenge any scrap of information about the man who ruled @entity1 for more than 30 years			1
the police rolled @entity3 into the courtroom on a hospital gurney and despite his sons ' best efforts to shield their father , the image of a tired , sickly old man shot around the world			1
this was the first time we had seen the former president since handing over power on february 10 , 2011			0
the trial would last almost a year during which rumors constantly swirled about @entity3 's health			1
fueled by his lawyer , @entity3 always seemed to be on his deathbed			1
numerous media reports also emerged of his death only later to be proven false			0
they got so bad that it became an @entity1 joke : " @entity3 's doctor visited him in the hospital and told him , ' you have to stop dying , it is n't good for your health			1
' " during the year of his trial , @entity1 would witness the dramatic rise of the @entity55 , which would come to dominate the political scene			1
the organization , once heavily repressed by @entity3 , would sweep parliamentary elections garnering almost 50 % of the seats			2
the trial 's proceeding concluded almost a month before president @entity62 , from the @entity55 , would be sworn into office			2
the verdict on june 2 , 2012 reflected the times			0
once again the world stopped to watch what would be the fate of the first @entity70 leader to stand trial since the beginning of the @entity73			0
the judge found @entity3 and co-defendants guilty on charges of failing to stop the killings of protesters			1
they were given life in prison , which in @entity1 is 25 years			1
an 84 - year - old @entity3 would n't see the outside of a prison again			2
the defendants appealed and the retrial began in january 2013			0
it would take more than 50 sessions to arrive at a verdict but this time @entity3 's trial would be overshadowed by growing turmoil in the country			1
@entity1 's @entity92 dissolved the first democratically elected parliament after declaring it unconstitutional			2
the @entity1 military ousted @entity62 on july 3 , 2013 following another popular uprising			2
security forces began arresting the @entity55 's leadership and thousands of their followers			0
the following august , security forces would clear @entity62 supporters from two squares in @entity1 resulting in more than 1,000 people killed			1
@entity62 now stands trial over the death of protesters as well as an array of other charges			2
from the chaos emerged @entity109			0
he served as the head of military intelligence under @entity3 and was promoted by @entity62 to be minister of defense			2
he oversaw the overthrow of @entity62 and handover of power to @entity117 , although many believed @entity119 remained the power behind the throne			0
in may of this year , @entity1 elected him president and thus the fourth recent leader of @entity1			1
today 's verdict reflects the times			0
fewer people were outside the courthouse for the trial			0
small bands of protesters took to the streets			0
most @entity1 vented their anger online			0
talking to @entity3 supporters and protesters on both sides , they did agree on one thing			1
they told me the revolution is dead			0
but the drama is n't over yet ; the prosecution has one last appeal available .			0

@entity3 was *convicted* in 2012 for the deaths of protesters , but was given a new trial
the former president ruled @entity1 for almost 30 years before *resigning* amid protests
on *saturday* , former president cleared of causing deaths of protesters
@entity3 supporters and protesters on both sides say : the revolution is dead
