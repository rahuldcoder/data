police militarization — the issue that briefly united conservatives and liberals over @entity4 — has turned out to be a dud			1
a @entity7 review suggests largely leaving intact federal programs that provide surplus military equipment to local police departments			1
president @entity11 ordered the review after widely criticized heavy - handed police response to august protests following the shooting of @entity15			1
a report released by the @entity7 on monday suggested making improvements to the programs , to standardize training and better track equipment			1
but the @entity7 response falls short of wholesale changes that some suggested should be made after police deployed military - style vehicles on the streets of @entity4 , @entity27 , after the @entity15 shooting			1
efforts in @entity30 to rein in the programs have also fizzled			0
the @entity7 report concluded : " these programs , in the main , have been valuable and have provided state and local law enforcement with needed assistance as they carry out their critical missions in helping to keep the @entity38 people safe			2
" between 2009 and 2014 , the federal government has provided nearly $ 18 billion in funds and resources to support programs that provide equipment and tactical resources to state and local law enforcement			1
the vast majority of that money goes to back office equipment , with only 4 percent of property going to heavier , more controlled equipment			0
police tactical units in recent years have taken to wearing camouflage and some agencies have received heavy - duty battlefield vehicles known as @entity57 , an acronym for @entity57 vehicles			0
what many saw as militarization , some law enforcement officials say , was what has come to be standard gear used by @entity66 teams , which are n't routinely deployed on civilian streets			0
some law enforcement officials say that instead of focusing on equipment , more attention should be paid to police training			2
@entity73 officials have pushed for improved training for @entity76 - area police agencies , moving away from " warrior " tendencies and toward being " guardians " for communities that police serve			0
the @entity7 report released monday suggested standardizing training for police to respect civil rights and liberties			2
the president plans to issue an executive order to tighten some of the controls over the programs to better track equipment provided to law enforcement agencies			0
the @entity7 also plans to boost funding to pay for 50,000 body cameras for police officers .			0

@entity7 review largely leaves intact federal programs that provide police with surplus military equipment
the response falls short of what some had called for in the wake of the @entity15 shooting
more training will help ease *concerns* about police militarization , @entity7 review says
