-- football officials are apologizing to ticket - holding fans who were denied seats at sunday 's @entity4 , but that may not be enough to stop lawsuits over the issue from going ahead			1
@entity9 commissioner @entity8 on monday took full responsibility for the seating fiasco , in which about 400 fans with tickets were denied seats because certain sections of @entity17 in @entity18 , which hosted the event , were n't ready			1
a total of about 1,250 fans were affected , but roughly 850 of them were relocated to other seats , while the remaining 400 were left without , the @entity9 said			1
some people in the @entity26 organization volunteered to give up their employee tickets so affected fans could have a seat , @entity8 said			1
" we apologize to those fans that were impacted by this , " @entity8 said at a news conference monday			2
" we will certainly do a thorough review and get to the bottom of why it all occurred , but we take full responsibility for that as putting on this game			0
" @entity9 executive vice president @entity41 said the problem was officials " just ran out of time " to complete infrastructure like railings and steps and to tighten risers			1
employees were still trying to get the work done as late as sunday afternoon , he said			2
the @entity51 won the @entity4 on sunday night , defeating the @entity52 31 - 25			1
@entity53 , 40 , a @entity52 fan originally from @entity54 , was one of the 400 or so fans left without a seat at the big game			1
after spending the whole day being moved around to different parts of the stadium while officials tried to accommodate them , @entity53 and others were eventually moved to a glassed - in bar just below field level where they could watch the game on television monitors , he said			1
what view they had of the field was obscured by those standing on the sidelines , he added			0
" it was happening 300 feet in front of us , but ( it was as though ) we were n't there , " @entity53 told @entity0 on his way back from @entity18 on tuesday			0
after halftime , @entity53 said , he and others were so frustrated that they left the stadium , and he watched the remainder from his hotel room			2
@entity53 said he spent a total of about $ 5,000 to attend the @entity4 with his wife			1
he spent $ 800 per ticket , which he purchased through the @entity52 ' season - ticket - holder lottery			1
the @entity9 promised to give a free ticket to next year 's @entity4 and a refund of triple the cost of the $ 800 face value of the ticket to each of the 400 fans denied seats on sunday -- or a free ticket to a future @entity4 game of the fan 's choice , plus round - trip airfare and hotel accommodations			1
fans can pick the option they want			2
but @entity53 said that does n't make up for the anger , frustration , and disappointment he still feels at missing his beloved @entity52 at the big game			0
" i actually feel worse for the @entity51 fans , because they missed their team winning the game , " he said			2
@entity53 said he 's further angered by @entity41 's revelation that football officials were aware of a potential seating problem as early as the middle of last week			0
@entity41 said officials had still hoped to complete the work by game day , so they did n't warn fans about a problem			2
" we made a judgment that we had a very good shot to be able to complete it , " @entity41 said			0
" we made a judgment that it was the right course of action to bring the fans in , rather than discourage them or create a sense that they would n't have the information necessary			2
" @entity26 owner @entity128 on monday said the @entity26 " deeply regret " the problems experienced by the affected fans and share the responsibility for it with the @entity9			1
@entity53 has started @entity133 , one of at least two websites for fans mulling possible lawsuits over the seating issue			2
he said he is obtaining legal counsel and is urging affected fans to get in touch			2
so far he has heard from about a dozen people , he said			0
" we 're still figuring out what our rights are , whether damages come into play or not , " he said			0
" this is more than just a breach of contract			0
... this was a very traumatic experience for a lot of these people			0
" another website compiling submissions from angry fans is @entity158 , started by @entity159 of @entity160			0
@entity159 , 26 , told @entity0 he was one of the 850 fans initially denied a seat but later accommodated			1
he went to the game with his father , who was able to enter the stadium -- but when @entity159 presented his ticket , he was told to go to the ticket resolution center			1
he said he waited there with other fans for nearly three hours with no information from officials			0
eventually , @entity159 said , someone from the @entity9 handed them fliers that promised the triple refund and entry to a hospitality area to watch the game			1
angry and frustrated , that 's when he started his website , using his cell phone , @entity159 said			0
in the end , @entity159 said , he was able to join his father in the stands in their original seats -- but he said he still feels a duty to keep the site running			0
" the @entity9 has an ethical , moral obligation to rectify this , and i have a moral obligation because the site 's at the forefront of the situation , " @entity159 said , adding he does n't feel the league is doing enough			1
@entity159 and @entity53 said they 're in touch with each other and are coordinating their efforts			0
@entity159 said he 's not focusing on lawsuits as much as trying to collect the stories of affected fans ; so far he has had about 250 submissions , including about 50 detailed stories			0
asked about possible lawsuits , @entity8 said monday , " we 're more concerned with making sure we take care of the fans in an appropriate way , and that 's what we 're going to focus on			0

new : fans can choose tickets to @entity4 2012 or one of their choosing , @entity9 says
about 400 ticket - holders failed to get seats on sunday
another 850 had to be accommodated in other parts of the stadium
some fans are *thinking* of suing the @entity9
