-- the old deal made rough sense			0
the @entity3 would provide only a very thin social - insurance cushion for people of working age , but jobs would always be available			1
critics might deride the jobs as @entity10 : often poorly paid , often offering scanty benefits			1
but better mcjobs than @entity13			0
to anyone who proposed tighter job protections or more generous social benefits workers came the crushing answer , " do you want us to be like @entity20 ? " while @entity3 generated tens of millions of low - wage service jobs , the economies of @entity20 struggled hard not to lose jobs , even during good times			1
the tradeoff was patiently explained by free - market economists and is by now familiar to us all			2
more job rules mean less jobs ; fewer rules will bring more jobs			2
and for a quarter - century , from 1982 until 2007 , the old deal held true			2
wages did n't rise much , but demand for nurses ' aides , fast food servers and other low - wage service workers surged and surged -- so much that for the first time since 1913 , the @entity3 again found itself welcoming a mass immigration of poor people , arriving legally and illegally from @entity42 and @entity43 , eager to accept @entity3 's abundant $ 9 - an - hour jobs			1
then , suddenly , the old deal broke down			0
it broke down as abruptly , as utterly and as seemingly irretrievably as a previous old deal broke in 1929			0
@entity47 and long - term joblessness characterize the @entity3 economy of 2014 as surely as plentiful low - wage jobs characterized the @entity3 economy of 15 years ago			1
look at the output statistics , and the @entity3 has recovered from the crisis of 2008			1
look at the job numbers , and it seems the @entity3 never will			1
what are @entity3 to think of and do about their new economic dispensation ? one answer is to deny that the dispensation is new at all			1
@entity60 in @entity61 are working to repeal the emergency job benefits put in place in 2009 , on the familiar theory that if we quit paying the unemployed , they 'll stop being unemployed			2
extended unemployment insurance coverage lapsed on saturday ; 1.3 million long - term jobless lost benefits that day , and those still receiving benefits will lose them if they remain without work for longer than 26 weeks			1
food stamp coverage has been cut once and will probably be cut again in 2014			1
proposals to raise the minimum wage gain no hearing in the @entity60 - majority @entity75 , whose members condemn such proposals as job - killers			2
yet these familiar arguments bump into an unfamiliar situation			0
almost six years after the economic collapse of 2008 , the ratio of job seekers to unfilled positions -- which peaked at 5.5 to 1 -- has declined to 2.9 to 1 , a ratio that would until now have indicated severe recession			0
the huge backlog of unemployed workers exerts downward pressure on the wages of those still working			2
the old employment deal seems a formula for a massive write - off of the great majority of working @entity3 lacking specialized skills			1
on the other hand , nobody seems to offer any credible new deal			0
some cities and towns are experimenting with higher minimum wages			2
that may put money in the pockets of some workers at @entity108 and @entity109			0
but people who ca n't find work at $ 9 wo n't find it easier to find work if their price is raised to $ 12			0
in a major economic address delivered in @entity117 , @entity118 , in 2011 , president @entity115 speculated that more public - sector hiring might do the trick			1
but how many people can government employ ? and how sustainable is it for government to raise its payroll at exactly the same time as it is also shouldering the rising costs of @entity127 and @entity128 for retiring baby boomers ? these are questions that will dominate @entity3 politics for years to come			1
as the @entity20 experience of the 1990s sadly reminds us , mass prolonged unemployment is not a problem that recedes rapidly in a peacetime economy			0
people who have been out of work would find it hard to return to work even in a strong job market -- and this job market remains desperately weak			0
what we can at least do is refrain from further penalizing people whose problems nobody knows how to fix			0
people who ca n't work still must eat			0
@entity3 in distress have a claim on the rest of the nation			1
while we 're looking for a new deal , at least quit deluding ourselves that the old deal is still operable			0
it has passed on , from everywhere except our increasingly outdated memories			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			2

@entity162 : @entity47 joblessness is n't going away ; wages are falling
@entity167 : @entity3 used to provide minimal benefits but lots of jobs , but not now
public - sector hiring is *helpful* , he says , but how many can government employ or *afford* ?
@entity167 : cuts to food stamp and unemployment benefits *punish* jobless when no jobs exist
