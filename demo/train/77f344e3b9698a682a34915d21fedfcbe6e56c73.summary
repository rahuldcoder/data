she wrote of being in love , falling out of love , fearing a marriage to a skirt - chaser and then loving that marriage , and believing in @entity6 to hold on to the hope of reuniting with her assassinated husband			1
letters that a young @entity11 , and later a married @entity11 , wrote to a catholic priest in @entity13 offer a rare and revealing glimpse of the private thoughts of one of @entity18 's most admired first ladies			1
an icon of style and elegance , she came to symbolize an administration nicknamed @entity23 that ended with the violent death of president @entity25 in november 1963			0
over a period from when she first met the rev. @entity27 on a trip to @entity13 in 1950 until he died in 1964 , she wrote him more than two dozen letters			1
she only met him in person once more , in 1955 , but the letters being sold at auction in @entity13 provide insight into the personal dreams , wishes and fears of a young woman who became one of the world 's most popular figures			1
revealing letters part of her popularity involved the mystique of @entity11 , the focus of near - rabid media attention who later married @entity51 shipping magnate @entity49			1
while others sought to chronicle the woman and her life , she provided little help through the years			0
" it 's so good in a way to write all this down and get it off your chest - because i never do really talk about it with anyone , " she said in one letter			2
the correspondence shows the maturation of a high society girl who broke off an engagement with @entity71 stockbroker @entity69 before she met the dashing young politician she would marry			1
" so terribly much in love -- for the first time -- and i want to get married			0
and i know i will marry this boy , " she wrote of @entity69			0
" i do n't have to think and wonder -- as i always have before -- if they are the right one , how we 'd get along etc. ... i just know he is and it 's the deepest happiest feeling in the world			0
" things changed , as she later described to @entity27			0
" i 'm ashamed that we both went into it so quickly and gaily , but i think the suffering it brought us both for a while afterwards was the best thing -- we both need something of a shock to make us grow up , " she wrote			0
" i do n't know if @entity25 has -- i have n't seen him and i do n't really want to , not out of meanness -- it 's just better if that all dies away & we forget we knew each other -- but i know it 's grown me up and it 's about time ! " the next time she gets engaged , she added , it will be " all right and have a happy ending ! " " his career is the driving thing " that next time was to @entity25 , the scion of an influential @entity105 family from @entity106 who became the first @entity18 president of the televised campaign era			1
" if he ever does ask me to marry him , it will be for rather practical reasons - because his career is this driving thing with him , " @entity11 wrote in one letter of @entity25 's political ambitions			1
a 1952 letter , written the year before they wed , showed her understanding of @entity25 's philandering ways , which continued in the @entity119			2
" he 's like my father in a way — loves the chase and is bored with the conquest — and once married needs proof he 's still attractive , so flirts with other women and resents you , " she wrote			2
" i saw how that nearly killed @entity128			0
" she also wondered about the glitzy life she lived , writing that " maybe i 'm just dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and @entity132 -- and not just a sad little housewife			0
" " that world can be very glamorous from the outside -- but if you 're in it -- and you 're lonely -- it could be a @entity138 , " she added			0
" @entity6 will have a bit of explaining to do " despite such concerns , she later wrote @entity27 that she loved being married to the man she called @entity142			2
after @entity25 's assassination , @entity11 wrote of trying to understand it all			1
" i think @entity6 must have taken @entity142 to show the world how lost we would be without him -- but that is a strange way of thinking to me , " she wrote			1
" @entity6 will have a bit of explaining to do to me if i ever see him			2
" another passage showed the depth of her grief			0
" i have to think there is a @entity6 -- or i have no hope of finding @entity142 again , " she wrote			1
50 years later , @entity11 's pink suit locked away from view the letters to @entity27 go up for sale next month at @entity159 's @entity158			1
in effect , an " unpublished autobiography " " we are thrilled at @entity159 's to offer what is in effect the unpublished autobiography of @entity11 , " said a statement by @entity159 , the auctioneer			2
he told @entity168 on tuesday the letters came from a private source and as a trained historian , he satisfied himself that " the source who gave the letters is authentic and that the letters are authentic as well			0
" @entity11 was 21 when her correspondence began with the 73 - year - old @entity27 , and her letters to the priest showed the value she placed on their relationship			2
in one , she discussed the difference between @entity27 and the @entity18 priests she knew , complaining they gave her " a whole lot of trite little phrases that make you angry & resentful and farther away from the church than ever			1
" by contrast , she wrote , @entity27 was " someone who loves everything i love -- who you can have fun with -- who can take you to @entity194 's & the theatre as naturally as to @entity196 -- whom you can talk to about anything in the world and know you wo n't shock them -- and whose whole life is built on love -- love and not fear -- which is what always put me off			0
" one letter to @entity27 ended : " i really must stop now @entity206 -- but bushels , barrels carts & lorry loads of love to you -- @entity211			0
