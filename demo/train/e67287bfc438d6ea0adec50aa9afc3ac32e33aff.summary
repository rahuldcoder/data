-- spotting the " next big thing " in sport is an expensive business			2
millions of dollars and countless hours are spent on talent identification , but it 's an unpredictable science			2
except perhaps in horse racing , where major strides are being made in picking out potential winners in an industry where huge rewards are at stake			1
thoroughbred stallion @entity13 , for example , became the most expensive horse in history in 2000 after being sold to @entity18 's @entity17 for $ 60 million , having been bought as a yearling for $ 4 million			1
so just imagine what it would mean to breeders if they could determine how successful a horse would be before buying or selling them as a foal ? a company involved in thoroughbred research , @entity28 , has been analyzing a particular strand of @entity30 within a horse -- dubbed the " speed gene " -- which can determine just how well equipped it will be for racing			1
such chromosome information can also be a powerful tool for breeders as it helps them determine just what type of horse will be produced by different types of coupling			1
the mating game : @entity43 and @entity44 breed superhorses ? " at first we had a positive response , and now over the last 18 months things have really taken off , " @entity28 's managing director @entity46 told @entity0			2
" every region is interested -- @entity50 , @entity51 , the @entity52 -- and breeders have already used our test thousands of times			1
" @entity28 maintains a strict policy of confidentiality with its clients , but @entity46 did reveal that the first horses bred following speed - gene testing are already racing professionally			1
breeders are also offered the $ 1,500 " elite performance test , " which analyzes 54,000 genetic factors			1
while its results may not provide the meticulous levels of accuracy the " speed gene " test delivers , it categorizes how likely a horse is -- genetically speaking -- to win			1
" horses are placed within one of four class bands ; a class one would be 11 times better than a class four , " said @entity46			0
" the criteria obviously differ from subject to subject			0
with a sprint horse we would be looking at traits such as lactate metabolism and vascularization , whereas a horse with stamina we might analyze heart physiology and respiration			1
" @entity88 , turf columnist for " @entity89 " magazine and author of three books on the world of racing , dubbed the research as " almost the holy grail for breeders and trainers			1
" " for years they have searched for a way to remove the gamble inherent within breeding -- imagine , not having to fly mares all over the world , mating with all those different studs just trying to get the right results , " he said			1
another milestone for fantastic @entity43 at @entity108 in @entity112 , @entity110 farm in @entity111 has produced six former @entity112 champion sires since its foundation in 1867			1
it is the first breeder to include @entity28 's " speed gene " results in its stud brochures			1
" the test is certainly very interesting to us , " says @entity110 's general manager @entity120			1
" breeders have been searching for years for ways to do their job more efficiently , and there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle but this is certainly a key to unlocking it			1
" people have looked in - depth at hearts and other organs but have come and gone			0
these speed gene tests can help develop studies in the right direction			1
it 's worth keeping a close eye on			0
" however , @entity46 stresses that genetic research is only one piece of the puzzle of breeding winners			0
" genetics is only 35 - 55 % of the battle			0
the rest is down to the way the horse is raised , from insemination through to foaling to its upbringing and race training ; the aspects that will always be most important are not genetic , " he said			2
" we aim to guide the trainers and breeders , so they can correctly focus their efforts			1
" @entity46 insists @entity28 's work will not detract from the competitive spirit of the sport			0
" it is simply a tool to be utilized			0
it is ineffectual if not applied properly , " he said			0
" i can not see it taking away from the ' fun ' of the sport , as some have put it			0
" field agrees : " the idea of mating horses more efficiently has been around since the sport began			0
this discovery does nothing to detract from the competition			0
" @entity175 : from the horse 's mouth @entity112 's @entity178 and @entity179 has also utilized @entity28 's tests			1
but rather than breed its own horses it instead buys them as " tried " yearlings , often imported from all over the world			2
these horses are then raced internationally , predominantly in @entity186 and @entity187 as well as @entity112			1
as @entity178 's reputation , not to mention profits , rely on the performance of its yearlings , it needs to buy the right horses and send them to the correct trainer			1
" we were approached by a representative from their marketing team , " @entity178 co-owner and director @entity196 said of its relationship with @entity28			1
" i was fascinated by the science -- the sound logic and good research which they applied appealed to me			0
we made sure to do our own research to put their methods to the test			2
" we took 12 blood samples from 12 different horses and sent them for a blind testing at @entity28 -- this way they would have no idea if the blood was from a broken - down old mare or a champion sprinter			2
the correlations produced by their results gave us great confidence			2
" fame and fillies : meet the celebrity racehorse owners @entity196 says the professional racing community has reacted cautiously to @entity28 's research			0
" i was skeptical too at first			0
so much rubbish science is presented to the horse racing industry			2
so many ideas and tools claim to be unique but fail to deliver that professionals are gun - shy -- rarely is anything supported by the depth of research that @entity28 offer , " he said			0
@entity178 has not fully embraced the testing yet , but the company is at an " advanced testing " stage working towards a more complete relationship			1
" it 's very encouraging , but it 'll still be two to three years before our confidence is at 90 % - plus , " @entity196 said			0
" right now we 're testing half of our purchases			0
sometimes , what with the rate at which we complete transactions or because of contractual obligations , we do not have time to take the test			2
we do aim to test all of our domestic purchases , though			2
" the @entity257 @entity256 says such testing is " a commercial issue and it would not be appropriate for a regulatory body to comment			0
" @entity196 believes it poses no threat to the industry 's competitive balance			0
" this is no different to the developments made in breeding 100 years ago			0
innovations will always divide opinion -- it will be gospel to some and rubbish to others , " he said			0
" it 's the most significant development we 've seen in a while but it wo n't unbalance the playing field , that 's for sure			0

scientists discover " speed gene " within horse *dna* which *governs* physical ability
@entity284 allows trainers to learn what sort of *runner* their horse will develop into
thousands of breeders and trainers around the world have already taken the test
results of the test are already being published by @entity112 blood *stockist* @entity178
