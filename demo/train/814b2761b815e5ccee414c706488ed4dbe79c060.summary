a @entity1 state senator tried tuesday to block an abortion bill by attempting a 13 - hour filibuster , but appeared to fall short after 10 hours when the chairman ruled she had gone off topic			1
but a member of the @entity7 then moved that the ruling be appealed , and the status of the ruling was in doubt			0
@entity13 democrat @entity12 , 50 , took to the floor of the chamber late tuesday morning to criticize the bill , which would be among the nation 's most restrictive			1
rules called for her to stand , unaided , until midnight ( 1 a.m. wednesday et ) , for the filibuster to succeed			2
at the outset , @entity21 said she was speaking for families whose " personal relationships with their doctor and their creator " would be violated by the bill			1
" these voices have been silenced by a governor who made blind partisanship and personal political ambition the official business of our great state , " she said			1
" and sadly , he 's being abetted by legislative leaders who either share this blind partisanship or simply do not have the strength to oppose it			1
" @entity21 had a snack and a small amount of water before beginning , her office said			1
she was not allowed to lean or take a bathroom break			0
at about 10 p.m. ( 11 p.m. et ) , @entity21 talked about the abortion pill , @entity45 , and the chairman ruled that her comments were off topic			1
earlier in the evening , a fellow senator helped @entity21 put on a back brace , which angered some lawmakers who said it violated filibuster rules			1
that view was upheld in a vote , and she was given a warning			0
before that , she had been ruled off topic			0
@entity21 was allowed three warnings before the @entity7 was to be allowed to vote on whether she must stop her filibuster			2
the sneaker - wearing senator spent much of the time reading testimony and messages from women decrying the bill and recounting stories of the struggles they , their friends or relatives faced in the days before birth control and abortion were legalized			2
" women realize that these bills will not protect their heath , " she said			0
" they will only reduce their access to abortion providers and limit their ability to make their own family - planning decisions			0
" the bill would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and tighten standards on abortion clinics and the doctors who work at them			1
critics say it would shut most of the abortion clinics in @entity1			1
it has passed the state @entity91 , and gov. @entity93 , a former @entity94 presidential candidate , has said he 'll sign it			0
" in @entity1 , we value all life , and we 've worked to cultivate a culture that supports the birth of every child , " @entity93 said			0
" we have an obligation to protect unborn children , and to hold those who peddle these abortions to standards that would minimize the death , disease and pain they cause			0
" while @entity94 hold a majority in the @entity7 , they do n't appear to have the votes to thwart a filibuster			0
abortion rights advocates were rallying behind @entity21 online , pushing the hashtag # standwithwendy on @entity114			1
" like never before , people in @entity1 are standing up to demand that politicians respect women 's ability to make our own personal medical decisions , and the whole country is watching , " @entity115 , president of the @entity116 , said in a statement on the filibuster			2
@entity115 -- the daughter of former @entity1 gov. @entity126 -- said , " this bill is dangerous and deeply unpopular , and it will hurt a lot of women			0
we wo n't go back , we wo n't back down , and we wo n't forget when these politicians are on the ballot			0
" " partisanship and ambition are not unusual in a state capitol , but here , in @entity1 , right now , it has risen to a level of profound irresponsibility and the raw abuse of power , " she said in a statement on her website			1
@entity21 was elected to the @entity7 in 2008 , defeating a longtime @entity94 incumbent			2
last year , she staged a filibuster to force a special session in an attempt to stop $ 5 billion in cuts to @entity1 public schools , according to her website			0
@entity21 , who became a single mother at age 19 , went on to graduate with honors from @entity151 , it says .			2

sen. @entity12 said to have *digressed*
@entity21 would have had to hold the floor until midnight
" blind partisanship and personal political ambition " drive the bill , she says
critics say the law would shut most of the state 's abortion clinics
