-- former world champion @entity1 is one of @entity3 's big medal hopes for the @entity4			1
she has established herself as one of the top competitors in the seven - discipline heptathlon event , winning the gold medal at the @entity9 in @entity10			1
a year later she added the @entity11 to a growing list of accolades , as well as the @entity15 heptathlon crown			2
having started her senior athletics career in 2006 , @entity16 immediately made an impact by taking bronze in the heptathlon at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
@entity0 's human to @entity25 caught up with her during her preparations for her debut @entity28 in the @entity30 capital			1
early days " i started athletics when i was 10 years old			2
at that stage it was just a great opportunity to go and make loads of good friends , run around , do things and try events that i really enjoyed			2
" it was when i got to the age of about 14 - 15 that i got picked for my first @entity3 international and i saw a completely different side of athletics			2
something that was my hobby now had a really competitive side to it and i thought this is something i really want to do for a long time			1
" when i started i tried everything -- the coach i was with wanted me to keep my options open and try all the different events and see where my talent lay			2
he believed in me and believed i could be a good heptathelete so i decided to give them all a go			0
" heroes " i did n't particularly have one role model growing up			0
i remember watching a number of @entity30 athletes compete , it was a generation where every athlete was doing well -- @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 -- they inspired me			1
" but i 'm really inspired by the people around me			0
my family , my parents who introduced me to the sport and really got me where i am today			1
" career high " winning the gold medal at the ( 2009 ) world championships in @entity10 after the previous year missing the ( @entity73 ) @entity28 through injury			1
that was a real highlight of my career			1
" @entity16 ' tally of 6,731 points saw her finish 238 points ahead of second - placed @entity81 from @entity82 and 260 ahead of @entity84 's @entity83			0
career low " 2008 was a really tough year			1
i was in great shape and really looking forward to my first @entity28			0
then i picked up this injury that meant i would have to miss it			1
" it was a real disappointment			0
it was the first major injury i had had as an athlete and it made me questions a lot of things and i felt really unlucky and it was really , really disappointing			2
it was hard to get myself up after that			0
" in may 2008 , @entity16 withdrew from a heptathlon competition complaining of pain in her right foot			0
a scan revealed three stress fractures			0
sporting philosophy " as a sportsperson you have massive highs and lows throughout your career			2
but it 's having the people , the support around you to get through those low points and really enjoy the high points			0
you 've got to work for them , you 've got to expect that they are going to come			0
it 's just about working through ( low points ) because you always come out the other end and that makes ( winning ) that little more sweet			0
" @entity4 " it 's a very surreal year for all the @entity30 athletes , i think			1
it 's something we 've not experienced before and it 's going to be great			0

@entity30 heptathlete @entity1 is one of the favorites to take gold at the @entity4
