-- it was an ordinary day just before @entity2			1
i had arrived home after picking up my 3 - year - old daughter from school when i heard my phone ringing			1
i missed the first call from my father - in - law			1
i knew what he was calling about			1
i took the phone to my wife , @entity13 , and let her take the call			2
about 10 seconds into the conversation , she crumbled into a heap on the floor			1
fighting cancer with mustaches the test results were back			2
my father - in - law had been diagnosed with prostate cancer			2
we had feared this was going to come			2
he had shown some worrisome symptoms for a while , but nothing really prepares you for that moment			2
we cried , and i supported my wife the best i could			2
we talked about how we could help , being that we live in @entity31 and my in - laws live just outside @entity33			2
would we move ? would we take time off from work ? would we pay for a nurse to help him recover ? what will his treatment be ? how will it affect him ? will it make him better ? a few hours after being introduced to my father - in - law almost six years ago , i joined his family in riding in @entity43 several thousand fellow cyclists had taken to rush hour in downtown @entity33 to demonstrate that " we are traffic , too			1
" the cops shut the event down after a while			0
there i was , looking at the man who i knew would be my father - in - law , lifting his bicycle above his head , shouting " f * * * the police ! " i loved him instantly			0
the one thing i do know about his diagnosis : we will approach it with the same bluntness , energy and " stick - it - to - the - man " mentality that he has taken to every other challenge he 's had			1
he is due to have surgery soon , and the prognosis looks hopeful			0
i know this attitude will stand him in good stead for a full recovery			0
when we got that fateful phone call , i realized that we were only a couple of days away from @entity73 , the month when " @entity82 " everywhere join forces to grow ridiculous - looking mustaches in the name of raising awareness and funds for men 's health issues , specifically prostate and testicular cancer initiatives			1
it was a concept that seemed to fit perfectly			0
so i rummaged around the bathroom drawer for my long - lost razor			0
the last time i was completely bereft of facial hair was the night my daughter was born nearly four years ago			0
we were living in @entity89 at the time , and after 24 hours or so at the hospital , we were the proud parents of a 6 - pound baby girl			0
as my wife and our new bundle of joy slept , i rushed home to collect clothes for @entity13 and other sundries that had been forgotten in the rush to the hospital			0
i thought i would do the decent thing and clean myself up a bit before returning to the hospital in the morning			0
a shower and a shave , i thought			0
but i was so tired at that point that i did n't realize i had left the guard off my electric razor			0
i did n't recognize the person underneath			0
i 've had facial hair ever since , and it really felt strange to shave it off again for @entity73			1
it made me think about that night at the hospital and reminded me of the new sense of responsibility i felt to my daughter and wife			1
this time , that sense of responsibility comes from a different place			1
this time i feel an obligation to stand with my father - in - law , to support and honor him in the best and only way i know how			0
when people stop me at work and ask me why i shaved my beard off , i have a great excuse to talk about him and the type of man he is			1
it never fails to give me a spring in my step and a great sense of confidence , purpose and camaraderie			1
ultimately , i think that 's what @entity73 is all about .			1

@entity141 : @entity73 is a conversation *starter* about men 's health
he says it reminds him of family responsibility as much as it does of beards
@entity141 : " it never fails to give me ... a great sense of confidence "
