@entity0 , @entity1 -- a video of a teenage @entity1 mother beating her baby daughter has generated a storm of outrage online a year after it was filmed , prompting the @entity1 police to announce that the woman is already serving an 18 - month prison sentence for the offense			1
in a post on their @entity16 page this week , the @entity1 @entity8 said they had received hundreds of complaints and comments about the case after the four - minute video of the mother repeatedly striking the baby with her hand , her foot and a pillow went viral			1
the video fueled anger and disgust among internet users from @entity1 to @entity28 , where local news broadcaster @entity29 reported receiving " many emails " about the footage			2
the mother was 18 years old when she inflicted the beating on her 10 - month - old child in may 2011 , according to @entity36 , the chief of police in @entity38 , the suburb of @entity0 where the attack took place			1
a friend of the mother , who had become concerned after witnessing her beating the child previously , filmed the violence and took the video evidence to the police the same day , @entity36 said			1
as a result , the mother was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 18 months in prison , he said , declining to disclose her name			2
attempts to obtain comment from the mother or a representative for her were unsuccessful friday			0
the baby was put into the care of a foster family after her mother 's arrest and is now doing " very well , " said @entity60 , deputy director of the children division of the @entity62			1
welfare officials check in every month with the foster family , who are unconnected to the family of the mother , @entity60 said			1
the initial furor this week among @entity69 users over the video appeared to stem from uncertainty about when the beating took place and the current status of the mother and child			1
once the @entity1 @entity8 clarified the situation , online reactions consisted of relief that the authorities had intervened and dismay that the mother had not received a harsher sentence			1
" good to hear police immediately took action and thanks for clearing the air , " a @entity16 user named @entity85 said in a comment on the police 's page , adding that he thought the sentence was too light			2
" she 's lucky that did n't happen here in the @entity97 , " said another @entity16 user , @entity94			0
" not only would her sentence be a whole lot longer , she probably would n't have made it to prison to serve her time and would never be able to hurt another child again			2
" a court will assess whether the mother , who is to be released in late november , will be allowed to regain custody of the child , should she wish to , @entity60 said , adding that the process is rigorous			0
@entity36 , the police chief , refuted speculation that the mother had been raped before committing the abuse			0
he said the woman was unmarried			0
he ascribed the cause of her actions to " frustration			0
" it was unclear why the video had surfaced online a year after the event			2
the police are investigating the leak of the video , @entity36 said			0
