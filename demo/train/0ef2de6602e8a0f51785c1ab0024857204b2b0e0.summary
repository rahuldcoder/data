@entity0 -- @entity3 attorney general @entity2 said friday his office is looking into requests by lawmakers to investigate @entity7 , the multinational media conglomerate run by @entity8			1
@entity7 is embroiled in a phone hacking scandal in the @entity10 that forced one of its top executives , @entity13 , to resign friday			1
now , @entity3 legislators say they want to know if the company engaged in that illegal activity in the @entity3			2
" there have been serious allegations raised in that regard in @entity24 , there is an ongoing investigation , " @entity2 told reporters in @entity18 , @entity19			1
" there have been members of @entity28 in the @entity3 who have asked us to investigate those same allegations			0
and we are progressing in the regard using the appropriate federal agencies in the @entity3			1
" the @entity33 has launched an investigation into @entity7 after a report that the company 's employees or associates may have attempted to hack into phone conversations and voice mail boxes of september 11 survivors , victims and their families , a federal law enforcement source told @entity1 thursday			1
" we are aware of the allegations and are looking into them , " said the source , who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation			1
" we 'll be looking at anyone acting for or on behalf of @entity7 , from the top down to janitors , " to gather information and determine whether any laws may have been broken			1
because the investigation just began , it 's too early to say when the first interviews will be conducted , the source said , adding the probe is a " high priority			1
" rep. @entity61 , @entity63 - @entity62 , earlier this week asked fbi director @entity64 to investigate the possibility that journalists working for @entity8 may have tapped into the phones of 9/11 victims and relatives			1
@entity7 said thursday it had no comment on the @entity33 investigation or the possibility of congressional hearings			1
meanwhile , @entity7 boss @entity8 said in an interview thursday with the @entity76 newspaper -- one of @entity7 's own publications -- that he felt the company had handled the crisis " extremely well in every way possible			1
" he told the newspaper he had decided to appear before @entity10 politicians next tuesday , after initially declining to attend the hearing , because he wanted to address " some of the things that have been said in @entity86 , some of which are total lies			0
we think it 's important to absolutely establish our integrity in the eyes of the public ... i felt it 's best just to be as transparent as possible			2
" @entity8 told the @entity76 that @entity7 would establish its own independent committee , to be led by a " distinguished non-employee , " " to investigate every charge of improper conduct " and to draw up a " protocol for behavior " for the company 's new reporters			1
those new reporters wo n't be working for @entity105			0
the chief executive of @entity107 , the subsidiary that runs @entity7 's @entity10 print media , resigned friday in the wake of the scandal			1
@entity105 , who was editor of @entity111 at the time of some of the most serious allegations against the newspaper , has been under pressure to step down since the allegations began			0
in a statement released through @entity107 , she said : " as chief executive of the company , i feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt and i want to reiterate how sorry i am for what we now know to have taken place ... while it has been a subject of discussion , this time my resignation has been accepted			2
" concerns over the hacking of phones belonging to 9/11 victims and relatives appear to be traceable to a story published wednesday by the @entity137 , a @entity10 tabloid that includes a section it describes as " gossip gone toxic			0
" the newspaper cited " a source " who referred to a former police officer who now works as a private investigator			2
" the investigator is used by a lot of journalists in @entity3 and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims ' private phone data , " the source reportedly told the newspaper			2
the source told the @entity137 the request came from @entity111 , the newspaper at the center of the phone - hacking scandal in @entity24			2
" he said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives , " the newspaper said			0
" his presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voice mails , just like has been shown they have done in the @entity10			0
the @entity169 said he had to turn the job down			0
he knew how insensitive such research would be , and how bad it would look			0
" the investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the @entity10 victims of the attacks			0
" relatives of the victims of the terrorist attacks expressed outrage over the possibility they may have been hacking victims			0
what they went through is " heartfelt stuff , and it should n't be out there for all to see unless the family approves , " said @entity189 , a retired @entity190 deputy chief who lost a son in the attacks			0
" until we get some accountability , they 're just going to keep doing it , " @entity189 said			0
" it 's completely unethical , unprofessional and basically criminal			2
" @entity197 , who also lost a son in the attacks , called it " very horrifying that privacy and personal security could be violated in such an egregious manner			0
" " i would hold these people accountable and responsible , " she told @entity1 thursday			2
" someone has to defend the dead			0
" @entity208 sen. @entity207 of @entity209 said the september 11 families have " suffered enough " and deserve answers			0
@entity8 has one prominent @entity3 politician , who was praised for his leadership following the 9/11 attacks , coming to his defense , saying @entity8 may have been unaware of what was going on			2
" give people the presumption of innocence , " former @entity62 mayor @entity217 told @entity1 's @entity218 in @entity219 on thursday			1
" i think that just how high up it goes is a big question and one we should n't be jumping to conclusions about			0
" @entity8 and @entity217 are longtime friends			1
also , a law and lobbying firm in which @entity217 is partner received $ 100,000 in lobbying fees from @entity7 in 2005 , according to congressional disclosure filings			1
@entity111 , a 168 - year - old @entity10 newspaper owned by @entity8 , folded over the weekend in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims , politicians and celebrities			2
police in the @entity10 have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking			0
there also were allegations that reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers			0
on wednesday , several senators sent letters to @entity2 , asking him to look into concerns that @entity7 violated the @entity250			1

potential liability flows from journalists at @entity111 to its parent , @entity107 , and to its parent , @entity7 , which is a publicly held company in the @entity3 , and runs @entity261			1
