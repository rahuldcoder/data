editor 's note : @entity2 hosts " @entity3 " from 5 - 7 p.m. et mondays through fridays on @entity4			1
" @entity3 " uses the day 's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives , spirited debate and your points of view			2
@entity2 says parents should help teens make decisions about emergency contraceptives			1
@entity16 , @entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- in a matter of weeks , teenage girls , just 17 years old , will be able to get their hands on the " morning after pill " without ever talking to a doctor and without their parents ever knowing or being a part of this major decision			2
think of a 17 - year - old girl			2
most of the time she 's a high school senior , still living at home with @entity32			2
she still needs her parents in the tough times			2
but they will be cut out of a traumatic situation			0
all thanks to @entity38 district judge @entity37			0
@entity37 stated in his order , " the record shows that @entity42 officials and staff both agreed that 17 - year - olds can use @entity45 safely without a prescription			1
" now keep in mind birth control pills require a doctor 's prescription , but a drug that is more powerful does n't ? the effective ingredient in @entity45 is the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel and this is also found in daily oral contraceptives			1
some forms of birth control that require a prescription have levonorgestrel , while @entity45 has significantly more of the synthetic hormone			1
do we really want our daughters putting something like this in their bodies without a doctor ? i still want @entity32 in on this			0
some argue that a girl can get an abortion without parental notification in some states , so why not @entity45 ? but just because those states got it wrong by leaving parents out of the loop does n't mean others should follow suit			1
and the larger point is , society must help parents , not undermine their rights by keeping them in the dark on their child 's life - changing decision			1
here 's some perspective for you : in most states , minors ca n't get a tattoo , body piercings or go to a tanning salon without a parent 's permission , but we are going to leave them alone to take @entity45 the " morning after pill , " or @entity45 , is 89 percent effective in preventing pregnancy when it 's taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex			1
it 's no surprise that @entity101 applauds the now broader access to this drug , calling it " a strong statement to @entity38 women that their health comes before politics			0
" i question that , when we are cutting a doctor out of the decision to administer a powerful drug			0
timing is essential to the drug 's effectiveness , @entity45 supporters say , so getting parents and doctors involved would unnecessarily delay the teen 's ability to pop the pill the " morning after			1
" does it really take that long to get a prescription ? i also do n't buy the argument that this will help with unplanned pregnancies and abortions			2
the @entity126 says making @entity45 more widely available could reduce them , but the @entity127 reports that since 18 - year - olds were allowed to get @entity45 without a prescription in 2006 , there has been no evidence of it having an effect on the country 's teen pregnancy or abortion rates			1
but let 's get back to the first point : we are making it available to high school girls			0
we 're enabling teenagers to act carelessly with an easy way out			0
during a recent discussion on my show , @entity147 , supervising producer of the web site @entity150 , said it best			0
" teenagers are known for thinking they 're untouchable and here we are saying that they can continue to do that and that there are n't any consequences			0
" with @entity45 , they can do it now and deal with it later			1
do n't tell me high school dynamics wo n't play in here			0
the boyfriend will talk his girlfriend into unprotected sex with the promise of buying the " morning after pill " the next day			0
any 17 - year - old boy will be able to buy this drug , just as any 17 - year - old girl will			0
yes , this could encourage unprotected sex and that means a greater risk for sexually transmitted diseases			0
what about the 17 - year - old girl who may get @entity45 for her 15 - year - old sophomore friend ? these are the kind of decisions high school girls will make			1
@entity37 did n't stop there			0
he asked the @entity42 to consider making @entity45 available to girls of any age			1
that 's a slippery slope and what 's worse , the ones who will fall are our daughters			0
think of a 14 - year - old girl taking @entity45 without the love , support and guidance of parents and without the medical supervision of a doctor			1
yes , teens have sex and difficult situations will arise , but should we open the door for our girls to go through this alone ? that is not what is best for our daughters			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : mom and dad should help teens make decisions about @entity45
he also says society must support parents , not undermine their rights
@entity2 : if birth control requires a prescription , so should @entity45
