-- researchers have raised the alert status at @entity3 , a volcano in southern @entity4 , after another increase in seismic activity			1
seismic activity at @entity4 's @entity3 again has scientists watching for an eruption			1
" shallow earthquake activity under the volcano has been as high as 26 events per 10 - minute period , " officials at the @entity11 said sunday in a statement announcing that the alert level was raised to " watch " status			1
although no eruption has occurred , the scientists said the increase in seismic activity " likely represents either the upward movement of magma or pressurization of the system			2
" " it is possible for unrest at the volcano to change rapidly , and seismic activity or other signs of unrest could escalate culminating in an eruption within days to weeks , " the statement concluded			1
an increase in seismic activity at the same volcano prompted a " watch " level last monday			2
in the @entity41 's color - coded alert levels , the orange " watch " level means the volcano " is exhibiting heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption " or that " eruption is underway with no or minor volcanic - ash emissions			0
" the next level is red , meaning an eruption is imminent or underway			0

@entity3 last erupted nearly 20 years ago , in december 1989			2
that eruption lasted until april 1990 .			0
