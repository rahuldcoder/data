-- as the @entity2 came into view tuesday morning , @entity1 tried to help his neighbor @entity4 navigate their car into @entity7			1
he 's a 43 - year - old software consultant			1
she 's a mother of four			2
a week ago , they lived in a town and a neighborhood they thought was safe			2
now their block in @entity15 is set off by caution tape			2
inside a house 100 yards from @entity4 's front door , @entity15 was found in her bed on friday , a gunshot to her face			1
the killer , her 20 - year - old son , @entity24 , took three of his mother 's high - powered guns to @entity28 and murdered 20 first - graders and six adults			1
" i can not even tell you what that feels like to have that happen in your town			2
it was like we were grabbing for something , anything , " said @entity1			2
on friday night , neighbors and friends starting calling each other			1
" we all thought we have to do something , " he said			2
" that turned into , ' what are you doing saturday ? can we get people together saturday ? ' " remembering the victims about 50 people got together saturday , then sunday and again monday at the town 's public library , the only place that could accommodate the growing crowd of 75 - plus people			1
they decided to call themselves @entity57			1
a @entity59 and @entity60 account were set up			2
then they scrambled to find people in the group who could drop their jobs for a day or put off family obligations to go to @entity7			1
the @entity66 , which holds perhaps the biggest pro-gun control megaphone in the country , was staging a press conference at the capital			1
@entity1 , @entity4 and @entity4 's 16 - year - old daughter , @entity71 , just wanted to be a part of that , if only to stand and listen			1
they get that they 're entering a foreign , complex and often ugly world of politics and ideology			2
" maybe that sounds like a pipe dream , and maybe that 's arrogant , " said @entity1			2
" but why not ? if we fail , and maybe we will , but we do n't know if we do n't try			2
" so many victims , a long fight at the press conference , more than 40 relatives of people who have been victims of gun violence spoke			1
one after another , they approached the microphone : -- mothers of an 8 - year - old and a 27 - year - old killed in the @entity95 , @entity96 , movie theater shootings this july			1
-- a man who talked about his sister who was shot to death in a classroom in 2007 at @entity102 -- a mother who held a picture of her 16 - year - old son , gunned down the same year on a bus in @entity107			1
-- the sons of a member of the @entity110 in @entity111 where a gunman murdered six in august			2
-- the mother of a little girl killed in the @entity116 , @entity117 , shooting that targeted former @entity119 rep. @entity118			2
@entity120 , the father of @entity121 , who was one of 13 people killed at @entity124 in @entity96 in 1999 , walked to the podium			2
he had on worn , gray sneakers			2
" i am here today wearing my son 's shoes , " he said			0
" it 's amazing we have the same size shoes so i wear them , because he was a member of the debate team at @entity124 , so i now wear his shoes in this great debate and it 's a debate we need to have in this country			0
" @entity120 knows what he 's talking about			0
he 's dedicated the past 13 years to urging politicians to pass stricter gun laws			1
experts say the effort has been largely unsuccessful			0
part of the reason for that rests with the troubled ban on assault weapons that passed in 1994 and was due to last 10 years			0
it expired in 2004 during president @entity150 's administration			0
the specifics of that ban were complicated , critics said , which allowed for numerous loopholes			0
it also only applied to new gun purchases			1
further , gun - control advocates are up against the @entity158 , which has 4 million members in the @entity119			1
this year , the @entity158 spent $ 17 million on federal elections			1
annual gun sales in the @entity119 total about $ 3.5 billion , according to @entity162			1
" it 's not like the @entity158 represents some tiny splinter of @entity119 culture , " said @entity163 , author of " @entity164 : the rise of @entity119 's @entity169			1
" " the liberal argument is that the @entity158 distorts democracy or bullies politicians			1
they do n't speak for cosmopolitan circles on the @entity177 or @entity178 or the mayor of big cities , " he said			0
" they do n't speak for populations of people who are affected by urban crime			0
but they do speak for many , many people who have guns and do n't want those guns taken from them			0
" @entity163 said he feels compassion for everyone in @entity15			0
but @entity57 is entering a fight tougher than they could possibly fathom at this stage , he added			0
" they are entering into a very ideologically charged arena , and are going to run up against a very cynical , very complicated and well - practiced maelstrom , " he said			1
" i wish them the best but i would be surprised if they do n't end up quite disillusioned having watched this process			0
" @entity158 breaks silences after shootings start with talking @entity1 appreciates that			1
neither he nor @entity4 have had the time in the past 72 hours to dive into the language of the ban on assault weapons , they said			0
but they want to , and intend to			0
while @entity1 said @entity57 wants to also address loopholes in mental health care and making schools safer , he stressed that the group generally is focused on one objective			0
they think it 's achievable in the short - term			1
they want to sit down and talk to people who support gun rights			1
" we have to sit down as adults and have an open dialogue and listen to that other person and find that middle ground , " @entity1 told @entity0			0
at least two politicians who were for gun rights , @entity227 sens. @entity226 of @entity228 and @entity229 of @entity228 , said they would weigh supporting new proposed limits on firearms			1
the @entity158 has been silent , though tuesday afternoon it announced it will hold a press conference friday			1
its @entity59 page has been deactivated , and visitors are redirected to a bare - bones page where comments are disabled ( although " likes " are still allowed )			1
its @entity60 account , which typically posts several times a day , also has been quiet			0
the group 's last tweet , on friday morning , was a promotional message that said , " 10 days of @entity241 -- enter today for a chance to win an auto emergency tool ! " @entity15 shooter 's guns : what we know an advocate for @entity15 ? @entity1 said there 's hope within @entity251 that they 'll have a major prizefighter in their corner -- sen. @entity256 , @entity257			1
she was one of the major backers of the 1994 assault weapons ban			0
@entity256 said she 'll introduce the bill when @entity261 reconvenes in january and the same legislation will also be proposed in the @entity263			0
it will ban the sale , transfer , importation and possession of big clips , drums or strips that contain more than 10 bullets , she said			0
she added the caveat that " 900 specific weapons " ... " will not fall under the bill			0
" president @entity275 , she believes , will support the legislation			1
back in @entity7 , @entity4 is weary but optimistic			1
" look at those beautiful babies , " the mother said , her voice shaking			0
" look at those children at @entity15			0
i just want to tell people in @entity7 to do what is right			1
so is her daughter @entity71			0
the teenager 's school was in lockdown on friday			2
when she got home later in the day , all she could do was hug her parents			0
she casually says , " the next time my school is on lockdown , " perhaps not realizing that she thinks there will be another time , no matter the circumstances , when a school is afraid			0
" i trust the teachers in my school and the faculty , especially after seeing how they reacted , " she said			0
" but i 'm worried that everyone is going to be terrified			0
" i know kids around the world feel the same way			0
they are going to know that this could happen to them			0
i just want to be a part of trying to change that			0
