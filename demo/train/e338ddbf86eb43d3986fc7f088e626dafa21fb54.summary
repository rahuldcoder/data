-- sports are not pretty			1
and firing @entity3 basketball coach @entity2 will not take the brutality out of college sports			1
it does not change a thing			0
even in these politically correct times , the essence of sport will always lie in the @entity11 within us all			1
watching the video of @entity2 batter and berate his players , i recalled the dozens of other times i 'd witnessed similar scenes , at my son 's @entity20 games , at playground pick - up games			1
and i thought immediately of watching coaches like @entity24 and @entity25			0
the video highlights are not easy to watch , but they do not tell the whole story			0
" yes he went overboard			0
but you ca n't get a good feeling for what went down by seeing highlights on @entity33			1
no one was scared of coach @entity2			1
we did n't fear him			1
we just understood him , " @entity36 , who played for @entity2 from 2010 - 11 , told @entity38 's @entity37			1
opinion : @entity3 coach and sports ' bully culture indeed , the world today is in a better , more enlightened place , where it 's not nice to call people obscene or homophobic names			1
where slapping people upside the head , beaning them with a basketball or giving them a swift kick in the rear is not considered the best motivational tactic			0
but the sports nation has not quite caught up with the rest of this kinder , gentler world			1
frankly , i do n't think it should -- not completely anyway			2
that may be hard to understand for some people			0
but no one who has been up close to sports can honestly be shocked by @entity2 's coaching techniques			1
he is not an anomaly -- especially in the win - at - all - costs , big - money world of college sports			2
he just got caught on video , and we must react			0
we can debate whether bully - coaching is an effective motivational tool			0
but there 's no debate that it is practiced throughout sports , from @entity79 on up			1
for most fans , sports are a feel - good experience that teaches life lessons : how to lead , how to lose , how to push yourself to your highest potential			1
i watched in amazement as my son evolved from a shy , awkward , oversized boy to a strong , confident leader			0
the change began when he fell in love with basketball at a young age			2
did he have tyrannical coaches ? yes , one			0
his @entity20 coach was a terror			2
yelling the entire practice , he often degraded his 10 - year - old boys			0
he told them they were nothings , just little black boys who would probably end up dead or in prison before 21			0
he screamed , eyes bulging , that without basketball they 'd be nothing			0
he shoved them , when he thought no one was looking			0
and who knows what he said to his team when parents were n't within listening distance			1
so , his father and i always stayed close by , just in case things got out of hand			0
my son thought his coach was weird and angry			2
many of the kids on the team were private - school , college - bound black boys			2
coach was still stereotyping them			2
for @entity123 , it was a rough , racist world and the boys might as well toughen up early			0
his team got blown out every game , but my son never wanted to quit			1
i remember asking a few of the pro athletes i worked with if i should take my son off the team			1
they said " absolutely not			0
" it would be a good lesson for my son			2
" you play the game for love of the game , you will not love all of your coaches , " one @entity134 told me			1
turns out , they had all experienced a @entity24 type of coach			2
and the athletes argued that it was important for a young man to learn not to let a bully coach like that break you			1
they said it was their worst coaches who prepared them for the bullies they met later in life , on the court and in their corporate offices			2
@entity2 never pretended to be a gentle leader			1
it was his brutal passion for the game , in part , that led @entity3 's athletic director @entity160 to hire @entity2 to coach the @entity161			1
" i knew exactly what i was getting and i still know what i 've got , " @entity160 said when he hired @entity2			1
" @entity164 with an edge			0
that personality is ideal for our program here in @entity38			0
" d - 1 basketball is big time			0
@entity2 and his team were under pressure to produce wins and prove they belonged in the big leagues			1
that 's why @entity2 was n't fired when the video was first shown to the athletic director			1
he was suspended for three games and fined $ 50,000			0
but the story did n't end there			2
it took the threat of a wrongful termination lawsuit by @entity186 , an @entity187 player and a former director of player development for the @entity161 , who complained to @entity160 about @entity2 's outrageous behavior			1
@entity186 got fired for his concerns , according to his attorney , @entity193			0
then the video was released to the media			0
the school decided the story was just too hot to explain -- best to dump the coach and avoid a public relations mess			2
it was a knee - jerk solution , a marketing move			0
but do n't think for one minute that @entity2 wo n't find a way to rehabilitate his reputation			1
he 'll go to anger management classes			0
his peers will say he 's a changed man			2
he 'll show remorse to the media			0
then he 'll be back coaching in the college game in no time at all			2
brutes will always have a seat at the sports table			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 : firing @entity2 wo n't make a *difference* : sports appeals to our @entity11 side
@entity221 : every athlete has had a " coach @entity2 , " who bullies and berates team members
@entity221 : athletes say it 's good to get tough ; you play for the love of the game , not the coach
@entity221 : @entity2 did n't pretend to be gentle . his brutal passion was one reason he was hired
