the @entity0 on narrow grounds struck down a @entity3 law thursday creating no - protest " buffer zones " on public property surrounding health clinics that perform abortions			1
in what is a free speech dispute that touched on the larger political and social controversy over abortion , the court ruled unanimously			0
it did not strike down all such laws , but the ruling gives room for the state to go back and craft new , less restrictive protest zones			1
" here the commonwealth has pursued those interests by the extreme step of closing a substantial portion of a traditional public forum to all speakers , " said chief justice @entity19			0
" it has done so without seriously addressing the problem through alternatives that leave the forum open for its time - honored purposes			0
" @entity3 officials said the issue was more about public safety and pedestrian access on local sidewalks			1
anti-abortion supporters countered that their first amendment rights were violated			1
the decision could affect a broader range of free speech areas -- over issues such as war , taxes , corporate bailouts and elections -- where the location of the message is often key to its effectiveness			0
eleven women 's health clinics across @entity3 are covered by the fixed buffer zones			1
the current state law strengthened earlier restrictions that had created a floating 6 - foot protective bubble around clinic patrons approaching the facility			1
abortion rights supporters said it was ineffective , since they claimed it led to blocked entrances and a gauntlet of protesters surrounding patients and staff			2
some past anti-abortion protests have turned violent in the @entity65			0
the state 's 2007 revised " selective exclusion law " makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic " employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment " to " enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk " within 35 feet of " a reproductive health care facility			2
" anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from effectively talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances			2
demonstrators have appeared regularly at clinics in @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88 and say they are unfairly singled out for exclusion on public property			1
four more conservative justices would have taken the ruling further , saying the law was discriminatory , and that state should not be given the opportunity to go back and adopt new rules at selected facilities			1
" the obvious purpose of the challenged portion of the @entity100 is to ' protect ' prospective clients of abortion clinics from having to hear abortion - opposing speech on public streets and sidewalks , " said justice @entity97			2
" the provision is thus unconstitutional root and branch and can not be saved , as the majority suggests , by limiting its application to the single facility that has experienced the safety and access problems to which it is quite obviously not addressed			2
" the last time the high court took a close look at the issue was in 2000 , upholding @entity119 's broad " no approach zone " regulations			0
municipalities in @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and elsewhere have since enacted similar " fixed " and " floating " buffer zone laws for clinics			0
those laws will now have to be revisited in light of thursday 's opinion			0
the sidewalk outside the @entity0 itself is the scene of daily anti-abortion protests sponsored by @entity134 , where mostly young @entity136 adults stand silent wearing red tape across their mouths with the handwritten word " life			0
