-- @entity1 has been a desktop computer staple for decades , and now it looks like it might finally migrate to modern touchscreen tablets			1
but does @entity7 's mouse - and keyboard - dependent productivity software even belong on a tablet ? and if it does make the transition to touch , how will we actually use it ? yesterday , a report by staff of @entity15 claimed that @entity1 for @entity17 apps are definitely in the works , and could be released " in the coming weeks			1
" the story included photos and descriptions of a purported hands - on demo			2
@entity7 representatives were quick to shoot back both on @entity25 and in an official statement stating @entity15 had its facts wrong and that its reporters had not , in fact , seen an actual @entity7 product on the tablet			2
nonetheless , the @entity15 's @entity32 later insisted that a working version of the app was demoed to the digital publication by a @entity7 employee			0
it 's a he - said - she - said situation , but at least one key industry watcher feels @entity41 for @entity17 makes sense			1
" i can say that based on the products @entity7 currently has in the market , launching additional office apps for @entity50 devices would be a logical extension of their existing strategy , " @entity44 analyst @entity43 told @entity0 in an e-mail			0
@entity7 already has @entity55 and @entity56 products like @entity1 , a note - taking app called @entity58 , @entity59 for cloud storage , and @entity61 , points out @entity43			1
rumors that @entity7 would be bringing @entity41 to the @entity17 have been circulating for a while , particularly since @entity15 reported in late november that the suite would arrive in early 2012 at a $ 10 price point			1
if what the @entity15 reported tuesday is true , it 's possible that @entity68 could land concurrent to -- or even onstage with -- @entity50 's first public @entity17 demo , which is expected to be held the first week of march			1
it would certainly make for an interesting presentation , as @entity50 does n't actively evangelize its @entity7 synergy			2
@entity7 will be demoing its @entity74 consumer preview on feb. 29 so the timing of an early @entity41 for @entity17 unveiling would seem to work : @entity7 's big platform - wide announcement would n't be upstaged by its smaller @entity50 announcement			1
so let 's assume @entity41 is coming to the @entity17			1
how precisely will you use it ? " you 'll use it for content curation			0
and it 's very unlikely you 'll be using the @entity17 in native tablet touch mode , " @entity85 , ceo of @entity86 , told @entity0			1
@entity86 is a cloud platform that lets you access your desktop and its files -- including @entity91 and @entity1 -- with a touch - controlled mouse pointer as input			1
" in most cases , you 'll have it docked into a screen or a keyboard , " @entity85 said of the rumored @entity41 app. however , a second use case -- passively browsing through documents -- definitely lends itself to the @entity17 's simple touch - controlled data input			1
and do n't underestimate the value of full document support			2
by loading native office docs directly into @entity41 , you ensure files render with proper formatting , a talent not always manifest in competitors like documents to go premium			0
in this case , " the pure gesture - based control works great , " @entity85 said			0
" it translates to a tablet experience			0
" ok , so @entity85 paints an interesting picture of how the app will be used , but , again , is there a desperate need for @entity41 on the @entity17 ? many of us have been getting by just fine without it			2
well , according to @entity123 , 18 % of those who decided not to purchase an @entity17 2 did so strictly because it did n't come with @entity1 programs			1
that 's not a number to balk at			0
@entity85 thinks students and small businesses will be interested in @entity130			1
and there 's also another prime user group : people who do n't want to spend money on multiple devices			2
" if they can cross-utilize devices to also do productivity , thats a huge cost savings , " @entity85 said			0
@entity140 of @entity123 concurs with @entity85			0
" tablets are a critical dual - purpose device , " @entity141 told @entity0 , adding that close to 70 % of personal tablet users also use their devices for business			2
indeed , the @entity17 has a growing role in the world of enterprise computing , with a large percent of @entity152 companies adopting the tablet ( this was a touch point in @entity50 ceo @entity155 's recent first - quarter earnings call )			1
so , no doubt , the addition of @entity1 to the enterprise mix would be welcome			2
but @entity7 has waited a long time to deliver this product -- perhaps too long			0
" every day that @entity7 does not have office apps for @entity17 , they lose potential sales to competitors , " @entity43 said			2
such competitors include : @entity50 's own @entity166 office suite ; @entity167 , an @entity169 alternative for viewing , sharing and editing @entity1 documents ; and @entity172 , an @entity17 - based powerpoint platform			1
@entity43 pointed out that these and a host of other productivity apps are all top performers in @entity50 's @entity177			0
indeed , @entity50 's @entity180 ( in other words , the @entity166 suite ) make up three of the top five spots in the @entity182 for paid productivity apps in the @entity177			0
and with @entity187 's heavy @entity186 integration , using @entity50 's @entity166 suite will make even more sense for users who own multiple @entity50 products			0
whether people who already use office alternatives would switch to @entity7 - brand products is " hard to say for sure , " says @entity141			0
" i think in the enterprise many still believe ' @entity41 is @entity195 ' and will come back			0
" regardless , if @entity68 did make its debut onstage for the @entity17 3 in a few weeks , it would be the first time the two tech giants teamed up at an @entity50 event in 15 years			1
considering what happened last time , it would be a landmark occasion			0
