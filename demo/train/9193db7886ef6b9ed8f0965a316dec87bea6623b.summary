-- a @entity2 report says @entity3 , the world 's biggest producer of opium , is also a " major producer of cannabis " and " the world 's biggest producer of hashish			1
" the @entity12 on drugs and @entity14 issued its @entity15 on wednesday , documenting large - scale cannabis cultivation in half of @entity3 's 34 provinces			2
" while other countries have even larger cannabis cultivation , the astonishing yield of the @entity3 cannabis crop -- 145 kilograms per hectare of hashish , the resin produced from cannabis , as compared to around 40 kilograms per hectare in @entity33 -- makes @entity3 the world 's biggest producer of hashish , estimated at between 1,500 and 3,500 tons a year , " said @entity19 , @entity20 's executive director , in a report issued at the agency 's headquarters in @entity24 , @entity25			1
the survey results reflect the significance of @entity3 's illicit drug trade , exploited by militants to fund their operations in unstable areas , such as the country 's war - torn southern region			1
in 2008 , " a massive seizure of cannabis -- 245,000 kilograms -- was made in @entity47 near the @entity49 border			0
" " all drugs in @entity3 , whether opium or cannabis , are taxed by those who control the territory , providing an additional source of revenue for insurgents , " @entity19 said			1
the study said the high concentration of cannabis cultivation in the south " marks a shift away from the north , which even five years ago , was the main cannabis - growing region			0
illustrative of this trend is the steep increase in cannabis prices in @entity70 " because of a crackdown since 2007			0
the report says money " is one of the main reasons " for large - scale cannabis cultivation			0
" the gross income per hectare of cannabis ( us $ 3,900 ) is higher than from opium ( us $ 3,600 )			0
cannabis does not need much labor cost : in @entity3 it is three times cheaper to cultivate a hectare of cannabis than a hectare of opium			2
" as a result , the net income of a hectare of cannabis is us $ 3,341 compared to us $ 2,005 per hectare of opium			0
in the aggregate , however , because opium cultivation far exceeds cannabis cultivation , in 2009 the value of cannabis resin production in @entity3 was estimated at between us $ 39 - 94 million , about 10 - 20 percent of the farmgate value of opium production			2
" @entity19 said the report shows that @entity3 's drug problem " is even more complex than just the opium trade			1
" " reducing @entity3 's cannabis supply should be dealt with more seriously as part of the national drug control strategy			1
as with opium , the bottom line is to improve security and development in drug - producing regions in order to wean farmers off of illicit crops and into sustainable , licit livelihoods , and to deny insurgents another source of illicit income			0
