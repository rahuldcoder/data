-- the trial of mass murderer @entity2 has confirmed one thing so far : he seems quite mad			1
looking plump and dumb , with a slightly receding hairline , the @entity4 gave a right - wing salute as he entered the courtroom and smirked his way through @entity10 footage of his handiwork			2
@entity2 claims that he killed 77 people as an act of self - defense against the @entity15 of @entity4 , that he is a member of the @entity16 and part of an " anticommunist " resistance to multiculturalism			1
reading his insane manifesto , it is tempting to dismiss him as a nut with a gun			0
nevertheless , there 's no denying the political context to what @entity2 did			1
since 9/11 , fringe and mainstream politicians in @entity29 and @entity30 have spoken of @entity31 as incompatible with @entity33 values			1
@entity2 quoted many of them in his manifesto			1
this is not to say that he took direct inspiration from those public figures , or that they bear personal responsibility for his crimes			0
but @entity2 's paranoia does conform to a popular -- wholly negative -- view of the twin problems of @entity31 and multiculturalism			1
tragically , it is a view that few mainstream politicians have been willing to challenge			0
@entity2 makes two false claims			1
the first is that @entity31 is ethically inferior to @entity50 and can not exist peacefully within the secular democracies of the @entity52			1
that is the open view of the @entity54 , the @entity55 , the @entity56 and the @entity58 @entity57			0
it was implicit in @entity62 presidential candidate @entity61 's aversion to the building of mosques			0
we might also infer it from much of the testimony presented at rep. @entity69 's congressional hearings into the radicalization of @entity30 @entity72 youth			0
@entity69 has opined that there are " too many mosques " in the @entity30 and that roughly 80 % of @entity30 @entity72 are radical			0
the mistake being made by all these people is to conflate a tiny minority of political @entity31 -- whose precise ideology has only really emerged in the last 30 years -- with the entire global and historical community of @entity72			1
it is true that @entity31 has never undergone a total reformation , but it has experienced mini-enlightenments			1
the most celebrated is the @entity83 ( 750 - 1258 ) , centered in @entity84 , in which the arts and sciences flourished in a manner that left @entity88 far behind			0
( you can also find humanist poetry and art in @entity92 and even a small amount of erotica in @entity95			0
) @entity31 never outright rejected scientific empiricism but instead tried to reconcile and integrate it into its religious beliefs , with a surprising amount of debate about the primacy of either faith or reason			1
it preached that divine revelation could be found in other religions and so practiced tolerance in the lands that it conquered -- a kind of @entity31 multiculturalism			1
one of the giants of the @entity111 , @entity112 , favorably opined that @entity31 was more tolerant in its treatment of minorities than @entity50 ( consider the comparative persecution of @entity116 in @entity117 or of @entity118 in @entity119 )			1
today , @entity31 society looks different in every region where it is found			2
the royal families of @entity123 have promoted ultra-conservative @entity124 , which discourages personal vice , idolatry , veneration of saints , etc. the @entity130 prefer the more mystical @entity131 , which places greater emphasis upon a subjective experience of @entity134 and is traditionally more tolerant of human foibles and dissent			0
almost every part of the @entity31 world has produced progressive movements , some headed by women			2
@entity142 gave the world @entity143 and @entity145 @entity144			0
in all cases , the political development of @entity72 countries has been as much shaped by poverty and the legacy of colonialism as it has @entity31			2
@entity92 might have continued on a course toward liberalism had the @entity154 not sponsored an anti-democratic coup in 1953			0
in short , there is no monolithic @entity31 history or experience , which makes it hard or even disingenuous to talk about the challenge that @entity31 as a whole poses to the @entity154			2
put another way , no @entity30 would want anyone to think that the @entity164 spoke for all of @entity50			2
@entity2 's second , equally fallacious claim is that @entity31 's growth in the @entity154 has been encouraged by liberal elites as a means to destroy traditional @entity50 culture			1
indeed , multiculturalism has been strongly critiqued by two @entity171 prime ministers -- @entity172 and @entity173			0
@entity173 said that it had " failed " because it did not demand submission to the liberal principles of gender and sexual equality			0
but multiculturalism is not a @entity181 ideology carefully plotted by the " @entity183 radicals " so loathed by @entity184			0
rather , it was free - market economics and globalization that caused the mass migration of @entity72 from @entity190 -- and multiculturalism was simply a policy response			1
the aim was to protect the cultural integrity of both host and guest populations by allowing them separate spaces in which to develop			0
far from intending to threaten the religious or civil liberties of the majority @entity50 population ( which remains vastly superior in numbers ) , the goal was to create a common framework of laws but otherwise leave everyone to their own devices			2
if @entity50 has declined in the @entity154 , it 's the fault of the @entity211 who stopped going to church -- not the small groups of @entity72 quietly attending their local mosque			1
and yet @entity72 in @entity33 countries now live under the pressures of anti-terrorist surveillance and social ostracism			2
they are forced to defend their @entity219 , their @entity220 or their @entity221 -- even if they are third - or fourth - generation citizens of those countries			0
@entity2 's attack has raised the threat level against the @entity154 's muslims : they are now the target of our politically engaged sociopaths			1
given how widespread the condemnation of both @entity31 and multiculturalism is across the @entity154 , perhaps it is apt to describe @entity2 as a symptom of @entity33 psychological angst			1
it is a condition of neurosis about decline and paranoia about foreign invasion that is in desperate need of remedy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

@entity246 : at trial , @entity2 seems mad , but views on @entity31 mirror some from politicians
@entity244 : @entity2 says @entity31 inferior to @entity50 and elite liberals push multiculturalism
both false , he says , with @entity31 *varied* , rich ; multiculturalism result of free - market economics
@entity244 : @entity2 's views seem a tragic symptom of @entity33 psychological angst about @entity31
