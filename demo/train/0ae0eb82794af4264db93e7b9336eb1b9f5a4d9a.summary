-- two new @entity2 games , " @entity3 " and " @entity3 , " have taken the gaming world by storm , selling more than 4 million units globally in their first two days of availability , and tracking to become the fastest - selling games of all time for the handheld @entity10			1
not bad for a franchise that got its start in 1996 on the @entity14 handheld console			2
but the president of the @entity16 said the new games stay true to their roots of bringing people together to play while offering a new blueprint for the universe of pocket monsters			1
" from the beginning , communication between players has been the primary goal for the @entity2 brand , " @entity16 told @entity0			2
" today , the ability to connect millions of people around the world via @entity31 is why launching ' @entity3 ' and ' @entity3 ' simultaneously worldwide was an ambitious yet important goal			1
" since debuting in video and card games , @entity33 has become a cultural phenomenon across the globe			1
there have been cartoons , cereals and a feature - length film , not to mention the national and global tournaments that draw thousands of players			2
" got ta catch ' em all " is the franchise 's catch phrase , referring to the player 's goal of catching and training the tiny monsters to compete against other players			1
that 's gotten significantly harder , though , with the expansion to more than 700 different known creatures in the universe			1
unlike previous titles that were named after colors , " @entity3 " and " @entity3 " represent a more analytical way of developing the games for the @entity16 and @entity60			1
@entity61 said it required designers to understand that not all @entity2 gamers play for the same reasons			0
" @entity66 represent the @entity67 and the y - axis , but not in a scientific sense , " he said			0
" each person 's thought process , though different , tends to intersect somewhere			2
i 'd like to think this commonality or intersection occurs when people of diverse backgrounds play ' @entity3 ' and ' @entity3 ' together			1
" developers also included a new transformation ability called @entity78			0
as @entity2 battle and gain experience , they evolve into stronger forms of themselves with improved skills and stats			0
@entity78 allows the creature to temporarily become stronger in battle			0
here 's the catch : not all @entity2 can @entity86			2
" ( @entity87 ) requires players to use new strategies while they play , taking the brand to a new dimension , " @entity61 said			2
" this is yet another reason we chose titles that were theoretical instead of names based on colors or precious stones			0
" keeping the franchise fresh for fans while making it accessible to a new audience is important to @entity61			0
@entity2 is the second - best - selling gaming franchise in the world , trailing only the " @entity104 " series			0
recognizing that its place in video game history is assured , @entity61 said new technology allows designers to do things with @entity33 they could n't do in previous titles			1
" maintaining a balance of familiarity and innovation is important , " he said			0
" ever - evolving technology helps maintain that balance , because we can progress aspects of the game that people enjoy already and add things like new communication features that could only be imagined five , ten years ago			0
" " we feel this balance is key to the franchise 's success and longevity			1
in ' @entity3 ' and ' @entity3 , ' i think we do an excellent job of introducing the basics of the game to the player in a natural way , building their understanding step after step , all while ensuring the pacing allows the longtime fan to jump in and progress quickly to the more challenging portions of the gameplay			1
" the two new titles represent the franchise 's first foray onto the @entity10 handheld console			1
the visual enhancements give players the opportunity to see their favorites move and interact in ways they never could before			2
the technical abilities of the @entity10 let players see their favorite moves and interactions in new ways , as well as play with other gamers around the world			1
@entity61 said in late december that a new cloud service called @entity156 would let players move their creatures back and forth between games -- a service fans have been asking for for many years			1
" we have to stick to the core of the franchise -- the collecting , battling and trading -- while at the same time we have to take advantage of the new technology and the evolution of the hardware to expand on the aspect of communication , " he said			0
" we also need to make sure that it 's fun and rewarding to do each of these things			0
it 's not an easy task			0
" despite the advancements in technology , improvements to the look and intense level of fan interest , @entity61 believes that the franchise 's simple , original goal -- to bring people together -- works as well today as it did 17 years ago			1
" the @entity2 universe is incredibly fun and diverse , and like the world we all live in , continues to surprise and excite us , " he said			0
" i 'm really excited to continue working to connect people in ways we only dreamed about when we first started			0
there is still so much to discover , so many @entity33 to find			2
" got ta catch ' em all indeed .			0
