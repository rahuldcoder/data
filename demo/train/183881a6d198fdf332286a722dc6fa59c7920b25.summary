it 's been nearly six months since @entity3 ' death , and in the last two , the late comedian 's family have entered into a dispute over the personal property his trust assigns each of them			1
on one side is his widow , @entity12 , who filed a petition in december for a court 's interpretation of the trust			1
on the other are his three children by previous marriages , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , who dispute the reading she provides			1
the dispute centers on the two houses @entity3 owned at the time of his death — one in @entity30 and one in @entity32 , @entity33			1
@entity12 's filing calls the @entity32 house the " marital abode , " and the trust , which her late husband most recently amended in 2010 , before their marriage in 2011 , grants her the @entity32 residence and its contents upon his death			2
that 's where things get complicated			0
@entity3 ' widow claims that " within days " of his death in august , the trustees started gathering up the comedian 's property			1
within weeks they allegedly informed her they would come to the @entity32 residence to remove more of it			0
" the co-trustees had keys to her home			0
naturally , mrs. @entity12 became frightened of the @entity57 invading her home , " reads her petition , filed in @entity63			0
in their opposition , filed in the same court on january 21 , @entity3 ' children tell it differently			1
they claim that collecting and inventorying @entity3 ' property is part of the execution of the trust			1
furthermore , they say she held them off for nearly three months " while at the same time permitting various third parties to access the residence on her own behalf to appraise certain trust assets , remove certain @entity80 assets from the @entity81 , and plan , design and implement a $ 30,000 renovation			2

but her resistance to the trustees ' efforts was in part due to concerns over the interpretation of the trust			2
specifically , there 's one paragraph about certain items of @entity3 ' property that his beneficiaries have made into a tricky semantics debate			1
the paragraph assigns to @entity3 ' children all of his " clothing , jewelry , personal photos taken prior to his marriage to ( @entity12 ) ... memorabilia and awards in the entertainment industry and the tangible personal property located in @entity30			1
" in @entity12 's interpretation , the paragraph is ambiguous regarding the house ( or houses ) from which the items can be removed			2
is the phrase " located in @entity30 " in reference only to " tangible personal property , " or is it restrictive of every category ? she claims her husband wished " to allow her to stay in their @entity32 home as it was during their marriage , " and therefore the paragraph should be read to cover only the items in the @entity30 house , not those in the @entity32 house			0
" any other interpretation would lead to mrs. @entity12 's home being stripped while mrs. @entity12 still lives there , " her filing reads			0
it would give the trustees permission to give to the children items including the tuxedo he wore at their wedding , she specifies			2
" it is difficult to imagine mr. @entity3 desiring that outcome			1
" but @entity3 ' kids read the trust differently — they argue that it grants them every category of item listed in addition to the property in the @entity30 house , not every category of item confined to the @entity30 house			1
it 's nonsensical to list " the tangible personal property located in @entity30 " separately if there are n't items to which they 're entitled outside the @entity30 house , they argue			0
they point out lines in the trust that give @entity12 the @entity32 house and its contents with the exceptions of items gifted in other stipulations			2
they want the court to declare they 're entitled to the categories ' items in the @entity32 house , too			0
" the @entity3 children are heartbroken that @entity183 , @entity3 ' wife of less than three years , has acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate , " reads their opposition			1
" while it is styled as a request for instruction , the petition in fact appears to be a blatant attempt to alter the disposition of assets mr. @entity3 specifically planned and provided for			1
" " we 're puzzled a little by the tone of the opposition , " @entity12 ' attorney , @entity194 , tells the @entity0			0
" i 'm hopeful that there 's a spirit of generosity in this			0
" read more : @entity3 had " @entity202 , " wife says but @entity12 's petition anticipates their counterargument , and in the event a judge finds the paragraph applies to the @entity32 house , she wants categories like " memorabilia " and " jewelry " narrowly defined			1
the former should encompass only items depicting him or relating to his fame — " in other words , this does not include his personal collections of knick - knacks " — and the latter should n't include his watches , she argues			0
@entity3 's children dispute her interpretations , in particular criticizing her characterization of their father 's collections — which apparently included @entity229 anime figurines , antique weapons , carved boxes , theater masks , rare books , lapel pins , fossils , graphic novels and skulls — as " knick - knacks			1
" they were " carefully amassed " during his lifetime and should go to his children , they argue			2
" as the @entity243 grew , so did their father 's collections and they shared in their father 's excitement as additions were made to his collections , " their filing reads			0
there 's one separate question , too			0
it 's unclear whether the contents of storage spaces @entity12 claims were intended for the @entity32 home should go to her as if they were contents of the house itself			0
@entity33 courts have never addressed the issue , according to @entity12 's filing			0
" in other states that have considered this issue , courts have found that a residence , i.e. a home should be broadly interpreted , " her filing continues			0
the @entity3 children , unsurprisingly , present different case law that indicates a home should be strictly understood to mean the physical location			1
a hearing is scheduled for march 30 in @entity63 in @entity271 , where @entity32 is located , but @entity194 tells @entity86 he hopes the parties will sort it out in discussions before then			0
attorneys for the @entity3 children have not responded to a request for comment			1
