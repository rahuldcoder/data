when four women from the band walked up , arms locked , the university students pulled out raw chickens and began chanting " we like sex with chicken " in mangled @entity65			2
the students and costumed chicken then attempted to disrupt the makeshift news conference given by the women in the park outside the hotel			1
" we do n't understand their behavior and that 's why we 're protesting , " said 23 - year old @entity72 , one of the members of the @entity75 demonstrators			2
@entity72 said he was afraid the punk band would desecrate a @entity81 cathedral that had been recently constructed on the outskirts of @entity0 's @entity83			1
