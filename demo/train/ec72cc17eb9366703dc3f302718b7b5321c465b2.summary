-- if you do n't spend much time online , and if you 're older than most college students , you may have missed the thousands of teens and 20 - somethings who were running around the country this week with red " x " marks on their hands			1
no , they did n't go clubbing last night			2
they 're trying to end slavery			1
it 's ok if those things seem wildly unconnected at first			2
the gap between drawing a mark on your hand and preventing a woman in @entity20 , @entity21 or @entity22 from being sold into the sex trafficking business , or liberating one of the estimated 20 to 30 million people who are enslaved today , is admittedly a large one			1
and , because of that , the @entity27 movement , which organized the recent online - plus - real - world campaign , has gotten some heat from some laptop cynics who say their efforts are n't making a real , tangible difference in the big - sad - real world			1
" it 's almost offensive how stupid this # endit movement is , " one person wrote on @entity37			1
" these red x 's in people 's hands are n't freeing any slaves			1
all these pictures are just annoying me			0
# enough # endit , " said another			0
but i say forget all that			0
slapping a red " x " on your hand and uploading a photo of it to @entity51 or @entity37 with the hashtag @entity52 ( as tens of thousands have done ) can help end slavery			1
it 's not going to happen right away , of course			0
but it 's the first step			0
" nothing happens just because we are aware of modern - day slavery , " the group says on its website , " but nothing will ever happen until we are			1
" amen , brothers and sisters			0
the debate over the merits of these sorts of online awareness raising campaigns , sometimes referred to as " slacktivism " or " clicktivism , " is getting tired			1
it seems to have started in 2009 , when @entity37 users made their avatars green in support of anti-regime protests in @entity80			0
that social media campaign succeeded , but the protests , of course , failed			0
shortly after , @entity84 's @entity83 proclaimed that " the revolution would not be tweeted " because the @entity87 's " weak ties seldom lead to high - risk activism , " which is needed in order to spur real change			1
those ideas resurfaced last month when the @entity93 @entity92 was hearing two same - sex marriage cases			1
the @entity95 , an advocacy group , asked @entity96 and @entity37 users to change their public profile images to a red equals sign , in support of marriage equality			1
millions of people made the switch			1
but some writers , including @entity105 from @entity106 , argued that this one - click symbolic action was " completely useless			2
" " yes , the show of support is heartwarming			0
it 's nice to see so many people who want their gay friends to be spoiled brides just like all their straight friends , but you 're not doing anything , " he wrote on @entity106			2
" this is just another form of passive activism that is n't advancing the cause			0
do you know what would be helpful ? actually picking up a sign , heading down to the @entity92 and joining the throngs of protesters			0
do you know what would be useful ? instead of just downloading an image and clicking a few buttons , going to the website of a gay rights organization ( or any gay organization for that matter ) and giving them some money so they can fight for gay civil rights on your behalf			0
" he also suggested that the slacktivists write letters to representatives			0
both writers make good points , but their arguments should n't be used to condemn efforts to raise awareness about pressing social issues			2
and they discount the real good that these social media efforts can and do have			1
the evidence is incomplete , but i 'd bet that " completely useless " @entity95 equals - sign demonstration led people to do exactly all the things that @entity105 suggests would be more valuable than clicking a button on @entity96			1
" i do n't have hard data , but we definitely saw an increase in donations through our website , " said @entity157 , spokesman for @entity95			0
" in fact , our site crashed on wednesday ( march 27 ) from all of the traffic			2
i think that , anecdotally , there is reason to suggest it has helped from a fundraising perspective , and i think there 's a larger social good from the visibility			0
" on the " larger good " point , @entity157 mentioned a message @entity95 received from a man who said his mom 's first show of support for him as an openly gay person was to change her @entity96 profile image to the red equals sign			2
@entity93 sen. @entity181 , from @entity182 , announced his public support for marriage equality by making the change on @entity96			2
and , @entity157 said , there is the likely possibility that closeted gay kids were comforted when they saw the flood of digital support for gay rights			0
similarly , real - world action has accompanied the @entity27 movement 's red " x " campaign			1
the group , which funded its activities with donations it collected from college kids at the @entity202 - themed @entity201 conference in january , has raised more than $ 200,000 for several anti-slavery organizations			2
all of that money went to noble nonprofits , not to the @entity27 movement itself , said @entity207 , the group 's " chief steward			1
" students at about 2,000 @entity93 colleges and universities have " done something " in response to the campaign , which began in february and culminated on tuesday with the red " x " project online , @entity207 told me			2
the @entity217 , the group that runs an anti-trafficking hot line , says its call volume was up 65 % in january , to 2,850 calls , in part because that 's when the @entity27 movement launched at the @entity202 youth conference			1
@entity224 , a spokesman for the @entity217 , said calls were up this week , too , although it 's harder to tease out the source , because the group on tuesday announced a partnership with @entity230 to create the @entity231			0
and , most tellingly , a young woman in @entity233 , @entity207 told me , was rescued from sex trafficking because someone who had heard about the @entity27 movement questioned whether she was in trouble			1
her family thought she had run away from home , he said			0
none of that sounds like slacking to me			0
if you want to help end modern slavery , i 'd encourage you to visit the " action " section of the @entity27 movement 's website and also @entity0 's @entity249 blog			1
we have a list of reputable nonprofit groups , both internationally and listed by country			0
there also is a list of anti-trafficking hot lines around the world ; a guide to help parents and educators figure out how to talk to kids about slavery ; and a list of signs that a person may be the victim of human trafficking			1
the @entity217 also recently created a texting feature , in part to help people who are victims of sex trafficking or slavery			1
people who are in trouble , or who suspect they have witnessed trafficking , can text " help " to " @entity276 " ( 233733 )			2
if you have other ideas , please share them in the comments below			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity282 .			0

the @entity27 movement is drawing attention to modern slavery
an estimated 27 million people are enslaved today
@entity290 : their online efforts could be *disparaged* as " slacktivism "
he says their online campaigns , however , have led to real - world change
