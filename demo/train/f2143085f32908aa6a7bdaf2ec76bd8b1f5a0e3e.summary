a very public squabble between two top @entity2 politicians who might be leading contenders for the 2016 @entity2 presidential nomination has grabbed clicks online and airtime on cable news			1
the war of words between @entity11 gov. @entity10 and sen. @entity12 of @entity13 over national security , civil liberties and federal spending is also a proxy for the bigger battle for the future of the @entity2			1
here are five things we 're learning from their spat			0
the fight for the 2016 @entity2 nomination is under way it 's only the summer of 2013 , but the intensity of the exchanges between @entity10 and @entity12 makes it feel like late 2015 in some ways , with the start of the caucus and primary season just weeks away			1
the back and forth started last week when @entity10 , at a forum in @entity35 with other @entity2 governors , slammed @entity12 for his criticism of government surveillance to battle terrorists			1
" this strain of libertarianism that 's going through parties right now and making big headlines , i think , is a very dangerous thought , " @entity10 said			1
asked if @entity12 was one of the people he was pointing toward , @entity10 added : " you can name any number of people and he 's one of them			1
" i 'm the one trying to grow the party by talking about libertarian ideas of privacy and the @entity54 and attacking me is n't helping the party			2
he 's hurting the party , " @entity12 said in an interview with @entity58 's @entity57 on " @entity59			1
" rep. @entity62 , who 's also considering a run for the @entity64 , also jumped into the fray with comments critical of the libertarian - leaning senator			2
" he wants to retreat from the world			0
he wants to isolate ourselves , go back to a fortress @entity72 , " @entity62 told @entity57 on wednesday			0
@entity73 rejects @entity12 - backed plan to end aid to @entity76 2			2
this is far from over while this round may be finished , others are sure to follow			0
on wednesday , @entity12 made a pitch for the two men to sit down and talk it out , hoping to ease tensions			2
" i 'm inviting him to a beer -- anytime he would like to come down and sit down at the pub right around the corner from the @entity73 , " @entity12 said in an interview on @entity85 , adding that proposed get - together did n't have to be in the nation 's capital			1
" we could always negotiate a middle ground like @entity95 maybe , " said @entity12			2
that did n't seem to fly with the tough - talking governor			0
" i 'm running for re-election in @entity11 , i do n't really have time for that at the moment			0
if i find myself in @entity103 , i 'll certainly look him up , " @entity10 said in a radio interview on @entity11 101.5			0
" but i 've got work to do here			0
" expect the action to pick up again in the future			0
" this is just the beginning			0
this is not going to stop , " @entity58 chief national correspondent @entity109 said			0
@entity2 strategist and @entity58 contributor @entity111 agreed			1
" i think we are going to end up with a @entity2 primary that looks a lot like a cage match , " she said			1
war of words illustrates bigger battle sure , this is about 2016 , but it 's also about a much bigger fight for the future of the @entity2			1
most republicans agree : major changes are needed if the party wants to be competitive in future presidential elections			0
but a new poll of @entity2 nationwide also indicates that there 's little agreement on the direction the @entity2 should take			2
that 's playing out in the fireballs between @entity10 and @entity12 : the @entity11 governor represents the more traditional establishment wing of the party , with @entity12 the standard - bearer for the libertarian and grassroots conservative / tea party wing			1
with losses in the last two presidential elections still stinging , two - thirds of @entity2 questioned in the @entity145 poll say that the @entity2 needs to address major problems to do better in future presidential contests			2
three in 10 disagree , saying the party just needs to address minor problems			0
along those lines , nearly six in 10 say the party needs to reconsider some positions , with 36 % saying the @entity2 needs to make a stronger case for its current policies			2
rep. @entity62 : @entity12 should n't be face of @entity2 but there 's less agreement on what the path the party should take			1
by 54 % -40 % margin , @entity2 and @entity2 - leaning voters say party leaders should move in a more conservative direction , with four in 10 urging a more moderate direction			1
" not surprisingly , conservatives and those who agree with the tea party overwhelmingly favor moving in a more conservative direction , while moderates and liberals would like to see the party take more centrist positions			2
yet the more moderate wing of the party is a minority generally , and makes up an even smaller share of the likely primary electorate , " @entity145 said in releasing the poll			0
@entity62 said that ensures a " spirited debate " in the months ahead			0
" they have to deal with the immigration issue again			0
they have that ditch with @entity189 voters			0
" @entity192 : tough choice between @entity194 and @entity12 4			0
@entity10 does n't pull punches yes , we knew this			0
but this episode reminds us of how blunt @entity10 can be			0
while @entity12 seemed on wednesday to be trying to bring the scuffle to an end , @entity10 held his ground			1
" at the end of the day , i did n't call him any names , yet he called me names , " @entity10 said in his radio interview wednesday			0
" i just have to assume from that that he 's just trying to get attention			0
" @entity10 was talking about his initial comments that sparked the feud , adding : " it really had nothing to do with senator @entity12 , but senator @entity12 wanted to make it about senator @entity12 , " @entity10 added			1
@entity10 speaks his mind , which appeals to voters , and not just @entity2			1
while @entity12 has a higher favorable rating among @entity2 than @entity10 , according to the @entity145 poll , @entity10 has crossover appeal with @entity220 and @entity221 that @entity12 ca n't match			1
did @entity12 go there ? @entity12 accused @entity10 of harming national security by hoarding federal relief money for @entity227 victims			1
@entity10 responded by calling on @entity12 to cut federal pork spending in @entity13			1
" but i doubt he would because most @entity103 politicians only care about bringing home the bacon so that they can get re-elected , " @entity10 charged on tuesday			2
@entity12 responded later in the day on " @entity59 , " saying , " this is the king of bacon talking about bacon			1
" was there more to @entity12 's " bacon " comment than just pork spending ? @entity12 advisers say it had nothing to do with @entity10 's weight , which was an issue when he first ran for governor in 2009			1
while it 's not a problem for @entity10 as he appears to cruise towards re-election , it will most definitely come up again and again if he opts to run for the @entity64 .			2

war of words between @entity12 and @entity10 *reflects* division among @entity2
@entity12 represents conservative - libertarian wing of the party , @entity10 represents moderates
@entity2 strategist predicts @entity2 primaries will look ' a lot like a cage match '
was @entity12 's ' king of bacon ' comment about @entity10 's weight ?
