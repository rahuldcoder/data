-- @entity2 's tragic loss of at least 47 people in the car bombings in the border town of @entity6 illustrates vividly that @entity2 is not immune to the raging violence next door			1
@entity2 has suffered similar , though far less deadly events in the past year , including @entity10 downing a @entity2 jet , the killing of five @entity2 in cross-border artillery fire and a car bomb blast at a @entity2 - @entity10 border crossing in february killing more than a dozen people			1

the @entity23 estimates that number of refugees will triple by the end of this year			0
moreover , it is a critical staging post and a logistical lifeline for opposition fighters against the leadership of @entity31 in @entity32			0
unsurprisingly , the @entity2 government quickly claimed that @entity31 instigated a left - wing @entity35 revolutionary group in @entity2 to carry out the spectacular attacks			2
@entity10 vehemently rejected the charge			2

@entity40 reticence towards military involvement in @entity10 in the wake of the wars in @entity48 and @entity49 and the fears of extremist groups dominating the @entity10 insurgency is causing enormous consternation in @entity54			2
@entity2 's prime minister @entity55 will attempt to persuade @entity40 president @entity56 at their meeting on thursday to impose a no - fly zone in @entity10 and to provide " lethal " assistance to @entity10 opposition fighters			1
@entity56 will be sympathetic but unlikely to be immediately forthcoming			0

he insisted that @entity2 will maintain its " extreme cool - headedness in the face of efforts and provocations to drag " his country into the @entity10 civil war			1
this is in stark contrast to @entity76 robust airstrikes against what is understood to be military supplies via @entity10 to the @entity82 @entity81 @entity80 group			2
@entity56 has , noticeably and repeatedly , supported the right of @entity76 to " guard against the transfer of advanced weaponry			0
" @entity10 : attack on military facility was a ' declaration of war ' by @entity76 consequently , the @entity6 incident will probably not be a game - changing development			1
rather it may intensify four visible trends of the conflict in @entity10			0
firstly , the @entity2 - @entity10 910km porous frontier is increasingly becoming a volatile and chaotic region beyond the full control of @entity54			1
it no longer affords protection against the instability ripping @entity10 apart and could in the future be a destabilizing influence to the immediate neighborhood , including @entity42			0
@entity54 lacked the intelligence capabilities to track the movement of the two bomb - laden vehicles near this frontier			0
secondly , the domestic unpopularity of the @entity2 government 's stance on @entity10 may deepen even further			1
according to a recent poll by @entity40 - based @entity115 , merely one - quarter of @entity2 respondents favour either @entity2 or @entity117 countries " sending arms to anti-government groups in @entity10			1
" this partially explains why @entity2 is refraining from direct retaliatory measures against @entity31			0

neither @entity2 nor its @entity117 partners are able or willing to act decisively without the @entity40 leading from the front			0
by comparison the @entity131 alliance of @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity49 and @entity80 act in unison to stymie the downfall of @entity31			0
fourth , the bloodshed could feed the perceptions of an escalating sectarian fault line along the @entity2 - @entity10 border			1
@entity6 is located in the @entity2 province of @entity142 sharing the sectarian and ethnic diversity of @entity10 itself			1
there are concerns that the exacerbating tensions in @entity10 might undermine the delicate sectarian balance in southern @entity2			1
@entity2 had boundless ambition and energy to project regional power and influence in the @entity153			0
@entity6 , and the @entity10 civil war more generally , is a stark reminder of the messy transition in an unpredictable part of the world			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of @entity161 .			0

@entity161 says blasts in @entity6 illustrate that @entity2 is not immune to violence next door
@entity2 is hosting more than 400,000 largely @entity21 @entity10 refugees at a cost of $ 1.5 billion
the @entity6 incident will probably not be a game - changing development , @entity161 writes
