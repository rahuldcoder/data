only about one in 10 workers who lose their job opt to keep their employer - sponsored health insurance through the safety - net program @entity4 , most likely because the premiums are too expensive , according to an analysis released friday by the @entity7 , a private foundation that supports independent research on health care issues			1
only about one in 10 workers who lose their job opt to keep their insurance through the @entity4 program			1
experts worry that the highest unemployment rate in 16 years , combined with a health care system dependent on employer - sponsored health insurance , is a recipe for disaster , and will swell the ranks of the uninsured particularly if people are n't using @entity4			1
about 46 million people in the @entity22 ( 18 percent of those under 65 ) lacked health insurance in 2007			1
@entity24 : laid off ? the healthiest ways to spend your time the new report is based on a 2007 survey of 3,501 people			1
the researchers found that two - thirds of workers , if they were laid off , would be eligible for @entity4			1
data from 2006 data suggest that only 9 percent would opt into the program			0
health care insurance premiums have risen since then , so it 's likely that the problem is getting worse not better , they say			2
" the affordability issue gets worse every year , that 's the big concern , " says @entity41 , @entity42 , an associate professor of health economics and policy at the @entity45 , who was not involved in the study			2
" of course [ some people can ] still get an offer of coverage through a spouse , but we 're still talking about very , very serious increases in the number of uninsured			2
" @entity24 : natural cold and flu remedies @entity4 ( @entity4 ) was passed in 1985 to allow laid - off workers to continue their health insurance if they lose their job			1
( @entity4 only covers workers in companies that offer health insurance , have 20 or more employees , and are still in business			1
) but there 's a catch			0
most employers pick up 75 percent to 85 percent of the tab for their workers ' health insurance , and once a person has been laid off , the entire bill falls on the ex-employee 's shoulders			1
that means that health insurance costs dramatically escalate at a time when people have little or no money to burn			1
the @entity7 estimates that the cost of @entity4 is four to six times higher than what people pay when they are employed ; $ 4,704 per year for an individual and $ 12,680 for a family			2
@entity24 : live healthy for way less @entity91 , 26 , of @entity92 , @entity93 , has type 1 diabetes and was laid off from her job as an interior designer in october			2
at the time , she did n't sign up for @entity4 , a decision she now seriously regrets			2
overwhelmed , she did n't realize she had a 60 days to sign up for the program and missed the deadline by a couple of days			0
" on the day i got laid off i got a packet slapped in front of my face and that was it , " she says			2
" i was just totally in the dark			0
" she quickly found out that she could n't get health insurance that would cover her type 1 diabetes , at least without a six - month or year - long waiting period , because it is considered a preexisting condition			1
she stockpiled a six - month supply of lifesaving insulin in the two - week period before she lost her job , but since then has scrimped on the drug to make it last longer			0
at one point , she even disconnected her pump , which delivers a continuous dose of insulin , for about three weeks			0
she used only a couple of insulin injections in that time to control high blood sugar , a potentially serious threat to her health			0
even if she did sign up , she 's not sure she could afford the premiums , which would have cost about $ 8,000 a year			0
@entity24 : healthy meals for under $ 10 " ultimately , yes , i need it , but cost did factor into it , " she says			0
" i do n't know that i would have been able to keep up my payments because i was barely able to keep up on my rent			0
" cost is clearly a major issue for most laid - off workers , says @entity136 , president of the @entity7			1
only 3 percent of workers near the poverty level who are eligible for @entity4 opt to keep their insurance , compared to 14 percent of workers who made more money before they lost their job			1
it 's a problem that " is not going away , " says @entity147 , " the @entity145 estimates that we 're going to go to 8.3 percent unemployed in 2009 and 9 percent in 2010 , " says @entity147			0
( the unemployment rate was 7.2 percent in december			0
) she notes that each percentage point increase in the unemployment rate leads to a 1.1 million increase in the number of uninsured			0
" so it 's pretty urgent that the economic stimulus bill not only address the job situation , but address health insurance coverage too , " she says			1
while some laid - off workers may get health insurance coverage though a spouse or partner , their research suggests that only about 14 percent of people who are not eligible for @entity4 could get coverage through a partner or some other source after losing their job , she says			1
@entity41 and other experts hope that if there is a silver lining , it 's that there may be more political will to change the current health care coverage system			0
" one of the biggest challenges to health care coverage reform has been that the status quo is okay for many people , particularly for many people who vote , " she says			2
" if that is no longer true , and if the people who have coverage now are insecure enough , they may be willing to give up something to get coverage security			0
" @entity91 just hopes she can get health insurance soon			1
" it sounds just colossally stupid to not have heath insurance , but i luckily had enough vials and insulin so i 'm not near running out now , but i have to get health insurance in the near future , " she says			2
" @entity193 forbid i had to go to the hospital during this ; that would be a nightmare			0
