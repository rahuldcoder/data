-- with only 71,000 private sector jobs created in july , the latest employment report tells the story of a slow and agonizing recovery			1
but if you look beneath the surface of recent government data , you can see the developing outline of the next powerful expansion			2
the leader ? the broad digital communications sector -- everything from telecom infrastructure to content providers to applications developers			1
communications is one of the few areas where people are consuming more since the recession started , and key communications industries have continued to add jobs despite the downturn			1
all of which suggests that @entity25 policymakers should do everything they can to hitch a ride on the communications sector and find ways to stoke the jobs and spending engine a little bit			1
but proposals to regulate internet activity now before the @entity34 would do the opposite			1
what 's needed from regulators now is some creativity and humility -- in the form of " countercyclical regulatory policy			1
" this gives innovators a bit of breathing space at the start of an economic recovery , but sets the stage to tighten regulations later on if excesses develop			2
this approach does not mean regulators can go to sleep nor does it mean they can raise the flag of laissez - faire			0
what 's needed is the nuanced judgment of sentries posted at a tense border spot			2
with watchful eyes , regulators must practice thoughtful restraint that allows space for job leaders to innovate and hire , while remaining ready to aggressively confront violations of law or abuses of consumer rights if they take place			0
the communications sector is one of the few bright lights in an otherwise dismal economic picture			2
@entity72 just reported its 500 millionth member ; droids are flying out of stores ; and the @entity76 is the latest " must have " in technology			0
to enjoy the new toys , @entity78 are paying for more powerful mobile connections , too			0
the powerful pull of the new technology shows up in statistics from the @entity84 and the @entity85			0
since the recession began in the fourth quarter of 2007 , real personal consumption has dropped in big categories of spending , such as motor vehicles , furniture , clothing , eating out and recreation services			1
there are only two major exceptions to this pattern of big cutbacks			0
for one , real consumption has risen in some health , education and social services -- all areas that receive a lot of government funding			0
but operating without big government subsidies , the communications sector has shown equally impressive gains			2
real consumption of cell phone services , adjusted for price changes , is up 12.6 percent since the end of 2007			0
purchases of internet service , adjusted for price changes , have risen by 5.1 percent , and personal purchases of telephone equipment , adjusted for price changes , are up more than 25 percent			0
at the same time , key communications - related industries have managed to keep adding jobs			1
jobs at internet publishing and broadcasting and web search portals -- think @entity125 and @entity126 -- are up 16 percent since the recession started in december 2007			1
employment in the " custom computer programming " industry -- think website and apps development -- took a hit in the first half of 2009 , but since then has bounced back strong			0
the same is true for jobs in wireless telecom , which bottomed out in july 2009 and have been on a slow upward trend since then			1
this strength signals that the broad communications sector can help drive recovery , because businesses that hire during a recession usually carry that strength into the subsequent upswing			1
if history is any guide , these job leaders may grow at least twice as fast as the rest of the economy during the next expansion			0
that brings us to regulators and government policy			2
policymakers should follow the principle of " do no harm " when dealing with communications , one of the few sectors showing vibrant growth			1
that means the @entity34 should avoid the temptation to add rules , even with good intentions			1
in particular , the @entity34 is considering bringing broadband under the same common carrier rules that govern older phone networks			1
this tightening of the regulatory regime would be part of a move toward net neutrality , a policy that would impose rules on broadband providers and govern the services and products they could offer			1
the debate over net neutrality is heated , and there are strong arguments on both sides			0
but whether or not you think that such a move is a good idea , such regulations are unlikely to boost investment or employment in the telecom industry , at a time when we need all the capital spending and jobs that we can get			1
for that reason , i suggest a two - year pause in new broadband regulation , keeping the current balance among the different players , which seems to be generating growth			2
at the same time , the knowledge that the regulator remains on duty , ready to intervene , would provide an essential check			0
such a countercyclical approach requires regulatory discipline and wisdom			2
yes , we know from recent experience that regulators can be too lax			0
but there 's an important difference between deliberate restraint by a regulator who remains alert for the right moment to step back in and a regulator who has gone to sleep			0
for now , getting more @entity78 working is more important than imposing too much regulation on growing sectors			0
let 's help the job leaders soar			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			2

@entity225 : even in recession , people spending more on digital communications
policy should stoke jobs and spending engine of communications , @entity225 writes
he says @entity34 regulations under consideration could slow growth
need regulatory policy that allows growth but could clamp down if needed , he says
