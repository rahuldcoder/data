-- a nonprofit 's attempt to expose -- and stop -- the degrading street harassment women face every day has turned dangerously ugly			1
last month , @entity4 , an international movement dedicated to " developing innovative strategies to ensure equal access to public spaces , " released a hidden camera video of @entity7 walking down the streets of @entity9 , just minding her own business			1
according to the video , during the 10 - hour filmed experiment , more than 100 men made unwanted , unprovoked and sometimes unnervingly harassing remarks toward @entity7			1
in a matter of minutes after its release , the video went viral			2
and with this , the story took a drastic and disturbing turn as an aggressive backlash took place			0
threats to rape and kill her were posted across the internet as part of an assault that seemed intent on humiliating and silencing not only @entity7 , but any woman who dares to speak up against inequality and expose the truth about how women are treated in our society			1
this was not the first time such an attack was mounted against a woman advocating for gender equality			0
a month earlier , actress @entity43 endured a similar attack			0
in september , @entity43 stood before the @entity45 , where she spoke eloquently about the virtues of an equal society -- a world in which men and women enjoy freedom and security in equal measure			1
her call to action excluded no one and threatened no one			0
but almost before this speech could be digested , a website featuring a timer was created to count down the hours and minutes until naked images of @entity43 would supposedly be released			0
one report suggested the countdown was a hoax run by @entity29 spammers			0
but the fact that @entity43 would be a target after her speech is in itself extremely telling -- and intimidating			0
sadly , systematically silencing women through rape threats and revenge porn has become the newest weapon in the war on women			1
in fact , weaponizing women 's bodies -- whether by making rape threats or disseminating unwanted and compromising images of women 's bodies -- are crimes , violations that are born of a deep - rooted hatred toward women and a drive to shame into submission any woman who dares to speak out			1
these threats are not just happening to high profile women , but to women and girls everywhere			1
it is happening to girls in high school , when private naked images and rape threats are viciously sent into cyberspace as revenge for their refusal to comply with the wills of the boys at school			1
it 's happening to celebrity women advocating for gender equality			1
it 's happening to women who dare speak up on behalf of the rights of all women			2
this devastating crime is gender specific			0
it is a hate crime against women			2
let 's look at this another way			0
imagine that there were a rash of threats targeted only at @entity120 individuals , gay celebrities and gay youth under constant threat of rape and sexual violence			1
or imagine this was happening to only people of color			0
when such hate - fueled acts are targeted specifically at another historically oppressed group in our society , then they are seen for what they are , a hate - based violation			0
and we would express outrage and rally to the defense of the victims of this crime			0
you do n't have to look too far to see how women are dehumanized in popular culture			2
on tv and in film , we are bombarded with images of women 's bodies that are often bloodied and bruised , naked and dead			2
these bodies are presented as little more than that -- just bodies to be bought and sold , rented and brutalized			0
it 's no wonder that men and young boys become desensitized and think it 's ok to objectify , harass and threaten women who challenge the sexual status quo			1
women 's bodies -- those amazing , life giving , powerful bodies -- are being weaponized by personal images that are disseminated against their will			2
this is , of course , is just one aspect of the war on women , but it is one of the most insidious and damaging			1
it is time that we were collectively outraged -- men and women -- about the use of sexual threats online			1
it 's time to stop turning a blind eye			0
it is time for the silencing of women stop .			2
