combative in debate and with the media , @entity2 may have shown little of his predecessors ' verbal flair -- recent gaffes had him talking about the " suppository , " rather than the repository , " of all wisdom " -- but he has displayed the kind of dogged aggression that @entity4 like to see in their sportsmen			1
