-- an engineering firm has unveiled plans to turn the @entity3 into a vast , tree - like monument by cladding its mesh iron body in over 600,000 plants			1
the controversial proposal from @entity8 -- a @entity10 company that specializes in ecological design projects -- would cost $ 97 million and remove 87.8 tons of carbon dioxide from the @entity14 skies , according to the company 's calculations			1
@entity8 ceo @entity17 concedes that it is probably not the most efficient form of carbon sequestration , but says the idea -- which has so far received no official endorsement from @entity23 -- could have profound symbolic value			2
" we 're told that within the next 30 years the world 's population may reach nine billion , and that 80 % of us will live in cities , " says @entity17 , referring to projections from the @entity26 released earlier this year			1
" with this in mind , we need to think about how we 're going to start bringing nature back into the city landscape ... so this ( proposal ) is our call for action			0
" if @entity17 has his way , thousands of hemp sacks brimming with soil and 48 varieties of seedlings would be fastened to " @entity3 " -- or " the iron lady , " the tower 's @entity10 nickname -- by the end of next year			1
irrigated via a 12 - ton grid of interconnected rubbing tubing , the plants would likely mature by 2014 and would be nurtured until their removal two years later			1
" of course we 're not suggesting this be a permanent fixture , we 're proposing this as a temporary installation -- just as mr @entity55 did when he built the tower back in the 19th century , " says @entity17			1
staff at @entity8 have been developing the mechanics behind the proposal for the past 18 months			0
the company employs over 1,500 people and has a turnover of â ‚ ¬ 230 million a year , according to @entity17			2
comment : would you give them your support ? is the @entity8 's @entity3 tree a feasible innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream ? tell us you thoughts in the comments section below			1
since the @entity3 opened during the @entity74 , the 324 - meter tall lattice monument has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world , with almost seven million paying visitors a year , according to @entity79			1
@entity80 are quick to defend their city 's architectural heritage but says @entity17 , " they are also very concerned about the environment and i 'm sure will come around to the idea			2
" adorned in its new coat of living greenery , the tower would likely become a convenient new home for insects and birds			0
@entity17 says they would be welcome guests and insists neither the foliage nor its accompanying inhabitants would obscure the view			0
" we 'd keep the viewing platforms clear , " he says			0
" our objective is to enhance the structure , not ruin it			0
we want to turn an emblem of the industrial past into a beacon of the sustainable future			0
" @entity17 says that they have selected a variety of plants that can flourish at high altitude and will be performing a feasibility study in the coming week to test if the tower could withstand the significant additional load			2
however , the company is yet to formally present its ideas to either the @entity23 or @entity113			0
" this is a very serious proposal , from a serious company that has put a lot of time and resources into it , " says @entity17			0
" we hope the @entity14 authorities will give us some of their time to listen to the idea			1
" so , what would you say in their shoes ?			0
