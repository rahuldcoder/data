@entity2 national identity is entwined with its nomadic history of horsemen and herders			2
traditional pursuits like horse - riding are alive and well and celebrated each year at the " naadam " festival			0
despite the impact of modernity and urbanization it remains in many ways a " land without fences			0
" sandwiched between @entity25 to the north and @entity27 to the south , @entity2 's president @entity24 likens his country 's position , geographically and politically , to " a pony between two elephants			1
" recent history has seen @entity2 both squeezed and supported by its two heavy - weight neighbors			0
the country declared its independence from @entity27 in 1921 and then fell under the influence of the @entity38 and communism			2
the demise of the @entity38 in 1991 led to the country losing one - third of its gdp , but did result in the creation of a new democratic constitution in 1992			0
the president is the country 's head of state and is elected every four years			1
@entity2 is currently modernizing , but its historical position as the one - time center of the world 's largest - ever land empire is not forgotten within the country			2
history books often portray @entity53 as a blood - thirsty warrior who led murderous hordes across @entity56 and @entity57			0
but in @entity2 he remains revered as the man responsible for uniting nomadic tribes and creating an empire that spread ideas and trade across continents , including the invention of paper money and the concept of diplomatic immunity			0

other sought - after minerals like zinc , gold and uranium have bolstered trade and foreign investment , as well helping to bringing @entity100 and @entity101 to the streets of @entity74			0
but with its wealth of natural assets comes the need to balance development with environmental protection and address the country 's pressing problem of lifting one third of @entity2 's three million people out of poverty .			1
