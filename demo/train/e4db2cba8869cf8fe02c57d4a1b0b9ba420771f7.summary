-- @entity1 -- or what 's left of it -- has rained on many an @entity5 parade , if they were n't canceled ahead of time			1
but what the first named storm of this hurricane season has n't done , it appears , is cause significant damage			1
as of 11 p.m. et , @entity1 was churning deep into the @entity12 about 75 miles east - southeast of the @entity14 town of @entity15 , according to the @entity16			1
it is still technically a hurricane , with sustained winds of 75 mph , and @entity20 and @entity14 face tropical storm warnings			1
but @entity1 was n't expected to live up to dire predictions for the @entity23			1
the center of @entity1 is forecast to pass over or near western @entity25 early saturday			1
by then , the system should be no more than a " post-tropical cyclone , " meaning it will feature rain and little else			1
while the wind wo n't pack as much wallop for the @entity32 , that does n't mean @entity1 did n't have an impact -- especially on those who wanted to both go outside and stay dry over the holiday			1
@entity36 from @entity37 to far northeast @entity38 are experiencing , or could soon experience , drenching rains tied to the outskirts of the category 1 storm			1
this is after a number of moves , such as the hasty rescheduling of @entity48 's @entity5 celebration to one day early , done ahead of the system			1
the good news is that @entity1 was n't the type of holiday guest that hung around long			1
the @entity54 - based hurricane center noted that the storm was speeding along to the northeast -- meaning it is heading farther out to sea -- at a 31 mph clip			1
that is motoring along by hurricane standards , especially for one that was stalled in the @entity12 just a few days ago			2
@entity1 nonetheless managed to dampen some spirits as it raced along			1
on friday afternoon , for instance , southeast @entity64 got lashed by round after round of pounding rains that left some roads covered with water			2
" @entity1 does not like us right now , " a soaked but smiling @entity72 of @entity73 told @entity0 affiliate @entity74			1
" i do n't know ( how ) we disappointed him , but it 's ok			2
i do n't mind it			0
" number of @entity79 without power plummets the state that was supposed to bear the brunt of @entity1 's wrath was @entity84			1
it did indeed get hit , though it was more a glancing blow than a knockout punch			0
but not everyone knew that would be the case at 11:15 p.m. thursday , when @entity1 roared ashore between @entity91 and @entity92 with 100 - mph winds			1
@entity95 's house in @entity96 -- right across the @entity97 from @entity92 , and in the path of the eye wall -- clattered and rumbled			0
in the distance , she heard the whirring hum of storm gusts and snapping of tree limbs			1
" it 's howling pretty good here , " she said late thursday			0
" you can hear it coming across the sound			0
" around 9:30 a.m. friday , gov. @entity109 said 44,000 people in his state were without power due to the storm			1
a @entity0 tabulation around this time found about 18,500 customers , which could translate to households or businesses , without electricity			0
utility companies were able to make significant inroads in getting people 's lights back on as the day wore on			2
by 2:30 p.m. , there were around 5,000 customers without power in the state			2
later in the afternoon , @entity109 followed up by noting that @entity1 had " minimal impact " on coastal communities -- with one plus being that it moved out in time for the holiday and the upcoming weekend			1
the @entity132 forecast called for sunny skies and high temperatures in the 80s			0
@entity136 knows it could have been a lot worse , even with one window lost and water up to the door of the @entity143 restaurant in @entity144 that he runs			0
" @entity147 blew a lot harder than this one , " @entity136 told @entity0 affiliate @entity146 , referring to 1993 's far more powerful @entity147			0
" this one we were really fortunate			0
" concerns about rip currents track the storm though it has moved on , the hurricane leaves deadly danger lurking under its coattails : possible rip currents			2
the weather service calls the spurts of back - flowing water , which can drag a swimmer from the shore and out to sea , the worst danger at the beach			0
in 2009 , tropical storms killed six people			0
all of them drowned in high waves or rip currents , the @entity168 said			0
and it does n't matter if the storm has already passed , it can sprout them from long distances			2
they 're hard to see and snatch bathers without warning			0
@entity179 is an iron man triathlete and confident he could swim out of a rip current if he had to			0
" even so , i 'm not going to get out in the water , " he said			0
it would be a dumb thing to do , especially in front of the children traveling with him			0
" of course , i 'm not going to let the kids out there , " he said			0
@entity179 was vacationing in @entity1 's bull 's eye on @entity191 with his son , daughter and niece			1
he did n't plan for the group to be in the storm 's path			2
he asked his two children and niece where they wanted to spend the holidays ; they voted for the beach , and he granted the wish			0
he thought of canceling the trip as the storm brewed but decided against it			2
" it 's a doable storm , " @entity179 said			2
