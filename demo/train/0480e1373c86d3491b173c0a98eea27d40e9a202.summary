-- the strongest contender to become the next @entity3 prime minister is hardly a newcomer to the country 's political stage			1
@entity6 , 63 , has had a long and rocky career that includes two stints as prime minister during the 1990s , ordering @entity3 's first nuclear tests , a showdown with the nation 's powerful military , time in jail and years of exile			1
after spending the past several years in opposition to the governing @entity17 ( @entity17 ) -- which has struggled to tackle the country 's crippling problems of militant violence , chronic power shortages and a flagging economy -- @entity6 now has a shot at another stint in office			1
but observers say his positions on key issues such as @entity30 extremists and relations with the @entity32 remain vague , raising uncertainty about what kind of approach he would take if his @entity37 ( @entity37 ) were to succeed in forming a government in the national assembly following general elections this weekend			2
there is also concern about his relationship with the military 's top generals , who still maintain a strong influence on @entity3 's foreign and security policies			1
interventions by the military ended @entity6 's terms as prime minister in 1999 when @entity53 , the head of the army at the time , overthrew him in a coup			1
in a dramatic fall from grace , @entity6 ended up in jail , convicted of hijacking charges for trying to stop a plane carrying @entity53 from landing			2
he then went into exile in @entity62 and did n't return to @entity3 until 2007 , when he teamed up with the @entity17 to force @entity53 from office			1
" it 's a big question whether he can coexist with the military , " said @entity64 , a veteran @entity3 journalist and author			1
" he has n't forgiven or forgotten what happened to him			0
" all about the economy @entity6 's campaign has focused on the economy , which seems to matter the most to many @entity3			1
the nation ranks 146th out of 186 countries in the @entity75 ' human development index , a measure of living standards , health and education			0
under the slogan " @entity80 -- strong @entity3 , " @entity6 is playing to his image as a flag - bearer for private industry and entrepreneurship			1
part of a prominent industrial family , he took steps to liberalize the economy during his time in office in the 1990s through measures such as privatizing state - run companies			0
" generally , the business lobby has more confidence in his ability to fix the economy and solve some of the trickier problems , particularly the energy crisis , " said @entity94 , director of policy and programs at the @entity97 , a @entity3 research organization			1
his party has built conspicuous infrastructure projects in recent years in its political stronghold of @entity107 , which is home to more than half of @entity3 's 180 million people and the biggest source of elected seats in the @entity112			1
it 's also the country 's industrial and agricultural heartland			0
the @entity117 question while his economic credentials appear stronger than those of his main rivals , critics have picked up on his apparent reluctance to take a strong line against violent extremists , notably the @entity3 @entity117 , who have carried out relentless , bloody attacks in the area bordering @entity129			2
" he criticizes terrorism , he criticizes the use of force , but he will not criticize a specific organization by name , " said @entity130 , a political analyst focused on defense issues			0
" he will not criticize the @entity3 @entity117 by name			2
" @entity6 was not available for an interview for this article			2
but @entity142 , a veteran @entity3 politician who recently joined the @entity37 , said that the party is in favor of holding talks with the @entity117			2
" we as a party oppose extremism , we oppose bloodshed , " @entity142 said			0
" and we think any and every solution lies with who is sitting across a table and coming to an understanding			0
" the politics of fear @entity6 's party 's cautious stance on the @entity117 and other militant groups results from political expediency and fear , according to @entity162 , who is also the editor of @entity163 , a weekly newspaper			1
religious conservatives , some of whom sympathize with extremist groups , make up an important part of @entity6 's core vote , @entity162 said			1
during his time in office in the 1990s , @entity6 caused alarm among more secular - minded @entity3 by pushing through legislation that sought to introduce aspects of @entity176 law			1
and since the assassination of former prime minister @entity180 during campaigning for the 2008 elections , a lot of @entity3 politicians are afraid of well - organized , merciless militants like the @entity117 , according to @entity162			1
the killing of @entity180 is still being investigated by authorities , but the @entity117 and other militant groups have between them carried out dozens of deadly attacks on campaigners for the current elections			0
uncertainty over relations with @entity32 an unwillingness to continue the fight against insurgents could put a @entity6 government at loggerheads with the military and also strain already difficult relations with the @entity32 , a key prop for @entity3 's shaky public finances			1
@entity6 has openly questioned @entity3 - involvement in the @entity32 - led " war on terror			1
" but observers note he may adapt his approach if he becomes prime minister			1
" he had good working relations with the @entity32 in previous terms , " @entity130 said			0
" my feeling is he will still have good relations			0
once he gets into power , then he has to change			0
" for its part , the @entity32 says it has no preferred contender in the elections			0
" we do not support any particular political party or any individual candidate , and we look forward to engaging the next democratically elected government of @entity3 , " @entity212 , a spokesman for the @entity213 , said last week			2
a new approach to @entity219 ? @entity6 has also raised eyebrows by vowing to improve ties with @entity3 's archrival , @entity223			1
the two nuclear - armed neighbors have fought three wars since their partition at the end of @entity229 colonial rule			0
one of those wars , in 1999 , led to the military coup that drove @entity6 out of office			1
in a recent interview with the @entity223 broadcaster @entity235 , @entity6 said he would carry out an investigation into the 2008 terrorist attacks in @entity238 , which killed more than 160 people			2
@entity223 blames the @entity3 - based group , @entity240 , for carrying out the attacks , accusing @entity242 of not doing enough to pursue its members			0
the group has denied responsibility			0
@entity247 progress if a new @entity3 government is successfully formed from the elections this weekend , it will be the first time in @entity3 's history that the country has democratically transitioned from one elected administration to another			1
one of the reasons for that , analysts say , is that @entity6 and his party took a pragmatic approach to being in opposition , despite their differences with the governing @entity17 and its leader , president @entity262 , @entity180 's widower			2
it 's a far cry from the 1990s , when @entity6 and @entity180 worked constantly to undermine each other 's governments , resulting in instability and interference from the military			2
the 21st - century @entity6 , mindful of his overthrow and exile , appears more committed to upholding democratic , civilian government and not providing the military with an excuse to step in , according to @entity162			2
" that by itself was a very promising development , " he said			0
the trouble with coalitions the big question , however , is how effective any government that emerges from the elections will be			0
although several opinion polls have put @entity6 's party in front , a great deal of uncertainty remains over how many seats it will end up with in the assembly			2
observers say there 's a strong chance that both parties will fall short of an overall majority , resulting in a scramble to form a coalition with smaller parties			0
the most prominent and potentially game - changing of the smaller parties is cricket - star - turned - politician @entity298 's @entity297 ( @entity297 ) , a new player in national elections			0
analysts are finding it hard to predict how many seats @entity297 candidates might secure , especially after @entity298 was seriously injured in a fall at a campaign rally this week			0
if his party wins enough seats , the former captain of the @entity3 cricket team could find himself the kingmaker in its parliament			0
but any coalition government may struggle to formulate strong policies on the critical issues @entity3 faces , even under an established figure like @entity6			1
that could leave other institutions with room to exert their influence			0
" theoretically , the prime minister is in charge , " @entity162 said			1
" in practice , the military is more powerful			0
" @entity0 's @entity324 and @entity325 contributed to this report .			0

@entity6 , a *frontrunner* in @entity3 elections , has been prime minister twice
he was overthrown in a 1999 coup and went into exile in @entity62
he is now campaigning with a promise to revive @entity3 's economy
observers have raised questions about his stance on extremism and terrorism
