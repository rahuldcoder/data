-- @entity3 's proclamation of @entity4 without any reference to slavery was unacceptable , president @entity1 said in an interview broadcast friday			1
" well , you know , i 'm a big history buff			0
and i think that understanding the history of the @entity14 and understanding the history of the @entity16 is something that every @entity18 and every young @entity19 should be a part of , " he told @entity11 in an interview taped thursday			1
" now , i do n't think you can understand the @entity14 and the @entity16 unless you understand slavery			1
and so , i think that was a -- an unacceptable omission			2
i think the governor 's now acknowledged that			0
" @entity1 was referring to @entity3 gov. @entity27 , who apologized wednesday for leaving out any reference to slavery in his recent proclamation designating april as @entity4 , calling it a " major omission			1
" @entity27 , a @entity33 , also said he would amend the proclamation			1
@entity11 asked the nation 's first @entity19 - @entity19 president to weigh in on the controversy			0
" i think it 's just a reminder that when we talk about issues like slavery that are so fraught with pain and emotion , that we 'd better do so thinking through how this is going to affect a lot of people , and their sense of whether they 're part of a commonwealth or part of our broader society			0
" @entity27 's written apology said , " the failure to include any reference to slavery was a mistake , and for that i apologize to any fellow @entity3 who has been offended or disappointed			1
" " the abomination of slavery divided our nation , deprived people of their @entity67 - given inalienable rights , and led to the @entity16 , " the statement said			1
" @entity69 was an evil , vicious and inhumane practice which degraded human beings to property , and it has left a stain on the soul of this state and nation			0
" the new language added to the proclamation says that " it is important for all @entity81 to understand that the institution of slavery led to this war and was an evil and inhumane practice that deprived people of their @entity67 - given inalienable rights			2
" it adds that " all @entity81 are thankful for its permanent eradication from our orders			0
" @entity27 's statement noted that while @entity3 was home to the capital of the @entity14 , it was also the first state in the nation to elect an @entity19 governor , @entity98 , whom @entity27 called " my friend			1
" in an interview with @entity0 on wednesday , @entity98 said @entity27 's apology and his introduction of additional proclamation language was " the right thing for him to have done			2
" " most people recognize that slavery was the cause of the [ @entity110 ] war , " @entity98 said , noting that @entity27 had called him wednesday			2
" the war was not a glorious thing in our past			0
it was something that we were able to withstand in terms of tearing the country apart			0
... thank @entity67 that war ended with the @entity14 losing			0
" not all of @entity98 's fellow @entity120 were willing to forgive @entity27 so quickly wednesday			2
" he has a right to apologize , " @entity3 state sen. @entity121 , who is also @entity19 , told @entity0 on wednesday			2
" but i do n't accept that as a good answer , because this is a pattern of this governor			2
" he says the wrong thing , he sends a signal to his base , and then he makes an apology , " @entity121 said			0
" it 's a question of whether or not he 's sincere or not			0
" @entity27 is the first @entity3 governor in eight years to issue a proclamation declaring april as @entity4			1
two previous @entity120 administrations refused to do so			0
" it is important for all @entity81 to reflect upon our @entity138 's shared history , to understand the sacrifices of the @entity14 leaders , soldiers and citizens during the period of the @entity16 , and to recognize how our history has led to our present , " the proclamation reads in part			1
former @entity3 gov. @entity147 , now the @entity148 chairman , issued a statement wednesday blasting the exclusion of slavery from the original proclamation			1
" governor @entity27 's decision to designate april as @entity4 without condemning , or even acknowledging , the pernicious stain of slavery or its role in the war disregards history , is insensitive to the extraordinary efforts of @entity18 to eliminate slavery and bind the nation 's wounds , and offends millions of @entity18 of all races and in all parts of our nation , " @entity147 wrote			1
" a failure to acknowledge the central role of slavery in the @entity14 and deeming insignificant the reprehensible transgression of moral standards of liberty and equality that slavery represented is simply not acceptable in the @entity18 of the 21st century , " he continued .			0
