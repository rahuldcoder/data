-- what 's white and black , and has people fawning all over ? @entity3 , a polar bear cub born in captivity in @entity6			1
the cute cub is being reared by handlers at the @entity9 because his mother is n't producing the milk to feed him			1
since his birth last month , @entity3 has become a web star			2
he has his own page on the park 's website and he 's even on @entity21			0
park director @entity22 says he 's stunned by the cub 's rapid transformation into an @entity26 sensation			1
video footage posted on @entity29 bottle - feeding , rolling around and snoozing has been viewed more than 2 million times in six days , he told @entity0 , and the cub gained thousands of friends on @entity21 within the space of a few hours			1
as of wednesday , at 36 days old , @entity3 has just opened his eyes and weighs in at 4.2 kilograms ( 9.2 pounds ) , more than five times his initial weight , his handler said			1
" he 's just a little solid cannonball , " @entity22 said			0
" he 's doing well			0
" such growth is a testament to the dedicated care @entity3 is receiving			2
for the first three weeks , @entity22 fed the cub every two hours -- and still feeds him every three hours , meaning the keeper gets little sleep			0
in the new year , two other wildlife keepers will start to care for him , too , in shifts , making sure the cub is never alone during the first 12 months of his life			0
@entity3 's popularity comes at a time when concern over the plight of polar bears is at an peak			1
corporate giant @entity55 recently launched a campaign in conjunction with the @entity58 to raise awareness about the threat of climate change to polar bears ' @entity63 habitat			1
and @entity22 is determined @entity3 -- whose name means " sea ice " in @entity67 , an @entity69 language spoken in @entity67 -- will thrive so he can play a role in highlighting the risk			1
polar bears rely on sea ice in the @entity63 to hunt			1
" @entity3 is going to be an ambassador for polar bears , for global warming , " he said			1
@entity22 draws a contrast with the last polar bear cub to become an internet star , @entity80 's @entity79			0
that bear died suddenly at age 4 last march at @entity83 , to the sorrow of many worldwide who had followed the cub 's progress after he was abandoned by his mother and hand - raised by a zookeeper			2
the case of @entity79 was a disaster , @entity22 said , " because he was only ever used for selling tickets and teddy bears			0
" @entity3 will have a different mission , he says : using his cuteness to persuade people to listen to warnings about climate change and take steps to protect their planet			1
it could prove a powerful weapon			0
the cub has already appeared on front pages of newspapers around the world and graced international tv news bulletins			0
new pictures will be posted on the @entity9 's website thursday , @entity22 said , with the pictures likely to win him even more fans			0
@entity22 also hopes that the facilities the huge park can offer will make it possible for @entity3 to join its four other polar bears -- including @entity118 's mother -- as a normal adult male in three or four years ' time , despite being bottle - reared			1
this is doubly important because of a shortage of polar bears for breeding programs in captivity -- set to become ever more important as the numbers in the wild drop			2
scientists believe there could be as few as 25,000 polar bears left in the world , according to @entity131 , a conservation group			2
the animals are only found in five nations : the @entity135 ( @entity136 ) , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity67 , the group said			0
in 2008 , the @entity140 listed the polar bear as threatened under the @entity142			0
without action , @entity22 says , research suggests that there could be no polar bears at all in the wild within 40 years			2
he hopes @entity3 can help reverse that course .			0
