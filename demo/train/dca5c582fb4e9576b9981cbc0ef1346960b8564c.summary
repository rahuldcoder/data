-- @entity0 's intrepid restaurant scout @entity1 hit the road to determine the top 100 places to eat in the @entity4 now			1
the list leads with the @entity4 's 10 best new restaurants and continues with @entity1 's favorite restaurants for 2014 , both new and old , in her most frequented towns			1
this list is always evolving , so follow @ jennifervcole on @entity11 for her latest stops			1
@entity14 asked @entity15 how she arrived at the larger and more pared down lists			1
" the whole list is a mix of both established restaurants and newcomers in alphabetical order			1
for each restaurant in the top 100 , i asked myself first and foremost ' is the food delicious ? ' i then considered the restaurant 's relevance in the modern food landscape			1
i took into account a chef 's technical skill and his or her creativity with ingredients			1
@entity36 obviously played a role ; i included restaurants within the @entity39 ( 17 states plus @entity41 )			1
and i factored in the overall experience , " @entity15 explained			1
@entity0 : secret recipes from the @entity4 's @entity44 for the 10 best new restaurants , @entity15 says the restaurant had to have opened between july 2013 and june 2014 to be considered			1
she visited each anonymously and @entity0 paid for all of her meals			1
" i traveled nearly 24,000 miles while researching this list , " said @entity15			1
" of course , i applied the same stringent criteria as with the overall list			1
in addition , i considered what each new restaurant contributes to the patchwork quilt of @entity39 food			2
how does it draw on and respect tradition ? how does it reflect today 's influences ? how does it apply the flavors of the modern @entity4 ? " @entity0 : 88 @entity63 and @entity15 found some trends emerging throughout her travels , notably a relaxing from the white tablecloth , tasting menu , suit - wearing waiters that had been a hallmark of some @entity39 dining until recently			1
so what did she find ? " more open kitchens , exposed wood , and waitstaff in jeans and button - downs			1
that 's not to say service is diminished or we 're relegated to burgers			1
i just think we 're in a period that 's less about fine dining and one that 's more about casual grace or fine casual			1
" and now that you know how the list - making sausage got made , let 's get to the main course			1
@entity0 : what 's your @entity91 ? 10			1
the shack -- @entity94 , @entity95 what to order : @entity97 with @entity99 peas , a soft - cooked egg , and hot sauce vinaigrette			2
at @entity104 's shotgun - style restaurant in tiny @entity94 , @entity95 , he serves up designer dishes from , quite frankly , the sticks			1
with the lamb shank , @entity104 layers fresh ( sweet green peas ) , rich ( a crisp puck of meaty goodness ) , and creamy ( a perfectly cooked runny egg ) to produce a model of simple decadence			2
most days , the hand - written menu reads like a bipolar expression of flavors : cold ramen with razor clams and a pickled egg listed above chili cheese fries			2
burgers alongside @entity123 with pulled rabbit , morels , ramps , and mustard			1
but on friday and saturday nights , @entity104 switches to a three - course prix fixe menu that highlights not only the seasonal bounty of rural @entity95 but also his impressive talents behind the stove			2
105 @entity133 ; @entity134 / theshacksva 9			2
@entity135 -- @entity136 , @entity137 what to order : grilled @entity139 with mezcal lime butter , and the @entity141			2
influences from @entity143 to western @entity144 have long informed how @entity4 eat			1
today , it 's @entity146 and @entity147 that are most shaping the modern @entity4			1
at @entity150 , chef / owner @entity148 , an outspoken proponent of the all - inclusive table , highlights the vibrant @entity152 traditions through a soft - focus @entity39 lens			2
and executive chef @entity154 transforms the @entity39 pantry into a fiery amalgamation of cross-cultural flavors			2
oysters from @entity139 waters sizzle with tangy mezcal lime butter			2
in the pozole , chunks of silken pork bathe in a red chile broth with @entity166 hominy , escarole , and fresh radish slices			2
1653 @entity169 ; @entity170 @entity0 : the @entity4 's @entity171 8			1
@entity172 -- @entity173 , @entity174 what to order : @entity176 with pickled green beans and mango - habanero mojo			2
at chef @entity180 ' modern take on haute @entity152 , expect creative riffs on traditional dishes			2
you 'll find ceviches , tacos , empanadas , and the like , but with modern interpretations			0
with the @entity176 , the fish is split and stuffed with a spiky fistful of tempura - battered pickled green beans and placed atop a chunky mango - habanero mojo			0
the @entity193 , served in a halved coconut shell , arrives scented with kaffir and studded with sweet coconut			0
the @entity197 , a mole - rich expression of a tamale , is stuffed with wild boar and topped with cherry salsita			0
@entity172 showcases chef @entity180 ' current obsession with @entity205 and @entity206 flavors , with perfect measures of ingenuity and restraint			0
# 100 , 2100 @entity210 ; @entity211 7			0
@entity213 's @entity212 -- @entity214 , @entity91 what to order : @entity216			1
i like to think of @entity212 as a stylish gastropub with righteous charcuterie			0
but that almost undersells it			0
the craft beer program is unparalleled in @entity223 , with some 40 - odd beers on tap , including a handful made in - house , and over 30 bottled options			0
the cocktail program is relentlessly ambitious			0
and dishes like the buttermilk fried wings , the pickled shrimp on rye bread , and the roasted - and - smoked chicken with cornbread pudding demonstrate the kitchen 's finesse with classic grub			1
but it 's the outliers — creamy spiced turnip custard , lemony chicken porridge with poached shrimp , braised lamb meatballs with apricots — that make me want to return			1
1081 @entity247 ; @entity248 6			0
@entity249 -- @entity173 , @entity174 what to order : @entity251			0
at this meat - centric , @entity174 - style brasserie , you ca n't go wrong with the roasted pig head			1
it arrives at the table — snout , ears , and all — crisp and fatty atop a wooden plank			0
for anyone who loves a proper pig pickin ' , this is your tableside porcine dream			0
wrap the rich and smoky meat in fresh tortillas , pile on crunchy bits of skin , and top with radishes and roasted tomatillo salsa			0
@entity272 to come with friends — this dish is meant to be shared			0
1530 @entity275 ; @entity276 @entity0 : 75 most stylish @entity4 5			1
rhubarb -- @entity278 , @entity279 what to order : @entity281 in a @entity282 with @entity283 and @entity284			0
@entity285 , the chef who shone a light on @entity288 foodways at @entity289 , emerged last fall with @entity291 in @entity278			0
touchstones of his legacy ( @entity295 's bacon , @entity297 trout ) are there			1
but @entity291 is no history lesson			0
he digs deep into the region 's traditions , adds global influence , and highlights the local larder			1
@entity295 's bacon shows up in a bowl of mussels in a silken celery - fennel broth			1
the roasted whole trout bathes in wood smoke before joining a crisp potato - celeriac latke			0
at @entity310 , @entity285 put @entity39 foodstuffs on the map			0
at @entity291 , he 's showing just how far he can stretch them			1
the @entity316 -- @entity317 , @entity91 what to order : @entity319 and @entity320 or @entity321 though the wood - fired pizzas and pastas conjure @entity325 , @entity322 relies mightily on the flavors of the @entity327			0
under the @entity332 section , @entity322 ' command of flavor as sense of place shines			0
oyster mushrooms from the nearby @entity334 join earthy kale and a runny @entity337 egg under shards of @entity339			0
favas and peas sit atop ricotta made with milk from @entity344 , accented with sea salt from nearby @entity346			0
2063 middle street ; @entity347 3			0
the 404 kitchen -- @entity349 , @entity350 what to order : the @entity353 chef @entity354 calls his brand of cooking fresh and uncomplicated , but there 's some cloaked modesty there			1
everything about this industrial - chic 40 - seater blends functionality , novelty , and a little " i 'm with the band , but i 'm not the rock star " attitude			0
in the @entity353 , simple slices of cobia are dotted with pickled strawberries , pea tendrils , and @entity371 almonds			0
for his @entity372 , @entity354 envelops lemony ricotta in a toasted cornmeal crust , and piles on heirloom tomatoes — a twist on tomato pie without any pretension			0
much like @entity349 these days , it 's all familiar — but new			2
404 12th @entity381 ; the404nashville.com / kitchen 2			0
@entity383 -- @entity41 what to order : @entity385 scrambled @entity386			0
for chef / owner @entity388 , luxury is n't about fine china and @entity390 poured in unison			2
" it 's how you feel , how people treat you , " he says			2
and as a result there 's a homey — never folksy — sophistication that resonates throughout the restaurant			2
the custardy bowl of scrambled eggs makes a decadent leap with briny , rich layers of uni ( sea urchin ) : pureed , sliced , and whisked into hollandaise			0
as with anything , it all boils down to the execution			0
and so far , @entity411 's is doing luxury right			2
@entity414 -- @entity415 , @entity137 what to order : oysters and absinthe - based cocktails			0
i 've yet to see another spot in the @entity4 with such a thoughtful — and joyful — oyster program			1
the menu lists , give or take , 22 oyster varieties , most sourced from small family farms and flown in daily , with the kinds of tasting notes more frequently reserved for wine lists			0
the @entity428 from @entity429 , @entity41 , are likened to " anise and buttered truffle " ; the @entity432 from @entity433 , @entity95 , " salted parsnip and green onion			0
" and local bar hero @entity436 wields his magic wand with drinks like the @entity439 , a heady yet refreshing mix of absinthe , lime , pineapple , tarragon , and bubbles			0
