-- when @entity2 sen. @entity1 made his closely - watched walk up the 45 @entity4 steps thursday , his progress was slowed more by all the well - wishers than by the fact that he had to re-learn how to walk this past year			1
the 53 - year - old @entity7 from @entity8 suffered a massive stroke last january			1
he underwent three separate brain surgeries at @entity11			0
then he started an intensive kind of physical therapy at the @entity14 , including a nine - week long mobility study			1
" it 's impressive to watch him , especially when you have a guy who was so impaired when he began , " said @entity16 , a research scientist and director of research for @entity14 's @entity19 , the unique program which treated @entity1			1
after enrolling in a research study , he soon began walking about 3,600 steps a day			2
senator makes emotional return to @entity4 after stroke " it was a very high - intensity program and we kept pushing him			1
we even had him on the @entity34 -- even i hate doing the @entity34 at the gym , " @entity16 said			0
overall , the exercise regimen could be difficult for even the most able - bodied person			0
but by july 12 , @entity1 was able to walk without a cane or harness			1
in november , he even walked up 37 stories to get to the top of @entity43 's tallest skyscraper for a fundraiser			0
@entity1 's inability to walk at first following his stroke is typical			1
only 37 % of survivors are able to walk in their first week after suffering a stroke , according to a @entity51 study			2
even patients with mild to moderate impairment experience falls			2
some 73 % of stroke patients fall at least once due to the stroke 's lingering effects , according to the study			1
people with less mobility can experience increased vascular risk factors due to lack of exercise that can lead to diabetes or even further strokes			0
in the past , doctors were n't entirely sure how much stroke patients should push themselves physically			1
still today , only half of the 800,000 people who suffer strokes annually receive any kind of rehabilitation , according to @entity69 , a stroke expert at the @entity70			1
but studies show there is an immediate need for physical therapy and exercise			2
" there was a time when we did n't think people should try moving right away , and there was a time when we were n't sure people really should be pushing themselves physically , " @entity69 said , " but we 've seen people make remarkable progress with therapy			2
" robotic system may help stroke patients research suggests rehabilitation work should start in the acute care hospital as early as 24 to 48 hours after a stroke			1
" that 's where we see the best outcome and the most opportunity because the brain is still adapting to the injury then , " @entity69 said			0
each stroke is different , so therapy must be tailor - made to that individual			1
@entity1 's stroke impacted the right side of his brain , which affected his left arm , left leg and the left side of his face			1
he underwent therapy that targeted the mobility of his arm			2
speech therapy improved the challenges he had talking because of the impact the stroke had on his face			1
and then there was his intensive walking therapy			2
the walking program was different than standard physical therapy , according to @entity16			0
in standard physical therapy , a patient does a lot of stretching and then goes through different physical steps like sitting and standing before they try and walk			2
" in this case we said , ' forget those stepping stones			0
let 's go ahead and walk him and all the posture and control will get better , ' " @entity16 said			0
" it was a novel approach and it worked			0
" @entity1 was an extremely determined patient			2
not all are , according to @entity16			0
" if people are not horribly determined , though , we have ways of tricking them			0
it 's not unlike being a coach on a sports team -- you just have to relate to a person and figure out what gets them moving , but the important thing is to get them moving			0
" physical rehabilitation ca n't " cure " a person completely			0
@entity1 will continue to use a four - pronged cane like the one he used on the @entity4 steps			1
he will use a wheelchair for longer distances			0
but @entity69 said the attention paid to @entity1 's story should help other stroke patients			1
" after intense therapy , i 've seen some people ski and run marathons , " @entity69 said			0
" seeing immense progress like this should give people real hope			0
