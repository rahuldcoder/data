@entity0 , @entity1 -- i first visited @entity1 in 1990 , just after the end of communist rule			1
back then , the @entity6 meant everything to people here : freedom , protection , opportunity , hope			2
i worked for @entity14 at the time			0
that business card resonating with capitalism opened every door			0
it even persuaded a border official not to pass my camera through a @entity22 - era x-ray machine			0
twenty years later , @entity1 has become a stable democracy			2
it has joined @entity25 and the @entity26			1
true , wages remain low by @entity29 standards			0
and to the eye , @entity1 still shows the scars of its communist past : half the population still lives in communist - era high - rise slabs			0
but things get better every year , visibly better even than during my last visit two years ago : new homes , new stores , improved roads , new stations opened on the @entity43 subway			0
@entity1 scored the highest growth in the whole @entity26 in 2009 , suffering not a single quarter of negative growth during the global recession			1
so that 's all good news for the @entity1			0
now the thought - provoking news for @entity6 : @entity6 's place on the @entity1 mental map seems to shrink every year			1
when @entity1 dream of leaving the country , they think not of @entity55 but of @entity56			0
a pole can work legally in any large @entity26 country , and an estimated 1 million do , sending home more money than @entity1 earns from all its @entity6 trade			1
meanwhile , @entity1 need a visa even to visit the @entity6			1
@entity1 business is oriented toward @entity64 , by far the country 's largest trading partner and investor			0
@entity1 buys and sells less with the @entity6 than it does with the @entity68			1
theoretically , the @entity6 remains very important to @entity1 's security			1
through @entity25 , the @entity6 has guaranteed defending @entity1 against @entity70 , with nuclear weapons if necessary			1
but @entity70 is behaving itself well toward @entity1 these days			0
when @entity70 did behave badly -- for example , embargoing @entity1 meat exports in 2005 -- it was the threat of @entity76 economic retaliation that changed @entity70 minds			0
the @entity6 has opened new military bases in southeastern @entity76 -- in @entity79 and @entity80 , but none in @entity1			1
there are practically no @entity6 soldiers stationed here			0
if anything , @entity1 might feel that they are doing much more for the @entity6 than the @entity6 does for @entity1			1
@entity1 troops fought in @entity86 , and fight now in @entity87			0
@entity1 support for @entity6 geopolicy has twice ended in humiliation for @entity1 governments			1
in 2005 , sources inside the @entity6 government leaked the news that @entity1 was permitting the @entity95 to detain captured @entity97 terrorists in secret in @entity1 prisons			1
@entity1 was threatened with the loss of its @entity26 voting rights and subjected to an @entity26 investigation			2
then in 2009 , the new @entity104 administration abruptly canceled a proposed @entity6 missile defense system based in @entity1 and the @entity68			2
these experiences would cause any future @entity1 governments to worry that cooperation with the @entity6 will horribly backfire on them			2
some waning of @entity6 prestige in @entity1 was inevitable			2
with the end of the @entity112 , @entity1 naturally worry more about earning a living than protecting their security			2
and of course , next - door @entity64 offers more economic benefits than faraway @entity6			0
of course , too , the @entity6 has banked a huge store of goodwill in @entity1 that will take years to deplete			1
it was the @entity6 that championed @entity1 's independence from @entity119 while anxious @entity64 urged that the @entity6 stop annoying the @entity120 with talk of freedom			2
but although inevitable and gradual , the dwindling of @entity6 importance , not only in @entity1 but in other liberated countries in central @entity76 as well , is a real and large fact of life			1
that fact might matter less if there were other regions of the world where @entity6 's clout was increasing			0
but where ? the opinion expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity136 .			0

@entity136 visited *post-communist* @entity1 in 1990 ; nation was eager to connect with @entity6
now , 20 years later , democratic @entity1 part of @entity26 , @entity25 ; @entity6 seems less central in importance
@entity1 has closer *connections* in @entity26 , he says , have had *awkward* *political* moments with @entity6
@entity147 : @entity6 still key to security , has goodwill *history* with @entity1 , but its importance dwindling
