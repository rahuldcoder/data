-- last week , federal immigration authorities seized more than a dozen @entity3 stores in @entity4 and @entity5			1
authorities charged that the stores ' franchisees " brutally exploited " more than 50 undocumented immigrant workers			1
the workers allegedly worked up to 100 hours a week , for as little as $ 3 an hour			0
they were forced to live in housing the employers owned and controlled , authorities said			2
for many , it was a shock			0
an iconic @entity15 corporation was allegedly profiting from what the @entity15 attorney 's office called a " modern - day plantation system			0
" prosecutors are seeking $ 30 million in forfeiture , not only from the franchisees but also from the @entity3 parent corporation			2
the real shock should be how common cases such as this have become			0
millions of immigrant workers are uniquely vulnerable to abuse , because employers can threaten them with retaliatory firing and deportation to silence complaints			1
in this context , the allegations that @entity3 ran a " plantation system " for 13 years sounds more plausible			2
consider : in march , workers from several nations filed federal complaints describing similar exploitation at @entity41 's restaurants in central @entity42			0
the workers , students who had come to the @entity15 with j - 1 visas to work under the @entity45 , reported brutal conditions , wage theft and shifts of up to 25 hours straight with no overtime pay			2
they said they were made to live in substandard housing owned by the employer , and faced threats of deportation when they raised concerns			0
in june 2012 , another group of immigrant workers alleged forced labor at a @entity60 @entity59 supplier called @entity61			1
supervisors threatened to beat them with a shovel , they said , to make them work faster , and when they spoke up , the boss allegedly threatened violence against their families			0
recent debate on the @entity70 floor also recalled an emblematic 2011 case of exploitation at a @entity74 packing plant in @entity42			0
there , immigrant guest workers said in a federal complaint that they earned subminimum wage take - home pay and faced constant threats of firing and deportation			2
among the many similarities in these cases , most striking is that all four came to light because immigrant workers defied threats and blew the whistle			1
when they did , they stood up not just for themselves , but for @entity15 workers as well			0
in a recent national survey of 1,000 registered voters by @entity95 ( a coalition of pro-reform groups of which the @entity97 is a member ) , 75 % agreed that " if employers are allowed to get away with mistreating immigrant workers , it ends up lowering wages and hurting conditions for @entity15 workers as well			1
" eighty percent agreed that " immigrant workers who blow the whistle on abusive employers are helping defend workplace standards , and should have the opportunity to stay in the @entity15 to work toward citizenship			1
" right now , protections for immigrant whistle - blowers are weak			1
@entity111 routinely ignores a memorandum from its director , @entity113 , allowing it not to pursue deportation against whistle - blowers			1
in @entity119 , 26 workers who helped expose exploitation in the @entity60 home elevation industry were arrested in an immigration raid in august 2011 , and most are still fighting their deportations today			0
across the country , workers who have been the victims of exploitation -- and have come forward to stop it -- are treated as disposable			0
immigration reform needs to change that			2
first , as the bill moves through the @entity70 and on to the @entity130 , it needs to include provisions that deliver dignity at work to the more than 7 million immigrant workers in the @entity15 -- and that keep the floor from falling for the 150 million @entity15 - born workers who work alongside them			1
a bill called the @entity139 would provide the key protections to both			0
it needs to be included in the immigration reform bill			2
second , immigration reform must deliver equal rights to all immigrant workers , so that unscrupulous employers ca n't pick and choose the most exploitable workers to undercut the competition			1
all immigrant workers who come to the @entity15 through future guest - worker programs must have strong whistle - blower protections and the right to change employers as freely as any worker on @entity15 shores			1
raising the floor for the immigrant workers at the bottom of the @entity15 economy means building a stronger , more secure economy for all workers			1
that 's why protecting immigrant workers does n't just matter for immigrants			1
it matters for every worker in @entity15			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity168 : authorities seized some @entity3 stores , saying immigrants exploited
he says immigrants vulnerable to abuse from employers and whistle - blowers risk *punishment*
he says any immigration reform should provide protections for guest - worker whistle - blowers
@entity184 : equal rights for immigrant workers means strong economy for all workers
