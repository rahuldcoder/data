@entity0 -- firefighters , sailors and emergency workers reflected friday on the scenes they witnessed during rescue efforts for the passengers of a @entity9 jet that ditched into the @entity11 's frigid waters the day before			1
divers plunge into the icy waters of the @entity11 on thursday to rescue passengers from the ditched aircraft			1
it was far from just another day in @entity0 , a city that has experienced its fair share of emergency calls			2
" it was like a movie set , " said @entity19 of @entity20 1			2
" we 're at a @entity25 base , over a computer			2
@entity27 says ' plane crash			2
@entity11 , over 15th street			2
' " @entity19 rushed to the scene and began working on transporting some of the 155 passengers on @entity31 , many of them displaying signs of distress			1
" i said ' welcome to @entity0 , ' and a couple of them cracked a smile , " he said			2
" they were just glad to be warm and dry			0
" detective @entity39 , the head diver for the @entity41 @entity40 , was lowered into the @entity11 from a helicopter in full scuba gear to rescue a woman hanging onto a floating object in the water			1
" she seemed to be at the most distress at the time , " @entity47 said on @entity1 's " @entity48			0
" " they put us down to about 10 , 15 feet off the water			1
and that 's when we jumped into the water , " @entity47 said			1
" man , i 've been in cold water , but nothing like that			1
" darting speed boats and fighting strong currents was no easy job , said his partner , detective @entity61			1
" our first focus is to get a bit of communication established between us , kind of a game plan , " @entity61 said			0
" it comes down sometimes to hand signals and a tap on the shoulder , a point of a finger			0
" the unidentified woman was reluctant to let go of the net she was holding on to but eventually wrapped her arms around her rescuers			1
she was later treated for hypothermia , @entity47 said			0
" if there 's going to be a victim in the water , this is probably the worst time of year for them to be in the water , " @entity47 said			2
" these people were literally in just regular clothes , obviously			0
they were just taking a flight on an airline and wearing a sweater , maybe some jeans , some sneakers			0
" petty officer @entity91 recalled sailing alongside the airplane over icy waters to rescue passengers , some partially submerged in the near - freezing waters			1
" i actually put my boat inside the plane , " said @entity91 , who was one of the first to arrive at the crash scene			2
@entity91 and his crew , who plucked seven people out of the wreckage , praised the crews of the fast - moving swarm of commuter ferries that transported many of the passengers away from the sinking aircraft			1
@entity110 , a ferry operations manager , credited a hammock - like maritime rescue tool called a @entity114 cradle with helping save passengers from the water as quickly as possible			1
while @entity110 was helping people out of the water , he quickly turned his attention to a mother attempting to climb into a raft with her infant			1
" she climbed almost all the way up onto the boat , " he said			0
" she did n't have the strength , so we muscled her on			0
the baby was right back in her arms , and she was back inside real quick			0
" @entity132 capt. @entity131 's daily work consists of ferrying commuters from @entity134 to @entity0 's financial centers and basic ports			0
rescue was a new mission to @entity139 , who said freezing weather and the river 's currents made the task more challenging			1
" you had to maneuver the boat with the current , because the plane is going downriver , " @entity131 told @entity1 's " @entity148			0
" " and you had to make sure there was no one next to you or inside			0
" other rescue workers who raced to save passengers also looked back on thursday 's rescue mission in disbelief			2
" we heard it was a confirmed plane down			0
initially , you think of a small @entity156 - type plane , but when we got up on the scene , i saw the tail fin of a @entity9 jet out of the water , " @entity0 firefighter @entity19 said			1
" as @entity19 approached the partially submerged aircraft with passengers clustered on its wings , he was struck by the " organized " and " calm " atmosphere of the rescue efforts already underway			1
" there 's been helicopters that have gone down in the @entity170 the last few years			0
but to handle this -- this is a large airliner with this many people , it worked out well			0
i was amazed that no one was killed			0

" i 've been in cold water , but nothing like that , " @entity41 diver says
