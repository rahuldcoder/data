under the laws of the @entity5			0
we enjoy the same status as our straight married neighbors			0
despite being legally married , we are prevented by the federal @entity9 ( @entity9 ) from filing joint federal tax returns and denied the right to @entity13 survivor benefits , among many other federal legal rights available to opposite - sex married couples			1
we are as equally married as our straight counterparts but lack equal rights when it comes to the benefits of marriage			0
@entity9 has the same rights - limiting effect on same - sex married couples in each of the jurisdictions where same - sex marriage is legal : @entity5 and six states -- @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
same - sex marriage is set to be legal in @entity36 next week and in @entity37 in january			2
last week , the @entity39 , sitting in @entity38 , ruled that @entity9 's denial to same - sex couples of federal benefits enjoyed by straight couples in @entity29 is unconstitutional			1
the court said that there was " a lack of any demonstrated connection between @entity9 's treatment of same - sex couples and its asserted goal of strengthening the bonds and benefits to society of heterosexual marriage			1
" " moral disapproval " can not by itself form the grounds for discriminatory legislation , said the court			0
notably , the court did not declare any constitutional right to same - sex marriage , and it did not adopt the argument made by the plaintiffs that @entity9 was motivated purely by bias against gay people			1
rather , the court looked at the case narrowly as one involving a state where same - sex marriage is legal and a federal law limiting the rights available to a certain category of couples married under state law			1
after a searching review of the purpose of the law and the legislative history , the court found @entity9 constituted a federal intrusion into an area traditionally handled by state law -- the issue of marriage and the rights flowing from it			2
and the court concluded there obviously was a disparate impact on a minority group , same - sex couples			2
as the court 's opinion explained , " rather than challenging the right of states to define marriage as they see fit , [ the case is about ] the right of @entity102 to undercut the choices made by same - sex couples and by individual states in deciding who can be married to whom			1
" in other words , the case was about whether @entity102 has any business limiting the legal effect of same - sex marriages as a matter of federalism once a state determines such marriages are to be permitted			2
the court said that " one virtue of federalism is that it permits this diversity of governance based on local choice , " a principle that " applies as well to the states that have chosen to legalize same - sex marriage " as to those that have prohibited it			1
this is where the court avoided ruling on whether same - sex marriage is constitutionally required under equal protection in states banning it , or whether other states need to recognize same - sex marriages performed elsewhere			1
focusing on the federalism issue , the court found that @entity102 had not established a legitimate reason for interfering with the state of @entity29 ' regulation of marriage			0
and it concluded there was no justifiable relationship between the " defense " of straight marriage and denying the benefits of marriage available to people of the same sex legally married under state law			0
so while this case ends up being a victory for the rights of same - sex married couples in @entity29 ( although the ruling immediately was put on hold pending @entity163 review ) , its legal reasoning was decidedly conservative , based on a state 's rights			1
the author of the opinion , judge @entity166 , also is known as a conservative			0
he is a former official in president @entity170 's @entity169 and was appointed to the bench by president @entity172			0
another judge on the three - judge panel deciding the case was appointed by @entity170			0
in writing the opinion for the court , @entity166 said : " invalidating a federal statute is an unwelcome responsibility for federal judges , " a reflection of his and his fellow judges ' judicial conservatism			0
indeed , far from a case of judicial activism , this recent gay marriage case is one built on a foundation even the @entity189 would admire and written by a judge whose background they would approve			2
thus , the oft - heard claim from social conservatives that same - sex marriage and the legal rulings upholding it are the products of left - wing activist judges is belied by the most recent judicial ruling on the subject , from a majority comprised of conservative judges and with reasoning conservatives frequently invoke to support state rights and to resist the impact of federal laws			1
epilogue : also in @entity38 this month , the @entity209 was given by the @entity210 to three former justices of the @entity212 who were part of the unanimous court establishing same - sex marriage in @entity31 as a constitutional right under state law , and who were removed from office after a $ 1 million campaign against them by conservatives			2
the @entity38 judges behind this week 's ruling enjoy life tenure under @entity225 of the @entity226 and will not be subjected to such vilification			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			0

@entity230 in same - sex marriage in @entity5 , but he says @entity9 denies him rights
he says appeals court recently ruled @entity9 *unconsitutional* in @entity29
he says ruling victory for same - sex couples but reasoning was conservative
@entity230 : far from judicial activism , ruling was by conservative judges backing local choice
