@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's the beginning of the second semester in public schools across @entity1 and students are flocking back after the vacation			1
but in most of @entity10 , the heartland of the militant group @entity9 , the desks are empty and the playing fields are quiet			1
western education is a sin in the eyes of the terror group --- and nowhere has that message more clearly hit home than in their recent horrific attack on @entity20			0
only the walls of the classrooms , library and science laboratories remain : a charred shell of what was once , the pride of @entity0			1
but even more painful is the fact that more than 200 of the girls who took classes here are still missing , kidnapped from the school during that night of terror			1
@entity34 , a resident of @entity0 who witnessed the attack on his village , says he is too scared to take his daughters to school			1
since the attack he 's kept them at home , where he felt they would be safer			0
" i am scared of sending them to school , " he says			1
" i 'm not feeling good that they 're at home and i 'm not feeling good to send them to school because of the attacks			0
" @entity34 's dilemma mirrors that of almost every parent in @entity0 : torn between education for their child and their family 's safety			1
on the way to @entity0 from @entity61 , the country 's capital , travelers meet one police or military checkpoint after another			2
but join the main rough dirt road to @entity0 and the government security presence seems to taper off			2
it all leaves local residents feeling vulnerable and afraid			0
@entity34 could n't forgive himself if he sent his daughter to school and then heard that something had happened to her			2
" no one can afford losing their daughter , " he says			1
in an article on his website " @entity81 " @entity76 , the @entity77 special envoy for @entity78 , says 10.5 million children in @entity1 are yet to go to school and that the high levels of illiteracy are now an economic problem , as well as a social disaster , for the country			1
analysts say that if the @entity9 attacks on schools continue unabated then those levels of illiteracy will significantly increase , further compromising the future of the country 's young people			2
@entity2 interviewed one of the girls who managed to escape from @entity9 on the night they were taken from their dormitory			1
though she hopes to go back to school soon so she can fulfil her dream of becoming a doctor , she 's still very scared			2
" if in @entity0 , i 'll never go again , " she says			0
but like many families in the area her family is too poor to send her to a boarding school far away from the village			0
all the people in @entity0 seem to have left is hope			0
@entity34 prays a day will come when his daughters will be free to pursue their futures and become lawyers , doctors or engineers			0
" when i see all these people doing their jobs , i have the desire -- or the hope -- that i want my children to be like them , " he says			0
" i have very high hopes for them			0
