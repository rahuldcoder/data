@entity0 , @entity1 -- most football fans , if they are not already , will have to become rabid carnivores during their visit to @entity1 for the @entity7			1
@entity1 like their meat and they like to cook and eat it out in the open , under the clear blue skies			1
if you are invited to a " braai " or a " chisa nyama " you are basically going to a barbeque			0
there are variations on what you will be offered , depending on who is hosting you and where you are			0
in general , you will find yourself eating spicy sausages called " boerewors , " lamb chops and some " pap , " which looks like mashed potato but is maize meal			1
pap is often served with delicious tomato gravy			2
of course , the food is washed down with copious amounts of @entity1 beer			1
another meat staple in @entity1 is " biltong " -- which is a bit like beef jerky , but tastes much better			1
biltong is an excellent snack to nibble on as you journey through the country			1
try the kudu or ostrich biltong , or just stick to good old beef			1
either way , you can get addicted to the stuff			0
it is very more - ish			0
the key to eating well in @entity1 , or anywhere in the world , is simple : stick to local , fresh dishes			1
so i would not suggest that @entity53 football fans order grilled sole in @entity55 , which is nowhere near the sea			0
however , the @entity58 and @entity59 football fans have it lucky -- their teams are based in @entity62 , on the @entity63			0
so local oysters and fresh fish , such as the succulent @entity66 , should be on their menus			2
that said , except for @entity70 and the surrounding areas in the winelands which have sophisticated restaurant scene , most @entity1 food is simple and not fancy			1
so , stick to the basics at restaurants and a huge t - bone or a juicy fillet steak will not disappoint you			0
the prices might knock your socks off -- choice pieces of meat are much cheaper than in most capital cities			2
if you are looking for a quick meal on the way to a football match , munch on decent burgers from " steers " or delicious spicy chicken from " @entity90			2
" you should be able to find at least one of these eateries in most @entity1 towns			1
if you prefer a good - sized trendy sandwich packed with rocket leaves and other posh nosh , try the " @entity98 " chain			0
you can also get excellent takeaway coffee from the distinctive , red - and - white decorated " @entity101			0
" as far as fast - food joints go , all of these offer great food			0
@entity1 farms export fresh fruit and vegetables to @entity108 , so do not worry about getting sick from dirty germs that plague some travelers in developing countries			1
often , the food in @entity1 is fresher than the stuff you buy in supermarkets in @entity116 or elsewhere on the continent			2
during the winter here in the @entity119 , you will find loads of avocados on the shelves			0
stock up , because i think nothing tastes as delicious as in - season avos from the @entity128 region of the country			0
also , " mielies " are what the rest of the world call " corn on the cob			0
" @entity1 mielies are sweet and crunchy , so look out for them at a braai or when you go food shopping			2
do n't be a nervous eater when traveling to @entity1 , it would be a shame to miss out on the cheap , fresh produce available .			1

@entity1 love to cook lots of meat at *outdoor* barbecues known as " braais "
**popular** foods *include* spicy sausages called " boerewors , " lamb chops and " pap "
a cured meat similar to beef jerky known as " biltong " is also **popular** as a snack
@entity1 has plenty of fresh produce available , so do n't be a nervous eater
