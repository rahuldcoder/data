-- it was a " million to one odds " that the @entity12 women 's triathlon race would end in a photo finish , but the outcome is again in doubt following @entity5 's decision to appeal the result in sport 's last - resort court			1
the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) has appealed to the @entity16 following its failure to have @entity18 awarded the gold medal following last saturday 's event			1
@entity22 's @entity21 was adjudged to have crossed the line first after both women finished in one hour 59.43 seconds and was awarded victory despite protests from the @entity5			1
both the @entity15 and the @entity27 failed to have the decision overturned after filing an official complaint to the @entity30 ( @entity30 )			1
@entity18 's fate now rests in the hands of the @entity16 , which will make a decision on saturday in @entity34			2
the @entity30 told @entity0 it could not comment on the case until after the verdict			2
@entity38 brothers take triathlon by storm it was time an @entity12 triathlon has been settled in such a manner , and former @entity45 triathlete @entity44 was astonished by the close finish			1
" it was a million to one odds , " she told @entity0			2
" perhaps it 's a bit remiss of coaches not to work on the finishing styles of their athletes as one of the girls dipped her head and the other went with her chest			0
" i just think that nobody ever expected such a close finish because you would expect after two hours of competition that there would be a bigger gap			0
i 've never seen anything like it in all my time of watching triathlon			0
" @entity44 said that saturday 's decision will have a huge impact on the winner			1
" it 's a shame that it has gone to @entity16 because the race has gone and the medal ceremony can not be brought back , but you can not underestimate how much that gold medal means because it can change somebody 's life , " she said			2
" to normal people watching they just think about the race and some people will say that they should get on with it			0
" but that gold could mean â ‚ ¬ 100,000 ( $ 123,000 ) to somebody and that 's why the @entity5 team are possibly appealing			1
i 'm sure the @entity22 would have done the same if it had been the other way around			0
" now based in @entity86 , @entity44 has taken time out of her medical career to compete on the @entity89 circuit			0
a qualified doctor and a seven - time national rowing champion , she has competed in several triathlons and @entity94 competitions			0
" i love triathlon and i thought that the @entity12 race was gripping , " @entity44 said			1
" i was watching it with a lot of people who were n't fans of triathlon and now they absolutely love it			0
" i hope that the attention the sport is receiving will now help get people into it because it was really a wonderful spectacle			0
