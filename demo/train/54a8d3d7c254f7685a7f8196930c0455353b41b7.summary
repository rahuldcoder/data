-- @entity1 go to the polls on sunday march 4 to elect a new president			1
current prime minister @entity4 is attempting to regain the post he held between 1999 and 2008			1
he has been a dominant force in @entity1 politics for more than a decade but his popularity has suffered recent setbacks			2
so who is challenging him and what will the poll mean for @entity1 ? @entity0 examines some of the key questions			1
what is this one about ? @entity1 's top job -- that of president -- is being contested this time			1
it follows parliamentary elections in december in which @entity4 's ruling @entity21 received 49.5 % of the vote -- down from 64 % four years ago			1
it kept @entity21 in power in the lower house , called the @entity26 , with 238 of the 450 seats but also triggered major protests over allegations of vote rigging and ballot stuffing			0
@entity4 dismissed calls for a review , but the outgoing president @entity34 announced political reforms in the wake of large demonstrations			2
@entity4 is now seeking to regain the presidency which he has held twice before			2
@entity1 law prevents presidents serving more that two consecutive terms so he was obliged to stand down in 2008			2
how is the president elected ? there are effectively two systems in place			0
parties represented in parliament can nominate their own candidate -- others need to collect two million signatures of support that are then scrutinized by @entity1 's @entity52			1
four of the five standing this year are party nominees , while independent candidate , the billionaire @entity54 , garnered enough support to run for the post			0
to gain the presidency , the candidate must secure 50 % of the poll plus one vote			0
if this fails to happen there is a run - off between the two highest polling candidates in a second round of voting to be held within two weeks			2
so who is standing ? there are five candidates : @entity4 of the @entity21			2
a primary focus of his campaign has been modernizing @entity1 's military , saying it 's the only way to improve @entity1 standing in the world			1
@entity4 's political career @entity77 , nominated by the @entity78			2
this is his fourth attempt to gain election to the top office			2
@entity82 is standing for @entity83			0
he is left leaning and lost the 2004 race for the presidency			0
a right - winger , this is his fifth attempt to be elected president			0
the billionaire produced a manifesto of democratic and economic reforms but @entity0 's @entity96 correspondent @entity95 says he 's struggling to shake off his reputation for being too close to the current regime			1
metals mogul hoping to shine another candidate , @entity100 , of the non-parliamentary party @entity101 , was barred from standing by the @entity52 for invalid signatures -- a move his website suggests was politically motivated			0
who is likely win ? despite a drop in popularity , @entity0 correspondent @entity95 says @entity4 is very likely to regain the presidency			1
a recent poll for the @entity111 showed him to be on 55 % with none of the other candidates polling more than 10 %			0
@entity4 's drawing power @entity95 says although @entity4 is clear favourite to win , he can expect continued public dissent			1
" he 'll be leader of a country that has changed dramatically in the last three months , " he said			0
how long does the president serve ? the president is entitled to stay in office for six years			1
it used to be four years but the constitution was changed in 2008 to allow the extension to six			2
@entity1 presidents can not serve more than two consecutive terms			0
@entity4 can run again despite two previous presidencies as he is currently in the post of prime minister			1
how powerful is the president ? in @entity1 , the president is more powerful than the prime minister			1
professor @entity131 , an associate fellow of the @entity1 and @entity132 at @entity134 - based think - tank @entity133 , explains that the president is responsible for foreign policy and security and has the power to dismiss the prime minister			1
he says there are two key camps in this election -- those that see @entity4 as a safe pair of hands providing stability and security , and those that feel he has overstayed his welcome and want a " move away from heavy - handed political management			0
" the current president , @entity34 , has already been nominated for prime minister by @entity4 if he wins -- once again swapping roles			1
in december , @entity158 , a professor of political science at the @entity160 in the @entity161 , told @entity0 : " switching places , although hardly an inspired move , is the simplest way to stir the waters without fear of rocking the boat			0
yet the reality is that @entity4 's return to the @entity167 will not , in itself , change much			2
for the last four years , he has made all key decisions , with @entity34 's advice , and he will continue to do so			0
" professor @entity131 adds : " if @entity34 is prime minister i think he will continue to push through political reform			1
the prime minister is quite an important figure			1
" are there any fears about electoral fraud ? the parliamentary elections in december were marred by allegations of ballot stuffing with the @entity179 saying in a preliminary report that some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was " slanted in favor of the ruling party			0
" @entity161 secretary of state @entity185 said the @entity161 also had serious concerns			0
thousands of @entity1 turned out to protest			0
in response , @entity34 announced political reforms to address discontent			0
he proposed that @entity1 returned to direct election of regional governors ; simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates ; establish new editorially independent public tv channel ; and called for lifting of many of the political restrictions imposed in the past several years by @entity4			1
@entity95 reports that @entity4 wants to install 300,000 cameras in 90,000 polling stations at an estimated cost of $ 1 billion to prevent fraud			1
but @entity203 , a leading opposition figure , told @entity95 that they do n't have any confidence in what @entity4 says and believe the move to install cameras is a " gimmick			1
" what about wider corruption ? @entity34 has worked to stamp out corruption in @entity1 , signing a 2008 decree to counter its effects			2
despite this , @entity1 remains ranked 143rd out of 182 countries on a corruption perception index published by @entity217			0
@entity218 , founder and chairman of the @entity220 , told @entity0 in january that " the average citizen has experienced the brutality of corruption carried out day - to - day by an omnipresent and thuggish bureaucracy			0
" each year an estimated 15 - 20 % of @entity1 's economic output goes towards some sort of bribe - whether paying off tax authorities , the police or other local officials -- thus creating a significant drag on small businesses and innovation			1
" although @entity131 believes many in @entity1 never have to pay a bribe he added that there are others , particularly business people , who do have to			0
" the tolerance level has come to a point where they 've had enough of this			0
" if @entity34 returns as prime minister after the presidential election his reforms will be further tested .			1

five candidates are competing for @entity1 's top job
the president is entitled to stay in office for six years following rule changes in 2008
