@entity0 -- throughout my travels with @entity4 -- from @entity5 , to @entity6 , @entity7 , the @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 -- i have met countless young girls and boys whose bodies and minds have been permanently damaged because they were malnourished during the first 1,000 days of their lives			1
around 170 million children under the age of five are stunted -- their bodies and brains can not develop to full capacity			1
a stunted child has difficulty in learning and in surviving			0
such children are up to four times more likely to die from all causes -- including easily preventable diseases			2

but the suffering of some 170 million children constitutes a global catastrophe that calls for an urgent response			1
traveling for @entity4 for over more than a decade , my focus has been on countries -- particularly in @entity43 -- that are being impacted by conflict including the @entity47 region , @entity10 , @entity6 and the @entity8 -- areas convulsed by violence			0
i have met countless families who have nothing to eat because they are on the run often hiding deep in the bush			0

last february , i paid a second visit to the sand swept town of @entity63 in the west of @entity7 along the belt of the @entity66			0
drought , failed crops and skyrocketing food prices have left people with little to nothing to eat			0
mothers carry emaciated children long distances across the sand to reach @entity4 - supported health centers for life - saving fortified foods			2
often it is too late			0
at this moment one million children throughout the @entity66 region of @entity43 are at risk of dying			1
they are in urgent need of our support			0
wherever there is poverty , it is the children who pay the highest price			1
but here is a story of hope			0
when i visited @entity9 before the earthquake , the stunting rates had been stubbornly high -- about 31 %			1
then , on january 12 , 2010 , the earthquake struck causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries			1
the devastation affected three million people , two thirds of them children			1
but the @entity9 government and the international community joined forces and in just two years something extraordinary resulted			1
that stubborn stunting rate dropped to 23 %			2
there is more work to do , but we can see that even in challenging circumstances it is possible to work together to ensure that the world 's most vulnerable children , pregnant women and mothers have access to food and drinkable water			2
wherever i go , i am always struck by the children			0
in the face of their courage , resilience and hope , i do n't see how we can allow ourselves the luxury of feeling overwhelmed or helpless			0
we have the tools , we know what must be done			0
in the name of some 170 million children let 's pull together and end the obscenity of hunger and stunting .			1
