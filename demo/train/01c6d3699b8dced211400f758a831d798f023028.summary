-- this story is about a @entity4 senator 's alleged trips on a private plane to the @entity6 for sex parties with prostitutes			1
if it proves to be true , it would most likely topple a powerful politician and affect president @entity12 's ability to pass legislation			2
if it is false , it would raise questions about how government watchdog groups and the media handle anonymous tipsters and their information			1
the senator is @entity23 's @entity22 , a 59 - year - old divorced father of two who is set to become chairman of the @entity26			1
his @entity26 website calls @entity22 " a fighter for @entity23 families			1
" @entity22 denied the story in a statement issued wednesday by his @entity26 office : " any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically - motivated right - wing blog and are false			1
" the " right - wing blog " @entity22 is accusing of manufacturing the allegations is the @entity36 , an online publication founded by conservative commentator @entity38 and @entity39 , a former adviser to former vice president @entity40			1
the @entity36 published its first reports on the allegations in early november just before the election			2
the stories were based on interviews with two women and a @entity50 official -- all unidentified			0
that prompted a denial then by the @entity54 senator			0
but the latest allegations are based on documents published by a " non-partisan " @entity59 watchdog group -- @entity60 in @entity59 , known as @entity61			1
it would be a stretch to call @entity61 " right - wing , " considering executive director @entity65 served as minority counsel for the @entity67 under rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , before being hired by the @entity70 to be an assistant @entity4 attorney for the @entity59			2
in fact , a quick online search finds blogs accusing @entity61 of being a " left - wing " group			2
@entity61 published an e-mail this week it received last april from a man who identified himself as @entity78			1
" my duty as a @entity4 citizen obligates me to report what i consider to be a grave violation of the most fundamental codes of conduct that a politician of my country must follow , " the tipster wrote			2
e-mails sent by @entity78 included statements from women detailing what they said were sex parties in a house and on a yacht in the @entity50 owned by dr. @entity95 , a south @entity96 ophthalmologist			1
one e-mail purported to include a statement from a woman who said she was paid to have sex with the senator several times when she worked for " the @entity103 " escort service in the spring of 2009			0
prostitution is legal in the @entity50 , but only if the prostitute is 18 or older			0
@entity78 suggested that he and the women " will be willing to testify " about the allegations if their safety was guaranteed			1
his e-mail to @entity61 said he became aware of the alleged behavior while traveling in the @entity50 for " personal and business reasons " starting in 2008			0
@entity61 said it passed the " numerous " @entity78 e-mail exchanges on to the @entity70 and the @entity114 in july 2012 , after the group was " unable to independently verify the truth of the allegations			1
" but 10 months after the first contact with @entity78 , @entity65 told @entity0 her group now has doubts about @entity78 ' identity , motives and veracity			1
" this unnamed source said he has had this information about sen. @entity22 as early as 2008 , yet he did n't come forward until four years later , right before sen. @entity22 was up for re-election , " @entity65 said			1
" further , this source refused to ever speak by phone to us , with other news organizations , or with the @entity114 , so , those two facts combined to seriously undermine his credibility			2
" @entity0 efforts to reach @entity78 through the e-mail address used to contact @entity61 have been unanswered			2
it is not known whether the @entity114 succeeded in talking directly to @entity78 , but there was a very public indication this week that the agency is investigating @entity95			1
agents were seen carrying boxes from his @entity143 , @entity96 , office wednesday			0
an @entity114 spokesman in @entity96 confirmed there was " law enforcement activity " at the location where the search occurred but did not mention @entity95 or anyone else and did not explain what agents were investigating			0
in 2011 , the @entity153 hit @entity95 with an $ 11 million tax lien			0
" the government has not informed dr. @entity95 what concerns it may have , his lawyer @entity155 told @entity0 in an e-mail thursday			0
" we are confident that dr. @entity95 has acted appropriately at all times			0
additionally , any issues concerning dr. @entity95 and the @entity153 have been fully resolved and satisfied			0
" @entity22 calls @entity95 a friend and political supporter			2
he acknowledged flying on the eye doctor 's plane three times to the @entity50 in 2010 , trips that he said were " paid for and reported appropriately			0
" one of the trips involved official travel for the @entity171 , which he chairs , while the other two were personal trips , @entity22 's spokeswoman @entity168 said			1
the senator is not required to publicly disclose information concerning personal travel , she said			0
the senator made a payment of $ 58,500 from his personal funds to @entity95 's company on january 4 for the full operating costs of the two flights @entity22 took in august and september 2010 to the @entity50 , @entity168 said			1
it was an " oversight " on the part of the senator not to have paid for the flights at the time he took them , she said			0
@entity23 state sen. @entity188 , a @entity189 , sent a complaint to the @entity191 in november calling for an investigation , saying @entity22 may have violated @entity26 ethics by " repeatedly flying on a private jet to the @entity50 and other locations ... and soliciting prostitutes			1
" @entity188 said he did not hear back from the @entity191			2
at an event in @entity59 on thursday night , when asked by @entity0 whether be violated @entity26 finance rules , @entity22 said , " these are nameless , faceless , anonymous allegations			1
you should find out from them			0
" the @entity191 said it could not comment			2
@entity168 said the senator assumes the committee is reviewing the matter , but he has not been contacted			0
@entity0 asked senate majority leader @entity205 on thursday whether he thought @entity22 was handling the controversy properly			2
" first of all , @entity22 is my friend , " sen. @entity205 said			1
" he is an outstanding senator			0
he is now the new chair of the @entity26			0
any questions in this regard direct to him			0
i do n't know anything about it			0
" " i think the issue of the trips alone are probably not enough to suggest that he does n't have the right to assume the chairmanship of the @entity26 , " @entity65 said			0
" i think if all the allegations together prove to be true , that would certainly suggest questions about sen. @entity22 's fitness for the chairmanship and perhaps even his position in the @entity26			1
" the executive director for @entity61 , which sent the @entity78 e-mails to the @entity114 , said people should " withhold judgment given the many questions about the source of these allegations and the timing of these allegations			1
i think the best thing is to wait for the @entity114 to investigate and figure out what really happened here , if sen. @entity22 did something wrong and if not , who 's really behind this effort to smear him			1
" if this story evolves into a scandal and @entity22 is forced to resign , the @entity54 ' majority in the @entity26 would likely get one vote thinner			2
@entity23 law allows gov. @entity243 , a @entity189 , to appoint an interim senator until a special election , which would be no sooner than november			0
@entity0 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
