@entity0 arrived in @entity1 this summer filled with excitement and eagerness to learn			1
everyone who knows him says he is wise beyond his 17 years , that he is destined to lead others in his restive homeland of @entity8			1
he set foot on @entity1 soil for the first time in june , part of a group of young @entity8 chosen for a @entity15 - sponsored leadership program			1
but the hopes in his heart vanished as fast as they had blossomed			0
he was forced to watch from afar as militants from @entity19 , which calls itself the @entity20 , pressed into northern @entity8 , steamrolling @entity21 , the nation 's second largest city , and then chunks of @entity25 province			1
@entity0 's family feared for their lives in @entity29 , a @entity30 village on the arid plains of @entity25 that 's about 30 miles from @entity21			1
they had lived there all their lives in a modest home built by @entity0 's grandfather			1
@entity0 's father worked as a veterinarian once and owned a small farm with a garden and grazing cows and sheep			1
as a child , @entity0 played with his five brothers and sisters and his cousins in the garden			2
they rode tricycles along a paved driveway and cooled off in @entity8 's blistering blaze by soaking in a small , portable pool			2
on special holidays , they walked up a mountain that rose to the sky above their village for a family picnic			0
occasionally , they visited @entity60 , the main holy site for @entity30			2
@entity0 remembers going twice to the temple , squeezed into a crevice between two mountains and just a short drive from @entity65			2
@entity0 , the oldest boy in the family , was a serious student			1
his father encouraged his education and had sent him to the @entity70 city of @entity71 to study at @entity72 for @entity73 and @entity74 , run by an @entity1			2
there , he began working with another @entity1 , @entity76 , whose charity delivers wheelchairs to @entity8 children with disabilities			1
everyone held high expectations that @entity0 would succeed			2
one day , the family would break from the cycle that kept them bound to an impoverished village			0
but now they were on the run			0
their community was facing extermination			0
and @entity0 , whose drive to help others had led him to @entity1 , watched from afar , unable to help even his own family			1
@entity19 fighters were turning their rage on anyone who refused to succumb to their radical @entity100 tenets , including @entity101 and @entity30 , religious minorities in @entity8			1
hundreds of thousands were displaced overnight , according to the regional government			0
@entity0 's family , like many others , fled north to the outskirts of @entity108 , a city in @entity8 's @entity109 on the border with @entity111			1
if @entity0 returned to @entity8 , he would have to fly into the airport in @entity71 , under the @entity70 regional government			1
but he would be cut off from his family because the highway to @entity108 goes through @entity21 and territory under @entity19 control			1
he feared that if @entity19 managed to enter @entity71 , the first thing it would shut down would be the airport			2
then , he would never be able to get out			0
if he could get permission to stay in @entity1 , he would be safe			2
he might even have a chance at a life he could never dream of in @entity8			2
but he would be separated from his family , perhaps for a very long time			2
the plight of his people bore down on @entity126 as he attended classes every day with 25 other @entity8 students			1
he was the only @entity30 in the group			2
the group traveled to various cities in @entity1 and spent a chunk of time in @entity132 , @entity133			2
@entity0 savored the lush greenery of the @entity135 and the wildly different taste of @entity138 food			2
but his mind raced across continents and an ocean to the starkly arid , undulating landscape of northern @entity8			2
life - and - death decisions @entity0 was only 13 when he left home in @entity29 to study in @entity71			1
he loved school but hated that his geography books contained no pictures or illustrations			0
he looked forward to enrolling at the @entity72 , opened in 2008 by @entity1 doctor and missionary @entity151			2
@entity152 remembers the first time he saw @entity154 -- slight and so shy that for months he left the room every time @entity152 entered			0
over time , he relaxed and picked up americanisms , though @entity152 said @entity0 remained true to his @entity30 roots : respectful , quick to help elders and hypervigilant about visitors of all religions and ethnic groups who came to the institute			1
eventually , @entity0 grew to help manage the institute and assisted @entity76 , the former civilian contractor in @entity8 who ran wheelchairs for kids and was nominated as a 2009 @entity167			1
@entity76 recalls @entity0 's determination to help his fellow villagers			2
he was smart and enterprising : a kid who thought more about teachers ' salaries than about video games			0
@entity0 found the work rewarding			2
the stigma attached to disabilities is so high in @entity8 that @entity0 grew up not knowing his neighbor had two children who needed wheelchairs			1
they had hidden their secret well			0
but times were getting tough for the @entity30 , long persecuted in @entity8 for their religious beliefs			1
@entity30 are one of the world 's oldest and smallest monotheistic religious minorities			2
their ancient religion predates @entity187 by thousands of years and has links to @entity189			0
they venerate @entity190 as a redeemed archangel , which is why @entity192 view them -- mistakenly -- as devil worshipers			0
@entity187 militant attacks on the @entity30 in @entity8 are based on this centuries - old loathing			1
even before @entity19 arrived , @entity0 's family lived under constant fear that @entity100 militants in @entity21 would attack @entity30 , as they had been known to do in the past			1
one time , they stopped a school bus , yanked all the @entity30 children out and shot them dead			2
but " @entity30 " was not in @entity1 's vocabulary until in recent weeks when militant @entity187 's wrath threatened to wipe out an entire people in @entity8			1
@entity19 slaughtered more than 500 @entity30 , burying some of them alive			1
they captured women as slaves , ordered conversions to @entity187 and laid siege to @entity210 , trapping 50,000 @entity30 people atop without food and water			1
@entity0 's father , @entity214 , decided it was not safe for the family to remain in @entity29 , so they fled to @entity108			1
@entity0 's sister sent him photographs on her cell phone from the @entity111 border			2
@entity0 told me it was hard to look at those images			2
he knew his loved ones , displaced from their home , were huddled together in a small room , struggling to survive			0
he also knew his father was not telling him everything			0
i called his father to learn more about their situation			0
" please say hello to @entity0 , " @entity214 told me , the fatigue apparent in his voice			0
" do n't tell him about our condition			0
i do n't want him to worry			0
" he also said he does n't want @entity0 to return to @entity8			1
" we , yazidis , are treated like third - class citizens , " @entity0 said			0
" everywhere is filled with refugees			0
@entity19 -- they hate non-muslims who are not radicals			0
we and the @entity101 are vulnerable now to eradication			0
" @entity0 , he said , should make a new life in @entity1 and hold onto one belief : one day the family will be reunited			1
his father worries because no one in the family has a passport			0
getting one would have meant a trip to @entity21 , and for the last decade he has feared entering the @entity100 - dominated city that has been a hotbed of insurgent activity since the ouster of @entity254 in 2003			0
without passports , the @entity0 family can not cross the @entity111 border			1
once a proud farmer and veterinarian , @entity214 feels like a caged bird			0
life centers every day now on one thing : staying alive			0
then @entity0 ' voice strengthened			0
" thank you , " he said , " to good people everywhere			0
i wish only for peace in the world			0
" in @entity1 , @entity0 worried about what would happen if @entity19 pushed northward			1
how would his loved ones escape ? he feared they would be trapped and slaughtered like animals			0
" my family -- they are scared , " he said			0
" they do n't know what 's going to happen			0
" he knew he was facing decisions that no one his age should have to make			0
a chance at life free of fear last week , the visiting @entity8 students in the @entity15 's youth development program visited the @entity283 and met with vice president @entity284 even as president @entity285 was dealing with the myriad problems in @entity8			1
it was the last outing for the @entity8 students			0
the leadership program was nearing an end			1
@entity291 was running out for @entity292 knew he could potentially face death if he returned to @entity8			0
the young @entity8 boarded a plane to carry them back to their troubled land , their future prospects seemingly bleaker by the day			1
they took off with the horrific @entity19 killing of @entity1 journalist @entity298 in the headlines			1
they took off without @entity0			0
he stayed back with @entity300 , a @entity301 - based international business consultant who knows @entity76 and met @entity0 at @entity152 's school in @entity71			1
the three @entity1 had kept in touch with @entity0 during his stay in the @entity1 and stepped up to help him			1
@entity300 said @entity0 's father gave him permission to act as a guardian for @entity0 until he turns 18 next month			0
lord then filed a petition for @entity0 to obtain asylum in the @entity1			1
lord believes the current persecution of the @entity30 is more than enough reason to grant asylum			1
it ought to be an open and shut case , he said			0
" he 's a good kid , " @entity300 said			0
" @entity0 said he is ready to finish schooling here and launch his @entity1 dream , even though he has no way of knowing when he will see his parents and siblings again			1
amid a real threat of extermination of his people , @entity0 knows he is getting a chance to flourish			1
follow @entity167 's @entity329 on @entity330			0

@entity0 came to @entity1 as part of a @entity15 leadership program
back home in @entity8 , his family fled @entity19 persecution of the @entity30
separated from his family , @entity0 fears returning to his homeland
he watched the slaughter of his people from afar
