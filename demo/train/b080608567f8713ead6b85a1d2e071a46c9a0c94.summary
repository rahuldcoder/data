-- it took only hours after the identities of the two suspects in the @entity4 were revealed for some politicians and commentators to suggest that the tragedy was somehow the fault of a broken immigration system			1
ever since september 11 , there has been a strong and understandable desire for a perfect screening system for would - be immigrants			1
if only the @entity15 could put that system into place , bad people would never be admitted to the country			1
but such perfection is unachievable , and would not have prevented the @entity21 attacks			1
it would be a further tragedy to allow sensible overhaul of the @entity15 immigration system to be derailed by such misperceptions			1
here 's what we know so far			0
the two brothers suspected in the bombings , @entity32 , 19 , and @entity33 , 26 , were brought to the @entity15 by their parents in 2002 , likely from the former @entity35 of @entity36			1
that means one was a child and the other in his early teens when they moved to @entity21			1
the younger brother became a @entity15 citizen last year and the older brother held a green card			2
the family was originally from @entity46 , a region that has long resisted @entity49 rule , and where the mostly @entity51 @entity50 have been fighting for independence from the @entity49 government of @entity54 , and have carried out attacks again @entity49 civilians			0
could the two have been stopped by immigration controls ? the immigrant and visitor screening systems created by the @entity15 government after 9/11 are designed to identify people whose history gives cause for concern			1
consular officers and @entity67 officials check names against long terrorist watch lists and search for criminal records			0
those with suspicious travel histories -- to places such as @entity73 or @entity74 -- are subject to extra scrutiny			0
secure passports and the fingerprints taken from all new arrivals help prevent fraud			0
the database also includes records of fingerprints lifted by the @entity15 military and intelligence from battlefields and safe houses in @entity73 , @entity87 and other terrorist hot spots			2
all these systems make the @entity15 far more secure than it was a decade ago against those with terrorist or criminal histories			2
they do nothing , however , to protect us against the children of immigrants who might later become radicalized			2
like @entity101 after the 2005 @entity99 subway bombings , which were committed largely by young , second - generation immigrants , the @entity15 can no longer think this is only a foreign problem			1
radicalism can find fertile ground at home as well as overseas			0
does that mean the @entity21 attacks have nothing at all to do with immigration ? that would not be a reasonable conclusion either			1
a country that opens itself to immigrants , as the @entity15 has for many decades , invites in both the goods and ills of the world			1
@entity21 , for instance , is a city teeming with bright foreign students , many of whom will go on to make great contributions to the @entity15			1
indeed , one of the victims of monday 's bombing was @entity125 , a @entity127 math and statistics graduate student from @entity130 , @entity131 , who often told her friends how much she loved @entity21			2
but immigration also brings with it the disputes of other cultures			2
in 1985 , when i was living in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 -- a city that abounds with @entity142 immigrants -- an @entity144 flight from @entity145 to @entity146 was blown up over the @entity147 , killing 268 @entity140 , 27 @entity101 and 24 @entity148			0
the architects were @entity150 extremists who had emigrated from @entity148 to @entity140 and were fighting for causes of which few @entity140 had ever heard			0
the two - decade long investigation that followed was traumatic for @entity140 and for the many @entity148 immigrants with no ties to or cause with the radicals			0
but @entity140 moved on and remains a vibrant society that is largely welcoming of immigrants			0
it is not yet clear what motivated the @entity33 brothers to allegedly detonate a pressure cooker filled with explosives , nails and ball bearings at the finish line of one of the greatest foot races in the world			0
both could well have become caught up in the extremism that has roiled too much of the @entity173 world and caused others to carry out horrifying , senseless attacks against the innocent			0
or they may have had other dark reasons			0
but what is certain is that the @entity15 can not shield itself by closing its doors to immigrants , or even by coming up with still better screening tools			1
this country needs and deserves a far better immigration system , which is the goal of the immigration effort under way			1
but we should be realistic about what it can and can not do to protect us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

after @entity21 suspects @entity194 *'d* , politicians start blaming immigration system
@entity190 : perfect screening is *impossible* and would ***n't*** have prevented the bombings
the @entity15 ca ***n't*** shield itself with better screening or by keeping immigrants out
we need immigration *reform* , but must be realistic about what it can and ca ***n't*** do
