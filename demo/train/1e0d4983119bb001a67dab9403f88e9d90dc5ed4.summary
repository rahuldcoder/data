the @entity1 's @entity0 says it has identified three men involved in an alleged racist incident in @entity5 following @entity8 's @entity7 game against @entity9 tuesday			1
the match , which ended 1 - 1 , has been overshadowed by the release of a video showing what appears to be a group of @entity8 fans preventing a black man from entering a metro train whilst chanting " we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it "			1
the man in the video , which was widely shared on social media , was later identified as @entity26 , a 33 - year - old @entity5 on his way home from work			1
the @entity0 had issued an appeal to identify the three men pictured , but told @entity32 that help from the public was no longer needed			1
a spokesperson also denied reports that @entity1 police had spoken to the three men in connection with the incident but said they were " supporting the @entity41 investigation			1
" worldwide headlines the incident made headlines worldwide , drawing condemnation from @entity8 coach @entity46 , the club 's secretive @entity47 owner @entity46 and even @entity41 president @entity49			1
but the story took a further twist saturday as @entity52 appealed for witnesses to come forward with regard to a separate alleged incident of racist chanting at @entity59 's @entity58 train station on wednesday evening			1
@entity58 is the main terminal for @entity62 trains from @entity5			1
" the racist chanting was reported by a member of the public who was disgusted by the behavior of the men who had traveled on the 18.40 service from @entity71 , " superintendent @entity63 said in a statement			1
" the men shouted as they walked through the station having alighted from the train a short time earlier			1
" @entity75 also urged any eye witnesses to the incident to come forward			0
" if you traveled on the train from @entity5 or were at the station and have information which can assist our investigation i would urge you to get in touch as a matter of urgency , " the statement continued			1
@entity8 condemnation @entity8 moved quickly to condemn the first incident , calling the chanting " abhorrent " and something that " has no place in football or society " in a statement released wednesday			1
" i watched the image the next day , i did n't want to watch again , i watched only once , " @entity8 coach @entity46 said in a press conference friday			2
@entity46 also invited @entity26 to attend the return match against @entity9 in @entity59			2
" it is enough for me , it is sad enough for me			0
it is a humiliation for that gentleman , i imagine myself in that same situation , i want to go home after a day of work and a couple of guys they kick me out of my public transport , " @entity46 added			0
" and i can not go home			0
it is difficult to believe that this can happen in modern times but the reality is that it happens			0
" a club spokesperson also confirmed that owner @entity46 was " disgusted " by the incident whilst @entity41 president @entity49 personally spoke @entity26 " president @ fhollande spoke to @entity120 and offered his support over the odious racial attack he suffered , " the @entity117 announced via @entity118			1
" i did n't know i was filmed " the @entity41 on the receiving end of the abuse was initially unaware of the media storm as he lost his phone in the incident			1
he was later shown the footage by the @entity41 newspaper @entity129 for the first time , during an interview			2
" i did n't know i was filmed , " he said , before calling on the perpetrators to be arrested			0
" the fact that i 'm talking about it now gives me courage to go to the police and file a complaint			0
these people , these @entity138 fans should be found , punished and locked up			0
what happened should not go unpunished			0
" whilst no arrests have been made @entity8 confirmed friday that it had suspended five people from attending games at @entity144			2
@entity146 video when contacted by @entity2 about the latest allegations a @entity8 spokesperson said that the club would not be making an immediate statement before saturday 's @entity152 match against @entity153			1
shortly before the 3pm kick off -- 10am est -- @entity8 's official @entity118 account released a video of several senior players and coach @entity46 reciting a @entity146 quote			1
supporters also held several signs , placards and banners denouncing racism as the match got underway			0
but those efforts could well now be overshadowed by allegations of a second alleged racist incident			1
" it 's clear that unfortunately there is still a minority who think it is acceptable to behave in such an abhorrent manner , " superintendent @entity63 said			0
" the men shouted as they walked through the station having alighted from the train a short time			1
there is more that needs to be done to address the issue once and for all and @entity52 is actively working with football clubs , the football authorities and other key agencies to tackle this appalling behavior			2
" meanwhile , @entity26 confirmed that he will not be taking up @entity8 's invitation to attend the second match against @entity9 in @entity59			1
" i am touched by the invitation from mr @entity46 , " he told @entity187 @entity5 saturday			2
" but i 'm not in the right frame of mind to go to a stadium at the moment			0
" @entity8 draw , @entity194 lose there would be no respite from @entity8 's terrible week after they drew 1 - 1 with relegation threatened @entity153			2
the match began brightly for the home side			0
@entity201 , who scored in @entity5 on tuesday night , scored again after good work from @entity204 international @entity203			1
but the game turned on a controversial sending off			0
@entity8 's @entity207 international midfielder @entity206 was on the receiving end of a horror tackle from @entity153 's @entity210			2
@entity206 , who somehow avoided serious injury , reacted by pushing @entity210 to the floor giving the referee little choice but to show the red card			0
@entity153 pressed home their advantage and equalized late on through @entity216 as the match finished 1 - 1			0
@entity218 will hope to make the most of @entity8 's rare slip when they play @entity221 in the saturday evening kick off			2
@entity194 , meanwhile , threw away a one goal lead as @entity223 came from behind to win 2 - 1			0
@entity224 gave @entity194 the lead before goals from @entity227 and @entity228 turned the game on its head			0
@entity231 leapfrogged @entity194 into third after what appeared at first to be a routine win against fellow @entity59 rivals @entity236			2
a @entity238 penalty and @entity240 goal had given the north @entity59 club what seemed like an unassailable lead			0
but @entity231 were left hanging on when @entity236 scored in the 95th minute and almost grabbed a second			0
but @entity231 held on and the match ended 2 - 1 .			0
