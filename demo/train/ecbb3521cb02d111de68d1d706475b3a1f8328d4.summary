-- every day , we happily entrust more of our lives to automated machines at home and in our cities			0
but you could be forgiven for blanching at the prospect of a four - armed robot bearing over you , scalpel glinting			1
but fear not , a human , and a highly - trained one at that , is at the controls of the @entity16 robotic surgical system			1
" i think it 's very important to explain robotic surgery , " says @entity17 from @entity16 creators , @entity19			1
" the robot does n't do anything on its own			2
every movement , all of its controls are controlled by a surgeon who sits at a console			2
" the company 's tele - operated robots have performed more than 1.5 million operations from abdominal general surgery and gynaecology procedures to thoracic and lung operations			1
interactive : future of printing is @entity39 " the benefit is minimally invasive surgery			2
the patient will feel less pain , need less time to recover , generally ( lose ) less blood depending on the operation			0
there 's just a raft , a whole host of benefits to the patient , " @entity47 said			0
three components form the operating core of @entity16 : a patient cart -- which house the robotic arms , the surgeon console and a vision system that provides all the connections , which allow the console and instruments to communicate			1
every movement of the surgeon 's hand is relayed to the four arms that control up to 50 different instruments , from the basics like scissors and needle drivers to more advanced instrumentation that include electrocautery and staplers			1
" when you sit down at @entity16 console , it can do things that you can not do through other means , " @entity47 says			1
" the robotic mechanisms and the @entity39 vision that come along with it ( means ) you can manipulate tissue and perform surgery like no one else can			1
" read / watch : future of transport is self - driving cars @entity47 has been with the @entity90 - based company from its beginnings in the mid- 1990s and has seen the @entity16 system develop from concept to the 10,000 - component , $ 1 million - plus machine it is today			1
he still remembers the first time he saw it in action			0
there were ten engineers in the room			0
i remember a few people would joke about me in terms of my gloves being filled with sweat ... but we were all nervous in those days			0
we had a lot riding on the successful outcomes in terms of continuing to fund the company , " @entity47 said			2
but anxiety soon turned to optimism as the benefits to patients became clear			0
consultant surgeon and chief medical adviser to @entity19 , dr @entity118 has pioneered the use of the robot in hospitals			2
" i spent several months developing a robotic procedure for operating on morbidly obese patients and then we did it on our first patient , " @entity118 said			2
" things went extremely well , we were really , really pleased at what it allowed us to do that we could n't do with traditional methods			0
" that said , the system is not without its detractors			0
dr @entity133 -- a senior surgeon at the @entity134 in @entity135 -- is concerned that many people are not aware of its limitations			0
" the achilles heel of robotic surgery is that the robot can not feel the tissue , so the surgeon can make an inadvertent injury to a major structure , and that is a unique problem with this kind of surgery , " he said			1
" i 'm not anti-robot , but for most of the operations where robotic surgery is used , there 's no benefit to the patient			1
more technology does n't necessarily mean better quality healthcare			0
" however , since making their first sale in 1998 -- to @entity157 customers at the @entity158 -- the company has sold more than 2,500 robots to hospitals all over the world and reported revenues in excess of $ 2 billion last year			1
as for the future , @entity47 predicts that surgeons and their patients will be even further apart -- an idea that not so long ago would have seemed like a remote possibility			0
" i can imagine being a surgeon in @entity170 and working on a patient in another state , even @entity173 , " @entity47 says .			0

@entity16 robotic surgery has performed more than 1.5 million operations since late 1990s
surgeon operates robot remotely controlling up to 50 instruments on four robotic arms
@entity90 - based company had *turnover* of $ 2 billion in 2012 and lead the robot surgery field
