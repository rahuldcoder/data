@entity0 -- following the @entity4 @entity3 decision striking down a key portion of the landmark @entity6 , activists and those in states with a history of disenfranchisement at the polls are pinning their hopes on congressional action			1
but those hopes may be long deferred			0
a member of @entity19 who shed blood during the long march to civil rights told a @entity24 committee on wednesday that he believes the @entity6 " is needed now more than ever			1
" " the burden can not be on those citizens whose rights were , or will be , violated			0
it is the duty of @entity19 to restore the life and soul to the @entity6 , " said veteran congressman @entity28			1
" the day of the @entity3 decision broke my heart			2
it made me want to cry , " the @entity34 @entity33 told the @entity35			0
he spoke of facing beatings while marching across the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , for the right to vote and his pride in receiving a pen used by president @entity43 to sign the @entity6 into law			2
the testimony came during a week in which both attorney general @entity46 and former secretary of state @entity47 told @entity50 - @entity4 audiences that the right to vote must be safeguarded and urged congressional action in timely revision of the law			0
president @entity54 has expressed that he , too , is " deeply disappointed " in the ruling and wrote in a statement he was " calling on @entity19 to pass legislation to ensure every @entity4 has equal access to the polls			0
" skepticism @entity19 can address voting rights ruling but despite the heartfelt speeches , the reality is that there is little political incentive for many in @entity19 to act , political and legal experts say			1
" @entity72 @entity71 do n't really have any interest in changing what the @entity3 decided and many of the states the @entity72 @entity71 come from are taking advantage of this and moving forward with voting restrictions , " said @entity68 , a @entity69 historian and @entity1 contributor			1
last month , the high court effectively invalidated a key provision of the act that gives the federal government oversight of states and localities with a history of voter discrimination			1
the ruling said @entity19 must re-determine how places are put on the list using updated data — something chief justice @entity93 suggested @entity19 should have addressed when it reauthorized the law in 2006			2
" @entity19 could have updated the coverage formula at that time , but did not do so , " @entity93 wrote in the 5 - 4 majority opinion			2
" its failure leaves us today with no choice but to declare @entity100 unconstitutional			0
the formula in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance			0
" ' outrageous ' or overdue ? : court strikes down part of historic voting rights law shortly after the @entity3 ruling , several states with a history of voter discrimination that had previously been required to " pre-clear " any changes to their voting laws and district lines with federal authorities , pressed forward with controversial voter identification laws			1
@entity119 swiftly moved ahead with a hotly debated law requiring photo identification to vote and the state 's attorney general also expressed confidence that new redistricting maps passed by the @entity71 - controlled legislature would soon be implemented			1
the @entity127 had blocked the state 's redistricting efforts , citing them as potentially racially discriminatory			0
the ripple effects are being felt elsewhere as many of the 15 states — most of them in the @entity132 — that had required federal preclearance before changing voting practices began enacting new laws			1
in @entity138 and @entity39 , that has meant proceeding with plans to require voters to present a photo id before casting a ballot during the 2014 midterm elections			0
@entity145 elections officials have said they are eagerly eyeing putting in place similar laws just in time for the 2016 presidential election			0
@entity149 can set early voting times and days as it sees fit , a practice which drew criticism from some voting rights advocacy groups during the last general election amid accusations that the @entity71 governor and legislature were trying to disenfranchise minority voters in the swing state			2
and in @entity34 , @entity71 - redrawn district lines that irk @entity162 could be set			1
further , @entity28 and @entity164 rep. @entity163 , his @entity71 ally in the fight to recraft the @entity6 , will go before a @entity167 subcommittee on thursday chaired by rep. @entity168 , @entity169 , one of the 33 republicans who voted against the law 's 2006 reauthorization			1
to be sure , " there are other provisions of the law that can protect voters , " said @entity173 , deputy director at @entity175 's @entity174			0
there are still legal avenues to address discriminatory voting practices should they arise , she said			0
advocates for a congressional solution say lawmakers could pass a new formula for determining which places need extra oversight of their voting laws			1
and political experts point out that should a trend of disenfranchisement occur during the next several election cycles , it could provide congressional motivation to revisit the law in a substantive way			2
@entity198 unsure if @entity19 will take up @entity6 but @entity199 chairman @entity198 , @entity200 , recently said that he does n't know whether @entity19 will work to change the law so that it 's considered constitutional by the justices			1
" we will look at what the @entity3 was talking about in terms of old data , " @entity198 said on @entity1 's " @entity203			2
" " we 'll look at what new data is available and we will make sure that people 's freedom to vote in elections in this country is protected			0
" @entity1 's @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 struck down a key part of @entity6 ; left it to @entity19 to address *gap*
there 's little political incentive for a @entity71 - controlled @entity72 to change law
many @entity132 states moving forward with voting laws some see as onerous for minorities
experts say it may take a trend in discrimination in major elections to urge @entity19 to act
