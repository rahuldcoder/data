@entity0 -- an @entity3 politician accused in @entity5 diplomatic cables of sending a private jet to fetch a pair of sandals denied the allegations on tuesday and said @entity11 founder @entity10 had gone " mad			1
" " i would request the government of his country to send him ( @entity10 ) to a mental asylum and if they have no space for him in his country we can put him in our mental hospital , " chief minister of @entity13 , who goes by one name , said at a rare news conference			1
@entity27 's blistering response comes a day after a @entity5 cable released on @entity11 alleged she was a " paranoid dictator " and that " when she needed new sandals , her private jet flew empty to @entity31 to retrieve her preferred brand			1
" " i have no information on when the plane was sent to @entity31 for bringing sandals as has been stated by a @entity37 ( opposition party ) leader , and it looks like he and the @entity11 owner had gone in the same plane , " @entity27 said			1
the @entity42 ( formerly " untouchable " ) leader is an icon for millions of low - caste @entity3 who were oppressed by upper caste @entity47 for centuries			1
as the @entity5 diplomatic cable explained , " dalits will remain with @entity27 regardless of poor governance , simply because the fact that one of their own is chief minister provides them heretofore unimaginable pride			1
" a member of the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , @entity27 became the first dalit woman chief minister in 2007 , winning elections in the country 's most populous state by a majority			1
the controversial leader has often been criticized for her extravagance in what is one of @entity3 's poorest states			1
she has erected numerous enormous statues of herself across her state of @entity71 , spending more than a $ 1 billion dollars as a symbol of @entity42 empowerment			0
she is often congratulated with garlands made out of 1000 rupee or $ 20 bank notes at her political rallies			0
and she 's known to have a penchant for designer handbags			0
but according to senior political journalist and co-author of @entity27 's autobiography @entity82 , the self - glorification works for her constituency			1
" that 's the irony			0
in many ways , you find victim communities tend to look at larger - than - life leaders			2
@entity42 are a particularly oppressed community , they were never even allowed to worship the same gods , so they never had their own icons			0
so she has very cleverly used this to her advantage			0
this is not just megalomania , it also plays well with her audience			0
and she is not just a whimsical autocrat , she is far too successful in politics to be dismissed as that			0
" on tuesday , @entity27 rejected the allegations that she was " obsessed with becoming prime minister " saying they were " baseless " and indicative of " anti-dalit mentality			1
" the scathing report titled " @entity110 " sent by @entity5 diplomats in @entity0 quoted a local journalist 's account of the " dalit queen " making a state minister do sit - ups as punishment for a minor error			2
in a paragraph titled " @entity121 , " the @entity5 cable reported @entity27 employs nine cooks ( two to cook , the others to watch over them ) and two food tasters			2
the @entity5 cables cite " local journalists " and @entity27 's aide @entity126 as sources			2
@entity126 , a @entity129 member who is also known as @entity27 's right hand man , is quoted in the cables of allegedly saying @entity27 has a " penchant for personal corruption " and a " strong authoritarian streak			2
" @entity126 denied ever meeting a @entity5 official in may 2007 ( the time mentioned in the cables ) and threatened to take legal action			0
he told reporters on tuesday , " there is definitely some conspiracy behind it because a 2007 event is being talked about ahead of the 2012 @entity71 elections			0
" @entity145 was also surprised by the cables			0
" we all know she is pretty eccentric and pretty dictatorial and she can splurge , but as far as these specific allegations are concerned , the sourcing seems to be suspect , " @entity145 said			0
according to @entity145 , @entity27 has always been a very controversial leader , and for the urban middle classes who " dislike her intensely , " the @entity11 reports just confirm what they already think			2
as for whether these cables will affect @entity27 's political pull , @entity145 said : " she has n't done that much for the @entity42 , but when your leader is attacked by a class and caste which has been seen as the oppressor , then you automatically cling to your leader even more strongly , so all of this may actually be doing @entity27 a favor			1

@entity27 denies allegations , says @entity10 is " mad "
she is a hero to millions of low - caste @entity3
biographer says allegations may help make her more popular
