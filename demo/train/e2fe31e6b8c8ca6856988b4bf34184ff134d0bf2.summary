@entity0 never has a single haircut caused such a fuss			1
some call it the " @entity9 ; " others the " old man " cut			2
in either case , it 's supposed to be the cure for a misbehaving boy			2
a little bit of shame to get him back on track			2
" so you wana act grown ... well now you can look grown too , " @entity18 posted on the @entity20 page for his @entity22 barbershop in @entity23 , @entity24 , near @entity0			1
the mother of a 10 - year - old took @entity18 up on his offer			1
the ' after ' photos show a boy who looks like a little old man with a pronounced bald spot			2
@entity18 's post has gone viral on @entity20 and @entity35 , generating worldwide media coverage -- both cheers and jeers			1
" if my kid 's grades fell , i 'd do this to him , too , " said a @entity20 post by @entity40			1
but @entity44 was not amused			0
" i 'd rather punish a child at home and keep it a private matter than let someone else humiliate that child publicly , " he said			0
@entity18 said he 's not surprised by all the attention the new coif is getting			1
" because a lot of people are at a loss of how to discipline kids , you ca n't whup ' em anymore , like we used to , as children , " the barber said			1
" the inspiration came from @entity18 's own life , when he was having trouble last year with his 12 - year - old son , @entity1 affiliate @entity63 reports			1
the frustrated dad told him to quit acting up in school " like an old foolish man			0
" @entity18 shaved his son 's head bald and then showed him a picture of an old bald man , like the character in " @entity76			0
" " i showed him and i told him , this is your next one if you keep it up , " @entity18 told him			0
" he did n't want it , so he got his act together			0
" not familiar with the plot of " @entity9 ? " @entity85 begins life as an old man and ages in reverse			0
@entity22 offers the " @entity9 " for free , but usually it does n't come to that			2
one look at the picture of the first recipient of the " old man " cut is enough to do the trick			0
as for the young man who got " the special , " he says he 's learned his lesson , according to @entity18 , and has a nice new cut to go with his new attitude .			0
