-- an @entity2 judge warned gov. @entity4 's family against trying to get her then - brother - in - law fired , according to court records			1
investigators want to know if @entity4 tried to use her position improperly to get her former brother - in - law fired			1
that warning came long before the controversy over her dismissal of the brother - in - law 's boss , the state 's public safety commissioner , records show			1
@entity4 , the @entity19 nominee for vice president , is battling allegations she and her advisers pressured public safety commissioner @entity23 to fire her sister 's husband , state trooper @entity24			1
@entity4 's sister , @entity27 , and @entity28 were in the process of getting a divorce when the judge hearing the couple 's case said @entity27 's family appeared to be putting @entity28 's job at risk at a time when he would be required to pay child support			1
" it appears for the world that ms. @entity27 and her family have decided to take after the guy 's livelihood , that whatever who did what to whom has overridden good judgment , " @entity45 judge @entity44 said during an october 2005 hearing			1
" @entity51 told us not to slay the goose that lays the golden egg			2
for whatever reason , people are trying to slay the goose here , and it tends to diminish his earning capacity			0
" at the time , @entity4 was a private citizen and would not become governor until 2006			1
in complaints filed with the state police , she and other relatives had accused @entity28 of threatening her family during the divorce			0
@entity44 was in the process of settling the couple 's property and child - support arrangements in the 2005 hearing			2
the judge said his decision might have been different had @entity28 's continued employment with the state police been more certain			2
" the plaintiff 's table has created a situation where that is a very fragile outcome , " he said			0
@entity28 's union representative testified that the trooper was the subject of a " constant stream " of complaints from his ex-wife 's family			0
" if things do n't change , @entity24 's career is in jeopardy , " the union rep said			0
" my advice to @entity24 was to find another job , " said @entity89 , now executive director of the @entity90			0
" i think he needs , career-wise , to look for work elsewhere			0
" @entity0 obtained audio recordings of the hearing from the court clerk 's office in @entity99 , @entity2			1
@entity100 , the attorney who represented @entity27 , declined comment on the case wednesday , and other representatives of the governor did not immediately return phone calls			0
@entity28 was suspended for five days in march 2006 , after state police commanders determined he had used a taser on his 10 - year - old stepson " in a training capacity , " drove his patrol car while drinking beer and illegally shot a moose using his wife 's hunting permit			2
in a february 2008 hearing over new custody issues , @entity28 briefly complained that " disparagement " by his ex-wife 's family was continuing			0
complaints about @entity28 from @entity4 and her family have been under scrutiny since gov. @entity4 's july firing of @entity23 , whose duties included management of the state police force			1
after his dismissal , @entity23 said he was fired because he refused to succumb to pressure from the governor 's office to fire @entity28 , and his allegations have led to an investigation by the state legislature			2
@entity4 has denied any wrongdoing , saying the commissioner was removed because of disagreements over budget issues			1
her attorneys have called @entity28 a " rogue trooper " and said no one in the governor 's family knew of his suspension until after @entity23 's dismissal			0
spokesmen for sen. @entity148 's presidential campaign have said the legislative probe has become a " political circus " since @entity148 tapped @entity4 as his running mate in august			1
@entity4 originally pledged to cooperate with the investigation and disclosed that members of her administration had contacted state police officials nearly two dozen times to discuss @entity28			2
but last week , she asked the state personnel board to conduct its own probe , and a string of witnesses has failed to show up at scheduled depositions with the investigator hired by the @entity134			0
last week , @entity89 's union filed its own complaint against @entity4 and top aides , accusing them of improperly attempting to use confidential information from @entity28 's personnel files against him			1
the @entity148 campaign says @entity28 agreed to release his files during the divorce proceedings , and the information was in the public domain .			0
