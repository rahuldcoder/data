@entity2 , as one @entity1 user wrote tuesday , has been fooled by the " mysterious @entity4 art of satire			1
" the merciless comedy website @entity7 has declared @entity10 leader @entity9 the " sexiest man alive for 2012			1
" and it appears @entity2 's @entity12 has taken the story seriously			1
" i love this one , " @entity7 editor @entity14 told @entity15			1
" it has a certain delightfulness to it			0
" the @entity2 story reprinted satirical comments describing @entity9 's " air of power that masks an unmistakable cute , cuddly side , " his " impeccable fashion sense , chic short hairstyle , and , " the story says , " that famous smile			1
" the story on @entity12 on tuesday illustrates the mutual backscratching that @entity2 and @entity10 exercise through their government - run media			1
the incident also shows foreign media outlets ' difficulty in navigating @entity7 's brand of satire			2
the @entity2 website had underscored its story by including its own 55 - page photo gallery to accompany the text , which was published in both @entity43 and @entity2			1
but the pages and the images were no longer available wednesday			0
a woman responding to a call wednesday to the office of the website said it was " impossible that the @entity12 will quote from any unreliable media -- we do verify our news and sources			2
" the woman , who declined to identify herself , noted that the item had been removed			0
the @entity12 has a separate office from the print version of the @entity58 's main newspaper			0
@entity14 said he 's not surprised when legitimate news sites fall for his high - level tomfoolery , but this was the first time @entity7 had named a " sexiest man alive			1
" " we knew it would get a response , " he said " but we did n't expect it would get life from abroad			0
" a satirical post on @entity7 congratulated the @entity12 for its coverage			1
the site " has served as one of the @entity7 's @entity72 bureaus for quite some time , and i believe their reportage as of late has been uncommonly fine , as well as politically astute , " said @entity7 's @entity75 in a e-mail statement			2
" may our felicitous business association continue for centuries to come			0
" earlier tuesday , the @entity7 pointed readers to the @entity2 website : " please visit our friends at the @entity12 in @entity2 , a proud @entity83 subsidiary of @entity86 @entity85 reportage , comrades			1
" read the @entity2 story @entity1 users went wild over the editorial faux pas			2
" it makes me cry from another room ! " tweeted @entity94 @ fraubass			0
" not sure they know this was a joke , " wrote @ loweringthebar			0
" @entity99 again , " said @entity98 @ colinfreeman99			0
if this scenario sounds familiar it 's because the @entity7 is no stranger to fooling government - run news outlets			2
in september , an @entity7 satire fooled @entity107 's semi-official @entity106			1
@entity106 published an @entity7 story claiming that a @entity110 poll found that rural white @entity111 preferred @entity107 president @entity112 over president @entity113			1
on the @entity2 microblog @entity115 , netizens made their own teasing comments about @entity12			1
" foolish foreigners , the party paper was born to be funny , " wrote @ @entity117			0
" the world was fooled by the @entity12 , because no @entity2 believes this paper , " wrote @ @entity120			2
the @entity7 never writes its stories with the intention of fooling government agencies , @entity14 said			0
but " it 's great when it happens			0
we hope it happens more often			0
" this prank , he said with obvious glee , may turn out to be the legendary @entity7 fake story that veterans will talk about for years to come			2
" we essentially just fooled the government of @entity2			0

@entity7 editor : *tricking* @entity2 has a " certain delightfulness "
a @entity2 news site takes an @entity7 satire for a real story
the @entity7 declares @entity10 leader @entity9 " sexiest man alive "
@entity12 runs portions of the @entity7 story and 55 photos of @entity9
