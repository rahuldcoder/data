@entity1 , @entity0 -- teachers in @entity1 , @entity0 , have voted to continue their strike , in defiance of a a court order to stop			1
@entity7 , the spokesman for the @entity1 teachers union , said teachers voted thursday to continue their strike despite a judge 's wednesday order			1
at a union meeting thursday afternoon , 1,478 teachers voted to keep striking , @entity7 said , adding that 107 voted " no " or abstained			2
he said teachers were concerned about how judge @entity17 would react to their defying his order			2
the @entity19 did not return a call seeking comment , but a message posted on the district 's website said school for 28,000 students would be suspended again friday , as it has been for the rest of the week			1
@entity17 's order on wednesday was in a case the district brought against the striking teachers and their union			2
after the ruling , district superintendent @entity33 said he expected teachers to return to work while the union and school district continued stalled contract negotiations			1
at the time of the ruling , a hearing was scheduled for friday to ensure the union complied with the judge 's order			0
@entity17 also ordered hearings on the legality of the strike and stalled negotiations			0
attorneys for the school district argued that since teachers are state employees they do not have the right to strike			1
" the illegal strike has forced the district to close 57 schools , disrupting the lives of approximately 30,000 students and their families , " school district attorney @entity53 wrote in the lawsuit			1
@entity53 argued that if the strike continued indefinitely the protest would harm students , particularly children with disabilities , low - income pupils who rely on meals provided at schools and seniors applying to college next year			0
" students in @entity1 , under the @entity70 , are entitled to an education , " she said			0
some 1,900 teachers went on strike this week after talks broke down over a new contract for educators			2
the teachers union argued the school district was unyielding on the issues of class size , teacher pay and how teachers are transferred between schools			1
@entity85 , the attorney for the teachers union , said the school district was not negotiating in good faith and that if the strike continued , students could make up the missed time later			1
" what they are saying is that the school year is immovable , ca n't be changed under any circumstances			0
that is not correct , " @entity85 said			0
" whether my child misses a week or two , it 's not going to affect her education , " @entity85 said of his daughter , who he said attends classes at a @entity1 public school			2
" this is about teaching our kids to stand up to bullies , " said @entity101 , president of the teachers union			0
" i 'm disappointed that we 're not bargaining , that we 're spending the day in court			0
" the state judge said the school district 's arguments that students were being harmed by the strike were enough reason to halt the protests , at least until more hearings and negotiations could be held			1
calling himself " a product of the @entity19 , " @entity17 said if anyone did n't like his ruling , they could blame it on his education			0
during wednesday 's court session , @entity17 held up photographs of a sign he said had been placed at his home			0
the printed sign said " @entity1 teachers			1
