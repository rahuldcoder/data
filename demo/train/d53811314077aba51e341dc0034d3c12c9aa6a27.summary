@entity0 -- a @entity3 measure to temporarily reverse the doubling of interest rates on millions of government - backed student loans fell short in the @entity8 on wednesday , but there was hope a bipartisan deal would be struck soon to remedy the situation			1
" we 're trying to find some common ground , " said sen. @entity12 of @entity13 , the no. 2 @entity3 leader who spearheaded fresh talks on the dispute			0
" we do n't have an agreement and i ca n't say when or if we 'll come together			0
" sen. @entity19 of @entity20 , a @entity21 member of the group seeking a deal , believes there are some options that " seem to pique a lot of interest in a bipartisan way			2
" @entity29 needed the support of 60 senators in a test vote on a proposal backed by the @entity34 to temporarily return rates for subsidized , need - based @entity37 loans to 3.4 % to give lawmakers more time to work out a long - term fix for a number of higher education affordability issues			1
it never had much of a chance because all 46 republicans opposed it as did some @entity29 and was easily defeated			1
interest rates on the subsidized financing for low - income students doubled on july 1 because of congressional inaction to hold them steady heading into the next school year			1
far more students take out unsubsidized student loans from the government -- those rates have been at 6.8 % since 2007			1
student loan debt has skyrocketed in recent years , as have delinquencies , making it a pressing political and financial issue for millions of @entity60			1
many young graduates are deep in debt and without jobs			2
student loan debt is second only to mortgages as the largest debt that consumers carry			1
for the class of 2013 , much of the debt is in government loans with graduates owing an average of $ 26,000 , according to a @entity73 survey of 750 college graduates			1
the new rates apply for loans beginning after july 1			2
opponents of the @entity8 @entity3 remedy said it would have just deferred hard decisions and kept rates low for a short time			2
they prefer a permanent change to how interest rates are calculated for the millions of undergraduates , graduate students , and parents who take out government loans each year			1
bipartisan talks were triggered after top @entity34 officials , including chief of staff @entity91 and education secretary @entity92 , met with senate majority leader @entity93 and other @entity3 leaders tuesday night			0
negotiations are aimed at sifting through the various proposals for interest rates , surcharges , and whether to mandate a cap on how high rates could rise , a key demand from @entity29			1
" these things move in tandem , " explained @entity12			0
" as you lower the cap you raise the rates			0
as you raise the cap you lower the rates			0
so we 're trying to find the right spot that works for everyone and we 're still working on it			0
" sen. @entity111 , another member of the bipartisan group , said @entity113 appeared ready to compromise by accepting a rate cap			0
" there is a good spirit and i think the interest is in finding a way to yes , " the @entity116 @entity115 said			0
@entity113 , who prefer that markets set rates , pushed through a measure in may that ties rates to the bond market and caps them at 8.5 %			2
this summer 's fight is similar to the one that took place last year when @entity131 acted to avert an increase in the middle of a presidential campaign .			0
