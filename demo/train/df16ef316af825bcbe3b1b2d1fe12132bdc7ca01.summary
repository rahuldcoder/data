-- durable , shock resistant and , most of all , growing in a ready - to - use tubular form , it 's a wonder bamboo has n't always been used to make bicycle frames			1
while the prototype for a bamboo - framed bicycle was first developed as early as 1894 -- causing a minor sensation when it was unveiled at a @entity12 technology show at the time -- the idea never took off			1
now 120 years later and a small but determined outfit in @entity15 is working hard to change all that			1
" we ca n't keep ( up ) demand with the orders for our customized bicycles , " explains @entity17 , the executive director of @entity18			0
" we are hoping to go into mass production by june this year			0
" while mass production for a company that currently employs about 30 people means turning out just 60 to 100 of the beautiful handmade bicycles a month , @entity17 is confident of scaling up the operation			2
here the advent of a minimal amount of technology has made all the difference			0
" we still do it by hand , but now we 've got a construction jig and this makes manufacture that much faster , " she told @entity0 from the small factory outside the capital @entity36			1
using a method developed by @entity42 engineer @entity41 -- a renowned bicycle designer who first experimented with bamboo bicycles in 1995 -- the frames are lashed together with fiber and then coated with epoxy			1
sturdy , and with a greater weight - to - strength ratio than steel , the bikes are robust , make for a smooth ride and are gaining a small but devoted following in @entity53			2
growing international attention " we are getting a lot of interest from the @entity58 where people are using them for touring , " she said			0
" and they 're popular with shops and exhibitors because people like the look of them			0
" their first prototype came out of the factory more than four years ago and is still in operation			2
@entity17 said the bikes are remarkably durable and there 's every indication that the first model will continue for many years to come			2
with just two sticks of bamboo enough to make one bicycle , and six regions in @entity15 where bamboo grows abundantly , the @entity74 is unlikely to run out of raw materials			1
last november the bicycle was the darling of the @entity83 ( @entity84 19 ) where @entity86 secretary general @entity85 donned a crash helmet to take a shaky turn around the conference center on one of the @entity15 bikes			1
@entity92 , the head of the @entity86 's @entity93 ( @entity93 ) , also entrusted herself to the bicycle 's rigid pannier rack to hitch a ride around the center			1
" they 're made by women and these women are teaching other women to make these bamboo bikes and to sell them so that they have another income stream , " @entity92 said			1
building opportunities as a vehicle for women 's emancipation , the bicycle in history has been unrivalled			1
during the bicycle craze in the @entity42 and @entity53 of the late 19th century , it came to symbolize the new woman , not only giving them unprecedented mobility but launching reform movements such as the @entity115 which advocated for a woman 's right to dress appropriately for cycling			2
for @entity17 -- who co-founded the company with school friends @entity121 and @entity122 -- the @entity18 proudly carries on that tradition			0
" currently we have about 20 to 25 women trained who are working in the factory but as we expand we hope to bring more on board , " she said , adding that the initiative was launched as a way of using local renewable materials and satisfied local needs and created employment opportunities			1
" not only that but it looks cool and attractive , " she said			0
one customized model even comes emblazoned with @entity137 motifs rendered in distinctive @entity15 folk - art style			2
she said the prize the initiative won last year in @entity141 , the @entity142 , was bringing with it more attention , more orders and greater ambitions for the company			0
" currently we do n't manufacture many of the metal parts -- the chain and the forks we have to import but some of the metal parts for the frame are manufactured here			0
" but we are hoping that if we find a collaborator in the medium to long - term , the tires , the wheels , the chain , and everything else could be made here in our factory			0
" @entity0 's @entity162 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0
