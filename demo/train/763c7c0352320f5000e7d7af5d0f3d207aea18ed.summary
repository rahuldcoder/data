-- @entity1 produced some of his best golf to give himself a massive lead heading into final round of the @entity6 as broke the @entity8 course record			1
@entity1 carded a course - record 62 in the third round of the @entity6 at @entity8 , @entity11			1
the world number one had been tied at the top of the leaderboard with fellow - @entity16 @entity15 after the second round , but pulled clear of the field after he carded a course - record third round 62			1
woods had a 16 - under total of 197 , seven shots ahead of @entity16 @entity23 , who carded a 66 , and @entity25 @entity24 , who posted a 68			1
@entity27 's @entity26 hit a 69 for 205 and is next in line with @entity16 @entity29 , who shot a round of 66			1
the @entity11 course has proved a popular hunting ground for @entity1 who is a four - time winner of the event and his impressive nine - under round included a superb eagle at the ninth			1
@entity20 ' round broke the previous record of 62 at the course , while he also equaled the tournament record which had been set by @entity43 at @entity44 in september 2008 , and he admitted something just clicks when he plays the @entity8 course			1
" i played here even as an amateur in the old @entity50 - i 've always felt comfortable playing this golf course - i 've always liked it , " @entity1 told the @entity48 web site			1
" even though the golf course has changed this year for us , the routing is still the same , and i 've always felt comfortable playing this golf course for some reason , and even though , for instance , they changed @entity60 , i still feel comfortable on the property			2
and this is very similar to that			2
" the round just kind of built upon itself			2
i bogeyed one right out of the gate and birdied three to get back			2
it just kind of built it over itself			2
i made a nice save there at five after hitting a really good drive , landed in the fairway and kind of ran into an impossible spot			0
" birdieing six and then good save at seven , it kind of just built			0
and then going birdie - eagle to finish off the front nine , you 're always can make up shot from eight to 11 , and i did today			1
" the only hole i did n't take care of was 10			0
i wanted to hit wedge in there so bad , but coming out of the first cut , i wanted to take over the green out of play , and i came up a little bit short			1
" @entity1 added : " i did drive well today			1
i 've driven it good all week			0
actually the last few weeks i 've felt like i 've driven the ball much better			0
" you know , when i 'm able to get it down there , obviously with my length , i can get in there with some shorter clubs			0
this golf course has allowed me to kind of get down there a little bit			0
" when we were playing at @entity101 , it was kind of hard to get the ball down there			0
it just did n't fit			0
some of the tees were up and some of the angles just did n't quite fit			0
but this golf course , it fits			0
" the $ 7.5 million tournament is the third event in the @entity16 @entity48 's @entity112 playoff series and a victory for @entity20 would put him back at the top of the standings after he relinquished the place to @entity118 last week .			0
