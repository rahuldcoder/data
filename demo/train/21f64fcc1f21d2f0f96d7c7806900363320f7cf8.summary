you may know where you are and where you 're going to , but do you know why you know that ? the @entity4 has honored three neuroscientists , whose work is helping answer that question			0
@entity8 , along with @entity9 and @entity10 , discovered cells that form a positioning system in the brain -- our hard - wired gps			1
those cells mark our position , navigate where we 're going and help us remember it all , so that we can repeat our trips , the @entity16 said in a statement			2
@entity23 : medical award kicks off week of announcements @entity27 's insights their research could also prove useful in @entity27 's research , because of the parts of the brain those cells lie in -- the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex			1
humans and other mammals have two hippocampi , which lie in the inner core of the bottom of the brain and are responsible for memory and orientation			2
the entorhinal cortices share these functions and connect the hippocampi with the huge neocortex , the bulk of our gray matter			0
in @entity27 's patients , those two brain components break down early on , causing sufferers to get lost more easily			1
understanding how the brain 's gps works may help scientists in the future understand how this disorientation occurs			1
the research is also important , because it pinpoints " a cellular basis for higher cognitive function , " the @entity16 said			0
the scientists conducted their research on rats , but other research on humans indicates that we have these same cells			1
nerve cell discoveries @entity8 , a @entity71 neuroscientist who is also an @entity72 - born @entity72 citizen , made the first discovery in 1971 , when he came upon a nerve cell in the brain of a rat that was set off whenever the rat was in a particular place , the statement said			2
the scientist called them " place cells			1
" in 2005 , the @entity82 , @entity83 neuroscientists , discovered yet another component			0
" they identified another type of nerve cell , which they called ' grid cells , ' that generate a coordinate system and allow for precise positioning and pathfinding , " the statement read			1
they also later figured out how place and grid cells work together to make the brain know where it is and where it 's headed			1
oversimplified , one could say that the place cells mark point a and point b in the brain , and the grid cells help the brain get from point a to point @entity106 the prize money of 8 million @entity109 kronor ( $ 1.2 million ) took an interesting split			1
@entity111 went to @entity8 and half went jointly to the @entity82 , who are a couple			2
it would seem to reflect the half - half nature of their discoveries			0
@entity16 background monday 's ceremony at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity109 , will be followed by the announcement of the physics prize tuesday , the chemistry prize wednesday and the economics prize on october 13			2
the prize for literature will be awarded on a date to be announced later			0
the @entity129 will be awarded friday			0
two @entity72 and a @entity130 shared the @entity4 in physiology last year			0
@entity132 and @entity133 , and @entity130 @entity134 were awarded the prize for discoveries of how the body 's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce			1
@entity109 industrialist @entity142 created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics , chemistry , literature and peace			0
the first economics prize was awarded in 1969 .			0

prize money took an interesting split : half went to a scientist , half to other 2 jointly
their research could be useful in the study of @entity27 's *disease*
place cells and grid cells make the brain know where it is and where it 's going
research by the three also helps better understand how *people* orient themselves
