@entity0 , @entity1 cultivated a devoted audience that loved bad b - grade movies and inspired heckling			1
" @entity14 " showed series creator @entity10 as a man stranded in space with some wisecracking robots			1
as original cast members left the show and new comedians were introduced , the show continued to deliver a unique brand of humor			1
years later , " @entity14 " has given rise to @entity22 , comprised of @entity10 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
@entity22 met with @entity2 to discuss their process and something called " @entity29 's			1
" @entity2 : what 's it like being back with some of the old " @entity14 " gang ? @entity10 : it 's been great			2
we 're kind of like different gangs all intersected because our times at " @entity14 " did n't all overlap			2
but we all knew each other before " @entity14 " even started , because we were all comics			2
so it 's been great			2
it 's been fun to hang out with these guys after so many years			2
we hang out a lot now because we 're on the road together quite a bit			1
@entity26 : it feels safe			2
] @entity23 : this is like our third year doing this , so we 've had a lot of experience			2
we 've done 60 shows on the road these last three years , and each time we go to a new location , so we 're spending a lot of time with each other now			1
or , just enough time			2
@entity25 : and we all share one room , so that 's ... [ @entity25 rolls her eyes			2
] @entity2 : can you explain the process of finding the movies that you 're going to give the @entity22 treatment to ? @entity10 : i do it now			1
@entity26 did it for " @entity14 , " so he can give you his take on it for that			2
for @entity22 we use certain vendors who search for movies , so occasionally they 'll bring stuff to me			1
or i 'll just look for stuff			2
half of our stuff is licensed , so they 're representing different producers , and half of it is public domain , so that 's a whole different process			2
you find a movie , and you have to find the right print and you have to do a copyright search , talk to the lawyer , make sure it 's ok to use			1
then , once we have those that fit that profile , then i show it to everybody and we go through the process of everyone signing off on it , saying if this will work			1
we just did that with a new movie we 're working on right now			1
it 's called " @entity93			1
" [ @entity22 grins and snickers			1
] @entity25 : people get ravaged			1
is that a bad way to use that word ? @entity24 : they do n't get ravaged in a good way , they get ravaged in a bad way			1
@entity26 : for " @entity14 " it was a little different , in that we would be sent a bunch of screeners			2
when we were working with @entity4 they would find screeners and send them to us , and i would just do the initial process of going through the boxes and watching them , find the ones i thought could work as a show , and then show them to everybody else			2
but back then we had the machinery of a cable network to help us with that kind of stuff , but now we 're on our own			2
@entity2 : how is @entity22 distributed ? what 's working , what 's not and what are your future plans ? @entity23 : we 're self - financed and self - distributing			1
trace and his wife do fulfillment stuff			2
we also offer the show through download at a site called easytakes.com			2
and it seems like it 's about half and half			0
@entity24 : yeah , it runs , hard disks maybe twice as much as downloads			0
@entity10 : plus easytakes is packaging our movies as apps for the @entity143 so you can buy the app and it will just play the movie			1
@entity23 : the @entity143 thing has yet to launch			0
@entity24 : we sell a good number of @entity149 here [ at @entity151 ] and at our live shows , too			1
it 's a real manufacturing to customer direct line			0
@entity26 : we leave out the middle man and pass the savings on to you ! @entity10 : he 's waited his whole life to say that			0
@entity2 : do you find that audiences at @entity151 are especially tuned in to your brand of humor ? what is the con circuit like for you ? @entity10 : well we do n't really do the circuit , we sort of just go to the occasional con			1
@entity24 : this is the one we 've been to the most			0
this is our third year			0
this one fits our sensibility more because our @entity172 has always been do - it - yourself , and this one is all that			1
it 's really people - powered			1
comic - con is really just @entity179 blowing you away with how much money it has and awing you with its giant displays and you really are , as a fan or an observer , you 're really put in this category			1
here it really just , like , flows everywhere			0
you just can see people being creative and kind of doing their own thing			1
i think this one fits much better , i prefer this con way more than @entity178			0
@entity23 : we did the @entity22 panel last night to a packed ballroom and then we showed our episode and then came back afterwards and did some signing afterwards			1
but 90 percent of that audience stayed to watch the episode			0
@entity24 : yeah and they were a great audience for that episode			0
@entity23 : yes , they were totally tuned in and it was exciting to see			0
@entity2 : @entity204 , how did you decide on the moniker @entity206 ? @entity23 : i decided on it because when i joined the writer 's guild there already was a @entity212 , and i gave myself the @entity206 because i loved that it gave me the initials @entity23 and also somewhat inspired by being a fan of @entity216 , but mostly it 's about @entity218 @entity10 : in @entity220 there are very few people not named @entity212			1
@entity2 : can you describe the transition from " @entity14 " to what you 're doing with @entity22 and what your old coworkers are doing with @entity227 ? @entity10 : well , when we started we were really interested in doing very quirky movies , and [ @entity227 ] were doing big movies			1
they did " @entity232 , " and any big blockbuster that came out			0
it seemed really clear that we 're working this side of the street with old movies and they 're working new movies			0
but that 's getting kind of muddled now because they 're coming back and doing old movies			1
like we did in " @entity14			0
" @entity2 : what 's the secret to making wisecracks for a living ? @entity26 : that 's a long process			0
we all started out as stand - up comics , so we all set out for careers being weisenheimers , making wisecracks			1
@entity24 : you have @entity254 , do n't you ? [ everyone laughs			0
] @entity26 : i do , actually , it 's painful			0
@entity10 : i 'm grappling with @entity29 's disease			0
@entity25 : we 're having a walk for you			0
@entity23 : but we were lucky enough , when we started " @entity14 " to have a @entity262 station that sort of gave us free reign			0
so we had a little laboratory to create this art form , if you will			0
@entity10 : back then we did 20 shows , and we just improvised			0
it was unheard of back then to make a show where you just kind of talk over a movie			1
prior to that there had been people who re-synched , added sound , redone the dialogue on movies , but this was really different so it grew very organically			1
by the end of it we kind of had it figured out			0
if we did n't have that , i ca n't imagine just walking in and trying to pitch this idea to anybody			0
@entity26 : and we had 20 shows that we could edit down to a four - minute sizzle reel that we could show them			1
@entity10 : we had a thousand people in a fan club , so we had this kind of packet that we could lay down when we went to the @entity5			1
and we said , " hey , this is happening , " and they just happened to need content			0
so it was just ' cause it was the beginning of basic cable and they needed to fill time more than anything			0
@entity26 : sad but true			0
@entity10 : it worked for us			0
@entity2 : what 's the difference between a geek and a nerd ? @entity23 : geeks will talk to us , nerds find us too weird			0
@entity10 : to me , for geeks there 's an extra level of involvement for whatever it is they 're focused on			0
a geek kind of implies a specificity of interest for whatever it is they 're geeking out about			0
@entity24 : @entity319 is more intense than nerd @entity26 : i think a nerd gets beat up , and a geek gets beat up and then goes and watches an episode of " @entity325			0
" @entity23 : yeah , and starts a software company .			0

@entity22 take their wisecracking brand of movie - heckling humor on the road
@entity151 is a good fit , because of the *individuality* *fostered* at the *convention*
