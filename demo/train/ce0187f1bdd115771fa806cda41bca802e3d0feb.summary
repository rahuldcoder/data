-- last season 's finale of " @entity3 " finally answered the lingering question of who exactly is the mother of the tv series ' title			1
the show 's main character , @entity8 , played by @entity10 and voiced in narration by @entity12 , has spent eight seasons telling his kids the story of how he met their mom , endlessly dragging out the eventual interaction			1
finally , creators @entity18 and @entity20 revealed the mother 's identity ; she is played by @entity23			1
the @entity25 show will enter its ninth and final season on september 23 , with an hourlong episode , giving one last chance to play out the stories of @entity8 and his friends before -- we hope -- seeing him happily settle down			1
the creators , episode director and producer @entity34 and cast members @entity10 , @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) and @entity42 ( @entity43 ) teased the upcoming 24 - episode season recently at the @entity44			1
during a panel on the show , the creators unveiled a clip that explains why @entity8 's children have been sitting on a couch listening to him tell this never - ending saga			1
it ties in with something to come later in the season involving the kids , which @entity18 said they shot during the second season for whenever the ending arrived			1
" we thought we 'd be done after eight seasons , " @entity58 told @entity0 after the panel , " so season nine is a bonus year and it 's the @entity60			1
we 're changing a lot of the rules about how we thought we 'd tell the story			0
" @entity20 added , " i do n't think the story has changed , but how we tell it has changed now that we have 24 extra episodes to see more of it			1
knowing what we have left to tell , this little story we 've been meaning to tell for eight years now , it would have felt really abrupt to end it after eight seasons			0
" " @entity3 " has traditionally used multi-episode narrative arcs and flashbacks to keep the story moving , often jumping in time or extending a season over the course of a year			1
the final season , however , will take place entirely over one weekend in the fictional town of @entity82			1
" there 's a mass migration to @entity82 , to the @entity85 , for @entity37 and @entity39 's wedding , " @entity10 told @entity0			1
" we last left our gang when @entity41 and @entity8 were driving out together , @entity37 and @entity39 were driving out together and @entity43 was planning to come back from @entity88 for the wedding			1
it 's a road trip			2
everyone has various problems along the way , because that 's what happens on television			2
we pick up literally where we left off			0
" last season left the door open for the resolution of several storylines			2
@entity39 , preparing for her wedding to @entity37 , enlisted @entity8 's help finding a locket she 'd buried in @entity106 and found herself in a romantic moment with him			1
@entity41 and @entity43 ( and their infant son ) were about to move to @entity110 for @entity41 's job when @entity43 was offered a judgeship in @entity113 but did n't know how to tell @entity41			2
" it seems like it 's something @entity43 wants to tell her in person , " @entity42 said			2
" which i think is smart			0
i do n't know how they 've planned time-wise for the season ; they could wrap it up in the finale for all we know			2
we find out the day before the table read			0
it 's neat for us to see things unfold			2
" @entity40 added , " i do n't like to know too much because i do n't want to have to lie			0
i 'm a terrible liar , so i really do n't know , but he obviously does n't want her to find out , and it 's going to be one of those ' is she going to find out ? ' stressors for @entity43			2
" the real draw for the last season is getting to watch the beginning of @entity8 's relationship with the mother unfold			1
@entity34 confirmed fans will see @entity8 meet the character very quickly into the ninth season and said viewers are " going to get to know her			1
" as the characters gather for the wedding , the on - again , off - again nature of @entity8 and @entity39 's relationship will also be addressed , something at which the season premiere 's title , " @entity152 , " may hint			1
as for the revelation of @entity23 in the role of the mother last season , the creators said keeping that secret was the hardest thing they 've done on the show			1
" we shot it on this other stage , " @entity18 said			0
" we built this big train station set you saw in the season finale			2
we did n't have any extras			0
everyone else you saw walking around there is the ' @entity3 ' writers ( and crew )			1
it was a family affair			0
no strangers or outsiders were a part of it			0
we made everybody ( who ) was there -- not that we do n't trust our cast and crew -- sign confidentiality agreements			2
we were terrified for a month and a half			0
every day we were terrified that it would get out , but it did n't and that was great			0
" the cast members seemed emotional about " @entity3 " coming to an end , but @entity36 said they are just trying to enjoy filming this season			1
" i compartmentalize things , and i 'm not a fan of goodbyes so i have n't really contemplated it , " @entity36 said			0
" i do n't want to spend the time we have on the show lamenting its demise because we 're not there yet			2
we 're still in the beginning of the show			2
so even though it 's run eight seasons , we still have 20 - some odd weeks to do it , and i want to make sure we 're enjoying it as opposed to being wistful about it			0
" @entity38 , who also appears in the season premiere of the new @entity206 show " agents of @entity208 , " said , " it has n't started to sink in yet			1
but we have six more episodes after the holidays , and i feel like that 's going to be a really intense time for everyone			1
" @entity38 also shared a piece of trivia about the series that surprised even her co-stars			0
" @entity39 was not a @entity218 when i signed on for the show , " @entity38 said			0
" she became one because , according to @entity18 and @entity20 , we 're exotic			0
literally the words they used to me in season one : ' well , i just feel like it 's really exotic			1
' i never in my life have been called exotic			0
" for @entity10 , " @entity3 " has meant being involved in something groundbreaking in terms of storytelling			1
the extended arcs and serialized narrative structure was not widespread when the show premiered , but it has since become part of the tv landscape			0
" we introduced some stuff that is now commonplace in some ways , " @entity10 said			0
" i was actually talking with @entity18 and @entity20 last night about how there 's this new fashion of dumping 12 episodes out			1
like @entity239 is now giving all these episodes , and they can do really serialized arcs			0
that 's what @entity18 and @entity20 excel at			0
that 's what they always wanted to do			0
follow the locket or follow these different threads			0
" i feel like in some ways we just did what we did really well , and the public mood caught up to us			0
when you 're at the top of the mountain and you look back , you say , ' wow , we got to do some incredibly strange , amazing moments of television			0
