i found out that the may sat test had been canceled across the whole of @entity3 just a couple of hours after teachers were told			1
a chance conversation with a friend , who is a teacher at an international school here , revealed the scramble to organize alternative tests in other countries for young students hoping to get into elite @entity15 universities			2
the decision was taken after a widespread cheating scandal was uncovered -- a number of scams were being employed to give some unscrupulous students and their parents advance warning about the questions to be included in the test			1
cramming schools according to education insiders in @entity3 , cheating has been going on for years with cramming schools known as " @entity28 " mostly to blame			1
hakwons provide extra lessons and coaching to ambitious children , who give up their evenings , weekends and holidays to study and revise for crucial exams			0
the @entity37 in @entity38 has confirmed it has so far raided several of @entity28 looking for evidence -- all 68 registered @entity41 being urgently inspected , according to media reports			2
the problem is there are hundreds of unregistered and unregulated cramming schools and tutors in the capital alone , who may be willing to cut corners to improve their results and earn themselves more customers			1
selling papers it is likely the scandal has tentacles extending across @entity57			0
brokers in @entity60 countries like @entity61 are understood to have acquired sat test papers in advance , selling them for large sums to middle men			2
at one of the raided schools in @entity3 , a flustered teacher insisted off camera that his @entity70 had done nothing wrong			1
but at another cramming school , not implicated in the scandal , vice principal @entity72 claimed cheating is well known among super ambitious " tiger " parents and their " cub " kids , as they are known here , with tens of thousands of dollars changing hands for the test papers			1
" the pressure is there to get the scores			0
they know there are some avenues where you can achieve higher results , through unsavory or unethical means , and this is a very combustible mixture , " he said			0
" we get a lot of tiger moms and tiger cubs , and that 's why all this hyper competition is happening and that 's why people are finding ways to you know skirt the system			0
" " just from the grapevine i have heard , tens of thousands of dollars ( changes hands ) for access to these tests			0
a lot of parents know where to go , whether it 's a subject text or @entity111			1
" difficult decision the @entity113 , which runs the @entity111 system , has issued a statement explaining why it canceled the may sat test in @entity3			1
" the @entity113 and @entity117 have made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the may 2013 administration of the sat and @entity119 at all test centers in the @entity3			1
" this action is being taken in response to information provided to @entity117 -- the @entity113 's vendor for global test administration and security -- by the @entity127 regarding tutoring companies in the @entity3 that are alleged to have illegally obtained @entity111 and @entity119 materials for their own commercial benefit			1
" the @entity113 and @entity117 explored every reasonable alternative to preserve the may 2013 administration before making the decision to cancel , and we recognize that this decision will be met with disappointment by the students in the @entity3 who planned to take the may 2013 sat or @entity119 as part of the college admission process			1
" plan ' b ' but hardworking students who have not cheated are being penalized by the cancellation of the test			0
at @entity3 's most expensive boarding school , @entity142 ( @entity143 ) on @entity144 , pupils are scrambling to make alternative arrangements to sit the sat in other countries like @entity148 or @entity149			1
eighteen - year - old @entity150 will sit her @entity111 test in @entity149 , much to the annoyance of her parents who will have to pay for the trip			2
she 's hoping to study architecture at the @entity157 in the @entity15 and needs a good @entity111 score to get in			2
@entity159 , 17 , wants to study engineering or economic management either in the @entity15 or @entity162 , but he 's going to have to wait for another sat test , possibly meaning he 'll miss his chance of going to university next year			0
his friend @entity166 needs a near perfect score of 2,300 out of a maximum 2,400 in his @entity168 to read physics and engineering in the @entity15 , so he 's traveling to @entity148 to sit the exam , despite speaking no @entity148			0
he admits it 's putting extra stress on him and may affect his score			0
" we are getting penalized for the fact that other people cheated or tried to cheat , " he tells me indignantly			0
@entity178 , a teacher at @entity143 , is concerned about the damage to the reputation of @entity3 's education system			2
" i just worry about the tarnish that @entity183 centers have received in this whole process and i worry therefore about the university places that are going to be offered to our students			0
" principal @entity188 is also worried , but says he 's not surprised that @entity3 's hyper competitive school system has produced a cheating scandal			1
" the nature of the @entity194 is that they have to be number one , they have to be top , the famous phrase in @entity3 is that ' a minus is the @entity198 , ' f so it has to be number one			0
