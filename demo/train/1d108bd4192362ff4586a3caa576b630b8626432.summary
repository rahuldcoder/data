after five years in captivity , sgt. @entity0 is free			1
but that 's hardly the end of the story			0
while the @entity7 man 's friends and family and the @entity10 administration are hailing his release , the deal that set him free is getting heat from critics who say @entity0 is a traitor who cost @entity18 lives and those who say the deal could cost @entity18 lives in the future			1
a captive @entity18 soldier returns home ... sounds like a good thing			1
why are some people so upset ? some fear that the deal will encourage hostage - taking and open a new era in which the @entity18 has to negotiate with terrorists			1
others say the administration may have broken the law by failing to notify @entity34 that it was letting terror detainees free from the military prison at @entity37 , @entity38			2
still others -- many of them @entity0 's fellow soldiers -- are queasy about the whole thing because of the questions that continue to swirl around his disappearance and claims that he may have deserted his post			1
do n't other countries make such swaps ? has n't the @entity18 ? of course			1
prisoner exchanges have been a feature of many @entity18 conflicts going back to the @entity51			1
and no student of @entity54 history could overlook the exchange of @entity57 2 pilot @entity56 for a @entity59 spy in 1962 , or of the several cloak - and - dagger spy exchanges conducted on @entity62 's @entity61			2
other countries , notably @entity64 , have also been known to negotiate prisoner swaps to gain the release of captive soldiers			2
one controversy here is a @entity18 law that requires the administration to give @entity34 notice 30 days before releasing any detainees from the military prison at @entity37			1
national security adviser @entity75 said sunday on @entity76 that the " acute urgency " of @entity0 's failing health and what she described as a narrow opportunity to win his freedom justified making the move without notifying @entity34			1
on monday , @entity84 chief of staff @entity83 defended the administration 's handling of the negotiations , saying @entity34 had known for years of negotiations for @entity0 's release , including the possibility that detainees might be released			1
but several @entity18 lawmakers on monday criticized the @entity84 's approach			1
sen. @entity94 , chairwoman of the @entity95 , told reporters on @entity97 monday that lawmakers on her committee should have been given a heads - up about the prisoner swap			1
" we had participated in a number of briefings some time ago , and there ( were ) considerable concerns , " the @entity103 @entity102 said			0
rep. @entity109 , chairman the @entity110 , said he planned to look into whether @entity10 broke the law by not notifying @entity34 30 days in advance			1
" i think it certainly merits further review , and that 's what i 'm going to do to make that determination , " the @entity114 @entity113 told @entity76 's @entity115			0
" it certainly does n't smell right to me			1
" so who is this guy , and how did he wind up getting captured , anyway ? friends describe him as a trustworthy and outgoing world traveler who joined the @entity125 in 2008			0
how he ended up captive remains a bit of a mystery			0
@entity18 officials have declined to go into detail , but soldiers in his platoon say he was pulling guard duty when he put down his weapons and walked off base			2
he reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing @entity18 activities in @entity140 , according to 2012 reporting by late @entity143 reporter @entity142			2
what are the soldiers who served with him saying ? bluntly , they resent any talk of @entity0 as a hero			2
they say he 's a deserter who should be put on trial , especially in light of the deaths of at least six @entity18 soldiers killed while looking for him			1
" i was pissed off then and i am even more so now with everything going on , " said @entity157 , who was in the same platoon as @entity0			2
" @entity0 deserted during a time of war and his fellow @entity18 lost their lives searching for him			1
" " i do n't understand why we 're trading prisoners at @entity165 for somebody who deserted during a time of war , which is an act of treason , " @entity157 said			2
are they right ? was he a deserter ? @entity18 officials are n't saying that , at least not directly			1
when asked about the issue sunday , defense secretary @entity172 sidestepped the question			0
" our first priority is assuring his well - being and his health and getting him reunited with his family , " @entity175 said			0
" other circumstances that may develop and questions , those will be dealt with later			0
" on monday , @entity185 spokesman adm. @entity184 said @entity18 officials " still do n't have a complete picture of what caused him to leave his base that night			1
" " but let 's not forget , he was held captive as a prisoner for five years			2
five years by himself , " @entity184 said			0
" that 's a pretty high price to pay for whatever impelled him to walk off that base			0
" so what 's next for him ? he 's at an @entity18 military hospital in @entity62 being evaluated by doctors and facing a lengthy repatriation and reintegration process			1
he 's in stable condition " receiving treatment for conditions that require hospitalization , " @entity205 said in a statement			0
beyond saying he requires attention to " dietary and nutrition needs , " the hospital did n't elaborate , citing medical privacy requirements			0
" the @entity218 staff is sensitive to what sgt. @entity0 has been through and will proceed with his reintegration at a pace with which he is comfortable , " the hospital said			2
those in charge of treating @entity0 are working to build up his confidence in them , a senior @entity185 official said , noting that @entity0 has n't been able to trust anyone for five years			1
doctors in @entity62 are evaluating his health and whether he 's ready to be transported , said @entity231 , a spokeswoman for @entity232			0
once doctors give the ok , a receiving team will travel there to facilitate his transport to @entity236 in @entity237 , @entity238			0
from there , he 'll head to the @entity240 , where a room is already ready for @entity0 and a support team is standing by , @entity231 said			2
he has n't yet talked to his family , @entity184 said			0
" that will obviously occur , but it wo n't occur until i think everybody believes it 's the right time , " he said			2
the first meeting between @entity0 and his parents may only last minutes , @entity231 said , depending on what psychologists recommend			0
once in the @entity18 , she said , @entity0 's daily routine will focus on four key areas : medical care , psychological support , debriefings and family support			1
" this is to help a person who has had no control of their own life for years now regain that control step by step , " she said			0
is it true he 's having trouble speaking @entity266 ? why ? yes , according to a senior @entity185 official , but the reasons for it are n't clear			0
it may be that he has n't used @entity266 since he was captured , instead speaking to his captors in @entity273 , the local language			0
@entity275 , a private contractor held by @entity278 insurgents for 10 months , said he did n't have trouble readjusting to @entity266 , but said he could n't talk for a while because he had been forced to stay silent under threat of death			0
" it 's like your vocal chords are like your muscles in your arms			0
if they do n't get any use , they get out of shape , " he told @entity76 's " @entity292			0
" what about these detainees the @entity18 let go ? should we worry about them ? according to senior @entity18 officials , they 're mid- to high - level officials from the @entity301 regime that ruled @entity140 when the @entity18 invaded the country			1
they include figures said to be linked to the late terror leader @entity305 , his @entity307 terror network and to abuses inside @entity140 during the @entity301 's rule			0
but @entity184 said monday that @entity18 officials have received assurances from @entity312 officials that the men " were not going to pose a direct threat to the national security of the @entity18			0
" he declined to go into detail , but according to a senior defense official , they will be subject to @entity312 supervision and a one - year travel ban			0
should we expect any more prisoner swaps or releases ? there are n't any other @entity18 military personnel being held , so there wo n't be any more swaps involving troops , at least			1
but it 's possible that @entity0 's release presages a broader release of @entity140 citizens from @entity37 , said @entity76 terrorism analyst @entity333			1
" at the end of hostilities , both sides typically swap prisoners , and we 're coming to the end of conventional hostilities between these two groups , " he said			1
the @entity341 said monday that the swap for @entity0 does n't set a precedent for other detained @entity18 military or diplomatic personnel , like former @entity341 contractor @entity346 in @entity38 or @entity349 - @entity18 missionary @entity348 in @entity350			1
" we look at each case differently , " @entity341 spokeswoman @entity351 told reporters			0
@entity0 " is a member of the military who was detained during an armed conflict			0
that , obviously , is a unique circumstance , " she said			0
" in any case , whether it 's @entity346 or @entity348 or others who are detained @entity18 citizens , we take every step possible to make the case and to ... take steps to ensure their return home to the @entity18			1
" what 's next for @entity0 ? fellow soldiers call @entity0 a deserter , not a hero			2

@entity94 : lawmakers should *'ve* gotten heads - up about prisoner swap
@entity109 : decision to swap prisoners without telling @entity34 " does n't smell right "
soldier 's release generates controversy and questions
some say the deal puts @entity18 at *greater* risk ; others question @entity0 's disappearance
