-- it debuted in obscurity on early morning cable tv and took off in a way that has " gobsmacked " its creators			1
the sitcom parody video , " @entity7 , " first aired on october 27 at 4 a.m. on @entity8 , @entity0 cousin late - night network			1
the 11 - minute video started making the rounds on social media after its creators uploaded the video to @entity15 on friday and it got a boost from @entity18 users			2
" we made too many cooks for @entity8 and think the level of response is more surreal even than the thing itself , " creators @entity19 and @entity21 said on @entity18			1
what 's fueling its popularity ? it 's hard to say , exactly , because there 's a lot going on in the video			1
but for those susceptible to pop culture nostalgia it 's hard to look away , despite the long run time			0
on the surface , the video is a parody of television intros from the 1980s , evoking quintessential motifs of the era , from sweater vests , side ponytails and tacky couches to twin actors playing a cute baby and an @entity49 - like creature named @entity50			2
the catchy jingle and ugly credit font bring to mind tv hits like " @entity54 , " " @entity55 " and " @entity56			0
" as the video moves from one genre to the next , introducing more characters in cop dramas , sitcoms and a @entity63 - like cartoon , a machete - wielding serial killer emerges , and things just get weirder and weirder			0
@entity65 plays a pie ? where does an idea like this come from ? " i 've always been a fan of humor that just pushes things past the point of funny , " @entity19 told @entity74			0
" when you watch those @entity78 routines , or the old @entity80 bits where he keeps repeating and repeating a joke until it becomes banal and irritating -- and then eventually works its way back to being hilarious again -- that , to me , is the funniest			0
so the notion was simply , what if you had this credits sequence to a @entity87 - type show that went on and on and on ... " whatever the appeal , it 's drawing raves from @entity92 heavy - hitters -- and head - scratching from others			1
what do you think of the video ? tell us in the comments .			0
