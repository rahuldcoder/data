-- @entity1 showed no mercy for earthquake - hit neighbors @entity4 as a fine bowling display earned the defending champions a seven - wicket victory at the @entity8 in @entity9 on friday			1
a minute 's silence was observed before the match to honor the victims of tuesday 's quake in @entity14 , which has left more than 110 people dead , and both teams -- wearing black armbands -- huddled together in a display of solidarity			1
but once the action began , the @entity20 struggled to perform after losing the toss and being sent into bat			0
when @entity24 became @entity26 's third victim with the last ball of the 17th over , @entity4 had collapsed to 73 - 6			2
@entity4 death toll rises @entity30 showed some resistance with 52 off 76 balls , and captain @entity33 hit a lusty 44 off 43 deliveries , but the @entity4 could bat only 45.1 of their allotted 50 overs to be all out for a disappointing 206			2
left - arm fast bowler @entity37 was the pick of the @entity40 bowlers with figures of 4 - 33 off 9.1 overs , while @entity26 took 3 - 35 from seven overs			0
@entity1 , seeking a fourth successive title and fifth overall , then made light work of the run chase to clinch a second win from two @entity50 games -- and 25th in a row at the four - yearly tournament			1
openers @entity53 ( 62 ) and @entity55 ( 55 ) put on 133 in just 18 overs , while vice-captain @entity57 ( 24 ) and @entity58 ( 22 ) were unbeaten as they came home with 16 overs to spare -- helped by a sloppy 29 wides from the @entity4 bowlers			2
@entity33 said the tragic events back home could not be used as an excuse for his team 's poor performance			2
" it would be unfair to the people who are going through a lot worse than we are over here to say that was the reason we did n't play very well today			0
we 're professional sportsmen and we have to get up for these games , " he told reporters in quotes carried by the @entity79 agency			0
@entity1 fast bowler @entity81 has been ruled out for the rest of the tournament , having also missed the opening win over @entity85 after suffering an ankle injury in a warm - up match			1
@entity89 all - rounder @entity88 will be out for four weeks after suffering a similar problem in thursday 's defeat by @entity92 , ending his participation unless his team reach the semifinals			0
in friday 's @entity98 action , @entity96 survived a big scare before avoiding a second consecutive defeat , beating @entity101 by 27 runs in @entity103			1
@entity96 , beaten by co-hosts @entity105 in the opening game of the tournament , were bowled out for just 205 in the final over despite making a roaring start on a slow pitch			1
opener @entity113 top - scored with 44 off 43 balls but after he was third man out with the total at 68 in the 12th over , captain @entity111 ( 36 ) and @entity112 ( 38 ) played patient innings to steady proceedings			0
however , @entity92 - born @entity120 ( 3 - 32 ) , left - arm spinner @entity118 ( 2 - 23 ) and @entity1 - born @entity119 ( 2 - 40 ) combined to give the @entity122 hope of repeating their win over @entity96 at the 2007 @entity125			1
and the run chase was looking good at 151 - 5 , but then @entity127 ( 37 ) became the first of four victims for young fast bowler @entity130 in the 37th over as the last six wickets fell for just 27 runs			1
on saturday , @entity133 , the third of the tournament 's hosts , take on @entity137 in a @entity50 match in @entity139			0
both teams won their opening matches .			0

@entity125 champions @entity1 *cruise* to victory against @entity4
@entity148 captain *insists* @entity14 earthquake was no excuse for poor display
co-hosts @entity96 boost *quarterfinal* hopes with 27 - run win over @entity101
@entity157 beat @entity96 at last @entity125 in 2007 , but *batsmen* wasted good start
