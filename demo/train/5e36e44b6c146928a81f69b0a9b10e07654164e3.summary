@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly 21 years ago , @entity3 landed her dream job as an adventure tour guide in the @entity6			1
but as she shared the area 's beauty and culture with tourists , she realized there was a darker side to the rainforest paradise			2
" i saw how poor they were and realized that people were dying because they did n't have medical care , " @entity14 said			1
she started sharing her supplies with the locals and soon began waking up to find people waiting outside her mosquito net to ask her for medicine			2
at one point , @entity14 -- who had no medical training -- gave someone stitches , following instructions from a book			2
" it was kind of scary , " she recalled			0
" if they 're depending on me for their health care ... we 're all going to die			1
" that 's when she decided to stay and do something more			2
since 1993 , @entity14 has been bringing medical relief to some of @entity1 's poorest and most remote areas through her nonprofit , now known as @entity40			1
@entity14 -- described by a visiting doctor as " sort of a cross between @entity44 and @entity45 and @entity46 " -- and her volunteers have provided free health care and education to more than 55,000 people			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity54 it 's hardly the life one could have predicted for this @entity58 , @entity59 , native , but she 's never followed an " ordinary " path			1
the daughter of postal workers , @entity14 headed to @entity63 after high school graduation and worked as a model , a @entity67 usherette and an @entity69 adoption counselor before going to @entity1 for a wildlife internship			1
when she was offered a job as an adventure tour guide , she jumped at the chance and has never looked back			1
today , she runs @entity40 from @entity0 , considered the most populous city in the world that ca n't be reached by road			0
it 's in the northeastern corner of the country , in the middle of the rainforest , and is the capital of @entity1 's largest and most remote region			1
nearly half of the area 's population lives in poverty , and one - third of residents lack access to basic medical care , according to @entity1 's @entity91			1
some might go their entire lives without seeing a doctor			2
that 's what @entity14 is working to change			2
she organizes several expeditions to these underserved areas every year			2
each trip is staffed by adventure - seeking medical volunteers from the @entity102 -- often from @entity104 medical schools -- and @entity6 health professionals			1
a traditional shaman , or healer , frequently accompanies them			0
dr. @entity109 met @entity14 while on a trip to the slums of @entity112 , near @entity0 , for the @entity113 ! @entity91 , dr. @entity114 ' health organization			2
" she 's an amazing person			0
she is sort of a cross between @entity44 and @entity45 and @entity46 , " @entity109 said			0
" she is a unique and focused individual who is serving the health needs of some of the ( poorest ) people in the world			1
" financed largely by the volunteers ' trip fees , @entity14 's teams travel around the region for up to four weeks at a time , holding free clinics for the local people			1
getting to these remote areas is @entity14 's biggest challenge			1
many of the villages take days to reach , often requiring travel by bus , helicopter and boat			0
large portions of these trips are made on the area 's winding rivers -- no easy feat when traveling with 30 to 40 containers of medical supplies			1
" sometimes we 're in dugout canoes ... and we 'll encounter major rapids , " @entity14 explained			0
" when that happens , you just need to get in and close your eyes			0
" in the villages , the volunteers provide preventive services such as prenatal checkups and general exams , but most of their time is spent treating a wide range of ailments like malaria , @entity159 , pneumonia , diarrhea , animal or snake bites , and parasites			0
teams usually see several hundred patients during each expedition			0
@entity14 also strives to empower the local population by training village health workers and educating villagers about hiv prevention , hygiene and sanitation			1
the group also works in some of the region 's most destitute urban areas			1
" we often see people that are even sicker right in the city than in the jungle , " she said			0
@entity14 hopes to build a permanent clinic in @entity112 , a slum on the outskirts of @entity0			0
she envisions providing services to the city 's poor , training for health workers and housing for villagers who come to the city for treatment			1
the government has donated land for the project , and @entity14 is working to raise the funds for construction			0
in the meantime , the group has built a simple structure where it will hold clinics twice a month			0
after 17 years , @entity14 still has yet to collect a salary for her work , and she lives in the group 's offices in @entity0			1
but while life on a shoestring budget is n't always easy , knowing that she 's having an impact keeps her motivated			0
" regardless of whether it 's getting to one person or 30 people or 300 people , you make a big difference , " she said			2
" anything i can offer them that is going to help them ... it 's just a real gift			0
" it 's a gift she plans to keep giving for as long as she can			0
" i 've found my purpose , " she said			0
" it certainly was n't what i had planned for my life , but you ca n't go against these forces of nature			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity40 web site and see how to help .			0
