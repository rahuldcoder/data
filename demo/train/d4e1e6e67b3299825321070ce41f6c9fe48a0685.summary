-- @entity1 , the @entity2 @entity1 , funds some of the world 's most far out , forward - thinking research into new military technology			1
something like @entity6 in the @entity8 movies , @entity1 is constantly working on what it describes as " radical innovations			1
" but where @entity8 has the character q to build his exploding pens , @entity1 often funds private companies and external organizations to develop its high - tech hardware			1
it is currently funding research into , among other things , a robot ostrich , a flying car and a plane that could stay airborne for five years at a time			1
while some of the technologies it is supporting might seem more suitable for science fiction than the battlefield , the fact that @entity1 is willing to fund them is a sign they are at least possible -- if not always plausible			1
do n't forget , @entity1 's @entity32 program is widely credited as being the precursor to today 's internet			1
so here are some of @entity1 's most incredible research programs , which could change the future of warfare , and might one day have applications that extend far beyond the military			1
@entity42 the disc - rotor is a collaboration between @entity1 and @entity45			1
hoping to marry the best features of a helicopter and an airplane , the @entity43 program aims to develop a new type of aircraft capable of a seamlessly transitioning from hovering like a helicopter to flying like a plane			1
the design is propelled by rotor blades that extend from a central disc , letting it take off and land like a helicopter			2
but those blades can also retract into the disc , minimizing drag and letting the @entity43 fly like a plane , powered by engines beneath each wing			2
vulture @entity1 's vulture program is developing the technology to enable an " airborne payload " to remain in the sky for more than five years at a time , performing intelligence , surveillance and communication missions			1
in practice , that means developing unmanned aircraft that act like satellites			0
@entity45 is again working on the project , researching its " @entity78 , " a solar - powered , unmanned craft with a 120 - meter wing span			0
it is designed to operate at altitudes above 18,000 meters			0
@entity45 hopes it will make its first demonstration flight in 2014			0
@entity83 tech company @entity84 worked with @entity1 on its " @entity83 " program			1
the aim was to build soft , flexible robots that could deform their bodies to move through openings smaller than themselves ( e.g. under doors ) to carry out covert tasks			0
@entity84 used a transitional -- or " jamming " -- material , with properties of both a solid and a liquid , to create a flexible robot that can crawl on six floppy legs			2
while @entity1 's funding has now expired , @entity84 is still researching soft robotics and " jamming " technology			1
@entity104 ( @entity103 droids ) @entity1 also funded @entity84 to research its @entity104 program			1
the aim was to give soldiers reliable communications in urban areas by creating pocket - sized robots they could scatter as they moved through an area			0
the robots would each act as a node in a wireless communications network			0
as the soldiers move , the robots would autonomously move with them , filling gaps in the network			0
according to @entity84 , the @entity121 it created weighed around one pound , was highly mobile and used a flipper mechanism for self righting and obstacle climbing			0
following the @entity1 research , @entity84 has developed a throwable robot for soldiers that will be available from 2012			1
it says the robot could be used to investigate hard - to - access places such as tunnels and ditches			2
@entity133 the ultimate goal of the @entity133 ( @entity136 - 2 ) program is to create a vehicle that can fly anywhere in the world in less than an hour -- while enduring temperatures in excess of 1,925 @entity142 )			1
@entity1 has already produced and flown a test @entity136 -- an unmanned , rocket - launched aircraft that travels at @entity145 ( about 13,000 miles per hour )			1
at that speed a flight between @entity147 and @entity148 would take less than 12 minutes			0
@entity133 made its maiden flight in april 2010 , but crashed into the @entity151 after just nine minutes			1
a second flight , in august 2011 , lasted a similar time before meeting the same end			0
following the second flight @entity136 program manager @entity155 said : " we do not yet know how to achieve the desired control during the aerodynamic phase of flight			2
it 's vexing ; i 'm confident there is a solution			0
we have to find it			0
" @entity165 this " robot ostrich , " called @entity170 , is a joint project between @entity1 , @entity167 and the @entity168 ( @entity168 )			1
it aims to build a two - legged robot that can cover a moderately rough terrain " as fast as the best human sprinters			2
" the @entity175 group has been running computer models it says show that when built , its robot could go from zero to 20 miles per hour in 15 seconds , with a top speed of 27 mph			1
an @entity180 400 - meter runner moves at around a 20.5 mph			0
why an ostrich ? because it 's the fastest two - legged animal on land , said @entity184 , a research scientist with the @entity168			1
" all the inspiration is coming from the ostrich so we spent a lot of time studying ostriches and trying to figure out which movements are essential to its locomotion , " said @entity184			2
the team plans to build and test a real robot in 2012			2
@entity197 communication satellites orbit more than 20,000 miles above the @entity200			2
when they break they usually have to be replaced by launching a new satellite , even though many of these broken satellites still have usable parts , such as antennae and solar arrays			0
the @entity197 program is trying to find a way to remove and re-use valuable components from broken or " retired " satellites -- in essence , recycling space junk			2
@entity1 envisions small " satlets " or " nano satellites " being carried to a broken communication satellite by a " tender " satellite , and then robotically attaching to the broken satellite 's antenna			1
but before it can become reality they must develop new robotics and remote imaging systems , and design grappling tools to grip , cut , and modify satellite parts			0
shrike @entity1 has funded aerospace company @entity232 's development of the shrike -- a vertical take - off - and - landing unmanned aircraft " small enough to be carried in a backpack			1
" intended for use in military surveillance , the @entity233 has four rotors and is equipped with a high - resolution camera that transmits real - time video			0
it can hover in place for up to 40 minutes and can also land , or " perch , " in a discrete location and transmit video from its perch for several hours			0
once it 's finished filming it takes off vertically and flies back to base			0
transformer the transformer program aims to build a flying car for the battlefield			1
and the car will need to fly itself			2
the aim is to create a vertical take - off - and - landing vehicle that can carry four people more than 250 miles on one tank of fuel			2
six contractors are working on the project , including @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 ( @entity264 )			0
@entity265 , a @entity264 research professor of robotics , said : " in practical terms ... the vehicle will need to be able to fly itself , or to fly with only minimal input from the operator			0
and this means that the vehicle has to be continuously aware of its environment and be able to automatically react in response to what it perceives			0
" @entity277 ( @entity278 ) the @entity277 program is developing binoculars that can identify threats from a long distance and then inform a soldier of the danger			0
it will use wide - angle optics and digital imaging , but the really clever bit is its use of " cognitive visual processing algorithms " and " operator neural signature detection processing			0
" that means monitoring the subconscious patterns in a soldier 's brain to detect a threat the soldier has perceived before they are even consciously aware of it			0
@entity300 ( @entity301 ) the @entity300 ( @entity301 ) program is developing a tiny , ultra-light air vehicle for indoor and outdoor military missions			1
the program has already produced an impressive prototype robotic hummingbird , complete with fast - flapping wings that let it hover and fly .			2

@entity2 @entity1 funds tech research
current projects include a robot ostrich , a flying car and a helicopter / plane *hybrid*
@entity300 program has built a tiny flying " robot hummingbird "
@entity133 plane has already flown at 13,000 miles per hour
