flanked by @entity2 politicians in front of the @entity4 on a july day , then - sen. @entity0 made a forceful appeal for the @entity6 to back @entity7 as the @entity2 nation 's forces squared off against @entity10 during the @entity11			1
" we will stand with @entity7 because @entity7 is standing for @entity6 values as well as @entity7 ones , " said @entity12			1
@entity12 was an outspoken defender of @entity7 and representative for @entity17 for eight years in the @entity18			1
but it was n't always that way			0
she had to work hard for @entity2 support in 2000 as the @entity24 jewish community was skeptical of her support for @entity7 and publicly wondered whether the former first lady was too sympathetic with the @entity27			1
but by the time she ran for president in 2008 , a number of @entity29 said her record with the community was unprecedented			0
touting her foreign policy credentials and defense of @entity7 , @entity2 leaders flocked to @entity12 as she ran against @entity38 in the @entity40 primaries			1
but after losing to @entity38 , @entity12 signed on to be the new president 's secretary of state and the face of his foreign policy			1
over the next four years , some @entity2 leaders said @entity12 's once - consistent , outspoken leadership on @entity7 was hamstrung by her role as @entity38 's top diplomat			1
@entity38 and @entity50 : time running out for even a framework for @entity53 talks many applauded when she talked tough on @entity55 , like in 2010 when she labeled the country as one with an " anti-semitic president and hostile nuclear ambitions " or when she said in @entity60 that " @entity55 is moving toward a military dictatorship			2
" but many also winced quietly when she floated trial balloons about a nuclear deal with @entity55 , like in a 2010 interview with the @entity66 in which @entity12 said @entity55 could enrich uranium for civilian purposes if it came into compliance with international norms			0
as @entity12 mulls another run for the presidency in 2016 , there are questions in the @entity2 community about whether her time at @entity78 has shifted her standing on issues important to @entity17			1
to some , the foreign policy experience she developed will just further endear her to a bloc of voters one leader described as " extraordinarily cosmopolitan on foreign affairs			0
" but to others , including a number of @entity29 , @entity12 's ties to the @entity38 administration -- a presidency that some @entity2 leaders say is not strong enough on @entity7 and too focused on working out a nuclear deal with @entity55 -- has not helped her standing with @entity6 jews			1
" on the amorphous level , that she was part of the administration , there may be some residual weakening , " said one @entity2 leader in @entity96 who asked for anonymity to speak more candidly			0
other @entity2 leaders see it as a mixed bag that @entity12 will have to define before she decides about her political future			2
" at a minimum , her four years in the secretary 's office did not hurt her in the community , even as the president got beat up in some corners of the community , " said another @entity2 leader with ties to @entity12			1
" i do n't know it especially helped her among @entity2 , but it did n't hurt her			0
" tapping into the @entity12 mystique @entity2 leaders questioning @entity12 's standing is particularly interesting when the @entity12 family 's longstanding ties with the community is considered			1
those ties are so great that @entity12 -- a @entity126 born in @entity127 -- is jokingly considered and honorary @entity2 to some leaders			1
" her husband was like the first @entity2 president , " joked one @entity2 @entity129			1
others said the @entity135 ' understanding of the community was better than any other @entity6 politicians			2
@entity12 is also helped by history			0
despite the fact that conservatives have long hypothesized that @entity6 @entity2 would begin to vote more @entity142 because of party 's positions on taxes and @entity7 , the past two decades have shown the opposite			1
according to a 2012 report by @entity149 , a nonpartisan public policy organization , @entity2 support for @entity29 has grown since the 1990s			2
when @entity142 @entity152 won the presidency in 1980 and 1984 , he garnered between 31 % and 37 % of the @entity2 votes			0
but starting in 1992 , when @entity12 was first elected to the @entity155 , @entity6 @entity2 began to gravitate to the @entity40			1
in fact , at no point between 1990 to 2008 has a @entity40 candidate for the presidency won less than 70 % of the @entity2 vote			0
in 2008 , @entity38 won nearly three - quarters of the @entity2 vote			2
but history is also changing			0
in 2012 , @entity38 became the first @entity40 presidential candidate since @entity163 in 1976 to win less than 70 % of the @entity2 vote when 69 % of the community supported the president			1
" the majority of @entity6 @entity2 are @entity169 , " said @entity166 , executive director of the @entity167			2
" but in the @entity167 segment of the community , president @entity38 is less popular			2
i think it remains to be seen whether , for the @entity167 community , that translates into some baggage for @entity0			2
" since leaving the @entity177 , @entity12 has appeared at a number of fundraiser for @entity2 groups where she has been well - received			2
in october 2013 , @entity12 was the keynote speaker at the $ 5,000 - a - plate @entity182 of @entity184 fundraising luncheon			0
in january 2014 , @entity12 was one of a few speakers at the memorial service for @entity187 , a longtime @entity12 supporter and stalwart in the @entity2 community			1
a @entity2 leader in @entity24 who attended the event told @entity192 that speaking at the memorial was a " huge coup " for @entity12 because " everyone who is anyone in the @entity2 community will be there			1
" @entity12 documents show ' west wing ' mindset some explaining to do on @entity55 @entity12 will have a chance to tout her bona fides with jewish - americans on wednesday when she is honored by @entity203 , the head of @entity204 , at an event in @entity24			2
according to @entity203 , a @entity2 leader with extensive ties to the @entity135 , the event is an opportunity for @entity12 to talk about issues that are important to the @entity2 @entity6 community			1
@entity203 specifically pointed out that " the community " would like to know where @entity12 stands on the deal the @entity6 and five other @entity214 nations struck with @entity55 over its nuclear program			1
" we now have this deal with @entity55 brewing , " @entity203 said			0
" the community would like to know where she would come out on these @entity55 discussion taking place			0
how does she see the future outcome out if ? " while the agreement struck in november was preliminary , it dials back @entity55 's ability to work toward a nuclear weapon and at the same time loosens the chokehold of international sanctions on @entity55 's economy			0
some @entity6 @entity2 have been critical of the deal , and @entity7 prime minister @entity234 has labeled the deal a " historic mistake " that " has made the world a much more dangerous place			1
" @entity203 was quick to correctly point out that @entity12 was n't in office when the deal with @entity55 was struck			0
this distance , he said , gave the former secretary of state a " sort of the restart button here on @entity55 policy because @entity55 policy has changed			0
" but the former first lady has already publicly helped @entity38 by rebuffing congressional attempts to impose more sanctions on @entity55 as negotiations play out			0
in a letter to @entity254 chairman @entity253 in february , @entity12 wrote that while she was " a long - time advocate for crippling sanctions against @entity55 , " now was the time to " do everything we can to test whether they can advance a permanent solution			0
" for some @entity6 @entity2 leaders , that letter was a troubling sign			2
" having thrown her support to the president 's approach on the @entity55 issue , she is now really tied herself to his policy , " @entity166 said			0
" if somehow that policy does not succeed , that is something she is going to have a lot of explaining to do			0
" @entity203 came close to echoing @entity166 's sentiment			0
" she was n't part of ( the @entity55 deal ) , " @entity203 said , but " does she support it ? " the answer to that question " will bring up some questions of her views in comparison to the administration 's			0

some in @entity6 jewish community *associate* @entity0 with @entity38 's @entity7 policy
some wonder if @entity12 's position on @entity7 has changed as she ponders @entity155 run
@entity12 's husband @entity292 is jokingly *referred* to as the " first @entity2 president "
