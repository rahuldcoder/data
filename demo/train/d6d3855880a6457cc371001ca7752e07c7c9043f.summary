-- it may have been @entity2 's most dramatic moment as president so far , and it certainly did n't go unmentioned as he accepted the @entity5 nomination for a second term thursday night			1
speaker after speaker reminded the audience in the convention hall and beyond that @entity12 leader @entity11 -- the mastermind of 9/11 , public enemy no. 1 for a decade -- had been gunned down by @entity14 commandos in @entity15 16 months ago			2
they reminded everyone that it was @entity2 who had given the order			0
some of them also used the opportunity to question whether @entity2 's challenger , @entity23 presidential nominee @entity22 , would have made the same call			1
" after more than 10 years without justice for thousands of @entity14 murdered on 9/11 -- after @entity22 said it would be ' naive ' to go into @entity15 to pursue the terrorists -- it took president @entity2 , against the advice of many , to give that order to finally rid this earth of @entity11 , " said sen. @entity25 , @entity26			1
" ask @entity11 if he is better off now than he was four years ago			0
" fact check : the not - so - empty factory vice president @entity36 , meanwhile , recounted the day in the @entity37 when @entity2 made the decision to launch the raid , " and justice was done			2
" " @entity41 , governor @entity22 did n't see things that way			0
when he was asked about @entity11 in 2007 , he said , and i quote , ' it 's not worth moving heaven and @entity48 and spending billions of dollars just to catch one person , ' " @entity36 said to boos from the audience			1
the facts : in august 2007 , @entity2 explicitly warned that if @entity14 authorities identify a " high - value " target like @entity11 in @entity15 , and if @entity15 's government does n't act , " we will			1
" @entity22 , then mounting his first @entity37 bid , criticized @entity2 's speech a few days later			1
" i mean , in one week , he went from saying he 's going to sit down , you know , for tea , with our enemies , but then he 's going to bomb our allies , " @entity22 said during a @entity23 debate			2
" i mean , he 's gone from @entity64 to dr. @entity65 in one week			0
" he added , " we do n't say those things			0
we keep our options quiet			0
we do not go out and say to a nation which is working with us , where we have collaborated and they are our friend and we 're trying to support @entity72 and strengthen him and his nation , that instead that we intend to go in there and potentially bring out a unilateral attack			0
" @entity22 already had been pressed by his @entity23 rivals to clarify remarks he 'd made about @entity11 that april , when he told @entity78 that " it 's not worth moving heaven and @entity48 and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person			1
" but he also said that he would target the entire @entity12 terror network , not just its leader			0
he defended the comments at another @entity23 presidential debate , saying the movement was " more than @entity11			2
but he is going to pay , and he is going to die			0
" this may , a year after the raid , @entity22 complained that the @entity2 administration was politicizing the raid when it cited those comments			2
in defending his position again , @entity22 said it was n't the idea of striking at @entity11 on the territory of an ally that bothered him -- it was that @entity2 said publicly that he would do so			1
" there are many people who believed as i did that it was naive on the part of the president , at the time as a candidate , to say he would go into @entity15 , " @entity22 said			0
" it was a very -- if you will -- a fragile and flammable time in @entity15 , and i thought it was a mistake of him as a candidate for the presidency of the @entity14 to announce that he would go in			0
" fact check : @entity114 arithmetic holds up on jobs during the 2008 campaign , @entity22 was n't the only one critical of @entity2 , who had been elected to the @entity118 only four years earlier			0
among those who called his position " naive " were @entity2 's eventual @entity23 opponent , sen. @entity122 ; and @entity36 , then one of his @entity5 rivals			1
both used the term " naive " to describe @entity2 's counterterrorism speech			2
when @entity2 did order the raid , he did it against the advice of some of his top aides			0
then - defense secretary @entity131 has said he wanted to hit the compound where @entity11 was holed up from the air rather than dispatch a @entity135 seal team , while @entity36 said in january that he advised @entity2 that more details needed to be checked before sending in troops			1
conclusion : @entity22 was critical of @entity2 's position in the days following the future president 's august 2007 speech			1
@entity36 's speech thursday night left out some context about @entity22 's remarks , and @entity25 mischaracterized @entity22 's comments -- @entity22 did n't say attacking targets in @entity15 was naive but talking about it publicly was			1
also , @entity36 himself once characterized @entity2 's comments as naive			1
fact check : would @entity22 bankrupt @entity150 by 2016 ? @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
