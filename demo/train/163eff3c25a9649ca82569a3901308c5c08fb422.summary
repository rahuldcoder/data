dressed in police and army uniforms , the suicide bombers placed themselves among the security officials lined up to cast their ballots			0
the soldiers and police were waiting to vote early , ahead of wednesday 's parliamentary elections -- @entity8 's first nationwide polls since the withdrawal of @entity11 forces at the end of 2011			1
but the men , charged with protecting polling stations and voters on election day , came under attack themselves as the militants detonated explosives , killing and injuring dozens of people across the country			2
in an apparent attempt to derail the balloting process and discourage the rest of @entity8 's 21.5 million registered voters from going to the polls , suicide bombers struck several polling stations as well as other locations in a wave of attacks in @entity32 and northern @entity8 on monday and tuesday			1
with a surge in car bombings , assassinations and suicide attacks , the vote -- the fourth national election since the fall of longtime leader @entity40 in 2003 -- is being held amid rapidly growing violence reaching levels not seen in more than five years			1
across villages and cities in the shattered nation , the echoing deep boom of explosions has become all too familiar for @entity8			1
" we depend on @entity50 each time we leave the house , because you do n't know what fate holds for you , " one man said			2
wave of attacks shootings and explosions across the country on monday killed 53 people and wounded more than 100 others			0
in addition to the targeted polling stations , a suicide attacker killed at least 18 people and wounded 33 others at a @entity68 political gathering in the town of @entity70 , 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) northeast of @entity32			0
the gathering was in celebration of @entity8 president @entity73 , who appeared on television casting his vote in @entity76 where he has been getting medical treatment			1
on tuesday , at least 12 people were killed when twin roadside bombs exploded in a busy outdoor market in @entity81 , about 120 kilometers northeast of @entity32			0
another 18 were wounded , police officials told @entity83			0
@entity8 has tightened security measures ahead of the elections , banning vehicles from the streets on tuesday night and closing roads in and out of the capital			1
but on the eve of the polls , the country is fast returning to the horrors of its recent past			0
prime minister @entity95 is battling for a third term in office but faces fierce opposition from political opponents , with sectarian violence at its most intense in more than five years			1
deadly year @entity8 has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months , often pitting @entity102 -- a minority in @entity8 -- against @entity104 , who came to dominate the government after @entity40 was overthrown in 2003			1
the @entity107 said 2013 was the deadliest year in @entity8 since 2008 , with more than 8,800 people killed , most of them civilians			2
tensions continue to be fueled by widespread discontent among the @entity102 , who say they are marginalized by the @entity104 - led government and unfairly targeted by heavy - handed security tactics			0
@entity102 anger has made it easier for @entity117 - linked militants to recruit and operate while eroding the public 's cooperation with security forces			0
@entity122 flared just a few months ago because of the arrest of a @entity102 lawmaker in @entity126 's capital , @entity127 , and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in @entity131 and @entity127			0
@entity8 's security forces , trained by the @entity11 at a cost of billions of dollars , have been unable to dislodge the militants and instead are fighting pitched battles			1
other endemic problems gripping the country include high unemployment levels , dilapidated infrastructure and services , and chronic corruption			0
oil revenues have failed to improve the lives of most @entity8			2
the vote the dire security situation in which the elections are going ahead is reminiscent of the country 's first post-hussein elections in 2005 , when threats from @entity117 insurgents led to minimal turnouts in most @entity102 provinces			0
@entity95 , whose @entity153 alliance is seen as a front - runner , on tuesday called on @entity8 to take part in the vote			1
" your presence and your insistence to exercise your legitimate national and historical right represents a real response to the terrorists and sectarianism and those who stand behind them , " he said in a statement			0
some 277 political entities across @entity8 will compete for 328 seats of the @entity168 , the country 's parliament			1
the voting has been canceled in parts of @entity126 province , controlled by jihadists and tribesmen			0
" it does n't bode well for stability if the electoral results do not reflect an accurate representation of the political realities on the ground , " @entity177 , nonresident fellow at the @entity178 , told @entity83			0
" what 's more worrisome is , what happens next ? will the government double down on a military offensive in @entity126 ? does fighting intensify between @entity102 tribes ? does @entity95 take advantage to exploit the divisions ? does the violence eventually spill over into @entity32 ? will @entity126 be neglected , whereby it converges closer to the adjacent insurgency inside @entity195 ? as is always the case with @entity8 , nothing is inevitable , anything is possible			1
" observing from outside following the last parliamentary election in 2010 , it took nearly eight months of intense backdoor negotiations for @entity8 's bickering politicians to finally form a government			1
this time , though , there are no @entity11 forces on the ground , and @entity208 will be watching from afar			2
" the @entity11 is facing a dire situation in @entity8 , whereby both instability in the political and security realms are converging , " @entity177 said			1
" if there is no resolution in the upcoming post-election saga in forming a government , @entity8 's security situation is expected to worsen			2
unlike past electoral cycles , the @entity11 lacks the influence to bring about a resolution , and without its military presence , the psychological effect that helped pacify political behavior is no longer there as a coolant			1
" @entity8 's neighbors will also be keeping an eye out for any serious implications in a region that is still coming to terms with the geopolitical effects of the @entity232			2
for @entity235 , the unity of the @entity104 political class is a core interest , because it determines the depth and scope of its influence in @entity8 , @entity177 said			1
" a new emerging interest for @entity241 could be the maintenance of the status quo in @entity32 , " he said			0
" the ousting of @entity95 could symbolically undermine @entity241 's efforts in safeguarding the survival of the @entity195 regime in @entity248			2
