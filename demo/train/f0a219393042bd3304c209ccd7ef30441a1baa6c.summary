most of the time reading comments on the @entity1 is like attending a slightly dysfunctional family dinner , full of passionately argued , half - baked political theories and tasteless jokes			1
wandering into a @entity6 comments section , however , can be like walking into a dive bar bathroom , walls and mirrors covered in graffiti as profane as it is pointless			2
last month at @entity13 , an audience member asked @entity14 , a head of product at @entity6 , what he could do about the terrible comments on his @entity6 channel			0
according to @entity19 , @entity14 responded , " we 're working on some improvements to the comment system , so hopefully we 'll have an update on that in the next few months			0
" time.com : how @entity27 's phantom taxes hide billions in profit apparently he was n't lying			0
try to comment on a video today and a window will pop up with the title " start using your full name on @entity6 , " which will sign you in with your @entity35 account			1
a @entity6 spokesperson told @entity39 that this option has been offered since june 29 and that users with a @entity35 account will see the same thing if they try to upload a video			1
if you do n't want to use your @entity35 account , you can refuse -- but then you 're taken to a second prompt , which asks " are you sure ? " then , like some kind of @entity1 degenerate , you must explain why you do n't want to use your full name			2
time.com : @entity50 responds to shootings in a way most media organizations ca n't most of the reasons provided involve the user being a business or product , although you can choose the mysterious " my channel is for personal use , but i can not use my real name , " useful if you are cruising @entity6 as a member of the witness protection program			0
it would have been more honest if @entity6 had included , " i 'm a jerk and would like to troll comment sections anonymously , " but sadly that 's not an option			2
still , it 's important to remember that not everyone on the site is a bored troll looking to mock watchers of @entity74 videos			0
time.com : the 20 best @entity77 mods ( so far ) recently @entity6 launched its own face - blurring tool , a valuable tool for protesters trying to protect themselves from government recrimination			1
that pretty much sums up why @entity6 will ( hopefully ) never completely take away the option to comment anonymously			1
balancing the needs for free speech and civility is a tricky proposition that , quite frankly , no website has completely figured out			0
this is definitely a step in the right direction for @entity6 ; whether or not its users will actually start using their real names is another question			1
this article originally appeared on @entity95 : @entity6 wants you to comment using your real name			0

@entity6 is *encouraging* the use of full names in its comment section
users can comment anonymously but must explain why
recent @entity6 changes include video face - blurring tech to protect protesters
it may be a step towards making the @entity1 more civil , but will users comply ?
