born on safari in @entity2 in 1942 , @entity0 developed a taste for adventure at an early age			1
he co-founded luxury exploration company @entity7 in 1962 , taking small groups of travelers into @entity10 with comforts once reserved only for royalty			1
proper linens ! caviar ! with his expedition company marking its 50th anniversary this year , @entity14 now oversees premium excursions to more than 100 countries			1
in a spirited interview with @entity22 , the 70 - year - old adventurer reviews his career , casts an eye toward future adventure and shares remarkable photos from his personal collection			1
@entity22 : can you recall the first safari you ran in @entity10 in 1962 ? @entity14 : it was a monthlong safari with my father for a lovely couple , a husband and wife			1
we started in @entity10 and drove to @entity38 , stopping at @entity39 and @entity40 , then crossed into the @entity41 where we saw pygmies			1
i remember we even went water skiing on @entity44 , which has no crocodiles			1
the area was called the " @entity47 " because it was so beautiful			1
@entity22 : what were the moveable camps like back then ? @entity14 : the original @entity52 tents had poles in the middle for support and tarpaulins on the ground			1
setting them up took a long time , since there might be a hundred poles			1
we eventually color - coded them to simplify the process -- red meets red , yellow meets yellow			1
the beds were low cots , just a few inches off the ground , with mosquito netting draped over them			1
we used paraffin lamps for light at night			1
in the morning a basin of hot water would be set out on a small table just outside the entrance of your tent so you could shave and wash			1
one toilet for the entire camp would be located about 10 meters away			1
it was simply a toilet seat mounted on a box over a pit lined with lime			1
when choosing a place to set up camp , the most important thing was to find a " shower tree			2
" you needed a sturdy branch at just the right height to hang a 10 - liter canvas bucket for showers			2
this was especially important to the ladies			2
@entity22 : you encouraged portable iceboxes so guests could enjoy sundowners on safari			2
what other luxuries did you bring to the safari ? @entity14 : @entity103 , caviar , smoked salmon			2
@entity22 : what sort of guests did you attract back then ? @entity14 : our clients are experience seekers : educated , active , accomplished professionals and entrepreneurs with an intense curiosity about the world			2
but when we started , traveling to @entity114 was something only the wealthiest could afford			2
@entity22 : scariest safari experience ? @entity14 : i was with @entity119 in @entity10			1
we had just sat down for sundowners and i walked over to the mess tent to refresh his drink			2
i heard a roar behind me and a lot of screaming and turned to see four lions bringing down a buffalo in our campfire ! i quickly upended the table , sending the crystal and china flying , and gathered the guests behind it as a barricade			2
what an amazing spectacle to watch ! the next day @entity119 wanted to know if we could do it again			1
he thought i planned the whole thing			2
@entity22 : how has @entity10 changed since that first safari ? @entity14 : when i was growing up , @entity10 was very much the wide open spaces you see in " @entity143			2
" the @entity144 and @entity145 still offer that same sense of space , but the growing population means that farms are encroaching on the land surrounding the game reserves			0
and traffic in @entity153 rivals the most congested cities in the @entity155			0
@entity22 : how does a @entity10 safari compare to ones in other @entity159 nations ? @entity14 : @entity114 and @entity160 offer different safari experiences			1
traditionally , the migration has made @entity114 the must - see destination for first - time safari goers			0
but in recent years , the world - class hotels and restaurants in @entity167 have been attracting guests who want a holiday that combines game viewing with gourmet food , interesting local wines and romantic accommodations			0
@entity114 remains the most popular safari destination			0
the large numbers of herd animals -- wildebeest , zebra , antelope -- and the drama of the migration attract many visitors to @entity10 and @entity183 -- but in places like the @entity186 you are likely to see many other vehicles during a game drive			0
if travelers are looking for a more traditional " @entity143 " experience , i recommend our @entity193 - style mobile - tented camps			0
@entity167 is a more developed safari destination with cosmopolitan cities , world - class hotels and fine restaurants			0
in national parks like @entity201 or @entity202 , guests are likely to see vehicles from many different safari lodges , so for those seeking solitude , choose lodges that offer game drives on adjacent private lands			0
@entity22 : we 've had good luck in @entity212			0
@entity14 : @entity212 limits the numbers of safari - goers			0
we recommend the exclusive @entity215 in the @entity216 -- it 's considered the predator capital of @entity114 , with lions , leopards , cheetah , painted dogs , hyenas and jackals along with elephants , giraffe , zebra , wildebeest and impala			0
here , you find small luxury tented camps with game viewing in open vehicles and the rare opportunity for walking safaris and night game drives			1
@entity237 relatively unknown outside @entity114 , @entity2 offers a diverse range of environments with prolific wildlife			0
walking safaris were pioneered here ; if you have only seen animals from inside a vehicle , you will find walking with big game a thrilling experience			1
night drives are also a specialty , and the best means of seeing some of the more elusive nocturnal species , including leopards			0
@entity22 : most memorable encounter with wildlife ? @entity14 : i was studying elephants with @entity256 on the shores of @entity258 in @entity183			0
he wanted to introduce me to a new matriarch he had found named @entity261			0
she charged us and picked up our @entity264 with her tusks and pushed us nine or 10 meters along the ground ! @entity22 : favorite place ? @entity14 : the @entity268 would be at the top of my list			0
i love to be active and there you can swim , snorkel and scuba dive with sea lions and turtles and stroll through colonies of penguins and blue - footed boobies -- they have no fear of humans			0
but i also love @entity2 , where i was born while my parents were on safari			0
@entity22 : is there a country you do n't operate in that 's on your radar ? @entity14 : we do n't operate in @entity291 yet , but it has so much history with incredible archaeological sites			0
i was also hoping to take people to see the bonobo chimpanzees in the @entity41 , but that 's on hold for the moment			0
@entity22 : what will the @entity159 safari experience be like in 20 or 30 years ? @entity14 : there will always be @entity159 safaris			1
enlightened countries like @entity212 and @entity2 understand the importance of sustainable tourism and are protecting their wilderness and wildlife			0
both are rich in natural resources and have small populations relative to their size .			0
