@entity0 -- on the eve of the inauguration , president @entity3 's second term may also be @entity7 's second chance			1
the country , in the last four years , has been battered by an economic earthquake while trying to reconcile a debt load threatening to cripple the next generation			1
it has been pulled apart by political extremism and the inability to compromise in @entity0			0
the people have been divided -- by demographic shifts , cultural battles and clashes between the rich and the poor , the haves and the have - nots			2
so , days before the president 's second inaugural , the nation , too , is set to regroup			1
what it does differently this time around and the decisions the people make , experts say , will speak to the kind of @entity7 that emerges during the next four years			1
second inaugural address puts @entity3 in select company " the enormous promise that everyone felt four years ago , it is n't completely gone but we have diminished our horizons , " said @entity32 , an american studies professor at the @entity33			1
" we have learned that we are now living in an era of limits			0
" @entity3 is perhaps more keenly aware of this than most			1
@entity42 and hurdles the 44th president was ushered into the @entity45 by a wave of seemingly limitless optimism and buoyed by the historic nature of his presidency as the first @entity50 elected to the lead the free world			2
but once in office , he found his efforts to right an economy hobbled by high unemployment -- 10 % at its worse in 2009 -- and home foreclosure rates -- one in 29 homes were in foreclosure between 2007 and 2012 -- were limited by the magnitude of the problem and the political realities of a partisan @entity65			2
his plan to reform the nation 's healthcare system further expanded political divides in @entity0 and helped lead to huge losses among his party 's moderates in the 2010 election			1
his re-election this fall — due in no small part to demographic shifts that included large numbers of minorities and women — was quickly followed by a protracted and deeply partisan showdown over trimming the nation 's debt			1
by the numbers : presidential inaugurations " i think @entity3 has learned some things , " said @entity86 , director of @entity88 's @entity87			1
" he 's going to be unlike most second term presidents in that he will be far more assertive than he was in his first term			1
he will be stronger on pushback against some of the most extreme elements in the @entity96			0
he 's willing to go to battle on the whole concept of getting the economy moving			1
" the public saw hints of that assertiveness on monday during a surprise news conference , where he lashed out at @entity103 in @entity65 for playing politics with the debt ceiling			0
" we are not a deadbeat nation , " @entity3 said during a nearly hour - long briefing from the @entity107 of the @entity108			1
it a newly combative tone , he called it " absurd " for the federal government not to pay " bills that have already been racked up " and said he will not negotiate " with a gun at the head of the @entity50 people			0
" from @entity119 to the economy to @entity121 over the next four years , the country will also get a chance to see whether the @entity119 -- or " @entity119 " -- is a positive or negative step for the nation			1
in 2014 , many of the most controversial provisions , including requiring individuals to either participate in a health insurance program or pay a penalty , take effect			0
" we will see whether or not we have the strength within ourselves to figure out how we should deal with entitlement programs , " @entity32 said			0
" in a way , it 's a period when the administration will be dealing with problems that are in process			2
" @entity3 's ability -- or failure -- to navigate all of this while coming off as a strong , levelheaded leader could help set the nation 's tone for years to come			1
" if the economy becomes more robust you will have no doubt he will point back and say see that 's what i was doing , " said @entity144 , a professor of history and public affairs at @entity147 and @entity1 contributor			1
@entity157 , @entity156 faced similar issues it 's what happened when former president @entity157 , who led the nation at a time when the country was reeling from a tough economy and just starting to get over the @entity165			1
in his second term " there was a sense @entity7 was moving in the right direction in terms of how it was doing around the globe , " @entity144 said			1
when former president @entity156 took office the economy was n't doing well , but by the second term the economy was picking up , allowing him to deliver a balanced budget and ultimate surplus by the end of his presidency			1
" there was clearly a shift in the mood , " @entity144 said			0
" in both cases , the presidents were good at claiming credit for it			0
" mood matters in the age of austerity everyday folks have learned to cut back and suck it up — some after finding themselves underwater on mortgages they could not afford to pay ; others after losing jobs that their companies could no longer afford to keep			0
so , @entity7 have been using their credit cards less and paying down debt more -- household debt as a percentage of disposable personal income is at its lowest rate in almost 30 years , according to the @entity205 and credit card balances had reached their lowest level in more than a decade			1
and many expect the same discipline from their government			0
" @entity7 will be realistic , just as those in government need to be realistic , " @entity32 said of citizens ' likely approach to their own finances over the next four years			1
but , as @entity3 enters his second term , both the housing and job markets have been on a slow and steady uptick			2
housing sales were up 6 % in 2012 -- the biggest gain since 2005 , according to @entity222 -- and the unemployment rate had dropped to 7.8 % in december , although there are still 4.8 million @entity7 -- or 39.1 % of the jobless -- classified as long - term unemployed , according to the @entity226			2
" going into the second term , the fiscal situation will continue the agenda and the discussion , " he said			0
" it will say a lot about us and where not only the government but the nation might be going			2
if it is difficult and , shall we say , fractured and there 's a sense coming out of it that things are not working as they should my guess is that the public will begin saying : ' when will @entity0 work on our behalf ? ' " governing on a deadline that sentiment was foreshadowed in the frustration over the down - to - the - wire , partisan political maneuvering as the last @entity65 sought to avert the fiscal cliff 's steepest domestic spending cuts			2
@entity3 appeared to prevail on that skirmish , delivering on a promise to raise tax rates on wealthy @entity7 -- although he shifted his definition of " wealthy " from those making $ 250,000 or more to those making $ 400,000 and up			1
according to @entity262 and @entity263 polls , @entity7 were none too impressed with how lawmakers handled the negotiations or the deal that was struck			2
some 41 % of those polled disapproved of the deal , according to @entity262 , and 52 % thought the deal would hurt people like them			0
in the @entity263 poll , 67 % - disapproved of congressional @entity103 ' handled the negotiations while 55 % disapproved of how @entity272 performed			0
still , partly due to deliberate redistricting to protect -- or create -- more partisan congressional districts , @entity50 voters continued to elect or re-elect safe representatives to do their bidding in @entity65			0
for instance , most of the 435 members of the @entity280 -- republicans and @entity272 -- faced little real opposition on @entity284 in 2012			0
other battlegrounds : @entity286 , gun control , immigration but the next battle looms			0
just weeks after @entity3 takes his oath of office , a new @entity65 will be tasked with addressing the automatic spending cuts , or sequester , that were kicked down the road in order to pass a smaller deal at the end of the year			2
the new @entity65 will also consider raising the nation 's debt ceiling , or the ability of the @entity300 to borrow money to pay @entity7 's bills			1
most agree that defaulting on the nation 's obligations would be disastrous for @entity7 and the global economy , but some republicans in @entity65 are starting to hint that they may be prepared to let that happen anyway if large spending cuts are not secured			1
and after that , the fight over gun control , a high priority for the @entity108 in the aftermath of the @entity314 school massacre , will pit the president against many members of the @entity96 and @entity318 from safe districts with high ratings and big - dollar donations from gun rights advocates			2
the president and vice president unveiled a major plan on wednesday that included 23 executive actions the president has ordered on his own , while urging the new @entity65 to take on the meaty issues of an assault weapons ban , limits on the number of bullets a gun magazine can hold , and other sweeping reforms the gun lobby and others say would gut the constitutional right to bear arms			2
immigration reform , another @entity108 priority , will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in @entity65			0
for the first time , the @entity343 is dominated by women and racial minorities , while the @entity96 caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men			0
in the @entity318 , 20 women — the largest number in history — currently hold office			0
but women and minorities are far outnumbered and outranked by white males on some of the most powerful congressional committees			0
and despite several high - ranking exceptions , @entity3 's cabinet -- so far -- is shaping up to be largely male and white			1
" the first thing we learned is that we 're not post-race			0
that was a lot of willful imagining in ' 08 that his election would allow us to transcend these questions of race , " said @entity362 , a cultural and black studies professor at @entity363			0
" the @entity50 electorate is looking different in terms of race and ethnicity and young folks being engaged			0
in 2016 our political realities will look more like our demographic realities			0
" and that 's where the nation 's shift over the next four years may be most visible			1
but look first to the 2014 midterms and then the 2016 presidential election to see if the people signal continued frustration with the current regime -- in @entity65 and in the @entity108 -- or demonstrate through the power of their vote that they feel the nation has finally turned the corner .			0

reeling from the *turmoil* of the last four years , the country may be ready to regroup
president @entity3 , adopting a more assertive posture , will need to still *persuade* a divided country to get things done
the economy is improving , the nation 's demographics are shifting and a new @entity7 is emerging
