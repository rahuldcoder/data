-- in normal times , @entity1 is a teeming 14,600 - acre reservoir with a maximum depth of 108 feet , just west of the town of @entity6 , @entity7			1
in normal times , the reservoir serves not only the 1,000 or so people who live in @entity6 , but also @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- cities with a combined population over 230,000			2
but these are not normal times			0
in the past eight months this area has received 1 inch of rain			1
only 3 inches have fallen in the past 12 months , and even though @entity6 is now the reservoir 's only customer , if the rains do n't come , it will be dry by late winter			1
@entity7 is suffering from the third - worst drought in the state 's history , according to state agriculture commissioner @entity23			1
more than 2 million acres of farmland have been abandoned due to the exceptional dryness , he said , and the weather has been " excruciatingly painful " for producers , affecting the harvest of cotton , corn and grain			0
@entity33 teased @entity7 last weekend , making landfall between @entity35 and @entity36 , but it petered out into a tropical depression far , far away from @entity7 and shriveling water sources like @entity39 , some 250 miles west of @entity40			1
photos posted online by @entity0 affiliate kwes in @entity10 showed parts of the reservoir that have been reduced to the basics -- the river that feeds it surrounded by acres of crackled , dried - out lake bed , some of it already being reclaimed by vegetation			0
" i 'll be 65 tomorrow and i 've never seen anything like it , " mayor @entity51 of @entity6 said of the situation			2
the bigger cities , which have other water sources , are no longer allowed to pull from @entity39 , but even with only @entity6 pumping water , if it does n't rain the town can expect to run dry " around the first of the year or march , maybe , " he said			1
the town is down to less than 1 % of its water supply , and residents are under phase 3 drought contingency plan , meaning no outdoor watering at all , he told @entity42			1
already , to try to achieve a 35 % reduction in daily usage , officials are encouraging residents to find multiple uses for bathwater and other spent water			2
right around the corner lies the prospect of rationing , or as @entity51 described it to the tv station , " a pro-rated deal where everyone gets so much water per family member			0
" the only option for getting the water from somewhere other than @entity39 is by pipeline or truck			1
@entity51 said the town still has an emergency plan to lay a 12 - mile pipeline to @entity89 , the nearest water supply , but not a foot of pipe has been laid yet			1
" we 're trying to jump through hoops with the state to get the permits , " he said			0
and , it 's not as though anyone in @entity7 is doing much better			2
" i do n't know where you go to find someone who has excess water , " @entity51 told kwes			0
" we 'd probably use the @entity103 and i have no idea where they would get the water to truck in			0
" @entity109 , to the south , gets its water from the @entity111 , which is drying up , and @entity113 , 32 miles to the south , is down to a two - year supply			2
@entity113 also is home to the nearest operating car wash -- a luxury by @entity6 standards these days , the mayor said			0
" you can see lots of pretty nasty cars around here			0
" @entity0 's @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 contributed to this report .			0

the town of @entity6 , @entity7 , *relies* on @entity39 as its only water source
the area has received only 3 inches of rain in the past 12 months
the town is down to less than 1 % of its water supply , and could be dry by late winter
@entity7 is suffering the third - worst drought in its history
