not too long ago , there were just as many news reports about @entity3 's fancy nightclubs and the @entity6 capital 's embrace of modern living as there were stories about violence			1
@entity6 had maintained relative stability despite the full - tilt civil war that has torn apart its largest neighbor and former military occupier , @entity15 , for more than a year and a half			1
the war has triggered some sectarian conflicts inside @entity6 , and that raised concerns -- but no alarm bells -- about a broader conflict			1
now , that may have changed			0
the trigger came friday , when a car bomb exploded in central @entity3 , killing @entity6 's top intelligence official , @entity26			1
he publicly opposed @entity15 president @entity28			2
many in @entity6 immediately suspected @entity28 's regime in the assassination			1
pockets of sporadic fighting have erupted across the country			0
@entity6 's army made an unprecedented move by issuing a statement demanding that politicians order their supporters to calm down			1
" the country 's fate is at risk , " the statement said			0
" tension in some areas is increasing to unprecedented levels			0
" lawmakers who are most opposed to @entity15 's influence inside @entity6 -- mostly through its @entity6 ally , @entity51 -- are now calling for the government 's resignation			1
@entity6 is a country on the brink			2
and many observers believe that the longer @entity15 's conflict goes on , the more destabilizing it will be for @entity6			1
here 's an overview of where things stand and how they got to this point : why was @entity6 's intelligence chief assassinated last week ? what does that have to do with @entity15 ? on friday , the man who once led investigations into the targeted killings of high - profile @entity6 officials was killed himself in a massive car bomb in @entity70 , the typically peaceful and cosmopolitan district of @entity3 that he called home			1
@entity6 officials said there was no doubt @entity27 was the target of the attack			2
@entity77 : a polarizing figure speculation immediately fell to @entity15 , even though @entity80 and its ally , @entity51 , both condemned the attack			2
@entity6 vowed to hunt down the perpetrators , and the @entity85 dispatched @entity87 agents to help in the investigation			2
@entity77 may have been targeted because he was leading an investigation into a @entity6 politician , @entity90 , who is accused of working with two @entity15 officials to plan attacks inside @entity6			1
how much control does @entity15 have inside @entity6 ? @entity15 ended its military occupation of @entity6 in 2005 , bowing to international pressure after the assassination of former prime minister @entity97			1
yet the country maintains influence through @entity51 , a powerful @entity100 political party that has links with the @entity28 government and currently dominates @entity6 's government			1
@entity51 is also an @entity104 - backed paramilitary group deemed a terrorist organization by the @entity85 , whose agents inside @entity6 were indicted by the @entity108 for @entity97 's assassination			1
elements of @entity6 prime minister @entity112 's alliance are firm , if quiet , supporters of the @entity28 regime			2
but the government is more interested in keeping @entity6 from getting dragged into the conflict , says @entity118 expert @entity117 of @entity119			2
" they 're aware they 're a weak government , and they 're not keen on @entity6 becoming a staging point for the rebels to launch attacks on @entity15 , " @entity117 said			1
" but there has n't been a major drive to push the @entity128 out of the country because the government knows a large segment of the @entity6 population supports the rebels			2
" why do @entity6 support @entity51 , which is considered a terrorist group by the @entity85 ? @entity51 , experts say , is popular inside @entity6 because it has managed to do what the @entity6 government at large has failed to pull off : efficiently provide cradle - to - grave services			0
to the @entity139 , @entity51 is an enemy			0
the @entity85 has long designated it a terrorist organization , blaming it for a series of kidnappings and for setting off truck bombs in 1983 that killed more than 200 @entity85 @entity146 in @entity3			0
@entity51 was also behind the hijacking of a @entity149 flight in 1985 , which produced infamous footage of a pilot leaning out of the cockpit with a gun to his head			0
@entity51 was created in 1982 to oppose @entity156 's occupation of @entity6			2
throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s , it waged violence against its chief target , @entity156 , sparking violence between those nations and , by proxy , fanning the tension among their allies			0
but inside @entity6 , it runs hospitals and schools , provides college counseling and employs traffic cops			0
the group reinforces its message on its own @entity173 satellite television channel and broadcast station			0
that has not stopped it from amassing substantial political power inside @entity6 , according to author and journalist @entity177			0
" they provide in a fair and efficient way , but @entity51 is also authoritarian , power - hungry and militaristic , " said @entity177 , who has reported extensively in the region for the @entity180 and the @entity181			0
" they believe in a religious and pious society that embraces a fundamentalist @entity100			0
they believe in self sufficiency through war			0
" @entity104 and @entity15 support @entity51 's ideology			2
both countries have provided the group , which has a military wing , with financial backing and weapons for years			0
@entity51 also makes millions through illegal businesses around the world , including global drug trafficking , the @entity85 has charged			0
have there been widespread protests in @entity6 ? against what ? protests have been more isolated			0
after @entity27 's funeral sunday , angry protesters clashed with security forces and rushed toward @entity112 's office in central @entity3 , calling for his dismissal			0
the mob hurled sticks , stones and flags			0
a smaller , peaceful demonstration continued later sunday as government figures called for calm			0
most of the protesters are allied with @entity216 coalitions that have long been sharply critical of the @entity6 government 's perceived closeness with the @entity15 regime , blaming @entity220 for not preventing friday 's deadly car bomb			1
why could @entity15 's problems become @entity6 's ? they 're two different countries , after all			1
the major concern for @entity6 is that @entity15 's troubles will reopen the wounds of @entity6 's 15 - year - long civil war , which ended in 1990			1
@entity6 has always struggled to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects , and the current tensions mirror those in @entity15 : in both countries , the @entity100 and @entity233 sects ( @entity28 is an @entity233 ) tend to support the @entity15 regime , while support is growing among @entity216 for @entity15 rebels			1
the country also has a large @entity239 population , and both @entity216 and @entity100 groups have lobbied for @entity239 support during past conflicts			0
@entity216 are in the majority in northern @entity6 , where they have clashed with a small but strong enclave of pro-al - @entity246			0
the core of the @entity15 president 's support in @entity6 is in the southern part of the country			1
the good news is that the war exhaustion factor is very high in @entity6 , @entity117 explained			2
@entity3 is still recovering from @entity156 's shelling of the city in 2006 during a 34 - day conflict sparked by @entity51 's kidnapping of @entity156 troops near the @entity6 border , and many other wounds from the 1975 - 90 civil war have yet to heal			1
" there 's been an assumption for several years that the @entity6 people are fed up and exhausted with civil war , " @entity117 said			1
" the civil war there ended not because of any resolution but simply because people lost the will to keep fighting			1

@entity6 has maintained relative stability despite the civil war raging next door
last week 's assassination of a top intel official may have changed that
@entity15 still plays a major role in @entity6 , despite pulling out its troops in 2005
