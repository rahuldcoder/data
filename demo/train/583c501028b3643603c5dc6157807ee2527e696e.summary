i recently led a bipartisan congressional delegation to the @entity2 and @entity3 to discuss regional security issues with key @entity6 partners			1
beyond the strategic challenges posed by the @entity8 lies an urgent threat -- @entity11 's determination to achieve nuclear weapons capability			1
@entity11 's effort , if successful , could destabilize the @entity2 , spur a regional nuclear arms race and undermine @entity6 's influence in this pivotal region			1
unfortunately , the window to solve this problem without conflict gets smaller with each passing day as @entity11 attempts to master the enrichment of uranium			2
several administrations have tried engaging @entity11 and offering security guarantees , but that has not prevented the country from pursuing the bomb or patronizing the world 's most dangerous terrorist groups			2
economic and diplomatic pressures have n't worked either , but they have been episodic , gradual and largely unilateral			0
while the @entity6 left @entity11 's market years ago , we can still exert great pressure through financial sanctions , and president @entity34 should do so			1
our partners in @entity3 , @entity36 and the @entity2 can and should do more to amplify the effect of @entity6 sanctions if they are serious about stopping @entity11 's nuclear proliferation			1
some influential countries , however , may be unwilling to pay the costs associated with greater multilateral sanctions , either because they do not feel threatened by a nuclear - armed @entity11 or they see utility in having the @entity6 being consumed with that threat			1
in the weeks ahead , it will be actions , not words , that demonstrate which countries are truly committed to stopping @entity11			2
the latest round of @entity3 sanctions is designed to compel @entity11 to come back to the negotiating table			2
if the @entity11 do so , the desire for a deal at any cost should not be permitted to overshadow our long experience in negotiating with rogue states			0
we must focus on the results rather than the process of negotiations			0
with its nuclear centrifuges continuing to spin , @entity11 can not be allowed -- as it has been in the past -- to further delay this process			2
mere promises can not be rewarded with a loosening of pressure			0
@entity11 's leaders must feel dramatic pressure that imperils their very hold on power until their abandonment of nuclear program can be verified			1
it is possible that only a strategy that jeopardizes the hard - line clerics ' hold on power in @entity77 will give the @entity11 regime sufficient reason to abandon its nuclear ambitions			2
frankly , the @entity34 administration missed an opportunity to stand with @entity11 's dissidents when they rose up against their oppressive rulers after the rigged elections in 2009			1
it is hard to believe a less ideological government would be as intransigent as the current regime			0
perhaps further sanctions could breathe new life into the budding democratic movement that for a brief moment brought a glimmer of hope to the @entity11 people			2
in addition to sanctions , we must actively combat @entity11 's influence throughout the @entity2			1
our partners are perplexed at what they perceive as our lackadaisical response to @entity11 's support of extremist proxies			1
and in @entity105 , our partners believe that @entity6 's abandonment of that country has left a vacuum that @entity11 is only too eager to fill			1
it is hard to see why the @entity34 administration has not expended more effort in trying to keep @entity105 -- a potentially rich and influential country at the heart of the @entity2 that was liberated at such great cost -- more firmly in the @entity6 camp			2
finally , there is the low - hanging fruit of @entity117			0
@entity119 's regime may be @entity11 's most important strategic partner			1
instead of aggressively combating @entity117 's support to @entity122 and @entity123 and interference in @entity125 and @entity105 , the @entity34 administration came to office seeking to engage @entity119			0
now the president has finally acknowledged that it 's time for @entity119 to go			0
@entity6 should not defer to obstinate @entity130 diplomats at the @entity131 about @entity117			0
instead , we should lead an international effort to apply tremendous pressure on @entity117 and provide demonstrable support to its growing political opposition			0
the longer the @entity117 crackdown is allowed to continue , the greater the risk of chaos and the harder it will be to put @entity117 back together			0
if @entity117 goes down , it would be a serious blow to the @entity11 regime			0
there is no substitute for @entity6 leadership in the @entity2			1
it is time for the @entity34 administration to show it			0
without recourse to war , these steps represent the best hope of confronting the challenges posed by @entity11 's nuclear proliferation and patronage of terrorism			1
if these measures ultimately fail , the international community may be forced to confront the difficult decision of using military force in face of an implacable @entity11			0
follow @entity162 on @entity163 join the conversation on @entity165			0

@entity167 : @entity11 's determination for nuclear weapons capability is an urgent threat
@entity167 : we can exert stronger pressure on @entity11 through financial sanctions
he says we should combat @entity11 influence throughout the @entity2
there 's no substitute for @entity6 leadership in this *critical* region , he says
