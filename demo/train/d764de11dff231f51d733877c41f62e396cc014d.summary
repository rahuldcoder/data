-- a controversial bill that would extend the right to request euthanasia to children suffering terminal illnesses and adults with dementia cleared a vote in a @entity11 @entity10 committee wednesday			1
the panel voted 13 - 4 to allow minors to seek euthanasia under certain conditions , the communications director for the @entity10 , @entity12 , told @entity0			1
the vote is one stage in a legislative process -- the bill must clear other hurdles before it becomes law			1
@entity11 passed legislation in 2002 allowing voluntary euthanasia for adults			1
changes to the law now being considered by lawmakers would allow under - 18s to request an end to their life only under stringent guidelines			1
dr. @entity32 , who is part of the end - of - life research group at @entity36 ' @entity35 , specializing in the impact of legalized euthanasia , said the bill explicitly states that it would be possible only for competent minors suffering unbearable physical pain from a serious physical illness without prospect of improvement to request euthanasia			1
this is different from adults , who can also request it if they are suffering psychologically			2
@entity32 argues the debate in @entity11 is more one of principle than anything else -- that very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them			1
the bill will now be introduced in the @entity10 , where it will be debated in a plenary meeting by all senators , @entity57 said			1
if the bill is voted against , this would mean the end of the measure			0
if it passes , the bill would then be transferred to the @entity65 for debate			0
if approved there , it would go to the king to be signed into law			0
' @entity71 ' earlier this month , 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice			0
among them was @entity78 , also from @entity36 ' @entity35			0
" doctors do terminate lives of children as well as adults , " he told @entity0			2
" but today it 's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it 's illegal			0
and this means that there 's a lot of room to do things the wrong way			0
" dr. @entity92 , director of pro-euthanasia group @entity93 , told @entity0 the @entity11 are to be applauded for their progressive thinking on a very difficult issue			2
however , critics question whether children are capable of making an informed decision on whether to end their own lives			0
the @entity101 already allows children over the age of 12 to request euthanasia with the consent of their parents			1
since the law was introduced in 2002 , only five children have chosen to die that way			2
