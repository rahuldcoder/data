-- a young woman stands against a crisp black backdrop			2
the photographer walks forward and gently turns her away from the camera			1
today the focus is not on her face but on the delicate architectural feat that sits atop her head			2
it seems to almost defy gravity , with light radiating from the hair tower as it spirals upwards in a conical shape			2
hairstyles have long been popular fashion statements for @entity18 women			1
but over the years , the intricate braiding and eye - catching sculptures have often reflected the country 's changing sociopolitical times as well			1
and for the last six decades , one man made it his life 's work to capture the complex refashioning of his homeland			1
in february , the renowned artist @entity29 died at his home in @entity31 aged 84			1
he left behind a remarkable body of work , much of which is largely unknown outside @entity35			1
but now , many of @entity29 's countrymen are putting in a renewed effort to celebrate the life of the beloved artist -- through documentary films , exhibitions and an impressive monograph of work , @entity35 is presenting @entity29 to the world one last time			1
" he started taking images of a nation that was in the throes of development [ and ] independence in 1960 , " explains @entity46 , the founder and director of the @entity48 , @entity31			1
" we discovered oil , money ... modern buildings were going up			2
so he documented that process , that transition into a modernizing nation			2
" a final wish for a departed friend over the last five years , @entity46 has been working tirelessly to complete an extensive monograph on @entity29			1
this has not been yet another project for the art curator -- @entity29 was a close friend , and the duo had been collaborating on the monograph up until his untimely passing in february			1
" i had a very close relationship with ' @entity74 , ' as we call him here , " says @entity46 , who turned to crowdfunding platform @entity69 to raise funds for publishing the book			2
" i used to speak to him at least once a week			0
" @entity46 recalls @entity29 's passion and enthusiasm for the project and , holding it close to her heart , she says she 's determined to finish what they had started together			1
" he was really dynamic , really passionate about photography and there was so much to learn in his archive			0
over the last five years , we became friends			0
he was like a father to me			0
" it was just such a big shock that he passed away			2
that he would n't see the book he was extremely excited about			0
" documenting independence born in a small rural village in @entity35 in 1930 , @entity29 would become one of @entity35 's most celebrated artists			1
for over 60 years , the master photographer fastidiously immersed himself in capturing his homeland , documenting every facet of daily life			1
his many photographs would come together to create a striking anthropological study of @entity35			0
the 1950s saw a young @entity29 searching for a vocation			1
rejected by the army , it was an uncle who inadvertently put him on a lifelong journey by suggesting photography			0
starting small , the untrained amateur would photograph women in his village as they donned their sunday best and headed to church			0
later on , @entity29 got a job as a darkroom assistant at the @entity18 @entity115			1
when he was n't working , he was often found at the local university , snapping moments between students , staff and events on campus -- once again capturing daily life on film			2
the country was moving toward a time of social change and political upheaval and @entity29 explored this through his lens			1
" you 're getting a sort of history of @entity35 at a very important , transitional period , just on the cusp of independence , " says @entity46			0
" and just after independence [ in 1960 ] , when there is a feeling of euphoria , feeling of liberation , the sense of ' now we can conquer the world , we can develop the nation ; we are free , we are independent			2
' " and this all comes out in the way in which individuals and people presented themselves			0
it 's like : ' look at me			0
i 'm fashionable , i 'm modern , i 'm confident , i 'm educated			0
' all these images amount to a visual image of @entity35 in the 50s , 60s and 70s			0
" not just hair @entity29 's next job was working for the national television station , a career move that enabled him to rub shoulders with other creative minds			1
this is when he started to take photographs with more artistic intent , explains @entity46			0
" he started coming into contact other artists , filmmakers , writers and that 's why as he developed , the artistic intent as opposed to the anthropological intent began to develop			0
when we finally get to ' hairstyles , ' they are actually done in a very specific manner			0
it was n't someone on the street			0
it was in a studio with a specific lighting , with a specific position			0
" the " hairstyles " series , for which he is so critically acclaimed , features over 1,000 photographs of @entity18 styles since 1954			1
but for @entity46 , his work documenting traditional @entity18 headgear and the country 's architecture , as well as his studio portrait work , must be examined alongside " hairstyles " to fully comprehend @entity29 's legacy			1
the images communicate a transition from the normal photographs depicting @entity195 , says @entity46			0
" the images we are used to seeing of @entity195 -- they gave a one dimensional perspective of a race , of a nation , of a people			2
it 's been a herculean work to bring this publication together			2
" final tributes @entity46 's monograph is just one tribute to @entity29			1
@entity18 filmmaker @entity208 recently released " @entity29 : master photographer , " a documentary capturing the final year of the artist 's life			1
elsewhere , an exhibition of " hairstyles " is currently shown across the @entity215			0
curated by @entity217 , it is the first time audiences in the country are having the chance to view @entity35 from this perspective			0
" as a @entity18 , he wanted to document that moment in @entity35 when it was a time of colonial rule changing over to democracy , " says @entity217			1
" he was keen in the wake of modernization to capture something that was quite intrinsic to his culture , his nation and he saw the rate of change that was happening and he thought hairstyles were fascinating and an art form in their own right , " she continues			2
" they were something that should be preserved because the thing about a hairstyle is that they are really ephemeral			0
" she adds : " i think it was a love letter to his country			0
he used photography which is a very modern medium to document these moments of social change			0
