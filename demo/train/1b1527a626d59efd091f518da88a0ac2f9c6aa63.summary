-- deep in @entity4 's @entity3 desert is an abandoned settlement , part submerged by the sand , somehow alien , yet strangely familiar			1
the surrounding landscape looks like it 's from another world , in a galaxy far , far away -- which is why movie director @entity11 chose it as a location for filming parts of his blockbuster " @entity17 " series			1
the @entity3 was transformed into @entity18 -- the barren planet with twin suns that was the birthplace of @entity22 , otherwise known as @entity22			2
