-- the parents of a 15 - year - old @entity3 high school student who committed suicide after being bullied by her classmates received a nearly quarter - million - dollar settlement , according to documents made public after a months - long attempt to uncover details of the agreement			1
the settlement was reached with the town of @entity12 in november of 2010 , but it was only made public tuesday after a reporter successfully sued to gain access to the records			1
the reporter , @entity17 from @entity18 , filed the public records lawsuit on december 2 with assistance from the @entity21 , after first requesting the documents in may			2
superior court judge @entity22 on friday ordered the settlement be made public , adding that @entity17 " demonstrated that she , in her role as a news reporter , and the public have a @entity28 right to access the information contained in these settlement documents			1
" the agreement centers around the case of @entity35 , whose body was found last year hanging in the stairway leading to her family 's second - floor apartment			2
on the day she died , @entity40 had endured a torrent of verbal abuse that began at the school library and continued as she walked home from school in tears , according to prosecutors			0
her parents , @entity52 and @entity40 , received the $ 225,000 settlement sum after filing a complaint with the state 's @entity55 in 2010 , arguing that @entity57 failed to address hazing that preceded their daughter 's death			1
the settlement prohibits @entity40 's parents from again suing the town over @entity40 's suicide , but it also binds them to a confidentiality agreement that prevents publicizing details of the agreement			1
in a letter written to the @entity18 reporter on may 9 , town officials pointed to a confidentiality clause in the agreement as reason for keeping the record sealed			0
" i did not want to violate the trust of the people who entered into it with that confidentiality clause in it , " town counsel @entity75 told @entity0			0
civil rights advocacy groups have since hailed friday 's decision			0
" a public document does not become private because the government inserts a confidentiality clause or a nondisclosure clause , " said @entity83			0
according to the court order , public records are defined as " all books , papers , maps , photographs , recorded tapes , financial statements " and other items " made or received by any officer or employee of any agency			0
