-- i 'll never forget watching lady @entity2 tie the knot with @entity4 , the @entity5 , on july 29 , 1981			1
like most women in the western world , i 'd been obsessed with " the @entity8 " since the shocking announcement that @entity4 was finally giving up his single status at the fairly old age of 32 , to marry the adorable 20 - year - old @entity2			1
i was as na√Øve as the poor unsuspecting @entity2 and had no idea that this was n't a real fairy tale romance			1
i breathlessly read the stories about how the pair had met through her older sister , @entity17 , whom @entity4 had once dated ! and i closely followed the endless speculation about who would design @entity2 's dress			1
if you think that the media and the public have gone hog wild over prince @entity26 ' wedding to @entity27 , you 'd be surprised by how we were whipped into even more of a royal frenzy by the @entity2 and @entity4 nuptials			1
watch the royal wedding and share it with @entity32 after all , @entity33 and @entity27 have dated for eight years , whereas @entity4 was linked to a series of blue - blooded types and then , suddenly , was marrying an adorable kindergarten teacher who had also worked as a nanny			1
@entity2 may have been the daughter of the 8th @entity38 , but she was also the first relatable royal			1
@entity2 was just like us ! she was shy and pretty but not beautiful , and she was caught by photographers wearing a skirt that turned sheer in the sunlight			1
she 'd suffered a wardrobe malfunction that we could all sympathize with			2
so of course , i had to be one of the 750 million people out of bed on the big wedding day , watching the royal procession to @entity52 in @entity53			2
in fact , my husband and i honored the occasion by gathering for a 6 a.m. tea party around my friend @entity59 , along with several other of our friends			0
while we watched @entity2 ride in a beautiful traditional carriage to @entity52 's , we munched on scones and clotted cream , and drank endless cups of tea			1
the guys all wore bow ties and top hats			0
my girlfriends and i turned out in old prom dresses and white gloves			0
hey , we wanted to get fully into the wedding spirit			0
when @entity2 stepped out of her carriage , our mouths dropped at the sight of her stunning ivory silk taffeta and lace dress designed by the husband - and - wife design team , @entity81 and @entity82			1
the unusual design of @entity2 's dress , with its ruffled v - neck neckline , stunned us			1
it was unlike anything we 'd ever seen -- extravagant but but modest , with its big puffed sleeves and full skirt			0
and as romantic as it was , @entity2 herself with her adorable shaggy haircut looked perfectly modern			1
no one expected a bride to be sexy in those days , like many brides today -- especially celebrity brides			0
i hope @entity27 resists the temptation to go sexy or body conscious when she weds @entity33			0
hopefully , the reason she is dieting down to next - to - nothing now is n't because her gown is form - fitting			0
when i watched @entity2 wed @entity4 , i never imagined that i would get to meet her twice , in the coming years			1
the first occasion was when @entity2 hosted a party honoring @entity104 designers at @entity105 in @entity106 , 1987			1
at the time , i was editor - in - chief of @entity106 , @entity107 's fashion magazine			0
@entity2 greeted all of us in a reception line , with 5 - year - old prince @entity33 by her side			2
little @entity33 looked thrilled to be standing next to his beautiful mommy in formal shorts and a white shirt , shaking everyone 's hand			0
when it was my turn to take @entity2 's hand , i complimented her on what a wonderful job she was doing as @entity121 , and she smiled , looked directly into my eyes and murmured that her husband was a wonderful teacher			2
she seemed completely genuine and still very much in love with @entity4			2
she was also charismatic and even more stunning up close , in person , than in pictures			0
she made me feel like she was thrilled to meet me			0
she had the same effect when i met her again at the @entity129 awards in january 1995 , in @entity130			0
@entity2 had come to present her good friend @entity131 , then editor - in - chief of @entity134 magazine , with an award for editorial achievement			2
@entity2 was stunning , and you could see her toned arms in a sleek navy gown			1
when we were introduced , she seemed completely engrossed when we chatted for a few minutes about how competitive the fashion magazine world was			0
i was the editor - in - chief of @entity143 then , and @entity2 had the same effect on me as she had the first time we met -- she was far more beautiful in person than in photos			2
everything about her -- from her skin and her eyes to her handshake and conversation -- emanated warmth			0
with a mother like that , it 's no wonder @entity33 wanted to marry @entity27 , a woman he knows through and through , and with whom he has an obviously warm and loving relationship			0
having met @entity2 , i have no doubt she would have made @entity27 , her soon - to - be daughter - in - law , feel like her bff from the moment @entity33 brought her home			2
if @entity2 were here friday , she 'd be beaming to the @entity164 rafters			1
there 's no doubt in my mind that she 's beaming in heaven !			0

@entity170 : the media and the public went hog wild over the @entity2 and @entity4 nuptials
she says that after the wedding , she she got to meet @entity2 twice
@entity2 was stunning , and you could see her toned arms in a sleek navy gown , @entity170 says
she says if @entity2 were here friday , she 'd be beaming to the @entity164 rafters
