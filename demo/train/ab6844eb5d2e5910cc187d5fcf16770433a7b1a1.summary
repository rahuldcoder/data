@entity2 body scanners that produce graphic images of travelers ' bodies will be removed from checkpoints by june , the @entity0 says , ending what critics called " virtual strip searches			1
" passengers will continue to pass through machines that display a generic outline of the human body , raising fewer privacy concerns			1
the @entity0 move came after @entity16 , the manufacturer of the 174 so - called " backscatter " machines , acknowledged it could not meet a congressional - ordered deadline to install privacy software on the machines			1
" it is big news , " said @entity23 , executive director of the @entity24			0
" it removes the concern that people are being viewed naked by the @entity0 screener			2
" in 2004 and 2005 , the @entity0 at first dismissed privacy concerns , then sought to address them by placing @entity0 officers viewing the scanner imagery in remote locations , away from the passenger being screened			1
they also gave passengers the right to an alternative screening -- a pat down			0
speedier trip through airport security could come within a decade but those solutions failed to appease privacy groups and some members of @entity45 , who felt both alternatives could be abused			0
ultimately , a problem caused by technology was solved by technology			0
security companies developed privacy software , called @entity52 ( @entity54 ) software			1
but while manufacturers of the less - intrusive " millimeter wave " machines found ways to use @entity54 software , backscatter machines have not			2
this week , the @entity0 announced it is ending its contract with @entity16 " due to its inability to deploy non-imaging @entity54 software			1
" how much do we really hate the @entity0 ? " by june 2013 travelers will only see machines which have @entity54 that allow for faster throughput			1
this means faster lanes for the traveler and enhanced security , " the @entity0 said in a statement			0
the @entity0 could allow backscatter machines in the future if the company develops the required software , the @entity0 said			1
currently , the @entity0 uses the 174 backscatter machines in 30 airports , and has another 76 units in storage			2
it uses millimeter wave machines in 170 airports			0
the decision to remove the backscatter machine will make moot , at least temporarily , travelers ' concerns about the health effects of the machines			0
backscatter machines use x-rays , while millimeter wave machines use radio waves			0
the @entity0 has long maintained both machines are safe , but recently signed an agreement with the @entity96 to study the scanners			2
the study will continue even though the machines are being pulled , the @entity0 said , because they could be reintroduced in the future			2
