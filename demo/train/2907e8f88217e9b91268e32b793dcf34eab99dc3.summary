-- sometimes it 's hard to know what to believe about @entity3			1
his two years in @entity5 with @entity6 were packed with reports of his eccentric behaviour , from setting his bathroom alight with fireworks ( before being named a fire safety spokesman ) to a training brawl with his club manager , giving money away to strangers ... the list was endless			0
and now @entity19 sports paper @entity17 has reported firstly , on friday , that the soccer star has been named as one of @entity23 's 100 most influential people of 2012 ( though there is no evidence of that on the magazine 's website ) and then , on the way to a game on sunday , he was caught smoking in the toilet of a train , which will cost him a fine			2
what is certain is that @entity3 , who appeared on the cover of @entity23 last november , will miss a crucial game next weekend that will have a major impact on his club @entity39 's hopes of automatically qualifying for next season 's @entity41			1
the 22 - year - old was booked in third - placed @entity39 's 2 - 2 draw with fellow @entity46 hopefuls @entity45 , for trying to delay an opposition free - kick with 20 minutes to play			1
the fourth - placed home side -- at that point 2 - 1 down and playing with 10 men since before halftime after @entity52 was sent off for elbowing @entity3 's strike partner @entity53 -- fought back to equalize through a late penalty by @entity55			1
it was @entity45 's second spot - kick , with @entity58 having reduced the deficit on 66 after goals from midfielders @entity62 and @entity63 had put @entity39 in charge			1
the result left @entity39 13 points behind leaders @entity68 and four adrift of next weekend 's opponent @entity70 -- who beat lowly @entity71 2 - 0 later sunday despite a second - half penalty miss by @entity73			1
the top two teams will automatically qualify for the group stage of @entity23 's top club competition , in which @entity39 lost in the last 16 to @entity77 this season , while the third must play in the final qualifying round			0
" considering the score after the first half , it 's a big slip - up for us , " @entity39 assistant coach @entity81 said on the club 's website			2
" a win would have cut @entity45 out of the @entity41 race as they would have been nine points off			0
@entity3 will be suspended now against @entity70 and @entity91 will play			2
he now has another full week to improve his condition			0
" @entity91 has been struggling with injury since the march 8 win over @entity71 , but came off the bench late in the game against @entity45			0
@entity45 could lose fourth place if @entity98 win monday 's @entity100 derby -- a result which would further dent @entity103 's @entity46 hopes			2
sixth - placed @entity103 suffered a shock 4 - 3 defeat at home to @entity107 , whose veteran @entity109 striker @entity108 scored a second - half hat - trick to outshine @entity112 's double			0
in @entity116 , @entity114 's poor second half to the season continued with a 0 - 0 draw at @entity118 in which the third - placed team had @entity120 and @entity121 sent off			1
it left @entity114 three points behind city rivals @entity124 , and 17 behind leaders @entity77			0
@entity126 moved up to fifth with a 2 - 1 victory at home to 10 - man @entity129 to be two points behind @entity132 , holders of the last @entity41 spot			1
@entity135 headed an injury - time winner after @entity137 leveled , with @entity138 having been sent off in the 56th minute for fouling @entity126 striker @entity139 -- whose resulting penalty was saved			0

@entity3 will miss @entity39 's crucial match against @entity19 rivals @entity70
striker was booked during sunday 's 2 - 2 draw with 10 - man @entity45
result leaves @entity39 four points behind second - placed @entity70
in @entity116 , third - placed @entity114 draw at @entity118 after having two men sent off
