@entity2 @entity4 has been meeting with advisers at her @entity6 , @entity7 home for strategy sessions about launching a 2016 presidential run , a @entity1 source tells @entity3			1
the meetings have taken place for part of the last month , according to the source , and have focused on the strategy , tactics and policy that would make a possible @entity18 run in 2016 campaign successful			1
" she has got a lot of depth in policy , but she is looking for new ideas , " the source said			0
" she is also being very thorough about the path to the nomination and the path to the presidency			0
there are a lot of strategy meetings with tactics focused on that			0
" democrats attending some of these meetings -- which were first reported by the @entity35 on tuesday -- include @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , according to the source , who noted that all three operatives had been selected to play major roles in the @entity18 campaign			1
in the run up to what is now an all - but - certain 2016 announcement , @entity36 has been tapped chief strategist for the @entity18 campaign , according to reports from the @entity35 and @entity48			1
the source said that specific title has not been solidified yet , but the @entity1 pollster is playing a big role in this pre-campaign process			0
" she [ @entity18 ] likes him for more than just reading poll results , " the source said , noting that he would play a larger role than campaign pollster			1
the @entity18 pre-campaign has also selected @entity58 -- a veteran of @entity18 's 2008 campaign -- as their campaign manger , according to the source , and @entity37 -- a senior adviser to @entity64 's successful 2012 reelection bid -- as media adviser			1
both selections have been expected by @entity1 close to @entity18 and been previously reported			2
@entity67 , a top @entity68 adviser who is slated to leave the @entity68 in early february , has also been named campaign chairman , the source said			1
@entity48 was first to report his top campaign slot			1
" he will be the chairman and the issue right now is if everyone will report to him as the chairman , " the source said			0
" i do n't think he will be a titular head			0
i think the issue is is he going to be in charge of the campaign with authority and the intention is that he will be very active			0
" @entity67 , a former top aide in @entity18 's @entity68 , joined the @entity64 @entity68 in 2013 to help on major projects and negotiations			1
recently he has since been blunt about the fact he planned to leave the administration in early 2015 to help a possible @entity18 campaign			2
" if she runs , as i hope she will , i will do whatever she asks me to do , " @entity67 said on the @entity87 in november			2
" right now she has n't made a decision to run , so i am expecting to return to what i was doing before			0
" @entity18 's meetings at her home in @entity7 seemingly explain her month long absence from the speaking circuit and @entity96			1
the former secretary of state has gone over a month without a high - profile speaking gig , a dearth in events that is noticeable considering how many event @entity18 headlined last year			2
@entity18 will headline her first event in over a month on wednesday in @entity103 , @entity104			0
although some structural decisions have been made , the source said the @entity18 camp has not solidified the overall architecture of the operation as well as heads of the communications , field and digital operations			1
" there are these structural things to do and then , really i think once that is done , the thing she is going to end up spending a lot of time on is her plan and her message , " the source said			0
@entity18 's 2016 team , though early , is already shaping up to be a departure from the team that surrounded her in her during her failed 2008 presidential run			1
instead , @entity18 is pulling heavily from @entity1 who successfully won @entity64 the @entity68 twice			0
republicans seeking to tie @entity18 and @entity64 have welcomed that fact , arguing that by hiring former @entity64 advisers , @entity18 is making their job easy			2
in a memo from @entity135 , an @entity136 , @entity137 , the group 's executive director , said " @entity18 is signaling that she 's not just from the same party as the president , but that she 's an @entity64 @entity142 , who will back his policies , pursue his agenda , and represent a third term of the @entity146			2
" emails to the a @entity18 spokesman about the meetings and hiring went unanswered .			0

@entity4 is preparing for a likely 2016 run by *regularly* meeting with advisers in her @entity7 home
@entity18 's orbit has tapped @entity67 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 for top campaign roles
yet to be decided are the structure and heads of @entity18 's communications , field and digital operations
