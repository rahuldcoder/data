an onslaught of fast - falling snow , whipping winds and bitter cold socked parts of the @entity5 on thursday , spurring a slew of travel woes , highway closures and worries that the headaches will only get worse as temperatures fall further			1
this kind of weather , this time of year , in this region is nothing new : @entity18 's governor , for instance , noted the snow totals wo n't come close to the 40 inches that buried parts of his state last february			1
at the same time , by thursday night , it was already causing a mess -- whether you were waiting at an airport , had skidded off a road or were stuck at home hoping that your lights and perhaps your heat would n't suddenly stop working			2
" @entity34 has come to wish us happy new year , " @entity33 gov. @entity32 said			1
the nor'easter , forming off the @entity37 of the @entity38 , prompted blizzard warnings from thursday into friday for @entity33 's @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity43 ' @entity42 and @entity44 , plus communities along @entity47 's coast			1
@entity49 , for example , was already getting buried by snow late thursday afternoon			1
about one - third of the nation , approximately 100 million people in 22 states , was in the path of the storm , which was expected to be at its fiercest between 8 p.m. thursday and 10 a.m. friday , according to @entity58 meteorologist @entity57			1
track the storm : radar , temperatures the complicated storm system " will raise havoc " this week , dumping a foot of snow and spreading subzero wind chills across parts of the region , the @entity62 warned			1
" falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely , " the @entity62 said			2
" this will lead to whiteout conditions making travel extremely dangerous			0
" across the country , the nasty weather has snarled travel plans for many			0
more than 2,200 @entity38 flights had been canceled as of 10:45 p.m. thursday , reported @entity79 , which tracks cancellations due to weather and mechanical problems			1
it 's not like things will suddenly clear up : the same website reports that some 1,000 flights already have been canceled in advance for friday			1
thursday 's most affected airport was @entity89 's @entity88 , with more than 650 cancellations in and out and about the same number of delays			1
@entity94 's @entity93 , @entity33 's @entity95 and @entity97 's @entity96 also were affected			1
many airlines are allowing passengers to make fee - free itinerary changes for destinations expected to be affected by winter storms			0
@entity103 , @entity38 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity107 / @entity106 and @entity108 have all posted weather advisories on their websites			1
inside some airports , would - have - been travelers scrambled to rearrange flights or find a place to stay knowing that some things were out of their control			2
" the warning has been coming for a couple of days , so we expected it , " a man from @entity118 said from @entity49 's @entity119 , as he headed with his family to a hotel and , hopefully , a @entity123 game knowing they could n't fly , reported @entity58 affiliate @entity125			2
" we are stuck , we 'll make the best of it			0
" @entity132 is luckily home in @entity134 , @entity18 , having ventured out into the snow earlier			2
a @entity137 winter veteran , she 's taking it in stride -- " this is nothing " -- if not the possibility of strong winds and power outages , particularly after being in the dark for nine days after last winter 's storm			2
" once the winds start going and the branches start snapping , then i get a little nervous , " @entity132 said			0
here 's a breakdown of what to expect where : @entity33 and @entity40 as of thursday night , @entity33 was under a winter storm warning , as were many other densely populated areas in seven other states			1
the city of 8 million people could get 9 inches of snow , subzero wind chills and turbulent winds , forecasters said			1
@entity33 is expecting to see 6 to 12 inches of snow overnight , with more possible on @entity40 , where @entity162 and @entity163 counties will be under a blizzard warning until 1 p.m. friday , with predictions of 8 to 10 inches of snow , wind chills as low as 10 below zero and sustained winds of at least 35 mph			1
bitter cold will follow , with temperatures in the single digits by saturday morning			2
@entity172 , the capital city of @entity174 could get buried under 14 inches of snow , with wind chills of 15 to 25 below zero , the @entity62 said			1
@entity32 declared a state of emergency for all of @entity33 shortly after 3:45 p.m. thursday , one of several steps taken to try to minimize the wild wintry weather 's toll			1
among them is shutting down parts of @entity184 , an east - west highway that goes from @entity18 to @entity185 , to commercial vehicles late thursday afternoon , with nearby @entity188 south of @entity174 closing at midnight			1
that 's the same time the @entity190 -- in a different part of the state -- will close to traffic at the border between @entity162 and the @entity196 borough of @entity33			1
the hope is to reopen all these roads around 5 a.m. , though that timing is very much subject to change			0
" we 'll make sure no one is in a state of danger on those roads , " said @entity32			0
@entity43 by friday night , @entity49 is expected to be covered by 10 to 18 inches of snow , about twice the amount forecast just one day ago , and shivering in temperatures as low as 6 degrees below zero			1
citing likely " near blizzard " conditions thursday night into late friday morning , the state 's emergency management agency warned that some areas could be hit hard -- including up to two feet of snow on parts of the @entity216 and @entity217 , as well as @entity41 the forecast was so bad for @entity49 that the city canceled school for friday two days in advance , with scores of other school districts quickly following suit			1
" i guess @entity34 wanted to give me one more gift , " mayor @entity225 told reporters thursday in one of his last days in the job he has held since 1993			2
" take precautions and take public transportation and take care of one another , " he urged			0
but , he added , the city was doing its part , with 700 pieces of equipment on city streets			0
" our team is ready , " he said			0
the combination of extreme cold , snow and strong winds had officials at homeless shelters preparing			2
" our main emphasis is getting people inside , where it is safer and warmer , " said @entity246 , a spokeswoman for the @entity248 shelter system in @entity49 , where a snow emergency has been declared			2
" @entity254 is making sure to have extra staff and food and water			0
we are geared up to provide to a greater number of people			0
" blizzard warnings have n't been issued for @entity49 itself , but are in effect for parts of nearby @entity265 and @entity266 counties -- including the communities of @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity266 -- as well as the @entity41			1
because of the storm , the @entity270 warned that the midnight and friday midday high tides could produce " significant flooding " along the coast			1
to this point , the towns of @entity276 and @entity277 requested voluntary evacuations for residents of certain low - lying areas			0
@entity18 wind chills in parts of @entity18 are expected to range from -5 to -20 degrees thursday night and friday ; the @entity62 issued winter storm warnings for most of the state through friday morning			1
@entity18 gov. @entity286 urged residents to take it slow and give themselves extra time for their commutes thursday and friday			1
he said he expects there will be delays , but not cancellations , in public transit			0
addressing reporters , @entity295 said the worst time for the state would be overnight -- between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. , when there could be blizzard conditions			0
still , the storm 's impact could linger well beyond that if roads are blocked or the electricity goes out			0
he acknowledged that this kind of weather is hardly unprecedented in @entity18 this time of year			0
still , the governor added , what sets this system apart is the frigid temperatures forecast for the coming days			1
that 's a big concern throughout the region , especially for the homeless and people stranded -- whether along a road or inside without adequate heat or power -- by the bad weather			1
" ( this ) is not a big @entity137 storm , but it is a particularly cold @entity137 storm , " @entity295 said			0
@entity89 and points beyond seven to 11 inches of snow were possible thursday in @entity89 , according to the @entity62			1
@entity89 residents will feel frigid temps -- wind chills during the day friday will creep down to minus 12 -- and emergency director @entity329 said more snow is possible later in the week			1
though snow in @entity89 in the winter is a common event , it " can still wreak havoc on daily routines , " he noted			0
next week could be no better for some @entity38 residents			2
a new shot of colder air will start to move into the northern @entity339 by saturday and will dive south monday and tuesday , carrying zero - degree cold as far south as @entity340			0
" that 's the coldest air we 've seen that far south in several years , " said @entity57 , the @entity58 meteorologist			0
the cold air will kick off a new storm sunday into monday that could affect a number of high - profile @entity348 playoff games this weekend			0
in @entity350 , the @entity349 will give a cold welcome to the @entity352 on sunday , when temperatures could bottom out at -17			0
but it will be relatively balmy sunday in @entity355 , where snow and rain are possible when the city 's @entity358 host the @entity360 in another @entity348 playoff matchup			2
of course , while the players might not have a choice , fans do n't have to brave the cold for either game			0
the big worries are for those who travel in the coming days			0
authorities in @entity33 , for example , said they may shut the @entity190 if whiteout conditions make driving along the east - west highway too perilous			2
@entity373 is n't taking any chances , nor is he predicting a world - ending storm			0
the @entity33 said he plans to sit tight and let @entity34 do her thing			2
" there 's not much you can do , " @entity373 said			0
" when it 's snowing and these streets lock up , there 's really nowhere you can go , so it 's best to just stay in			0
" that sentiment was echoed by @entity387 , who told @entity389 affiliate @entity388 that he is looking forward to creating some art in the comforts of home			0
" this a great day to kind of hunker down , " @entity387 said .			0
