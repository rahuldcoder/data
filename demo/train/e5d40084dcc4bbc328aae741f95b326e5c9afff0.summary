-- the last time you went to the doctor 's office , you probably got some numbers representing your pulse , blood pressure , maybe even cholesterol and weight			2
but what does that really mean for you ? @entity10 , founder of @entity11 , wants you to be able to see the processes that are making you as healthy or as sick as you are and act on that knowledge			2
@entity14 has detailed , colorful libraries that visualize aspects of sickness and health based on real medical data , and it is now presenting a new tool for breaking bad habits in 2012			1
the new program , which launched this week , is called " the 9 @entity23			1
" each rule is accompanied by a slew of videos , visualizations and interactive graphics			1
more components of wellness rules will be rolled out every monday over the next several months until april 9			1
" if i could see inside myself the healing , and i could see the progress of it , that is inspiring , and that would keep you on the path of following your pathway back to health , " @entity10 said			2
" that 's where i think the power of visualization stands			2
" @entity10 developed the wellness rules program in collaboration with mind - body healing guru dr. @entity46			2
" when you add a story to data , you give it soul , " @entity46 said in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" [ we ] worked together to see how we can inspire people to take charge of their well being and feel emotionally committed to it			2
this is the future of well being			2
" @entity14 aims to have companies sponsor all of the rules			1
the rule 's sponsor is @entity65			1
the first rule is called @entity67			1
that means knowing where you are in terms of measures like blood pressure , pulse , weight , blood counts and cholesterol levels			2
when these indicators are out of whack , they can lead to poor health			2
to understand what these tests at the doctor 's office measure , you can look through the @entity86 , which shows you visually what these measurements mean to your body			2
the library explains what value ranges mean and what problems may stem from abnormal values			2
besides detailed graphics and videos , the site features chapters on things like how to keep your blood pressure healthy -- manage your stress , lose weight , get enough sleep and do n't smoke			1
subsequent wellness rules are meant to help define your wellness mission , develop and maintain nutritional balance , get aerobic and anaerobic exercise , avoid smoking , take a moderate approach , make sleep a priority , manage your stress and embrace joy			1
the website also will launch a personal health record feature , where you can keep track of your own health indicators and create a sort of health narrative of your life , @entity10 said			1
there are generally four types of people who will use the 9 rules of @entity124 , @entity10 said : there 's the great athlete who wants to get in even better shape			1
there 's the person who 's well and wants to stay that way			2
there 's the person who already has high cholesterol , or needs a stent or has to take control of health in order to not get worse			2
and then there 's the person who has had chemotherapy or a severe surgery and needs to get on a wellness program in a specific way			0
breaking bad habits is one fundamental goal of the program			0
@entity10 remembers he used to go home and run every evening , but after starting a family and a company , the pressures of being a good husband , father , pet owner and boss turned that run into a glass of wine			1
then a second glass of wine , and a third			0
it turned into 10 pounds within a couple of years			0
his brain became accustomed to having that wine , to the point where the day was not complete without it			0
" one of the problems is that we have now demanded too much of wellness , " @entity10 said			0
" it 's almost impossible to be well and to be accomplished in the western world			0
" the key to kicking a habit like this is taking small steps , @entity10 said			0
replace the behavior -- such as the wine -- with a run or a stretch			0
and he 's not saying you ca n't indulge every now and then			0
for instance , if you 're exercising and controlling stress and love chocolate , it 's fine to have a piece of chocolate			1
" it 's when you have the bar of chocolate , and you 're becoming sluggish , you 're feeling tight , and you feel like you 're aging , then you sort of have to go back and look at the size of the piece of chocolate , " he said			1
like the biological systems he studies , @entity10 ' personal story is intricate and complex			0
despite attending schools such as the prestigious @entity194 , he did not graduate from college			0
at 19 , he went to his parents ' village in @entity198 and spent a year herding goats on the @entity202 - @entity201 border			0
he wrote a book on ancient funeral and exhumation ceremonies called " @entity206			0
" " when i came back i wanted to find for my artwork that kind of drama , " he said			0
" i found it in the x-ray files of teaching hospitals			0
" @entity10 became inspired by seemingly mundane black - and - white medical scans from the lab of his brother , an ophthalmologist			1
his photography of medical procedures became featured in @entity218			1
to take his ideas to the next level , @entity10 needed to be able to communicate with people in a wide range of disciplines and then bring those ideas together			1
he taught himself advanced mathematics and physics and , later , computer languages			0
he designed a lens for a microscope responsible for photographing the first images of human eggs in an in vitro fertilization program			0
a photograph of a fetus from outside the amniotic sac came about because of a lens he designed			0
and he started the company @entity237 , the umbrella of @entity239			0
despite not having a formal medical education , @entity10 has been able to showcase biological systems as never before			1
what he calls " visualizations " are not photos or animations , but rather the result of a collaboration between illustrators , biologists , programmers and researchers working with raw data			1
through their expertise , numbers and static black - and - white scans come to life			1
@entity10 and @entity46 met at the @entity259 conference in 2009 , right after @entity10 showed a film about fetal development			0
" as soon as i hit the bottom stairs , there was @entity46 there saying , ' only you can visualize consciousness , ' " @entity10 remembers			0
" i had no idea what he was talking about			0
" but the two got to talking about mind - body connections , and the value of @entity273 and @entity274 scans in visualizing them			0
they got to thinking about what happens in the brain not only when you 're stressed out , but also when you 're feeling joy			1
what happens if you 're a good parent and nurture your child ? we hear so much about things going wrong in your body -- what happens when you do something right ? these are some questions that they were interested in tackling together			1
and the last rule of wellness is , of course , " embrace @entity292			1
" @entity10 is often amazed as he sees how data can be transformed into meaningful visualizations that showcase processes in the body			1
at a certain point , he says , it becomes personal			0
for instance , while studying the effects of some experimental @entity302 's drugs on beta - amyloid plaques associated with the disease , he found out his mother has the disease			0
" the only thing you can do is get up in the morning and say , i 've got this very powerful data that if i can illuminate it to the point and interpret it to the point where i can help a researcher come to an epiphany because of the clarity of the information about what we 're actually seeing , then i 've done something good for my mother , " he said .			1

@entity14 has launched ' 9 @entity23 '
the first rule : know where you 're starting from
nutrition , exercise , sleep , stress and joy are other *topics*
the website makes use of visualizations , which bring medical data to life
