@entity4 , @entity1 @entity3 officials did n't pick up weather reports ahead of @entity8 's crash in person -- something that does n't mean the airline violated any policies but could mean it missed an opportunity for meteorologists to detail potentially dangerous conditions face - to - face , @entity1 's official weather service told @entity5			1
@entity19 , deputy director for meteorology at the weather agency @entity21 , said , " based on our records , there was no @entity3 flight operation officer that directly collected the flight document			1
" this practice appears to be common for @entity3 , according to @entity21 station chief @entity25			1
@entity5 did not see @entity3 listed in entries for a logbook running from december 31 to january 6 , for instance			1
the airline does n't dispute this , explaining it gets and distributes the same information not in person but by email			2
the documents are printed and brought onto the flight for pilots to see , @entity3 's @entity1 president director @entity34 told @entity5			1
one advantage of picking up such documents personally -- which in @entity4 , where @entity8 took off from december 28 , would be done at the @entity41 building -- is that it gives cockpit crew or airline operations staff a chance to review it with the meteorologist on duty , ask questions and get additional information , said @entity21 forecaster @entity49			1
but @entity3 argues that the official copy actually is n't as easy to read as the electronic version , which has the same information and comes in color			1
" our dispatch mirror the dispatch practices of numerous airlines globally , " @entity3 said in a statement			1
there 's been no apparent change in how the airline gets copies of weather information since @entity8 went down in the @entity62			1
but there 's now a change in how its staff process it : whereas pilots briefed themselves before the crash , there 's now a face - to - face briefing involving pilots and flights operations officers before each flight , @entity3 spokeswoman @entity66 said			1
@entity74 @entity75 @entity76 the @entity77 @entity78 @entity79 @entity80 @entity81 @entity83 @entity82 @entity84 @entity85 @entity86 @entity87 @entity88 @entity89 @entity87 @entity90 suspension of flight route @entity3 's handling of weather information is being investigated by @entity1 's transportation ministry , a top @entity1 aviation official told @entity5 on monday			1
it 's not the only thing			2
the airline 's practices have already come under scrutiny , including the fact @entity3 's @entity1 affiliate did n't have a license to fly the @entity4 - to - @entity106 route on the day that the plane disappeared , according to authorities			1
the airline was approved to fly the route four days a week but that did not include sunday , @entity1 's @entity109 said as it announced a full investigation and suspended @entity114 flights between the two cities			1
@entity114 has said it will cooperate fully with the investigation and would not be releasing any statement until the results were known , local media reported			0
but aviation authorities in @entity106 said there was no issue on their end			0
the @entity106 @entity123 said it had given @entity3 permission to fly the @entity4 - to - @entity106 route daily through march 28			1
it added that @entity3 was operating the flight four days a week , including sundays , but that " airlines may adjust their flight frequencies in the course of a season in response to market demand or operational requirements			2
" officials reassigned two officials in the @entity4 airport 's operations department have been reassigned , said the president director of the state - owned company that manages 13 airports in central and eastern @entity1			1
@entity140 said a department head and a section head were transferred monday at the order of the @entity109 and the @entity144 , pending an investigation			2
visibility an issue for searchers meanwhile , the search continues for wreckage and bodies from the @entity106 - bound flight , which went down with 162 people board after its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers			0
the cause of the disaster is still under investigation			0
big waves and visibility have been problems for searchers , according to officials			0
so far , 39 bodies have been found , and 16 of those have been identified publicly			0
three others have been identified , but officials still needed to inform their families			0
the aerial search began again wednesday morning just after dawn			0
the @entity172 has sent special equipment to try to tackle the muddy conditions , @entity1 military chief gen. @entity171 said monday			0
@entity176 divers assisting in the search have already been using side - scan sonar gear , which is designed to map the sea floor and capture accurate images for analysis			0
when they find submerged wreckage , divers could also face challenges like " jagged edges , torn fuselage , things hanging all over the place , " said @entity188 , an experienced commercial diver in the @entity189			0
" it 's going to be dark inside -- a lot of things for a diver to get snagged on , for its umbilical to get caught up on , to get disoriented , " said @entity188 , who says he 's helped in the aftermath of recent catastrophes , including the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in @entity194			0
highlighting the complexity of the challenge , @entity171 said monday that one large piece of wreckage initially believed to be part of the aircraft turned out to actually be from a ship			0
objects obscured by waves the ships and aircraft looking for remains from @entity8 have so far detected several large pieces of wreckage believed to be from the commercial jet , according to @entity1 officials			0
but they still have n't located the main body of the plane and the all - important flight recorders			0
a locator beacon in at least one of the plane 's so - called black boxes was manufactured by @entity221 , the same company that built the beacons on the still - missing @entity223			1
but the search for the @entity3 flight is markedly different than the hunt for the missing @entity228 airliner , since wreckage has already been found			2
records show there are fresh batteries in at least one of the @entity3 plane 's beacons , which are designed to send out pinging sounds for 30 days after a crash to help searchers find the black boxes , @entity221 president @entity230 said			1
some of the bodies found over the weekend were still wearing seat - belts , search officials said			0
the bad weather conditions brought about by @entity1 's monsoon -- including strong winds , thick clouds , heavy rain and big waves -- have hindered the teams ' efforts during nine days of searching			2
" as soon as you see something in the distance , it disappears behind a wave -- and then it 's very difficult to try and spot it again , " said @entity5 's @entity251 , who spent 15 hours out on a search vessel sunday			0
how can a modern airliner vanish ? @entity260 reported from @entity4 , @entity1			2
@entity261 and @entity262 reported from @entity263			0
@entity5 's @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .			2

two officials at @entity4 's airport reassigned , pending investigation
records show there were fresh batteries in at least one locator beacon
@entity3 's crew got the weather report electronically , not in person
