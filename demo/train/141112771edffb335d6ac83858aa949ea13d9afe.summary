-- the prosecutor in the @entity4 government 's case against an @entity6 diplomat charged in @entity7 with visa fraud related to her treatment of her housekeeper expressed dismay wednesday over the direction the case has taken			1
" there has been much misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the reporting on the charges against @entity26 , " said @entity4 attorney @entity14 about @entity6 's 39 - year - old deputy consul general for political , economic , commercial and women 's affairs , who was arrested december 12 in @entity7 by federal agents			1
" it is important to correct these inaccuracies because they are misleading people and creating an inflammatory atmosphere on an unfounded basis			0
" he was referring to reporting about @entity26 's arrest outside her daughter 's school , her detention in a cell with other women and her having been subjected to a strip search -- all of which raised diplomatic hackles in @entity44			1
prime minister @entity45 called the diplomat 's treatment " deplorable ; " @entity6 national security adviser @entity49 called it " barbaric , " @entity0 sister network @entity48 reported			1
@entity6 officials summoned @entity4 ambassador @entity51 , took away @entity4 diplomats ' identification cards that gave them diplomatic benefits and removed security barriers outside the @entity56 in @entity44			1
but @entity14 said @entity26 's treatment was justified			2
he cited an 11 - page complaint that alleged she had promised in the visa application under which her housekeeper moved from @entity6 to the @entity4 to pay her at least $ 9.75 per hour , the minimum wage in @entity7 , and to require that she work no more than 40 hours per week			1
but the complaint alleges that @entity26 then had the housekeeper , who has been identified as @entity64 , sign a second contract , which paid her less than $ 3.31 per hour and required that she work much longer hours			2
the second contract , which was not to be revealed to the @entity4 government , " deleted the required language protecting the victim from other forms of exploitation and abuse " and also deleted language that said @entity26 agreed to abide by @entity4 laws , he said			0
@entity26 is charged with one count of visa fraud -- which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison -- and one count of making false statements -- which carries a maximum sentence of five years			1
@entity26 's lawyer , @entity82 , said the allegations were unsubstantiated			2
" when the facts are looked at , it 's perfectly clear that dr. @entity26 did nothing wrong , " he told @entity0 's " @entity87			2
" " she paid her worker exactly what she was supposed to pay her and the government has simply made a whole series of spectacular blunders , which has enroiled ( sic ) them into quite a remarkable diplomatic kerfuffle			0
" he added that the housekeeper was paid " well above the minimum wage , " and that his client had -- at the housekeeper 's request -- sent a portion of that money to the housekeeper 's husband each month in @entity6			1
" the balance of her pay was paid to her in the @entity4 -- all of it , " he said			0
@entity82 accused the @entity4 government of having treated his client " like an ordinary @entity4 citizen charged with a crime			2
the fact is she is n't an ordinary @entity4 citizen			0
she 's a diplomat with immunity			2
" citizens of @entity6 express their outrage concern over the treatment by @entity4 authorities of @entity26 , not her alleged treatment of her housekeeper , has sparked outrage			1
on tuesday , outside the @entity56 in @entity44 , demonstrators seething over what they considered to be humiliating treatment of the @entity6 diplomat , carried signs protesting the @entity4 handling of the matter			1
" if @entity4 will not respect @entity6 , then @entity4 will not be respected in @entity6 also , " read one			1
in his statement , @entity14 noted that @entity26 was charged not only with trying to evade @entity4 law intended to protect domestic employees of diplomats and consular workers from exploitation , but also with causing the victim and her spouse " to attest to false documents and be a part of her scheme to lie to @entity4 government officials			0
" he bemoaned that public outrage was focusing not on @entity26 's alleged treatment of the housekeeper and her spouse , but on the @entity4 government 's treatment of the diplomat			1
" is it for @entity4 prosecutors to look the other way , ignore the law and the civil rights of victims ( again , here an @entity6 national ) , or is it the responsibility of the diplomats and consular officers and their government to make sure the law is observed ? " he asked rhetorically			1
@entity14 defended the handling of the arrest and custody , though his office was not involved			0
" @entity26 was accorded courtesies well beyond what other defendants , most of whom are @entity4 citizens , are accorded , " he said			0
" she was not , as has been incorrectly reported , arrested in front of her children			0
the agents arrested her in the most discreet way possible , and unlike most defendants , she was not then handcuffed or restrained			0
" in addition , she was allowed to keep her phone and make calls to arrange personal matters , including child care , he said			2
" because it was cold outside , the agents let her make those calls from their car and even brought her coffee and offered to get her food			2
it is true that she was fully searched by a female deputy marshal -- in a private setting -- when she was brought into the @entity191 ' custody , but this is standard practice for every defendant , rich or poor , @entity4 or not , in order to make sure that no prisoner keeps anything on his person that could harm anyone , including himself			1
this is in the interests of everyone 's safety			2
" @entity14 acknowledged that the alleged victim 's family has been brought to the @entity4 , but said that that happened after a legal process was initiated in @entity6 in an attempt to silence her and compel her to return to @entity6			1
an injunction was issued in september by the @entity209 seeking to stop @entity210 from " instituting any actions or proceedings against dr. @entity26 outside @entity6 on the terms or conditions of her employment , " the @entity6 @entity56 said last week in a statement			1
it said the @entity4 government had been asked to find her " and facilitate the service of an arrest warrant , issued by the @entity221 of the @entity222 in @entity44			0
" @entity14 said it had been necessary to bring @entity210 's family to the @entity4			2
" this office and the @entity226 are compelled to make sure that victims , witnesses and their families are safe and secure while cases are pending , " he said			0
complaints reach the highest levels still , the complaints from the @entity6 government , a close @entity4 ally , have reached the highest authorities			1
president @entity239 has been briefed on the issue , @entity238 spokesman @entity237 said			1
and the top @entity4 diplomat , secretary of state @entity241 , called @entity6 national security adviser @entity49 on wednesday and tried to smooth over the ruffled feathers			1
" as a father of two daughters about the same age as @entity26 , the secretary empathizes with the sensitivities we are hearing from @entity6 about the events that unfolded after ms. @entity26 's arrest , and in his conversation with @entity253 he expressed his regret , as well as his concern that we not allow this unfortunate public issue to hurt our close and vital relationship with @entity6 , " the @entity244 said			1
asked whether @entity241 's regret was about what happened in @entity7 or the response to it in @entity6 , @entity244 spokeswoman @entity259 said , " regret on the situation at large , i would say both , honestly			1
he certainly expressed regret about what happened with this case at large , sort of how this has all played out			0
" @entity259 said appropriate procedures appeared to have been followed in the arrest by @entity4 marshals , but that conditions surrounding @entity26 's processing would be examined " to ensure that all appropriate procedures were followed and every opportunity for courtesy was extended			0
" still , the charges stand			0
@entity259 also said that @entity26 enjoys " consular immunity , " a limited diplomatic immunity related to her official duties			0
under the 1963 @entity282 , consular officials can be arrested for acts committed outside official job functions			0
the @entity244 said @entity26 's consular immunity does not cover the charges she faces			0
@entity6 officials , too , appeared to be intent on keeping the diplomatic eruption from escalating			2
" let me assure you that there is no change in the security situation as regards to any diplomats in @entity6 , including @entity4 diplomats , " said @entity290 , a spokesman for @entity6 's @entity291			1
he said @entity4 officials should n't read too much into the removal of cement barriers in front of the @entity56 in @entity44			0
" @entity6 is fully committed to ensuring the safety and security of all diplomats in @entity44 and elsewhere			1
so , please do not have any doubts on that score ; we will provide full safety and security within the confines of @entity6 law			1
" @entity312 , a lawyer for the housekeeper , said @entity210 had tried to improve her situation by dealing directly with @entity26 , but the attempts were unsuccessful			2
the issue goes beyond a labor dispute for @entity210 and others in similar positions			0
" our clients who work as domestic workers are living in the home with their employers , " she said			0
" so , if they leave , they not only leave their legal status , they leave their only source of income , they leave the only home that they 've known in a foreign country			0
" she said @entity210 has no passport , is living with friends and has been granted temporary legal status that allows her to remain and work in the @entity4 until the matter is resolved			0
@entity210 herself has brought no claim against @entity26 and has no plans to do so , she said			0
a source who has spoken with @entity210 said she is in her early 40s and had worked previously with other diplomatic families in @entity6			2
@entity0 's @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 , @entity341 and @entity342 contributed to this report .			0
