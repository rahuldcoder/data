-- since 2001 , there have been many excellent , award - winning and ground - breaking films , both narrative and documentary , about the wars in @entity6 and @entity7			1
" the @entity8 , " " @entity9 , " " @entity10 , " " occupation : @entity13 , " " @entity12 , " " @entity14 , " " @entity15 , " " @entity16 , " " @entity17 , " " @entity18 , " " the prisoner : or how i planned to kill @entity20 , " " @entity21 " and so on			0
all of these films have their place			0
many are exceptional , moving and award - winning pieces of work , but of those that i have seen , none pack the visceral , emotional and artistic wallop that @entity31 ' documentary " @entity32 " delivers , and all without any politics whatsoever			1
there 's nothing , not one word of whether the @entity37 should be fighting these wars , why we 're there or who 's to blame			2
this is an intimate film about then - 25 - year - old @entity42 sgt. @entity42 , his wife ( and high school sweetheart ) @entity45 and the personal cost of war			1
it is also an astonishing technical achievement in war journalism and documentary filmmaking that may very possibly change the way conflicts are reported forever			2
@entity31 designed and built a customized steadicam rig ( a device that enables a filmmaker to move over an uneven surface without the camera bouncing up and down ) , allowing him to shoot footage that looks " @entity60 , " but was shot with a " prosumer " @entity63 digital slr : basically a still camera that shoots hd video			0
along with a customized sound rig , @entity31 was able to shoot intimate war footage that until now has been impossible			0
the combat footage is , however , only part of the story			0
six months into his third tour of duty in @entity6 and @entity7 , and just days from rotating out , @entity42 ( @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ) is gravely wounded during a @entity77 ambush			1
his hip and leg are broken , and blood transfusions and multiple surgeries are required to save his life			2
@entity31 was embedded with @entity71 when it was dropped deep behind enemy lines , and as an embedded reporter , he did his job , filming the troops in combat and interacting with @entity7 locals			1
during his time with the troops , @entity31 got to know @entity42 , and after he was wounded , @entity31 rejoined him in @entity91 and continued filming there			2
as the film moves back and forth between @entity7 and @entity91 , where @entity42 is undergoing rehab for his injuries , it becomes painfully clear that the hell of war does n't end when troops return home			1
and after watching the film , it 's unclear whether the " hell " of the title is @entity7 or back home			1
@entity42 ' injuries are horrific , and he 's on multiple medications			1
in an early scene , his wife is driving the pair on a shopping trip and he 's going through his meds ( @entity112 , @entity113 , etc. )			0
it 's a pharmacy of addictive painkillers			0
later in the film , one of @entity42 ' doctors explains the process of weaning him off the drugs , including withdrawal and the risk of dependency			1
it 's clear that @entity42 does n't want to have to use the drugs forever , as he continuously complains of being nauseated and out of it , but he is also is just as clearly becoming dependent on them			1
in @entity7 , life is chaotic and dangerous and terrifying , but it is also , on one level , very simple			1
troops are there to do one main thing : kill bad guys			0
( an early shot of a @entity135 instructor telling his charges that they are " experts in the application of violence " is chilling			2
) however , once a @entity135 returns home , the frustrations of everyday life can be crippling			1
for example , looking for a space in a crowded mall parking lot can be irritating enough as an everyday experience , but to a @entity135 recently returned from a war zone , this and many other mundane annoyances can be extremely frustrating , trivial and ultimately useless			2
add to that a body full of pain and medications , and you have the makings of a difficult re-entry into life on the home front			0
with injuries as severe as @entity42 ' , it 's virtually impossible to avoid getting hooked on pain pills			1
not only does the injury cause pain , but the brutal physical therapy that is needed to regain maximum usage of his leg is excruciating			0
the differences between the strong , vigorous and professional leader in @entity7 and the severely injured , angry , depressed , dependent and occasionally almost childlike man at home is shocking			2
one chilling scene involves @entity42 relating his mindset when he first joined the @entity135 : " all i wanted to do was kill people			1
" he was told by the recruiters that was the best answer they 'd heard			0
he says he no longer thinks that way , but it 's clear that the @entity135 and the wars have had a serious effect on his psyche , as he is rarely seen in the film without a handgun , nervously loading and unloading it , pretending to play @entity184 roulette and even sleeping with it , loaded , under his mattress			1
an additional casualty of the war is his wife , @entity45			0
portrayed as loyal and loving , it 's clear that at times , she is scared for , and occasionally of , her husband			0
@entity194 and his injuries have changed him , and in one unsettling scene , she recounts how there are times when @entity42 basically becomes a different person			1
friday marks the 10th anniversary of the start of the war in @entity7 , and if this film does anything , it reminds us that the cost of war extends far beyond those who die in battle			2
the returning troops and those to whom they return are also casualties , and they deserve our care and attention			0
" @entity32 " opened in @entity214 on wednesday and rolls out in major cities across the country over the coming weeks			2
check the movie 's website for the release schedule			0
the film is rated @entity221 as one would expect , it contains a fair amount of off - color language as well as some brutal imagery			0
but this is a documentary , and war is ugly .			0

" @entity32 " is a documentary that follows the life of a young @entity42
a reporter embedded with @entity71 was dropped behind enemy lines in @entity7
the @entity135 's injuries are horrific , and the film deals with his coping
