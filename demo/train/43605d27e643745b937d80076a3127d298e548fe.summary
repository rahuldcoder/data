@entity0 finds herself in an impossible position			0
she 's seriously considering what some believe is an inevitable second run for the presidency			2
but the four years she spent as @entity7 's secretary of state look a lot different today than when she left the administration more than a year ago			1
the surprise reset of @entity11 relations went awry over @entity12 and the promise of the @entity14 collapsed amid worsening civil war in @entity16 and the brutal advances of the @entity18 in @entity19			0
@entity21 lapsed into political chaos , violence flared anew in @entity24 , @entity20 remains under scrutiny , and the perennially tense situation between @entity27 and @entity28 exploded in violence again in @entity30			0
much of this reached crisis stage after she left the @entity34 , but @entity35 is on the hook for a lot of @entity7 's foreign policy legacy			1
and many experts say she needs to distance herself from it before launching any campaign for the @entity43			0
but the strategy for that is complex and risky			0
not only does it open @entity35 up to attacks from republicans like @entity50 uber - strategist @entity49 , who wrote on thursday that breaking with @entity7 " may not work so well " for her			1
but it also runs counter to what she , her advisers and supporters have been doing for the past two months			0
@entity35 recently published " @entity57 , " a 656 - page volume about her experiences as @entity62 's top diplomat that is noticeably thin on disagreements with @entity7			1
yes , @entity35 writes about conflicting opinions over arming @entity16 rebels and some smaller differences on drones			2
but she largely balked at her chance in the book to break with @entity7			1
it was a perfect opportunity to do so			0
if anything , @entity35 's aides and outside supporters responded to @entity50 criticism of her record at the @entity34 and drew her closer to her boss 's foreign policy			1
@entity82 , an outside rapid response and communications group , began tweeting and writing about @entity35 's accomplishments on a daily basis			1
it touted her book as a success , highlighted her work in the @entity92 and heralded @entity35 's " pivot to @entity94			2
" at the same time , @entity35 and her advisers retooled her promotional bio and worked out an answer for the question , " what did you accomplish as secretary of state ? " the world blew up during the book tour instead of stumbling on the question -- something @entity35 did more than once during the book tour -- she began to breeze through it			1
she highlighted a checklist of accomplishments and victories shared with @entity7			2
" thanks in large measure to @entity0 's leadership , people were finally able to say : ' @entity62 's back , ' " reads her new promotional bio			0
but a cascading series of world events that seemed to coincide with the book tour or the buzz around it challenged @entity62 's interests abroad in a big way and tested its influence			0
new and more difficult questions emerged			0
@entity7 's foreign policy was under fire on a number of fronts			1
acutely aware of the changing narrative , @entity35 has been trying to selectively distance herself from some of the messy foreign developments			1
but this week , she put it into clearer political context			0
in an interview with the @entity137 , @entity35 trashed the @entity7 mantra that reflects his cautious approach to foreign policy : " do n't do stupid stuff			1
" she said that was " not an organizing principle " and labeled the president 's decisions in @entity16 , with which she has long disagreed , a " failure			0
" ' hugging it out ' : @entity35 calls @entity7 to calm tensions this all appeared to cause more harm than good			1
@entity152 , @entity7 's former top adviser who now acts as his biggest defender outside the @entity43 , took her to task with a tweet , referencing her 2002 vote in favor of the @entity159			1
and liberals in her party spoke up about the quickness with which she broke with @entity7 in favor of hawkish rhetoric			2
@entity35 reached out to @entity7 this week to assure him that her comments did not represent an attack on his policies or his leadership			1
people close to @entity35 argue she used the interview to only articulate what she wrote in the book about @entity16			2
on the festering civil war , @entity35 writes that " the president 's inclination was to stay the present course and not take the significant further step of arming rebels , " while hers was to arm the rebels			2
" no one likes to lose a debate , including me			0
but this was the president 's call and i respected his deliberations and decision , " she writes			0
as secretary of state , though , @entity35 publicly expressed doubt with arming the rebels			1
" what are we going to arm them with and against what , " @entity35 told @entity197 in february 2012			2
" you are not going to bring tanks over the borders of @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 â€” that 's not going to happen			0
so maybe at the best you can smuggle in , you know , automatic weapons			0
" few hints of disagreement but there was little indication that she disagreed with @entity7 on other big issues during her time in his cabinet , including the pivot to @entity94 , a cease - fire between @entity27 and @entity30 the last time around , and working to curb @entity218 's nuclear ambitions			1
opinion : @entity35 pummels @entity7 foreign policy one former @entity35 aide said what @entity35 told the @entity137 reflected what she wrote in the book and that there 's no indication she 's being a " monday morning quarterback			1
" " i think it is wrong to assume that the fact things are going to sh * * abroad , that is why she is coming out so forcefully against him , " said a former @entity35 campaign aide			2
" the timing of this book , the timing of these interviews is coincidental			0
" @entity50 see @entity35 distancing herself from @entity7 as a boon for them			1
not only might it reinforce their anti-obama efforts , but it enables them to amplify their claims that @entity35 's just expedient			2
" she is cold and calculating and a hyper - positioning politician , " said @entity242 , a @entity50 strategist			0
opinion : @entity35 , @entity7 both wrong he was excited about the prospect of the @entity50 exploiting @entity35 's " voluminous " and " overwhelming " record of working with @entity7			1
the @entity248 also sees an opening			0
" @entity0 spent four years executing @entity7 's foreign policy and in year five of @entity7 's term , it 's ridiculous for @entity0 to try to swindle voters into thinking what 's happening around the world is n't a product of @entity7 - @entity0 diplomacy , " said @entity250 , spokeswoman for the @entity248			1
republicans are trying to exploit @entity35 's attempts to distance herself from the " @entity262			1
" " moving away from mr. @entity7 may look good on paper , but it may not work so well , " @entity49 wrote in an opinion piece for the @entity264			2
" for one thing , mrs. @entity0 can not point to any notable successes during her @entity34 tenure			0
" former vice president @entity270 also got in on it as well			0
" i do n't think it 's a slam dunk for her by any means , " he told conservative @entity273 's radio show on wednesday .			0

tied to @entity7 's foreign policy , @entity35 must find the right way to create some distance
trying to break with @entity7 , @entity35 created an *uproar* from his *loyalists* and liberals
@entity35 missed an opportunity in her *memoir* to create some distance from @entity7
@entity35 is tied to much of @entity7 's foreign policy from her time as secretary of state
