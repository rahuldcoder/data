-- at least one person was critically injured tuesday in @entity2 when police clashed with opponents of the government of president @entity6			1
according to @entity0 affiliate @entity8 , violence erupted in the municipality of @entity10 , in @entity11 , when the opposition tried to stop officers from confiscating election documents including voter lists			1
a man who was run over by a police tow truck was taken to the hospital in serious condition , @entity8 said			2
the tv news network also reported that the man in charge of the local electoral board was detained			0
acting on a ruling earlier tuesday by @entity2 's @entity26 , @entity11 police had confiscated lists of voters who participated in sunday 's primary elections			1
the court had ordered that the lists be confiscated so that electoral authorities could use them to investigate alleged irregularities during sunday 's elections			1
according to the @entity2 government , the court acted after a candidate who participated in the primaries complained his rights had been violated			0
the @entity2 @entity41 identified him as @entity43 , a candidate for mayor in the town of @entity46			0
" i have the right to ask for the voter lists to be reviewed , " @entity47 said , according to a statement published by the ministry			1
" i 'm asking for what is right			0
i saw a polling place where there were more votes cast than voters who showed up to vote			0
" but opposition leaders , including @entity61 state governor @entity60 , cried foul , saying the court 's ruling was an effort by the @entity6 government to intimidate voters who participated in the primaries			1
@entity60 called the decision to confiscate the voter lists tantamount to " state terrorism " and told @entity8 it would not stop the opposition from defeating @entity6 in the october 7 presidential elections			1
" we 're not afraid of what they may do , " @entity60 said about government officials ' possible reactions			0
" above their actions , above the @entity26 , above the government , above those institutions that have been sequestered , we 're going for total victory on october 7 in order to transform @entity2 into a democratic country			1
" opposition leaders cited the publication in 2003 and 2004 of the names of thousands of @entity2 who had petitioned for @entity6 to be recalled			1
many of the names of those who appeared in the so - called @entity89 were subsequently targeted by the @entity6 government , the opposition leaders said			2
@entity90 was a pro-government legislator who posted on his website the names of people who had signed a petition to remove @entity6			0
his said his rationale was that a @entity2 could look at the postings to determine whether his or her signature had been forged			0
but a study published last april in the @entity100 : @entity101 supported the concerns of the opposition			2
lead author @entity105 economist @entity104 concluded that signers of the 2003 recall petition whose names were subsequently made public saw their earnings drop by 5 % on average and their employment probability drop by 1.3 % when compared to those who did not sign the petition			0
that finding " is strongly suggestive that the main instrument of political retaliation " was the widely circulated database that contained the list of signers , the authors concluded			0
opposition attorney @entity122 told @entity8 that he was surprised when he saw the court 's ruling			2
by law , @entity122 said , the voter lists are supposed to be destroyed as early as 48 hours after the election , which expired tuesday			1
" we had a commitment since before the february 12 primaries to destroy the lists by burning them			2
this was to protect the identities and the rights of ( opposition ) voters because our country has lived very regrettable situations like the @entity89 , " @entity122 said			2
more than 3 million voters participated in sunday 's primary elections , twice as many as expected			0
@entity143 , the 39 - year - old governor of @entity144 won the primary with more than 60 % of the vote			0
@entity143 will run for the presidency against the incumbent @entity6 , who has been in power for 13 years			0
in a statement , the opposition group @entity149 said many of the records had already been destroyed			1
the group 's executive secretary , @entity153 , said lawyers were " already studying " ways to oppose the @entity26 's decision , which he called " absurd , unconstitutional and disproportionate			1
