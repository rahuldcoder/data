gentlemen 's clubs have been around since the 18th century , providing a safe haven for men who want to drink whiskey and read newspapers in peace			2
the original clubs are said to have started up in the @entity8 of @entity9 , but exist all over the world with varying levels of exclusivity , only three now exclude all women			1
not content with just gaining entry to these clubs , women are starting to create their exclusive spaces , but they are a far cry from the old cigar infused billiard rooms of old			1
these high tech hubs house women from all walks of life and allow them to rest , work out and socialize away from the male gaze			1
whilst many of the clubs exist in @entity9 , the trend towards women - only spaces has begun to catch on across the @entity30 and may spread further			1
@entity31 , founder and ceo of @entity33 explained that women have until now , " existed in a work / home rut " with no physical place to go , unlike their male counterparts who had clubs			1

" there 's been a paradigm shift which means that increasingly women are seeking out other women 's company			2

" not through any fault of their own , but because there was no physical place where they could go , so they toggled endlessly between the two			0
but men have always had that third space -- their clubs -- to put deals together , to network , to expand horizons or simply to disconnect from a harried world			0
i wanted to create that for women			0
and we need it now more than ever , given that our roles and responsibilities have greatly expanded			0
