entire buildings reduced to heap of rubble			0
shoes and clothes strewn throughout the debris , their owners nowhere to be found			0
after four months of intense fighting , @entity15 forces have liberated the @entity18 city from the grip of @entity5			1
their prize : utter devastation			0
@entity3 has been a coveted prize for @entity5 , which has been on a murderous campaign to establish an @entity25 state across parts of @entity18 and @entity27			1
the city sits on the border with @entity30 and would have given @entity5 a complete swath of land between its self - declared capital in @entity34 , @entity18 , and @entity30			1
and while there are many @entity5 battlefields in both @entity18 and @entity27 , @entity3 is within sight from the @entity30 border -- which means @entity41 media and the world could see the magnitude of the fighting			1
@entity15 forces wrestling for control of @entity3 have received a boost from hundreds of @entity48 and coalition airstrikes against @entity5			1
the strikes have hit terrorist targets , as well as buildings and houses			0
but after months of fighting @entity5 , the @entity3 area is now almost unrecognizable			1
" they were advancing with heavy weapons , tanks , artillery , mortars , heavy weapons			0
they attacked us , " said @entity61 , who is from a village just south of @entity3			1
then we took our cars and ran away			0
" now , the city is no better than the village he left , he said			2
many civilians fled @entity3 for refugee camps in less volatile areas when the fighting first started , but others could not flee -- or were forced by circumstance to return			2
" my daughter recently died			0
we brought the ( body ) here , " one woman said			0
" we said , we will not bury her in @entity30 ; we will bury her in @entity3 , our own mud is much sweeter than other 's homeland			1
" while there is barely anything left in @entity3 , it 's still home to people like @entity61			2
" i said i will not leave my city			2
i will stay here , and told my sons go wherever you want to go , " he said			0
" but for me , i will stay here , and i will die on the @entity18 land			2

@entity15 @entity96 forces have wrested control of @entity3 away from @entity5
