in a separate incident , @entity21 self - defense forces stormed the @entity24 military base , also in @entity3 , taking control of it , a @entity6 defense ministry spokesman said saturday			1
@entity6 forces on the base threw smoke bombs during the incident and retreated to the base 's headquarters , according to @entity32 , in a @entity34 posting			2
the base 's aviation brigade then sang the @entity6 national anthem , lowered the @entity6 flag and left the base , he said			2
the @entity41 reacted by urging @entity1 to open talks with the @entity6 government			1
" as we have said , the @entity1 military is directly responsible for any casualties that its forces -- whether they be regular uniformed troops or irregulars without insignias -- inflict on @entity6 military members , " said @entity44 , a spokeswoman for the @entity45 , in a statement			2
the reports " highlight the dangerous situation created by @entity1 and belie president ( @entity59 ) @entity58 's claim that @entity1 's military intervention in @entity3 has brought security to that part of @entity6			1
" the incidents occurred as international observers were set to arrive in @entity6 to monitor the security and human rights situation in a posting expected to last at least six months			0
but they will not enter the contested region of @entity3 , a statement from the @entity72 said , because this " became part of @entity1			2
" @entity74 annexed the territory this week following a controversial snap referendum there that produced an overwhelming majority of votes in favor of leaving @entity6 to join @entity1			2
the @entity80 will eventually deploy a total of 100 observers throughout @entity6 in hopes of " reducing tensions and fostering peace , stability and security			0
" they will also check that the rights of ethnic minorities are being protected			0
advance teams were to be deployed within 24 hours , the @entity80 said friday			0
the regional security organization may widen the mission to include 400 more monitors , and extend it for a second six - month period if requested by the @entity96 government			0
@entity1 , which is one of the @entity80 's 57 member states , approved the mission , according to state - run @entity1 news agency , @entity100			2
@entity1 's @entity101 said it hoped the observers ' work would " help to overcome the internal @entity6 crisis , stop rampant nationalist banditry , eradicate ultra-radical tendencies , help achieve national reconciliation and social respect , political , linguistic , educational , cultural and religious rights of the people in all regions of @entity6			1
" @entity1 has previously said it reserves the right to enter @entity6 territory to protect ethnic @entity1 from what it says is a threat from ultra-nationalists and fascists			1
meanwhile , @entity119 leaders have demanded that independent monitors be granted access to the @entity3 peninsula , which @entity1 now calls its own territory			1
@entity80 monitors made multiple attempts to enter @entity3 during the height of the crisis when pro-russian militias took control of the region			0
but armed men at the borders turned them back			0
@entity6 , the @entity133 and other @entity135 powers maintain that the @entity137 peninsula is still a part of @entity6			0

@entity96 going @entity135 @entity141 signed the political elements of a trade pact with the @entity154 on friday as @entity1 lawmakers finalized annexation of @entity6 's @entity3			1
the signing in @entity158 signaled @entity119 's solidarity with @entity6 and carries additional symbolic force			1
it was the decision by @entity6 president @entity162 in november to ditch the trade pact in favor of closer ties with @entity1 that triggered the protests that led to his ouster in february and spiraled into the current crisis			2
on saturday , @entity6 's chief prosecutor @entity169 , deputy prosecutor @entity170 and interior minister @entity171 told reporters that raids carried out friday on apartments and offices linked to two of @entity162 's cabinet members had turned up signs of corruption -- millions of dollars in cash , gold and jewels			1
@entity58 , flanked by the speakers of both houses of @entity1 's @entity185 , signed a treaty friday finalizing the accession to @entity1 of the @entity3 region and its port city of @entity190			1
@entity1 's @entity191 is based in @entity190 , making it strategically important to @entity74			2
the region also has a majority ethnic @entity1 population and long historical ties to @entity1			0
although @entity1 insists that its actions are legitimate , @entity6 's interim government has said @entity96 will never stop fighting for @entity3			1
the @entity6 naval fleet 's sole submarine has been taken over by the @entity1 , a spokesman for @entity6 's @entity199 said saturday			1
the @entity202 was taken over and placed under the flag of the @entity1 naval fleet when its commander abandoned it after deciding not to join with @entity1 forces , @entity32 , the @entity6 defense spokesman , told @entity14			2
the incident occurred near @entity190 , in @entity209			0
the @entity211 - era diesel - electric submarine is more than 40 years old , but was upgraded by @entity1 engineers a couple of years ago , according to the state - run news agency @entity100			0
@entity7 later said on his @entity34 page -- citing sources in @entity190 -- that @entity3 self - defense forces and @entity1 special forces had taken another @entity6 ship , the @entity219			1
the ship was captured " after a two - hour assault , " @entity7 said , though the @entity6 ship 's crew members came ashore and did n't suffer any injuries			1
fighting for @entity3 @entity74 has doggedly pursued its own course even as @entity135 leaders have denounced its actions as violations of @entity6 's sovereignty and a breach of international law			1
@entity133 president @entity232 plans to meet with leaders of the @entity235 group of industrialized nations next week to discuss @entity6			0
@entity1 has been excluded from the talks on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in the @entity240			0
a planned @entity154 - @entity1 summit has also been canceled , as the @entity135 seeks to increase @entity74 's isolation over its actions in @entity6			1
and a spokesman for the mayor of @entity246 , @entity245 , said friday he had canceled a planned high - level trade visit to @entity74 in october			0
that step followed a new round of sanctions imposed by @entity154 leaders thursday against 12 individuals			0
those sanctions brought to 33 the total number of people facing @entity154 asset freezes and travel bans			0
@entity1 @entity101 spokesman @entity258 dismissed the latest move by @entity154 leaders in a statement posted to the @entity101 website saturday			2
" it is a pity that the @entity263 adopted a decision which is divorced from reality , " he said			0
" @entity1 reserves the right to give an adequate response to the undertaken action			1
" the @entity133 announced its own new round of sanctions on thursday against 20 individuals and a bank which @entity133 officials say is linked to @entity58 and senior @entity1 officials			0
@entity275 had already announced sanctions on 11 individuals			0
further sanctions which would target @entity1 's economic interests are threatened by both the @entity154 and the @entity133 if @entity74 does not act to deescalate the situation			1
travel warning the @entity133 is keeping a close eye on the large - scale drills @entity1 's military are conducting near @entity6 's eastern border with the country			1
national security adviser @entity287 said friday it 's " not clear " what is signaled by @entity1 massing its forces near the border -- and suggested @entity275 is wary			0
" the @entity1 have stated that they are intending military exercises , " she said			0
" obviously , given their past practice and the gap between what they have said and what they have done , we are watching it with skepticism			0
" @entity300 also praised the @entity6 people and government for their " enormous restraint in the face of obvious provocation			0
" she added , " they 've made clear that their interest is in a unified , democratic future that is ... in an existence at peace with both @entity1 and with western @entity119 and the @entity133			2
" the @entity312 also issued a travel warning for @entity6 friday			0
it cautioned @entity133 citizens " to defer all non-essential travel to @entity6 and to defer all travel to the @entity3 and eastern regions of @entity318 , @entity319 and @entity320 due to the presence of @entity1 military forces in the @entity3			1
" while the transition to a new government has been largely peaceful , some clashes have broken out in eastern regions , the @entity312 said , and " groups advocating closer ties to @entity1 have taken on a more strident @entity330 tone , especially in @entity3			2
" @entity1 sanctions : @entity154 should leave trade alone sanctions on @entity1 : would @entity334 boycott hit harder ? opinion : @entity58 's breathtaking lies about @entity1 @entity3 remarries -- but that divorce will be messy @entity338 : @entity133 targets @entity58 's banker , threatens trade			1
