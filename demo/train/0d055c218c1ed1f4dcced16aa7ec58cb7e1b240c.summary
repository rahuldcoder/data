-- a few kilometers from the city center of @entity3 , @entity4 , is a natural phenomenon called " the meeting of the waters			1
" here , the @entity9 and @entity10 rivers join , but do n't mix -- light and dark waters , flowing side by side for 8 - 10 kilometers , due to different water temperatures , speed and acid levels			1
eventually , the two rivers become one , and the mighty @entity10 continues its journey through northern @entity4			1
it is just one of the countless features that makes @entity3 such a unique city			1
with the @entity24 as its backyard , @entity26 and city officials hope it will also be enough to draw in fans from around the world as one of @entity4 's 12 host cities for the @entity33			1
the city of two million people rises from the rainforest , isolated from much of the rest of @entity4 's population			2
traffic jams clog the streets			0
fishing boats dot the river			0
ports swarm with activity during the day , and overnight			0
in the middle of it all , a stadium is being built from the ashes of one that stood before it			0
in this spot , the @entity51 is being constructed to welcome the world next summer			2
the renderings of what the completed stadium will look like can be seen all over the city , from the sides of city buses to billboards above the busy streets			2
but in reality , there is still much to be done			0
in june , it was a still a concrete shell , with no seats , no roof , no grass			0
to complicate matters , having the rainforest as a backdrop is both a blessing and a curse			0
instead of having a full year to prepare , @entity3 has just a few months remaining until the intense rainy season hits in december			1
if the stadium is not ready by then , construction will become that much more difficult			2
@entity76 is the city liaison 's officer to @entity26 , overseeing @entity33 preparations for the city , and that includes the @entity51			1
in june , he estimated the stadium was about 65 percent complete , and on track to finish in december			2
sustainability the construction of the stadium is as unique as the city that 's building it			2
to save time , parts of the stadium -- such as the roof , for example -- are being built in other locations like @entity94 , @entity95 and southern @entity4			1
the pieces are then assembled in @entity3 , creating another challenge			0
" these logistics give us a big headache , " @entity76 said			0
" we need very good planning to have everything here at the right time			0
" meant to look like a basket made by indigenous tribes in the rainforest , eco-friendly elements have gone into its construction , so ample rainwater will water the pitch , while sunlight and wind will be harnessed for power			0
" when we thought about making this arena , we thought about sustainability , " @entity76 said			0
" everybody here in the @entity10 region worries about the environment , so we tried to follow that way of thinking ... like saving the rain water , using sunlight , and using the wind			0
" when it is complete , the stadium will hold 44,000 people , and cost an estimated $ 550 million @entity4 reais , or about $ 225 million -- if it is completed on time , and on budget			1
during the recent @entity130 , protests erupted over whether the money being spent on the @entity33 might be better invested elsewhere and in @entity3 the big question remains -- what will happen when the @entity33 is over ? @entity3 ' local football teams do n't draw in a big crowd			1
so the city has plans to use the stadium for other events , like concerts , conferences , and even @entity143 fights -- with jujitsu as perhaps the area 's most popular sport			1
city organizers are focused on the bigger picture , knowing the @entity33 can bring more than just a new stadium			1
they hope it will leave a lasting legacy of infrastructure improvements the city so desperately needs -- like more reliable electricity , internet , and transportation upgrades			0
long after the final whistle blows next summer , and a champion is crowned , that will be the true legacy of @entity3 as a @entity33 host city .			1

@entity3 , right next to @entity10 , is one of host cities for the 2014 @entity4 @entity33
a new stadium with sustainable features called @entity51 in construction
most of the work must be completed before the rainy season starts in december
the 44,000 - seater stadium cost $ 225m and will also host concerts and conferences
