@entity0 -- two aging former military commanders who masterminded a 1980 coup d'etat in @entity5 failed to appear in court wednesday due to health reasons , the semiofficial @entity2 reported			1
@entity9 , a nonagenarian retired army general and former president , and former air force chief @entity12 face charges of committing " acts against the forces of the state , " according to the indictment			1
prosecutors are asking for a penalty of " aggravated life sentence " if the two former commanders are found guilty			0
hundreds of activists gathered outside the courthouse in @entity23 on wednesday morning			0
many held portraits of victims tortured or executed in the aftermath of the september 12 , 1980 , coup			1
" we wo n't forgive , " said one demonstrator 's sign			0
the activists present represented a broad range of @entity5 's political spectrum , from communists on the far left to labor unions and militants from the ultra-nationalist right			1
" it 's a turning point			0
it 's incredible , " said @entity39 , a veteran @entity5 television broadcaster and author of the book " @entity42 in @entity5 : an @entity44 of 12 september 1980			1
" until recent years , military commanders acted with relative impunity in @entity5 , regularly intervening in domestic politics and -- on at least four occasions in the past 60 years -- overthrowing governments			2
many @entity5 commentators said wednesday 's trial marked a historic reversal for the army generals			1
" @entity5 's first face - off with military coups starts today , " announced the headline in the english - language @entity55 on wednesday			1
" i never really thought that one day i would see this , " added @entity39			0
@entity9 , now 94 , led the overthrow of the @entity5 government when he ordered tanks out into the streets of the capital in the predawn hours of september 12 , 1980			1
@entity9 appeared in uniform on @entity5 state television later that afternoon and made the following announcement : " my dear citizens , i would like to state one more time that armed forces had to take over the administration for the welfare and happiness that the dear @entity5 nation deserved , for the unity of the country and nation , to renew the strength and functionality of @entity76 principles which were tried to be made less effective , to place democracy that can not control itself on firm foundations , to restore the state authority which had been lost			1
" the military overthrow brought an end to years of bloody killings between right - and left - wing @entity5 militants , and many prominent voices in @entity5 and abroad initially welcomed the coup			1
a passage from " @entity5 unveiled , a @entity91 " recalls : " the cover of @entity93 showed a paternalistic portrait of @entity95 clasping a collage of the @entity0 skyline in his arms with the caption ' holding @entity5 together			2
' " " at the beginning , everyone said , ' @entity100 , thank @entity103 that they saved us , ' " @entity39 recalled			0
" but six months later , everything changed and this was the worst - case scenario			0
" in the aftermath of the military takeover , accounts of appalling human rights violations began to emerge , as hundreds of thousands of people were thrown in jail , many of them tortured			0
the military junta also disbanded political parties , jailed senior politicians and sentenced hundreds of people to death			0
longtime @entity5 - watchers argue @entity5 society is still struggling with the consequences of the coup			1
" september 12th is the mother of all coups in @entity5 's history , " said @entity123 , columnist and deputy editor of the @entity5 daily newspaper ' @entity125			1
' it damaged the whole country and probably caused incurable damage on one whole generation of the youth in this society			0
" " it brought @entity5 politics back to the kindergarten , " said @entity134 , co-author of " @entity135			2
" " ( @entity139 ) somehow wanted to force the politicians to be less conflictual , but he did so by dumbing them down to the point that @entity5 's political system is still recovering from it ... unfortunately the consequences of his actions ruined so many people 's lives			1
one has to wonder how @entity5 is going to deal with that			2
" after stepping down from the post of president in 1989 , @entity9 lived for years on @entity5 's @entity151			1
one of his widely reported pastimes was painting			0
the former coup leader 's works of art have even been displayed in exhibits			2
according to an article in the @entity5 constitution , which was written by the military junta in 1982 , @entity9 and his fellow officers were protected from prosecution			1
but recent constitutional changes drafted and ratified by prime minister @entity165 's ruling @entity164 cleared the way for a prosecutor to question @entity9 at his home last year			2
@entity165 's government has also overseen the arrest and trial of dozens of other army generals accused of a much more recent military coup plot that was never successfully carried out			2
among those arrested are retired general and army chief of staff @entity176 , who commanded the @entity5 armed forces until 2010			1
he stormed out of a courtroom outside @entity0 last week , after court officials played recordings of wiretapped phone conversations			0
some critics have called the prosecution of these military commanders a witch hunt , targeting political opponents of @entity165 's government			0
other observers argue it has been a vital process to bring the military under the control of elected civilian leaders			0
since 1960 , the once politically - dominant @entity5 armed forces have overthrown four governments			2
" ending the belief of impunity is very , very important , " said @entity123 of ' @entity125 ' newspaper , which has published many damning reports about the @entity5 military in recent years			2
" it 's a huge step , obviously very late			0
these generals are very old			0
but it 's still symbolically very important for this country			0
