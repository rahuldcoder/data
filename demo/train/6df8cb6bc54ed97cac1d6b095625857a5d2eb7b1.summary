-- one man 's dream voyage is @entity4 's nightmare			1
for the @entity12 's new reality series " @entity13 , " the @entity6 radio producer ( who has acquired an international cult following as funnyman @entity10 ' favorite target ) embarked on an all - expenses - paid , seven - country , several - month vacation -- and hated every second of it			1
" i kept saying , ' i do n't want to do this , ' but [ @entity10 ] was making me go , " @entity4 said			1
" i do n't like it			2
you can have your money back -- but the cameraman 's been paid , the director 's been paid			2
i could n't get out of it			2
" the lighthearted travel documentary , originally produced by @entity10 and longtime collaborator @entity27 for @entity6 's @entity28 , follows a reluctant @entity4 to the @entity29 , the @entity30 and every " @entity31 " in between			1
in the show 's first episode , which debuted in the @entity34 on saturday , @entity4 surveyed the hazy , mountainous @entity36 skyline and frowned			1
the @entity37 stretched into the distance			2
" being honest with you , it 's not the ' great ' wall of @entity42 , " he said			2
" it 's an all right wall			2
it 's the ' @entity45 of @entity42			2
' " amid a crowd of photo - snapping tourists , @entity4 did n't hide his bemusement at more than 31,000 miles of historical ( but recently renovated ) stone			1
" am i missing something here ? " he said			0
" so the old stuff 's gone on it , really ? then it should n't be a wonder then			0
" back in @entity55 , @entity10 cackled at @entity4 's candid reactions			1
" i do n't know the politically correct term -- moron			0
he 's a round , empty - headed , chimp - like moron , " @entity10 remarked during the premiere episode , which attracted a loyal fan base in the @entity6 in september			1
" and he 's a friend			0
" the show is a " prank turned social experiment , " @entity10 said in the series preview			1
he and merchant plotted region - specific activities ( like toad chewing , traffic dancing and fortunetelling ) to surprise the self - proclaimed recluse and immerse him , deeply and hilariously , in foreign cultures			2
@entity12 representative @entity74 said " @entity13 " broke network records for saturday night ratings			1
an explosive response on @entity78 and @entity79 confirmed what @entity74 expected after the network landed the show for @entity34 television in november			0
" it 's a monster hit , " she said			0
" @entity4 brings cool , childlike wonder to the places he explores			1
viewers can laugh while taking away an important lesson -- he inspires you to travel with your eyes wide open , live the adventure			0
" @entity4 , who said he 'd rather have a quiet weekend by a beach in @entity94 or @entity95 , never wanted to live the adventure			1
when @entity10 and merchant could n't persuade him to sign on , his girlfriend , @entity97 , pushed him to step out of his comfort zone			1
" i blame her for this , " he said			0
" she said i 'd regret passing this up , and i ca n't say no to her			0
" much of @entity4 's reluctance stemmed from @entity10 ' habitual teasing			1
he knew the comedian , who has been his colleague since @entity4 began working on the " the @entity106 " on @entity55 radio station @entity107 in 2001 , had designed every step of the journey for maximum discomfort			1
" @entity10 's always doing things to annoy me , " he said			1
" that 's what keeps him alive , i think			0
i 'm used to it now			0
" of all the places @entity4 visited -- the eight - episode series takes viewers to @entity42 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 -- he said @entity36 was one of the most bizarre			1
" i do n't know what the rules are there , " he said of popular street food			0
" i saw a woman eating a scorpion on a stick , and she was normal , was n't a lunatic			0
yet there she was , just eating a scorpion			0
of all the creatures on the planet , they 're the worst to look at			0
" though @entity4 would n't recommend such snacks with exoskeletons , he said straying from " touristy things " and interacting with locals were eye - opening experiences			2
" you see , they 're the same as you , but they do different stuff , " he said			0
" at the time , i was n't enjoying that			0
but now that i 'm back , i think that 's what that is about -- realizing we 're not all so different			0
