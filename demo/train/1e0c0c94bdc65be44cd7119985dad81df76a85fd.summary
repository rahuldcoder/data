-- you have shot more than enough photos , captured tons of video and have written a rough draft of your story , so what 's next ? you always want to double - and triple - check your story elements before sending them in			1
here are a few tips to help you determine the best elements to pick when putting together your story			1
do n't over edit , but give it a few reads when writing , think first about the overall purpose of the piece			2
what is your intention ? it could be to shine light on something that no one else has covered			2
in all instances , consider both sides of the equation			2
if you are simply telling the personal tale of one person , consider what about this person 's story is interesting to you			1
what are the things you would need to know that would make your story stand out to a reader ? find a way to relate the story to your audience			1
write all that out and then give it a couple of reads			2
it 's always easiest to put everything down on paper and then go back and edit as necessary			1
@entity44 out what slows down the text is best			0
but if you have a good quote , center the piece on it			0
for example , if you 're covering a protest , include some of the best quotes from the protesters you interviewed			0
was there a recurring theme among them ? did folks have a personal stake in being at the protest ? review the strongest interviews and quotes , then write your supporting text to give the user context and explain why they should care			0
choose the most compelling photos you can have a maximum of 10 photos for your story , so you want to make sure they complement the story in the best way possible			1
if you are writing a story about protests , include images that reflect the angst , frustration and emotion in protesters ' faces			1
pick the photos that provide a snapshot of that particular moment			0
you want to take your audience inside your story			1
video and text should complement each other what is the value of the video ? usually , when we have text and video , we want each element to be able to stand on its own			0
if they are published separately , the reader should be able to follow the story			1
however , when video is combined with text , the video should be added value to the overall vision or message of the piece			0
video and text should complement each other			0
the text should not just be a transcription of the video			0
in keeping with the same theme , if you 're covering a protest , then the video should put the user in that moment			0
the video could include great natural sound of protesters , chanting and speaking			0
it could provide one person 's point of view as opposed to putting every single protester in the video			2
this will also help keep your video within the two - to three - minute time frame			0
