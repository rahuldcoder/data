-- the man now synonymous with hunting bad guys had no intention of a career catching fugitives			2
@entity6 was a hotel developer in south @entity7 , living a seemingly idyllic life with his wife and son , when a horrific tragedy changed his life -- and the lives of thousands of strangers			1
here are five things to know about the host of @entity0 's @entity17 with @entity6 : 1			1
his son was kidnapped and killed @entity21 's life unraveled in 1981 when his 6 - year - old son , @entity22 , was abducted from a mall near their home in @entity26 , @entity7			1
two weeks after @entity22 's disappearance , his severed head was discovered in a canal 120 miles away from the mall			2
the devastation led @entity21 to dedicate himself to catching fugitives and seeking justice for crime victims			2
helping nab the bad guys is his mission for more than a decade , @entity21 was known as the host of @entity39 -- a groundbreaking show that put fugitives ' profiles in the national spotlight			1
the @entity45 credits @entity39 for leading to the capture of 17 of the fugitives who have appeared on the agency 's @entity48			1
@entity21 says 1,200 suspects have been caught as a result of the show			1
what was one of his best gets ? @entity21 says he accomplished in three days what the @entity45 could n't do in 18 years : finding and capturing murderer @entity58 , who killed his wife and three children			1
he 's a co-founder of the @entity62 before @entity65 's kidnapping and death , there was no national database on missing children			1
law enforcement officers could enter information on stolen cars , stolen guns and stolen jewelry -- but there was no central place to keep information on missing children			0
so @entity6 and his wife @entity78 pushed @entity79 to pass the @entity80 , which led to the creation of the @entity62			1
according to its website , the center has helped law enforcement find more than 196,000 missing children since it was founded in 1984			0
" our recovery rate for missing children has grown from 62 percent in 1990 to 97 percent today , " the center says			0
the site is n't just for law enforcement officers and missing children 's families			0
at least one young woman discovered she was abducted as a newborn by using the database			0
@entity97 , now 27 , knew something was amiss when the woman who claimed to be her mother did n't resemble her and could n't provide her birth certificate			0
so she logged onto the @entity62 and found what turned out to be her baby picture -- eventually solving her own kidnapping			2
after reading about @entity97 's case , a @entity106 man who was adopted from an orphanage also searched the database and found a baby photo of himself			0
his father had reported him missing three decades earlier			0
@entity113 's family counts @entity21 among her rescuers after her abduction at age 14 , @entity113 was held captive for nine months			1
she was starved , threatened , tortured and raped on a daily basis			0
while she was missing and her family searched for answers , her father @entity118 turned to @entity21			2
" he said , ' be straight with me			0
tell me what the odds are			0
you 're the one guy who can tell me the truth , ' " @entity21 told @entity0 in 2010			1
" and i said , ' you know what @entity118 , 99 % of the cases i do have a very unhappy ending			0
you 're lucky to find the remains , if you do			0
' " but @entity21 put a photo of @entity113 's suspected kidnapper on @entity39			1
days after watching the show , a woman spotted the suspect in suburban @entity137			0
@entity21 also has a connection to the @entity140 case for roughly a decade , @entity140 kept three young women captive in his @entity143 home , abusing and raping his victims in what became known as the " house of horrors			2
" @entity21 profiled two of the missing women -- @entity140 and @entity140 -- several times on @entity39			1
in a bizarre twist , it was @entity140 's daughter @entity153 who appeared on the show to appeal for help in finding her friend @entity140 -- unaware that her father was actually hiding and abusing @entity140 in his home .			2

@entity6 started a career in victim *advocacy* after his son was abducted and killed
more than 1,200 suspects were caught *due* to his show @entity39
@entity21 is now the host of @entity0 's @entity17 with @entity6
he is also a co-founder of the @entity62
