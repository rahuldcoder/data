-- it 's a time - honored adage about the laws of probability : give 1 million monkeys 1 million typewriters and they 'll eventually type the entire works of @entity7			1
now , a software developer in @entity9 is putting that saying to the test			1
and his digital monkeys are off to a good start			0
this weekend , @entity14 wrote on his blog that a computerized simulation of the theoretical simian typing pool has completed " @entity18 , " a narrative poem that appeared in a book of @entity7 's sonnets			1
" this is the first time a work of @entity7 has actually been randomly reproduced , " @entity14 wrote			1
" furthermore , this is the largest work ever randomly reproduced			0
it is one small step for a monkey , one giant leap for virtual primates everywhere			0
" @entity14 's virtual monkeys began typing on august 21			1
using open - source software called @entity32 , he created a huge group of " monkeys " that input random strings of gibberish			2
when a chunk of text matches a word used in @entity7 's catalogue , it gets crossed off of a database of the plays and poems			1
his database comes from @entity47			0
so far , he said , over 5 trillion character groups have been churned out			0
based on a page updating the project 's progress , several more works might be checked off the list soon			2
the monkeys appear to need only two more words to complete the comedy " @entity58 " and seven more to bang out " @entity57			2
" ( there 's been no explanation for why the computer monkeys seem to be lagging behind on @entity7 's tragedies			1
) " the monkeys will continue typing away until every work of @entity7 is randomly created , " @entity14 wrote			1
permutations of the @entity67 dates back as far as @entity68 ( although he obviously did n't have a typewriter )			2
@entity14 's inspiration came from a perhaps less likely source : " @entity72			0
" he says it harks back to a " @entity72 " scene in which mr. @entity77 chains up 1,000 monkeys , giving them the task of writing a great novel and berating one of them for typing , " it was the best of times			0
it was the blurst of times			0
" @entity14 's approach is , if nothing else , gentler			0
" no monkeys were harmed during the making of this code , " he wrote .			2

@entity94 ' monkeys ' with typewriters complete @entity7 's " @entity18 "
project is the brainchild of a @entity9 developer and aims to test the *classic* " @entity67 "
it began last month and will continue until @entity7 's entire catalogue is reproduced
the program types random *bursts* of code , crossing words off when they match @entity7 's
