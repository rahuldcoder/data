-- i spent a recent saturday morning at a field house in @entity3 , @entity4 , where girls with pink hair and stars and rainbows drawn on their cheeks run 27 laps around a gymnasium track			1
that may not seem like international news , but it should be			2
their race was part of the international " @entity20 " program , which is amazingly effective at empowering young women			1
i watched most of the race from the sidelines with @entity23 , a grandpa wearing a driver 's cap , and @entity27 , the mother of one of the young runners			1
" good job ! keep going ! love you ! you 're awesome ! " " remember to breathe ! " encouragement is the hallmark of the program , which pairs girls with adult mentors who help train them to run a @entity37 -- and , more importantly , talk to them about what it means to be women in modern @entity41			0
" you have to set a goal to become a powerful girl on the run , " @entity42 , the local organizer , with a feather stuck in her hair , told the girls before the race			0
" each of us is unique , and that is what makes us so powerful			0
with every heartbeat and every breath , we are changing the world			0
" these girls are changing the world and @entity4 , the state @entity60 crime estimates rank as having the highest rate of reported rape in the country			1
teaching young women that they can be whoever and whatever they want to be is an important part of preventing rape and abuse			1
i visited @entity4 in december because you voted for me to cover rape in the @entity41 as part of @entity0 's @entity74 project , which focuses on bottom - of - the - list places like @entity4			1
@entity27 , the mom i watched the race with , and whose last name i 'm not using to protect her privacy , was a victim of domestic violence			1
her husband beat her , she told me , and she got together with him when she was 13 and he 22			0
one reason @entity27 brought her daughter to @entity20 , with the help of a scholarship and free sneakers , is that she does n't want her daughter to accept violence against women			1
" instead of me just sitting back and taking it , ( my kids ) see me standing up , " she said			0
" and that 's what they need			1
otherwise , they will grow up and think it 's ok			1
" that 's hugely important			1
but the largely unspoken reality also remains : victims are n't to blame for rape and domestic violence ; offenders are			1
so , while they are essential , programs like @entity20 are n't enough to end what @entity4 's governor has termed its " epidemic " of rape and violence against women			1
to stop the violence , men have to stop raping and battering			1
that seems like common sense			0
but it 's still controversial			2
for evidence , look no further than @entity114 , an attorney and rape survivor who went on @entity116 last year to make that very point			2
other pundits argued that women should carry weapons to protect themselves			0
men should stop raping , and that would solve it			2
for those remarks , she received death threats			0
on @entity128 , one person wrote , according to a news report , " i hope you get raped and your throat slit			0
" this same pro-gun sentiment came up in the comments sections of other @entity74 stories published earlier this month about rape in @entity4			1
" time to arm and train the women to defend themselves , " one person wrote on my op - ed about a lawless village at the far edge of the state , where troopers fly in by plane			0
that 's wrong - headed			2
instead of putting the burden on women to defend themselves , the state should continue to expand its @entity149 program			0
i hope it soon will include that village			0
" what we have been doing for the past 100 years has n't been working , " @entity114 told me by phone from @entity153			2
" focusing on women 's behavior is n't working			1
" @entity23 , the adoptive grandpa who i spoke with during the race in @entity3 , gets it , too			0
" they need a program for boys , that 's for sure , " he told me			2
" they 've got this program to rebuild the confidence and self esteem in the girls , and keep them going			0
but where is the support structure to stop it in the boys ? you know , break the cycle			0
" @entity4 has more of a jump - start on that than some states			1
it was encouraging to see members of a local men 's high school basketball team acting as cheerleaders for the @entity20 event			1
those players , from @entity3 's @entity183 , are participating in a program called @entity185			2
it 's designed to teach young men about safe relationships and respect for women			1
gov. @entity191 , a @entity192 , has requested $ 12.4 million to fund his " @entity196 " initiative , which also is aimed at preventing violence and helping survivors			2
but such programs should be expanded			0
we have to keep encouraging girls , but always remember offenders are to blame			1
some of that should happen through formal training and programs			0
it 's also on all of us to call out inappropriate behavior when we see it			2
the family i sat with as we watched the girls sprint by understood this			0
when @entity27 's son reached out to give his sister a whopping high - five , his mom told him that he had to remember to be gentle -- to support her , not hit her			2
" hands are for high - fives and hugs , not hitting , " she said			0
the next time his 9 - year - old sister came around , he gave her the softest of bear hugs			0
" good job ! " the young runner seemed grateful for his support			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			1

@entity4 has the highest rate of reported rape in the nation
@entity232 : efforts to prevent rape should focus more on men
" victims are n't to blame for rape and domestic violence ; offenders are , " he writes
