@entity0 , @entity1 -- not many people would see quadriplegia as a gift			0
but then , not many people are @entity7			1
as a 21 - year - old @entity10 student , @entity7 's life was full of possibility			1
an undergraduate studying business at one of the best universities in the world , there was a lot to look forward to for the young man from @entity19			0
then a freak accident changed everything			1
@entity7 slipped on a wet floor , breaking his neck and rendering him paralyzed from the chest down			1
he retained the use of his arms , but not his hands			0
@entity28 spent the next five years traveling to rehabilitation centers across the @entity30 in search of a way to walk again			1
when a doctor finally suggested it was time to concentrate on living instead of walking , @entity7 did exactly that			2
almost 30 years later , the 55 - year - old father of two is now set to represent the @entity30 in sailing at the @entity37			1
" it 's an evolutionary process where you transition from one life to the other , " @entity7 told @entity2			2
" i never gave up moving forward			0
you can define that as walking or being a contributing member of society			0
at 26 i chose the later			0
" golden hopes next week @entity7 and his two team mates -- both amputees -- will take to a 24 - foot boat for the three - person sailing event at the @entity37			1
skipper @entity7 drives the boat by wearing rollerblading gloves on his hands , attached to bicycle pedals			2
the pedals are in turn linked to a pulley system that steers the vessel			0
this will be @entity7 's second @entity37 , after his debut at @entity58 in 2000			1
the @entity30 team failed to win a medal , but as @entity7 admits he was still fresh to the sport			1
with a fifth place in the @entity64 in @entity65 last year , this time gold is on the cards , he insists			0
watch : sailing for social change it would be an incredible achievement in a life already marked by success			0
@entity7 returned to @entity10 in 1983 , becoming the first quadriplegic to graduate from the university			1
he then went on to work at @entity74 as an asset manager for 15 years			1
" everyone is quite capable of doing much more than they think they can , " @entity7 said			2
" once they realize that fact , then the world becomes their oyster			0
" sail to prevail it was a chance sailing trip in 1995 that sparked @entity7 's love for the sport -- and a new venture that would help thousands of disabled children			1
" i got on a sailboat and looked back at my empty wheelchair on the dock , " @entity7 said			2
" it was the first time in 15 years i was able to do something on my own			1
it was an incredible moment			0
" so inspiring was the experience , @entity28 left his @entity97 job and took over sail to prevail -- a non-profit organization that teaches disabled children to sail			1
watch : sailing solo around the world from starting with eight children a year , the charity , based in @entity104 , @entity105 , now helps around 1,000 youngsters annually			1
their disabilities vary from spinal cord injuries to autism , and @entity7 says when he races for gold next month , it 'll be for them			2
" when we get on the starting line against 14 other countries , i want to win a gold medal just as much as they do -- but i 've got an additional motivation , " he said			0
" the better my team does , the more powerful impact it will have for @entity98 to prevail			0
" the gift it is perhaps a testament to @entity7 's mental strength that he views his disability as a special opportunity in life			2
" i 've been given an extraordinary gift where i can affect people 's lives in ways other people ca n't			0
so i see it as a responsibility , " he said			0
there have been some dark moments @entity7 admits			2
but with his wife , @entity141 , 9 - year - old twin sons and the @entity37 on the horizon , what 's the point in dwelling on that instant he slipped on a wet floor ? " i 've been very fortunate , " he said , adding : " you 've only got a limited amount of time in life			1
so you may as well choose to put that towards positive effort , rather than squandering it on the negative			0
