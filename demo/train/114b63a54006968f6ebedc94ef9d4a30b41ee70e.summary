@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a forest of pines to the east of @entity0 , @entity6 and his seventy men were digging in thursday			1
a man in his late - fifties with a magnificent beard and four different weapons , @entity6 freely admitted he was not a local			1
but he was here -- he said -- to resist the " @entity1 fascists " in @entity14 , a nearby town just recaptured by government forces			1
he was dismissive of the group that had fled @entity18 -- " cossacks , " he sneered			2
he had already lost seven men , but his fighters were the bravest			2
they would not run away			2
@entity22 was revealing in several ways			0
pro-russian separatists working in eastern @entity1 are better organized , better armed ( @entity6 's group had a truck - mounted anti-aircraft gun that was clearly working ) , and more of them appear to come from beyond @entity1			1
and they are building a maze of roadblocks and defensive positions across the region			0
but a few kilometers beyond , in rolling countryside under a hot sun , a very different group was setting up camp : a substantial force of @entity1 paratroopers , with armored personnel carriers and artillery			1
above , a reconnaissance plane drifted in loops			0
both sides look -- at least militarily -- more competent than they did a few weeks ago			0
checkpoints used to be few and far between			0
now there is a maze of them -- more separatist than @entity1 -- dotted across both the @entity51 and @entity52 regions			1
the insignia of the " @entity54 " -- a group that includes both @entity56 and local fighters -- is common at the roadblocks that have sprung up on the main roads leading into @entity51			0
a few weeks ago , we watched the bedraggled remnants of the @entity1 army 's @entity61 surrounded and harangued by locals near @entity64			1
now there is a sense of purpose among the units newly deployed , and a greater readiness to use heavy armor			0
throughout an extensive tour of the @entity0 area , the crump of artillery and boom of tankfire sounded periodically			0
but the targeting is sometimes puzzling			0
@entity14 is a town of some 20,000 people and a major railway junction			0
but one of its two hospitals is in ruins , struck repeatedly by what appeared to have been mortars or shells			0
there was also evidence of strafing from the air			0
a tearful nurse approached us , saying that whoever had done this was not human			0
she -- and others -- thought @entity1 forces were responsible , but they could not be sure			1
patients had been evacuated , but one middle - aged man sat listlessly on a bench outside			1
he had nowhere to go , he told us ; a doctor came past once a day to give him an injection			0
the new mayor , installed thursday as @entity104 's local appointee , said he would investigate the bombing of the hospital			2
but for the government , recovering @entity14 is a rare victory -- and judging by the number of troops installed around the town , one it intends to protect			0
now @entity1 armor seems intent on squeezing separatist positions closer to @entity0			1
it seems like eastern @entity1 is half - way through a game of chess , pieces scattered across the board in threatening positions , with neither black nor white close to checkmate			1
@entity123 , whatever their allegiance , are suffering the consequences			1
the main highway that links @entity0 and the @entity56 border , a route crowded with trucks just a few weeks ago , is deserted			0
in places the tarmac is chewed up by the impact of mortar fire			0
but once in a while an ancient , battered car lurches onto the road from a farm - track			2
a family has escaped from @entity0 , where water and electricity supplies are faltering and fresh food is getting more difficult to find			0
the intentions of either side in this scattered war of attrition are hard to work out			1
some @entity1 analysts say that @entity56 president @entity147 has what he wants already , a simmering insurgency that can be stoked any time @entity1 's new leader , @entity150 , looks to deepen his country 's relationship with @entity153 and @entity154			1
there seems to be no attempt from the @entity56 side to stem the growing flow of fighters crossing into @entity1 , and border clashes have intensified			1
as for @entity104 's strategy , it 's unclear as of now whether it feel its " @entity168 " can overcome the separatists or at least redress the military balance as a precursor to negotiations			2
what seems unlikely is that @entity150 will accede to the demand of the prime minister of the self - declared @entity172 , @entity171 , who told @entity2 there would be no talks until @entity1 forces left the @entity51 and neighboring @entity52 regions			1
@entity150 's message to the east in his inauguration speech saturday will be closely scrutinized , but even ordinary people in @entity51 are suspicious of him , noting his support as a candidate for a hard line against the separatists and his threat to send the army into the city			1
the new president 's message to the outside world will be equally critical , as he walks the tightrope between making @entity1 part of @entity153 -- the dream , still unrealized , that brought thousands onto the streets of @entity104 in february -- and reassuring @entity56 that its interests in the neighborhood will be acknowledged			1
it is a reality he recognized when he told the @entity198 in april : " without a direct dialogue with @entity56 , it will be impossible to create security			2
" creating security seems a long way off			1
on thursday , a car raced out of @entity0 and emptied a mother and her three young children on the main highway to be ferried somewhere safer			0
drawing on a cigarette , the 30 - something driver called @entity147 said they were not his relatives			2
he was just helping them escape			0
" it 's hell down there , " he said , before jumping into his car to return .			2

it seems like eastern @entity1 is half - way through a game of chess , writes @entity2 's @entity220
@entity220 : *civilians* , whatever their allegiance , are suffering the consequences
