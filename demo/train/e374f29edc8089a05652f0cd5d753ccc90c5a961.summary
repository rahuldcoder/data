@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the latest edition of @entity9 's look at famous soccer fans , @entity4 captain and @entity6 midfielder @entity5 tells all about his favorite team and their bitter rivalry with the @entity13			1
who do you support and why ? in @entity4 my favorite football team is @entity18			1
i played for professional team @entity19 but i always love @entity18 because that 's was the team that i grew up supporting			1
how did you start supporting them ? my elder brother , he made me support @entity18 and used to take me to watch the games			1
that really made me fall in love with the team			0
they had so many good players as well			0
that 's why i fell in love with the club			2
do you remember your first game ? it was @entity18 against @entity13 , the biggest derby game in @entity4 , i went to watch and it was unbelievable ; really , really amazing			1
that was the derby of @entity39 , i think it was probably 1990			2
that is a game that everyone wants to watch			2
it 's like @entity45 versus @entity46 or @entity47			0
it 's a game that you ca n't miss. how are they doing at the moment ? they 're still doing well			1
lots of youngsters ... it 's been generations after generations			0
the generation they have now are more younger players			0
they 're adapting well and doing very well			0
what is the most memorable game from @entity18 you 've seen ? they won the @entity66 in 1995			1
it was the first team in @entity4 to win such a tournament			0
that tournament is the toughest tournament to play ... and they did extremely well , they won the cup			2
that really stands out for me			0
is @entity13 the team you love to hate ? not that i do hate @entity13 but as they are the arch rivals to @entity18 , i tend to have a soft spot for @entity18 but not for @entity13			1
i would go back to @entity4 and play for @entity13 to be fair but i do n't hate them , they are really professional			2
but between @entity18 and @entity13 , i would always choose @entity18			1
would you play for @entity18 ? has that opportunity come up ? i have been so fortunate to sit down with the owner of @entity18 and he said , " look the moment you retire from your football in @entity82 make sure you come down to @entity18 " -- so it 's an opportunity that is there for me			1
i am an ambassador for " education -- one goal for all " and i spoke to him at the launch two months ago at the @entity88 and that 's when we had a chat			0
he 's a really respectable person in @entity4 and him saying that meant a lot to me .			0

@entity5 grew up watching @entity18 with his brother
the first game he saw was the derby match between @entity18 and @entity13
his *proudest* moment supporting the club is when they won the @entity66
