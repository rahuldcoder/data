@entity0 -- just before @entity3 security forces launched a large - scale military operation in the southern town of @entity6 in the early hours of april 25 , the commander of the 35th @entity8 , @entity9			1
gen. @entity10 , allegedly gathered his troops and explained their mission			0
nobody will ask you to explain , " the brigadier said , according to " @entity18 , " one of the many defectors i have interviewed in the last months			2
@entity22 explained to me that normally the troops were supposed to save bullets , but this time it was different			0
" the commander said to use as many bullets as we wanted			0
" over the next four days , security forces in @entity6 killed around 200 people ( @entity31 documented the abuses at the time by interviewing victims and witnesses ) and arrested thousands , subjecting many to beatings and torture			1
since then , @entity22 and more than 60 other defectors from @entity3 's military and intelligence agencies have given us crucial information about who was responsible for abuses across the country			1
they provided consistent accounts of officers giving similar orders to military units all over @entity3 , at different times			1
the orders were to stop the protests " by all means necessary			0
" in many cases , they said , officers gave orders to fire directly at protesters			0
the defectors told us that some soldiers reacted by throwing away their weapons and making a run for it			1
others aimed above the protesters ' heads or to the ground			0
eight defectors told us that they saw officers and intelligence agents killing soldiers who disobeyed orders			2
others were detained and tortured			0
we are not publishing the defectors ' names and locations to protect them and their families			0
all these statements demolish president @entity81 's claim that the bloodshed is the result of a few rogue commanders getting overly enthusiastic on crowd control			2
the defectors ' testimonies paint a horrific picture of a widespread and systematic crackdown against demonstrators : torture , arbitrary arrests and a " shoot to kill " policy that clearly amount to crimes against humanity			2
@entity96 and his allies have sought to portray the protesters as " armed gangs sponsored from abroad			0
" in more than nine months of investigations in @entity3 , we have documented episodes of fighting , and attacks on security forces by armed defectors have increased			1
but the vast majority of protests that we documented were nonviolent , and the government 's use of force was clearly excessive compared with any threat facing troops			0
the @entity3 leadership has so far gotten away with murder , in part because the @entity117 government , one of @entity81 's staunchest allies , has blocked action on @entity3 at the @entity121 and continues to supply @entity3 with arms			1
the @entity3 whom i interviewed were well aware of @entity117 's obstructionist position			1
as @entity126 , a former officer , was serving tea during our interview , he suddenly stopped and looked at me with suspicion			0
" i heard you are @entity117 -- if you say that you support their position on @entity3 , you wo n't get any tea ! " he was joking , of course , but his anger at @entity117 was real			1
since @entity117 blocked @entity121 action in october , @entity3 security forces have killed more than 2,000 people , according to the @entity121 high commissioner for human rights , @entity139			1
@entity117 's continued obstruction sends a signal to the @entity3 government that it can continue its violent crackdown with impunity			1
it is difficult to conduct human rights investigations on @entity3 , since the government has barred most journalists , human rights monitors and even a @entity121 commission of inquiry			1
but it is not impossible			0
i managed to enter @entity3 and speak safely with victims there , and we continue to interview witnesses in neighboring countries			2
we 've spoken to hundreds of @entity3 with firsthand knowledge of abuses			2
and in a report @entity31 released thursday , we 're naming 74 commanders , from generals to colonels to captains , who allegedly ordered , authorized or condoned the abuses			0
but responsibility for these crimes does not stop with the commanders on the ground			0
under international criminal law , @entity81 , as commander in chief of all forces in @entity3 , bears responsibility for the most serious crimes committed by his forces -- even if he did not order them -- to the extent that he knew or should have known about the abuses and failed to prevent them			1
given the widespread public and international criticism of the abuses , it would be incredible for @entity81 to argue that he did not know			2
@entity139 told the @entity121 this week that the death toll in @entity3 tops 5,000 , including 300 children killed			1
@entity22 's commander may have told his troops that " nobody will ask you to explain , " but he was wrong			0
it 's time for the @entity121 to act : to impose an arms embargo on @entity3 , to apply targeted sanctions to @entity81 and his circle of cronies , and , most important , to refer @entity3 to the @entity189 in the @entity190			1
that is where @entity10 , his fellow commanders and his bosses will have to explain themselves and where their many victims will receive justice			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

@entity200 : defectors say @entity3 military told them to use " heavy shooting " in @entity6 attack
she says @entity81 must take responsibility for killings , torture reported by defectors
she says @entity117 has helped block @entity121 action
@entity217 : @entity3 must face arms embargo , sanctions , referral to @entity189
