editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity9 ) -- as well as going to exotic places like @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , @entity9 also makes films in our @entity20 office 's beloved @entity27			1
the latest one was made by myself and a young filmmaker called @entity32			0
@entity32 's father is @entity34 , who 's made films like " @entity36 , " starring @entity37			0
in spring of last year we discovered that the small @entity40 city of @entity41 had recorded an 180 percent rise in registered heroin users			1
this happened in just four years , with young people making up the bulk of the increase			1
it used to be one of the biggest ports in the world , but when @entity54 helped bring about the end of heavy industry in @entity27 , the social implications for places like @entity41 were dire			1
funnily enough , it was @entity54 who signed off on a program that meant heroin addicts would be given access to free , sterile needles			1
this was after she 'd closed down the mines , docks , and factories			0
mass unemployment and heroin addiction have always made fine bedfellows			2
see the rest of @entity72 and so we went to @entity41 and lived with a gang of young addicts for a few months and found out just why addiction to heroin in @entity27 continues to rise at such an alarming rate			1
we found out about love , death , the organized sexual abuse of children and the collapse of the family			1
we stumbled into a race riot , met old sailors , and listened to a wonderful @entity88 male choir			0
we learned about why dragging yourself out of addiction is such a struggle , especially if you 're a teenager who 's the product of two generations of heroin addicts and whose great - grandfathers were miners , sailors , and steelworkers			2
mainly , though , we filmed the young people from @entity41 who make up the statistics about drug use in modern @entity27			2
the poor young souls in tattered clothes you cross the street to avoid ? this film is all about them			0
we called it @entity72 .			0

the city of @entity41 saw a 180 percent increase in heroin use in just four years
a @entity9 crew followed a group of addicts for a *firsthand* look at the *epidemic*
the addicts ' stories reveal organized sexual abuse of children and collapse of family
