@entity0 -- although @entity3 appears on track to win the best actor @entity6 next month , he suggests his win at the @entity8 may actually hurt his chances			1
" there 's a good chance i wo n't , " @entity3 said backstage at the @entity10			1
his riveting portrayal of @entity14 in @entity16 's " @entity15 " has been honored with the @entity18 and @entity10 best actor awards			2
while those awards are often predictive of the @entity6 best actor winner , @entity3 is downplaying his chances			1
" i think members of the @entity6 love surprises , so the worst thing that can happen to you is some kind of expectations , " he said			1
" i think they 'd probably be delighted if it was anybody else			2
" day - @entity3 would be the first male actor to win three best actor @entity6			1
he won previously for " @entity30 " in 1989 and " @entity31 " in 2007			2
' @entity32 ' glows other @entity6 races grew murkier with sunday 's @entity10 awards , including for best picture			1
while " @entity15 " might have been a favorite at the start of @entity42 's awards season , its prospects of taking the top @entity6 honor were dimmed with @entity44 's " @entity32 " winning the @entity10 best film award , just two weeks after taking the @entity18			1
" there was absolutely no way that i thought we 'd win this award , " @entity44 said backstage sunday			1
@entity44 directed and starred in " @entity32 , " a movie centered on the 1979 @entity51 hostage crisis			1
while his film now appears to be a frontrunner for the best picture @entity6 , @entity44 was not nominated for best director			1
the best film and best director @entity6 usually go hand in hand			1
" i did n't get nominated as a director and i thought ' well , okay , that 's that , ' you know , and then i remembered i was nominated as a producer which is pretty exciting , " @entity44 said			1
" so i 've kind of gone at it with that approach			0
i do n't know what 's going to happen			0
who knows ? nothing may happen , but it 's a wonderful opportunity to be on the ride and i 'm really excited			2
" @entity71 's post-oscar playbook @entity72 was ill when she won a best actress in a comedy film at the @entity18 two weeks ago , but she told reporters backstage sunday that she 's feeling a lot better thanks to a " lot of medication " and a better inhaler			1
@entity71 glowed after she was handed the best actress @entity10 for her role in " @entity83			0
" at just 22 , @entity71 is the youngest person ever to have been nominated twice for a best actress @entity6 , the first being in 2010 for " @entity85			1
" asked backstage what she might say to a 14 - year - old @entity72 if she could talk to her , she said she would never reveal her future success			1
" i would 've said , ' you 're going fail , so do n't be so full of yourself			0
' " @entity71 has plans to relax after the @entity42 awards season ends with the @entity6 next month			1
" i 'm going to go to an island somewhere and not telling anyone where i 'm going			1
" @entity98 's all - in approach @entity98 carried home two @entity10 actor awards sunday , one for film and another for television work			1
his role as a @entity105 agent in " @entity32 " gave him part of that film 's ensemble @entity10 award			2
he was also handed the best actor in a tv drama for " @entity111 , " in which he plays a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a meth manufacturer			0
backstage , @entity98 said he tries to discourage young actors , telling them a career takes " total dedication " to succeed			1
" i say that if you can be happy doing something else , anything else , go do that , go do that , " @entity98 said			1
" because in order to be an actor you need to totally commit			0
absolutely , you ca n't put your big toe in			2
" when i was 22 years old , i said this is what i 'm going to do			2
if it means that when i 'm 40 or 50 or 60 i 'm sharing an apartment with someone and sleeping on a couch , that 's what i 'm going to do			2
so , it was all in			0
i had no backup plan			0
and in a way , it makes you hungrier and more aggressive to find those projects and to keep your eye on the prize			0
" @entity144 's future television comedy pioneer @entity145 , who was given @entity10 's @entity147 sunday , told reporters backstage that his secret to success was luck			0
" i 've been so lucky , " @entity145 , 87 , said			0
" @entity152 has a lot to do with it , being in the right place at the right time , having someone seeing you when you happen to be particularly good			0
" @entity144 , who won the tv comedy actress @entity10 for a fourth time sunday , said backstage that she will be busy making movies with the end of " @entity161 " this month			0
@entity144 flies to @entity162 in march to make a @entity164 movie , followed by a film with @entity166 -- " @entity167 " -- this summer , she said backstage			0
her television career is not over though			0
@entity144 has a deal with @entity170 to develop new shows , she said			0
@entity144 , who is known for a dead - on impression of @entity173 , praised @entity175 's portrayal of the former @entity177 vice presidential nominee in @entity179 's " @entity178			0
" @entity175 was given the best actress in a tv movie or miniseries @entity10			0
" i thought @entity175 was incredible , " @entity144 said			2
" she really disappeared into the character			0
