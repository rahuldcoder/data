-- @entity2 's government on tuesday appealed a request from the @entity4 to hand over @entity5 , saying it should be given more time to make its own case			1
@entity5 , son of deposed strongman @entity7 , was facing an arrest warrant from the @entity4 for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture , and the court is still seeking to prosecute him			1
officials with the @entity4 , based at @entity15 in the @entity16 , said thursday that @entity2 must make arrangements to hand him over immediately			2
he has been held in the @entity2 city of @entity19 since his capture in november			0
but the @entity2 government said in its appeal filing tuesday that legally , the @entity4 was wrong to turn down its request for a postponement to surrender @entity5			1
@entity2 authorities intend to file a challenge to the @entity4 case , which should be considered before it 's decided when he must be handed over , the appeal document says			1
the @entity2 government wants to prosecute @entity5 itself , as it " regards the trial of @entity5 and @entity33 as a matter of the highest national importance , not only in bringing justice for the @entity2 people but also in demonstrating that the new @entity2 justice system is capable of conducting fair trials ( that meet all applicable international standards ) in complex cases , " it says			2
@entity42 , who was @entity2 's chief of intelligence under the @entity5 regime , is wanted by both the @entity4 and the @entity2 government			1
he was arrested in @entity46 last month			0
the appeal document also seeks to answer @entity4 concerns about @entity5 's well - being , saying the government " has expended considerable resources in order to ensure the safe and secure temporary custody " of @entity5 in @entity19 and is negotiating to bring him to the capital , where facilities would be better			1
@entity4 defense lawyers said last week that the son of @entity2 's deposed leader has been mistreated and " physically attacked " since his capture			1
@entity5 is in a " legal black hole , " held for 139 days in " total isolation " except for visits from officials , his @entity4 - appointed defense said in a strongly worded statement			2
he also suffers dental pain because he has n't had treatment , and @entity2 authorities have given him nothing to remedy the pain , lawyers @entity66 and @entity68 said			1
" at no point have the @entity2 authorities been legally justified in their failure to surrender him to the @entity4 , " the lawyers said			1
" the brutal death of @entity7 deprived the @entity2 people of their right to justice and their right to the truth			2
it would be a travesty for the prospects of a free and fair @entity2 state if the same were to occur to his son , " they said			0
@entity66 said @entity5 had also been given misleading information about the severity of the allegations against him			0
@entity4 prosecutor @entity91 said it is possible that the court will allow @entity2 to proceed with its case if the @entity2 explain their plans			2
" according to the rules , @entity2 has the primacy to prosecute @entity5 , so if they present this to the @entity4 judges , probably they will get an approval , " @entity91 said thursday			1
" that 's the system			0
the system is the primacy for the national judges			0
" @entity107 called on @entity2 to hand over @entity5 at once in light of the @entity4 statement			1
" an unfair trial before a @entity2 court where the accused could face the death penalty is no way to guarantee justice and accountability , " the rights group said			0
@entity107 said @entity2 did not have a functioning court system and the country was " unable to conduct effective investigations , " so " the @entity4 will be crucial in delivering accountability in @entity2			2
" @entity2 and the @entity4 have been going back and forth since his capture about where @entity5 , once his father 's heir apparent , will be tried			1
after visiting @entity5 in custody last year , @entity125 said that he should have a lawyer			0
but interior minister @entity128 implied in february that he had not asked for one			0
" he may have a lawyer if he asks for a lawyer , " the interior minister told @entity0			0
" @entity5 demand a lawyer , then a lawyer would be provided			0
" @entity7 died after his capture by opposition forces last october			0
@entity0 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 is wrong to ask for @entity5 's surrender , @entity2 says
@entity2 authorities want to try the son of late strongman @entity7 in @entity2
@entity4 defense lawyers say @entity5 has been mistreated and should be handed over now
@entity2 and the @entity4 have been *arguing* over his case since his arrest last november
