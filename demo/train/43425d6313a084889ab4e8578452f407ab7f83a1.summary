-- former @entity1 and outspoken same - sex marriage supporter @entity2 said monday he is encouraged the @entity5 team is looking into his claims that he was released in may because he is an @entity7 activist			1
@entity2 told @entity0 's @entity8 360 in his first television interview since being kicked off the team that he is confident an investigation will uncover the truth			1
over the past couple of years , the former punter has become known for his gay - rights activism , and in an article published thursday on the website @entity17 he claimed he was fired by " two cowards and a @entity19 " for his stance and not entirely for his performance on the field			1
" i do n't have anything against the @entity1 organization itself			0
i had eight wonderful years with the @entity1 , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" i had a problem with three individual people within the @entity1 , and the fact remains is that i did everything my coaches wanted me to do ( on the field )			0
... no one ever told me that i was n't doing what i was supposed to do			0
" the only thing that changed from year 8 to when i got cut is that i started speaking out on same - sex rights			2
" the three individuals @entity2 referred to are @entity36 , the @entity1 special teams coach ; former head coach @entity38 and @entity1 general manager @entity39			1
@entity36 , the man @entity2 labeled a " bigot , " denied the former player 's claim in a statement to the @entity45 of @entity46			1
@entity2 : an openly gay player in the @entity5 is not a distraction " i want to be clear that i do not tolerate discrimination of any type and am respectful of all individuals ... the comments today have not only attacked my character and insulted my professionalism , but they have also impacted my family , " said the coach , who has been with the team for two of his 11 years in the @entity5			1
@entity2 said that he decided when he began to work with @entity59 was that he was n't going to back down from people who told him to keep his views to himself			1
he never thought about stopping even after @entity38 requested he stop speaking out			0
when football , same - sex marriage and politics collide " i said , ' well , no. that 's not the right thing to do			0
we are all @entity68 citizens			0
we all deserve to live our lives free of oppression , ' " @entity2 told @entity0			2
the @entity1 said in a statement thursday : " any notion that @entity2 was released from our football team due to his stance on marriage equality is entirely inaccurate and inconsistent with team policy			1
@entity2 was released strictly based on his football performance			2
" in his final season , @entity2 , 31 , ranked 17th among punters in the 32 - team league , averaging 39.7 net yards per punt			1
this season , the @entity1 ' @entity82 , a fifth - round draft pick , was 18th with a 39.2 yard average			0
are athletes who speak their minds out of bounds ? @entity2 said that after the @entity1 drafted @entity82 in april he knew he was done with the team so he kept notes of his interactions with team officials			1
" i realized i need to get all this stuff down now while it 's fresh and make sure i have it because this is a story i would like to tell later , " he said			0
as a result of telling his story in the @entity17 article , @entity2 believes his time in the @entity5 is over			1
after he was cut , he had a tryout with the @entity101 but did n't get the job			2
he said speaking publicly about team matters was , in this case , like throwing a stick of dynamite on a bridge -- one that can never be crossed again			2
but he thinks the @entity1 investigation will reveal the truth , if his former teammates are given the opportunity to maintain anonymity when they are interviewed about what they witnessed			2
he likely wo n't sue the team , he said , reiterating that he believes it was @entity36 , @entity38 and @entity39 that moved to get rid of him			0
and the @entity1 have " a good track record of getting to the truth , " he said			0
the team said friday the investigation in under way and the two attorneys heading the probe will interview current and former members of the organization			0
opinion : pro sports , still homophobic in 2014 @entity131 's @entity130 contributed to this story .			0
