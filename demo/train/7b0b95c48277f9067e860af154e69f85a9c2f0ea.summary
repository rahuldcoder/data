victims , clockwise : @entity9 , 23 , @entity10 , 26 , @entity11 , 17 and @entity12 , 26			2
her father , @entity13 , recently posted a plea on a web site established in september by the @entity16 to draw attention to the killing of his daughter and the deaths of seven other women in the area			1
police say the slayings may be linked			1
" we love and miss her , " the father 's message said			2
" she was a loving mother , wife and daughter			2
if you have any information about her death , please let someone know			2
" there have been eight killings in four years in a small town that averages one homicide a year			2
the victims ' bodies were dumped on the outskirts of @entity6 -- population 10,546 -- west of @entity46 , @entity7			1
they 're asking themselves , " is there a serial killer among us ? " that seems likely , authorities say			1
" based on an analysis of the investigation thus far , we believe the homicides may be linked to a common offender , " sheriff @entity54 said in a recent news release			1
the victims ranged in age from 17 to 30 and had similar lifestyles			2
they were drug abusers who in some cases resorted to prostitution , " trading sex for drugs , " @entity54 said			1
the throats of two of the victims were slit and the others died " from some sort of asphyxiation , according to the coroner 's office , " he said			2
the bodies of all but two of the victims were either nude or partially nude , the sheriff said , but the coroner 's office has not determined whether any were sexually assaulted			1
one month after @entity13 ' death , the body of @entity84 , 30 , was found in a drainage canal			1
two young women were killed in 2007 , @entity88 , 21 , and @entity10 , 26			1

" how can there not be anything ? " he asked			2
" i want justice , not just for my family , but for the families of all the girls			0
we live in fear that someone else is going to get killed			0
" but @entity54 said his department and investigators from the neighboring parishes of @entity104 and @entity105 , the state attorney general 's office , the @entity107 and the @entity108 are doing everything they can			1
" this investigation is intense , " he said			0

your smile is forever a reminder of how special you are			0
it has almost been a year , but it seems like yesterday that you were taken from us			0
if anyone has any information on my daughter 's death , please come forward			0
without closure , not knowing who could have done this is very frightening			0
i pray every day that @entity140 will give the task force what they need to solve these cases			0
" in the most recent case , the body of @entity12 , 26 , was found in @entity104 , off @entity146 , in august			1
@entity54 believes this represented a change in the killer 's modus operandi			1
the bodies of all the previous victims were left on the side of smaller , rural roads			0
" it 's likely whoever 's responsible changed behavior because of increased attention in the public and the media , " he said			0
investigators think the offender has significant ties to @entity164 and is known to its residents , because he has demonstrated a strong familiarity with the area , @entity54 said			1
of the victims , the sheriff said , " all of these young ladies had substance abuse problems and would go anywhere to fulfill their addictions			1
" but he said he stopped referring to their " high - risk lifestyle " after the family of one of the victims expressed outrage and accused his department of not caring about the women			1
" @entity6 and @entity164 is hurting and grieving the deaths of eight women since 2005 , " the sheriff said			1
" the investigative team continues to pray for @entity1 , @entity84 , @entity88 , @entity10 , [ @entity186 ] ' @entity187 , ' [ @entity119 ] @entity188 , @entity11 , and @entity12 and your families			0
" he encouraged anyone with information to visit the site , www.jeffdaviscrimes.net , or contact the task force at 337 - 824 - 6662			2
in the meantime , the families continue to wait for news			0
@entity199 , @entity121 's mother , has distributed more than 1,200 fliers in the community urging everyone to attend an october 17 prayer vigil at @entity205			0
" it 's called @entity207 in @entity208 , " she said			0
" everyone is invited to pray for the victims and their families			0
it 's a healing for our community			0
" " we try to shoulder each other up , " said @entity10 , @entity215 's brother			0
" it 's not the time to be quiet			0
it 's time to say ' enough is enough			0
