-- @entity1 in @entity2 used to be a site to reckon with			1
twenty years ago , it ranked as the sixth largest saltwater lake in the world , and the largest in the @entity7			1
tourists would revel in the lake 's buoyancy ( like the @entity12 , the salt level made it impossible to sink ) , and the flocks of flamingos , pelicans and yellow deer that once inhabited the surrounding areas			2
today , @entity19 is a shadow of its former self			0
decades of poor water management , aggressive agricultural policies and drought have rendered it almost completely dried up ( according to the @entity27 , the lake has shrunk by two - thirds since 1997 )			1
rusted boats lay abandoned in what is now essentially a giant salt flat			0
the tourists are long gone , as are many of the animals that once called the lake home			0
" it 's like seeing a scene from a different planet			0
i saw caterpillars and bobcats taking salt from the dead body of the lake , " recalls @entity41 , the @entity42 resident coordinator in @entity2			1
" it 's a testament to how rapidly we can break something			0
" it 's a problem that president @entity52 is aware of , and one he wants to fix			1
last month , he agreed to spend $ 500 million in the first year alone of a ten - year recovery plan ( the total bill is $ 5 billion )			1
" if the lake dries up , this kind of threat will not be comparable to any other threat , " he said in a public statement in january			2
it 's not an overblown statement			0
according to experts , @entity2 is on the brink of a water crisis			1
" in the year 1956 , the per capita water available in @entity2 was 7,000 cubic meters			2
today , it is 1,900 cubic meters			0
in the year 2020 , it is likely to be only 1,300 cubic meters , " says @entity41			0
the estimates fall far short of the 30 million cubic meters he believes will be needed to accommodate the burgeoning population -- which could reach 90 million in the next decade			0
shortages are cited throughout the country , not just at @entity1 , but in the @entity73 in the east of the country -- a one - time oasis surrounded by fishing villages that has since dried up			2
in 2012 alone , the @entity79 water crisis sent 600,000 environmental refugees into the north of the country			1
@entity41 worries that as water shortages become the norm , not only will @entity2 face repercussions to the economy and public health , but that it will start to have a knock - on effect on the @entity7 as a whole			1
" people are vulnerable when they migrate			0
when they come crashing into someone else 's neighborhood , they become a threat to those people 's economic security			2
add in ethnic or linguistic differences , and that can be a real source of conflict , " he says			0
a new @entity2 ? @entity2 is doing more than throwing money at the problem			2
in march , @entity2 's @entity103 , together with the @entity27 , held a conference with hundreds of international experts on how to solve @entity2 's water shortage problem , and ultimately approved 24 separate projects			1
" when @entity52 took power , in the first government meeting , he ordered the formation of a special group to save @entity19 and the other dying wetlands , " recalls @entity108 , a professor at the @entity110 and @entity109 at @entity111 , and a member of the steering committee of the @entity1 restoration program			1
the mission to save the lake is complex , and @entity108 admits that even in ten years , it will only restore @entity1 to half its original size			1
" no single measure can help the lake			0
lots of things have to be done at the same time , " he says			0
the influx of money and manpower demonstrates a sizable shift in how the new administration is addressing the problem -- partly , in that they 're willing to address it at all			0
thus far , @entity2 's environmental record has been pretty poor			1
the country is the world 's ninth top producer of greenhouse gasses , according to according to the @entity142 , and is home to the world 's eighth most polluted city			1
" the past government would say we needed to save the lake , and would even form a national committee and ministers would come together , but there was never a budget , and without a budget , you ca n't do anything , " says @entity108			2
" this new government is very different			0
they also approved a large amount of money , so it can really help save the lake			2

@entity1 was once one of the world 's largest lakes
over the last 20 years it has almost completely dried up
@entity2 's water crisis puts security , the economy and public health at risk
president @entity52 has committed $ 5 billion to save the lake
