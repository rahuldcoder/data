" i think @entity1 is a man whose heart was in the right place , but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods , and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done , " she said			1

" i think @entity1 got in a little bit too deep , which he should n't have been there			2
but @entity10 decided that he was n't going to let him scare him ... and i think @entity10 got mad and attacked him , " she said			2
@entity1 felt his life was in danger before shooting @entity10 , and it was his voice that was heard screaming for help in 911 calls , the juror said she believes			1
