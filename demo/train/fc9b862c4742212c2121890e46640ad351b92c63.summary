-- the height of luxury -- or a vulgar monstrosity ? to its owner , this 15 - meter , @entity5 - inspired speedboat is the apex of nautical engineering			1
a sleek , innovative , gutsy vessel worthy of its $ 1.1 million price tag			1
when @entity13 turned up at the @entity14 with his banana - yellow beauties in tow -- the boat and the $ 750,000 car it resembles -- a small crowd quickly gathered around			1
" this is the best boat you can buy -- it 's the @entity5 of boats , " says the 48 - year - old automobile and restaurant mogul from @entity23 , @entity24			1
" the response we 've had ... letters , emails			2
if you do a @entity35 search today there are 14,000 pages on it already -- and the boat 's never even been in the water			2
" however , not everyone is impressed by the idea of a high - performance sports car dressed up as a superyacht			1
to @entity45 , former presenter of @entity47 tv show " @entity48 , " the @entity5 boat is a tasteless display of wealth that screams : " i 'm rich and bored			1
" @entity45 quickly moves into fourth gear with his analysis			0
" and that 's really sad			0
anybody who 's got that amount of money that they need to go and commission a special boat to keep them entertained -- i think it 's nuts , " he says			0
" the key with these people is they want to be different , and they want to be separate , and they want to be distinctive -- and that impulse throws good taste , and reason , and rationale out the window			0
" rags to riches what really sets @entity13 apart is not his wealth or supercar yachts -- it 's the fact that more than 25 years ago he was penniless and living on the streets of @entity74			1
" i was a drug addict , on cocaine and crack , " says the father - of - one , who today owns a truck repair company , a car paintwork group , and a chain of hamburger restaurants			2
" i lived in a halfway house for about a year			0
i really started with nothing and no help			0
and probably in fear of ever going back there , it 's kept me motivated to this day			0
" i work really hard , i make a good living , and all the things i did n't have for a long time , well now i can do it			0
" billionaire bling with his supercar yacht he has done it -- and then some			1
" like anybody that likes expensive things , it 's definitely an ego thing , " says @entity13 , who also commissioned a @entity96 - style vessel in 2007			1
" maybe it 's partially boredom			0
i 'm one of those people that always has to have to have a project -- and i 've been thinking about doing the @entity5 boat for years			1
" the flashy vessel 's engine package costs $ 400,000 , a " homage " to his beloved @entity5 car -- one of two he owns			1
@entity13 is not the only one with an ego in overdrive , by the sounds of it			0
" the people that own these boats , already own the vehicles , " says @entity116 , owner of @entity117 , which as well as the @entity5 and @entity96 has also sold @entity120 and @entity121 - inspired yachts to other millionaires			1
" nobody wants a boat to resemble a car that they ca n't afford			0
" daring design once someone decides they want a supercar yacht , it 's up to engineers at @entity137 to bring it to life , drawing up designs that take the most iconic features of the luxury automobile and transferring them to a working boat , capable of traveling 300 kilometers per hour			1
" in the case of the @entity5 , one of the most noticeable and sought - after features is the beautiful carbon - fiber scoops on the side of the car , " says @entity116			1
" they 're quite pronounced and we wanted to make sure we used them in the design -- along with the exotic taillights and headlights , which are different to a normal car			0
" sit in the driver 's seat and the plush leather interior could easily be mistaken for the four - wheeled variety			2
the distinctive yellow paintwork is also identical , and seeing the two super vehicles together is a bit like witnessing a surreal @entity5 festival for enthusiasts			1
a question of taste there 's no denying this is a rare and expensive yacht			2
but it 's not for @entity45			0
" if i was wealthy enough to go down the boat route , i would buy myself a lovely old period @entity175 motorboat , " he says , referring to the vintage @entity172 wooden vessel			2
" when you start making bright yellow @entity5 speedboats , i think it means you are firmly detached from reality , " he says by phone , having just driven through @entity177 in his own @entity178 -- a supercar worth Â £ 175,000 ( $ 290,000 ) and capable of doing 300 kph			1
while @entity184 ponders the meaning of taste , @entity13 is getting his kicks from the adrenalin of driving one of these supercar yachts -- " like nothing else in the world , " is how he puts it			2
when he first took his @entity96 version on the water , he felt like he was flying			0
" i 'm sure my wife @entity196 would prefer if i put a lot more money in the bank , " he says			0
" but this is just me			0
" " i make a good living , i give to charity , and i like buying these kinds of things			0

*behold* the supercar yacht , *pimped* - up boats inspired by luxury vehicles
