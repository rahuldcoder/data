-- at first glance , " @entity5 " might seem like an episode of " hoarders , " @entity4 - style			1
the documentary film opens after an elderly woman dies in @entity8			2
her grandchildren assemble to clean out her apartment , packed with dusty books , vintage clothing ( dozens of pairs of fancy gloves , for instance ) , enough purses to stock a department store , jewelry , mementoes and closets full of knickknacks			2
but buried among the detritus they chance upon something remarkable -- mysterious papers linking the grandparents to an important @entity27 figure			2
how could such ardent @entity28 , who left their native @entity30 in the early 1930s , have been involved with an @entity32 official like @entity33 ? " the film developed as a detective story , " says @entity4 director @entity34 , grandson of @entity35 , the woman who owned the flat			1
of all his family members , only @entity34 seemed driven to uncover the secrets of his family 's past			1
the mystery " i discovered very strange newspapers in my grandparents ' flat , " he says			2
" a newspaper with a swastika on it , @entity27 newspaper , that turns out to be travelogues by a very famous @entity27 writer ( @entity33 ) that describes a journey to @entity56			0
what i found out was this journey , the @entity27 ( @entity33 ) and his wife were accompanied by my grandparents , " @entity34 told @entity0			1
it was a unique period in which , says @entity34 , " nazis and @entity28 shared the same aim : both of them wanted the @entity65 to leave @entity30 and settle in @entity56			1
" the plot thickens the mystery of the newspapers prompted @entity34 to dig deeper			1
additional documents , photos and letters pointed to only one conclusion -- @entity35 and her husband @entity73 were not simply acquainted with @entity33 and his wife -- they had become the warmest of friends			0
this became all the harder for @entity34 to digest when he learned more about von @entity79 : he was no mere travel writer , but the head of the @entity27 's @entity81 in the early 1930s			1
in that capacity @entity33 is said to have recruited an up - and - coming member of the party -- @entity85			0
a twist in the tale @entity34 's investigation took him to @entity30 , where he tracked down @entity33 's daughter , @entity89 , who proved receptive to his efforts to shed light on their families ' intersecting past			1
she helped him confirm something that may sound astonishing : after the war -- a conflict that claimed the lives of millions of @entity65 , including @entity35 's own mother -- @entity35 and her husband remained friends with the @entity102			0
this discovery left @entity105 feeling irritated and angry , he told @entity0 , and forced him to revise the idealized view he held as a young boy of his grandparents			2
" i think as a grandchild you are not really used to thinking about your grandparents as human beings , " @entity34 says			1
" they 're grandparents ; they need to think about you ! " " then for five years i thought about their life , motivations and strangely -- even now they 're gone , after their death -- i feel much closer to them			2
i saw them not just as the heroes i had imagined ( during his childhood ) , but as human beings with very ( conflicted ) feelings inside			0
now i can feel sorry for them			0
i can feel compassion and also anger			0
when you are finally feeling those complex emotions inside i think i become closer to my grandparents			2
" " @entity5 " does n't end there			1
@entity34 continued to investigate , and what he found would confront him with an ethical dilemma			1
the tangled web what became of @entity33 after the war ? like many ex-nazis , he managed to re-enter civilian life ( at one point he even sought assistance from @entity148 to ease his transition )			0
he worked for @entity150 in @entity30 , concealing the true extent of his pre-war activities			0
the secret of his real position within the @entity27 hierarchy remained buried in @entity157 archives , until @entity34 uncovered it			1
having destroyed the fiction @entity33 promoted -- that he had split with the @entity160 before the war -- goldfinger then faced a difficult decision : whether to share what he had learned with von @entity33 's daughter , @entity89			1
" morally i felt i had no alternative			0
i can not say -- as my mother did in the film -- ' it 's not our business			0
' ( i decided ) i must tell @entity89 what i know			0
i can not anymore hide the secrets , so it was a very tough moment and very hard to understand how to do it			0
" ultimate mysteries " my family was surprised when they first saw the film , " @entity34 told @entity0			1
" my siblings and especially my mother were not so interested in the history of my family , of our family , " he says			0
the film touches on the ultimate and universal mysteries of identity , memory and family			0
why was @entity34 's mother so lacking in curiosity about her family 's past ? why did @entity34 feel compelled to investigate the family mystery while his siblings evinced so little interest ? how and why did @entity89 shield herself from the truth about her @entity27 father ? for some mysteries there are answers			1
for others , alas , there are not .			0

@entity4 director @entity34 was *shocked* by what he found out about his grandparents
his quest became the award *winning* documentary " @entity5 "
he says he faced a difficult decision with the project
