@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 deployed stealth fighter jets to @entity1 on sunday as part of ongoing joint military exercises between the two countries , a senior @entity4 defense official said			1
the @entity9 were sent to the main @entity4 @entity10 in @entity1 amid spiking tensions on the @entity12			1
the @entity4 military command in @entity1 said they were deployed to support air drills as part of the annual @entity18 training exercises , which are carried out in accordance with the armistice that put an end to armed hostilities in 1953			1
@entity23 has been ramping up its rhetoric and military show of force in response to the annual joint military exercises , declaring the armistice invalid on march 11 , 10 days after @entity18 began			1
it is something @entity31 has done before during heightened tensions			0
@entity23 's threat : five things to know the @entity4 ' participation in @entity18 is intended to demonstrate the country 's " commitment to stability and security in the @entity39 , " the @entity4 military command in @entity1 said in a statement that also urged @entity23 to tone down its rhetoric			1
" the ( @entity23 ) will achieve nothing by threats or provocations , which will only further isolate @entity23 and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in @entity49 , " the statement said			2
" the @entity23 leadership is urged to heed president @entity52 's call to choose the path of peace and come into compliance with its international obligations			2
" @entity23 's hot rhetoric the deployment follows fresh insults over the weekend from @entity31 's propaganda machine comparing the @entity4 mainland with a " boiled pumpkin , " unable to endure an attack from a foreign foe , the state - run @entity58 reported			1
@entity23 , on the other hand , could withstand an offensive from the outside , the report said , thanks to shelters that the government had built around the country			2
but the @entity74 and the @entity1 government have said it 's nothing new			1
" we have no indications at this point that it 's anything more than warmongering rhetoric , " a senior @entity74 official said late friday			2
the official was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named			0
the @entity85 , which advises the @entity4 president on matters of war , struck a similar chord , saying @entity90 finds @entity23 's statements " unconstructive " and is taking the threats seriously			1
" but , we would also note that @entity23 has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats , and today 's announcement follows that familiar pattern , " said @entity93 , a spokeswoman for the security council			1
the @entity4 will continue to update its capabilities against any military threat from the @entity23 , which includes plans to deploy missile defense systems			1
no , @entity23 ca n't hit @entity104 in an added slap , @entity23 has declared that it had entered a " state of war " with neighboring @entity1 , according to a report saturday from @entity58			1
" the condition , which was neither war nor peace , has ended , " @entity23 's government said in a special statement carried by @entity58			2
saturday 's reports also asserted any conflict " will not be limited to a local war , but develop into an all - out war , a nuclear war			1
" @entity1 president @entity117 on monday issued a warning of her own to @entity31			1
" if there is any provocation against @entity1 and its people , there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations , " she said in a meeting with senior defense and security officials , according to her office			1
analysis : just what is @entity134 up to ? the south : it 's not new @entity1 has not , however , treated its neighbor 's latest threat as imminent danger			2
@entity0 noted scores of its personnel had entered the @entity142 -- a joint economic cooperation zone between the two @entity144 situated on the @entity23 's side of the border -- on saturday morning			2
hundreds more were set to join them later in the day , seeming to suggest both sides were going about business as usual			0
the @entity151 's officials said that @entity23 's threats to shut down the complex earlier saturday were part of the @entity23 's " measures of putting military alert to highest level , " but the @entity151 was taking the @entity23 's words " seriously , " the @entity153 said			1
the threats are n't " beneficial " to the development of the economic zone , the @entity151 's ministry said			0
currently , 310 people work in the industrial complex , the ministry said			0
however , the @entity151 has n't detected any " irregular trend " in the zone , the ministry said			0
@entity31 's declaration it was readying its missiles also did not seem to worry officials in the @entity151			0
" the announcement made by @entity23 is not a new threat , but part of follow - up measures after @entity23 's supreme command 's statement that it will enter the highest military alert " on tuesday , @entity1 's @entity173 said in a statement			1
threats of annihilation normal for @entity1 @entity182 appears to show @entity4 targets a day earlier , the same official @entity23 news agency reported its leader @entity134 had approved a plan to prepare standby rockets to hit @entity4 targets in the @entity189 , including in @entity104 , @entity190 , and @entity1			1
behind @entity23 's heated words about missile strikes , one analyst said , there might not be much mettle			0
" unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among @entity23 's strategic forces , there is little to no chance that it could successfully land a missile on @entity190 , @entity104 or anywhere else outside the @entity12 that @entity4 forces may be stationed , " @entity196 , @entity39 editor of @entity197 , wrote in an opinion column published thursday on @entity2			1
behind the veil : a rare look at life in @entity23 @entity4 official : we 're ' committed ... to peace ' @entity4 defense officials said friday that the @entity23 's bantering is destructive			1
" this is troubling rhetoric that disrupts the prospects for peace on the @entity12 , " the senior official said			0
some observers have suggested that @entity90 is adding to tensions in the region by drawing attention to its displays of military strength on @entity23 's doorstep , such as the flights by the @entity228 stealth bombers			2
defense secretary @entity229 argued against that assertion thursday			0
" we , the @entity4 and @entity1 , have not been involved in provocating anything , " he said			1
" we , over the years , have been engaged with @entity1 on joint exercises			2
the @entity228 flight was part of that			0
" @entity90 and its allies " are committed to a pathway to peace , " @entity237 said			0
" and the @entity23 seem to be headed in a different direction here			0
" opinion : why @entity23 regime is scary @entity31 's allies irked the tense situation has irritated @entity23 's traditional allies , @entity247 and @entity248 , drawing regular calls for restraint on all sides in recent weeks			0
saturday , the @entity252 repeated this admonition			0
" @entity257 expects all parties to exercise as much responsibility and restraint as possible in light of @entity23 's latest statements , " the @entity248 foreign ministry said according to @entity248 state broadcaster @entity255			2
@entity247 , which has expressed frustration over @entity31 's latest nuclear test , also called for calm			0
" we hope relevant parties can work together to turn around the tense situation in the region , " @entity266 spokesman @entity265 said friday , describing peace and stability on the @entity12 as " a joint responsibility			0
" @entity275 's foreign minister @entity274 noted saturday that " @entity278 likely to try to calm things down , " he said on his @entity277 account			0
" but the @entity31 regime is the most militarised , the most authoritarian and the most closed in the world , " @entity274 tweeted			0
@entity4 officials concerned about @entity23 's ' ratcheting up of rhetoric ' tensions have been rising for months tensions escalated on the @entity12 after the @entity23 carried out a long - range rocket launch in december and an underground nuclear test last month , prompting the @entity288 to step up sanctions on the secretive government			1
@entity31 has expressed fury about the sanctions and the annual @entity4 - @entity1 military exercises , due to continue until the end of april			1
the deteriorating relations have killed hopes of reviving multilateral talks over @entity23 's nuclear program for the foreseeable future			2
indeed , @entity31 has declared that the subject is no longer up for discussion			0
