-- the hard - nosed stance taken by mayor @entity2 in the @entity5 teachers ' strike dovetails with the education goals of his former boss , president @entity7 , but observers disagreed monday over how well it serves the city 's schoolchildren			1
critics such as @entity15 professor @entity14 say @entity2 is slavishly following the @entity7 administration 's educational policies to the detriment of children and teachers			1
" it makes teachers look at students as their adversaries , " said @entity14 , who works with public school teachers as part of the @entity23 and is a professor of @entity25 at the university			1
" it makes teachers hate their jobs and it makes students not want to go to schools , because all you do is study for bubble tests , " he said , referring to computer - scored standardized tests			1
but the mayor 's supporters see teachers desperately trying to hold on to their jobs amid a challenging environment that mixes rising calls for accountability with falling budgets			1
" the only negative consequence , if you think about it as negative , is that some people are going to lose their jobs			1
and maybe rightly so , " said @entity51 , ceo of @entity52 , a nonprofit that manages 13 largely @entity54 charter schools in @entity5			1
@entity5 's 30,000 school teachers were in the second day of a strike tuesday after 10 months of negotiations failed to reach a deal			1
@entity2 came out swinging in his fight with the union -- typically a reliable part of the @entity63 base -- saying monday that educators had opted for what he called an unnecessary strike that could endanger the futures of 350,000 children			1
the former @entity7 chief of staff backs @entity71 administrators who want to evaluate teachers in large part based on student performance on standardized tests and maintain the authority of local principals to hire anyone they choose for job openings			2
the question of changing how teachers are evaluated -- for the first time in decades in @entity5 , according to @entity2 -- has emerged as the central issue of the strike			1
and @entity2 's position is straight out of the @entity7 's administration playbook , said @entity14 , who is critical of the mayor 's stance			0
" @entity2 is very faithfully following the strategy for urban school systems outlined in the @entity7 administration 's signature education policy , which is his race - to - the - top initiative , " he said			2
key issues behind the strike the idea is that by rating teachers on student test scores and closing failing schools , bad teachers will be weeded out and students will get a better education , he said			2
the @entity7 initiative attempts to apply a business model to public education , according to @entity14			0
" they 're trying to see if by putting pressure on teachers to raise student test scores , they can reduce the performance gap between schools in poor neighborhoods and schools in more affluent neighborhoods , " he said			2
but the results have brought unintended consequences that may be worse than the putative reforms , @entity14 said			0
schools in danger of closing have cut recess , gym , arts and music , he said , and the atmosphere at many schools has been poisoned			0
" basically , all kids do is study for the test all day , which is the only way you have any chance of teachers keeping their jobs and administrators keeping schools open , " @entity14 said			1
" what the @entity5 teachers have done is say enough is enough , " he said			1
voices of the @entity71 strike @entity51 , the @entity52 ceo , said @entity2 has " done an outstanding job in putting forth a reform agenda for education			0
" when you have change , it 's going to inconvenience people , " he said			2
@entity51 , whose organization manages the @entity52 , dismissed @entity14 's criticism that schools end up doing little but " teaching to the test			0
" " the reality is this , " he said			0
" at some point , we have to be able to assess the progress of children , and we do that through testing			0
" those opposed to the plan " just do n't want to be held accountable to standards , " he said			0
" the only negative consequence , if you think about it as negative , is that some people are going to lose their jobs			1
" the conflict underscores the @entity63 's new openness to changes , such as charter schools and teacher accountability , that labor historically has not supported , said @entity176 , director of the @entity178 's @entity177			1
" you 've got three factors -- labor , new @entity63 , and you 've got no money -- and that , it turns out , is combustible			1
" @entity14 said the policies favored by @entity7 and @entity2 have gained traction among @entity63 because they appear to be a low - risk way to bring in campaign donations from the corporate world			1
@entity187 , @entity7 spar over strike " it makes perfect sense that @entity2 pushes this , because this policy makes money for the @entity63 , " he said			1
" the big funders love it			1
teachers hate it , but teachers do n't have anywhere else to go , right ? they 're not going to go @entity200			1
" " so , if you look at this fairly cynically , you can beat on teachers without undermining the @entity63 base that much and bring in much - needed financing from the corporate sector			1
@entity2 is at the forefront of both , " he said			0
he called teachers " collateral damage to the @entity63 's fundraising strategy			1
" still , @entity14 accused @entity2 of hubris for thinking he could impose his plan on teachers			2
" when the teachers balked , i 'm sure he figured , ' i 'm an incredibly popular mayor ; teachers are pretty unpopular now ; they 'll cave			2
' well guess what ? they did n't			0
" @entity2 also has faced criticism that he is stretched too thin			0
he recently stepped down as a co-chair of @entity7 's re-election campaign to take on a key role raising money for the campaign through the @entity227			2
@entity51 said the criticisms are off the mark			0
" he certainly knows how to multitask , " @entity51 said			0
" i think he can do this -- and more			0
" in a statement , @entity2 spokesman @entity231 implied -- but did not state explicitly -- that his boss was shifting away from his role as a fundraiser for the @entity63 super @entity236			2
" the mayor 's first priority is the residents of the @entity5 , " @entity231 said in the statement			2
" he is committed to reelecting the president , but he must focus on his job as mayor right now			0
" @entity2 himself addressed the issue monday			0
" do n't worry about the test of my leadership ; that gets tested every day , " he told reporters in @entity5			2
" the only test that matters to me is the test these kids take on whether , when you 've got a kid going into first grade , do they know the letters ? by third grade , can they read ? by fourth grade , can they do the basic math ? that 's the test that matters here			0
" the battle is being watched closely around the country , @entity176 said			0
" mayors want to know if a hard - charging , reform - oriented stance toward labor will prevail , " he said			0
" and , likewise , labor wants to know whether a dig - in - our - heels - and - fight - and - be - willing - to - go - to - the - streets - and - take - job action will prevail			0
" teachers : why do you teach ?			0

" people are going to lose their jobs *...* maybe rightly so , " head of charter school *network* says
