editor 's note : @entity2 is senior lecturer in economics at @entity4			1
a @entity5 , he was one of 166 academic economists who signed a letter to congressional leaders last week opposing the government bailout plan			1
economist @entity2 says the bailout plan presented to @entity12 was the wrong solution to the crisis @entity15 , @entity16 ( @entity17 ) -- @entity12 has balked at the @entity20 administration 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout of @entity21			1
under this plan , the @entity22 would have bought the " troubled assets " of financial institutions in an attempt to avoid economic meltdown			1
this bailout was a terrible idea			1
the current mess would never have occurred in the absence of ill - conceived federal policies			1
the federal government chartered @entity34 in 1938 and @entity35 in 1970 ; these two mortgage lending institutions are at the center of the crisis			1
the government implicitly promised these institutions that it would make good on their debts , so @entity34 and @entity43 took on huge amounts of excessive risk			1
worse , beginning in 1977 and even more in the 1990s and the early part of this century , @entity12 pushed mortgage lenders and @entity34 / @entity43 to expand subprime lending			1
the industry was happy to oblige , given the implicit promise of federal backing , and subprime lending soared			0
this subprime lending was more than a minor relaxation of existing credit guidelines			0
this lending was a wholesale abandonment of reasonable lending practices in which borrowers with poor credit characteristics got mortgages they were ill - equipped to handle			1
once housing prices declined and economic conditions worsened , defaults and delinquencies soared , leaving the industry holding large amounts of severely depreciated mortgage assets			1
the fact that government bears such a huge responsibility for the current mess means any response should eliminate the conditions that created this situation in the first place , not attempt to fix bad government with more government			1
the obvious alternative to a bailout is letting troubled financial institutions declare bankruptcy			1
bankruptcy means that shareholders typically get wiped out and the creditors own the company			0
@entity81 does not mean the company disappears ; it is just owned by someone new ( as has occurred with several airlines )			0
@entity81 punishes those who took excessive risks while preserving those aspects of a businesses that remain profitable			0
in contrast , a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending			2
thus , the bailout encourages companies to take large , imprudent risks and count on getting bailed out by government			1
this " moral hazard " generates enormous distortions in an economy 's allocation of its financial resources			0
thoughtful advocates of the bailout might concede this perspective , but they argue that a bailout is necessary to prevent economic collapse			1
according to this view , lenders are not making loans , even for worthy projects , because they can not get capital			2
this view has a grain of truth ; if the bailout does not occur , more bankruptcies are possible and credit conditions may worsen for a time			2
talk of @entity121 , however , is ridiculous scare - mongering			1
if financial institutions can not make productive loans , a profit opportunity exists for someone else			0
this might not happen instantly , but it will happen			0
further , the current credit freeze is likely due to @entity21 's hope of a bailout ; bankers will not sell their lousy assets for 20 cents on the dollar if the government might pay 30 , 50 , or 80 cents			1
the costs of the bailout , moreover , are almost certainly being understated			2
the administration 's claim is that many mortgage assets are merely illiquid , not truly worthless , implying taxpayers will recoup much of their $ 700 billion			0
if these assets are worth something , however , private parties should want to buy them , and they would do so if the owners would accept fair market value			0
far more likely is that current owners have brushed under the rug how little their assets are worth			0
the bailout has more problems			2
the final legislation will probably include numerous side conditions and special dealings that reward @entity156 lobbyists and their clients			0
anticipation of the bailout will engender strategic behavior by @entity21 institutions as they shuffle their assets and position their balance sheets to maximize their take			2
the bailout will open the door to further federal meddling in financial markets			2
so what should the government do ? eliminate those policies that generated the current mess			2
this means , at a general level , abandoning the goal of home ownership independent of ability to pay			0
this means , in particular , getting rid of @entity34 and @entity35 , along with policies like the @entity179 that pressure banks into subprime lending			0
the right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place			0
someone has to pay for that			0
that someone should not be , and does not need to be , the @entity187 taxpayer			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : government encouraged lenders to relax their *standards*
mortgages were given to *people* *unqualified* to repay them , he says
@entity2 : rather than a bailout , government should let firms go bankrupt
talk of economic @entity121 is scare - mongering , @entity2 says
