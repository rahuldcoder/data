-- for @entity2 , it all started with sleeplessness			1
in 1993 she was having marital troubles and her business was n't doing well			2
anxiety kept her up at night , so her general practitioner prescribed sleeping pills			2
i felt very relaxed and i would sleep better , " @entity11 remembers			1
" i thought this was certainly the right prescription for me			2
" then a few weeks later , another symptom developed			2
" it was so unusual			2
i started having bronchitis and lung infections , " she recalls			2
she went to a pulmonologist who prescribed an antibiotic			2
" my heart started skipping beats , so i was referred to a cardiologist , " explains @entity11 , who says other than a series of surgeries after a car accident , she had been completely healthy until this point in her life			1
the cardiologist ran a few tests and prescribed medication to treat arrhythmias			2
it did n't end there			2
at this point , she was already taking at least six different prescriptions from three separate specialists			1
she went to see a neurologist who prescribed an anti-seizure medication on top of that			2
" my whole day became pills and doctors and shots , " she says			2
rain 's insomnia returned as things continued to spiral out of control			2
despite all the testing and prescriptions , she says no one could figure out the problem			1
she was put on temporary disability			0
" when i finally got to a shrink of course i was depressed , because no one could figure out what was wrong with me ! it never occurred to me that it might be the pills themselves			0
" too many drugs , too little communication at her worst , @entity2 was under the care of a general practitioner , pulmonologist , cardiologist , pain management specialist and a psychiatrist			0
she was spending more than $ 900 a month , taking 12 different types of medication , amounting to about a thousand pills a month			1
" that 's what i call prescription multiplication , " says @entity78 , an associate professor of clinical pharmacy , psychiatry and the behavioral sciences at the @entity82			0
he says it is not uncommon for patients to receive multiple prescriptions from different specialists , each focusing on a specific symptom			1
@entity91 says it can be potentially dangerous for the patient , especially if the various physicians are n't communicating with one another			0
" a patient could have adverse effects and think the medical condition is getting worse , when in fact it is a side effect of several different medications which are all interacting in a negative way , " @entity78 says			0
" when you 're on more than 20 drugs all at the same time , you 'd want to question whether or not that 's really necessary			0
" according to the @entity106 , prescription drug usage in the @entity105 is continuing to rise			1
a recent report finds the number of prescriptions filled each year increased by 39 % between 1999 and 2009 , and the amount of money spent was $ 234 billion in 2008			1
the average @entity105 fills 12 prescriptions each year			1
" many side effects from drug interactions ( not all ) are exacerbations of known side effects of the single drugs that are made worse by the two drugs together , " says dr. @entity113 , a professor of bioengineering , genetics and medicine at @entity116			0
he co-authored a study in the journal @entity125 that found a widely prescribed antidepressant used in conjunction with a common cholesterol - lowering medication caused unexpected increases in blood sugar levels			0
@entity113 says most drugs are tested and approved independently , and it can be difficult to predict the side effects of drug combinations			0
" it is very hard to find these in advance of release of the drug , because sometimes these effects will only manifest in the context of large numbers of patients , " he explains			1
" i do n't think people really understand the nature of medication ; the ( drugs ) will , by definition , have some toxic , collateral side effects , " says dr. @entity143 , a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at @entity146			0
his 2008 book " before you take that @entity159 " warned patients of the risks and benefits of some commonly prescribed drugs			1
@entity143 says medications clearly do a lot of good and are needed in many situations , but warns that when a patient is on too many ay once , there are serious questions about whether the therapeutic benefits outweigh the collateral			0
" when you end up on 12 prescription medications you need to seriously look at what the situation is , " he says			1
" at that point , there 's no way of knowing what 's causing what anymore			1
" " i do n't want to do this anymore " @entity91 recommends patients fulfill all their prescriptions at one pharmacy , especially if they are receiving treatment from multiple practitioners			1
" often the pharmacist is the best point person because they 're the last stop before the prescription hits the hand of the patient and are ready to be taken			1
" he says the most important thing is to have one person who is keeping track of the various drugs and how they could interact			0
if you ca n't have a single overall manager of treatment , experts suggest keeping a list of all your prescriptions and showing the list to any physician introducing a new medication			1
@entity113 says , when possible , introducing new medications one at a time can help you recognize side effects and interactions earlier			0
you can potentially trace them to the most recent drug added , he says			0
@entity143 also advises patients to check out websites like @entity214 and @entity215 and read the experiences others have had with the medication you have just been prescribed			1
" patients should become more educated about the effects and not just blindly take what is given to them			1
" @entity11 says she reached her tipping point in 2003			1
" i opened my medicine cabinet and saw it lined with prescription pill bottles , " she remembers			0
" i looked at myself in the mirror			0
my skin was gray , i was hunched over in pain , my eyes were swollen and i had no quality of life			0
i thought , ' i do n't want to do this anymore			0
' " she decided to quit taking all her prescriptions cold turkey -- something neither she nor other experts recommend for any patient			1
" you ca n't go cold turkey off that many pills without doing some damage , " @entity11 says			1
she eventually enrolled in a drug rehab facility that helps victims of substance abuse			0
today , @entity2 runs a company called @entity247 , which educates patients about the effects of prescription medications and helps them outline an " exit strategy " for safely tapering off highly addictive varieties of prescription drugs			1
" i spent 10 years on the pills before i realized there was no exit strategy			0
it was always more drugs , never less			0
" says @entity11 , who later learned the cause of her initial insomnia was a b - 12 vitamin deficiency			1
she is now taking one daily multivitamin			0
" my life became nothing but a bag of pills , and i just thought there has to be a different way			0

at one point , @entity11 was seeing six specialists
experts say ideally patients on multiple prescriptions should get them fulfilled by one pharmacist
report : average @entity105 fills 12 prescriptions each year
