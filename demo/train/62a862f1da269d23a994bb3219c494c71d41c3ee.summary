-- @entity1 retained the yellow jersey on a day of toil and trouble as @entity6 's @entity5 won the ninth stage of the @entity8			1
@entity9 , who has a one minute and 25 second lead over his closest challenger , was forced to battle on his own as his teammates failed to give him adequate protection			1
@entity16 lost his grip on second place overall after finishing more than 17 minutes adrift , while @entity19 was swept up by a broom wagon and is unlikely to feature in the remainder of the @entity8			2
there was also misery for @entity24 , who suffered bruising after falling from his bike -- an incident which left @entity1 wide open to attack on all fronts			1
" this was one of the hardest days i have ever had on the bike , " @entity1 told reporters			1

@entity44 principal @entity43 revealed his surprise at seeing his team struggle with @entity16 's failure particularly difficult for him to comprehend			1
" that was a bit of a surprise , it is not often we 've seen @entity16 have a day like that , " @entity43 said			0
" he fought for a long time and he was n't that far back , but eventually you have to think about the future of the race and not just today			0
" it was increasingly clear we were going to keep the jersey so there was no need to dig really deep			2
" it was better that he sat up and saved himself			0
" @entity63 's @entity5 is the first @entity36 to win a stage since @entity35 won stage 16 of the 1992 tour in @entity67			1
" we just wanted to have fun today , " the 26 - year - old told reporters			0
