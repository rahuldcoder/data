-- in recent days , with the tiniest poke of a toe in the political waters -- a few comments to news organizations about the recent @entity7 ruling on president @entity9 's health care law -- former rep. @entity10 has set off a frenzy of speculation that he may be planning to run for mayor of @entity15 in 2013			1
at first glance , a second political act for @entity10 might seem impossible			1
it was a little more than a year ago that the @entity19 crashed and burned on national television , tearfully resigning after right - wing bloggers exposed his bizarre habit of sending raunchy photos and messages to strangers			0
but he 's being taken seriously in @entity15 political circles -- an acknowledgment of his considerable energy and talent for championing middle - class values , and a testament to the city 's habit of tolerating and rehabilitating fallen pols			1
on wednesday night , when asked in an interview with @entity35 whether he is considering a bid for mayor , @entity10 said he is not planning a campaign -- but he did n't rule out a run for political office in the future			1
it was june 2011 when comedians of late - night tv were feasting on @entity10 's misery			1
conservatives crowed over the scalp they 'd claimed -- and were ecstatic when a @entity48 won the special election to replace @entity10			1
a few months later , with no longtime incumbent to protect the seat , @entity10 's district was eliminated altogether when population changes required @entity54 to reduce the size of its congressional delegation			1
that appeared to be the final chapter in @entity10 's political career			2
he claims to have no plans beyond caring for his newborn son and insists that recent news stories are simply wrong			0
but that 's not the end of the story to those of us who have been watching @entity10 since the days when , at age 27 , he became the youngest member of the @entity71			2
although known across the nation as a left - wing firebrand , @entity10 has had a profile in @entity15 as a pragmatic , centrist @entity19 willing to break from the city 's liberal orthodoxy			1
in 2005 , when @entity10 made a first run for mayor , he publicly castigated the eventual @entity80 nominee for proposing the re-imposition of a local tax on every stock trade to raise money from @entity85 ( a favorite but unworkable liberal plan )			1
@entity10 often railed against the rising cost of living for his financially squeezed constituents ( 45 % of whom voted for @entity90 in 2008 ) and co-founded a bipartisan @entity91 in @entity92			2
as the third and final term of mayor @entity95 winds down , the field of @entity80 running to succeed him lacks a candidate with @entity10 's loud , laserlike focus on middle - class issues			1
that absence has political insiders wondering if there might be room at the table for @entity10			2
even more tantalizing is @entity10 's $ 4.5 million political war chest that would , if activated , qualify him for $ 1.5 million in public matching funds and land him near the city 's $ 6.7 million campaign spending cap			2
that makes him one of the best - funded mayoral candidates in @entity15 , and more than just the punch line of a joke			2
as for the ick factor -- the creepy cause of @entity10 's resignation -- he might end up benefiting from the wide latitude @entity15 tend to allow public figures when it comes to their personal lives			1
back in the 1920s , one of @entity15 's most flamboyant and corrupt mayors , @entity120 was married but carried on affairs with women who frequented the speak - easies that flourished in the city during his tenure			2
@entity120 eventually left his wife to run off with a " chorus girl " he later married , but the carousing did n't stop him from getting re-elected in 1929 ( when he defeated none other than @entity134 )			0
fast - forward to modern times when mayor @entity137 used a press conference to announce plans to separate from his second wife -- who apparently learned of his intentions from news reports -- and tried to have her kicked out of @entity144 , the official mayoral residence , so that his new girlfriend could move in			0
@entity137 eventually straightened out his personal life : he got a divorce and girlfriend @entity148 became wife no. 3			0
@entity15 more or less shrugged			0
even ex- gov. @entity150 , who resigned after admitting to hiring prostitutes , has returned to public life , hosting a nightly show on @entity154 and recently offering weekly commentary alongside other ex-officials on the @entity15 political tv show " @entity158			1
" as host of the show , i have received exactly one complaint to date			0
many @entity15 -- admittedly , not all -- treat politicians the way they would a plumber or auto repairman : if you 've hired the guy to unclog your sink or fix the brakes , he should be judged on that performance , and what goes on in his personal life should remain between him and his wife			1
in fact , according to a @entity178 / @entity177 poll , a majority of @entity10 's congressional constituents thought he should not have resigned after the sexting scandal			0
the biggest hurdle @entity10 has to clear is the dishonest way he handled the early stages of the scandal			0
as the salacious photos emerged and the blogosphere exploded , @entity10 unwisely had his office ring up various press outlets and went from one show to another , offering blatant lies and denials about how photos of his privates ended up on @entity195 and @entity196			0
that left a bad taste in the mouths of reporters , producers and editors			0
as the @entity207 editorial board notes : " @entity10 's sexual escapades were , in fact , the least of his sins			0
he proved to be a stone - cold liar as he tried to save his skin			0
" if it 's true that , as @entity10 insists , he had no physical contact with the women to whom he sent raunchy messages , he will likely get as least as much latitude as @entity137 and @entity150			1
and if @entity10 has the support of his family -- and is prepared to make a full apology for the lying -- he can eventually expect to find his way back into some form of public service			1
your move , mr. @entity10			0
