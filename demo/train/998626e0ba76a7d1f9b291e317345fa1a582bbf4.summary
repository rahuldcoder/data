-- @entity1 was searching his iphone for a @entity5 app when he stumbled across @entity6 , a service of web site @entity8			0
soon he was regularly logging into the @entity11 - based cyber-church -- some 4,100 miles away from @entity13 's home in the @entity14 , west of @entity15			2
" it allows me to connect with others and have conversations about the message , " says @entity13 , who shares his faith with other believers in the site 's live chat room			0
" technology allows us today to have fellowship across borders and cultures			0
" in doing so , @entity1 joined growing numbers of @entity30 worldwide who are migrating from the chapel to the computer			1
a map on the @entity6 site showed users from 22 countries logged into a recent service			0
online religious services offer convenience to those who are too isolated or infirm to attend a real - world church			1
but can worshipping via a computer offer true spiritual fulfillment ? internet pastors and parishioners cite their 24 - hour access to interactive tools and social - networking platforms to show their online experiences are as meaningful as those that take place with face - to - face congregations			1
" we were blown away at how people could actually worship along [ online ] , " says @entity54 , senior pastor at @entity8			1
" the whole family will gather around the computer , and they 'll sing and they 'll worship together			1
instead of trying to get people to come to a church , we feel like we can take a church to them			2
" but critics believe virtual worship separates followers from a trinity of spiritual essentials found in brick - and - mortar @entity30 churches : community , communion and connection with @entity73			1
" online church is close enough to the real thing to be dangerous , " says @entity74 , a pastor who leads the brick - and - mortar @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77			1
in a blog post for @entity81 , he writes that calling it virtual church " gives people the idea that everything they need is available here			1
" the debate is an extension of a wider argument over social interaction in virtual environments versus the physical world			1
but because practices of faith are involved , both sides are deeply invested in the outcome , seeing it as a statement on the nature of the @entity30 person 's relationship with @entity102			1
supporters of online churches have a common response to their skeptics : try before you criticize			2
the virtual experience goes far beyond using live chat rooms to exchange emoticons instead of hugs and handshakes , they say			0
links allow congregants to " raise their hand " and publicly commit to @entity73 , while prayer requests and one - on - one guidance are a click way			0
sermon notes can be shared and discussed			0
and many online churches are aided by volunteers , allowing them to hold services several times each day			1
the internet campus of the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128 , pulls in more than 2,000 congregants from around the world during its sunday services			1
pastor @entity132 said his three children are part of the internet generation that will eventually decide the future of worship			0
they use web tools to stay in constant connection with friends over vast distances , which @entity132 says " gives me confidence that it can happen in online church			2
" but the disconnect from physical closeness is what @entity74 said he 's " fighting hardest against			0
" his own church offers online extensions such as podcasts and forums			2
but he believes " the computer screen is a supplement , not a replacement			0
" @entity154 and other critics are particularly distressed by the online offering of traditional sacraments , such as communion and baptism			1
he believes it is " ridiculous " that someone can grab grape juice and a cracker from the fridge and watch a computer screen , thinking they are truly participating in a gathering of the faithful			0
" something about the physical presence , breaking the same bread , is what @entity158 is meant to be , " he says			0
but @entity6 participant @entity172 disagrees			0
" knowing that others are also celebrating @entity158 , regardless of location , makes it an especially wonderful time , " says @entity174 , who believes real - world @entity158 can ring hollow			1
" when i 've taken @entity158 in live surroundings , i often got the sense that it was ritualistic and without meaning			0
" @entity182 , a parishioner in the @entity183 in @entity184 , believes that the meaning of the ritual is what matters			0
" if people are willing to go to the trouble of giving their own @entity158 , then it is quite probably ' real ' for them , " he says			0
while @entity182 chooses to remain at his face - to - face church , he believes any person " faithfully attending an online church service , is being more proactive , and thus probably more attentive , than many longtime churchgoers			1
" @entity195 , lead pastor of @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity198 , and author of " @entity200 , " a book about @entity203 church services , would like to see this debate go away			2
" the @entity5 sees church not as a man - made building but as a people gathered to glorify @entity102 with their lives , " he says			2
@entity195 believes the quality of a community should be judged by the spiritual fellowship it offers			2
" there is only one substantive difference between an online church and a brick - and - mortar church : the place where they meet			1

a growing number of @entity30 worldwide are migrating from the chapel to the computer
online religious services offer convenience to those who ca *n't* attend a real - world church
critics believe virtual worship lacks spiritual essentials , such as community
critics also are upset by the online offering of sacraments such as communion
