-- in a country as splintered as the @entity3 has become , can there be any such thing as a national pastime ? the phrase has been associated with the game of baseball since late in the 19th century , when sportswriters began dropping it into their stories			1
it was a great promotional slogan for the sport ; whether it ever was literally true is open to question			0
but it would be just about impossible to make the case that baseball is the national pastime today ; in a country of 314 million people , this year 's @entity19 drew , on average , a television audience of only 12.7 million viewers per game ( football 's @entity25 this year attracted an audience of more than 111 million )			1
yet the question is not which sport has become the national pastime , but whether any single activity of any kind qualifies for that title			1
cohesion is not exactly the dominating quality of 21st - century life ; we are endlessly being reminded of all the choices we have about how to spend our time , and the concept of the entire country gravitating toward one leisure - time activity sounds beyond archaic			2
if baseball ever was , at least symbolically , the national pastime , it was supplanted in the early 1950s by the rapid growth in the number of television sets in @entity3 homes			1
suddenly something was happening that had never before occurred : people all over the country were looking at the same thing at the same time			0
most mornings , the main topic of conversation in offices , factories and schools across the continent was something that had been on all those television screens the night before			0
there were only three channels to watch in most cities , and perhaps an additional " educational " channel , the forerunner to @entity67			0
the nation had a new pastime , and it took place indoors			2
the great majority of @entity3 who are alive today have no memory at all of a world before television			1
the median age in the @entity3 hovers right around 37 years old ; this means that half of all @entity3 were born in 1975 or later			1
the presence of television , to them , is as unremarkable as the sight of the sun in the summer sky			0
and a newer pastime , as we all know , has emerged , on screens of a different sort			2
to take note of how free time ( whatever that has come to mean ) is now being spent , all you have to do is walk down any street in any city or small town , and observe your fellow pedestrians checking the screens they grasp in their palms			0
but the hegemony of early television , with those three channels , is a distant memory			0
no one can take the public 's attention for granted today ; first the advent of cable television fragmented viewing patterns , and then came the boundless @entity109 , followed by the creative forces that provide the content for all those little personal screens			1
@entity113 offers around 700,000 separate applications , as does @entity115			0
a lot of ways to pass the time , in a nation with a twitching concentration span			0
and there is always something around the next corner			0
the same way there are fewer and fewer @entity3 who can describe to you what the country was like before television , soon enough there will be few @entity3 who will be able to recall a world before the @entity109			1
it is hard to conceive , but social history tells us that the seemingly limitless array of ways to spend time today will before long seem constricted and small			2
there is a famous and provocative phrase , translated from the writings of @entity141 , that has been used in various contexts over the years : " the opiate of the masses			1
" the concept of people being susceptible to a symbolic opiate of any kind remains controversial and current			0
do today 's @entity3 simply enjoy the screens they carry with them , or are they psychologically addicted to them -- is it a pleasurable pastime , or are they hooked ? it 's not an unfair question			1
( and as far as opiates go -- pharmacological and figurative -- the @entity154 recently reported on an intriguing development at @entity157 in @entity158 , as explained by @entity159 , @entity160 's chief nursing officer : " @entity160 agreed to double the number of tv channels in rooms and add @entity164 because ' the requests for pain medication go down during the afternoon football games , ' dr. @entity153 said			0
" ) our pastimes are many , and the very idea of a national pastime goes against the contemporary aversion to doing only one thing at a time			1
although the very real possibility exists that , seemingly contradictorily , we have indeed settled on a new kind of national pastime : multitasking			1
baseball 's starting to sound better and better			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			2

@entity180 says it 's been *awhile* since baseball has been the @entity3 national pastime
he says life fragmented today ; few things unify @entity3 as a *shared* pastime . @entity190 once did
he says @entity109 has further splintered interests ; is *computer* screen new opiate of masses ?
@entity180 : new national pastime may just be multitasking . makes you wish for baseball
