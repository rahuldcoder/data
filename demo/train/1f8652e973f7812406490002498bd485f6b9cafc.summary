@entity0 , @entity1 -- a high school gym erupts with cheers as the announcer introduces the women fighting to be the nation 's top amateur boxers			1
names like @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 sound out over the @entity13 , as young @entity15 with impressively defined arms take to the ring			0
the top four boxers who medaled at the @entity18 in late june have a rare distinction this year : women 's boxing has been added to the @entity21 in @entity22			1
the traditionally male sport of boxing was the only summer sport at the @entity26 without a female counterpart			1
the last great domain of men in sports is about to crumble , and a bunch of @entity15 , flyweight boxers who tip the scales at no more than 112 pounds , are leading the way the principal figure in this sport 's revolution is @entity38 , a 22 - year - old @entity39 of @entity41 descent who was already a five - time national champion in the flyweight division coming into this year 's tournament			1
@entity10 is aware that her success represents more than a personal victory			0
" i feel like being a woman and @entity54 , and doing something well , would help us out as far as how people view us , " says @entity10 , whose success has drawn sponsors like @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
boxing has been a huge sport in the @entity54 world for decades , producing some of the community 's biggest stars , such as @entity63 " @entity64 , a @entity65 who defeated @entity66 for the world heavyweight title in 2001			1
some boxers say @entity15 have a different boxing style that makes them stand out , always pushing forward and playing a strong mental game			2
" we @entity15 are natural fighters , " says @entity64 , who is writing " @entity73 , " a book about the @entity26 journey			1
" we fight all our lives to get ahead			0
some of us even grow up in the streets fighting with our fists			0
boxing has always been a sport of @entity54 culture , and , like every other area , now the @entity15 are taking it and owning it , making it our victory			1
" @entity10 began fighting at 11 when she accompanied her brothers to a gym in @entity87 because her @entity41 - born father , @entity89 , whose hero was @entity41 boxing legend @entity90 , wanted his boys to take up the sport			1
as it turned out , the @entity10 boys hated boxing , but little @entity38 begged their trainer , @entity96 , to coach her			1
he 's a police officer who patrols a tough @entity87 high school , and @entity10 , who was having disciplinary problems in school , was just the kind of kid he sought to help			2
but he could n't see how a girl could fit into his all - male program			2
" i tested her by boxing the boys , figuring she would get scared off , " he remembers			2
" suddenly it was she who was testing them ! " @entity96 took her on and helped guide her to the sport 's elite level			2
there are no shortcuts : it takes unbelievable dedication to withstand the punishing training regimen of a champion boxer			2
but at age 16 , too young to qualify , @entity10 sneaked into the national championships and won			2
since then she has competed in the @entity121 and the @entity122			0
her success has drawn other @entity15 into boxing			0
" if i make it to the @entity26 it 's going to mean so much to my community , " she says			1
@entity10 has only lost once in the @entity128 since she began entering national competitions nine years ago , and it was to another @entity131 : @entity132 , a @entity65 boxer who dominates the @entity135 women 's boxing scene			1
@entity128 @entity26 coach @entity136 , who has trained the @entity128 men 's team for 33 years , notes that women 's amateur boxing has been dominated by blacks and @entity15 from working - class backgrounds , and that many have been transformed by the discipline of the sport			1
@entity10 fits that profile : once a troublemaker , she graduated in the top 2 % of her high school class			0
eight women will compete in each of three weight classes at the @entity26 trials			1
they are the winners of the top national tournaments			0
so far , half the flyweights are latinas			0
the other weight classes are dominated by @entity157 boxers			0
all the competitors will be chosen by october 8 , after the year 's last major national fight , the @entity161 championships			1
the trials are scheduled for february 2012			0
only one woman in each weight class at the trials will make @entity165 and win the chance to compete internationally			0
meanwhile , @entity10 has tied the record for most national championships by winning her sixth			0
@entity10 says she 's winning now by using guile and smarts , as well as her fists			0
" i move my head a lot and i time people , " she says			0
if her timing is right , @entity10 will not only continue to get victories in the @entity157 ring , but she may just make a mark for @entity15 around the world .			0
