@entity5 had maintained since the may 10 slaying that he was innocent despite @entity16 's explosive videotape , which was made public the day after his death			0
@entity6 authorities have arrested 11 men on suspicion that they carried out the killing , but the @entity29 brothers remain at large			1

the next day , @entity12 said , @entity16 asked a friend to buy two cell phones anonymously			0

@entity16 used one of the phones to call threats to his personal cell phone and had the other delivered to the @entity29 brothers , who gave it to the hit squad leader			1
@entity16 then used the new cell phone he kept to give instructions to the hit squad leader through the second phone , @entity12 said			1
@entity12 detailed how the slaying apparently was meant to be paid through a $ 40,000 check			0
according to the investigator , @entity16 told his secretary before his death that she would be receiving a check from @entity157 that should be delivered to the @entity29 brothers			2
the check had been made out by @entity158 , a @entity16 friend and business associate who at the time was @entity6 's minister of communication , @entity12 said			1
@entity158 resigned from office in june , a few weeks after the slaying			0
