@entity0 , @entity1 -- a key witness in the @entity5 drug trial denied wednesday that she was coached by the prosecutor on testimony the defense argued is false			1
the judge is considering striking the testimony of one of @entity5 's former nannies after a defense lawyer accused the prosecution of " suborning perjury " -- coaching the witness to lie			1
the judge also released dozens of personal photos of the actress with her infant daughter , @entity21 , and boyfriend - lawyer @entity22			1
the defense showed the pictures to jurors to counter the argument that @entity5 was drugged during much of her last months			1
@entity22 and drs. @entity27 and @entity28 are on trial for allegedly conspiring to provide drugs to an addict and using false names on prescriptions for @entity5			1
the trial , in its seventh week , took a dramatic turn wednesday when defense attorney @entity36 accused prosecutor @entity37 of knowingly having @entity38 , a former @entity5 nanny , lie on the stand			1
" the people ( prosecution ) know this is fraudulent , " @entity36 said at the end of the direct testimony of @entity38			2
if judge @entity45 accepts a defense motion to strike the entire testimony of the nanny , it would be a major blow to an already staggered prosecution case			1
" i am thinking about it , " judge @entity45 said			2
he already ordered the jury to ignore a portion of the testimony of @entity38 's sister - in - law , @entity56 , because he found it unreliable			2
@entity38 and @entity56 were supposed to be star witnesses for the prosecution			0
they both worked for @entity5 in the @entity61 for several months after the birth of her daughter in september 2006			2
they were fired two months before @entity5 died in a @entity66 hotel in february 2007			2
the two nannies , both @entity67 who live in the @entity61 , have recanted key portions of statements they made earlier concerning @entity5 's drug use in the last months of her life			1
on wednesday , @entity38 recanted an earlier statement that she had seen @entity22 melt pills in a soup spoon and then inject the drug into @entity5 during cross-examination wednesday			1
instead , @entity38 said she only saw a spoon that appeared to be burned in @entity5 's bathroom			1
she assumed it had used that way " because i saw it on tv " in a movie			0
she also backed away from earlier testimony that she had been threatened by unknown people , which prompted her to go into hiding a week after @entity5 's february 2007 death			1
she explained wednesday that she became afraid after getting phone calls at her home from @entity2 's @entity91 and @entity92			1
she and her sister - in - law had both testified that they demanded the prosecution pay to relocate them to new homes in the @entity61 as a condition for their testimony			0
fear for their safety was the reason , they both said			0
" i tell them ( if ) i come to testify i 'm going to need to move from where i am , " @entity38 said			0
the defense has also highlighted other financial benefits the @entity0 district attorney has given the women in order to convince them to fly to the @entity108 to testify			0
the prosecution not only paid for the two witnesses to travel to @entity0 , but they were allowed to bring seven other family members at taxpayer expense			0
" i tell them i would not leave my family behind , " @entity38 said			0
a nephew tagged along with her three children and her husband			0
@entity56 brought her two children with her			0
prosecutor @entity37 worked to convince jurors that the taxpayer - funded trip has been no luxury vacation , given as a reward for testimony			0
the children have not been taken to @entity126 or even a movie in the eight days they 've been staying in a @entity0 hotel , @entity38 testified			0
they 've stuck close to the hotel watching television and swimming in the pool , @entity38 said			0
the only outing was for two hours to a " little park " on sunday , she testified			0
judge @entity45 has suggested several times in recent weeks that the prosecution had fallen short so far in proving the core of its case , including that @entity5 was a drug addict			1
the defense contends that @entity5 suffered chronic pain , justifying the drug prescriptions in question			2
" if she 's being treated for pain , it 's not illegal , " judge @entity45 said tuesday .			2
