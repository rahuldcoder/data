@entity0 -- is @entity2 a villain or a hero ? was the off - duty federal agent brave and chivalrous , or did he overreact when he intervened in a heated domestic argument and shot a man five times , killing him ? a @entity10 jury this week will hear the case for and against @entity2 , a nine - year veteran of the @entity13 @entity12 , now charged with second degree murder			1
the prosecution of special agent @entity16 for the 2008 shooting death of @entity18 has enraged many federal law enforcement officers , who say @entity2 was heroically coming to the defense of a battered woman			1
federal authorities were so incensed by the @entity25 's prosecution of @entity2 -- and so concerned other federal agents could similarly be prosecuted -- that they removed all @entity12 agents from the @entity10 in 2008 , a policy that continues today , the agency said			1
the @entity10 is an unincorporated territory of the @entity13 , and as such has a unique legal relationship with the federal government			2
while the broad outline of the shooting is undisputed , two government investigations came to starkly different conclusions			0
a federal government multi-agency investigation of the 2008 incident unanimously concluded the shooting was justified			0
the @entity12 even returned @entity2 's gun and badge and put him back to work			1
but a @entity43 investigation prompted prosecutors to charge @entity2 with second degree murder			1
the incident occurred the morning of sunday , september 7 , 2008 , outside a @entity48 condo , where all of the main participants were neighbors			0
according to a police affidavit , @entity2 was leaving his condo when he encountered @entity53 and his girlfriend , @entity54			2
they had been drinking and were having a " disagreement			0
" @entity57 asked @entity2 for a ride to the guard gate and got in @entity2 's sports utility vehicle			1
@entity18 approached @entity2 , who was sitting in the car with the driver 's door open			1
one witness said he saw @entity18 striking the driver 's door with his flashlight , and saw @entity2 draw his weapon and tell @entity69 to step back			1
" mr. @entity18 stood there with his hands at his side when @entity74 [ sic ] discharged his firearm at him several times , " the affidavit reads			1
local prosecutors evidently were heavily influenced by two facts : first , the deceased , @entity18 , was armed only with a flashlight ; second , @entity2 shot him five times			1
" these facts are undisputed and were the findings of the local police investigation , " gov. @entity81 wrote in a letter justifying the prosecution			0
but a defense lawyer says the local police department 's affidavit is inaccurate and its investigation grossly incomplete			0
attorney @entity91 said @entity18 weighed 260 pounds , had a history of violent assaults , and was acting violently at the time of the incident			2
when @entity2 first encountered the fighting couple , @entity18 was naked , intoxicated and shouting threats at his girlfriend and racial slurs at a neighbor who had come out during the commotion			1
at one point , @entity18 went into his condo and returned wearing gym shorts , and then pelted his girlfriend 's car with landscaping stones			1
after @entity57 sought refuge in @entity2 's car , @entity18 charged at @entity2 's open driver door , the flashlight -- a heavy - duty , 18 - inch metal one -- raised " like a tomahawk , " poised to strike @entity2 , @entity91 said			1
@entity2 fired rapidly , as he was trained , @entity91 said			2
tests later showed that @entity18 had a blood - alcohol content of 0.29 percent , and had barbiturates and morphine in his blood , the defense lawyer said			2
@entity91 said the former head trainer for the @entity43 academy will testify as an expert witness that the shooting was justified			0
@entity91 said he also has subpoenaed the @entity10 ' governor and first lady to testify , because @entity57 called them shortly after the shooting			2
he declined to say what he expected them to say			0
on monday , @entity12 deputy director @entity130 reiterated the agency 's support for @entity2			1
" special agent @entity2 intervened in a domestic dispute in order to protect a woman that was endangered by her boyfriend			2
his actions were necessary to save a woman 's life and his own life , " @entity130 said			0
" the @entity12 family supports special agent @entity2 and seeks an immediate , non-criminal resolution in this matter			1
" @entity2 's attorney fought to have the case transferred to federal court , saying @entity2 was acting as a federal agent and deserved federal protections			1
but a district court judge ruled against the motion , and a federal court has declined to halt the trial			0
" @entity156 is a federal @entity12 agent who does not have peace officer status under @entity10 law and therefore had no authority to enforce law including the domestic violence statutes , " said @entity154 , a spokeswoman for the @entity155			1
as a private citizen , @entity2 was authorized to carry a gun and use reasonable force to defend himself and others , @entity154 said			0
but @entity69 " did not inflict bodily harm on anyone the morning he was shot , " she said			0
" that 's the government 's general position in this case			0
we believe that he used excessive force instead of reasonable force in this matter , " @entity154 said			0
@entity2 's advocates say the case has far - reaching ramifications			1
" it is well recognized that federal law enforcement officers are immune from state criminal liability for actions that are taken within the scope of their employment as federal officers , " sen. @entity178 , @entity180 - @entity179 , wrote in a letter to @entity182			0
" that principle ... applies with equal force in @entity13 territories			0
" the @entity2 prosecution " has the potential to create a chilling effect on the operation of federal law enforcement throughout the @entity13 ' territories , " @entity178 wrote			2
" the @entity13 law enforcement community is outraged that the @entity10 prosecutor seems more intent on punishing @entity13 cops than woman beaters , " @entity200 , president of the @entity201 , said in a written statement			0
@entity200 and others are calling for an investigation into the prosecution , saying it is in retaliation for federal corruption investigation in the @entity10			2
the spokeswoman for the @entity155 said a jury will determine the appropriateness of the shooting			0
that jury was being selected monday , and the trial is expected to last seven days , she said .			0
