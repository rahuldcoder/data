@entity0 -- after seven weeks of colorful witnesses and rancorous testimony , the jury began deliberations tuesday in the trial of alleged crime boss @entity7			1
eight men and four women on the federal court panel have the monumental task of processing testimony from drug traffickers , extortion victims , gangsters , families of alleged victims and shooting victims , along with more than six hours of closing arguments			0
@entity7 is accused of 19 killings and 13 counts of extortion and money laundering during a 20 - year " reign of terror " that defined @entity0 from the early ' 70s through 1995 , when @entity7 fled @entity0			1
jurors deliberated for six hours tuesday before court was suspended for the day shortly after 4:30 p.m. et. deliberations are scheduled to resume wednesday at 9 a.m. jurors will have to decide if the government has proven its case and if @entity7 is guilty of the alleged crimes " beyond a reasonable doubt			1
" " you must decide which evidence to believe and which witnesses are true			0
you can believe some , or all , or none , " @entity38 district court judge @entity37 told the jurors tuesday , adding a cautionary instruction for government witnesses who have entered into plea deals for immunity and lesser sentences			0
@entity46 advised that jurors weigh the potential that these witnesses " may have a motive to make up stories			0
" simultaneously , jurors are advised not to draw inferences from a witness 's guilty plea			0
plea deals for gangsters in their closing arguments monday , defense attorneys attacked the credibility of gangsters who became star witnesses for the prosecution , testifying under immunity after they learned @entity7 was an informant for the @entity66 for nearly two decades			1
prosecuting attorney @entity67 on monday defended the government 's unsavory plea deals with those gangsters , three of whom implicated @entity7 in the 19 murders and various acts of extortion			1
" the government did n't choose them , @entity7 chose them , " @entity67 said			1
" the only thing worse than making a deal with ( former hit man ) @entity80 would have been not making a deal with @entity80			0
" @entity67 said the government " held its nose and made the deal			0
" prosecutors called 63 witnesses during the course of the trial , with the defense bringing only 10 to the stand			2
@entity80 testified for both sides , making a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days			0
as he presented his closing argument monday , @entity67 called @entity7 one of the most " vicious , violent and calculating criminals to ever walk the streets of @entity0			1
" the prosecution took close to three and a half hours for its closing			0
the defense took over two and a half hours to make its case , then the prosecution had the final word in a rebuttal			2
defense attorney @entity107 summed up his case by questioning the credibility of prosecution witnesses , some of whom came to court with extensive criminal resumes and who had worked out deals with the government in exchange for testifying against @entity7			1
" if you can not say in your deliberation that i personally can believe ( prosecution witnesses ) beyond a reasonable doubt , then the government can not prove its case about the alleged murders , " @entity107 told the jury			2
" the government is buying the testimony of these witnesses			0
the currency used here ( is ) how much freedom someone is going to get			0
what the government can pay the individual is the individual 's freedom , " @entity107 continued			2
earlier , @entity67 said @entity7 and his partner " plotted , they schemed , they robbed they murdered together , they were also informants together			2
" prosecutors contend @entity7 was an @entity66 informant who used protection from rogue agents as he continued his life of crime			1
defense attorneys have argued @entity7 was not an informant , and that @entity66 bungling was key in the case			1
" if there is one thing you heard during this trial , it 's how secretive that relationship is , " @entity67 said to the jury monday			2
" the last thing a criminal wants ... is for people to know he 's an informant			0
" but he also said that it " does n't matter whether or not @entity7 is an @entity66 informant when he put the gun to the head of @entity161 and pulled the trigger			1
" @entity163 died after being shot in the head in 1983			0
" it 's not about whether or not the @entity66 in @entity0 was a mess , " he said			1
" ... it 's about whether or not the defendant is guilty of crimes charged in the indictment			0
" families of the victims were in court every day of the trial			0
the wife of one of the victims shouted " you 're a coward ! " the defense rested its case friday with no rebuttal from the government			2
in its weeklong presentation , @entity7 's lawyers tried to cast doubt on who killed two of the 19 victims , both of them women			1
the defense also attempted to shift the blame onto the @entity66 , specifically agents who either did nothing or did too little to prevent several killings			1
defense attorneys tried to convince the jury that @entity7 was not an @entity66 informant , a notion prosecutors called " ludicrous " in light of his @entity66 informant card and a 700 - page file loaded with " tips " on rival gang members			1
in closing arguments , defense attorney @entity204 told jurors why he thinks the government has made @entity7 's informant status the crux of its case			1
" think about why it 's so important			0
if it 's not an issue , why do they keep bringing it up ? " @entity204 asked			0
@entity204 explained that other than to " embarrass " his client , the government using its claim that @entity7 was an informant to cover up years of corruption			1
" if he 's not an informant , think of the liability , " he said , recounting instance after instance in which government officials as high as strike - force attorneys in the @entity223 protected @entity7 throughout his criminal career			1
a number of retired @entity66 agents and supervisors took the stand during the trial , many testifying that they believed @entity7 should have been shut down as an informant because he was n't providing any useful information			1
the agents said they never pressed the issue because apparently @entity66 headquarters felt @entity7 was useful in taking down the @entity237			1
grisly murders it took prosecutors 90 minutes to detail the 19 murders @entity7 is accused of , showing photos of each of the victims and the crime scenes			1
@entity7 is not charged with delivering the fatal blow in all of the murders , but is charged with participating as part of a racketeering conspiracy			2
@entity67 called @entity7 " the leader of a very wide - ranging , broad organization , " who is culpable for his co-conspirator 's crimes			1
but @entity67 made clear @entity7 was the alleged triggerman in some cases , recalling testimony from @entity7 's partner , @entity259 " @entity258 , about the murder of @entity261 , whose remains were exhumed from a shallow makeshift grave in 2000			1
@entity264 had begun cooperating with the government on the shipment of weapons to the @entity268 and 36 tons of marijuana imported into @entity270			0
" it 's @entity161 all over again , held at gunpoint , chained to the kitchen chair , interrogated , " @entity67 said			0
@entity274 said he was holding @entity264 's body while @entity7 was trying to strangle him with a rope , but the rope was too thick			1
after that did n't work , @entity264 practically begged for a bullet after @entity7 asked him if he would " like one in the head , " according to @entity274			2
@entity274 testified as one of the government 's star witnesses , and he said that he saw @entity7 strangle the two women			1
the defense team , however , presented evidence that @entity274 had the greater motive to kill the women -- his girlfriend and his stepdaughter			2
@entity7 's attorneys release photos designed to show his softer side the girlfriend , @entity295 , was about to leave him for another man			2
the defense recalled @entity80 , who testified that @entity274 admitted he " accidentally strangled " the 26 - year - old woman			1
@entity274 acknowledged he lured @entity299 to a home but says @entity7 strangled her because she was talking too much and had become a liability			0
@entity67 recalled testimony that @entity7 always needed to take a nap after strangling or shooting his victims to death			0
in talking about the murder of @entity307 , @entity67 said @entity7 's former cohorts testified that whenever they passed the @entity309 , where @entity307 's remains were exhumed in 2000 , @entity7 said , " ' drink up , @entity311			2
' that 's the level of humanity that this defendant is operating at			0
... and every time he goes by there it 's ' drink up , @entity311			0
' " victim 's mother warned @entity66 about an impending murder ' @entity7 : i did n't get a fair trial ' @entity7 was a fugitive for more than 16 years , after a crooked @entity66 agent told him in december 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges			1
the @entity66 tracked him down and arrested him 2011 in @entity325 , @entity326 , where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias			0
@entity7 never took the stand , despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify			2
in fact , @entity7 seemed to want to testify , and when questioned about it by the judge , @entity7 called his decision a " choice made involuntarily			0
" he claimed he had been given immunity for his crimes by the former head of @entity342 's @entity341 , @entity340 , now deceased			0
@entity7 , who lost his temper several times during the trial , appeared angry , shaking his finger at the judge and claiming he was " choked off from making an adequate defense			1
" " i did n't get a fair trial			0
do what ya 's want with me , " @entity7 said			2
man arrested in death of alleged @entity7 extortion victim			0
