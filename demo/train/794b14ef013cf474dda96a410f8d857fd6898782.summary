-- imagine that you wake up tomorrow morning and discover that during the night			0
@entity4 planes had conducted a bombing raid on @entity6			1
how would your world have changed ? apart from the sensational headlines and breathless reports , the initial change might not be very significant			0
you would probably want to know whether the @entity11 approved or assisted in the attack on @entity6 's nuclear sites			1
in fact , it does n't really matter			0
just about everyone in the world will assume that the @entity11 was complicit , regardless of what @entity18 says			2
let 's assume that @entity4 notified the @entity22 administration about the same time the planes were taking off , if only to ensure that @entity11 aircraft and missiles in the @entity26 would not interfere with the bombers and refueling aircraft as they passed over one or more @entity30 countries			1
but for @entity6 and just about everyone else , the fact that most of the @entity4 aircraft and bombs were made in the @entity11 would be all they needed to know			1
on that first morning , the @entity35 would convene in emergency session to consider a resolution denouncing the @entity4 raid			1
if the @entity11 vetoed the resolution , that would remove any lingering doubt of @entity11 complicity			2
perhaps more significant , however , would be @entity43 support of the resolution			1
this would signal the beginning of the collapse of the sanctions coalition against @entity6 that had been so laboriously assembled over the past several years			1
both the @entity43 and the @entity11 had operated on the tacit belief that crippling sanctions were an alternative to war			1
with the outbreak of war , that assumption would no longer be valid			0
what would @entity6 do ? everyone would be poised for a massive military response			2
@entity6 would almost certainly give the required 90 days notice of its intention to quit the @entity61 and terminate inspections by the @entity63			2
@entity6 officials would not necessarily announce that they intended to proceed with development of a nuclear weapon , but they would certainly make clear that as a nonnuclear state that had been attacked by another state with nuclear weapons , that was a decision that was entirely up to them			2
all enriched uranium stocks would be removed from @entity63 seal , and all monitoring cameras would be removed			0
a different twist would be introduced if @entity6 had succeeded in shooting down one or more of the @entity4 planes			1
one or more @entity4 pilots in @entity6 hands would sharply increase the risk of further escalation by either the @entity11 or @entity4			1
of more general significance , the markets would realize that some two million barrels a day of @entity6 oil were now removed from the world market for an indeterminate period of time , and the price of oil would jump			1
the head of the @entity91 has suggested that an immediate increase of 20 % to 30 % could be expected			0
but that could be just the beginning			0
it is not hard to imagine that , in the days following the attack , there would suddenly be unexplained pipeline explosions in @entity98 , possibly by @entity100 militias , which might remove another million barrels per day from the market			0
the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) @entity104 from the @entity105 to the @entity106 might also be attacked			0
moreover , one might expect disruptions in oil delivery and loading in @entity30 ports up and down the @entity26 , some because of sabotage but others from cyberattacks on the control systems			0
@entity6 would attribute these to " the hand of @entity117 , " but the more pragmatic effect would be a very substantial portion of the world 's oil suddenly removed from world supply			1
if sustained over more than a few weeks , the scramble to replace large volumes of @entity26 and @entity105 oil would drive up the price of oil , and gasoline , to unprecedented heights			0
that would constitute a huge tax on the world 's economies , just at the moment when they were showing signs of recovery from the @entity138			2
extremely vulnerable economies , such as the southern @entity43 states , could be tipped into bankruptcy , but all states would face significant challenges as a surge in transportation and manufacturing costs rippled through all aspects of their industries			2
this is @entity6 's true weapon of mass destruction			0
regardless of whether @entity6 should choose to retaliate openly against @entity11 forces or @entity4 , it would be extremely difficult for the @entity11 to avoid entering into a third @entity155 war			1
most of the top security officials in the @entity158 have warned against such a war , so the internal opposition in the administration is likely to be great			0
the combination of widespread opposition to @entity6 , however , and the appeal of self - defense would be difficult to resist , particularly in an election year			0
most experts agree that the @entity6 nuclear program can not be eliminated ultimately without an actual military presence on the ground and forcible regime change			1
the @entity11 public , showing real signs of war weariness after two ground wars over more than a decade , is unlikely to be enthusiastic about a military confrontation with @entity6 that is likely to be far more costly and indeterminate than either @entity98 or @entity178			1
that could prompt a public debate about the extent of @entity11 and @entity4 common interests			1
the danger of such an outcome was hinted by @entity4 defense minister @entity185 when he suggested to the @entity186 that " @entity4 should increase its sensitivity , awareness and attentiveness to requirements based on the reality in the @entity11 and adopt a policy that strengthens the special relationship between the two countries			2
" the biggest threat , however , would not be the first day or even the first week after an @entity4 attack			0
the greatest threat might well be the first year or more after an attack , particularly if a major economic crisis was accompanied by growing evidence that @entity6 had proceeded underground and out of sight of the international community to produce a nuclear weapon			2
that would make our present situation , before any attack , look wonderfully attractive by comparison			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			0

@entity211 : if @entity4 bombed @entity6 nuclear sites , most of the world would believe @entity11 was involved
sick : @entity43 would support a @entity35 resolution *condemning* it and likely end @entity6 sanctions
@entity6 would be justified in having nukes , he says ; @entity11 would likely enter another @entity155 war
*fragile* world economies would collapse under *skyrocketing* oil and gas prices , he writes
