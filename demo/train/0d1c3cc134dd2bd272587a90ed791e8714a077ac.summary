-- when i first arrived in @entity3 's capital in 2012 , i deliberately did not visit the @entity4			1
i was n't sure what to expect , but i did not want that experience to influence how i approached the country and its people			2
in my mind , @entity3 was going to be this country that was still on the brink of economic disaster			1
it would be very poorly set up , with a bad road system and difficult telecommunications			2
frankly , i despaired of working with the government , thinking it would be extremely challenging to work with			2
i was a @entity18 in @entity19 and the @entity3 genocide , right on the heels of @entity23 's election in @entity24 , was big news across the continent			1
the child - run household i met after the genocide when i was assigned to @entity3 18 years later , my first thought was the genocide -- this is probably true for most people			1
but when i asked friends and colleagues who had lived there for advice , they spoke highly of the country and her people			2
i started seeing this as another adventure on this continent that i love , though i had visions of the film " @entity48 " resounding in my mind			2
those preconceptions were quickly dispelled once i got there			2
when you get to @entity3 , you are hit by the incongruity that strikes so many : how could such a horrible thing have happened in such a beautiful country ? the nickname @entity3 is not an exaggeration			1
@entity3 's countryside is dotted with what appear to be literally a thousand hills that are a mixture of mountains , volcanoes and hillocks			1
the beauty is reflected in the people : @entity3 are incredibly friendly and hospitable			1
but just as you can not see the other side of a mountain , you can not always tell what is going on behind those eyes			2
@entity3 obey their country 's many rules			1
i love that , to reduce pollution , plastic bags are forbidden and even taken from you when you arrive at the airport ! for anyone who has spent time in @entity24 , it 's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles , drivers and passengers alike , both in @entity4 and in the countryside			1
national pride and a commitment to the idea that @entity3 should lead the development of their country are strong			1
from them came the concept of @entity93 , or community service			2
during the last saturday of each month , citizens do some type of community work in their neighborhood , like picking up garbage or cutting the grass			2
if they do not show up , they 're fined an amount determined by the neighborhood leader			0
( these days the neighborhoods are like anywhere else : some are made up of different tribes and ethnicities and others are homogenous			0
) amid the beautiful parks and tea plantations are the somber genocide memorials found in virtually every community			1
they serve as a daily reminder to never forget the atrocities			0
at the same time , they allow for personal reflection on mankind 's capacity for both evil and resilience			1
four months after my arrival , i was ready to see the @entity4			0
i was glad i had waited			0
you walk alongside slabs of cement : a mass grave where over 250,000 people killed in @entity4 are buried			0
at the end of one of the cement tombs is a wall with names , an attempt to identify some of the souls lost during the tragic 100 days of the genocide			1
you almost weep when you realize they will never identify them all			0
one room tells the tale of other genocides or " cleansing " events in history around the world , reminding us that the international community has not been diligent about the oft - quoted pledge , " never again			1
" and in the room dedicated to children who were killed -- you see their names , what they enjoyed doing and who was their best friend -- your heart starts to tear			0
i was never able to actually read all the remembrances to these children			0
though i have always considered myself a pretty tough and realistic humanitarian worker , i had never seen anything like this			1
a single visit ensures that the memorial realizes its purpose -- you will never forget			0
it 's an experience that makes you wonder how any society can come back together after something that tears so deeply			0
but i know from what i had seen , and from my organization 's work , that it is possible			0
many genocide survivors and perpetrators have since been able to seek and grant forgiveness and now live peacefully , side by side			2
i watched a woman tear up and embrace a man who had killed her family			0
witnessing these scenes is almost surreal , but deeply moving and humbling			0
could i ever forgive ? could i ever confess and ask for forgiveness ? looking at @entity3 today with a certainty that such an atrocity can never happen again , you wonder " how did this ever happen in the first place ? " when @entity3 say " never again , " i believe them			1
but when i look at the international community , those words do n't have the same meaning			0
are we really a community in which most of us watched this suffering and death from the sidelines ? it will happen again somewhere else			0
we 've seen it in history			0
in march of this year , i was asked to head our program in the @entity201			0
the lessons from @entity3 still echoing in my head , i was compelled to say " yes " to a country being torn apart by intercommunal fighting , just as @entity3 had been			1
my time in @entity3 has shown me the limitations of what the international community will do in situations like this , but also taught me lessons and given me hope			1
just 20 years ago , @entity3 went through genocide , but they came back and they came back quickly			1
i attribute a lot of that to the strong will , the leadership and most importantly , to the resiliency of the @entity3 people			1
i pray that we can realize the same here in @entity201			0
and we can , with a little influence and a lot of political will .			0
