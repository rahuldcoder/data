-- @entity1 , whose leader @entity2 died over the weekend , is the least democratic nation on @entity4 , according to a newly released report by a @entity7 analysis and intelligence firm			1
the @entity9 2011 , compiled by the @entity10 , listed @entity11 as the most democratic nation in the world			1
the top 10 spots in this year 's index were occupied mostly by @entity17 countries			1
following @entity11 were : @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26			1
read the full report the @entity28 ranked 19th , down two spots from the 2010 listing			1
the @entity28 ' 2011 ranking is below @entity24 ( 8th ) and the @entity7 ( 18th )			1
the @entity28 also ranked below the @entity32 ( 16th ) , a former @entity34 communist satellite that did not become a democracy until 1989 , and the @entity37 nation of @entity38 ( 17th ) , a former right - wing dictatorship that did not return to democracy until 1984			1
the @entity10 analysis , released this month , concluded that democracy deteriorated in 48 countries , improved in 41 and stayed the same in 78			2
in most regions , the report said , the level of democracy was lower in 2011 than the previous year			1
" 2011 was an exceptionally turbulent year , characterized by sovereign debt crises and weak political leadership in the developed world , dramatic political change and conflict in the @entity56 and @entity57 and rising social unrest , " said @entity49 , the report 's lead author			1
the @entity9 is based on five categories : electoral process and pluralism , civil liberties , how government functions , political participation by the public , and political culture			2
the analysts measured the level of democracy in 165 nations and two territories , " which account for almost the entire population of the world , " the @entity10 said in a release			2
using a scale of 0 to 10 , countries were placed in one of four categories : full democracies ( 8 - 10 ) , flawed democracies ( 6 to 7.9 ) , hybrid regimes ( 4 to 5.9 ) and authoritarian regimes ( 0 to 3.9 )			2
@entity11 , the top - ranked nation , had a score of 9.8			1
the @entity83 nation also ranked no. 1 in 2010 with an identical score			1
@entity1 , ranked no. 167 , had a score of 1.08			2
the @entity88 nation also ranked last in 2010 , with the same score			1
the @entity28 had a score of 8.11 , slightly lower than last year 's 8.18			1
" @entity28 democracy has been adversely affected by a deepening of the polarization of the political scene and political brinkmanship and paralysis , " the @entity10 concluded			1
the analysts noted that the @entity28 and the @entity7 lag behind many other full democracies for some of the same reasons			1
" there has been a rise in protest movements , " the report states			1
" problems in the functioning of government have become more prominent			2
" among other findings in the report : -- slightly more than half the world 's population lives in some type of democracy , although only 11 % enjoy a " full democracy			1
" -- more than one - third of the globe 's population lives under authoritarian rule			2
-- nearly half the nations on the planet are considered democracies : 25 " full " and 53 " flawed			2
" -- there were 37 " hybrid regimes " and 52 " authoritarian regimes			2
" -- violence , drug trafficking and other crime in @entity127 continue to hinder democracy			0
-- @entity129 continued to suffer a decline in democracy , with 12 nations worse than the previous year			0
-- @entity133 also had a decline in democracy , with seven nations deteriorating and none improving			0
some of that deterioration was due to financial problems plaguing the eurozone			0
five of the countries that lost points in the rankings belong to the eurozone : @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			0
-- eight countries had a listing change from one type of government to another in 2011			0
@entity156 were upgraded and four were downgraded			0
-- countries that deteriorated were : @entity148 ( fell from full to flawed democracy ) , @entity160 and @entity161 ( flawed democracy to hybrid regime ) and @entity164 ( hybrid to authoritarian regime )			0
-- @entity167 improved from a hybrid to a flawed democracy			0
@entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 moved up from authoritarian to hybrid			0
