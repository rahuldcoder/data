-- legalizing marijuana is a civil rights issue , according to one of @entity6 's most prominent @entity5 advocacy groups			1
the @entity7 of the @entity8 , led by president @entity9 , recently announced its " unconditional endorsement " for @entity11 , a legislative initiative on the november ballot that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana in @entity6			1
@entity9 said @entity5 - @entity14 are disproportionately affected by the criminalization of marijuana which makes passing the law a civil rights issue			1
" we have empirical proof that the application of the marijuana laws has been unfairly applied to our young people of color , " @entity9 said in an official statement			0
" justice is the quality of being just and fair and these laws have been neither just nor fair			0
" police departments in @entity6 have made more than 60,000 marijuana possession arrests in 2008 , three times more than in 1990 , according to a recent study released by the @entity33 organization that says it promotes policies to end the war on drugs			2
although blacks and @entity39 make up less than 44 percent of the state 's population , together both ethnic groups constitute up to 56 percent of arrests that are made for marijuana possession in @entity6 , according to the study			1
furthermore , the @entity14 @entity44 has found that african - americans use marijuana at lower rates than white @entity14 across the country			1
the study said arrests in @entity6 are " racially - biased " and have led to a " system - wide phenomenon , occurring in every county and nearly every police department in @entity6 , and elsewhere			2
" @entity54 , vice president of advocacy for the @entity8 , said these numbers make it a civil rights issue			2
" we are usually conservative in terms of the issues that we support , but disproportionate prosecution of [ african - americans for ] drug - related offenses for marijuana has called us to fight for decriminalization in our community			1
" " if the law on drug possession was being enforced correctly , then the number of arrests and prosecutions and prison sentences would be proportionate to our society across the board , " @entity68 said			0
" sadly , that 's not the picture			0
" but some african - americans do n't think the solution to the problem is to legalize marijuana			1
bishop @entity83 , an outspoken leader of the @entity84 and member of the @entity8 , is outraged by the endorsement			2
he , along with 24 other faith - and activist - based organizations held a press conference in @entity6 wednesday , calling for the resignation of @entity9 , claiming the @entity6 @entity8 's endorsement of marijuana legislation is selling out the @entity5 - @entity5 community			1
" if you think you are a civil rights leader , you should know better than anyone not to open the door to laws that will poison our community , " @entity83 said			0
but @entity9 's endorsement has been backed by other organizations that support civil rights , including @entity104 , the @entity104			0
however , @entity83 believes that by supporting this initiative , @entity9 is giving the @entity8 " a black eye			0
" " we agree that the disproportionate arrests should change , but legalizing marijuana is not the way , " @entity83 said			1
" what it will create is for more incarceration , more drug babies , and more crime on the street			0
this is not a civil rights issue			0
" @entity83 , a former drug addict , said marijuana is a gateway drug that causes violence in poor communities and impedes the education of @entity5 youth			1
the @entity6 @entity8 " does not speak for the majority of the @entity5 - @entity5 community in this country , " @entity83 said			1
" what we need to do is support initiatives that help the black male progress in education and job placement			0
" " how do you educate a mind that is intoxicated ? " in addition , @entity83 said , revenue raised from legalizing and taxing marijuana sales would not end up serving is community			2
" to raise the $ 100 billion that would be needed to fund education in this state , the use of marijuana would have to increase by 20 to 40 percent , " he said			0
" this is a smokescreen and it 's blood money			0
" but @entity68 said @entity9 's stand against criminalization supports @entity8 founding principles			2
" what the @entity6 state conference is trying to do is simply what is rooted in our mission : to eliminate racial prejudice wherever it may be , " @entity68 said			2
" if members of our own community are able to see this as not just a drug issue , but a civil rights issue , i think individuals across the nation will reconsider their views on the marijuana legislation			1
" the decision on @entity11 will be made in @entity6 in november .			0
