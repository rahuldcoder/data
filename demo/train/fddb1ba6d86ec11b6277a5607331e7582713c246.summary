-- early on tuesday morning , two @entity2 men from the @entity4 neighborhood of @entity5 entered a synagogue in the sleepy @entity8 neighborhood of @entity9 and went on a killing spree			0
armed with guns and knives , the two men killed four rabbis -- three @entity16 - @entity15 and one @entity16 - @entity17 -- before they were struck down by @entity16 police			1
the attack , which also claimed the life of a police officer , was the deadliest in a series of recent " lone wolf " attacks against @entity16 across @entity4			1
the @entity16 response was swift			1
the @entity16 military ordered the demolition of the perpetrators ' homes			1
@entity16 border police blocked access to several @entity4 neighborhoods that have been recent flash points for conflict			2
and @entity16 security services conducted raids in several towns in the @entity38			2
@entity16 prime minister @entity39 condemned the attacks and hammered @entity2 leader @entity41 for inciting the ongoing violence in @entity4			1
similarly , @entity15 secretary of state @entity43 condemned the " senseless brutality , " and called on @entity41 to do the same			1
it was his first condemnation of any attack in @entity4 since the unrest began last month			2
indeed , the aging @entity2 leader is walking a tightrope			0
on the one hand , lone wolves are by definition not under the control of @entity41 nor other @entity2 political organizations			1
and it is also true that @entity41 has not been the driving force of the @entity4 unrest			1
but at the same time , he does appear to be making an effort to benefit from the tensions , seemingly seeking to ride this current wave of nationalist fervor			0
yet @entity41 is also operating from a political place of strength			2
the @entity8 trusts him because he brought an end to the violence of the second intifada , or uprising ( 2000 - 2005 )			0
the @entity16 need him because his forces in the @entity38 cooperate with the @entity16 on a range of security issues			2
in many ways , @entity41 is responsible for preventing a third intifada in the @entity38 -- the territory he controls			0
however , both @entity16 and the @entity15 have badly mismanaged the relationship with the @entity75 , doubling down on a system that has failed to invest in @entity2 good governance , let alone new leadership			1
as a result , neither have much leverage to tone down his rhetoric , short of threatening to oust him from power			0
ultimately , though , there is also the question of whether the @entity2 leader actually has the ability to bring stability back to @entity4			0
even though @entity2 claim the city as their capital , @entity4 is outside of @entity41 ' jurisdiction			0
moreover , @entity41 is now nine years into a four - year term , and his popularity is flagging			0
the 79 - year - old @entity41 may be thinking about his legacy after nearly a decade of failed peace talks and internecine squabbles that have divided the @entity2 people , both politically and geographically			0
the key question is whether @entity41 believes he can resuscitate his political fortunes on the @entity2 street by supporting the @entity4 unrest			1
if he does , the path to de-escalation is clouded			0
if @entity41 is not the answer , the trick for @entity15 and @entity16 policymakers is identifying who else to engage			1
and it is far from clear who that person might be .			0
