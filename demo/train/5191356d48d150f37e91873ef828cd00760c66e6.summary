-- the federal lawsuit filed by @entity3 gov. @entity2 on behalf of the state against the @entity5 is politically smart			1
it is never a bad thing for a state lawmaker to stand behind the flagship university , especially when the lawmaker himself is under investigation for his alleged complicity in protracting the official inquiry of @entity14			0
but legally , the lawsuit makes no sense			1
recall the events : @entity21 , in the midst of the national scandal stemming from the crimes of @entity14 , agreed to settle any claims that the @entity5 might have against it for failure to supervise its football program			1
the settlement was undeniably harsh , including a fine of $ 60 million , loss of scholarships and bowl eligibility for four years , and the easing of rules to allow student - athletes to transfer out of @entity21 's football program			2
( meanwhile , outside of the settlement , the criminal trials of key university administrators for perjury and failure to report abuse are proceeding			0
) like most plea bargains , the perpetrator got something from the deal , too			0
by settling early , the university avoided the prolonged @entity5 infractions process			2
proceeding by the infractions process would have kept @entity21 's name , @entity14 's crimes and @entity51 's dubious legacy in the news longer than usual			2
more alarmingly , the infractions committee could have imposed the dreaded " death penalty " -- a complete termination of the football program for years , the cost of which would have undoubtedly dwarfed the measures imposed			0
notably , @entity21 agreed in accepting the deal that it would not challenge the @entity5 's authority in court			1
@entity2 described the sanctions as " overreaching and unlawful " while other lawmakers object to the fines being used to fund programs in other states			1
since the @entity69 of @entity3 was not limited by the @entity21 - @entity5 agreement , it can sue to overturn it			1
yet it is that very fact -- that @entity3 is a stranger to the agreement -- that dooms its litigation			0
the lawsuit asks the court to grant an injunction so that @entity5 can be refrained from imposing the sanctions			1
injunctions look to the future and are designed to prevent damages			0
typically , an injunction plaintiff claims that something bad is about to happen and asks the court to stop it			0
what bad thing will happen to @entity3 ? it partially funds @entity21			2
therefore , according to the complaint , future @entity5 sanctions that come out of the @entity21 treasury will , by derivation , also be taken from @entity3 's treasury , or at least the part of it that the state chooses to share with the university			1
in other words , @entity3 is claiming that it will be injured by its decision to contribute money to the university			0
if it is so keen to prevent itself from being harmed , why does n't the state simply refuse to give money to the school until the sanctions period has expired ? @entity3 will not be injured by the @entity5 's sanctions ; it will be injured by its own decision to fund the university			1
no federal judge is going to find otherwise			0
i strongly suspect @entity3 's lawyers are well aware of the fundamental absurdity of their lawsuit			0
that is why the complaint repeatedly alludes to the losses that other people and parties will suffer from the @entity5 sanctions ; those others include local businesses , other students and sports teams at the university , season - ticket holders and the numerous merchandise vendors who profit from the financial success of this greatest - of - all revenue sports			1
yet none of those other people would likely have standing to sue , so their inclusion only underscores the state 's untenable litigation position			0
at times , the complaint filed by the state reads less like a legal document and more like a press release , extolling the fine virtues of a @entity21 education amidst the hard - working townsfolk of central @entity3			1
the complaint also strangely paints the @entity5 in starkly negative hues , as if associating the organization with greed and its leadership with conspiracy will somehow make a difference			2
it goes so far as to smear the @entity5 president for his handsome salary , noting that it constitutes a substantial raise over that of his predecessor			2
this lawsuit will probably not get past the motion to dismiss			0
the high point of the suit in @entity3 's eyes is now ; get your shots in while you can			0
but imagine that @entity3 actually litigates to a successful conclusion and has the consent decree between @entity21 and the @entity5 overturned			1
what then ? the @entity5 can simply reopen the case and refer the matter to the infractions process , with the penalty of death the likely outcome for @entity21 's @entity166			1
if @entity51 were still here , he would tell you : sometimes it 's smarter to punt			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

gov. @entity2 filed a lawsuit against @entity5 over sanctions on @entity21
@entity173 : the lawsuit is smart politically , but makes no sense legally
he says complaint reads less like a legal document , more like a press release
@entity173 : even if lawsuit were successful , @entity5 can reopen the case
