favored haunt of @entity2 , gamblers , luxury yacht owners and @entity6 fans , @entity0 looks increasingly set to also become the preferred destination of any self - respecting world class footballer			1
and who can blame them			0
what 's not to like about the chance to strut your stuff in one of the world 's most glamorous locations -- and not pay tax on your wages			1
@entity0 have come a long way in a very short space of time and , with the money the club 's @entity26 owner @entity25 has to spend , it is a team that has every chance of upsetting the status quo in @entity31 football next season			1
when @entity25 -- worth $ 9.1 billion , according to @entity33 -- bought a majority stake in the seven - time @entity31 champions in december 2011 , @entity0 were bottom of @entity31 football 's second tier			1
fast forward a couple of years and @entity0 have served notice of the extent of their ambitions by spending close to $ 180 million on signing @entity45 striker @entity44 , as well as @entity47 pair @entity46 and @entity48			2
this , just a matter of weeks after wrapping up the second - flight title , with a young side coached by experienced @entity54 @entity53			0
" it 's hard to think of a more serious statement of intent , " former @entity0 chief executive @entity55 told @entity56			2
" @entity44 is simply the best out - and - out center forward in the world			0
with a signing of this caliber ( @entity65 's experienced @entity64 defender @entity63 will also play for @entity0 next season ) , @entity31 football will seriously start closing the gap on the top @entity71 leagues			1
" these are signings that are likely to give newly crowned @entity31 champions @entity74 , another club revived by massive investment , a run for their money in defending their @entity79 title			2
" everything is possible , " said @entity55			0
" the team that won @entity82 -- even without the new acquisitions -- would have stabilized itself in the top eight of @entity79			0
" but one should allow for the team to settle in the top half of @entity79 before expecting silverware , " added @entity55 , who left @entity0 in february after just over a year at the club			2
@entity0 's upwardly mobile progression evokes memories of @entity92 's transformation after another @entity26 billionaire @entity93 took control in 2003			1
in financial peril before the @entity26 oligarch arrived , @entity92 's trophy cabinet room is now brim to overflowing with 11 cups captured in the space of 10 years during the @entity93 era			2
though at a no little cost			0
@entity93 has gone through nine managers , not to mention an estimated $ 1.5 billion of investment in players and wages			2
when @entity93 took charge of @entity92 , @entity53 was in charge of the team , but was sacked after one season and replaced by @entity110 -- despite having led the club to second in the @entity112 and to the semifinals of the @entity114			0
" @entity53 is an excellent manager , " said @entity55 , who stepped down from the chief executive role before the club 's promotion due to personal reasons			2
" he was -- and , in my opinion , still is -- the ideal manager for this project			0
" the experience , the class , the professionalism he brought has been immensely important , " added @entity55 , who had previously been @entity0 's sporting director before his promotion to the chief executive role in september			1
" he is very pragmatic , is aware of the politics of the game and just as importantly he 's a great ambassador			0
" not that @entity0 's " grand projet " has been universally welcomed by all in @entity31 football			1
under the principality 's laws , foreigners do not pay tax on their wages and that has put @entity0 at odds with the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) and the @entity140 ( @entity141 ) after the latter organization ruled that the club must move their head office to @entity31 by the start of june next year			1
" @entity0 has enjoyed a position in @entity31 football that is totally unfair and that has n't been questioned , " @entity148 's @entity147 correspondent @entity146 told @entity56			1
" the club has enjoyed an unfair advantage over every @entity31 club			2
@entity0 should be subjected to the same tax regime as the other clubs in @entity79 , " added @entity146 , who acknowledged that the @entity31 football authorities have allowed this anomaly to go on for too long			1
" in any other country this would be unthinkable			0
imagine if @entity162 clubs @entity160 and @entity163 did n't operate under the same taxation regime as the other 18 @entity112 clubs ? " the league has a perfect right to ask @entity0 for this and the law should have been applied a long time ago			0
" but @entity0 are refusing to play ball and have threatened to take legal action over the dispute			0
" as part of this legal action , @entity0 will be seeking the annulment of the @entity141 's decision of march 21 requiring the club to establish its headquarters in @entity31 , as well as a claim for damages from the @entity141 as compensation for financial and commercial losses suffered as a result of that decision , " @entity0 said in a statement earlier this month			1
@entity0 said @entity185 president @entity184 , " acting on behalf of both the @entity139 and the @entity141 , demanded from @entity0 a huge payment of $ 258 million in return for ending the current conflict without the club having to relocate its headquarters to @entity31 in order to remain in the @entity191			1
" neither @entity184 or the @entity141 responded to @entity56 's request for comment			0
the @entity139 then issued a statement , insisting it was @entity0 who brought up the figure			1
" the @entity139 had decided ( on april 18 ) to set up a meeting between the @entity139 , the @entity198 ( @entity141 ) and @entity0			1
preliminary talks started with representatives from @entity0 , during which the sum of $ 258 million was mentioned by @entity0 , " said the @entity139			1
" my personal opinion is that @entity0 has been treated disgracefully by the @entity31 football authorities , " said @entity55			1
" what @entity0 are doing is to the wider benefit of the @entity31 game			1
" @entity31 football should welcome this foreign investment -- it makes the league stronger , improves the competitive balance and brings much - needed global exposure			0
" @entity55 suggested that the @entity31 authorities were in danger of " shooting themselves in the foot , " pointing out that when he was working for the club , @entity0 had spent $ 6.4 million on @entity217 from @entity218			1
" at the time @entity218 were struggling financially and on the brink of going out of business			0
" before the signing of @entity44 , @entity46 and @entity48 , i suspect the strategy had been to sign mainly @entity31 players from the domestic transfer market , but the club may well have reversed that strategy due to the scandalously poor treatment they have recently received from the @entity31 football authorities			2
" before @entity25 's arrival , @entity0 had been regular participants in @entity71 club competition until a steady decline set in , culminating in their relegation to @entity82 in 2011			1
" @entity25 is very analytical and studious , " said @entity55 of his former boss			0
" he comes from a family of doctors and that is the way he has built his businesses -- by careful analysis			0
" he 's an avid student of the game			0
whenever you go to his office you 'll always find analytical books on the subject of football on his table , i 'm obviously not talking about books like ' @entity252 , ' " said @entity55 , referring to @entity241 's book about football fandom			0
" he is very knowledgeable about football and for him the strategy is quite simple -- to be successful , " added the @entity253 , who before joining @entity0 as technical director in january 2012 worked as a scout for @entity257			0
" since he took over , the financial commitment has been amazing			0
" he has always delivered on his promise to be successful and he wo n't settle for second best			0
" however given @entity0 's average attendance last season was just over 5,000 , the question remains how @entity0 will meet @entity266 's @entity265 rules , which requires clubs to only spend money they earn , if and when the principality club qualifies for @entity266			1
for now , though , those few thousand @entity0 supporters can look forward to the treat of watching some of @entity266 's finest players .			2
