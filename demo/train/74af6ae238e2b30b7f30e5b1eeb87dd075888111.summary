@entity0 , @entity1 -- under heavy criticism for a telling cell phone carriers to ban certain words in text messages , the @entity3 went into damage control mode wednesday			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity9 denied the existence of the plan , which has met with derision from mobile phone users in the country			1
" if at all we finally decide to go for this process , then we will prepare a list in consultation with the mobile operators , " @entity15 told @entity2			0
in another conversation with @entity2 two days earlier , however , @entity15 acknowledged that the telecommunications authority had sent out a notice to carriers -- but said that the agency was giving the operators more time to come up with a shorter list			0
earlier this week , three carriers -- @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 -- received the notice , officials there confirmed			0
in it , the @entity3 , which regulates cell phone and internet carriers in @entity1 , called on them to implement the ban within seven days			1
this would mean blocking text messages containing the offending words			2
most of the 1,500 banned words were deemed sexually explicit or obscene by the @entity3 , the officials said			1
the words include " taxi " -- often used to refer to prostitutes in @entity1 -- " gay , " " tongue , " " homosexual , " " intercourse , " " condom " and " hole			2
" @entity2 has obtained a copy of the list			0
in the notice , which is available online , the @entity3 cited a law that bans the transmission of indecent and obscene messages			0
the notice says the banned words are part of an effort to cut down on spam and unsolicited text messages , the officials said			1
last month , the @entity3 banned thousands of websites containing pornography			0
but the latest about face on text messages appears to mean the @entity3 will not act on the notice -- at least , any time soon .			2

@entity1 tells phone *companies* to block 1,500 words from text messages
cell phone users *respond* with derision
the @entity3 sends mixed messages on its plan
the banned words list includes terms related to sex and prostitution
