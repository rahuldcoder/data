-- a single mother of six , @entity1 brought her 3 - month - old daughter to be immunized at @entity4 , one free clinic offering medical care to @entity7 's disadvantaged			1
" since i am unemployed at the moment and was in between having @entity9 insurance , i found out about this place ( and ) i was able to get all the immunizations that my children needed , " she says			1
" it 's a great opportunity to have health care when you are not able to afford it			2
" with the advent of @entity20 , the health market is changing			1
@entity21 , @entity4 director , has wondered how the @entity20 would change the clinic 's mission			2
" i ask ( clients ) every day if they will be signing up for @entity20 and they look at me with a blank stare , " she says			2
she explains that @entity7 's economically disadvantaged , who make up an overwhelming majority of her clients , do not know much about the @entity20			1
most are extremely isolated from current events			0
few own televisions and even fewer have internet access			0
because of that , she expects most of her clients to stay with the clinic			0
however , she worries about its future and the potential for dwindling donations			0
most nonprofit donors assume low - income populations will register for @entity41 , so donations are n't necessary			2
however , many may not qualify for @entity20			1
as a result , many free - care providers -- which have been , and still are , the cornerstone of health care services for the indigent -- face an uncertain future			2
" when the @entity20 passed in 2010 , there was an immediate assumption that no one is going to need the free clinic , " says @entity49 , executive director of the @entity50			1
@entity49 has had to work hard to educate her donors on popular misconceptions about @entity20			1
her first task was to clarify that having an insurance card was not a panacea that made the services offered by her nonprofits redundant			0
even patients with @entity9 still look to free clinics to fill the gaps for services like dental care			1
@entity68 is one of the states that refused the expansion of @entity9 under @entity20			1
so people fall in the gap -- those who do n't qualify for @entity9 or @entity20			1
meanwhile , the number of patients attending free clinics has not decreased , staying the same or even rising			1
those who make too much to qualify for support and too little to afford care are left in a coverage gray area			1
according to @entity49 , this group is now flocking to free clinics			1
it 's a trend seen elsewhere as well			0
" regardless of a @entity9 expansion ... we will still have more uninsured people in @entity89 than the free clinics currently serve , " says @entity84 , ceo of the @entity85			1
in @entity89 , free clinics served 75,000 people in 2012 , @entity91 says			1
she expects that 280,000 individuals will remain uninsured , even with @entity9 expansion			2
@entity97 , the largest provider of its kind in @entity91 's region , serves 1,700 of @entity101 's working poor each year			0
in @entity114 , " even with all of the great expectation and positive feelings ... there will still be well over half a million residents of @entity110 five years from now who will not have benefited from the @entity20 for a number of reasons , " says @entity102 , executive director of @entity103 , the largest free medical clinic in @entity105			1
in 2013 alone , her clinic served 11,500 unique patients			2
many of those return multiple times , totaling an average of 30,000 visits			0
" it is really difficult and often emotional for ( health care providers ) as they hear from our patients who are desperately asking if they can stay here , " @entity102 says			2
her group continues working with patients until they are fully enrolled and have found a new medical home			2
as a result , the clinic remains in a state of flux as it transitions out the eligible patients to other service providers while making room for those who are left with no options			0
as many as 29 million documented and undocumented people are still without access to health insurance , @entity139 , executive director of the @entity140 , testified last february before the @entity141			0
this figure includes those who are eligible for @entity9 but reside in states which choose not to expand their programs			2
many people do not realize that since the 1960s , about 1,200 free and charitable clinics nationwide have been filling in the gaps for those who fall through the cracks , @entity139 told lawmakers			1
back in @entity68 , @entity151 , a single mom with two kids , has been coming to @entity4 for the last five years			0
she says her 6 - and 9 - year - old sons receive the best care there			0
the children qualify for @entity9 , she says , but she is still awaiting approval			1
during the application process , she was told she herself did not qualify			0
@entity151 is not looking forward to any changes that @entity20 may bring			2
" everything i have heard has been negative ( and ) i do n't think it 's a good plan , " she says			0
meanwhile , 19 - year - old @entity162 , who is homeless with no source of income , is staying at @entity165 , an organization that cares for homeless youth			0
she had nowhere else to go , she says			0
@entity167 receives medical care at @entity4			0
" right now my eyes are terrible			0
my stress is causing pain in my body , " she says			0
" it 's hard to get back on my feet when i am sick			0
" confusion over @entity20 has created ample work for @entity177 , outreach and advocacy director at @entity180 for a @entity181 , a nonprofit group aimed at providing " a strong voice for @entity68 consumers and communities on the health care issues and decisions that impact their lives , " according to its website			1
@entity177 's job is to travel around the state and translate exactly what @entity20 means for individuals			2
the hardest questions she faces come from those who earn too much to qualify for @entity9 and not enough to qualify for @entity20			1
" it is difficult for them to fully understand that ( @entity9 expansion ) is a state decision and unless it changes , unfortunately , they are not going to have a coverage option , " she says			1
@entity177 consistently finds herself recommending providers like @entity4 as the best option for this group			0
@entity4 and other clinics remain dedicated to working with their patients regardless of @entity20 's impact			1
" because of the clinic , i have one less thing to worry about , " @entity151 says			0
follow @entity209 on @entity210 .			0

free clinics worry that donors will *dry* up because of @entity20
many make too much to qualify for @entity9 and not enough to get coverage
even @entity9 patients look to the clinics to fill gaps in care
