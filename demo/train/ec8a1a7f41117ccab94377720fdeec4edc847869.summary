even @entity3 macaques are getting into the game			0
in 2011 , two of these @entity7 monkeys borrowed photographer @entity9 's camera and reportedly snapped some pictures of themselves			2
one of the selfies by a female macaque has since gone viral , making its way to @entity16 's free - to - use website			1
@entity9 asked the site to take down the photo , but @entity16 asserts the photo is uncopyrightable because animals ca n't own copyrights			1
it raises two interesting questions : first , can a monkey even acquire copyright in a selfie ? second , can a human acquire copyright in a monkey 's selfie ? it 's a depressing idea , that the terabytes of gratuitous selfies snapped by vapid 20 - somethings -- serving no other artistic purpose than showing off their outfit or their abs on @entity39 -- would be entitled to copyright protection			1
meanwhile , a one - of - a - kind " selfie " by a downright adorable monkey , might not be entitled to protection			1
but the law -- international and domestic -- is full of grim irony			2
in the @entity49 , to qualify for copyright protection , a work ( the photograph ) must meet three criteria : ( 1 ) it must be fixed in a tangible medium : no problem here			1
photographs are a classic example of fixation in a tangible medium , just like paint on a canvas or doodles in a textbook			1
this is easily satisfied by our simian			0
( 2 ) it must be " original			2
" the @entity67 has observed that this means possessing a shred of creative spark , no matter how crude , humble or obvious it might be			0
there 's an important distinction to be made here , however : animals might be capable of original works , but mere works of nature can not qualify			1
a tortoiseshell or an ostrich egg is created by a living creature , and may be more symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing than many of the wacky sculptures gracing our federal buildings			0
but they are the result of survival or procreation , not a creative choice			0
therefore , these animal creations are not original -- at least under copyright law			1
on the other hand , some animals do express themselves creatively , and with that minimal degree of creativity required by the law			1
it 's just hard to say where we draw the line on the evolutionary scale			0
a finger - painting gorilla is likely expressing originality , but if you dip a beetle in ink and let him walk around on paper , is the beetle showing his creative spark ? or is he simply trying to flee ? overall , originality is a low threshold , and probably satisfied by the macaque 's selfie			2
it 's also a purely academic discussion , because while some animals ' work may be original , unfortunately for aspiring macaques , no animal can ever be an " author			1
" which brings us to ... ( 3 ) the work must have an " author			1
" in the @entity49 , the term " authorship " implies that the work must owe its origin to a human being			1
materials produced solely by nature , by plants , or by animals are not copyrightable			2
similarly , in the @entity136 , an author must be a " person			0
" the bottom line is that monkeys may create works of art , but those works can not qualify for copyright protection			1
so , can humans acquire rights in works created by animals ? one view would be that ( a ) if animals are your property , and ( b ) they create property , then ( c ) the property of your property is also your property			0
a dairy farmer owns the egg laid by a chicken ; kittens become the property of the owner of the cat that birthed them			0
unfortunately for the photographer here , copyright ownership does not work the way ownership does on the farm			1
because the monkey can not create a copyrightable work , that work can never be copyrightable			2
on the other hand , if the photographer takes a work by an animal and turns it into an ink - blotted , @entity175 - inspired piece of pop art , then he acquires rights in the new creation			0
but in the case of a monkey 's selfie by itself , that photograph immediately and forever falls into the public domain , and can be used by anyone , without permission			2
society 's view of animals has certainly evolved over the years			0
in fact , it has evolved so much that it creates public confusion			0
the concept of " animal rights " is a compassionate one , but it also runs counter to our current legal view of animals			0
animal lovers routinely ascribe human qualities to their beloved pets , and animal rights activists will burn a columnist in effigy for daring to suggest that a dog should n't vote or drive a bus			0
for now , whether you consider monkeys to be property or peer , their pictures can not qualify for protection in the @entity213			2
in the case of copyright , that which is created by @entity216 , is owned by @entity216 -- which is to say it is owned , not by one of us , but all of us .			0

@entity223 : photog whose camera used in viral monkey selfie wants it off @entity16
photo is uncopyrightable , says @entity16 because animals ca n't own copyright . but can they ?
@entity49 copyright law holds work must be in tangible medium , be original and have author
@entity223 : animals are n't authors . this selfie does n't qualify for copyright protection
