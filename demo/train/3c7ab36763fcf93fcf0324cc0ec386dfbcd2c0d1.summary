-- @entity1 is supposed to be about drivers racing fast cars , but this season it seems to be all about the tires			0
there have been complaints from teams and drivers , with an official investigation also underway over a development test , while the latest twist involves @entity11 putting its plan on hold to introduce new race tires at next month 's @entity15			1
instead , each of the 22 drivers will be given two sets of development medium compound tires to try out during the first practice session at the @entity21 in @entity22 on 7 june			1
a statement by the @entity25 manufacturer explained : " the @entity1 teams will have an opportunity to test the new range of @entity11 tires during free practice at the @entity31 @entity15 , while the tires used for the actual race will remain in their original 2013 specification			1
" following feedback from the teams and drivers , the new specification of tire is then set to be introduced from the @entity39 @entity15 at the end of june , and will remain in place until the end of the year			1
" often dismissed by the sport 's protagonists as the " black things in the corners , " those spheres of rubber have very much moved to @entity1 's center stage			0
after the last race in @entity52 , it emerged that @entity53 , who won the race thanks to @entity56 , faced an official investigation over whether it carried out an illegal tire test			1
the @entity60 team , who are based in @entity62 , @entity63 , helped @entity11 carry out a three - day tire test in @entity65 immediately after the @entity66 @entity15 but controversially the team used race drivers @entity56 and @entity69 and their 2013 car			1
in may , @entity11 had asked the sport 's ruling body -- the @entity71 -- if it could carry out testing with an @entity1 team			1
the sport 's rules state that 1,000 kilometers of testing with any marque is allowed during the season -- as long as every team is offered that opportunity			0
but rival teams @entity81 and @entity83 protested to the @entity71 , arguing the @entity65 test contravened the rule banning in - season testing			2
the @entity71 is now investigating the matter but neither the governing body or @entity11 expect a resolution before the @entity31 gp			1
even prior to @entity52 , tires had already been drawing plenty of heat			0
@entity81 and their triple world champion @entity92 complained the 2013 rubber meant they could not push the car to the limits of its top - speed because the tires had to be so carefully managed			0
there were further criticisms after the @entity66 @entity15 was won by @entity83 's @entity101 on a four - stop strategy			2
like @entity66 , the race on @entity31 's temporary race circuit , which combines high - speed straights and slow corners , could well see teams make multiple pit - stops			1
there were also more serious safety concerns following a spate of delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- which affected @entity69 , @entity114 and @entity116 's cars			2
@entity11 wants to introduce new tires that are not prone to dangerous delaminations as quickly as possible			1
the @entity25 company is also aware it must protect its image both for its road car clientele and also as it hopes to sign a new deal to continue as @entity1 's official tire supplier			0
" the aim of introducing the new tire is to prevent any instances of the tread detaching itself from the structure , " the @entity11 statement continued			2
" however , the performance and wear characteristics of the new tire will not be significantly different , with the aim of keeping up the spectacle and retaining a strategic element to all the races			0
" in theory , the @entity71 does not interfere with decisions on tires			2
" we only step in on safety concerns. , " an @entity71 spokesman told @entity0 : " for us safety is paramount			0
" when they decide to bring a new tire , it is normally given to everybody			0
the tire has to be the same for everybody ... it is evaluated afterwards			0
" but with @entity53 facing an official investigation over its involvement in testing , the subject of tires has become an issue where everyone in @entity1 must now tread carefully .			0

@entity11 put plans to introduce new race tires at next month 's @entity31 @entity15 on hold
each of the 11 teams will instead try out development tires in the first practice session
@entity11 wants to change tires to stop delaminations
