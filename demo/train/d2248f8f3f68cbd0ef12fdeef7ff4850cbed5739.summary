@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on monday dismissed a pending appeal from @entity6 officials who were defending a state law limiting abortions performed with medicine instead of surgery			1
the law would have regulated the ability of doctors to prescribe a medication regime -- using @entity16 pills -- to terminate early pregnancies , and make it a crime to deviate from the federal government - approved dosage and time limits on the drugs			1
but many physicians -- backed by abortion rights supporters -- say they routinely induce medical abortions through a combination of drugs they determine is simpler , safer , and less expensive than the current federal protocols on the use of abortion drugs			0
the high court months ago had tentatively added this case to its docket , but put things on hold while it sought detailed answers from @entity40			1
those state justices again affirmed the law 's unconstitutionality , and now the nation 's highest court tossed out @entity6 's appeal " as improvidently granted			1
" this was the first of several restrictive abortion laws nationwide to get review by the @entity3 justices			2
a federal appeals court last week allowed a similar law from @entity54 to go into effect			0
but a coalition of abortion rights groups said monday they would ask the @entity3 @entity2 for an emergency injunction to block that law 's enforcement			2
the current case is @entity62 v. @entity63 ( 12 - 1094 )			0
what 's on the @entity2 docket			0

the @entity2 opts not to review a ruling *striking* down an @entity6 abortion law
the law would have regulated the ability of doctors to prescribe medicine to abort a pregnancy
the high court *reverses* an earlier *decision* to consider the appeal
