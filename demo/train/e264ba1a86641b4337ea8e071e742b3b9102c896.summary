-- former @entity2 champion @entity1 of @entity3 faces a life ban after kicking a referee flush in the face during his taekwondo bronze medal match in @entity8			1
@entity9 reacted in extraordinary fashion to being disqualified by @entity11			1
@entity9 , who took gold in @entity13 in 2000 , was winning 3 - 2 , with just over a minute left in the second round , when he fell to the mat after being hit by his opponent , @entity18 's @entity17			1
@entity9 lay down , awaiting medical attention , but was then disqualified by referee @entity11 of @entity20 for taking too much injury time			1
a furious @entity9 reacted by pushing a judge , then pushed and kicked @entity11 in the face			1
it left the @entity20 with blood pouring from his lip while @entity28 spat on the floor and was then escorted out of the arena			2
" we did n't expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur , " said @entity32 secretary general @entity31 - suk			0
" i am at a loss for words , " he told the @entity37			0
@entity9 ' coach , @entity40 , is also in hot water for his angry reaction and claiming the @entity43 had tried to fix the match			1
" this is an insult to the @entity2 vision , an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and , in my opinion , an insult to mankind , " @entity31 added			2
although the arena announcer said @entity9 and his coach were banned effective immediately , @entity31 said due process must be followed before officially banning the two			1
it was not the only controversial moment in the four - day taekwondo competition , which was marred by several protests against judging decisions			2
earlier saturday , @entity61 's double gold medalist @entity60 crashed out in the quarterfinals after initially being declared the winner			0
she was fighting @entity66 's @entity65 , who scored with a clear head kick -- worth two points -- in the final seconds of their bout			0
that would have put @entity72 ahead and into the semifinals , but the judges ruled @entity72 's kick was n't solid enough for points , and @entity60 was declared the winner 1 - 0			0
after @entity66 protested , the result was changed to put @entity72 in the semifinal			0
she lost that to jeers from the partisan @entity61 crowd , but later won a bronze medal match			1
it was the first time a match result has been overturned since taekwondo became an official @entity2 sport			2
