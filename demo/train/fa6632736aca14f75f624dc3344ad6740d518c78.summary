-- mention the words @entity2 , the masters and clubs and you 'd be forgiven for heading straight to the golf course			1
and if you 're feeling good and looking for all things sugar and spice then here are a few facts which might help your masters 2013 experience			2
@entity12 the man himself , " @entity13 " @entity13 , still looms large in @entity2 with his statue standing proud in the middle of @entity17			1
just a block away is the @entity19 where @entity13 would rehearse and fine tune his music before going abroad on world tours			1
born in @entity23 , @entity13 is still revered with fans from all over the world traveling to honor the singer who died at the age of 73 in december 2006			1
take a walk down a section of what used to be known as @entity31 and you 'll hit @entity33 -- a stretch of road where he used to shine shoes and earn a few dollars from passers by with a song and dance			0
and with the world 's attention on @entity2 , here 's an all singing and all dancing guide to the biggest show in town -- the masters			1
forward thinking its critics might accuse @entity2 of being stuck in the past , but the course has been one of the most technically progressive in the golfing world			1
this year , organizers have placed four sensors on each green which monitor the temperature , soil moisture and salinity -- all controlled by @entity60			2
it 's the latest in a long line of innovations from the tournament which was the first to introduce 72 - hole golf over four days			2
being first is nothing new to @entity2 though			1
it was the first tournament to be covered live on radio , the first to introduce the over / under par system and the first to introduce bleachers			0
tech savvy while @entity2 might have embraced technology , it 's not so keen on spectators , or " patrons " as they are known , using all the latest gadgets			1
the course specifically bans cell phones , beepers or any kind of electronic communication system with cameras only permitted on practice days			0
if you do take a cheeky snap you end up losing your ticket and politely being asked to leave			2
turkey shoot @entity2 's course is renowned as one of the most beautiful and picturesque on the planet -- but it was n't always that way			1
during the @entity92 , @entity2 was forced to close and was used to house over 200 cattle and 1,400 turkeys			1
so from 1943 until late 1944 , the course resembled something of a farm and it was n't until 1946 that august reopened , thanks in part to the help of 42 @entity103 prisoners of war from @entity105			2
keeping green with each hole being named after a plant or shrub , its no surprise that @entity2 takes the surrounding nature so seriously			1
last year 's cold snap meant that patrons missed out on seeing the beautiful azaleas which have adorned the course for so many years			1
there 's better news this year			2
along with the @entity121 the dogwood , peach and cherry trees are blooming			0
the great old oak tree , which was planted in the 1850s , continues to charm , while the 61 large @entity126 trees which line the path from the entrance to the clubhouse were planted at around the same time			0
eat like a champ the @entity131 has been going since 1952 when @entity132 first came up with the idea -- but while tradition has remained the food revolution has shown no signs of stopping			0
on the tuesday evening preceding the tournament , all the past masters winners dine together with the reigning champion selecting the menu			2
in 1998 , @entity142 and friends feasted on cheeseburgers , chicken sandwiches , @entity147 fries and milkshakes			0
others such as @entity150 went for @entity152 and wild boar in 2004 , while @entity154 @entity153 went for @entity155 , mashed potatoes and turnips in 1989			0
royalty it 's not just the players that get to eat like kings , the patrons are well fed too and the prices are phenomenally low			2
the world famous @entity166 sandwiches will set you back just $ 1.50 while the @entity169 , which has won rave reviews , is also available at the same price			0
you can pick up a beer for $ 3 while an imported lager will set you back $ 4			0
antipodean angst do n't mention @entity2 to an @entity175 -- it has proved something of a graveyard for the nation 's golfers -- and the country is still getting over the pain and torment of @entity184 's capitulation , which came after squandering a six - shot lead to @entity186 in 1996			1
" @entity184 " had already lost out in 1987 after losing to @entity187 in a playoff			0
but @entity184 is not the only @entity175 to suffer at @entity2			1
back in 1950 , @entity189 , who hailed from @entity190 , had his three - shot lead wiped out in the final round as he slumped to second and ended his career without a @entity195 victory			0
@entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 all missed out on the final day , while @entity199 and @entity200 were forced to settle for second in 2011			0
spooked @entity175 's golfers are n't the only ones to have been left @entity2 spooked in @entity2			1
the town has a whole host of ghost stories , while the famous " @entity207 " still stands proudly on @entity17			1
the pillar , which used to support the market back in the 1830s , has been at the center of folklore since the story of how a traveling preacher cursed the town			0
the preacher was unhappy with the abuse he received and is supposed to have said : " a great storm will tear this market asunder and only one pillar will be left standing ! " on february 8 1878 , a tornado hit the city , killing several people , destroying the market and leaving just the pillar intact			0
it remains a tourist attraction , but only the brave actually touch it			0
first ladies " it 's a @entity230 once sang , but for how much longer ? for the first time ever , you might see two women wearing the iconic @entity234 at @entity2 after the club opened its exclusive membership to women last august			1
for the first time in its history , women were invited to join with former @entity241 secretary of state @entity240 and @entity23 businesswoman @entity242 both now members			0
@entity244 played a practice round with three - times @entity246 champion @entity246 last sunday before heading to the clubhouse which had been closed to women since it opened in 1932 .			0

the masters is held in @entity2 , @entity250 , every year
