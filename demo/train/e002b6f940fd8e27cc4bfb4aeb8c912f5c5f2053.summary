a new study finds that 28 % of parents following the @entity3 - recommended schedule for childhood vaccinations think it would be safer to delay the shots until children are older			1
the study , published monday in the journal @entity9 , confirms that about 2 % of parents living in the @entity11 are refusing all vaccines for their children , and more than one in 10 alter the @entity3 - recommended vaccination schedule by delaying or refusing certain vaccines			1
among parents following an alternative vaccine schedule , 30 % actually began with the regular schedule , but then changed their minds			2
" i was surprised by the malleability of people 's attitudes " said dr. @entity21 , one of the study authors			0
" in my own clinical practice , i have been more used to parents pretty firmly decided one way or the other what they wanted to do			2
" parents are refusing certain vaccines at higher rates than others , the study finds			1
@entity34 and the seasonal flu vaccine topped the rejection list			0
among vaccines delayed until a child grows older , the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine , a two - stage vaccine administered at 12 months and then again at age 4 , topped the list			1
pediatricians generally stay sensitive to parents ' concerns , accommodating alternative vaccine schedules when requested			2
" there is a small group of pediatricians , and i think it 's growing slowly , that tell patients , ' if you come into our practice , we are immunizing your children according to the @entity3 's and the @entity9 standard schedule , ' " said dr. @entity47 , who chairs the department of preventive medicine at @entity50			0
" [ they say ] ' anything less than that is not appropriate for your child			0
if you 're uncomfortable with that , @entity64 bless you , here are the names of some other pediatricians in town who will likely take care of your children			0
' " @entity47 said the main problem , as he sees it , is that parents have no knowledge of the diseases their children are being inoculated against			1
the diseases have sort of faded from the public consciousness , but can spring back if enough of the population goes unvaccinated			0
this year has seen more cases of measles than any year since 1996			1
as of august , there have been 198 confirmed cases in the @entity11 , according to the @entity3 , with the vast majority among the unvaccinated			1
usually the transmission comes from traveling abroad			0
not only do unvaccinated children run the risk of becoming ill or worse , but they also endanger others who do n't have the option to vaccinate			1
for example , children under 12 months old and those with certain medical conditions like @entity94 do n't receive the @entity97 vaccine			0
instead they rely on a " herd effect , " unprotected themselves , but living among a population where disease ca n't find a foothold			0
in @entity104 , the measles outbreak has been far worse than in the @entity11 , with thousands of confirmed cases correlating with a decline in vaccination rates sparked by @entity109 's 1998 fraudulent study alleging a connection between the @entity97 vaccine and autism			1
globally , measles still is a leading cause of death among children , killing an estimated 450 people every day , according to the @entity118			1
but many parents fear the vaccines carry a more immediate risk and do damage in ways perhaps not yet documented by medical researchers			2
what public health officials do know is that about one in six children will experience a fever and one in 3,000 will have a seizure after receiving the @entity97 vaccine , according to the @entity129 , but severe side effects are extremely rare , and there is no evidence of a link to autism			0
parents noticing any reaction in their child after vaccination should report the incident using the @entity140			0
regarding her research into parents ' " malleable " attitudes on vaccines , @entity141 said figuring out what is swaying parents away from the recommended schedule is important , and something her research can not yet answer .			2
