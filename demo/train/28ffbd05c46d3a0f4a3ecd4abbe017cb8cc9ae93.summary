-- from dusk until dawn , 12 - year - old @entity1 toils at his uncle 's blacksmith shop in @entity6			1
while other kids his age are in school , he 's swinging a heavy sledgehammer and doing physically exhausting work that he knows is not meant for a boy			1
but he does n't have much choice			0
it has been that way since he was 7 , when his father got sick			0
" @entity1 went to get the doctor , but the doctor did n't come because they could n't afford the doctor 's services			2
later that night , his father died , " filmmaker @entity21 explained recently on @entity0 's " @entity22			2
" " after that , @entity1 and his two brothers were forced by economic difficulties to work			0
" @entity1 is one of four young @entity27 featured in the half - hour documentary " unnoticed : children of @entity6 , " which @entity21 co-directed and produced along with @entity32 @entity31			1
@entity21 said there are 50,000 to 60,000 kids working in @entity6			2
" they all share a very similar story , " he told @entity0 's @entity35			2
" usually either their father died or the father is disabled , mom ca n't work , so these kids are forced into child labor			1
" @entity43 has estimated that at least 30 % of @entity27 children age 5 - 14 are working in some form			1
but the issue goes far beyond @entity27 's borders : @entity43 says that worldwide , approximately 158 million children between 5 and 14 , one of every six children in that age group , are engaged in child labor			1
" most of these children are working to help their families meet their basic needs ; not all of them , " said @entity53 , an associate professor of economics at @entity55 who advises many @entity57 and international organizations on child labor issues			1
" i think it 's easy to see instances of child abuse and child neglect and assume they 're pervasive and they characterize all of those working children			1
but i think the reality of the situation is that ... most of those working children are doing so to help meet family needs			2
" while it varies by country , @entity75 said the world 's most common child labor -- by far -- is agricultural			1
forget about the manufacturing " sweatshops " that tend to dominate the headlines			0
often , child labor is simply a kid working on the family farm			1
" a lot of people say that 's character - building , that 's good stuff for them to be doing , " @entity75 said			1
" but the risks associated with agriculture are actually a lot more extreme than a lot of shopkeeping - type tasks that you can imagine : children involved in toxic chemicals , children exposed to pests , children operating machinery that 's too large for them , is n't designed to be done by them			1
all are serious risks that unfortunately a lot of children face			2
" of course , the risk of physical harm is just one of many consequences that come with child labor , whether it 's on a farm , in a factory or on a street			1
the most serious might be the effect it has on society as a whole			0
if children are spending most of their time working , they 'll never be able to attend school and get the education they need to find a better - paying job one day			1
often , they will grow up illiterate and poor and pass on the same problems to their own children			2
" child labor perpetuates poverty , " said @entity125 , a 2011 @entity126			1
" it compromises the future of any country because it condemns its most vulnerable citizens			0
" ' a better future ' in some countries , children are so desperately poor that they spend their days at trash dumps , scavenging for things to sell and sometimes eat			2
eleven years ago , @entity125 was shocked to see about 200 children , some as young as 3 , working at a trash dump in @entity140 , @entity141			2
" i saw children collect green sausages , a bag of potato chip crumbs , a bag of noodles with cream , and recovered leftover yogurt next to a diaper , " said @entity125 , a @entity142 who , at the time , was visiting the country for work			2
" the children began to gently clean the food -- wiping each little noodle , each potato and peeling the sausage skin so methodically and accurately			2
it was as if they had done this same activity many times			0
" @entity125 soon learned that many children in @entity140 dropped out of school to spend their lives as " ragpickers			0
" " at that moment in time , my son was the same age as many of them , " she said			0
" so that struck me as horrific			0
" the scene inspired her to start a nonprofit called @entity173 , which stands for @entity175 y @entity174 ( @entity176 and @entity177 )			0
the organization provides children with free education and extracurricular programs so they do n't have to work			0
today , more than 200 boys and girls in @entity140 benefit from @entity173			0
" we give them an incentive to have a better future , a different future , " she said			0
one of the children featured in @entity21 's documentary is a ragpicker			1
@entity191 , a 13 - year - old @entity27 girl , scavenges the trash dumps of @entity6 's richest neighborhoods			1
" she usually picks ( up ) paper and plastic , but if she finds metal , she picks it up , too , and sells it , " @entity21 told @entity0 's @entity194			0
" they use the paper and plastic for firewood			0
" @entity191 's father was killed in a bomb explosion four years ago , and her mother is mentally ill , according to the documentary			1
so she and her 8 - year - old brother have had to help support themselves			0
" if you 're there in @entity27 just walking around , you see thousands and thousands of kids working in the street , " @entity21 said			1
" you see people passing by , and no one pays attention			0
" the issue has special significance to the young @entity27 filmmaker , now a student at @entity221 in @entity222 , @entity223			1
born in 1991 during the early stages of the @entity27 civil war , he was once a child laborer			1
" we weaved rugs eight hours a day			0
... my friends and classmates every day played soccer ( outside the factory ) , " he said			0
" i could hear them every day shouting , and so the whole time i was making rugs , my mind was outside with them			0
" i was fortunate to move to the @entity57 where i received an education			0
now i came back to @entity27 to tell the stories of kids who share a very similar story with me			1
" his co-director hopes the film will have a positive impact on @entity27 's future			1
" sixty - eight percent of the @entity27 population right now is under the age of 25 , " @entity31 said			1
" so this is a golden opportunity to really have advancement in this country , to have @entity27 move forward			2
" by really investing in this population , by showing people what 's going on ... i think we can really make a difference			0
" for more information about " unnoticed : children of @entity6 , " e-mail the filmmakers at @entity259			0
@entity0 's @entity261 contributed to this report .			0

a new documentary examines the child labor problem in @entity27 's *capital*
there are nearly 60,000 child workers there , according to the film 's co-director
@entity43 : worldwide , child labor affects one of every six children age 5 - 14
