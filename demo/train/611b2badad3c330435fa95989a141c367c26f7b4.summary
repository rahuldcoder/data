-- rather than getting ready to attract more tourists in its high season , @entity1 is headed toward the polls again on june 17			1
in the midst of domestic political uncertainty , more and more outside observers agree that " @entity9 " -- the prospect of @entity1 leaving the euro -- has become inevitable			1
yet to read the may 6 election results or the first polls for the june election as evidence of @entity1 opposition to the euro -- or even to public and private sector reform -- is both simplistic and misguided			1
given the choice , @entity1 would pick @entity19 over their own politicians			1
two weeks ago , the electorate did not reject the @entity23 or the single currency			2
rather , they rejected the political duopoly that has monopolized power in @entity28 since the last @entity29 collapsed in 1974			0
the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) and @entity31 ( @entity31 ) -- the so - called " establishment " supportive of the bailout -- are the same parties that built an unviable state with a bloated public payroll and enough red tape to wrap the @entity37			0
for all the good @entity38 did in late 2009 by coming clean about the lies of past administrations , it was his father who helped build this woefully inefficient and ultimately insolvent system			0
@entity38 the @entity44 changed tack only when credit markets woke up to the fact that @entity1 credit was not exactly of @entity50 quality ( surprise ! ) now his former @entity53 roommate , @entity52 , promises to " save @entity1			1
" but less than a year ago @entity52 was busy sowing distrust throughout @entity19 by refusing to promise that his party would honor existing commitments			1
while the new @entity30 leader @entity57 has acted more responsibly , he is also part of the same tainted elite			0
a last - ditch effort by the president to form a technocratic , unity government failed last week			0
of course , technocracy has been tried in @entity1 before			1
but the reason the last supposedly technocratic administration of @entity66 had a hard time passing meaningful reform was because it included @entity30 and @entity31 ministers , who carried on their internecine feud with an eye to the polls			0
@entity66 's mistake was not to demand a fully technocratic administration like @entity75 's in @entity76			2
the bottom line is that the @entity31 - @entity30 duopoly has now lost its legitimacy			0
the fragmentation of the @entity1 political scene was a predictable consequence of an economic depression voters rightly blamed on the political establishment			1
the good news is that the appeal of the far - right @entity87 seems to have peaked			0
the bad news is that the main beneficiary of public disillusionment is @entity91 , leader of the intransigent hard - left @entity92 , who claims to " listen to the people " while rejecting the kind of unity government that more than 70 % of @entity1 said they wanted			1
@entity91 acts as if he commanded a majority , but he achieved less than 17 % support on may 6 -- and for all the ink spilled about him he will not get a majority in june			0
domestically , his party offers nothing more than a return to the old and miserably tested ways of hiring more public servants and reversing useful reform			0
worse , his populist platform is openly contradictory on the euro : how can he seriously argue he wants to honor @entity1 ' hopes to remain in the single currency while simultaneously promising to burn all existing agreements with @entity19 ? the game of chicken he is playing with @entity115 and @entity116 is reckless because the costs of @entity9 would be devastating for @entity1			1
for all his talk of " listening to the @entity1 " , @entity91 neglects to mention leaving the euro would require even more draconian austerity because @entity1 would have to close its primary budget deficit overnight			1
there would be little tradable sector to rely on			0
so @entity91 's party would then have to seize deposits like the @entity127 government did in late 2001			2
exit from the euro would then punish middle class depositors while rewarding those @entity1 with their money in @entity132			1
and devaluation - induced competitiveness would be ephemeral as inflation ravaged a restored drachma			0
in short , @entity92 offers a blast from the past : failed strategies to keep hiring public workers and to isolate itself internationally			0
@entity1 know full well that this is the past from which they escaped through membership in the @entity23 , which is why the polls suggest that between 75 - 82 % of them want to remain in the single currency			1
so what @entity1 urgently needs is a @entity147 , pro-reform alliance , without too much pasok and @entity31 baggage , to take on @entity91 's shallow dream			1
regardless of whether chancellor @entity151 suggested it or not , it may be time to revive the idea of a euro referendum			0
the electorate would then be able to make clear that they want to keep the benefits of @entity23 integration			0
from the perspective of @entity116 and @entity115 , maddening though @entity28 may be , there is no alternative but to double down on @entity1 -- because a @entity1 exit would have huge ripple effects through all the @entity165 economies ( and their banking systems )			1
more importantly , structural reform is still worth pursuing -- opening up the professions , reforming the public sector , and liberalizing an economy that only benefits insiders are laudable goals			2
there is no reason why the state should be paying salaries for people who have not shown up to work in decades or be hostage to a taxi union keen on maintaining their monopoly at the expense of tourism , which comprises almost the whole @entity1 export sector			2
but the @entity1 need stronger incentives to endure the pain of fiscal consolidation			2
in the coming days , the new @entity194 president 's @entity192 's " growth compact " and the calm credibility of @entity76 's @entity75 may help change the outlook for @entity19 reform and consolidation			1
these leaders are tacit supporters of the idea of a " quid pro quo " for reforming governments			0
humiliated in her own regional elections last weekend , @entity50 's @entity151 now has little option but to heed them			2
starting with the informal summit this week , it is time for the next step down the long and winding road to joint and several liability of eurozone debt .			2
