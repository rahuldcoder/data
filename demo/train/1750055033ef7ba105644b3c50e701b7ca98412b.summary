-- watching the movie " @entity3 " on saturday , rep. @entity1 was perplexed during the climactic scene			1
two of his predecessors from nearly 150 years ago , lawmakers representing the state of @entity7 in 1865 , are seen voting against the constitutional amendment to end slavery			1
@entity1 asked the @entity11 for the records , and sure enough , all four representatives from @entity7 voted yes on the 13th amendment			1
but in the film , we see the fictional lawmakers @entity18 and @entity20 of @entity7 each vote " @entity22			1
" " i could not believe my own eyes and ears , " @entity1 said			1
in a letter of protest to director @entity27 , he said that although he thinks overall the film is tremendous and compelling , " placing the @entity7 on the wrong side of the historic and divisive fight over slavery is a distortion of easily verifiable facts			1
" screenwriter @entity34 conceded the discrepancy but defended the film			2
" none of the key moments of that story -- the overarching story our film tells -- are altered , " he said in a statement thursday			1
he explained that the alterations were made to serve the narrative that the outcome of the vote was in doubt until the very end			0
" i hope nobody is shocked to learn that i also made up dialogue and imagined encounters and invented characters , " he added			0
" i 'm sorry if anyone in @entity7 felt insulted by these 15 seconds of the movie , " @entity34 said , but " this is a dramatic film and not an attack on their home state			1
" still , @entity1 said friday that he hoped the movie would be changed before it is released on dvd on february 26			1
" the four members of @entity7 's delegation ... deserved a better legacy than the screenplay portrayed , " he said			2
historian @entity65 , a researcher with the papers of @entity67 , supported the congressman 's objection			0
" it seems like such an unnecessary error , " he said			0
nevertheless , he added , " it should n't overshadow the fact that overall , this is a very strong and accurate portrayal of what actually happened			0
" going through the movie script vote by vote , @entity0 found that the important details are correct			2
by the narrowest of margins , after a breathless and unpredictable roll call , the amendment passes , with most @entity82 in favor but many @entity84 opposed			0
six of the lawmakers in the film actually existed and cast real votes , while the rest are apparently fictitious			2
no other vote discrepancies were found in the scene			0
@entity93 historian @entity92 said the voting in the film is not the only discrepancy , but for dramatic effect , some poetic license is fine in such a movie			1
" it is historical fiction -- a noble genre going back to @entity103 and well before -- not history , " he said			0
indeed , the movie makes no claims to be a documentary , but is rather a historical film			2
in the style of a political thriller , it depicts president @entity67 's efforts to get a ban on slavery passed in @entity115 , using a combination of persuasion , inspiration , horse - trading and arm - twisting			0
the film has been nominated for 12 @entity122 and has been a success both with the critics and at the box office			0
@entity126 , the distributor , and representatives for @entity27 did not reply to inquiries from @entity0 on wednesday			1
" ' @entity3 ' is an exceptionally good @entity132 historical film , " he said , " so i think we have to have a certain amount of tolerance for a certain amount of error			0
" @entity0 's @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
