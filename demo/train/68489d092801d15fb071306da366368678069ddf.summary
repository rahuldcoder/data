budget cuts ground @entity35 , @entity36 " we must implement a tiered readiness concept where only the units preparing to deploy in support of major operations like @entity42 are fully mission capable			1
units will stand down on a rotating basis so our limited resources can be focused on fulfilling critical missions , " @entity16 said			2
" the current situation means we 're accepting the risk that combat air power may not be ready to respond immediately to new contingencies as they occur , " he said			0

the @entity52 had warned the cuts could threaten readiness			1
it is also expected to furlough civilian employees and cut contracts to meet the budget target			0
separately , the @entity65 on tuesday announced it was canceling all the air shows its @entity67 had scheduled for the rest of the year			1
the @entity65 action follows the @entity2 's april 1 announcement that its @entity36 team would not perform again this year			1

others were grounded on tuesday			0
the action will also impact certain @entity80 and @entity82 @entity81 and f - 16 squadrons			0
" we 're entering uncharted territory in terms of how we 've had to take this year 's cuts and make adjustments to mitigate the most serious impacts , " @entity16 said			0
" remaining as mission - ready as possible for combatant commanders is our priority , and we 're prioritizing spending to ensure this imperative is met			0
" units that stop flying will shift their emphasis to ground training			2
they will use flight simulators to the extent possible within existing contracts , and conduct academic training to maintain basic skills and knowledge of their aircraft			0
