@entity1 , @entity0 -- those who say no man is an island never met @entity6			1
the 61 - year - old retired construction supervisor lives in @entity1 , @entity0 , a farming community so small that when asked how to find the town , locals respond , " do n't blink			1
" @entity12 ' trailer in @entity1 is about seven miles from the @entity13			1
historic flooding across the region brought " the @entity16 " much closer to him			0
the two - room trailer is more than 5 feet off the ground , but the river 's invasion reaches @entity6 ' door and , at its height , threatened to evict him			1
" there 's the possibility the trailer could shift , could turn			1
could flip over , " @entity6 said , standing on the trailer 's small porch			1
" then again , i am not worried about that because i will get out			0
" the @entity13 's flooding has already forced hundreds to flee small towns like @entity1 to cities like @entity33			1
and meteorologists say the heavy rainfall across the @entity36 could mean weeks more of high water			0
whatever comes , @entity6 said he will not be moved			1
" i 'd say for the average person who grew up in towns , you 'd be in a dangerous situation , " he said			0
" i 'd say a person who learned to live off the land and to survive , it 's not a big thing			2
" the one acre of land @entity6 retired to is no longer recognizable to him			1
@entity48 of pecan trees now stand half - covered in water			0
homes abandoned by neighbors sit in several feet of dank and stinking water			0
to get to dry ground , @entity6 paddles a small boat about 50 yards to @entity56			2
once on shore , he then walks the half - mile to town each day for a pack of cigarettes and a little conversation			0
the homes around @entity6 ' trailer sit empty , but as he waits out the flood , he is hardly alone			1
since the waters began to rise , @entity6 said , all manner of animals have swum by the trailer , looking for higher ground			1
the snakes , he shoots			0
" it 's illegal to kill snakes in @entity0 , " he said with a serious look before breaking into a wide smile			1
" unless it 's for your own protection			0
" the nine - shot revolver with a long barrel that @entity6 keeps close also works to ward off other predators			1
empty homes in the rural area could make for an inviting target for looters , he said			0
but his and his neighbors ' homes are safe , @entity6 said , while he patrols his small " island			2
" to make his point , @entity6 suddenly shoots the pistol three times in sudden succession into the invading waters			2
" i am a crazy old man , " he said with a laugh , " and i will shoot the hell out of you , and i am serious about that			0
" as he waits for the waters to retreat , @entity6 ' family checks in with him regularly by cell phone			2
his two sons and their families fret about his decision to ride out the flood			0
but @entity6 said he never considered leaving			2
so stubborn he married and divorced the same woman three times before they finally called it quits			0
too stubborn " to run for the hills over some water			0
" " rescue all them poor people and do n't worry about this 61 - year - old man , " he said			2
" do n't waste no 911 on me			0
" but with the water slowly receding , it appears that @entity6 will be spared from the flood 's wet grasp			1
still , it could be another week , he predicted , before @entity1 begins to dry out			2
asked what he will do while the floodwaters retreat , @entity6 replied with a ready joke			0
" i got to sell this here land , " he said , " while it 's still waterfront property ! " @entity2 's @entity125 contributed to this report .			1

@entity6 , 61 , lives in @entity1 , @entity0
the flooded @entity13 has reached the door of his two - room trailer
armed with his revolver , he is *refusing* to evacuate
" i got to sell this here land while it 's still waterfront property , " he jokes
