-- a year after leaving @entity1 , and i had almost forgotten how it feels to be under pressure and terrified all the time			1
how so easily you can become one of the nameless victims , considered lucky if you were even counted among the dead			1
but a year after fleeing from the civil war , i have come back -- to a place dominated by fear and chaos , one governed by the force of arms and of bombs			1
why did i choose to come back to all this ? the main reason is professional -- i am now working for @entity18			1
but there is another reason -- a desire to see the country i left 12 months ago , and to see the situation and devastation through my own eyes , not through the filter of the media			1
like most of my @entity1 colleagues , i was n't an aid worker before the conflict			1
this is a new field of work for many of us , but in it i feel that i have a responsibility to those @entity1 who are trapped inside this never - ending conflict			1
each time i interview a child or a mother , i have a responsibility to share their story and ensure the world does not forget them			1
before i came back , i thought that perhaps people would n't want to speak to me -- that they would be scared to share their experiences			1
but actually , everyone was just relieved that there were people outside @entity1 who still cared			1
on my first day i was on the border , and stretched out before me i could see camps filled with tents and thousands of displaced people			2
i can not imagine how these families are coping in these conditions , families like mine who are now collecting water in a jerry can and relying on food rations			2
and then i started to notice other things , smaller details that show how much life in @entity1 has changed			1
for example , i noticed that many of the cars were driving around without license plates			2
why ? well i guess they do n't need to -- who will fine drivers for their defiance ? anyway , now even the smallest problems are solved by weapons , and people feel they need bigger weapons and stronger connections to stay alive			2
another change -- all of the men i saw had long beards			2
i was surprised to see even local people had them			2
i asked the people i am traveling with if this was common in this area before the war , and they tell me that it was not			2
that this is " conflict fashion			2
" fashion ? since when was conflict ever associated with fashion ? i have seen destroyed buildings and war zones on tv and in the news , but returning here was the first time i had seen such destruction in real life			1
at first you ca n't believe your eyes , and you have to remind yourself that you are not watching an apocalyptic movie , but real life			1
it eventually dawns on you that this is not a film set , that there is life and there are families living in the remnants of these half - destroyed buildings			1
i wonder how these people do it			0
how do people who grew up like me adapt to a situation where virtually everything has been taken away ? the answer is that when there is nowhere left to run , you simply have no choice but to find a way to survive			0
there are airstrikes so people create their own local warning siren			0
there is no electricity , so people make candles and rig up their own power systems using batteries			0
but i am shaken out of my thoughts by the shouts of a friend who is asking everyone to turn off the lights			0
it 's evening , and the locals have heard that there may be an attack on the village we are in			0
we all move quickly to turn everything off and sit to listen to the reports on the radio			0
there is mention of a village just a couple of miles from us			0
my friend tells me this village might be attacked and we should stay on the floor			0
then i hear the name of the village we are in			0
i look at the faces of my friends ; pale , ironically smiling , feigned bravado			0
none of us say a word , and i swear i can hear our hearts beating			0
we all know tonight it could be us that are the next nameless victims			0
i spend most of the night in a state of paralyzed fear , until finally , at some point , we all fall asleep			0
the next day people wake as if nothing had happened			0
that is what life in @entity1 is like now -- you lived , you are lucky			1
now you just have to get on with your day and hope that you will be so fortunate again .			0
