-- consumers who bought " @entity5 " dolls and @entity4 dog toys were misled into believing that a portion of their purchases would go to charity , according to a lawsuit filed this week			1
the " @entity5 " doll cost $ 29.99 before @entity11 halted its production			0
the @entity14 attorney general 's office filed a lawsuit thursday against @entity11 and its owner , @entity16 , seeking $ 10,000 in penalties for each violation under the state 's @entity19			1
but @entity16 denies the allegations , saying he has been trying to resolve the disputes and compensate charitable organizations			1
the @entity25 - based entrepreneur claims he has been working with the attorney general 's office for more than one year to settle the issue			1
the suit also asks that @entity16 stop running the web site , @entity30 , his short - lived vehicle for selling dolls that critics said were modeled after slain @entity14 toddler @entity34			1
@entity16 says the doll was not meant to be @entity5 , but rather a tribute to her memory			2
the dispute began with the attorney general 's investigation into complaints about dog chew toys in the likeness of suspended @entity46 star @entity4 , who is serving a federal prison sentence for his role in a dogfighting operation			1
consumers said they ordered and paid for merchandise from the company but did not receive the items , according to the lawsuit			0
the lawsuit also claims that @entity11 told consumers that a portion of the proceeds would go to local animal shelters , another promise @entity16 allegedly never made good on			1
" @entity61 began cooperating with the attorney general and made attempts to either make delivery on consumer orders for the @entity66 or to provide refunds			1
however , numerous consumer complaints remain unresolved , " the complaint alleges			0
but @entity16 claims the scope of the damage is less extensive			2
of 200 complaints that he says the attorney general 's office received , all but 10 were resolved			1
" those people purchased on @entity75 , so the only way i had to get in touch was going though e-mail			0
if they do n't respond , then i ca n't help them , " he said in a telephone interview friday			0
@entity16 also insists that his company made donations to animal shelters in forms of merchandise , including @entity4 chew toys , t - shirts and hats			2
" they 'd rather have $ 100 in toys because they can sell them or auction them off , " he said			0
" we said they could have either and every time they said they wanted the toys			0
" the suit also addresses @entity16 's promotion of the @entity102 and other members of the @entity104 , including @entity105 and @entity106			1
the dolls set off a firestorm of controversy with its launch in january , drawing allegations that @entity11 was attempting to profit off the death of @entity34 , whose mother is facing trial for her murder			0
members of the public , media pundits and the @entity120 called for production of the dolls to be halted			0
one month later , @entity11 pulled the plug on the @entity123 , citing high manufacturing costs and tepid consumer response			0
the company had fulfilled just five orders and provided refunds for 20 , according to @entity16			2
the lawsuit alleges that the product 's web site , @entity30 , falsely claimed that " 100 % of the profits " from the @entity104 would go to charity , accusing @entity16 of fabricating a donation receipt and posting it on the site so visitors could view " the first donation " made to charity			1
the receipt -- a purported screen grab from the @entity142 's web site -- shows an " online credit card donation confirmation " for $ 5,000 in the name of @entity11 , according to the lawsuit			1
@entity16 says he never posted any such image on the site			2
the alleged receipt is attached as an exhibit to the lawsuit , along with another purported receipt in @entity16 's name that the attorney general 's office says is the only existing @entity142 donation associated with @entity16 or @entity11			1
see exhibits attached to the lawsuit " @entity157 confirmed that their records showed that a donation was made by @entity16 on march 12 , 2009 at [ 5:28 p.m. ] in the amount of $ 10 , " the lawsuit states			1
" @entity157 confirmed that they had no record of a donation from @entity11 in any amount or any additional donation from @entity16			2
" @entity16 insists that the receipt for $ 5,000 is not real -- and says his company had nothing to do with it			2
" they 're saying this was posted on our web site and clearly it was not			0
that is clearly something that someone made and sent to them and they 're jumping the gun , " he said			0
furthermore , he does not deny making a $ 10 donation to @entity142 out of his own pocket			0
" we had nothing left to give to charity apart from what i give every year , which is $ 10 , " he said			0
" if giving $ 10 every year to charity is a crime , then i 'm guilty			0
