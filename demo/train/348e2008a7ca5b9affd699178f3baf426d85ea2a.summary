-- before he was pope @entity2 , before he earned the nickname " @entity4 " as the enforcer of church doctrine , he was @entity2 -- the son of @entity7 and police officer @entity2 , learning about life and @entity10 in @entity11 between two world wars			1
according to @entity14 doctrine , @entity2 is not only the church 's leader but @entity10 's representative on earth and infallible			1
he is also a man -- one who savors his meat and potatoes , an accomplished pianist who loves @entity22 , and a teacher who for years commanded university classes			0
his humanity became apparent monday , when the @entity26 announced he 'd resign at month 's end " because of advanced age , " becoming the first pope in nearly 600 years to do so			0
after his birth on april 16 , 1927 , in @entity31 am @entity32 , in southeastern @entity11 near the @entity34 border , @entity2 's early years were defined by his country and the turbulent times , as well as his faith			1
@entity37 rose to power during @entity2 's adolescent years in @entity39 , in the heavily @entity14 region of @entity41			1
when he was 14 , school officials followed @entity45 officials ' orders and enrolled him and the rest of his class in the @entity49 movement -- against his will , @entity2 wrote in his memoir			1
he left the organization shortly thereafter , because he was studying for the priesthood			0
but in 1943 , @entity2 was brought back into the @entity45 fold upon being drafted into the @entity11 army			1
for the next two years , @entity2 served his country as part of an anti-aircraft unit			2
but in the waning days of @entity59 , he deserted -- and was taken prisoner by the @entity61			0
according to @entity0 senior @entity26 analyst @entity62 , @entity2 's family was strongly , if quietly , anti-nazi and his father took a series of less significant jobs to steer clear from what was happening under @entity37			2
in june 1945 , @entity2 was released from a pow camp			2
hitching a ride on a milk truck , he headed home			0
opinion : why pope will be remembered for generations the soldier became a scholar , studying philosophy and theology at the @entity80 and another school in @entity82 between 1946 and 1951			2
two years later , he earned a doctorate in theology , after submitting a thesis titled , " @entity86 in @entity88 's @entity87			0
" eventually , he became a professor -- teaching dogma and fundamental theology at four @entity11 universities			1
in 1969 , for instance , he was appointed vice president and professor of theology at the @entity97 in @entity11			1
" books are his best friends , " @entity62 said			0
all the while , he grew more ingrained in the @entity14 and its hierarchy			2
in 1962 , 11 years after his ordination as a priest , the then - 35 - year - old was a consultant during @entity26 to cardinal @entity106 , a reformer who was archbishop of @entity107 , @entity11			2
as a young priest , @entity2 was on the progressive side of theological debates			2
but he began to shift right after student revolutions of 1968 , according to @entity62 , also a correspondent with the @entity113			0
in fact , it was @entity2 's conservative defense of strict doctrines that defined him in many people 's eyes -- until he became pope			1
a defender of church doctrine and a ' simple , humble worker ' in the late 1970s and 1980s , @entity2 shot up the church 's ranks			1
in spring 1977 , he was named archbishop of @entity127 and @entity82			0
a few months later , pope @entity128 appointed him cardinal			0
one of his most significant steps up came in 1981 when he took over as head of the @entity131 , the @entity132 office that oversees " the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the @entity14 world , " according to the @entity26			1
@entity2 became known as " @entity4 " stemming from his efforts to crack down on the liberation theology movement , religious pluralism , challenges to traditional teachings on issues such as homosexuality , and calls to ordain women as priests			1
liberation theology combined @entity148 theology with political activism on issues like human rights and social justice			0
while partially compatible with catholic social teachings , it was rejected by the @entity26 , which objected to the mixing of church theology with @entity158 ideas such as class struggle			0
" it ( was ) his job to police the doctrinal boundaries of the @entity14 , and inevitably when you do that , there are going to be hurt feelings by people who find themselves on the wrong side of those lines , " said @entity62 , the author of " @entity2 : the @entity26 's @entity170			1
" over subsequent years , he made news when , for instance , he labeled homosexuality " an intrinsic moral evil " and called the @entity174 and its communist satellite nations " a shame of our time			0
" in the 1990s , @entity2 openly challenged a fellow @entity11 cardinal who had encouraged divorced and civilly remarried @entity14 to return to the sacraments			1
@entity2 also argued @entity182 did not belong in @entity183 and issued a document saying that @entity185 was the only true religion -- questioning the validity of other religions , even @entity148 ones , even as his pope @entity190 was trying to reach out to other faiths			1
although objections came from some of his fellow cardinals , the pope did not restrain @entity2 , in part because their friendship went back four decades , to the time when the two were young priests at the @entity26 meetings in @entity201			1
the @entity190 's resignation explained that bond persevered until @entity190 's death in 2005 , by which time @entity2 was dean of the @entity205 -- the high - level group that advises the pope and , when called upon , picks a new pontiff			1
in april 2005 , they picked him , then 78 years old			0
now called @entity2 , his reputation was seen as more subdued than his predecessor			1
he traveled extensively , if not at @entity190 's pace			0
his words carried special weight , as in 2006 , when he quoted from 14th - century byzantine emperor @entity215 saying the @entity216 had only brought into the world " things only evil and inhuman			0
" the remarks set off protests by @entity221 worldwide , and @entity2 apologized for any offense taken by @entity221			2
for some , the defining element of his papacy was the sex abuse scandal , with the church being accused of not doing enough to deal with reports of abuse by priests over decades , and on multiple continents			0
two years after acknowledging " shame " over the " evils " of abuse , @entity2 issued a statement in 2010 saying the church had not been vigilant or fast enough in responding to the problem -- one of the most forthright admissions to date , though it still did not placate some who criticized then - @entity2 for not cracking down sufficiently			2
such missives demonstrated his power , in the church and on the world stage			0
but for all the headlines he generated , @entity2 -- as he did in his first blessing after being elected pope -- insisted he was merely " a simple , humble worker in @entity10 's vineyard			2
" " i am consoled by the fact that the @entity247 knows how to work and how to act , even with insufficient tools , " he said then , " and i especially trust in your prayers			0

the son of a police officer , @entity2 was born in southeastern @entity11 in 1927
he was briefly in the @entity49 and @entity45 army , though he eventually deserted
he was a theology professor who also rose up the @entity14 ranks
some called him " @entity4 " for his strict enforcement of doctrine before becoming pope
