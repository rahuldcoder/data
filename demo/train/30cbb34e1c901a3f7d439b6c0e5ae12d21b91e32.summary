-- one of the unintended consequences of the @entity3 revolutions has become evident in @entity4 , where a surge in the number of refugees from @entity8 has created new tensions in a country with no shortage of practical and ethical dilemmas			1
in the face of the new challenge , a number of @entity4 politicians have sunk to the occasion , exploiting raw emotions and fueling a display of violence that should shame @entity4			1
to be sure , @entity4 is not the first nation whose handling of illegal immigration deserves criticism			1
but the anti-immigrant riot that took place in a @entity29 neighborhood on may 23 should rise as a rallying cry for @entity4 who believe their country should shine as a " light unto the nations			1
" since @entity36 president @entity38 was overthrown last year , @entity36 's @entity35 , the border between the two countries , has become a mostly lawless land where @entity42 gangs freely traffic in , among other things , human beings			0
migrants who come mostly from @entity46 and @entity47 have chosen @entity4 as their destination because it is one of the most prosperous states in the region and because it offers some protection for refugees			1
despite the protests of right - wing politicians and of some sectors of the population , @entity4 has so far refrained from forcing the vast majority of refugees to return to their native countries			1
many countries keep asylum - seekers in prison - like camps under indefinite detention			2
@entity4 is building a detention facility where refugees would remain while their cases are processed			1
but until now , they have been receiving visas that allow them to live anywhere in the country			0
still , they live in limbo without a right to work legally			0
unlike other countries that have returned refugees to their nation of origin or pushed them back to the state from which they crossed the border , @entity4 , a signatory to the @entity85 , has done neither			1
but the situation is becoming untenable and pressure for deportations is growing			0
government figures say about 60,000 @entity8 migrants now reside in @entity4 , double the figure from 2010 , with between 2,000 and 3,000 more arriving each month			1
the numbers are enormous for a country the size of @entity4			1
it is roughly equal to the number of illegal immigrants found , for example , in @entity99 , a country 350 times the size and triple the population of @entity4			1
@entity4 is hardly the first place to experience anti-immigrant riots			1
and anti-immigrant sentiment there is part of a wave sweeping the globe			0
as in most places where illegal immigration has suddenly increased , much resentment has come from the poor who see the unfamiliar new arrivals settling in their midst , view the newcomers as a threat to their livelihoods and are highly sensitive to reports of criminal activity			1
@entity47 and @entity46 refugees have been arrested in a number of rape and stabbing of cases in @entity29 , but there is no evidence that the crime rate among them is higher than in the rest of the population			0
that , however , has not stopped interior minister @entity131 from tarring migrants as criminals and suggesting that most should be summarily deported			0
the country 's leaders should seek to calm tensions and find a humane solution to a growing human problem			0
but responsible , statesman - like behavior is apparently too much to ask			0
when the residents of the south @entity29 neighborhood of @entity143 held a protest last week , one member of parliament , @entity140 , referred to @entity46 " infiltrators " as " a cancer , " stoking the inexcusable outbreak of violence			0
( she later apologized for using the term " cancer "			0
) another member of parliament , @entity151 , turned up the rhetoric , shouting " expulsion now ! " and calling the migrants " a plague			1
" while some @entity4 expressed sympathy for the protesters , many lashed out against the shocking display of intolerance in @entity29 , of all places , a city known for its open - mindedness			1
although no one was seriously injured and the police intervened , arresting 17 people , the language and the behavior would be unacceptable anywhere , but in @entity4 more than anywhere			2
@entity171 , speaker of the @entity172 , the @entity4 parliament , characterized the event as reminiscent of the early days of @entity174 , saying the words " remind me of the hate speech aimed against the @entity177 people			1
" prime minister @entity179 declared " there is no place for the statements and actions which we saw last night			0
" the day after the riot , @entity4 held a vigil against racism in front of the prime minister 's residence			2
but the reaction on the political scene was not uniformly conciliatory , with new calls for deportations and more irresponsible and inflammatory language from some political leaders			0
@entity4 faces a serious moral and practical dilemma			2
and although the problem has unique aspects because it is occurring in @entity4 , it is a quandary familiar to every country that has faced a large inflow of refugees and migrant workers			1
in @entity4 's case , the prospect that the stream of refugees could grow into a flood raises the added specter that it could transform the @entity177 character of the state			1
despite @entity179 's claim , that is not an imminent danger			0
but the question also tugs , urgently , at another aspect of the country 's identity			0
@entity4 , after all , was founded as the nation - state of the @entity177 people ; a people that saw millions of its numbers murdered while other countries closed their doors during @entity174 and at other times in history			2
@entity4 has not dealt with its refugees more harshly than most countries , despite the exaggerated claims about the events in @entity29			2
but that is not a good enough standard			0
@entity4 need to deal fairly and humanely with the refugees			2
@entity4 are building a barrier at the @entity35 border , which should cut down on the smugglers ' cruel traffic in human beings			2
@entity4 should formalize and legalize the status of a portion of the migrants and work with international agencies to find homes in third countries for others			2
in the meantime , it 's a good time for @entity4 of all stripes to look at their own history and send a strong message to politicians who seem to have forgotten not only the country 's claim to high ethical standards , but an admonition from an ancient text , from @entity258 , recently cited by a hospital manager writing about the serious medical needs of @entity8 migrants			2
" do not oppress the stranger among us			0
you know how it feels to be strangers , for you , too , were strangers in @entity36			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity268 .			0

@entity270 : a *demonstration* against immigrants turned violent in @entity4
she says members of parliament added to the inflamed rhetoric
@entity4 , of all places , should avoid intolerance of those seeking asylum , she says
@entity284 : @entity4 *condemned* the rioting , and @entity4 is not alone in its immigration problem
