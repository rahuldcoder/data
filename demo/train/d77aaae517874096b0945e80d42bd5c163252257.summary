-- the weekend killings at a @entity3 temple in @entity4 have brought a furious fringe genre of @entity7 music out of the background and to the front of the mix. so called hate - rock bands like the one once led by temple gunman @entity12 are increasingly important to the @entity7 white supremacist movement , drawing in new recruits and bringing in cash , according to groups that keep tabs on those groups			1
page was shot to death by police on sunday after killing six people at the @entity3 temple in @entity25 , @entity4 , a @entity26 suburb , investigators say			0
he led a @entity29 - based band called @entity30 for the past several years and played with several groups " in the leading tier " of the genre over the past decade , said @entity34 , author of " soundtracks to the @entity36 , " a book on the subculture			0
opinion : an @entity7 tradition of bigotry bands like @entity12 's are instrumental to bringing disaffected teens into the movement , he said			1
" they 're isolated individuals , often with behavioral problems , perhaps problems at home who are looking for a new familial bond as well as a sense of identity and belonging , " said @entity34 , the head of research for the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49			0
" so white - power music comes in , " he said			1
" it bridges the gap between healthy youth rebellion and hardcore white supremacy , providing that kind of @entity65 identity			1
" once drawn in , hate groups " get these younger kids to do their bidding , " said @entity66 , who once infiltrated the movement for the @entity68			1
" they brainwash them into believing that hate is the way to go and following them is the only way to go , and that there are other races of people that are against the white people , " @entity66 told @entity0			1
meanwhile , the music has become a multimillion - dollar business for a handful of labels , @entity34 said			2
some of those may press as many as 25,000 copies of a well - known band , a respectable figure for an independent imprint , but most produce far smaller numbers of cds or records			0
" it really provides the bulk of the financing , such as it is , that neo-nazi and related kinds of groups are able to earn in this country , " added @entity95 , who tracks white supremacist groups for the @entity98 - based @entity97			1
the movement has followers in both @entity109 and @entity110			2
but in the @entity7 , the @entity111 offers the bands and their labels a protection that they do n't have across the @entity116			2
many @entity109 countries have restricted neo-nazi activities , symbols and statements since the horrors of @entity122 , so the recordings are traded largely on a black market there , @entity34 said			0
white supremacist groups hold occasional music festivals that typically draw about 200 fans , usually held on rural private land because of the difficulty of booking public venues , @entity34 said			1
they 're raucous , often violent affairs in which some of the fissures among different groups flare into " fisticuffs and scuffles , " he said			0
and @entity66 told @entity0 's " @entity139 " that the crowds " have the mindset of a pit bull			1
" opinion : @entity144 respects all , even those who hate " in one moment they 're like a mother pit bull licking their little puppies , and then , 10 seconds later , they 're just off the wall doing something crazy , " he said			1
" their mind snaps , but they love this ... the ones that commit this violence , they thrive on this , and most of them really feel that it 's the government pushing them towards this			2
" but while the stereotype of the skinhead is a brawling , blue - collar kid , " today it 's far more of a middle class or even upper class phenomenon , " @entity34 said			2
he cites the example of @entity175 , a young neo-nazi who targeted blacks , jews and @entity178 in a weekend of drive - by shootings in @entity180 and @entity181 in 1999			0
police say @entity175 killed two people and wounded another 10 before fatally crashing a stolen minivan during a police chase			0
" @entity186 was recruited through the white power music scene , " @entity34 said			1
" he was from an upper , upper middle class family from the wealthy @entity190 suburbs			0
he went to the most prestigious high school in @entity180			0
he came from a stable family and yet was attracted to the movement ... he 's more of the model of the folks today than in the past			1
" that has changed the movement around them as well , as members set up businesses ranging from tattoo parlors to cable - installation contractors to support their activities			2
" it increases the desire for a kind of professionalization in the scene , " he said			0
" so instead of doing this simply as a passion , as true believers , they saw a business model that they could bring to the scene			0
" remembering the victims @entity0 correspondent @entity218 contributed to this report .			0
