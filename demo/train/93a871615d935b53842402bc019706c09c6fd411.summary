-- @entity1 has started to re-enter the public spotlight , very possibly beginning a new stage of her career that may lead to the presidential election of 2016			2
in recent appearances , @entity6 seems energized and spirited			0
she has already begun to talk about issues like women 's rights and voting rights , causes that have animated her for decades			1
gone is the constrained demeanor that turned off many potential supporters in previous years			0
the real @entity1 seems to be emerging			0
republicans are instantly attacking as might be expected			0
former @entity19 speaker and presidential candidate @entity18 , an arch nemesis of the @entity21 in the 1990s , warned that she was promoting " left - wing ideas " that would lead to her defeat			0
those kinds of attacks wo n't have the same weight as they did eight years ago			0
the former first lady , senator , and secretary of state is in excellent position to run the kind of campaign that is true to her history , in large part because of the impact that president @entity37 has had in the past six years			1
@entity38 are more confident about throwing their support behind a candidate who stands proudly for the key tenets of the liberal tradition : a belief that government can help solve social problems in the @entity46			2
unlike her husband , who felt in the early 1990s that he had to emphasize his centrist , new @entity50 credentials , president @entity37 has opened the doors for a @entity52 to build their campaigns on the tradition of the @entity55 and @entity56 , rather than running away from that legacy			1
how did president @entity37 make this happen ? most important , the president has been far more assertive in his willingness to use the federal government to address big domestic challenges than many @entity38 who preceded him			1
the @entity65 put into place a large series of regulations aimed at providing better and more accessible care for a health care system whose costs had spun out of control			0
the @entity74 provided a regulatory framework to prevent the kind of risky behavior that led to the 2008 financial crash , and the economic stimulus provided government money to help get the economy moving again			0
since his re-election in 2012 , an important mark for @entity38 that these kinds of policies do n't result in inevitable defeat , @entity37 has also fought back against the austerity drives of the @entity89 , defending key government programs from the scalpel			1
after the @entity92 weakened the @entity93 , @entity37 vowed to protect the law and attorney general @entity95 announced that he would not allow states to violate rights			2
though hesitant at first , president @entity37 has embraced the major social movement of our dayâ € ” gay rightsâ € ” taking a more progressive stand than any president before him			1
in short , president @entity37 has broken an important barrier for @entity6 , or any other @entity52 , by allowing members of his party to be proud of their ideals and challenging the notion that the only way for their party to win is to agree with the right			1
president @entity37 has also shifted the center of political debate by driving @entity89 further to the right ever since the 2010 midterms			1
tea party republicans have placed immense pressure on the @entity89 leadership to take harder line stances on issues like the budget			0
republicans moved so far to the right they have made @entity38 seem much more moderate			1
@entity38 , who back in the 1990s could still be attacked as " the far left " can appear more " reasonable " to the mainstream when compared with conservative @entity89			2
the tea party has also opened the door to @entity6 , as @entity37 discovered with @entity130 in 2012 , to build a campaign that argues the @entity89 is too extreme to govern			1
in a very different way , president @entity37 has created a huge opportunity for @entity1 because of his failures			1
despite his accomplishments , he has failed to make progress on a number of important issues that @entity6 can embrace as central to her platform , setting her up to be a leader who can complete and move beyond what president @entity37 has started			1
the most important is the economic insecurity of the middle class			0
the sluggish economic recovery and historically high rates of inequality , which @entity37 himself laments but has not been able to reverse , give @entity6 a potent theme to run on			2
@entity149 might call such rhetoric left wing , but for millions of @entity46 it will strike the exact right chord			0
@entity6 , who demonstrated her skill on the international stage , also has a chance to address some of the disappointments with president @entity37 's foreign policy			1
many democrats are watching the events in @entity160 , deeply concerned that the unraveling of democracy will undermine the kinds of promises that @entity37 made about liberal internationalism and the ability of diplomacy to solve global problems without resort to war			1
many democrats are also unhappy with the ongoing revelations about how @entity37 continued with president @entity174 's war on terror programs , making them even more robust with extensive @entity178 surveillance and drone attacks			0
unlike most of the @entity38 who are considering entering into the campaign , @entity6 now has an extensive record of experience on foreign policy that will bolster her credentials as she talks about what she would do to correct these problems			2
if she tackles these issues effectively , she could energize support from liberals in her party who previously dismissed her as the candidate of the status quo			0
even if president @entity37 's approval ratings decline further , @entity6 has an opportunity to win public support using the framework @entity37 put forward			1
@entity1 now has an excellent chance to put together the kind of presidential campaign that was elusive in 2008 , one that could very well give the nation its first female president			0
in the coming months she will have to decide whether she wants to take this step or to instead focus on her work as a global leader outside government			0
but the opportunity for her is there and @entity37 , who once was engaged with her in some of the most bitter fights that @entity38 have seen among their own in many years , has changed the terms of the debate in ways that will greatly benefit her			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219			0

@entity1 speaking out more on liberal causes like voting rights
@entity219 says president @entity37 has made it safe for liberals to assert themselves
@entity89 have moved right , allowing @entity38 ' liberal views to seem more moderate , he says
@entity219 : if she runs , @entity6 could be an outspoken voice for liberal policies
