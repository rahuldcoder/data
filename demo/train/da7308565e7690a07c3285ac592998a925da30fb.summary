-- they 've been spotted and spotted again , those objects in the southern @entity3			1
every time a report comes out that something has been seen that may be related to missing @entity8 , hopes have risen			1
and then , they have fallen			0
it 's seemed like a daily exercise			0
for instance , images taken by a @entity14 satellite and released thursday showed about 300 objects ranging in size from 6 feet ( 2 meters ) to 50 feet ( 15 meters )			1
when photographed monday , they were about 125 miles ( 201 kilometers ) away from the spot where a @entity21 satellite captured images of a floating group of objects sunday			1
could it be ? knowing for sure is a waiting game			0
it will be at least friday before planes can try to find the materials because bad weather in the remote spot has again hampered searching			0
here 's a rundown of how many times we 've been through this : on march 9 , @entity37 's navy spotted a floating object about 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) southwest of @entity37 's @entity39 , which is off the country 's southwest coast in the @entity41 , @entity44 spokesman @entity42 told @entity0			1
@entity37 navy rescue aircraft spotted the object in the evening hours local time			1
because of the dark , the navy aircraft could not get close enough to identify the floating object and was recalled to base			0
three search and rescue boats were deployed to that location			0
several days later , a @entity54 satellite had a sighting that captured a lot of interest but it was later retracted as a mistake			1
it was not in the southern @entity3			1
@entity54 said it captured a " suspected floating object " on march 18			0
the object the @entity54 photographed was 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide ( 74 feet by 43 feet ) , officials said			1
around march 19 , it was reported that witnesses on the ground claimed they saw @entity8			1
a man from @entity68 working on an oil rig off @entity37 claimed he saw a burning object in the sky on the morning of march 8 , hours after the plane had taken off from @entity72 on its way to @entity75			0
then came reports that had many believing " this is it ! " and headlines carried the news			0
but it turned out to be nothing			0
on march 20 , @entity0 quoted @entity83 prime minister @entity82 as saying that authorities had spotted two objects in the @entity3 that were possibly related to the search for missing @entity8			1
those objects have not been found			2
during a march 22 search , a civil aircraft reported that it had spotted some small objects floating , including a wooden pallet , the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) said			1
these objects were within a radius of about three miles			2
a @entity97 @entity96 p - 3 orion was sent to the area , but only reported seeing bunches of seaweed , @entity88 said			0
on march 24 , @entity83 officials said they saw two objects in the southern @entity3 that could be related to the flight			1
one object was " a gray or green circular object , " and the other was " an orange rectangular object , " according to @entity88			0
@entity106 , a @entity0 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity109 @entity108 , appeared on @entity0 to explain why those objects seemed intriguing			2
read her comments " the gray / green is the color of the inside of the aircraft , " she said			0
" a great number of pieces of metal and other things in the aircraft are of gray / green color , everything from the metal in the fuselage and pieces of the mechanical parts ... " @entity130 and bright yellow " are the color of the emergency escape slides , the life rafts inside the plane , " she said			0
" the life vests , but they would n't be that big			0
so there are many things that are those colors that could be a signal that it 's not something that has fallen off a ship but rather that it 's something from out of a plane			0
" the @entity83 naval ship @entity141 did n't turn up the objects when it searched monday night , @entity88 said			2
there is no word yet if those objects have been found or what they are			2
also on monday , a @entity54 military plane said it had seen " suspicious objects " in the same @entity151 @entity109 surveillance plane sent to follow up was unable to find them			2
on wednesday , a @entity21 defense firm provided new satellite images that showed 122 objects floating in the southern @entity3 , not far from other satellite sightings that could be related to flight 370 , @entity153 's acting transportation minister @entity152 said			1
the objects were scattered over 154 square miles ( 400 square kilometers ) , he said			2
@entity152 said he was n't sure if @entity83 authorities coordinating the search for the plane wednesday had been able to follow up on the new satellite images , which came from @entity163			2
read : @entity54 treads carefully amid the anger and grief of @entity8 relatives			1
