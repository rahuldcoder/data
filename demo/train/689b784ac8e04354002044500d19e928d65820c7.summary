-- for a website devoted to exposing secrets , @entity1 is pretty good at keeping its own			2
not much is confirmed about exactly who founded it and runs it , who donates money to allow the five or so full - time people and hundreds of volunteers to keep it going , and where it all happens			0
despite such murkiness , @entity1 has gained international notoriety since it started posting classified documents and other secret information from a @entity18 base in january 2007			2
in april , video of a @entity21 military helicopter strike in @entity22 that killed two @entity24 journalists raised questions about the attack , as well as how @entity1 got the military tapes			1
now , rumors abound that @entity1 is poised to post more video of @entity21 at war , perhaps involving @entity21 air strikes in @entity32 that killed civilians and prompted a military report critical of what happened			1
the @entity36 has taken notice			0
in a secret 2008 report leaked to @entity1 , the @entity38 called the website a potential threat to @entity21 forces and counterintelligence efforts			1
" recent unauthorized release of @entity36 ( @entity36 ) sensitive and classified documents provide @entity49 ( foreign intelligence and security services ) , foreign terrorist groups , insurgents and other foreign adversaries with potentially actionable information for targeting @entity21 forces , " said the report posted on @entity1			1
to @entity56 , the website 's director and only public face , it 's all about providing information necessary for citizens to make decisions that shape their future			1
" all the information in a society , all the happenings in a society , is relevant to choosing to support " a government , political parties and particular leaders , @entity56 said in an interview posted on @entity1 on june 1			1
more revealing was an april interview on the @entity21 comedy show " @entity75 , " in which @entity56 acknowledged to host @entity76 that the goal of posting secret documents was to gain the " maximum possible political impact			1
" for example , @entity56 told @entity76 , he titled the video on the @entity22 helicopter strike that killed the @entity24 journalists " collateral murder " because , he said , that 's what happened			1
at the same time , @entity56 said , @entity1 always provides to the public all the video or documents available so that viewers can decide for themselves			1
" if people have a different opinion , the full material is there for them to analyze and assess , " @entity56 told @entity76			0
@entity1 publishes anonymously submitted documents , video and other sensitive materials after vetting them , it says			2
it claims never to have fallen for a forgery			0
a scouring of internet sources found some basic information about the website , including that it was started by a group of activists that included @entity107 political dissidents and it survives on donations			0
@entity56 , an @entity109 journalist depicted in media reports as a former computer hacker , described @entity1 in a january interview as run by five or so full - time people supported by hundreds of volunteers			2
his work with @entity1 won @entity117 's 2009 @entity116 in the new media category for " @entity119 : the cry of @entity121 -- @entity122 and @entity123 , " a suppressed report on police killings by @entity119 's @entity126			0
in the january interview posted on the @entity128 , @entity56 described an almost covert operation with no headquarters that needs roughly $ 300,000 a year to function as a mostly volunteer organization			2
" but there are people who ca n't afford to continue being involved full - time unless they are paid , " he said , estimating the costs would approach $ 1 million year if that happened			0
he explained the value that @entity1 provides to the mainstream media by publishing otherwise unobtainable information			0
" we take the most legally difficult part , which is not the story , but usually the backing documents , " @entity56 said in the interview			0
" as a result there is less chance of legal action against the publisher			0
" for its own legal troubles , @entity56 said , @entity1 relies on lawyers donated by mainstream media outlets including the @entity152 and the @entity153			2
the website 's biggest @entity21 splash was the april posting of what it said was video from a @entity21 helicopter involved in an attack in @entity161 that killed nine people -- including the two @entity24 journalists -- and wounded two children			1
a @entity38 intelligence analyst was arrested two months later , allegedly for leaking classified military information , the @entity21 military said			0
the website @entity168 identified him as spc. @entity171 , 22 , and said he had leaked the video of the helicopter assault			2
@entity168 reported that @entity171 confessed to the leak in a series of online chats with a former computer hacker			0
he allegedly owned up to leaking other items to @entity1 , including the classified @entity38 document assessing the threat level of the website , as well as @entity182 cables , according to the article public airing of the video forced the @entity36 to defend the actions of its troops in a report that concluded the @entity190 helicopter crews had no way of knowing the journalists -- @entity193 and @entity194 -- were among suspected insurgents on the street			1
now @entity56 is described as living on the run , and the @entity199 @entity198 has passed a proposal intended to make the country a haven for whistle - blowers such as @entity1			1
@entity0 's @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report			0

rumors abound that @entity1 will soon post video *footage* of air strikes in @entity32
in april , website posted video of @entity21 helicopter strike in @entity22 that killed journalists
public face of @entity1 , @entity56 , says goal is to help an informed public make better decisions
