-- more and more , today 's video game business is driven by huge military shooters like @entity5 's " @entity4 : @entity6 " and @entity8 ' " @entity7			2
" now , @entity9 , the founder of a controversial , real - world military group , is stepping into the virtual war zone with a new first - person shooter , " @entity13			1
" designed exclusively for @entity15 's @entity14 , " @entity13 " was developed by @entity16 and overseen by @entity9 , a former @entity17			1
the shooter is set in a fictional @entity20 town overrun by warlords and opposing militia forces			2
players enter the fray as team members of @entity13 , the mercenaries - for - hire company that @entity9 founded in 1997			1
featuring licensed real - world weapons , the game can be played with a traditional controller			1
but it has been crafted to take advantage of @entity14 's motion controls			1
gamers will be able to aim , crouch , and interact with the on - screen action using only body gestures and moves to take out enemies through a series of action - packed missions			1
the game has already courted controversy , since @entity13 employees were linked to the deaths of numerous noncombatants and civilians in the @entity46 while employed by the @entity48 government			1
critics have complained about the game because @entity13 employees take on missions for money , while @entity48 soldiers , the focal point of games like " @entity6 " and " @entity7 , " fight for their country			1
following inquiries by @entity59 into @entity13 actions in @entity61 and @entity62 , including a shootout that led to the deaths of 17 @entity61 , @entity9 changed the company 's name to @entity67 and , in 2009 , resigned as ceo			1
he sold the company last year			2
although the game was created with the aid of former @entity13 employees , the gameplay does not put players in situations where civilians or noncombatants are targets			1
the same can not be said about " @entity79 , " which earned more than $ 1 billion for @entity5 a couple of years ago			2
that fictional game featured an intense airport sequence in which players were forced to target innocent civilians as an undercover terrorist or risk having their cover blown and being executed			2
@entity9 talked to @entity0 in an exclusive interview about the first shooter designed for @entity14 , why he decided to enter the games business and what gadget he ca n't live without			1
@entity0 : why did you decide to enter the video game business ? prince : video games are an exciting medium			2
the creativity of design , the technology and the interaction represent the best of @entity48 innovation			2
my father was a brilliant inventor and businessman			2
he taught me to appreciate the opportunities that @entity48 offers to innovators			2
working with the brilliant creators in this industry was a logical progression for me			0
@entity0 : how involved were you in this game ? prince : i set the overall vision and mission areas for this game			0
my guidelines were to be interactive , tactically correct , fun and expandable , meaning we can add additional missions and accessories to the game going forward			1
@entity0 : what did you learn about how video games are made from this experience ? prince : i now realize that the video game industry is very large and sophisticated , larger even than @entity125 in terms of volume			0
there is every aspect of specialization in the production of these games			0
integrating physical motion into on - screen motion is an exciting new frontier for the industry			1
@entity0 : how do you think the @entity13 brand will appeal to the gaming demographic ? prince : i believe " @entity13 " will have a unique appeal to gamers , particularly on the @entity14 platform			1
the physical , visual and virtual feel of participating in a mission brings a level of excitement and realism to the game that is hard to match			0
and frankly , it 's fun			0
i think gamers will really enjoy playing the game			1
@entity0 : do you play games or have any background playing games ? if so , what have you played lately ? prince : i 'm afraid i do n't have time to play any games these days			0
i certainly played a lot when i was a kid and i know it helped develop my hand to eye coordination			0
@entity0 : what are your thoughts on how video games have evolved over the years ? prince : the video game industry is constantly evolving			0
the sheer creativity matched with cutting - edge technologies gives me the comfort that innovation is alive and well in @entity48			1
and we can see the impact that the gaming industry is having on other entertainment media , as well as military training or flight simulation			0
it 's a fascinating synthesis of ideas , technologies and platforms			0
@entity0 : how does this game being a @entity13 experience differentiate it from franchises like " @entity4 : @entity6 , " " @entity186 " and " @entity7 " ? prince : " @entity13 " on the @entity14 system gets you up and moving			1
you 'll have to act and react with something more than your thumbs			0
it is definitely the next step of progression into a truly interactive experience			0
@entity0 : why do you think simulation military shooters are so popular today ? " @entity4 " is the biggest game franchise of all time			0
prince : the popularity of simulation military shooters today is really no different from the popularity of playing soldier or cops - and - robbers when we were kids			1
take timeless themes of courage , good vs. evil and war , and add today 's technology and you get a very popular genre			0
we 've taken the proven concept a step further with this game by having the player actually have to move their body to navigate the game			1
the military uses video games -- from @entity222 online game to the new @entity223 ( which uses the @entity225 game engine and virtual reality to train squads in war zones )			0
@entity0 : what are your thoughts on the role games are playing in training in the military today ? prince : training for any difficult job is essential			0
combat being the most difficult , it 's the same reason the @entity17 started the @entity239 program during @entity240 , because they were losing way too many new pilots during air combat			0
@entity239 , by giving pilots realistic experiences simulating combat , drastically improved their performance and survivability			0
with video game simulations , @entity249 is providing many of the same sights / sounds and system overloading experiences to soldiers before they encounter a real firefight so they are prepared to make good decisions in the middle of all that stress			2
@entity0 : outside of work , what 's a favorite piece of technology or gadget that you ca n't live without and why ? prince : my kids would certainly comment on my use ( or overuse ) of a @entity271 and @entity272 .			0

gamers can aim , crouch and interact with the on - screen action using only body gestures
critics have complained because @entity13 employees take on missions for money
