sometimes , residents of the @entity1 have a hard time taking a joke			1
this , at least , is how the editor of the satirical blog the @entity7 sees it			2
the website , based in @entity10 and self - dubbed " the world 's only 7 - star satirical news source , " gets roughly 400,000 page views per month and is often likened to @entity14			1
according to its editor , some of the most popular stories are often confused for bona fide fact			1
" judging by the response it gets , i 'd say it 's a 50 - 50 split between those that think it 's a joke , and those that really do n't , " says the editor , who prefers to remain anonymous ( " our stories generate anger from people who are outraged , and i do n't want to be the focal point of that anger , " he says )			2
a story published last month claiming a new gold - class lane would be introduced on the road from @entity10 to @entity38 -- which the site joked would be paved in gold and separated from the other lanes with a velvet rope -- provoked earnest ire			2
faux - elite structures build on the back of internationally - sourced slave labor in lifestyles financed by unearned oil revenues			0
i am appalled at the news that comes out of this country , " wrote one commenter			0

it was also picked up by a few travel websites , and published as fact			2
" even the terribly photoshopped picture , " he marvels			0
as for why his readers seem so gullible , he attributes it to the infancy of satire in the @entity1			1
" satire is n't exactly alien , but it 's not a known concept in the region			1
people here have a tendency to believe everything that is put in a newspaper , " he notes			2
whether the art form is new or not is subject to debate			0
still , many agree that it is ripening in the region			2
" we 've always had room for satire , though maybe it was more widespread in @entity97 -- due to their strong tv channels , political system and level of freedom of speech -- though it 's always been around in @entity90 in terms of play shows , newspaper columnists and caricatures , " notes @entity88 , the @entity90 blogger behind @entity91 , and one of the @entity7 's 4,500 @entity94 followers			1
" i do see it gaining ground now , " he adds			0

" i definitely think there 's a hunger for it , " he says			2
" we get comments from people who say , ' thank @entity122 there 's something like this here , i was going out of my skull , ' and readers are starting to send in their own stories			0
some of the biggest stories have been sent in by readers , and not just @entity132 expats taking the piss out of the country they live in -- most come from @entity54 readers			0
" of course in many ways , the @entity1 is not an easy place to be a satirist			1
earlier this month , @entity140 , the @entity142 talk show often likened to @entity143 , had his show suspended after he started poking fun at the country 's military regime			1
other comics in the region have faced similar fates			0
@entity151 , a @entity152 producer of a political puppet show , was imprisoned for a year on corruption charges , and in july , @entity156 blogger @entity155 was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for mocking religious figures			0
" this is what has put us down as a community , as a population , for so long			0
we ca n't really talk back , " @entity140 told @entity165 in an interview earlier this year			1
" people equate being laughed at as being ridiculed , [ saying ] ' i ca n't be ridiculed by this little dot dot dot brat			0
but if you start to suppress people 's freedom of speech under any excuse you want , it 's not good for the country , " he added			0
@entity7 's editor , who says he admires @entity140 's humor and bravery greatly , finds his suspension from television somewhat ironic			1
" there he was , happily mocking [ former president @entity182 ] @entity181 , and he got arrested , and everyone went out on the street pushing for free speech and he gets put back on air			0
then everything changes , and he goes on air and mocks [ general @entity189 , and everyone 's in uproar			1
in @entity142 , satire is fine so long as it 's going in one direction , which is hysterically satirical in itself			1

the @entity196 is the @entity1 's answer to the @entity14
