@entity0 -- the @entity3 is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more @entity6 troops to @entity7 in anticipation of president @entity10 's decision on the future of the eight - year - old war , a defense official said tuesday			1
@entity10 held a lengthy meeting with top advisers monday night and said tuesday that he would announce plans for @entity7 after the @entity17 holiday			1
a @entity3 official with direct knowledge of the process said there has been no final word on the president 's decision			0
but planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional @entity6 troops into battle with the expectation that is the number @entity10 is leaning toward approving , the official said			1
@entity10 ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to @entity7 in march			1
gen. @entity31 , the @entity6 commander in @entity7 , reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the @entity33 , the @entity34 militia originally ousted by the @entity6 invasion in 2001			1
the president has weighed several options for bolstering the @entity6 contingent , ranging from sending a few thousand troops to sending the 40,000 @entity31 requested			1
@entity31 was among those who took part in monday 's conference with @entity10 and other top advisers , which broke up at 10 p.m. vice president @entity45 , defense secretary @entity46 , @entity48 chairman adm. @entity47 and @entity49 , the @entity6 ambassador in @entity50 , were among the other senior officials in the meeting			1
@entity10 said tuesday that the deliberations have been " comprehensive and extremely useful			2
" " it 's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there , you 've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts , " he said at a news conference tuesday with visiting @entity57 prime minister @entity56			0
the military has planning under way to send these units : three @entity68 brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a @entity71 brigade with about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 ; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of approximately 34,000 troops , according to a defense official with direct knowledge of @entity3 operations			2
@entity1 reported last month that this was the preferred option within the @entity3			0
the troops would be dispatched throughout @entity7 but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces , where much of the recent fighting has taken place			1
currently , brigades from @entity86 in @entity87 and @entity88 in @entity89 are among those that are next in line to deploy			0
about 68,000 @entity6 troops are in @entity7 , along with about 45,000 from the @entity95 alliance			1
two @entity6 military officials said @entity95 countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the @entity3 expects @entity10 to send and the 40,000 @entity31 wanted			1
the request is expected to come during a december 7 meeting at the alliance 's headquarters in @entity104 , @entity105			0
@entity3 spokesman @entity106 would not discuss specific numbers , but he said @entity95 would be asked for additional help			1
" clearly , if the president decides to commit additional forces to @entity7 , there would be an expectation that our allies would also commit additional forces , " @entity106 said			2
@entity6 - led troops invaded @entity7 in response to the @entity120 terrorist network 's september 11 attacks on @entity87 and @entity0			1
the invasion overthrew the @entity33 , which had allowed @entity120 to operate from its territory , but most of the top @entity120 and @entity33 leadership escaped the onslaught			0
@entity33 fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along @entity7 's border with @entity129 , battling @entity6 and @entity7 government forces on one side and @entity129 troops on the other			1
@entity120 's top leaders , @entity135 and @entity136 , remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region			0
the conflict has claimed the lives of more than 900 @entity6 and nearly 600 allied troops			2
a @entity142 poll released tuesday suggests that the @entity6 public is split over whether more troops should be sent to @entity7			1
fifty percent of those polled said they would support such a decision , with 49 percent opposed			0
the poll found that 66 percent of @entity6 believe the war is going badly , up 11 percentage points from a similar survey in march			2
overall support for the war has fallen to 45 percent , with 52 percent opposed			0
@entity152 sound off ; share your views on sending more troops in @entity7 @entity7 was among the topics @entity10 and @entity56 discussed in their meetings tuesday			1
@entity56 said the international community needs " to sustain its engagement in @entity7 , to help it emerge as a modern state			2
" " the forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated , " he said			0
" president @entity10 and i have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism			2
" @entity57 is one @entity7 's biggest international donors , contributing $ 1.2 billion in aid			2
that involvement has been met with suspicion in @entity129 , @entity57 's nuclear rival in @entity175			0
but it has helped the @entity6 by sharing some of the burden of stabilizing the country and providing civilian support			0
in addition , several leading analysts have argued that settling the decades - old tensions between @entity57 and @entity129 would allow both sides to pull troops off their borders , giving @entity129 more resources to battle the @entity33 along its northwest frontier			0
" i think that will certainly be at the center of the agenda this week , " @entity188 , a former @entity189 official , said on @entity1 's " @entity190			0
" @entity6 prospects in @entity7 depend partly " on convincing @entity129 to be more cooperative in the fight against those terrorist groups			1
" " the @entity6 is not going to be an outright mediator between @entity129 and @entity57 , but we can quietly , behind the scenes , push them to reduce their problems , " @entity188 said			0
@entity1 's @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
