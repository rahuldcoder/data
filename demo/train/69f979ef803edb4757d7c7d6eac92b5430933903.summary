-- pilots botched the approach and landing of @entity6 in @entity7 nearly a year ago , causing a crash that killed three people and injured 187 others , @entity2 safety investigators concluded on tuesday			1
but the @entity11 also found that crew training and the complexities of a key flight system on the @entity15 and how it was described in operating manuals contributed to the july 6 disaster			1
investigators , however , primarily faulted the crew of the @entity21 - based carrier for not fully executing intricate systems of the jetliner packed with more than 300 people before it struck a seawall and careened down @entity27 trailing sparks and debris			2
read the @entity11 's accident report summary in a final report on its probe , the board found that the flight crew mismanaged the plane 's descent being carried out without the help of navigational instruments and one of the pilots unintentionally deactivated a system that automatically regulates airspeed			1
the crew also delayed its decision to abort the landing with the plane flying too slowly to avoid catastrophe , investigators found			0
the final conclusion was largely in line with early assumptions of investigators facing the most serious commercial airline crash in the @entity2 since a @entity56 commuter plane fell out of the sky over @entity58 , killing 49 people in february 2009			1
crew actions were also singled out in that accident			2
aviation experts agree that aircraft automation has made flying safer , and the 777 is one of the most sophisticated jetliners in service			0
" but the more complex automation becomes , the more challenging it is to ensure that the pilots adequately understand it , " @entity67 , the acting safety board chairman said in a statement			0
" in this instance , the flight crew over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand			0
as a result , they flew the aircraft too low and too slow and collided with the seawall at the end of the runway			0
" @entity83 fined $ 500,000 for failing to help families @entity83 crash victims sue @entity15			2

the @entity11 *released* its final report on the 2013 accident
investigators said actions by the *cockpit* crew caused the crash in @entity7
the @entity15 crashed short of the runway ; three people were killed , 187 hurt
