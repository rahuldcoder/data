-- as though there were not enough tumult in @entity3			1
a year after revolution felled a longtime dictator , a new crisis has soured its strongest @entity8 ally and threatened to sever military aid			1
@entity3 authorities had been investigating civil society organizations for a while but they stunned @entity14 officials by announcing this week that 43 foreigners , including 19 @entity14 , working for civil society organizations would face prosecution			1
@entity3 officials blamed ongoing unrest in their country on foreign interference			1
authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 organizations including the @entity14 - based @entity25 , @entity26 and the @entity27			1
among those going to court is @entity30 , son of @entity31 , the transportation secretary			0
not a wise decision by the @entity3 , said journalist @entity33 , author of " @entity34 : inside the @entity35			1
" " you never ever mess with the son of a ( government official ) , " @entity33 said			0
" i never expected foreigners would be sent to trial			2
i started to think that maybe they really believe these people are spies			0
" @entity33 was not alone in his reaction			0
several analysts said they were surprised the @entity3 chose to provoke @entity14 at such a critical juncture in their post-revolutionary journey ; to bite the proverbial hand that feeds them			1
what makes this crisis even tougher is that there are no easy solutions to stave off tensions			2
the @entity3 say the pro-democracy organizations had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license			1
but some of the groups had been tacitly operating for some time in @entity3 without permission , even under @entity60			2
@entity62 spokeswoman @entity61 said the groups targeted did not fund candidates or parties			0
" there is nothing new in their activities , " she said			0
@entity70 viewed the move as a crackdown on democracy and threatened to cut off more than $ 1.3 billion in military aid that was conditioned on @entity3 's progress in transitioning to democracy			1
top officials including secretary of state @entity79 and defense secretary @entity80 lashed out			0
and 41 members of @entity82 urged the administration to withhold further aid to @entity3 until authorities allow the offices of the targeted organizations re-open			1
" we have underscored how serious a problem these actions are			0
we have said clearly that these actions could have consequences for our relationship , including regarding our assistance programs , " @entity91 spokesman @entity90 told reporters monday			0
@entity61 declined to speculate about possible consequences but said the dispute " is a very , very difficult situation in terms of the support we want to provide @entity3			2
" the drama continued tuesday when sen. @entity103 , the ranking @entity104 on the @entity105 , told @entity0 that an @entity3 military delegation visiting @entity70 had canceled meetings with senior @entity14 lawmakers at the last moment and returned to @entity3			1
@entity103 , the ranking @entity104 on the @entity105 , did not give a reason why the @entity3 backed out but it was n't hard to guess			2
" what is happening now is that both sides have painted themselves in a corner and they do n't have an easy way to get out , " said @entity111 , a senior associate at the @entity112 of the @entity113			2
the @entity3 have now made a legal case and the @entity14 will find it difficult to tell them to interfere with the work of the judiciary when they are trying to push democracy , @entity111 said			1
one @entity3 official told the @entity126 newspaper : " @entity14 can not preach to us night and day about the need to abide by the rule of law and then ask us to break the law to serve their interests			1
" the @entity14 entree into @entity3 is through its military leadership -- @entity70 has no relationship with the political leaders of the @entity136 , which has a majority in @entity3 's parliament			1
so it can not afford to simply cut off @entity3 , @entity111 said			1
at the same time , @entity3 must find a way to expedite legitimate trial and release the @entity14 to protect its relationship with @entity70			1
@entity111 said the military often blames foreign forces in having a hidden hand in anti-government protests			2
" this is what the military is doing , " she said			2
" unfortunately , they are not blaming some nebulous group			0
it 's a big mess			0
" the crisis may also have been fueled in part by the a great sense of nationalism on the government 's part , said @entity159 , a senior fellow at the @entity160			0
" it 's better in the short term to be seen as standing up to the @entity14 , ' she said			1
in recent days protesters have returned to @entity165 's @entity164 , demanding an end to military rule			2
some of those protests , in the wake of soccer riots that killed 79 people , have turned deadly			0
" as the situation continues to be very unsettled in @entity3 , the powers that be will look for a scapegoat , " @entity172 said			2
" blame your problems on outside powers			0
that 's how it has been throughout history			0
" accusing activists of receiving foreign funds is not new , either			0
under @entity60 , dissident @entity184 was accused of using @entity186 money for election monitoring			0
he was tried twice before a higher court dismissed the case			0
@entity33 , who covered @entity184 's trial , said he believes the @entity3 courts will back down on the foreigners			1
" i think the @entity3 understand the depth of the hornet 's nest , " he said			1
but what @entity33 fears most are the consequences for a half - dozen @entity3 pro-democracy groups that have also been accused of receiving foreign money			1
they are not the ones in the spotlight , he said			0
but they are the ones who will feel the wrath of authorities the most			0
@entity0 's @entity207 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 authorities crack down on foreign organizations
among those facing trial are 19 @entity14
angry @entity14 *lawmkers* threaten to cut off military aid to @entity3
