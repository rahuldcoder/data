-- while the eyes of golfing world were on rising star @entity4 on thursday , two surprise names claimed the first - round lead at the @entity6			1
a tearful @entity7 overcame the recent death of his father to shoot a superb five - under - par 65 despite difficult early conditions -- then late in the day 20 - year - old amateur @entity11 shocked everyone by joining him at the top of the leaderboard with a record - breaking effort			1
the duo share a coach , but apart from that their stories could not be more different			0
the 40 - year - old @entity7 was able to tee off at @entity20 -- where he blew his best chance of winning a major title in 2003 after squandering a four - shot lead on the last day -- only after several players pulled out , including @entity25 and lastly @entity26 on monday			1
ugly and unforgiving : why @entity27 offers golf 's toughest test the @entity30 , 11 times a winner on the @entity32 , has made the halfway cut just twice since his father passed away in may following a long illness , but at the windswept @entity35 links course he rediscovered the form that earned him two winning @entity39 appearances			1
" @entity44 meant a lot to me , " the world no. 80 told reporters before wiping tears from his eyes			0
" he would have been very proud of what i did today			0
that 's all i 've really got to say about that			0
" today was a massive step in the right direction for me			0
i have been finding golf extremely difficult but i did a lot of work with ( coach ) @entity54 ( @entity55 ) yesterday and some things just started to make a bit of sense			0
" i do n't know if i can keep this up for the rest of the week			0
the start - all - over process has taken a lot longer than i wanted to , but i suppose that 's part of the process			2
let 's just say i have realized this year there 's more important things in life than golf			2
" @entity11 has already tasted success at @entity20 , having won the @entity27 boys ' amateur title there in 2009			1
his father @entity75 , a former tour professional , named him after five - time @entity6 champion @entity77 -- who was one of the @entity35 's playing partners , with the 61 - year - old @entity79 ending the day equal 71st after a 72			1
showing no nerves in such illustrious company , @entity11 carded the lowest round by an amateur at golf 's oldest tournament , surpassing the 66 shot by @entity88 in 1950 , @entity25 ( 1996 ) and @entity89 ( 1998 )			1
he also became the first non-professional to lead the tournament after the opening round since 1968			2
" it was really great out there today , " @entity11 told reporters			2
" when we started , i heard a lot of shouts like , ' come on @entity11 ' but i suspect they might have been for the other @entity11 , not me			2
but in the end i thought maybe there were a few for me , -- it would be nice to think so anyway			0
" @entity11 birdied four of his last five holes to catch @entity7 as they took a one - shot advantage into friday 's second round from @entity109 veteran @entity108 and @entity79 @entity110 and @entity111			1
@entity110 , who won the @entity112 , finished with three successive birdies while @entity114 -- still seeking his first professional title -- picked up shots at the last two			0
they were two shots ahead of a group of 12 players tied for sixth place , including @entity79 pga champion @entity123 of @entity124 , 2010 @entity126 winner @entity125 and former @entity128 @entity39 star @entity127			1
among that cluster was @entity79 debutant @entity130 , a 23 - year - old who qualified for the 140th staging of the tournament when he finished second at the @entity134 's @entity133 last weekend			1
@entity4 , playing for the first time since winning his breakthrough major at the @entity126 three weeks ago , battled back from a bad start to card a one - over 71 for a share of 51st			1
the 22 - year - old bogeyed two of his first three holes , but responded with birdies at the eighth , 13th and 17th holes to match the score of world no. 1 @entity146 , second - ranked @entity147 , @entity126 runner - up @entity146 of @entity148 and @entity150 's masters champion @entity149			1
the @entity152 , seeking to be the youngest winner since 1893 , led last year at @entity153 's after a first - round 63 , but crashed with 80 in the second			2
" i struggled a bit with my speed all day on the greens , but it was a day where you just needed to grind out a score , and anywhere around even par was a good start , " @entity4 said			1
" on a day like this you can shoot a high number and put yourself out of the golf tournament , so it was nice to go out and shoot a decent score			0
i feel like if you keep it around level par this week you 're going to have a good chance			0
" @entity146 , who like @entity147 has never won a major , is one of the favorites following his victory at last weekend 's weather - shortened @entity174			0
the @entity35 carded two birdies and a bogey in his front nine , but dropped three shots between 11 and 15 before pulling one back at 17			2
they were a shot better off than @entity79 @entity182 , who was in another sizeable group tied for 36th on 70 that also included @entity109 's @entity185 , after carding two birdies and two bogeys			0
@entity182 's compatriot @entity188 , the 1995 winner , was tied for 71st on 72 along with @entity150 's 2002 champion @entity189 and reigning titleholder @entity190 .			0

@entity7 takes early *clubhouse* lead in first round of @entity6
@entity196 golfer , whose father died in may , cards five - under - par 65 in @entity198
he is joined at the top by 20 - year - old @entity35 amateur @entity11 as they lead by one
@entity126 champion @entity4 battles back from bad start to card 71
