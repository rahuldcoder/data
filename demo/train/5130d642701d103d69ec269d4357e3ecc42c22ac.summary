-- @entity1 believes all the pressure is on @entity3 as the title rivals head into their @entity6 championship decider in @entity7 this weekend			1
@entity1 trails the reigning two - time champion by just 13 points going into sunday 's final grand prix of the season at @entity12 but has tried to play down his own chances			1
" the first priority is to be on the podium , which gives us a possibility to score more than 13 points and then we need to wait for the result from @entity21 , " he told thursday 's official press conference			1
" it is not in our hands , we have not much to lose -- the only possibility is to win something			0
if he ( @entity3 ) wins , fine			1
we try again next year			0
" there is always pressure but we have less than other occasions and less than leading the championship			0
we have nothing to lose , " added the @entity31 ace			2
@entity21 's @entity3 admitted that the pressure of expectation of an historic third straight title was real			1
" it 's obviously normal if you are in that position , " he admitted			2
" we are in a strong position , we can be happy with that , but we have to focus on every single step to get the job done here , " added the 25 - year - old @entity39 , who would be the youngest driver to achieve a hat - trick of world championships			2
@entity1 said it was unlikely that his @entity31 would challenge the @entity49 or @entity50 in qualifying where he has been consistently off the pace			1
" there is no magic that you can put in the car in five days			0
we were seventh in @entity57 ( qualifying ) , ninth in @entity60 , so those positions should be normal but hopefully we can do a better job			0
" @entity1 battled through in @entity60 to finish an eventual third at the @entity65 @entity64 last sunday to keep his title hopes alive behind winner @entity67 and second - placed @entity3			1
the @entity68 was helped by @entity31 's decision to enforce a gear box change on teammate @entity72 's car , dropping the @entity7 five places on the grid and moving @entity1 up to a more favorable position at the start			1
@entity3 , who could have clinched the title at the @entity78 , said he was untroubled by the controversy surrounding the move			1
" what they do is not in our hands			0
i did n't follow up whether @entity72 had real trouble with the gearbox or not , but it is not our job to focus on these things , " he said			0
" it is a different approach compared to our team			0
that is how life is , everyone handles certain situation in a different way			0
" @entity67 is racing in his final grand prix for @entity50 after a big - money switch to @entity98 and is desperate to sign off with a win			2
" it 's going to be a tough one , but we will try to push as hard as we can , as we did in the last race , to try to win			2
i 've never won here before , " he said			0
the race also brings down the curtain on the @entity6 career of former seven - time champion @entity105 , who is quitting for the second time after his largely fruitless return with @entity98			1
" i 'm quite happy to finish here and go for a different life , " he admitted .			0
