@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's new paramount leader , @entity3 , is making the fight against corruption his no. 1 mission			1
in several speeches since he took over the reins of the @entity9 last november , he has warned that corruption could lead to " the collapse of the party and the downfall of the state			1
" @entity3 sees corruption as a threat to the party 's legitimacy			1
he exhorted fellow leaders to learn from the experience of other countries where " corruption has played a big role in conflicts that grew over lengthy periods , and ... led to popular discontent , social unrest and the overthrow of the political power			1
" he did not mention names , but clearly he was referring to @entity31 , @entity32 and other authoritarian and corrupt regimes that have been overthrown in the wake of the @entity36 revolutions			0
@entity3 urged officials to " build a clean government , show self - discipline and restrain their relatives and associates			1
" chosen to lead the cleanup is @entity43 , 64 , who until recently was @entity1 's economic - finance czar and now is chief of the party 's anti-corruption body			1
@entity43 , also known as a " firefighter , " is a no - nonsense , blunt - talking administrator and has been a go - to trouble shooter			1
in the 1990s , he was sent to @entity50 to clean up the " debt crisis " in the southern province			1
years later , he was dispatched to @entity54 province to curb rampant smuggling and corruption			1
in 2003 , he was called to @entity0 to replace the city mayor accused of covering up the sars crisis , the massive pandemic that spread across @entity1 and beyond			1
@entity43 's political skills will be put to test in his new job			1
corruption has long been a major public complaint , and there is certainly no shortage of cases			1
in the past five years , @entity1 has punished 668,400 people for " party discipline violations " and more than 24,600 suspects have been referred for investigation , according to @entity72			2
there are various ways to acquire ill - gotten wealth and just as many to hide them			0
some spirit millions of cash out of the country			0
others stash them in luxury villas , expensive jewelries and accessories -- or business ventures by relatives and associates			0
still others blow their loot enjoying sybaritic lifestyles , lavishing wealth on mistresses or simply gambling it away in casinos			0
disgraced politicians include : - a lowly bureaucrat who despite a modest salary has been found to be wearing expensive - looking watches on various occasions			0
internet watchdogs have dubbed him " brother watch			0
" - a senior official now known as " @entity103 " who was found by government officials to own 21 houses despite being on a meager income			2
- a district @entity9 chief in @entity110 , who was fired after being caught on video having sex with a young woman who was alleged to be a prostitute			2
- the former chief of @entity116 , who was sacked and accused of receiving bribes of 47 million yuan ( $ 7.5 million ) between 2005 and 2010			2
- the @entity119 provincial deputy secretary who was removed for alleged " serious discipline violations , " the most senior official to have fallen since the new leaders took over in november			0
to be sure , @entity1 has been making efforts to crack down on graft			0
from may 2011 , the amended @entity125 criminalizes bribery of foreign government officials and officials of international public organizations			1
it also regulates the use of gift cards to curb money laundering , illegal cash withdrawals , tax evasion and bribery			0
the current solution largely focuses on punishment instead of prevention -- " kill the chicken to scare the monkey , " as the @entity1 put it			0
execute one and deter 100			0
@entity144 , experts say , is better than investigation and punishment			0
in a recent meeting , @entity43 said " trust can never replace supervision			1
" he is now calling for " institutional prevention and punishment of corruption			2
" @entity43 recently summoned eight experts to solicit ideas			1
most advocated a system of requiring party officials to disclose their assets			2
in fact , the notion of public disclosure of official 's assets was proposed some 18 years ago			1
@entity165 ( no relation to @entity167 member @entity43 ) , then a delegate to the @entity164 , @entity1 's legislature , submitted three bills proposing the idea in 1994 , " public disclosure of property in @entity1 is really difficult , and it 's especially difficult to make it a system			1
our goal is to establish a system , not just punish some people , " he said in december			0
@entity179 , a professor at @entity180 and an expert on corruption , proposes a form of amnesty that will give officials until the end of 2013 to declare their assets publicly			2
those who do so will be exempted from punishment for any acts of corruption			2
@entity192 's government adopted a similar move in 1977 to root out mafia - related corruption in what was then a colonial state			1
@entity43 supports the idea but agrees that persuading officials to come clean will be next to impossible			1
in fact , about one million officials of certain rank are already required to report their assets -- but only internally			0
" after the declarations are made , they are kept in a black box , and they become scrap of paper , " @entity202 complained			0
@entity43 , the delegate , says the key is making asset declarations accessible to the public			1
" if the common people can not find out their assets , if nobody except themselves knows the truth , it can not solve the problem			0
" " it 's like asking the left hand to supervise the right hand , or asking the mother to supervise her son , " he added			2
" it 's impossible for the mother to send the son to the police when he commits the crime			2
" eighteen years after @entity43 first proposed his " sunshine policy , " it still remains on the drawing board			1
small wonder many @entity1 doubt the government 's sincerity in fighting corruption			1
bloggers point out that , by contrast , the legislature took only a few days to deliberate and pass a new law that requires internet users to register under their real names			0
the new law is meant to crack down on @entity242 scams and junk mail and " protect the public from baseless and libelous accusations			2
" but critics say it will merely blunt the power of the microblogging site @entity249 , which whistleblowers use to expose cases under pseudonyms without fear of retribution or punishment			0
in the absence of the " sunshine law , " muckraking @entity1 turn to the @entity242 to expose official abuse			0
despite heavy government restrictions and self - censorship , internet activists have cleverly used @entity249 to spot and expose corrupt officials			0
@entity1 now has over 400 million @entity249 users , and microblogs have become " an inescapable snare for corrupt officials , " according to the official @entity266			0
" the miraculous microblogs have become the nightmare of the corrupted			0

new leader @entity3 sees corruption as a threat to the party 's legitimacy
@entity43 , chief of party 's anti-corruption body , will lead cleanup of government
he has a record of handling debt crisis in @entity50 , coverup of @entity284 in @entity0
corruption has long been major public complaint
