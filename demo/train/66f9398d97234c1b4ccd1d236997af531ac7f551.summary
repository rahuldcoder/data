-- it 's 10:45 a.m. on a cloudy day , and the crew of @entity5 flight @entity3 is preparing to land at their home airport of @entity8 , @entity9			1
suddenly , ominous warnings start blaring , alerting them that their flight angle is all wrong and their rate of descent is far too fast			0
they fly a series of unconventional right - and - left banks through a narrow channel of hillsides before centering the swaying jet and putting it on the tarmac			0
an excess of government buildings and restricted airspace make it challenging to land at @entity28 's @entity27			1
an emergency situation ? not quite			0
in fact , this is a completely normal -- however nail - biting -- landing at @entity32 , set 7,300 feet above sea level			1
because of the airport 's tightly cropped valley , surrounded by 16,000 - foot - high serrated @entity38 peaks , this drama replays itself on every flight			0
there 's a sobering saying among pilots : " any landing you can walk away from is a good landing			1
" and it 's not until you fly into places like @entity8 , or @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , that the adage starts to make sense			1
both are surrounded by mountains , and @entity48 has one of the world 's shortest international runways ; each requires a series of hard last - minute banks			2
it 's no wonder both give even the most seasoned pilots -- not to mention their passengers -- the sweats			2
while @entity9 is the most extreme example -- only eight pilots in the world are qualified to fly into @entity8 -- a number of the world 's airports , from @entity72 in the @entity73 to @entity74 in @entity75 , can present challenges for pilots			1
" a lot of these airports require additional training and route familiarization because they 're so crazy , " says one commercial pilot who flies international routes			1
slideshow : travel + leisure 's list of the scariest runways according to aviation experts , mitigating factors range from the truncated length of runways to unique atmospheric and meteorological conditions , dramatic geographical settings , heavy air traffic , or a combination thereof			0
" sometimes it 's just the way the airport is laid out that makes it a pain , " says the pilot , referring to whether an airport is situated askew			2
one such tricky spot : @entity27 , in @entity104 's not because of strange @entity106 winds or the pressure of being watched by statues of past presidents			1
it 's the excess of government buildings and restricted airspace that makes setting down here like threading a needle with a 200 - ton hunk of metal			1
in fact , cities are often tough : for years ( 73 , to be exact ) , the honor of the world 's most harrowing airport was reserved for @entity123 's @entity122 , whose single runway was jammed in between @entity126 and densely populated @entity127			1
pilots had to battle crosswinds and fly a complicated curved approach , all while dodging mountains and high - rises			2
@entity122 was shuttered in 1998 and replaced by a modern mega-port located on a reclaimed island out in the @entity135			0
but many locales do n't have that luxury , and continue to operate with their existing facilities , many of which include palm sweat - inducing approaches and photo - worthy opportunities			0
travel + @entity145 : scariest runways and it 's not always the landing that 's the stuff of lore			0
@entity153 , in the tiny @entity151 kingdom of @entity152 , features a stunted 1,312 - foot - long runway perched at the edge of a couloir that sits at 7,550 feet			0
according to celebrated bush pilot @entity160 , depending on the wind during takeoff , it 's entirely possible for the aircraft not to be airborne by the end of the airstrip			2
" instead , " he says , " you shoot off the end of the airstrip , then drop down the 2,000 - foot cliff face until you start flying			0
" it 's enough to make you take the train			2
