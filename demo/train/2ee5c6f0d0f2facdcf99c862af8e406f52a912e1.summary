late on the night of last september 11 , @entity1 ambassador to @entity2 @entity0 spoke to his deputy for the final time from the diplomatic compound in @entity6 , @entity2			0
" @entity9 , we 're under attack , " @entity0 told @entity7			2
within hours , @entity0 and three other @entity1 were dead , victims of an armed terrorist assault that has since become a political and foreign policy flashpoint in @entity15 's partisan wars			0
the dramatic narrative recounted by @entity7 at a six - hour @entity19 - led @entity18 hearing on wednesday reflected the knowledge of a high - level insider who was in @entity2 that long night and was deeply involved in trying to react to events			1
his efforts to determine the circumstances of the attack and muster help for those under siege in eastern @entity2 were later praised by his superiors and by president @entity30			2
the step - by - step account riveted the @entity33 proceeding that was also marked by sharp partisan exchanges over the merits of continued congressional inquiries over the attack			2
what the @entity30 administration has said about the @entity2 attack republicans once again accused the @entity30 administration of trying to cover up the fact that it was a well - orchestrated assault by militants , failing to adequately explain events to the public , and then refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators			1
democrats once again accused @entity19 of using tragedy for political gain			1
@entity7 -- praised by @entity19 as a " whistleblower " but who says he has since been effectively demoted -- was joined at the witness table by @entity52 , a former regional security officer in @entity2 , and @entity54 , the @entity55 's acting deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism			1
our goal " is to get answers , declared committee chairman rep. @entity60 , @entity62			2
" the administration , however , has not been cooperative			2
" @entity7 described in personal detail how he missed @entity0 ' initial call and then reached him by cell phone as the attack unfolded in phases			2
" i got the ambassador on the other end and he said , ' @entity9 , we 're under attack			2
' " he recounted the efforts of a security response team on site that drove back the attackers , and " repeated attempts " by those on the ground to enter the burning compound to try and rescue @entity0 and others			0
he then said that @entity0 was at a hospital that was controlled by a group that he said @entity87 feeds identified as leading the attack			2
was it a trap to lure more @entity1 ? then the worst news about his boss			0
" i received a call from the prime minister of @entity2			0
i think it 's the saddest phone call i 've ever had in my life			0
he told me that ambassador @entity0 had passed away , " @entity7 said			0
mother of @entity6 victim : i blame @entity102 a slow - to - evolve explanation oversight committee @entity19 continued to go after televised remarks by @entity107 ambassador @entity106 five days after the attack			1
in them , she insisted it was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-islam film that turned violent			0
@entity19 critics believe @entity114 was shielding @entity30 at the height of his re-election campaign during which there were times that he trumpeted @entity1 successes in combating terrorism , including the death of @entity124 leader @entity123 in 2011			1
administration officials say @entity114 was using official talking points that relied on the best available information at the time			1
rep. @entity129 , @entity130 , asked @entity7 if there was any evidence early on that the attack was a protest			1
" no , there was none , " @entity7 said			0
" i 'm confident ambassador @entity0 would have reported a protest immediately if one appeared on his door			2
" @entity7 also said an inflammatory anti-muslim @entity142 video initially cited as a cause of the alleged protest was " a non-event in @entity2			2
" he previously insisted administration officials immediately knew the culprit was @entity124			1
" i think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning , " @entity7 told investigators in interviews before the hearings			2
in fact , @entity7 said during the hearing that he was told by the @entity2 president soon afterward that elements with possible terror links were thought to be behind the assault			2
the veteran diplomat said his " jaw dropped " and he was both " stunned " and " embarrassed " when @entity114 said the attack was a response to the @entity142 video			0
@entity167 calls for @entity18 to release @entity6 emails @entity7 also argued the @entity1 military could have blunted the attack by scrambling intimidating military aircraft from @entity173 's @entity172 -- an assertion denied by @entity176 chairman @entity175 when he testified before @entity177 in february			0
@entity175 told @entity177 it would take up to 20 hours to scramble the aircraft to get to @entity6 ; @entity7 said he believed it would take two to three hours			0
" i was speaking from my perspective ... on the ground in @entity182 based on what the defense attache told me , " @entity7 said when asked by rep. @entity185 of @entity186 , the top @entity187 on the @entity33 panel , asked @entity7 if he had any reason to question @entity175 's assertion			1
finally , @entity7 claimed four members of the military were ready to board a plane from @entity182 to @entity6 , but were prevented from doing so by their superiors			0
" how did the personnel react at being told to stand down ? " asked rep. @entity195 , @entity196			0
" they were furious , " said @entity7			0
" i can only say , well , i will quote lieutenant colonel @entity199 who said , ' this is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military			0
' " @entity207 officials insist the members of the military in question were told not to go to @entity6 because they were not equipped for combat , and were needed in @entity182 to care for wounded headed their way			0
analysis : @entity55 failed to understand dangerous situation in @entity6 @entity52 said in written testimony it was " inexplicable " that a followup internal @entity55 review ignored " the role senior department leadership played before , during , and after " the attack			1
in the run - up to the hearing , @entity60 trickled out testimony from the witnesses in an apparent attempt to build anticipation for the session , one of several that have occurred in @entity177 focusing on security at the compound and the administration 's response			1
committee @entity233 accused @entity19 of engaging in a " smear " campaign			1
" what we have seen ... is a full - scale media campaign that is not designed to investigate what happened in a responsible and bipartisan way but rather a launch of unfounded accusations to smear public officials , " @entity185 said			1
@entity18 spokesman @entity243 also weighed in , telling reporters that the @entity6 attack " is a subject that has from its beginning been subject to attempts to politicize it by @entity19			1
" he defended defended the administration has " made extraordinary efforts to work with " @entity177 on multiple investigations			0
four @entity1 killed in @entity6 : why ? accusation of playing politics for its part , the @entity55 also accused @entity18 @entity19 of playing politics with the tragedy			1
" this is not sort of a collaborative process where the committee is working directly with us in trying to establish facts that would help , you know , as we look to keep our people safe overseas in a very complex environment , " @entity55 spokesman @entity258 said on monday			1
read the document ( pdf ) wednesday 's hearing is another chapter in what has become an epic back and forth between @entity233 and @entity19 on @entity6 , partly stemming from @entity114 's televised comments			1
the comments are widely believed to have cost her a likely nomination to succeed @entity102 as secretary of state			0
some congressional republicans previously sharply questioned @entity278 over the administration 's explanation of events and the state of security at the compound at the time of the attack			1
@entity278 has said that she accepted responsibility for the deaths , declaring that as secretary of state , she was " in charge of the @entity55 's 60,000 - plus people all over the world			1
" in january , @entity278 testified for more than five hours before the @entity18 and @entity295 committees			0
in her testimony , she acknowledged a " systematic breakdown " on @entity6 and said her department was taking additional steps to increase @entity1 security at diplomatic posts			0
at one point at that hearing , @entity278 barely controlled her anger as she responded to a lawmaker who pressed her on the administration 's post-attack storyline			1
critics have questioned the validity of continued congressional scrutiny , especially @entity233 , who say @entity19 are only interested in discrediting the administration and hurting @entity278 's chances if she were to run for president in 2016			1
former deputy chief of mission in @entity2 : @entity1 military assets told to stand down one @entity19 congressman , @entity320 's @entity319 , used the hearing to criticize top @entity278 adviser @entity322			1
@entity7 said he received a call from @entity322 , who he added was not happy that a @entity55 lawyer -- described by @entity19 as a minder -- was excluded from a briefing on @entity6 in @entity2 with @entity7 , a @entity19 congressman and others			1
@entity7 has been " praised by everybody who counts , the president , the secretary , everyone above him , " @entity319 said			0
" and yet now , they 're obstructing -- because he wo n't -- he wo n't help them cover this up			0
" but former @entity278 aide @entity334 disputed that characterization , saying the @entity55 took a cooperative approach with @entity177			1
he said in a written statement that @entity322 had , in fact , called @entity7 to support him			0
" she wanted ( people on the ground in @entity2 ) to know that no matter how far away they were from home , they were n't alone , " @entity334 said			0
" she was with them , and most importantly ( secretary @entity278 ) was with them			0

@entity55 official says he never believed the attack was a protest
key lawmaker says administration is not cooperating with investigation
rep. @entity185 accuses @entity19 of trying to " smear " officials
another hearing witness said it was " inexplicable " attack review ignored key points
