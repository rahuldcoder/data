-- " terrorist funding emanating from @entity2 remains a serious concern			1
" so states a cable prepared for the visit of @entity7 special envoy @entity6 to the kingdom earlier this year			2
it is one of several that have appeared on the @entity13 site to indicate that despite some progress , the flow of cash to extremist groups in @entity17 and @entity18 from individuals and charities in the @entity21 has certainly not been halted			1
the cable , written by @entity7 ambassador @entity24 , says that the @entity2 are " cooperating more actively than at any previous point to respond to terrorist financing concerns raised by the @entity7 , and to investigate and detain financial facilitators of concern			1
" it says the @entity2 @entity30 had begun to detain individuals involved in funding networks for groups such as @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , an extremist @entity17 group that carried out the @entity37 attacks in 2008 , the @entity38 , and @entity39			1
but it says donors in @entity2 " continue to constitute a source of funding to @entity44 extremist groups worldwide , especially during the @entity45 and @entity46			1
" and it adds the kingdom remains " almost completely dependent on the @entity50 to provide analytic support and direction for its counterterrorism operations			0
" the @entity54 has led efforts to block sources of terrorist funding , establishing the " @entity61 " and sending specialists to @entity59 , @entity18 , and elsewhere to help follow the money			1
it also established an office in @entity64 , @entity2 , in 2008			0
treasury sources said earlier this year that other @entity66 had been less co-operative than the @entity2 ; and other cables obtained by @entity13 describe hundreds of millions of dollars in cash being flown from @entity59 to various destinations in the region			1
the @entity2 authorities have made some high - profile arrests in the last two years			0
ambassador @entity24 's cable says the @entity75 timed its announcement in august 2009 regarding the arrest of 44 terrorist supporters " to deter potential donors from giving money to suspected terrorist groups during @entity46			0
" however , one leaked cable sent by @entity7 secretary of state @entity84 in december 2009 noted that " it has been an ongoing challenge to persuade @entity2 officials to treat terrorist financing emanating from @entity2 as a strategic priority			1
" it adds : " donors in @entity2 constitute the most significant source of funding to @entity44 terrorist groups worldwide " -- running into millions of dollars			1
" @entity64 has taken only limited action to disrupt fundraising for the @entity95 1267 - listed @entity38 and let - groups that are also aligned with @entity97 , " the cable from @entity84 says			0
it also expresses concern that the @entity38 might use the cover of reconciliation talks to raise funds			0
@entity104 resolution 1267 lists groups and individuals accused of involvement with @entity97 , the @entity38 and other extremist groups			0
it is not only @entity2 sources of cash for terrorists that have caused concern			1
the cable sent by @entity84 notes that while @entity117 has clamped down on domestic terror suspects it " has been less inclined to take action against @entity117 - based financiers and facilitators plotting attacks outside of @entity117			0
" in particular , the cable says that while the @entity7 had designated the @entity117 - based @entity126 for providing support to @entity97 and associated groups , the government of @entity117 " has not taken significant action to address or shut down @entity124 headquarters or its branches			2
" @entity130 , the society 's chairman , has denied allegations that @entity124 has links with terrorist groups			0
the leaked cables also express concern that weak regulatory oversight in the @entity142 ( a growing financial hub ) " makes it vulnerable to abuse by terrorist financiers and facilitation networks			2
" as for @entity145 , the cable from @entity84 says it has " adopted a largely passive approach to cooperating with the @entity7 against terrorist financing			1
@entity145 's overall level of @entity149 [ counter-terrorism ] cooperation with the @entity7 is considered the worst in the region			2
" the cable asserts that although @entity145 's security services have the capability to deal with direct threats and occasionally have put that capability to use , " they have been hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the @entity7 and provoking reprisals			2
" a long section on terrorist financing in @entity17 repeats the frequent charge that " some officials from the @entity166 ( @entity166 ) continue to maintain ties with a wide array of extremist organizations , in particular the @entity38 , @entity34 and other extremist organizations			0
" it says a " network of social service institutions readily provides extremist organizations with recruits , funding and infrastructure for planning new attacks			0
" among the groups identified are " @entity180 and @entity181 , and all successor organizations that continue to funnel money and provide other forms of support to the @entity38 and @entity34			0

@entity7 cables *published* by @entity13 assess terrorism funding in the @entity21 region
" terrorist funding emanating from @entity2 remains a serious concern "
the @entity2 government is cooperating with the @entity7 more than ever before
but donors in @entity2 " continue to constitute a source of funding " to @entity44 extremists
