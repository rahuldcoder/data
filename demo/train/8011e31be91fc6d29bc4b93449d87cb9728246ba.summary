-- historically in the @entity4 , communities of color and the police have maintained strained relationships			1
the death of @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , has stirred up dormant , yet strong emotions			1
@entity7 was tragically killed by a police officer in august			1
his case has yet to be resolved			2
residents in @entity8 plan to march starting friday in a " @entity14 " to demand the resignation of the local prosecutor			1
when we pull the lens out and take a larger look at the issue we are faced with similar situations across the country , as in the case of @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , or the case of @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30			2
when conflict between police and communities of color occurs , the issues of racism , profiling and bias simmer to the surface			1
these moments create pause for many @entity4			0
familiar questions come up : " why did the police shoot ? what made them make the decision ? " each of these regrettable encounters has to be evaluated case by case based on specific circumstances , even if there may be substantial historical and cultural undercurrents of racial issues that run through them			1
we can not draw blind conclusions ; we have to seek the truths			0
we have to seek answers that will provide both communities of color and police agencies with a better understanding of the problems and tools to fix them -- together			1
a collaborative effort could result in building better communication , and more importantly , trust			0
this week , i was invited to a community meeting in @entity73 , @entity74 , that was attended by about 100 people from diverse social and economic backgrounds			0
the event came about as a reaction to the vivid images in the media surrounding the conflict between the @entity83 communities and police			2
a 9 - year - old asked me : " why do police shoot people ? " as i looked down into his face , it was clear that he was afraid			2
the fear in his eyes seemed to ask if he would somehow be deliberately harmed by police			2
a 16 - year - old @entity83 asked what she should do if she is pulled over by the police at night			0
then a woman asked : " if i were stopped by the police and asked to step out of the car , should i ? " these are the types of questions that are often asked by people of color			2
the ongoing reports of incidents in the news have only increased their anxieties			0
but police have a hard job to do			0
they are here to protect and serve the communities they work and live in			1
they are trained to follow policies and procedures while working in potentially dangerous situations			0
police officers do the very best they can in circumstances that are often unpredictable			1
in enforcing community laws , police officers are given a great deal of responsibility , latitude and discretion			1
it is essential that we support and respect police officers and the daily challenges they face			1
their decisions and actions are constantly being evaluated and at times second - guessed			0
this creates an environment of suspicion and mistrust , which in turn creates a distance between the police force and those they serve			0
it is unfortunate that there are communities where citizens feel they can no longer trust their local police officers and other law enforcement agents			1
how we can remedy this situation ? what do you do or say to ease the fear of a 16 - year - old who is concerned about driving home at night and being pulled over by a police officer ? as a first step , we need to start a discussion in communities			1
we need to listen to people 's concerns and work together to forge a better understanding of each other			2
we must have trained professional police officers who will stand for us , be with us , and protect us			1
when we see police or hear police we should know that they are coming to help us or someone else			0
in order for our society to function optimally and effectively , we have to do away with the negative emotions			0
i strongly encourage that police and community members meet to dispel and reduce the anxiety and fear that is on both sides			1
police officers are human , too			1
across the country , there are police departments that are doing a fantastic job and there are others that are beyond challenged			0
but we all have to do our part to establish , maintain and nurture strong and collaborative relationships			0
we have to find a way to meet in the middle where both the community and police can trust each other ; otherwise there will be anarchy			2
as the national president of the @entity191 , i understand the importance of equality and human rights			0
we have to be fair and impartial to everyone and know that we all have a shared responsibility in maintaining a safe community			0
trust is something we have to work toward in this country .			0
