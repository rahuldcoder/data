-- missionaries from @entity2 had hoped they would n't have to become involved in the clinical care of @entity5 patients in @entity6			1
but by june , they realized they had no choice , says @entity8 , vice president of international programs and government relations for @entity2			1
the deadly ebola virus had spread from @entity11 to @entity12 and @entity13			2
at the time , nearly 400 cases and more than 200 deaths had been reported			2
now there are more than 1,711 suspected and confirmed @entity5 cases in the region , including 932 deaths , according to the @entity20 , and the epidemic has spread to @entity22			1
@entity2 believes these numbers represent fewer than half of the real number of cases , @entity23 said thursday at an emergency congressional hearing on the @entity5 outbreak			1
" the @entity5 crisis we are now facing is not a surprise to us at @entity2 , but it took two @entity34 getting the disease in order for the international community and the @entity34 to take serious notice of the largest outbreak of the disease in history , " @entity23 said			1
he characterized the initial international response to the @entity5 outbreak as a " failure " because the virus spread outside the country where the outbreak originated			1
he said that a broader coordinated intervention is the only thing that will slow the size and speed of this disease			0
" the ministries of health in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 do not have the capacity to handle these crises in their countries , " @entity23 said			2
if the international community does not get involved , " the world will be relegating the containment of this disease that threatens @entity6 and other countries to three of the poorest nations in the world			0
" @entity66 director dr. @entity65 agrees that the number of people who have been infected with @entity5 is likely undercounted			1
that 's in large part , he said at the hearing , because there are a limited number of lab facilities there to confirm the cases accurately			1
ebola virus : nine things to know about the killer disease that 's why developing a better lab system is so important , he said			0
the @entity66 is working with international partners , the @entity84 and the @entity85 to bulk up the lab infrastructure in @entity6 and to develop a better way to transport blood samples to those labs			1
what 's most important , @entity65 said , is that people understand that there is a clear way to stop this outbreak -- and that 's at the source in @entity6			0
this , he said , is the only way to get it under control			0
it requires local knowledge and local action			0
" the roots of our @entity5 fears stopping the epidemic will be particularly challenging since the local health system is so weak , he said			1
while the @entity66 will send at least 50 staff in the next week or two , the health system has to be beefed up to stop and prevent future outbreaks			2
@entity65 said that someone once told him the @entity66 is the world 's 911 system			2
while he appreciated the compliment , he wants to make sure that every country or region has its own 911			0
@entity5 is here : 5 reasons not to panic dr. @entity119 © ndez , the assistant administrator for the @entity120 for @entity121 , said that @entity122 is providing funding to help with the response to this outbreak			1
they are coordinating a response with local health workers and have provided 35,000 sets of protective equipment , supplies , soap and water			0
many health care workers are still laboring in the region without protective gear , which is why these workers make up a large portion of @entity5 cases			1
there was a sense of optimism at the hearing			0
" we are confident we can contain and stop the virus , " said @entity144 , the @entity145 's deputy assistant secretary for the @entity146			0
the @entity145 is working closely with the governments of all the countries impacted by the outbreak			2
they are trying to help health care providers gain access to affected areas			0
they are also giving technical and financial assistance to treatment centers			0
@entity144 said an international response will be essential			0

@entity2 leader : initial response to @entity5 outbreak was a " failure "
affected @entity174 countries do n't have *ability* to contain the virus alone , he says
@entity66 director says number of @entity5 cases likely undercounted
