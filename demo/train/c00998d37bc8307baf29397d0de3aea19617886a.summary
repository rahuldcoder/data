throwing your keys at the parking valet as you sashay onto a flight may seem like the stuff of @entity7 films , but already a robotic valet is taking the sweat out of getting on a plane at @entity13 's @entity12 airport			1
rather than getting behind the wheel , however , this robotic valet physically lifts your three tons of road machinery and slots it into pre-designated robot parking bays			2
nicknamed ray by its creators , the automated forklift truck is the brainchild of @entity13 's @entity22			1
aimed at business travelers in a hurry , the automated parking system can be controlled and booked via an app. all travelers have to do is drop the car off in a designated area , go to a nearby touch screen to confirm the car is empty , and @entity32 does the rest			1
@entity32 uses sensors to measure and photograph the car , it then gently lifts it and takes it to one of 249 parking spots reserved for the robot forklifts			2
the company claims that its space - saving system -- which uses lasers and sensors to measure not just the height and width of the cars but accessories such as wing mirrors and fenders -- can park 60 % more cars than a human driver			1
the system is also connected to the airport 's flight data system : @entity32 will retrieve the car based on flight itineraries			1
the app also lets car owners communicate with @entity32 if there are any flight delays			1
the airport charges € 29 a day ( $ 40 ) or € 4 ( $ 5.50 ) an hour for the service , which the airport 's management said was likely to appeal to time - strapped corporates			1
" our product is especially appealing to business travelers , who arrive at the airport shortly before the flight , seek efficient parking , and return within a few days , " @entity66 , the airport 's managing director , said in a statement			1
a new tie - up with @entity76 announced this month aims to increase the efficiency of @entity32 by getting the car and the parking robot to communicate with each other			2
" our jointly developed technology exchanges data automatically between @entity32 and @entity76 cars via @entity85 and thus facilitates the parking progress , " said @entity81 , the managing director at @entity82			1
but @entity32 is not the only robot valet on the block			2
a @entity90 startup called @entity91 also aims to take parking to the next level by using an automated parking system that can park hundreds of cars without human intervention			1
shuffling them like the squares in a giant @entity99 in garages that need no light and little ventilation , the company says the system not only saves on energy but can fit more cars into a smaller space , freeing up valuable land for other real estate			0
according to @entity113 ceo @entity112 the advantage of his system is that it is designed with multiple entry bays , multiple robots and multiple lifts so there is no single point of failure			0
" if any one thing goes down , we can still operate the system , " he told @entity0			0
drivers put their car into a parking bay that places the car on a large steel tray			0
robotic wheeled platforms slide under the vehicle and then transport it to the bays following buried wires in the floor of the carpark			0
@entity112 says its increased throughput means the bays can be filled and emptied more quickly than conventional carparks			0
" our system is installed in a garage with level concrete floors so there 's total fire separation between floors like in a conventional garage - most legacy systems are steel rack structures with no separation between floors , " he said			2
" developers like it because you can park 100 % more cars in the same space and that 's a big value proposition			1
" the other advantage is that the carpark is a ' sterile ' environment that has no need for human intervention			0
" the cars are not running in these garages so there 's a big savings on air handling equipment , " @entity112 said			0
" you need seven or eight air changes an hour with traditional carparks versus just one or two with this system			0
" similarly , there 's also no need to illuminate the building to the sort of levels that would deter muggers or other attackers that lurk in the gloom of multi-story carparks			0
" robots do n't care if it 's dark , " @entity112 said			0

@entity13 's @entity12 airport has installed a robotic parking system called @entity32
it can be controlled via an app and retrieves cars based on flight arrivals data
it can park 60 % more cars than a human operator and costs $ 5.50 an hour
