@entity0 -- will it be a boycott or a chaperone ? @entity5 @entity4 remained undecided friday on whether they would join a select committee created by majority republicans to investigate the @entity9 terror attack			1
the chamber 's @entity4 leader , rep. @entity10 of @entity12 , described a split in her caucus over the matter in remarks to reporters that lambasted @entity7 for what she called a " political stunt , " " subterfuge " and a " diversionary tactic			1
" options under consideration include participating as a minority bloc , which @entity7 have proposed ; having a lone member take part to register disapproval but maintain a presence , or rejecting the entire process as a partisan witch hunt			0
" the question is what are the terms under which @entity4 can participate , " @entity10 said , citing the need for her side to concur with any committee decision to issue subpoenas			1
a spokesman for @entity5 speaker @entity40 said it was @entity4 who have to decide what to do			1
" the ball is in their court , " said the aide , @entity44			0
however , a letter from @entity10 to @entity40 later friday rejected the @entity7 stance as " fundamentally unfair " and said it would politicize the process			1
@entity40 , meanwhile , used a glitzy @entity51 post akin to a concert or pro-wrestling poster to announce the seven @entity7 to serve on the new panel chaired by @entity7 rep. @entity56 of @entity57 , a former prosecutor			1
joining @entity56 on the panel were @entity59			0
@entity60 of @entity61 , @entity62 of @entity63 , @entity64 of @entity65 , @entity66 of @entity67 , @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70 of @entity71			0
political posturing @entity40 created the select panel to streamline other committee investigations of the september 2012 armed assault on the @entity77 diplomatic compound in eastern @entity78 killed four @entity77 , including ambassador @entity79			2
@entity9 -- government cover - up or right - wing conspiracy theory ? @entity7 have complained since the attack , which came less than two months before president @entity84 's re-election , that the administration failed to properly secure the compound , neglected to send military assets to try to save the besieged @entity77 and then tried to cover up exactly what happened			1
the @entity5 and @entity4 counter that multiple investigations have found security deficiencies , but not the kind of wrongdoing alleged by @entity7			1
@entity10 took aim at a chief @entity7 inquisitor , @entity95 chairman @entity94 of @entity12 , saying friday that he botched his panel 's probe and @entity40 now needed to distance him from the matter			1
" @entity94 just is damaged goods , " she said			0
" they had to move from him to another venue with another chairman			0
that 's what this is			0
we have been there and done this over and over again			0
" in her letter to @entity40 , @entity10 said the @entity7 plan for the select committee 's membership and process would permit what she called the " unacceptable and repeated abuses " of @entity94 's management of oversight committee investigations			1
@entity4 complain of leaked information , denied witness requests and other actions by @entity94 they consider improper and blatantly political			0
" we find it fundamentally unfair , " @entity10 wrote , adding that " this process must not be politicized			1
" @entity40 's choices to fill out the @entity7 membership of the select committee include @entity125 , one of @entity94 's top attack dogs on the oversight panel			1
@entity7 targets @entity129 for @entity7 , the issue presents an opportunity to attack then - secretary of state @entity129 , the overwhelming favorite for the @entity4 presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run			1
@entity134 is polling well so far against all likely @entity7 challengers , and the emotional @entity9 issue offers republicans a chance to exploit one of her few potential vulnerabilities			1
a nearly party line vote of 232 - 186 on thursday established the panel despite investigations by multiple @entity5 committees that have reviewed documents , interviewed witnesses and held numerous hearings			2
seven @entity4 backed the formation of the committee			2
most face tough re-election bids in " red " districts			0
@entity7 plans call for the seven @entity7 named by @entity40 to be joined by five @entity4 on the committee , which would have subpoena powers			1
@entity4 argued friday that the special panel was a political ploy to keep the controversy in play during a midterm election year			2
" we are trying to find a way to make this work but the @entity7 have shown no inclination to make it work , " rep. @entity161 of @entity162 told reporters			2
" if this is going to be a true bipartisan inquiry , we will participate			0
if it is engineered to be a @entity7 campaign strategy , it is much harder for us to participate			0
" keeping up the pressure @entity40 has kept up the pressure on @entity9 , saying thursday that new questions about the @entity84 administration 's handling of the matter now required the @entity5 " to respond as one institution " to arrive at the truth			1
@entity129 : no reason for new @entity9 committee he said the committee would have robust authority and its investigation " will not be a partisan process			2
" in moving ahead with the committee , @entity40 said that " a line was crossed in two places			0
" first , he said documents unearthed by a conservative watchdog that surfaced last week raised questions about the administration 's explanation of events after the attack			0
he also said the administration defied a congressional subpoena to turn over information			0
there has been intense controversy over early statements linking the attack to a spontaneous protest over an @entity206 film produced in the @entity77 that had sparked demonstrations elsewhere at the time			0
but it was soon revealed that @entity9 was a coordinated terror attack @entity7 allege the administration politicized its response in a presidential election year			2
the @entity5 has said the new information cited by @entity40 was broad - based and not specifically related to @entity9			2
@entity215 : the biggest mistake @entity4 could make on @entity9 @entity5 @entity7 are unlikely to bend to @entity4 demands on the details of the committee , a @entity7 source familiar with the matter told @entity1			1
but when pressed about whether @entity7 would make changes to give @entity4 more power in the investigation , @entity40 would only say that " there are further conversations continuing on that issue			2
" those talks were said to be intense			0
one aide told @entity1 that @entity4 recognized they were unlikely to get changes they outlined in a letter to @entity40			0
but the aide said that " the calculus on this is being weighed -- do we participate in a @entity94 - like committee or worse , or is it worth having someone in the room for it ? " opinion : a guide to @entity7 's @entity9 obsession			1
