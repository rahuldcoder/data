@entity0 -- you could read the entire 1,582 - page , $ 1 trillion omnibus spending plan announced in @entity5 monday night			1
or you can check out our handy cheat sheet of some of the key winners and losers in the plan			1
winners little kids : big winners			1
funding for the @entity16 and early @entity16 programs would jump by $ 1 billion			2
that 's $ 1 billion more than last year 's low point after budget cuts			2
the mentally ill : social - worker - turned - @entity23 - chairwoman @entity22 , @entity24 , has long pushed for mental health programs			1
this year she got them an additional $ 173 million dollars more than their funding level with last year 's budget cuts			2
disabled veterans and surviving families : no longer would a planned cut in pensions hit " medically " discharged military retirees or military spouses or children who depend on military pensions			0
federal workers and active military : a 1 % pay raise would come to both groups of furlough - and sequester survivors			1
details of the $ 1 trillion spending bill g - men : the @entity47 stands to gain $ 700 million + over the funding it got following last year 's budget cuts			1
@entity51 : the agency gets a hefty $ 651 million increase to help it make up for budget cuts in the past			0
seated handshakes : the photo of @entity22 and @entity59 chairman @entity58 , @entity60 , sealing the deal is a double win : a more natural - looking , lawmakers - at - work shot than the traditional standing handshake			2
and it masks the significant height difference between the two powerful lawmakers			0
@entity70 : ( and see below			1
) no gain in funds , but no loss of funds , either			0
given the razor - sharp opposition to the health care law , a spending bill that does n't get snagged in the @entity70 debate ( and vice versa ) could be considered a win			1
@entity81 looks to bypass @entity5 to press ' @entity82 ' appropriations committees : think of it as a reality game show that no one would enjoy			0
the chairmen and staffs of the @entity59 and @entity23 appropriations committees had less than a month to agree on 12 detailed spending bills and fold them into one 1,582 - page document that both parties could sign			2
losers @entity96 : the deal restores some of the funds cut by sequester to the @entity96 , but not all			2
in a summary of the measure , republicans boasted that with this bill , they have cut the @entity96 's funding by 20 % since 2010			0
@entity104 : the tax agency 's funding has been cut to 2009 levels , according to the @entity108			1
and just to send a more direct message , this appropriations bill states that the agency can not use its funds to target citizens or groups based on their ideology			0
@entity116 : you have millions of passengers to screen everyday and now @entity5 has capped the number of employees you can hire			0
if passed , the deal would set a limit of 46,000 @entity116 screeners and require the @entity116 to find a way to make half of the traveling public eligible for " expedited " screening by the end of this year			0
senators seek compromise on unemployment standoff @entity133 : two reasons			1
sen. @entity135 , @entity136 , told @entity1 the deal fully funds a @entity139 missile defense system in @entity140 , which the @entity133 do not like			1
the measure makes it harder for the @entity139 to buy weapons from @entity133 , including some controversial helicopters			1
to get around the ban , the omnibus requires the @entity147 to reveal the number of anti-aircraft missiles the @entity133 weapons agency has sold to @entity152 's @entity151			1
@entity70 : ( and see above			1
) if the @entity81 administration needs more funds to implement the health care law , it is n't going to get them from @entity5			0
the bill does n't add any funding and also blocks the administration from dipping into a prevention fund as a backup pool of money			0
generals and admirals : @entity165 and general officers in the military would see a cut in their staff expense budgets under this plan			0
the president of @entity172 : the bill specifically prohibits any of its funds from going to " the direct personal benefit of the president of @entity172			0
" portrait artists : the bill bans government officials from spending money to have a portrait made			0
@entity181 : no funds for you			1
the @entity185 governor hoped to get some federal funds for his dream of a $ 60 billion high - speed rail line between @entity189 and @entity190			2
but @entity191 successfully blocked the idea in this deal			0
@entity81 , @entity194 to talk women 's poverty issues			0

little kids , the mentally ill and g - men are among the winners
@entity133 , @entity181 and the @entity104 are among the losers
@entity70 -- both a winner and a loser
