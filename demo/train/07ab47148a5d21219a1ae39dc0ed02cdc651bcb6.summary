@entity17 , an attorney for @entity4 's former wife , @entity18 , confirmed to @entity0 that the hearing was continued but declined to offer more details on the case			0
@entity4 announced online friday in a lengthy @entity23 post that he was being summoned to court in what he described as " yet another lawsuit " from his ex-wife as part of a long - running custody battle			1

@entity42 said over the weekend she did n't know @entity4 was going to share the break - up with the world through @entity23 and found out about the post through media reports			2
