the airline industry has seen fewer travelers take to the skies in the wake of the global financial downturn and rising fuel costs			2
the knock - on result is that flight operators too , have had to cut costs			2
in some cases that meant reducing routes or removing the additional amenities like the airline goodie bags of socks , toothpaste and eye masks			0
but one thing that has n't changed is the care and attention paid to the fine wines and champagnes available on board			2
according to wine connoisseurs and airline experts , the aviation world purchases several million gallons of wine annually and with many operators providing the finest vintages on offer , airline budgets can go into millions of dollars			2

@entity41 , the editor - at - large of @entity44 's @entity43 tells @entity45 : " what happens at altitude is that the product does n't change , it 's the way you perceive it that changes			1
within your body you perceive less of the fruit that is in a wine and more of the acidity and more of the tannins , the hard texture , you 'll get in red wines			1
" ironically , some of the finest wines in the world , some of the finest @entity62 , actually do n't taste good at altitude , " he says			1
" some sweeter wines from say @entity67 or @entity68 which are fruitier but softer to drink , merlot , pinot noir wines are often more fun to drink than cabernet sauvignon wines in the air			2
" @entity41 also points out the act of air travel , which can often leave a traveler dehydrated and in a state of some tension , can also have an effect on the taste of a glass of wine for a passenger			2
@entity84 is the master sommelier for the world 's largest airline , @entity86 , which serves seven million bottles each year			1
he is charged with the mammoth task of finding wines with a rich bouquet and unique palette , while also providing passengers with a vibrant array of choices			1
" we 're not certain why things change but what we can say is that ...			0
we need to pick wines that ramp up the intensity , that ramp up the character and flavors			2
" passengers are given the choice of a champagne , two reds and two whites , but give little consideration as to how or why that particular wine was chosen by the airline during planning stages , which see wine choices made often months or even a year in advance			1

" i also need to know that the fruit is so forward that the wine is expressive , that the wine has so much to say that at 35,000 feet i can still smell it , " he adds			0
@entity84 meets with the rest of his team once a year and they go through the wine options provided for tender and pick 75 blends for the following year			1
if a wine can pass the altitude taste test and make it on board , the producing vineyard has a great opportunity to broaden its market			1
certainly for the first class cabin or business class , @entity84 says : " [ winemakers ] see that as a really sexy place to be -- as a place they want their label to be seen			1
" an airline 's selection often reflects the national and regional preferences of their passengers			0
with @entity86 , @entity84 chooses a variety of new and old world wines			1

[ but ] that 's painting with a very broad brush			0
" other flight operators pride themselves on taking the opportunity to showcase their national range of wines			0
for example , @entity171 say they invest over $ 25 million dollars in the @entity174 wine industry annually through their @entity171 wine program			0
the program has a panel of wine judges and winemakers who choose a diverse selection of 250 specially chosen local wines			1
@entity183 , @entity171 executive manager customer experience says : " we pride ourselves on developing a selection of wines , from the latest wines made by boutique winemakers to the iconic drops that form the very base of @entity174 's great winemaking legacy			0
" and it seems this national focus has paid off for the airline , who earlier this year , won six accolades at the @entity198 , a 27 - year - old internationally - recognized competition that focuses on naming the airlines with the best wines annually			1
@entity41 says that for countries like @entity174 , who have strong wine production industries , showcasing a national wine selection is not unusual			0
" you could argue that for airlines like @entity171 , that 's not so difficult			0
@entity209 ... you could argue that they would find it easy			0
the @entity213 airline for example , there are some very good @entity213 wines but you 've got a smaller range to choose from , " he says			0
" there is a question of how open is the tender ? the ideal is obviously an airline with deep pockets that is prepared to buy wine from a broad range of countries and is aware of what you need to have to be serving wine in the air			0

airlines might be cutting costs but not when it comes to their annual wine budget
wines must be carefully chosen for consumption at altitude as human palette changes
