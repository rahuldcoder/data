-- when president @entity2 called for a world free of nuclear weapons in @entity5 , @entity6 , this spring , many dismissed this part of his speech as idealistic rhetoric			1
but the abolition of nuclear weapons is not an unrealistic fantasy			1
it is a practical necessity if the @entity15 people are to have a secure future			2
president @entity2 should use his @entity18 speech this week to reaffirm his commitment to this essential and obtainable goal			0
it is essential because a world armed with nuclear weapons is simply too dangerous for us to countenance			1
since the end of the @entity26 we have tended to act as though the threat of nuclear war had gone away			1
it is only our awareness of this danger that has faded			0
in fact , there are some 25,000 nuclear weapons in the world today ; 95 percent of them are in the arsenals of the @entity15 and @entity39			1
just this past weekend , the @entity41 treaty limiting the number of @entity15 and @entity39 warheads expired			1
negotiators in @entity45 , @entity46 , have not yet been able to work out the details of a follow - up treaty			0
we must hope they will be able to agree to deep reductions			0
a recent study by @entity52 showed that if only 300 of the weapons in the @entity39 arsenal attacked targets in @entity15 cities , 90 million people would die in the first half hour			1
a comparable @entity15 attack on @entity39 would produce similar devastation			1
further , these attacks would destroy the entire economic , communications and transportation infrastructure on which the rest of the population depends for survival			0
in the ensuing months the vast majority of people who survived the initial attacks in both countries would die of disease , exposure and starvation			0
the destruction of the @entity15 and @entity39 would be only part of the story			1
an attack of this magnitude would lift millions of tons of soot and dust into the upper levels of the atmosphere , blocking out sunlight and dropping temperatures across the globe			0
in fact , if the entire @entity39 and @entity15 strategic arsenals were involved in the fighting , average surface temperature worldwide would fall 10 degrees centigrade to levels not seen on @entity92 since the depth of the last ice age 18,000 years ago			1
for three years there would not be a single day in the @entity96 free of frost			0
agriculture would stop , ecosystems would collapse and many species , perhaps even our own , would become extinct			0
this is not just some theoretical scenario ; it is a real and present danger			2
on january 25 , 1995 , we came within minutes of nuclear war when @entity39 military radar mistook a @entity108 - @entity15 scientific rocket for a possible attack on @entity110			1
president @entity111 , a man reportedly suffering from alcoholism and other major medical problems , was notified and given five minutes to decide how to respond			0
then as now , both the @entity15 and @entity39 maintained a policy of " launch on warning , " authorizing the launch of nuclear missiles when an enemy attack is believed to be under way			1
we do n't know exactly what happened in the @entity122 that morning , but someone decided not to launch @entity39 missiles and we did not have a nuclear war			1
january 25 , 1995 , was five years after the end of the @entity26			2
there were no unusual crises anywhere in the world that day			2
it was a relatively good day in a time much less dangerous than our own			0
and we almost blew up the world			2
that was 15 years ago and the @entity15 and @entity39 still maintain more than 2,000 warheads on high alert ready to be launched in 15 minutes and to destroy each other 's cities 30 minutes later			1
nuclear weapons are the only military threat from which @entity15 armed forces can not protect us			1
it is urgently in our national security interest to eliminate these instruments of mass annihilation from the arsenals of potential adversaries			0
if we have to get rid of our own nuclear weapons to achieve this , it is a deal well worth making			1
make no mistake , the elimination of nuclear weapons is an attainable goal			1
these bombs are not some force of nature			0
they are the work of our hand			0
we built them and we can take them apart			0
some governments falsely see these weapons as safeguards of their security			2
it will not be easy to convince them that true safety requires that we abolish them			0
nor will it be easy to design the verification regime needed to assure that the weapons are dismantled and that no new weapons are built			2
yet national security experts in the @entity15 and around the world say that it can be done and it must be done			2
if politics is the art of the possible , then statesmanship is the art of the necessary			0
and if ever there was a time that cried out for statesmanship it is now			0
there are many important issues that demand our attention -- health care reform , energy policy , creating more jobs -- but none is as urgent as eliminating the threat of nuclear war			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity195 : abolishing nuclear weapons is not an unrealistic fantasy
@entity195 : threat of nuclear war still real , still *terrifying* and did not go away with the @entity26
@entity195 : about 25,000 nuclear weapons in world ; 95 percent in @entity15 and @entity39
@entity195 : many important issues , but none as urgent as eliminating threat of nuclear war
