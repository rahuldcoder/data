-- january 4 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity12 , @entity13 : hi ! happy new year ! we hope you had a wonderful break			1
my name is @entity19 , and @entity0 is kicking off 2010 right here , right now			1
first up : @entity20 @entity21 : first up , the @entity23 government closes its embassy in the @entity26 country of @entity4 , and that is because of security concerns			1
one official says that a group called @entity31 might be planning an attack against the facility			1
that same group said it was behind an attempted plot to set off an explosive onboard a plane heading to @entity38 , @entity39			1
that took place on christmas day			1
the suspect allegedly brought the explosives on the plane in his underwear			1
the plan failed when the device he tried to use did n't detonate correctly			2
some people have asked how the suspect made it past security			1
one @entity23 official says it 's because of human error			1
president @entity56 has promised that everyone involved in the attack will be held accountable for it			2
but some critics argue that the president 's response to the situation has n't been fast enough , has n't been aggressive enough			1
the president also announced that the suspect was trained by @entity31			2
that 's the same terrorist group we mentioned before			1
the @entity23 military has been working with the government of @entity4 for a while to fight @entity31 terrorists			2
@entity72 looks at how that fight has played out in the past			2
( begin video ) @entity76 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : @entity4 forces earlier this month on a raid against @entity31 just north of the capital of @entity80			2
the military shouts , " come out			2
it is better for you			2
" shots are fired and several suspects are finally captured			2
this was one of @entity4 's efforts to hit back at @entity31			1
@entity23 assistance with several recent strikes that may have killed some of these men is now openly acknowledged			2
@entity93 , yemeni foreign minister : they are @entity4 armed forces attacks			2
they were , of course , supported by @entity23 intelligence and by the training of the @entity4 armed forces			2
@entity101 : what 's next ? the @entity23 military and the intelligence community are looking at everything they have got on @entity31 in @entity4			1
strikes are expected to continue and could involve @entity23 missiles or aircraft , sources say			2
the @entity23 and @entity4 are looking for targets linked to the attack of @entity112			2
but direct retaliation has n't always worked			2
former u.s. president bill clinton : our target was terror			2
there will be no sanctuary for terrorists			2
@entity101 : in 1998 , after @entity31 attacked @entity23 embassies in east @entity124 , president @entity122 ordered cruise missile attacks against targets in @entity127			2
but @entity31 was untouched ; key operatives had long fled the area			2
@entity23 retaliation that worked : it happened in @entity4 back in 2002			2
a @entity23 drone fired a missile			2
one of the dead was an @entity31 operative believed to have been behind the october 2000 attack on the @entity138 warship @entity136 in @entity4 that killed 17 sailors			0
even now , the @entity23 is continuing to provide training , weapons and intelligence to the @entity4 forces			0
but if president @entity56 decides to strike back in retaliation for the botched attack on the @entity148 flight , there will be a target list for him to approve			0
@entity72 , @entity0 , the @entity150			0
( @entity151 ) is this legit ? @entity152 , @entity13 : is this legit ? about a third of the world 's population is @entity156			1
legit ! according to the @entity23 government , approximately 33 percent of the global population is @entity156 , making @entity162 the world 's largest religion			1
christmas celebrated @entity21 : and of course , @entity156 around the world celebrated @entity164 on december 25th , marking the birth of @entity166			1
one of those celebrations , which you see right here , was held in the city of @entity171 , the site where @entity166 was born			0
worshippers gathered at the @entity173 for a ceremony there			0
and at the @entity177 , pope @entity176 led the traditional @entity178 there was a disruption at the beginning , though , when a woman ran toward the pope and knocked him down			0
the religious leader was n't hurt			0
he was helped up and continued with the ceremony , while @entity187 guards removed the woman			0
@entity189 @entity21 : a holy day in @entity5 marked by violence as protesters clashed with police forces about a week ago			0
demonstrators have spoken out against the country 's government for months now , but the clashes on the @entity199 holy day of @entity200 were the worst so far			1
at least seven people killed in the violence , though protesters and security forces disagree on how those deaths happened			1
meantime , @entity5 's government says it 's getting ready to hold a " large - scale military exercise " next month			1
the country says the goal is to prepare its forces to fight against an attack by the nation 's enemies			1
there 's been a lot of tension based around @entity5 's nuclear program			1
the country says the program is for peaceful purposes			0
other countries , including the @entity23 , believe @entity5 might be trying to build nuclear weapons			0
health care debate @entity21 : members of the @entity225 and @entity226 will be meeting this month to put together a final health care reform bill			0
the @entity225 passed its version on christmas eve			0
the @entity226 had already passed its bill			0
but there are some pretty big differences between the two			0
one of them : cost			0
the @entity225 bill checks in at $ 871 billion			0
the @entity226 version : over $ 1 trillion			0
another issue : the so - called public option , a government - run health insurance program			0
@entity226 bill includes it ; @entity225 bill does n't			0
so , some compromises need to be made to come up with a final bill			0
and since that then has to be approved by both houses of @entity246 , there are some concerns about whether it will pass			1
@entity249 @entity250 , @entity13 : here 's the deal : today 's @entity249 is depression			1
it describes an extreme decline in economic activity , and it is much worse than a recession			1
put that in your word bank ! @entity259 2010 @entity21 : the @entity23 avoided slipping into a depression during the recent financial crisis , but it did end up in a recession			0
you know it ; you heard about it all last semester			0
now , when that economic decline started in december 2007 , the number of @entity23 who were out of a job was around 5 percent			1
by last november , that number had doubled			0
@entity273 examines what might lie ahead in 2010			0
( begin video ) @entity276 , @entity0 correspondent : @entity277			0
more than 15 million people in the country are unemployed ; many of them lost their jobs in 2009			0
what 's ahead for 2010 ? @entity284 , who spoke to us late last year about her career hopes after sending out dozens of resumes and searching for a job , she suddenly realized what she wanted to do in life			1
@entity291 , searching for a job : luckily , out of all of this and something really positive that has come out of it is that i 've discovered that i want to become a teacher			1
and i think i would have never discovered that out of , you know , this entire year of looking for a job			1
that instead of having a job physically handed to me , i 've really had to fight for it and kind of , you know , discovered where i belong in the world			1
pilgrim : as the unemployed site - surf and soul search , there is some glimmer of hope			0
the last report in december found that new claims for unemployment benefits fell sharply , down by 22,000			0
that was the lowest level since july 2008			0
and the four - week average of people who filed for benefits has been declining for 17 weeks straight			0
@entity23 president @entity56 : we are in a very different place today than we were one year ago			1
we may forget , but we 're in a very different place			0
we can safely say that we are no longer facing the potential collapse of our financial system and we 've avoided the depression many feared			1
our economy is growing for the first time in a year			0
pilgrim : next week will also provide a good snapshot of how manufacturing and service sectors held up in december			0
as the economy gradually recovers from the worst recession since the @entity334 , going from cutting jobs to creating them is a slow adjustment			0
businesses are likely to be cautious , fully convinced in recovery before adding any new hires			1
@entity341 , @entity23 @entity343 chief economist : we 're out of the recession everywhere , but we 're not growing enough on @entity346 to put people back to work			0
when the average person thinks of a recession , they do n't think of it like economists do , you know , zero gdp growth or whatever			1
they think of it as , you know , " am i losing my job ? am i getting a raise ? " pilgrim : @entity273 , @entity0			1

@entity389 , @entity390 is over the moon about its @entity393 celebration			0
the tasty tradition : to ring in the @entity365 by watching the moon rise			0
and a traditional ball drop in @entity397 , @entity398			0
okay , maybe letting students drop 11,000 rubber balls is n't exactly a traditional @entity365 's			1
goodbye @entity21 : but it sure starts 2010 with a little bounce in their step			0
ah , @entity365 's puns			1
they all deserve one chorus of @entity407			0
