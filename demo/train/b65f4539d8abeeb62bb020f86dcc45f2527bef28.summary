@entity0 , @entity1 -- the world may soon know for sure where @entity1 poet and playwright @entity4 rests after fascists executed him in 1936 during @entity1 's @entity7			1

officials in southern @entity1 friday cleared the last legal hurdle to permit exhuming a mass grave site in a village near @entity16 where @entity4 and some other @entity7 victims are thought to be buried , @entity2 partner station @entity2 + reported			1
the area has been fenced off for weeks as scientists conducted preparatory work			0
next monday ( october 19 ) they are due to erect a large tent over the site so that exhumation can be conducted confidentially , said @entity27 regional government justice councilor @entity26 , @entity2 + reported from @entity16			0
the potential exhumation of @entity4 is part of a broader effort in @entity1 that already has resulted in various mass graves being dug up and could lead to thousands of other @entity1 still thought to be in mass graves			1
many were killed by right - wing forces loyal to @entity35 , who won the three - year long @entity7 , which began in 1936			2
@entity35 went on to rule @entity1 with an iron fist until his death in 1975			2
for years , @entity4 descendants have argued that @entity4 -- whose poems and plays are widely studied at universities , including his " poet in @entity43 " -- should not be exhumed , mainly so that he would not be seen as more important than the many other @entity7 victims thought to be in nearby mass graves			1
in a statement earlier this month , @entity4 descendants noted the complexity of the issue , because relatives of some others thought to be in the gravesite have requested their removal , identification , and permission to bury their remains in hometown cemeteries			0
in their october 2 statement , six @entity4 descendants reiterated their request that @entity4 's presumed remains not be disturbed			0
but they also reserved the right to have them identified in the future , and they asked authorities to designate the current mass grave site as a legally defined resting place			1
it is already a park , in the village of @entity70 , because that 's where it 's long been thought that @entity4 , captured by @entity35 loyalists early in the @entity7 , was shot dead , according to historians who interviewed witnesses and local villagers			1
relatives of a bullfighter , @entity81 , a tax inspector , @entity83 and a restaurant owner , @entity84 , have asked authorities to identify their remains , officials said			0
but in the case of teacher @entity90 , also executed and thought to be in the mass grave , two of his nieces are at odds over whether to exhume him or not , so officials will not act until that family reaches a common position , @entity2 + reported			1
@entity97 author @entity96 , who is a leading scholar on @entity4 , told @entity2 last year , " @entity4 is the most famous victim of the @entity7			0
i think @entity4 can be a symbol for reconciliation of the @entity7			0
" @entity1 parliament in 2007 , led by the @entity101 government , passed a law condemning @entity35 's dictatorship and calling on town halls to fund initiatives to unearth mass graves			1
it also sought to honor @entity110 clergy and others executed by the losing side in the war , the forces loyal to the leftist @entity116 government			0
since then , some prominent statutes of @entity35 have been removed from public view , but others remain , along with numerous streets in @entity1 named for @entity35 or his top generals			2
more recently , there have been efforts to try to exhume presumed @entity35 victims from a mass grave at his large mausoleum site , the @entity127 , just outside of @entity0 , where @entity35 himself is buried .			2
