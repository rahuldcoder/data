-- in " @entity2 , " best - selling author @entity1 uncovers the trouble behind truffles			1
before you crack open the pages of @entity1 's new novel , make sure and pour yourself a glass of red wine			1
better have some cheese with a baguette close at hand too , because this book is deliciously good			0
the title , " @entity2 " refers to @entity16 's highly - prized truffles of the same name			1
they 're knobby , round , roughly the size of a golf ball and so sought - after that a pound will cost you several thousand dollars			2
set in the south of @entity16 , specifically the @entity27 region , this is @entity1 's third mystery featuring @entity28 , chief of police in the sleepy town of @entity30			1
this time out , chief @entity28 must investigate a price - fixing scandal involving the international multimillion - dollar truffle market			1
there 's a murder -- two of them , in fact -- arson and a conspiracy , @entity41 thugs and some unsavory secrets from @entity16 's colonial past			1
while the plot is a page - turner , the real allure of this novel lies with the author 's other ingredients : the rich @entity16 food , the historical detail of the picturesque region and the eccentric cast of characters , including a truffle - hunting basset hound named @entity56			1
it 's an enticing mix of the savory and suspenseful , a recipe for a great read			1
besides his career as a novelist , @entity1 is also a senior director of the @entity64 , a private think - tank based in @entity66 , he is a historian , an award - winning journalist and editor emeritus at @entity70			1
@entity0 spoke to him recently from his home in @entity16			1
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : for new readers , tell me more about @entity28 and how he became the hero of your series ? @entity1 : when we bought a holiday home in the @entity27 region of @entity16 , i joined the local tennis club and met a wonderful man , our village policeman , who became my tennis partner , my good friend and my guide and teacher on @entity16 cooking , hunting , how to train dogs , make jam and enjoy the splendidly relaxed and convivial way of life			1
he 's a man who understands the difference between the law and justice and he keeps the peace in an admirably low - key way			1
he spends his mornings teaching the local children to play rugby in winter and tennis in summer			0
we have no crime , because all the kids grew up knowing him and would hate to disappoint him			0
he struck me as a marvelous character for a novel , and then as a reporter i was covering the 2005 riots in @entity107 when young immigrants began torching cars by the thousand , and i knew i wanted to write about @entity111 's big challenge of adapting to large - scale immigration and about the way the modern world and globalization impacts a small , traditional community like mine			1
and so i had my theme , my plot and my hero			0
@entity0 : your new book focuses on the multimillion - dollar truffle trade			2
tell me more about this big business			0
@entity1 : truffles are at the heart of classic @entity16 cuisine			1
they are the emperor of mushrooms , with a strange power to perfume and flavor and enhance a dish , from meat and eggs and cheese to a dessert like @entity137			0
the truffles of @entity27 , the famous @entity139 , are the most renowned and along with the white truffles of @entity141 are the most expensive , selling for over $ 2,000 a kilo for the finest quality			2
in a good year , the @entity27 will produce over 50 tons , which adds up to a $ 100 million industry			0
in recent years , fraud has crept into the market , in the form of cheap @entity149 truffles , which is part of my story			2
and most @entity27 truffles are found the traditional way , by trained dogs searching and digging in the woods			2
these ' wild ' truffles are incomparably better than the farmed variety people are trying to produce in plantations			2
favored locations for truffles are a closely guarded family secret , and we even had one recent case of a truffle hunter shooting at someone trespassing on ' his ' favorite spot			0
@entity0 : your books are filled with mouth - watering details on @entity16 food and wine			1
like @entity28 , are you also a master chef and wine connoisseur ? @entity1 : a strange thing about the wonderful food of @entity27 , with its ducks and venison , its foie gras and truffles and fine wines , is that it turns out to be a healthy diet			1
people in @entity27 have the lowest rate of heart disease in @entity16 , but it can be tough on the waistline			2
luckily it 's an outdoor life with lots of sport and exercise , and lots of walking in the woods to find truffles and hunting for venison and wild boar and game birds like the becasse			2
i love to cook , but i 'm not in the same class as my wife or @entity200 , my policeman friend			0
it 's a wonderful hobby because i 'm always learning and it gives friends and family so much pleasure			0
it made me start my own vegetable and herb garden and now i 've even started keeping chickens to produce my own eggs with glorious golden yellow yolks			0
i call my cockerel @entity214 , after the @entity16 president ( @entity214 ) , and all the hens are named after women politicians			2
so far , @entity218 lays the most eggs , @entity220 is the bully who gets to the food first , @entity217 will eat anything and @entity225 is the pretty one			0
wine is one of the great pleasures of life , and between the great wines of @entity231 and the much cheaper ( but very good ) wines of the @entity233 i 'm spoiled for choice			0
increasingly i buy wines direct from vineyards that i know and visit , often buying en primeur , which means i buy it this year and collect it next year or the year after it has matured in the barrel			0
my friends and neighbors all have their favorites , and we swap wines and drink together and compare notes over a good meal , and often it 's not the most expensive wines that give the most pleasure , but a wine that somehow perfectly matches the food , the mood and the company			0
@entity0 : your books paint an idyllic picture of life in the @entity16 countryside , how would you describe it ? @entity1 : we know that human beings have lived in the valley of the @entity262 , which is my home , for over 40,000 years			1
this is the centre of pre-history and the great cave paintings of @entity267 are just up the road			0
the @entity269 built a town near here and the invading @entity273 armies in the eighth century crossed the river near my house on their way to their historic defeat at the @entity278 , when the @entity280 army saved @entity111 for @entity281			0
the valley is filled with castles from the @entity284 , with chateaus from the centuries of @entity16 elegance , and it was also an important battleground between the @entity16 resistance and the @entity291 occupation in @entity292 i love this sense of living history , and try to bring it into my books			2
it 's a key part of the unique charm of the @entity27 , and along with its food and wines , its warm and gentle climate , its enchanting landscape and lovely old stone buildings and friendly people , it adds up to a little corner of paradise and i love it dearly			0
so if my books are not just crime novels , but also a little bit travel books and a little bit cookery books and a little bit history , they are also in a way love read some of chief @entity28 's favorite recipes on @entity1 's website .			1
