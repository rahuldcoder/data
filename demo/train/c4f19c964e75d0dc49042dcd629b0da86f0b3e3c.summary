@entity0 -- @entity2 sought out help three times			1
finally , one week after first seeing a doctor , @entity5 found out why she felt so sick : she had @entity7			2
even after her @entity7 test came back positive at @entity0 's @entity10 hospital , @entity5 had to wait			1
according to a worker at that hospital , @entity5 lay in the emergency room -- exposed to other patients as well as medical staff , going back and forth -- for eight hours before being transferred to a hospital in the @entity18 capital that specializes in infectious diseases			1
while @entity5 was " doing better " wednesday , according to a regional health spokesman said wednesday , parts of @entity18 's medical establishment is looking worse and worse the more that comes out about what she 's gone through from how she contracted @entity7 to how her case has been handled			1
her plight can also be compared to that of @entity29 , the @entity30 citizen who was sent home from a @entity34 , @entity33 , hospital days before eventually being admitted for @entity7			1
@entity29 , the first person diagnosed with @entity7 in the @entity35 , died on wednesday			2
speaking about what 's unfolding in @entity0 , health minister @entity36 told @entity38 that @entity18 is going to revise its protocols for handling @entity7			1
prime minister @entity40 also said that his country is " facing a matter that is of international concern			0
" but that does n't mean @entity18 should hunker down or become overly alarmed , urging them to " keep calm			0
" " i would like to ask you to allow the health workers to work , " he said			0
" the @entity18 health system is one of the best in the world			0

deadliest @entity7 outbreak : what you need to know until @entity5			2
she is the first person to contract the deadly virus outside @entity53			0
dr. @entity64 , who is among those treating her , said the nurse 's assistant at @entity0 's @entity70 hospital may have been exposed while removing protective gear she 'd donned to treat a @entity18 missionary infected with @entity7 in @entity53			1
" that 's what we were working on -- on the errors possibly made while removing the protective suit , " @entity64 told reporters , saying it 's possible the protective suit or gloves may have touched her face			0
angry doctors and nurses outside @entity86 said tuesday they were outraged that two missionaries -- @entity88 and @entity89 , were almost dead when they arrived -- had been brought to the hospital			0
both priests ended up dying at the @entity0 hospital			2
how did @entity18 nurse catch @entity7 ? that @entity5 may have gotten @entity7 while doing her job is a major cause of concern , especially if she did -- as she told @entity18 newspaper @entity97 -- follow the necessary protocols while caring for the missionary			1
so , too , is how her treatment was handled afterward .			0
