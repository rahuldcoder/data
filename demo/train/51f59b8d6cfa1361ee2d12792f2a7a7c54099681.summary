-- the images still inspire			2
children sitting on their parents ' shoulders amid a sea of @entity7 flags , fluttering on a cool @entity8 night			2
a young black woman running to get as close as possible to the stage			0
on november 4 , 2008 , @entity11 absorbed the world 's focus : @entity14 was elected president of the @entity7			1
his victory speech stopped the @entity17 from spinning , if only for an evening , and drew the world 's attention to an @entity7 where anything was again possible			1
@entity14 's victory energized a pulsing crowd of a hundred - thousand , their dream deferred no longer			1
journalist @entity25 called it " a great big huge happy evening " that would perhaps " wipe the memory " of a more divided @entity7 away			0
still , the podium was wrapped in bulletproof glass			0
@entity8 charged all its 13,500 police officers with protecting @entity7 's great hope			1
it sent firefighters home wearing their uniforms so they would be ready to respond			0
we were not sure the promise and possibility of that moment was shared by every @entity7			1
yet that clear night , we celebrated the peaceful transition of power and the dawn of a different day			0
this is a good country , full of good and great people , dedicated to an extraordinary @entity7 promise , our commitment to equal opportunity for everyone			2
that evening , even the most hardened partisan hearts could feel it			0
our country had taken a step forward in racial relations , a big step , something that spoke of what our nation might yet become			0
a good nation had become an even better one , where the scars of some old wounds had healed and the pain of intense divisions , though not forgotten , had receded farther into memory			0
now the world is stopped no longer			0
how did we get from that @entity7 to this ? @entity67			0
the failures for which @entity14 will be remembered are not just those of one man or one administration			1
they are the failures of an old idea , that big , old , dumb , top - down , factory style government can manage the complexities of modern times			1
the institutions of the past had their day but ca n't keep up with the hyper - connected , adaptive society we see emerging			1
the attorney general says his department 's secret acquisition of reporters ' phone records is a " matter about which i know nothing			2
" the then - secretary of state testifies she did n't know about and never reviewed specific security requests from those under her care in @entity67			1
our president learns about " outrageous " acts admitted by the @entity68 under his watch from the news media			2
these days , everyone takes responsibility but no one is actually responsible			0
" part of being president is there 's so much beneath you that you ca n't know because the government is so vast , " he told @entity106			1
so making it bigger and more expansive can only amplify its failures			0
this is the best @entity116 can do , not the worst			0
however , older industrial - age government is what president @entity14 insists upon			1
his administration still wants to control health care , retirement , the economy and almost everything else top - down , politically and artificially from distant palaces of marble			1
they want to run @entity7 from a bureaucracy so vast , its actions ca n't be known , even by those responsible for them			1
yet the failure of @entity14 's old ideas about governing may not be the most disappointing element of his legacy			1
unable to accept the constant and consistent failure of " progressive government , " some of the president 's defenders have already been reduced to saying that the attacks on @entity14 are unjust , launched against him , not on their merits , but because of his race			1
@entity143 of @entity106 could find no better way to rationalize the loss of his well known " tingle " than to explain that the country that just elected @entity14 a second time is inimical to his color			1
@entity143 explained the dimming of @entity14 's halo like this : " the problem is there are people in this country ... who want this president to have an asterisk next to his name in the history books			1
... they ca n't stand the idea that he 's president and a piece of it is racism			1
" @entity143 continued , " it is the sense that the white race must rule			2
that 's what racism is			2
and they ca n't stand the idea that a man who is not white is president			1
that sense of racial superiority and rule is in the hearts of some people in this country , not all conservatives , not even all right wingers			0
... and a big part of it is bought into by people like @entity187			0
" back we go to the day when old wounds were open and divisions among @entity7 were fresh			0
no , mr. @entity143 , racism is not the problem here			2
this president can and is being judged on the measure of his actions			2
he is being judged on the content of his character , not the color of his skin			0
we 've reached a good place in @entity7			0
we have our first black president			2
have we reached the place where we can have our first bad black one ? @entity143 ' hysteria is evidence we are not there yet			0
these next few months , republicans , @entity206 and the news media must conduct themselves better than this			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			1

@entity211 says the promise of @entity14 's election as president has *evaporated*
he says the scandals , *controversies* *reflect* a *sprawling* government that is out of control
@entity211 : some defenders detect an element of race in president 's troubles
he says problem is " top - down , factory style government " that ca n't manage today 's complexities
