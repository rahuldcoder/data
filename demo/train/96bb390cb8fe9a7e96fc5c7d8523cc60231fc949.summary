@entity0 -- president @entity2 announced new @entity4 sanctions targeting @entity6 's oil tuesday as well as banks in @entity8 and @entity9 , warning that @entity10 faces " growing consequences " for refusing to answer international questions about its nuclear program			1
@entity2 said @entity8 's @entity16 and the @entity17 in @entity9 " facilitated transactions worth millions of dollars " for @entity6 banks already under sanctions			1
" by cutting off these financial institutions from the @entity4 , today 's action makes it clear that we will expose any financial institution , no matter where they are located , that allows the increasingly desperate @entity6 regime to retain access to the international financial system , " @entity2 said in a statement issued by the @entity21			1
on a conference call with reporters tuesday , @entity33 , deputy national security adviser for strategic communications , said the purpose of additional sanctions was to " affect @entity6 's calculus " to get @entity10 to negotiate seriously over its disputed nuclear program			2
the @entity4 will continue to " look for ways to increase the impact " of sanctions on @entity6 , @entity33 said			1
" it 's only going to get worse for the @entity6 government , " he said			0
opinion : @entity47 on @entity6 is just like @entity2 the sanctions announced tuesday come on the heels of a complete @entity51 embargo on the purchase of @entity6 petroleum that took effect at the beginning of the month , and the imposition of @entity4 sanctions that cut off the @entity4 financial system from any entity that facilitates the purchase of @entity6 oil through the @entity62			1
the @entity4 recently granted exceptions to those sanctions to all major importers of @entity6 oil based on evidence that those countries had significantly reduced their purchase of @entity6 petroleum			1
countries granted exceptions must demonstrate every 180 days their continued reduction of such purchases in order to avoid @entity4 sanctions			0
the @entity73 has said that exports of @entity6 oil have dropped from a rate of 2.5 million barrels a day in 2011 to below 1.5 million barrels a day in june			0
on the same call tuesday , @entity76 , special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control at the @entity79 , said the drop represented a decline of 40 % to 50 % , and approximately $ 9 billion per quarter in lost revenue for @entity6			0
the value of @entity6 's currency , the rial , has also dropped some 38 % in value since international sanctions began to take effect the @entity2 administration said			1
in tuesday 's action , @entity2 issued an executive order against @entity6 energy and petrochemical sectors in an effort to prevent the establishment of payment mechanisms that would allow the circumvention of existing sanctions			1
in addition to formal transactions of @entity6 oil conducted through banks and other financial institutions , the new sanctions seek to punish purchases done through informal means or barter that have sought to go around existing sanctions targeting transactions through @entity6 's @entity62			2
the executive order also broadens @entity4 sanctions on any person or entity engaged in the purchase or acquisition from @entity6 's petrochemical industry , its second largest export industry behind oil			1
the petrochemical industry itself generates approximately $ 9 billion a year in foreign revenue for the @entity6 government			0
the executive order also authorizes the @entity122 to take actions that prevent @entity6 from getting access to @entity4 dollars and precious metals , such as gold , in an effort to arrest the decline of its currency			2
" these and other provisions send a clear signal to @entity6 that the @entity2 administration is determined to increase the pressure until @entity6 leaders negotiate seriously " over their nuclear program with the @entity4 and its international partners , @entity76 said on the call			1
in announcing the action against the two banks , the @entity122 said the sanctions were part of a wider effort to expose and isolate @entity6 financial institutions connected to @entity6 's support for terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction			2
" imposing sanctions on @entity152 and @entity153 underscores @entity122 's commitment to use all the tools at its disposal to intensify financial pressure against @entity6 while protecting the @entity4 financial system from illicit activity , " @entity161 @entity160 said in a written statement			1
" any bank , anywhere , that seeks to provide a financial lifeline to @entity6 's designated financial institutions should know that it will be held accountable and its activity will be exposed			0
" on the call with reporters , @entity160 said the " collateral benefit " of the sanctions is that @entity6 is finding it increasingly difficult to make payments in the international financial system , which in turn make it more difficult to procure materials for the nuclear program			2
the sanctions on @entity152 and @entity153 would have a " chilling effect " on the willingness of other international financial institutions from doing business with @entity6 banks @entity160 said			2
@entity182 : @entity6 in ' open war ' with @entity184 tuesday 's actions from the administration come at the same time that negotiators in the @entity21 and @entity188 reached an agreement on even greater sanctions on @entity6 's energy and financial sectors			0
it is possible both chambers could vote on the measures later this week before the august recess			0
@entity33 told reporters the administration is reviewing the text of the legislation , but was " quite optimistic " the administration would " continue to work in lock step with @entity201 " on sanctions with @entity6			0
moments after the adminsitration made its announcement , an influential member of @entity201 made clear there was still work ahead			0
" this legislation and today 's executive action are important steps in the right direction , but not the final word on @entity6 sanctions , " rep. @entity208 , @entity209 , the ranking member of the @entity210 said in a written statement			0
" unless @entity6 agrees to end its weapons program , we must continue to pursue even tougher measures that would result in crippling sanctions on the @entity6 regime			0
" in tuesday 's statement , @entity2 said @entity0 " remains committed to a diplomatic solution , but the onus is on @entity6 to abide by its international obligations			1
" " if the @entity6 government continues its defiance , there should be no doubt that the @entity4 and our partners will continue to impose increasing consequences , " he said			2
@entity1 's @entity232 contributed to this report .			0
