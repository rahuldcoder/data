-- hold onto your foam fingers , football fans			0
there 's a new league in town , and it 's all about fast and furious fitness			1
combining weightlifting , bodyweight movements , gymnastics and more , the @entity9 has drafted some of the most able - bodied athletes in the world , split them into eight teams , and is letting their strength , strategy and collective badass - ness determine the score			1
the best part : grid does n't discriminate			1
men and women compete against and alongside each other , players over 40 are integral to the mix , and all - around athletes and specialists can each make a difference when it counts			2
so how does the team sport plan to change the face of fitness ? @entity1 went grid - side as the @entity34 faced off against the @entity36 reign to witness the action at the first match of the inaugural 2014 season			1
@entity1 : 5 beginner - friendly @entity41 workouts welcome to the big leagues : how @entity43 started sure , the idea of team functional fitness is n't exactly new			1
if the @entity47 come to mind when watching grid athletes clean , jerk and kip at lightning speeds , it 's no coincidence			2
the league 's founder and commissioner is @entity56 , a 10 - year @entity41 executive who left the mega-brand to create a true co-ed spectator sport with greater mass appeal			1
@entity1 : how fit are you , really ? taking cues from the @entity62 and @entity63 , in april 2014 , @entity56 kicked things off with a football-esque @entity65 ( athletes were selected via invite and application ) , which put hopefuls through every imaginable fitness test , from squats to handstand walks			1
@entity73 came a traditional style draft in july , where coaches from the eight squads selected the best men and women for their rosters â € ” factoring in not just their combine performance and fitness resume , but also personality and overall " fit " for the team			0
once the teams were stacked , players were off to team training camp ( albeit some no more than a week long ) , followed by pre-season scrimmages to get familiar with the ins and outs of league play , because no , it 's not exactly intuitive			2
unlocking the grid : how it works the action takes place on a 94 - by - 50 - foot grid , split up into eight quadrants ( four for each team ) plus a start and finish area			1
every team roster must consist of 20 athletes -- 10 men and 10 women , and on game day , only five men and five women are selected to start the match ( including one 40 - plus athlete of each gender )			1
if anything goes wrong , injury or otherwise , three athletes are on standby on each team 's bench			0
the two - hour match pits two teams against one another in 11 different races that progress across the grid			1
races -- some of which are coed , some of which are male or female - only -- can include anything from handstand push - ups , burpee box jumps , rope climbs and double - unders for time			1
then there 's the " clean ladder , " where athletes must lift progressively heavier loads as they move down the grid ( topping the scales at 340 pounds ! ) , with the weight of each player 's lifts added together for a combined team score			2
for each battle , the winning team gets two points ( exception being the last race which counts for three points ) , and the losing team gets one			0
if the squad does n't complete the challenge , they walk away with zero points for that race			0
when all is said and done , the team with the highest number of points at the end of the match gets the w. of course , it 's not just about brute strength and top - end speeds			1
there 's plenty of strategy involved : players can tag in and out to keep pace during each race or if they 're incapable of completing one more rep. @entity171 do n't consider a minute on the sidelines much of a break			0
" when you 're competing as an individual you can find your own pace and if you mess up , you have a longer time to make up for it , " says @entity174 , captain of the @entity175			0
" but on the grid , everything is so fast and high - intensity that you need to move fast while you 're out there			1
if you start slowing down , it 's time to rotate and change out			0
you need to be moving full speed , all the time			0
" @entity34 co-captain @entity186 , who also earned second place at the 2014 @entity47 , says the relentless speed is something grid athletes , himself included , will need to adjust to			1
" it 's just all - out until the tank is empty			2
i have never done 20 burpees over a box that fast ... " @entity186 says of the 9th race , one of the more challenging from his first match			2
" when i hit that finish line -- i usually try to stay standing -- but i just flopped down			0
" it 's this high - octane format that brought spectators to their feet in the last few seconds of each battle at @entity207			2
it 's also what might just hold the attention of fans for seasons to come , says @entity34 coach @entity213			0
according to @entity56 , there 's plenty of potential for the players , too , stating that one of the many goals with this new league is to make functional fitness something the best in the world can finally make a living at			1
" the icing on the cake is that my parents competed at @entity207 when they were athletes , " said @entity186 , whose parents were professional pairs figure skaters			0
faster together : the road ahead in this abbreviated first season , teams will play three matches each , giving fans 12 live events total ( and ideally adequate time for the league to work out any remaining kinks )			2
in 2015 , teams are slated to play 12 matches apiece ; in 2016 and beyond : 16 matches			0
playoffs will commence in september , and will culminate in the @entity244 in @entity245 , to be aired on @entity246 on october 3			0
the ultimate prize : the @entity248 ( and a coveted place in grid history )			1
until then , fans can watch regular season match - ups on @entity253 via web broadcast			1
or , check out the 2014 schedule to find an event near you			0
for 2015 , expect eight more teams to join the league , including the @entity260 and others to be announced later this year			0
prefer to get in on the action yourself ? there 's always next year 's @entity65			0
start practicing those cleans today !			0
