following the @entity1 prisoner swap that led to the release of @entity4 sgt. @entity3 , sen. @entity5 , @entity6 , told @entity7 that 30 % of the detainees released from the @entity11 detention facility at @entity12 " have already gone back into the fight			1
" it 's a figure that has been frequently repeated in recent days , but is it true ? it depends on who is doing the counting			0
according to the @entity11 @entity19 , which regularly releases an unclassified summary report about former detainees , as of january this year , 104 of the 614 detainees ( 17 % ) released from the prison have engaged in " terrorist activities , " while another 74 ( 12 % ) are suspected of doing so			1
it is impossible to assess the validity of the @entity11 government 's claim , referenced by @entity5 , that nearly 30 % of the released detainees are confirmed or suspected of engaging in terrorist activity because the government has not publicly released the names of any of these detainees for the past five years			1
the @entity11 government defines a " confirmed " terrorist or insurgent as based on a " preponderance " of information pointing to that conclusion , while someone in the " suspected " category is based on plausible but unverified or single source reporting to that effect			2
in order to shed some light on exactly which graduates from @entity12 have joined a militant group or engaged in some other kind of terrorist activity , the @entity43 analyzed @entity52 reports , news stories , and other publicly available documents to create a list of former detainees who have " returned to the battlefield			1
" the list can be found here			0
@entity60 list documents a much smaller number than does the @entity11 government			2
of the 620 former detainees who have been transferred from the prison camp , we have identified 15 former @entity12 detainees ( 2.5 % ) who are confirmed to have engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities against the @entity11 or its citizens , while there are 21 individuals ( 3.5 % ) who are suspected of engaging in such activities			1
we also identified 18 former detainees ( 3 % ) who are confirmed or suspected of involvement in militant attacks against non- @entity11 targets			1
taking all three categories together , the @entity76 list finds only a third as many @entity12 prisoners have returned to the battlefield , compared to the @entity11 government estimate			1
a recent example of this is @entity85 citizen @entity84 , a former @entity12 prisoner released in 2005 , who was arrested in december on terrorism charges related to the @entity88 civil war			1
he has denied the charges			0
it 's important to note that the vast majority of individuals who are confirmed or suspected to have militant groups were released under the @entity95 administration , a fact that is missing from much of the current commentary			1
for the purposes of our study , for a former detainee to be considered " confirmed " that he had joined a militant group , there had to be a preponderance of information claiming he was directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities			0
for those " suspected " of such acts , there were plausible but unverified accounts about their involvement in such activities			0
while it is certainly possible there are some former detainees participating in terrorist and insurgent activities who have not been identified publicly , we are confident that our numbers are reasonably accurate because groups like @entity122 and the @entity1 are eager to trumpet the identities of released @entity12 detainees who join their ranks , as it is a propaganda coup for them , and the media is also quick to highlight such stories			1
based on our findings , even if you combine all of the released detainees who are confirmed or suspected of taking part in any form of militant activity anywhere in the world , the total comes to 54 , or 8.7 % , which is much lower than the 30 % being cited by the @entity11 intelligence community and members of @entity142			1
this percentage is also much lower than the recidivism rate of criminals within the @entity11 , which currently stands around 67.5 % , according to the most recent statistics by the @entity147			2
some of the @entity12 prisoners who were released by the @entity95 administration are certainly quite dangerous			1
@entity150 , who co-founded @entity151 ( @entity151 ) in 2009 , was transferred to @entity152 in 2007			0
@entity153 completed the kingdom 's rehabilitation program and promptly headed to @entity156 , where he became @entity151 's deputy commander			0
he was killed in a @entity11 drone strike last year			2
another example is @entity162 ( who also goes by the name @entity164 ) , who has emerged as one of the top @entity1 commanders			0
@entity162 was also transferred from @entity12 to @entity167 in 2007 by the @entity95 administration and rejoined the @entity1 shortly after the @entity167 government released him from custody			1
under @entity171 , the @entity170 and @entity52 use comprehensive threat assessments to determine a detainee 's eligibility for release			2
this has contributed to the fact that of the 88 prisoners released under @entity171 , we were only able to find publicly available information about one of those who had joined a militant group : @entity184 , who was returned to @entity167 and is accused of fighting for the @entity1 and targeting @entity167 aid workers			1
( the intelligence community claims five @entity171 - era releasees have joined militant groups			2
) of course the high - ranking @entity1 prisoners released in the exchange for sgt. @entity3 are not just low - level militants and president @entity171 himself has admitted that they might pose some future threat			2
" is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us ? absolutely			0
there 's a certain recidivism rate that takes place , " @entity171 said			0
but these men are not being released freely into @entity167 society			0
they have been transferred to the custody of @entity207 , which is a rich , efficient police state and they have been banned from travel for a year			0
assuming that ban holds , by the time they are able to travel back to @entity167 , there will no longer be any @entity11 combat presence as @entity11 combat soldiers are all pulling out at the end of december 2014			0
so any potential threat that those five @entity1 officials might pose to @entity11 targets in @entity167 will be much smaller by then .			0

@entity5 cites @entity11 statistic that 30 % of @entity12 released prisoners return to battle
@entity225 : a close study of the record finds only a third of that number are recidivists
vast majority of recidivist @entity12 detainees were freed under the @entity95 administration , he says
@entity237 : only one prisoner freed under @entity171 is known to have returned to the fight
