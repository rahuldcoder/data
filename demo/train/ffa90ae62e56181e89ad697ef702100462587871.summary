nearly 50 already - delivered @entity31 have been grounded for more than three months , after two incidents on jets operated by @entity35 airlines called the battery systems into question			1
the @entity1 's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in @entity43 and the @entity44 , where long - haul flights account for much of an airline 's business			2
@entity23 , which has six @entity1 aircraft , is the only @entity21 airline to take delivery of the @entity1 so far			2
