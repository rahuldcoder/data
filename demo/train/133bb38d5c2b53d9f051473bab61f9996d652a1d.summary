-- here 's the short , tragic story of a little car in @entity3 that nobody wanted			1
some time back in 2012 , a blue van was innocently parked along @entity6 in the village of @entity8 in @entity9			1
and it just sat there			1
the owner nowhere to be found			1
we still do n't know what happened to him			1
but we 'll just have to assume this person died or is in the middle of a really good " @entity20 " marathon			2
it 's how i lost most of my 20s			2
and a bowl of gravy			2
eventually , over the course of a year , @entity27 did her thing and the van became consumed by vines			2
amazingly , the foliage almost completely engulfed every part of the vehicle			1
and when people on the @entity38 started sharing pictures of this crazy car - bush , it sort of became a celebrity			1
not in the @entity43 kind of way			2
but in the drunk - and - naked - at - a - @entity47 @entity46 kind of way			2
" hey , who wants to see my shofar ? " " go home , rabbi			2
" so , people online started paying attention to this ever - growing mound of foliage with a funny name -- in @entity3 , vehicles that are unloved and abandoned are referred to as " jiangshiche " or " zombie cars			1
" eventually , police managed to contact the original owner of the " zombie car , " @entity65 , who explained that he had sold his blue van over three years ago but could n't recall the buyer 's name			1
so , authorities finally decided to just get rid of the damn thing			1
however , when they came to take it away , police were unable to dig the van out from beneath all the vines			0
it had simply become too thick and thorny			0
so , they just towed it off , foliage and all , hauling what appeared to be a giant bush slowly and hilariously down the highway			1
photos were taken , and , thus , this week , @entity3 's famous " zombie car " emerged once again to bask in the warm glow of the @entity38 's spotlight			1
so , that 's the short , tragic ( and completely pointless ) story of a car that nobody wanted , and the internet who loved it			1
to be honest , seeing this thing all alone kind of made me sad			0
i care about my car like a big , stupid child			1
and i only recently realized this			1
you see , the other day i was at the auto shop waiting on a minor repair -- as one does when you have no technical skills beyond heating things in the microwave			0
so , to pass time at the shop , i started thumbing through some of those hot rod magazines filled with pictures of shiny cars draped by scantily clad women			0
they had several different ones on the shelf -- lugs and @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , @entity118 -- i do n't remember the exact titles , but you get the point			0
and as i turned my attention away from those glossy pages of beautiful , perfect steel and skin , and peered through the shop 's window into the garage , my gray @entity124 suddenly seemed incredibly ... unsexy			0
you know , because it 's a @entity124			0
really , there 's nothing " suddenly " about it			0
however , almost immediately , this fact did n't matter because , hey , it was mine			0
sure , it 's big , and stupid , and gray			0
but it gets me to @entity140			0
and , for that , i think it 's worthy of a sexy photo shoot			0
" there ya go , @entity147 , get nice and close to those side - impact air bags			0
@entity150 ! " anyway , my @entity124 is awesome , and you should check it out in next month 's issue of @entity116 and @entity117			0
follow @entity153 on @entity154 .			0

in 2012 a car was abandoned in @entity3
@entity158 grew all over the car , completely *covering* it with foliage
it was a rather *absurd* sight , and the " zombie car " earned fame on the internet
recently , the car was finally towed away
