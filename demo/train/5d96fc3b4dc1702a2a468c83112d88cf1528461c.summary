president @entity1 is championing the introduction of added safety measures in motorsport following the death of @entity9 driver @entity8 in a multi-car crash on sunday			1
@entity1 , 71 , supported the idea of using a canopy to cover the open cockpits of @entity9 and @entity15 vehicles , in an attempt to prevent a recurrence of the fatal collision at the @entity19			1
the @entity20 tested the possible use of jet fighter canopies in motorsport earlier this year , by using a high - power cannon to fire at the polycarbonate shield at 225 kilometers - per - hour to see if it could withstand loose debris on a race track			2
@entity1 said a canopy could help stop accidents like the one experienced by @entity15 driver @entity31 in 2009 , when a spring fell from the @entity33 car of @entity34 and struck the @entity36 driver in the head leaving him in a coma			1
can @entity8 's death be a watershed moment ? " i think it could work , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" we get occasional incidents like the spring which hit @entity31 and the wheel which came off in @entity46 and killed @entity48 son @entity47			0
" you 're always in danger , in an open cockpit , of objects striking the driver ... it might also help , if it 's reinforced with another roll bar , in things like the @entity8 accident			2
but that 's something that needs careful investigation			0
" on the canopy test , @entity1 said it was an example of the @entity2 's continued commitment to improving driver safety			1
" it 's an example of constantly trying to find things that will reduce the probability of an accident , or an injury rather			2
accidents are always going to happen ; it 's the injuries we want to avoid			0
" former champion @entity73 calls for change despite backing the potential use of a canopy , @entity1 warned such a device could benefit the car aerodynamically and potentially cause further accidents			1
" one of the troubles is that it would probably make the car quicker , which is just what we do n't want			0
but there are other means of slowing them down			0
" there are a lot of objections to canopies , how do you keep them clean ? how do you get somebody out in an emergency ? but all of that will be looked at by a technical working group if it turns out the thing would protect the driver better			0
" @entity1 went on to back the @entity2 , expressing his confidence the organization will continue researching how to further protect racing drivers			1
" what i do know is we 've got some very clever people , looking full - time at these problems			0
all aspects , everything from the driver 's helmet , to his clothes , cockpit protection , all the different things that can save them in an accident			0
