@entity0 -- the flight attendant whose dramatic departure from a @entity7 plane at a @entity0 airport has transformed him into a folk hero to some wants his job back , his lawyer told reporters thursday			1
" that 's his life , " @entity14 's @entity13 defense attorney @entity12 told reporters outside his client 's home in @entity18 , near @entity19 , where @entity21 's exit via an emergency slide vaulted him to national attention			1
" his father was a pilot ; his mother was a flight attendant			1
that 's in his blood			2
that 's what he likes to do			2
" whether @entity21 can regain his wings was unclear			2
" we 're conducting an internal investigation regarding his status as an employee at @entity7 , " said airline spokeswoman @entity33 , who added that @entity21 has been removed from duty pending the outcome of that internal inquiry			1
she described @entity21 's behavior as unlike that of the @entity0 - based airline 's other 2,300 flight attendants			1
" i would say this is highly unique , " she said			2
but an internal memo sent thursday by @entity48 vice president and chief operating officer @entity49 and obtained by @entity1 describes a company that appears unlikely to forgive			1
" intentionally arming and deploying an evacuation slide for anything other than the express purpose of protecting the safety of our crew and customers is unacceptable , " it says			1
" it will not , and can not , be tolerated			2
" during the defense lawyer 's remarks , the 20 - year flight attendant stood at his side and smiled occasionally but made only one brief remark : " thank you all so much , " he said			1
" it 's been amazing -- the support and the love and everything that 's been brought to me and given to me by my community and my friends and the industry at large			2
it 's been absolutely wonderful			2
" the incident may not have appeared so wonderful when it began unfolding monday morning at @entity78 's @entity77 where , according to @entity7 spokeswoman @entity33 , @entity21 was one of two flight attendants aboard an @entity81 flight that was scheduled to depart at 10:35 a.m. and arrive 84 minutes later at @entity19			1
problems began before the flight , carrying a full load of 100 passengers , took off			1
" a number of passengers were competing for overhead carry - on luggage areas , " @entity12 , @entity21 's attorney , said			1
" with great difficulty , they were shoving the bags around , attempting to get it in			2
@entity92 came over to assist and either the bag or the overhead ( bin door ) hit him in the head and at that point he suffered an injury			0
" @entity12 offered a more graphic description of events on wednesday , when he said a woman " started cursing and -- based on the information -- slammed the overhead luggage bin on his head			0
" then the woman said , " f --- you " to @entity21 , @entity12 said			0
after the flight landed at @entity19 , @entity21 approached the woman as she attempted to retrieve her bag from the bin while the plane was still taxiing to the gate , according to a source familiar with the incident			1
passengers are required to stay in their seats with their seat belts fastened until the pilot has reached the gate and gives the all - clear sign			1
" we hear @entity21 on the intercom , ' will people on the aisle please sit down ? we 're on an active runway , ' " recalled passenger @entity123 , an executive with the @entity125 radio network			0
then @entity21 made a second announcement , @entity123 told @entity1			1
" please sit down and shut the overhead bin			0
we can not move this plane while you 're standing			0
" the passenger cursed @entity21 again , @entity12 said wednesday			0
her fury grew upon learning she would have to wait at baggage claim to retrieve luggage she had been forced to check at the gate in @entity77 , he said			0
at that point , @entity21 got on the plane 's public address system			0
passenger @entity140 wrote on his blog that @entity21 said , " to the passenger who just called me a motherf --- -- : f --- you			0
i 've been in this business 20 years , and i 've had it			0
" the plane was blocked into the gate at 12:07 p.m. , eight minutes late			0
after making an expletive - filled announcement , @entity21 had a confrontation with another crew member , according to passenger @entity152 of @entity153 , @entity154			1
" we see him grabbing his roller bag that all flight personnel use			1
he tossed it out the right door of the plane , " @entity152 , a semi-retired attorney , told @entity1			1
" he was scuffling with either the pilot or the co-pilot			0
i noticed a lot of blue ; there was a lot of movement in the galley area			0
" @entity21 then grabbed some beer from the beverage cart before deploying the emergency slide and leaving			1
the flight crew reported the slide deployment at 12:12 p.m. , according to @entity49 's memo			1
@entity12 sharply denied a @entity7 passenger 's assertion published thursday that the flight attendant instigated the confrontation			1
" it 's not so , " said @entity12			0
" sometimes , some people in our society are not courteous and are impatient , " @entity12 said			0
" for 20 years , @entity92 has been very patient , has dealt with the passengers in each of the airlines he worked for in an effective and courteous and polite manner			0
sometimes that point can be taken advantage of by others			0
" he added , " if you think it 's easy for flight attendants to get on a plane every day and be concerned for the safety of each and every passenger -- without a tension , without a stress -- you 're fooling yourselves			1
" @entity21 has pleaded not guilty to charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief -- both felonies -- and criminal trespass			1
if convicted , he could face a maximum of seven years in prison			0
but @entity12 said thursday he had spoken with the district attorney 's office , " and i believe there will be a favorable outcome for my client that should satisfy all parties in this case			2
" a spokeswoman for the prosecutor did not respond directly to @entity12 's remarks			0
" we will prosecute this case in the court , " said @entity217 of the district attorney 's office			2
" we 're not going to respond to every press conference the attorney gives			2
" @entity21 has a court appearance scheduled for september 7			0
meanwhile , @entity21 had amassed more than 191,000 " fans " on a public @entity227 page as of thursday evening			0
@entity1 's @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this story .			0
