-- it used to be one of the great sights in tennis -- the likes of @entity6 and @entity7 flying around the net , executing flawless volleys to follow up precision serves			0
but the fearsome hitting power of modern tennis players has destroyed an art once finessed by some of @entity16 's greatest champions , according to eight - time grand slam winner @entity17			1
@entity19 legend @entity17 believes the bold playing style -- mastered to thrilling effect on grass by legends such as @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 -- has been outdated by advances in technology and training			1
" the reason the guys do n't serve and volley is mainly because of the spin on the ball that is given by the string and also by the strength of the guys and their technique , " @entity17 told @entity0			1
" so to come to the net and be fishing for that ball when the guy takes a full swing and it has 8,000 rpm on that ball ... it becomes very , very difficult to volley and put away			0
" in the next two weeks , @entity17 is chasing the @entity16 title -- the only grand slam that eluded him as a player -- as a coach for @entity52 number one @entity53			2
but @entity17 , who is now a @entity54 citizen , appears unlikely to encourage the @entity55 to make frequent forays from the baseline			2
@entity53 relishes @entity16 's home comforts " there are only a handful of guys that can do it right now -- @entity63 ( @entity64 ) being one of them , " @entity17 said			1
but even @entity64 , whose serve - and - volley prowess helped secure six @entity16 titles , has abandoned the technique			1
@entity70 , a four - time @entity16 semifinalist and one of the few players of his generation to embrace the serve - and - volley game , thinks @entity64 has been forced to adapt his style at the @entity77 venue			1
" he used to ( serve and volley ) , but i think the conditions of the grass have changed so much -- the balls are probably heavier , the courts are much , much slower , so there is far less serve and volley , " @entity70 told @entity0			2
however , the former @entity52 number one maintains that coming to the net can pay off at @entity16 , adding : " i think you 've got to really keep attacking on grass , it 's the hardest surface to defend on			0
" lost art yet @entity91 , the most lethal exponent of serve and volley ever seen at the @entity93 , is less optimistic about the future of the technique			1
" it 's gone , " he told @entity0 earlier this year			0
" i love watching @entity63 , @entity96 , @entity97 , but it 's sad to see @entity16 today with everyone staying back , " @entity91 said in march			2
" i developed the serve and volley game at a young age			0
i started at 13 , 14 -- if you 're 20 and do n't serve and volley , it 's too late			0
" @entity91 concurs with @entity17 that the state - of - the - art equipment used by today 's players has hastened the decline of serve - volley			1
" technology might be an issue because with these big @entity112 rackets , they do n't need to volley , you just hit the crap out of the ball			0
whereas we grew up with the wood racket , so you had to hit it properly , " said the seven - time @entity16 champion			0
" it 'd be nice to have someone come up that serves and volleys			0
it 's definitely a lost art , and it 's unfortunate			0
" @entity91 would not be the only one saddened if the era of @entity64 , @entity96 and @entity97 -- so often hailed as a golden one for tennis -- also came to be defined by the erosion of one the game 's most exhilarating skills .			1

former world *no.* 1 @entity17 says serve and volley is too difficult in modern tennis
hitting power and new technologies mean players now stay at the baseline
@entity64 is finding it harder to serve and volley , says @entity70
@entity16 legend @entity91 believes the technique is a dying art
