@entity1 we might still not have jetpacks and flying cars , but another dangling promise of the technology world now seems one step closer			2
virtual reality ( @entity9 ) is a serious business , as confirmed by @entity12 's acquisition of @entity9 for $ 2 billion earlier this year			1
now , the makers of the highly anticipated @entity9 device seem on track to deliver a consumer model , which they say is " many months , " but not years , away			1
" this is the beginning of consumer virtual reality , " said @entity17 , ceo of @entity9 , referring to the company 's latest prototype , called " @entity20			1
" faster , lighter and equipped with headphones , the prototype offers the best performance to date , says @entity17 , and a convincing peek into the world of virtual reality			1
" it has very low latency , so when you 're moving around it 's not catching up with you , it 's all happening instantaneously , " @entity17 told @entity2 , from the web summit technology conference , in @entity1			1
" suddenly you get to that threshold where everything comes together , a switch in your brain flips , and you 're comfortable , you feel like you 're there			0
we call it the power of presence			0
" @entity44 describing what @entity9 feels like is a bit like explaining romance to someone who 's never been in love			1
it is a difficult task			0
going from traditional computer graphics and interactive environments -- such as those found in today 's most advanced video games -- to the virtual reality offered by @entity9 ' latest technology is like stepping into a brave new world , where the senses are completely invested rather than simply engaged			1
there is a feeling of suspension and inevitability			0
the closest equivalent that one might have experienced before is something called " the broken escalator phenomenon			0
" when you approach a broken escalator , despite being fully aware that it 's not moving , your body still relays an odd sensation of imbalance as your stride , involuntarily , tries to conform to your experience of a moving one			2
scientists have found this to be due to a " dissociation between knowledge and action " in the brain , and the process is in full swing when using the @entity9			1
you know full well that it is just a simulation , but when you are placed on top of a skyscraper , high up in the evening canopy of a rainy metropolis , your steps become uncertain and you seek the safety of a railing to hide behind			0
a pet @entity95 viewed through the @entity9 is at the same time endearing and terrifying , and a curious alien gives you the impression that you might become best friends in a matter of minutes			1
the short circuit in your senses makes the experience , well , technically real			0
it is a remarkable sensation , and probably the closest thing to lucid dreaming this side of falling asleep			0
" the next step is to bring other people in there with you			0
your friends will be there , and you 'll believe they 're there , " @entity17 told @entity2			1
the ambition is to revolutionize the way we communicate			2
" imagine a pair of virtual reality sunglasses in the future , and everybody in the world is inside , " said @entity17			1
" all you have to do is put them on and you can be face to face with anyone			0
think about the power and the impact that the telephone has had			0
the potential for this new platform is that it may be the biggest future platform of all time , maybe the final platform , because once you have virtual vision , what 's next ? it 's hard to imagine what 's next			1
" this is where @entity12 comes in			1
" if you 're gon na put on these glasses and talk to your friends , you wan na trust your friend network , you wan na make sure that those are really your friends that you 're talking to , and @entity12 provides that kind of platform , " explained @entity17			1
since the acquisition , the company has gone from about 50 employees earlier this year to about 200 , heading toward 250			2
" @entity12 has supercharged our recruiting , and these are some of the very best and brightest people in the industry that are joining us , " said @entity17			1
killer app that still does n't mean that every detail is set in stone			0
the device still has no input controls , and it 's unclear whether they will come in the form of a traditional gamepad or some other type of interface			2
but most importantly , the killer app for @entity9 is anyone 's guess			1
" we 're just learning what @entity9 is , " said @entity17 , and that 's why the company is welcoming competition			1
" it is still anybody 's game , " he said			2
" we 're excited for everybody to get involved , and we 're hoping that the likes of @entity173 and @entity174 and maybe @entity171 will one day get involved			0
they 'll probably have to , to stay relevant in the next generation of computing			0
" other possible applications include virtual tourism , real - time cinema experiences , immersive gaming and education			2
" the @entity183 has more than 130 million items			0
they could be scanned and put into a virtual reality environment and you would believe they were in front of you , " he said			1
still , @entity17 hopes that competitors will not at all costs try to beat @entity9 to the market , putting out devices with poor performance that might alienate customers and " poison the well			1
" @entity9 technology already suffered a demise back in 1995 , in what @entity9 executives define as " the nuclear winter of virtual reality			1
" motion sickness and disorientation were extreme due to the technical constraints of the time			0
but even with today 's advanced hardware , issues remain			2
" we have two perceptual psychologists on board , " @entity17 said , " and we expect that group to grow			2
all the effects you can get in real life you can now get in virtual reality , and that 's really exciting but also something you want to be careful with , to make sure that it 's not too intense an experience			1
" we want it to be something that you can enjoy for a long period of time , without too much vertigo , or too much claustrophobia			0
we need a new set of experiences that touch on the emotional side , but not too much			0
" interestingly , @entity17 wants the @entity231 to be a beautiful object ; even though the user does not see it , other people do , he says : " the more beautiful the product is , the more likely you are to buy it			2
and the more elegant it gets , the more the form factor shrinks , the sooner we get to virtual reality sunglasses			1
" the idea that one day the headset will shrink down to the size of sunglasses , much like those used today to watch @entity243 , carries an impact that goes beyond aesthetics			0
" computers and smartphones do not offer a very social experience , " said @entity17			2
" we have what i call ' cellphone zombies , ' people who are staring down at their phone for a big part of their day			0
imagine when it will be just sunglasses : we 'll get back to what we 've been doing for so many centuries , talking to each other naturally , face to face , not through some text interface			0
" the sunglasses may still be many years away , though , and a consumer model will come in a shape similar to that of the current prototype , with no firm release date yet			2
" you either get it right now , or you get it right			0
we want to err on the side of right			0

@entity9 has created a virtual reality technology , currently at the prototype stage
@entity12 bought the company in march for over $ 2 billion
@entity17 , @entity9 's ceo , says a consumer version is still " many months " away
the technology could *transform* the way we communicate , say its *creators*
