@entity0 , @entity1 -- steelmakers are known to be one of the worst polluters in manufacturing , but @entity1 's newest plant claims it is designed to go green			1
@entity9 's @entity0 plant , which sits an hour and a half south of @entity11 on the west coast , is the youngest steel plant in the world and has adopted new technologies to ensure it stand out from others			1
by simply enclosing storage and transport routes for raw material , they are able to prevent dust particles from entering the surrounding areas			1
the facility , which includes 35 kilometers ( 21 miles ) of conveyor belts fully enclosed and state - of - the - art storage domes , cost @entity9 roughly $ 5.5 billion to build			1
the two blast furnaces produce eight million tons of steel a year			0
it is no small investment , but the steelmaker believes it will earn its way back in no time			0
" with the encapsulated storage system , we minimize loss of raw material so that may be $ 20 million a year ( that we are saving ) , " said @entity9 's senior executive vice president @entity32			1
other steelmakers lose roughly 0.5 % in raw materials annually by keeping them in the open , subjecting the material to rain and wind , according to @entity9			2
the idea is simple but conventional players elsewhere see it as a large investment that would require a new layout for the steel plant			1
@entity9 's @entity0 plant , which blew in its blast furnace at the beginning of last year , was designed to accommodate the green system from the beginning			1
@entity0 also boasts its recycling byproducts emitted during the process of burning and melting raw materials			1
the company says it recycles 100 % of its byproducts which supplies 80 % of the operation energy at the plant			2
" the byproduct gas contains energy and has some value			0
for example , it contains carbon monoxide , hydrogen and methane , so the byproduct gas can be utilized for heating up furnaces in the plant , " vice president @entity32 said			0
to make sure @entity9 is meeting its standards as a green steelmaker , it monitors its emission output around the clock which is not only reported to the government but is also open to the public			2
the steelmaker keeps its pollution levels below half of the government 's regulations , according to @entity9 's technical research center manager , @entity85 - yeul			2
its tight relationship with its sister companies , @entity88 and @entity89 , is also enhancing its efforts to become more green			0
not only does @entity9 supply car parts to @entity88 , the old cars at the end of their cycle come back to the steelmaker as scrap metal to be melted down and used once again			0
the rougher steel produced from scrap metal can then be used at construction sites			0
despite these efforts , tackling co2 emissions remains an ongoing challenge			0
but the company 's dedicated task force team continue the drive towards producing environmentally - friendly energy and removing the obstacles in the way of even cleaner steel production .			0

@entity9 is reducing emissions at its steel plant in @entity0 , @entity1
facility which includes 35 kilometers of conveyor belts cost around $ 5.5 billion to build
