-- in 2007 , while serving as a @entity3 in @entity4 , my team was hit by a suicide truck bomb			1
as i made my way through the debris of our barracks , ears ringing , choking on chlorine gas , i looked down and saw blood			2
i soon realized that the blood was not mine , but was from my friend @entity14 , who had been an arm 's length from me			2
when i came home from @entity4 , i visited with @entity14 and also went to @entity18 , to meet with recently returned wounded @entity19			2
i asked each one of them , " what do you want to do when you recover ? " they all told me , " i want to go back to my unit			2
" the harsh reality , however , was that many of them were not going to return to their units			0
they had lost limbs , the function of a lung , hearing			0
so i asked them , " if you ca n't go back to your unit right away , what else would you like to do ? " one @entity19 told me that he 'd like to return to his community as a football coach and mentor			0
another @entity19 said he was considering becoming a teacher			0
still another wanted to work at @entity18 , counseling other wounded veterans			1
as i left @entity18 that day , i knew that i was part of a long line of visitors and well - wishers that would pass through those halls , thanking veterans for their military service			1
but after my conversations , i realized that these men and women needed to hear more than , " thank you			0
" they also needed to hear , " we still need you			0
" in order for their transitions back to their communities to be successful , in order to find the same purpose they felt in uniform , they needed to be challenged			1
at @entity66 , we challenge veterans to serve and inspire in communities across @entity69			1
we are creating successful transitions by engaging returning veterans in six - month fellowships at nonprofit and public service organizations in their home communities			1
during their fellowships , our veterans are provided with a stipend , mentors , and an intensive curriculum designed to achieve one of three post-fellowship goals			1
they go on to full - time employment , full - time education , or participate in an ongoing role of service in their communities			1
in our program , @entity19 veteran @entity87 returns to the same middle school he once attended , to serve as a tutor and role model for young students			1
army veteran @entity93 reconnects with her desire to serve , helping @entity96 build homes in @entity97 , @entity98			2
former @entity100 cannon crewmember @entity99 responds to 911 calls with the @entity102 , bringing assistance and comfort as part of the @entity106			0
to date , we have awarded more than 500 fellowships to post- 9/11 veterans , who have served with more than 300 organizations across the country			2
our fellows serve and they inspire			0
together we 've engaged more than 25,000 volunteers to work alongside veterans at service projects , bringing communities together in more than 40 states and the @entity117			1
our program is having an impact			0
in two independent research reports , the @entity119 at @entity120 in @entity121 has found that nearly 80 % of the participants in our program felt that serving in the community had a positive effect on their future employability , performance , and promotion , or that it instigated them to make a career change			0
in fact , 86 % of participants reported transferring their military skills to civilian employment and 100 % of @entity134 reported that they will probably or definitely stay involved in volunteer activities and public service in the future			1
our program is successful because diverse groups support our work			0
we are proud to have thousands of individuals donate their time and energy to spread awareness of our mission			0
they have volunteered at service projects and invested in our program			2
we are equally proud of the companies like @entity148 , @entity149 , and @entity150 that make financial investments to fund our fellowships , and bring their employees out to service events across the country			2
together , these groups make us stronger			0
we need their strength , because there is still much work to be done			0
with the end of the war in @entity4 , and the drawdown in @entity165 , our military is getting smaller			0
over the next year , more than a quarter million service members will transition from the military			1
in order for veterans to transition successfully , more communities across @entity69 must recognize the service they still have to give			1
we believe that when the story of this generation of veterans is written , it will not only be a story of the wars they have fought overseas , it will also be a story of the homes built , the parks restored , and the young minds engaged by veterans whose mission continues in communities here at home .			1

@entity187 is an @entity188 veteran and former @entity3 *officer*
he founded @entity66 to help veterans transition to civilian life
@entity187 : communities must recognize the service veterans still have to give
