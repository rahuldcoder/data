@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 unveiled a $ 1.5 billion border funding package wednesday to address the situation on the southern border , almost $ 1 billion dollars smaller than the version introduced by @entity8 on tuesday , and less than half of what president @entity10 requested			1
but strong opposition from congressional @entity8 to policy changes @entity3 and @entity8 @entity15 members want to attach to a bill combined with conservative pushback from those @entity2 who do n't want to give @entity10 any more money means getting anything through @entity20 is an uphill battle			1
house speaker @entity22 criticized the @entity10 administration for sending what he believes were mixed signals about its position on altering a 2008 immigration law that allows children from @entity30 to remain in the @entity31 until they have a hearing			1
immigration fast facts " the administration ought to get their act together , " @entity22 told reporters after the closed - door meeting with @entity3 republicans			1
" you know they made indications that they were for changes to the 2008 law that helped bring this problem on , and yet now they 're opposed to it			0
without trying to fix the problem , i do n't know how we actually are in a position to give the president any more money			0
" opinion : @entity15 , show you care about kids at the border @entity22 sent @entity10 a letter on wednesday pointing to recent public comments by the president and other administration officials in support of getting additional legal authority , but said that now congressional @entity8 have " backpedaled and voiced unswerving opposition to any changes at all			1
" " frankly , it is difficult to see how we can make progress on this issue without strong , public support from the @entity3 for much - needed reforms , including changes to the 2008 law , " @entity22 wrote			1
prospects for border legislation in doubt changing 2008 law at center of plan a @entity77 set up by @entity22 released a series of policy recommendations it believes are needed to stem the influx of illegal crossings			2
the centerpiece of their plan was reversing the 2008 law to make it easier to deport unaccompanied children fleeing countries like @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
instead of children being allowed to remain in the @entity31 until they receive a hearing -- something that can take months or more than a year -- most children will be returned home quickly			0
those who maintain that they face threats of sexual abuse or violence will stay in @entity31 custody and get a hearing within seven days			0
immigration crisis a political conundrum that plan mirrors a bipartisan bill introduced last week by @entity106 rep. @entity105 and @entity15 sen. @entity107 , both of @entity109			2
the working group also wants to deploy the @entity111 to the border to assist border patrol agents dealing with humanitarian needs , establish a set of metrics to measure how well federal agencies are securing the border , and expand the number of judges who can more quickly determine whether claims of persecution from those coming into the @entity31 from @entity30 are legitimate			0
many of the recommendations from the group are expected to be added to the funding proposal outlined by @entity130 chairman @entity129			0
the @entity3 plan uses left over funds from various federal programs to cover the price tag			2
@entity8 argue the emergency spending bill does n't need to be offset			1
@entity129 insisted the change to the 2008 law is a critical component of @entity20 ' response , saying , " if we do n't change the ' 08 law , the costs of dealing with the problem go up at least $ 1.3 billion that @entity138 [ @entity138 ] would need to continue to house the people that continue to flood across			0
" the witches ' brew : desperation , hope and children on the border not much support from democrats @entity8 released their border funding proposal on tuesday -- a $ 2.7 billion package that does not include any policy changes			2
but it 's unclear that proposal can pass			0
@entity3 @entity15 leaders planned to huddle after meeting with their rank and file members to discuss what details they would put in a final legislative package			2
they recognize that their pared - down package wo n't get many @entity106 votes			2
besides @entity105 , only one @entity3 @entity168 has signed onto the bill to change the 2008 law			2
@entity172 @entity171 has said she opposes it and argued any significant changes to immigration laws need to be handled separately			0
the no. 2 @entity3 @entity168 , rep. @entity176 of @entity177 , told reporters that @entity15 leaders should n't expect much support for their plan			1
@entity176 said @entity182 , a top @entity3 aide on domestic policy , told him the @entity3 is pushing for a border bill without any policy provisions attached , but the administration is open to discussing changes to the 2008 law on a separate track			0
for @entity22 getting the 218 votes needed to pass a border bill mostly with @entity3 @entity2 votes is proving to be a big lift			1
@entity2 rep. @entity2 of @entity193 told reporters he opposed giving more than $ 1 billion to the administration and instead suggested spending $ 20 - 30 million to pay for one - way plane tickets to send all of the children crossing the border back to their home countries			1
playing the blame game blasting @entity10 's handling of the crisis , an exasperated @entity2 said the administration is giving families coming from @entity30 " free goodies , free food , free clothing , free health care , free transportation , free entertainment			2
" he added , " right now the president of the @entity31 is the world 's sugar daddy and that has to stop			0
" but @entity215 @entity15 rep. @entity214 told reporters the growing problem means @entity20 should act , and he hoped something would pass before the recess			0
referring to the short amount of time left before @entity20 leaves for its august break , @entity214 said , " i think we need to deal with this issue , we ca n't let it linger another five weeks			0
" both parties acknowledge some federal agencies housing and providing medical care for the tens of thousands of children coming across the border are scheduled to run out of money next month			0
since @entity20 controls the purse strings , @entity3 @entity2 realize that if they do n't pass a bill they 'll get blamed for the situation getting worse			1
" i think if you do n't do something the administration and the @entity8 in the @entity8 are going to say -- well they 're going to try to offload this problem onto @entity2 and say it 's due to our failure to act , " @entity15 rep. @entity234 said wednesday			1
@entity22 declined to commit to holding a @entity3 vote on a @entity15 bill before the end of the month , but said " i 'd like to act , we 've got a humanitarian crisis on the border that has to be dealt with			1
" @entity109 @entity15 rep. @entity247 , a member of the border working group , warned that if the @entity3 and @entity8 failed to reach a deal on a border bill , " another 50,000 unaccompanied minors will come across our border			1

@entity3 @entity2 offer plan far less costly than @entity8 , @entity10
some in @entity15 *caucus* balk at spending any money except to send children home
number two @entity168 in @entity3 tells @entity2 not to expect much support from them
house speaker @entity22 wo n't commit to a vote before august recess
