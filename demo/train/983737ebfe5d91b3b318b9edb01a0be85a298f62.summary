-- an @entity2 panel on thursday suggested changes to the country 's @entity4 to give better recognition to the indigenous population that inhabited the vast continent long before @entity9 settled there			1
the indigenous australians -- often referred to as @entity11 and @entity12 peoples -- suffered at the hands of the settlers and the government they established			2
@entity2 politicians have since apologized for the past mistreatment , but @entity19 remain disadvantaged socially and economically compared with the overall population			2
explicit references to @entity19 in the original @entity4 , drafted in the late 19th century , were subsequently deemed to be negative			2
@entity2 voted overwhelmingly to remove those points in a 1967 referendum , but many people say the document can be further improved to acknowledge the role of the country 's indigenous population			1
the panel -- which included @entity11 leaders , business executives , legal experts and members of the main political parties -- handed over its report on thursday to prime minister @entity36 , whose government has promised to hold a referendum on the matter by the next general election			1
after spending the past year gathering opinions from people across @entity2 's huge territory , the panel faced the delicate task of proposing meaningful changes to the @entity4 that would receive support from across the political spectrum			1
without the backing of all the major political parties , the proposed measures would have little chance of success at a referendum			0
and rejection by voters could deal a blow to @entity2 's self - image			0
" for many @entity2 , the failure of a referendum on recognition of @entity11 and @entity12 peoples would result in confusion about the nation 's values , commitment to racial nondiscrimination , and sense of national identity , " the panel said in its report			1
" the negative impact on @entity11 and @entity12 peoples would be profound			0
" the challenge is highlighted by the track record of past efforts to change the @entity4 by vote : only eight of the 44 referendum proposals have passed in @entity2 's history , with the last successful one in 1974			1
the panel said it had put forward changes that it thought would be likely to secure broad - based approval from @entity2			1
it proposed repealing two provisions that are still considered to have racist connotations : one that allows states to disqualify people of " all persons of any race " from voting at elections ; and another that authorizes parliament to make " special laws " for " the people of any race			0
" that recommendation was expected and had already been supported by the government and the opposition			0
the panel also made the more politically sensitive suggestion of adding a new section that would give @entity102 the power to make laws " for the peace , order and good government ' of @entity2 " with respect to @entity11 and @entity12 peoples			1
" that section would include a passage recognizing that " the continent and its islands now known as @entity2 were first occupied by @entity11 and @entity12 peoples			0
" the report also proposed a section prohibiting racial discrimination while still allowing for the possibility of measures to protect and help " any group			0
" some politicians and commentators had expressed concern before thursday that the panel may put forward new provisions that , if enacted , would give too much power to the courts to interpret the wording as they saw fit			0
the government said in a statement that it would " carefully consider the panel 's recommendations before determining the best way forward			2

a panel proposes new sections for the @entity135 to recognize indigenous people
the government says it will consider the recommendations before deciding how to proceed
it has promised a referendum on the issue by the next election
changes to the @entity4 by referendum *rarely* do well in @entity2
