-- the @entity2 teachers strike has forced into the open a debate about school reform that has simmered for several years			1
on one side are " reformers " such as mayor @entity8 , who have been pushing for the expansion of charter schools , the use of test scores to evaluate teachers , the replacement of veteran teachers with those who are alternatively certified through programs such as @entity17 and the closure of " failing schools			1
" the mayor claims these changes will improve public education , although there 's been scant evidence to support his proposals			1
on the other side is the @entity27 , which has been clear about what it opposes : closing schools , expanding charters , for example , but less clear about what should be done to improve schools			1
on friday , both sides reached a tentative deal , but the strike is not over until union reps vote , which is expected this weekend			1
let 's be straight : @entity2 's public schools desperately need to change			1
they have some of the highest dropout rates in the nation , and many schools are chronically unsafe and ineffective			2
but the district has been undergoing reforms for several years now			0
before @entity8 , the chief architect for change was @entity50 secretary of education @entity48 , ceo of @entity51 from 2001 to 2009			2
in fact , many of the reforms now embraced by @entity8 -- expanding charter schools , replacing failing schools with new schools -- started under @entity48 ( and former mayor @entity58 )			2
the question we should be asking is : why have n't they worked ? clearly something is still not right in @entity2 given that only 44.6 % of @entity51 students meet or exceed the @entity64 ; and in 2011 - 12 of the 598 schools in the system , 443 did not achieve " adequate yearly progress " for two consecutive years ; and 523 schools had an overall rating in 2011 of " no , " indicating that they did not make @entity70			1
in an exhaustive study of many of the reforms carried out during the @entity48 years , @entity71 and his colleagues at the @entity73 found that the following elements are essential to sustained school reform : effective leadership , parent - community ties , professional capacity ( teacher effectiveness ) and a student - centered learning environment			0
they also found that in the schools where poverty was most heavily concentrated , the reforms failed to generate sustainable improvements because the schools were overwhelmed by poverty 's effect on the lives of children			1
it is important to note that the researchers did not conclude that poverty itself was a learning disability			0
rather , the study found that if the effects of poverty -- poor nutrition and health , housing instability , violence , neglect , etc. -- were not addressed , student achievement and school performance suffered			1
unlike the mayor , the teachers union has acknowledged this problem and called for more social workers and social services at high poverty schools			1
in a city where more than 80 % of school age children are poor , this is a good start but it does n't go far enough			2
struggling schools in @entity2 also need to be able to attract and retain good teachers , and the union has opposed replacing teachers at the failing schools			1
unlike the union , the mayor has emphasized the need for urgency in improving the school system since his election			0
the union must acknowledge that the system needs an effective way to evaluate teachers and an expedited process for removing those who are ineffective			0
if the union rejects using test scores as a basis for evaluation -- and the research shows that using test scores in this way is both prone to inaccuracies and could create disincentives for teachers to work with the neediest children -- then it must put forward another model that is workable			0
" @entity143 " is not an answer			0
the problems created by ineffective teachers are real and can not be ignored			0
the real losers in this strike are the children of @entity2 , and not just because they have been left out of school for a few days but because they will be forced to return to too many inadequate schools when the strike is resolved			1
@entity8 must stop his bullying tactics , and the union must put forward its own proposals for change			1
both parties must begin working together to create the schools that the children of @entity2 deserve			0
this must include comprehensive plans for addressing the effects of poverty , but it must also include plans for improving the quality of teaching and the performance of schools			2
@entity2 would do well to learn from the example of @entity169 , which also has been under mayoral control for several years and has been a leader in reform despite the presence of a strong union			0
several of its pilot schools , which function as in - district charters , are top performing schools , and it has also succeeded in turning around struggling schools such as @entity180			0
the big difference is that reforms in @entity169 have been carried out with teachers and not on them			0
today , @entity169 is also one of the top performing urban school districts in the nation , and the union just agreed to a contract that includes rigorous evaluation and uses student test scores in the formula			0
it 's amazing what can be accomplished when the adults work together in the interest of children			0
it would be a good idea if educational leaders in @entity2 spent more time working together for change and improvement and less time pointing fingers			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : whatever outcome of teachers strike , it 's clear schools need change
he says they face high dropouts , low ratings , poor student progress , high poverty
sides must deal : @entity27 must see need for good teachers ; mayor must stop bullying
@entity206 : even with deal , students will return to *substandard* schools
