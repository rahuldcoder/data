-- @entity1 is foliage season in @entity3 , but the colors that really get locals excited this time of year are blue and yellow -- for the @entity8 's football team			1
every saturday , millions of fans across the @entity11 stream into college football stadiums like @entity8 's @entity13 to chant , cheer , and stomp for the home teams			1
while winning helps , the best places to watch college football are based on more than any record			1
the stadiums must be outstanding , whether for their history or sheer size			0

there 's also a sense -- despite a few recent scandals -- that college football is much " purer " than the pro game			1
and college football is peppered with larger - than - life historic figures like coach @entity40 and running back @entity41			1
but it 's always ready for new legends			1
join the game - day crowds at one of these top stadiums for that kind of exhilarating rush -- and maybe even history in the making			0

even @entity53 's bright blue playing field -- sometimes called the " @entity53 " -- was the first non-green field in college football and remains the only alternative color in @entity71			1

@entity120 : @entity121 , @entity122 the @entity123 have n't been a top team in years , but the laid - back southern @entity122 ambience still makes the @entity120 an appealing place for college football			1

despite recent @entity76 violations and a head coach departure , @entity164 remains a national power with historic trappings : the @entity169 of trees to honor @entity172 all - americans , the victory bell that tolls after each game , and the sousaphone player dotting the " i " when the @entity164 marching band spells out the word " @entity154 " during the pregame show			0
