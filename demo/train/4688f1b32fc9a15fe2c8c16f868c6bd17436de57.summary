build it and they will come			0
that appears to have been the strategy for urban development in @entity5 over the last decade , during what has arguably been the largest and fastest urbanization of a society in modern history			1
in @entity14 , the capital of central @entity13 province , this approach has had mixed results			1
just a few years back , a new development zone , an adjunct to the main city , was labeled @entity5 's largest ghost city -- rows and rows of luxury apartments and office buildings sat empty on vast , deserted boulevards			1
but now locals here say signs of life have sprung up and the city is growing			2
on a recent national holiday , visitors flocked to a new park by the river			2
it was a remarkable green oasis of willow trees , ponds , fountains and man - made marshes surrounded by shining new towers of glass and steel			2
amid the greenery , several wedding couples posed in tuxedos and gowns for professional photographs , the brides pampered by make - up artists			2
among them were the @entity50 , newly - weds who traveled more than a hundred miles for this photo shoot			2
though they clearly appreciated their surroundings , they said they could not afford to live in the sprawling , newly - constructed district of @entity14			1
the same went for 25 - year - old @entity56 and her friends			2
several years ago , she had an office job at a construction company that built some of @entity14 's rows of towers			1
fantasy photos for @entity5 weddings now a school teacher , @entity56 said , " the housing prices are too high here , " in the newly constructed part of @entity14			1
according to the local statistics bureau , the average income per month in @entity14 is roughly $ 483 while property prices in the new district stand at $ 1,660 per square meter , and are expected to climb			1
amid growing unrest over swollen property markets , premier @entity74 has made affordable property prices a pillar of his leadership			0
however , tighter controls on property markets , such as limitations on homes per person and higher taxes on transactions , have failed to rein in speculative buyers since they were first implemented in 2010			1
the following year , as part of its twelfth five - year plan , the government vowed to build 36 million low - income housing units by 2015 in a bid to quell distressed homebuyers			1
the rush to the cities demand for housing has followed the migration of workers from rural areas to cities where work is better paid and easier to find			1
in early 2012 , for the first time in history , figures showed that more than half of the country 's population live in urban areas			1
the pace of urbanization has been staggering and the government is counting on it as a main driver of economic growth for decades to come			2
" currently @entity5 's urban population is a little over 700 million people , " said @entity117 , author of " @entity5 's @entity118			1
" " by 2030 , we would expect it to be one billion			0
one in eight people on @entity122 will live in a @entity5 city			1
so they still need to do a lot more building			0
" @entity117 predicts there will always be a huge demand for housing in @entity5			1
the challenge will be making it affordable for the @entity5 people			2
@entity14 's population boom according to city government statistics , the population in @entity14 grew by 30 % between 2000 and 2010 , and today stands at close to nine million people , roughly the same population as @entity137 ( 8.245 million in 2011 ) , @entity138 ( 8.174 , 2011 ) and @entity139 ( 8.281 , 2010 )			1
but the city appears to have physically grown even faster			0
in an area nearly twice the size of @entity145 , entire new districts of towers have sprung where 10 years ago locals say there were empty fields			0
armies of construction crews are still hard at work			0
dozens of new towers are in various stages of completion , even though real estate companies are still clearly struggling to fill some of the completed buildings			0
on a street corner , two female university students distributed advertising leaflets to passing drivers and held up a " buy two floors for the price of one " deal for a residential housing development called " @entity166			1
" in the office of another real estate development company , a sales representative told @entity170 all of the units in neighboring residential towers had been sold			0
if so , nobody was bothering to maintain the grounds around the apartment buildings where knee - high grass and weeds grew between 30 - story towers			0
speculators move in meanwhile , real estate sales appeared to be moving more briskly at the @entity182 , where visitors were greeted by football tables , plush velvet couches , a piano , wine and hors d'oeuvres arranged around giant illuminated models of an office park			0
upon arrival , a sales team escorted @entity170 into a cinema with 180 degree , @entity196 - like screen that played an elaborate computer - illustrated film advertising five - star hotels , gyms , shopping malls , offices and restaurants that would one day populate the new development			0
it would be another five or six years before this virtual city center would be completed , said a saleswoman named @entity208			0
asked whether or not she expected there to be enough customers to fill the giant office park , @entity208 said , " altogether , probably not			0
" there are some people buying office buildings for investment and there are others who are using it themselves , " she explained			0
some of @entity5 's soaring real estate market appears to be driven by wealthy @entity5 who prefer parking their money in property rather than in banks where interest rates remain the same as inflation			1
in less than one year , property prices in @entity14 jumped 14 % , while the benchmark interest rate remains at 3 %			2
two @entity5 men who worked as contractors in the construction industry were finalizing a deal on the purchase of two offices in the @entity236 's still unfinished office park			1
both men said they owned multiple properties in the area , some of which were vacant			0
" he owns 20 apartments here ! " said one of the businessman 's employees , laughing			0
" come back after 10 years and have a look and it will be completely different , " he said , when asked about @entity14 's " ghost town " tag			1
the businessman , who asked not to be named , said he earned far better returns in real estate than from banks			0
@entity117 said the buy - up of property in @entity5 is further encouraged by the fact that unlike many @entity261 countries , there is no annual property tax			1
" you pay transaction taxes when you buy a property , but once you 've bought it you do n't pay anything , which is remarkable , " he said			0
build them and they will come ? compared to @entity5 , " the history of urbanization in the @entity272 is different			2
things happened at a much slower pace , " said @entity273 , a political economist and author of " @entity275 -- a people 's @entity278			0
" " @entity5 is a huge country with the capacity to supply the world and now its own market			1
things are bound to happen faster and with more mistakes			0
" the jury is still out on whether or not huge urban development projects like the new districts of @entity14 will become vibrant city centers			1
but @entity117 challenges critics who quickly labeled @entity14 a " ghost city			1
" he said in the past few years city planners had constructed 14 new university campuses in the city , which he predicted would ensure a quarter of a million new residents			0
" @entity5 is different because it has this very authoritarian power structure			2
power rests in the hands of very few people , and that means that local government officials can take big decisions looking ahead 10 , 15 years ... and create something for a society that has n't really arrived yet , " @entity117 said			2
" it 's build them and they will come , " @entity117 added , " and build it and force them to come			0
but of course there will be some big wasteful developments , white elephants , along the way			0

@entity14 is home to what was once called @entity5 's largest ghost city
visitors are now slowing coming back , though many ca n't afford to live there
tighter government controls on housing market has failed to curb price climbs
government is building millions of low - cost housing to meet demand
