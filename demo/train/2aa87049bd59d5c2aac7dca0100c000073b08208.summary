-- the highest - level talks between the @entity2 and @entity3 since president @entity4 took office unfolded wednesday in @entity6 , with a virtual lock - down on information			1
the top @entity2 envoy for @entity3 , @entity10 , is on a three - day visit for meetings to determine whether @entity3 will return to six - party talks on its nuclear program			1
the veteran diplomat is the first senior official from the @entity4 administration to hold direct talks with @entity6			1
the @entity18 offered no new details about the talks , and @entity22 media only acknowledged @entity10 's arrival in a one - line report			2
@entity3 abandoned the six - party talks last april , declaring them " dead , " in anger over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests			1
but the @entity30 also sent signals that it wanted to pursue bilateral talks with the @entity2 instead of a multilateral dialogue			2
meanwhile , the @entity34 also has cooled its tough rhetoric against the @entity2			2
many are wondering what 's behind the @entity34 's latest moves			0
" the visit gives @entity3 a lot of ' face , ' a sense of importance , " said @entity39 , political science professor at the @entity40 in @entity41			0
some analysts say @entity3 might just be trying to buy time			0
earlier reports in @entity50 claimed that @entity3 is in the final stages of restoring its @entity53 nuclear plant , which @entity6 had begun to disable before walking away from the six - party talks in april			1
given the secrecy of the @entity34 , those reports could not be verified			0
analysts say @entity3 is also desperate to break out of its diplomatic isolation and ease its economic pain , especially after the @entity59 imposed tougher sanctions on the communist country in response to @entity6 's nuclear and missile tests earlier this year			1
another reason for @entity6 's moves , analysts say , is neighboring @entity68			2
when @entity68 premier @entity69 visited @entity6 in october , @entity68 pledged much - needed economic , trade and military aid to its communist ally			0
during the three - day visit , president @entity73 indicated that @entity3 was willing to return to the stalled six - party talks -- on condition that there would be progress in direct talks between @entity3 and the @entity2			1
@entity68 has hosted several rounds of the six - party talks , which bring together the @entity2 , @entity34 and @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity68			1
the talks aim to negotiate a deal for @entity3 to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and aid			1
in the end , @entity6 wants direct talks with @entity93 that will eventually lead to diplomatic ties , a peace treaty and economic and trade relations			0
" @entity68 can only act as a go - between , but in the end , the @entity2 and @entity3 will have to resolve critical issues between themselves , " @entity39 said			2
a @entity101 official said @entity10 would not carry any new proposals or new initiatives on his visit			0
" our goal here is , of course , the resumption of the six - party talks and to secure @entity3 's reaffirmation of the september 2005 joint agreement , " @entity101 spokesman @entity105 said a few days before @entity10 's trip			1
he added : " the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the @entity116 ... will be the focus of ambassador @entity10 's trip to @entity6			2
" some observers point to a wide difference in the @entity2 and @entity3 's negotiating positions			1
@entity122 , an expert on @entity3 who has visited the @entity34 many times said , " the @entity2 side always says we do n't want to buy the same horse twice			1
defense secretary ( @entity128 ) @entity127 actually said that several months ago , meaning that we keep giving @entity3 things to get results which we do n't get and we feel that we 've been cheated and we 're making the same deal over and over again			0
but actually the @entity3 feel that they 're the ones who do n't get what we have promised			0
" bridging their differences , observers say , will not be easy			0
" if @entity10 can persuade the @entity3 to return to the six - party talks , all the better , " said @entity137 , a professor at @entity138 in @entity68			1
" on the other hand , it will be understandable if he does not			0
in terms of negotiations , just about all the cards have been put on the table , " he said			0
" it is critically important to be patient with both @entity3 and the @entity2			2
" some see the potential for progress			0
@entity150 , an expert on @entity3 at @entity151 in @entity50 , @entity82 , said there might be options when it comes to @entity3 's nuclear weapons			1
" it 's not that clear - cut , " he said			0
" the @entity157 ended with an armistice			0
technically the war is not yet over			0
the @entity34 wants nuclear weapons as a deterrent against the @entity164 , if the @entity2 offers a security guarantee , pledges that it would n't try a ' regime change ' and sign a peace treaty with @entity3 , the goal of denuclearization is still possible			1
" @entity10 's visit comes after meeting with @entity2 allies			2
he stopped in @entity50 on monday to brief @entity82 officials on his trip to the @entity34			0
@entity172 , a @entity3 analyst at the @entity173 in @entity93 , noted that even the @entity34 's renewed indication that it might return to the stalled six - party talks is not enough and there still is a long way to go to accomplish the denuclearization goal			1
after his visit to the @entity34 , @entity10 is expected to consult with the other six - party countries before returning to @entity93			1
@entity0 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
