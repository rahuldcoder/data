-- the last few years have seen the beginnings of an energy revolution in the @entity3 the coming of shale gas and now shale oil has transformed not just its energy outlook , but also the climate change debate			1
the game has changed : energy independence , the goal first set by @entity11 in the early 1970s , looks like being achievable , at least for the @entity14 continent			1
the game that has changed has profound implications for energy and climate policy			1
to date it has been based upon two assumptions : the first is that fossil fuel prices would go ever upward as oil ( and gas ) production peaked and then declined			0
that , in turn , meant that energy policy should actively try to increase the security of the supply by increasing domestic energy production			1
the second was that climate change is best addressed by a top down international climate change agreement , and that within that framework , the @entity3 should accept a cap on the amount of carbon it would release into the atmosphere			1
the two assumptions fitted together			0
ever rising oil and gas prices would make current renewable energy technologies , like wind and bio-fuels economic ; and energy security would be enhanced through switching away from imported oil and gas			2
taken together , putting a cap on carbon emissions would accelerate this transition , and the @entity3 would want to do this for fear that others who pushed ahead with current renewables -- like the @entity54 -- would gain a competitive advantage as oil and gas prices rose			1
the cap would , on this view , give @entity54 a head start with renewables , and as these become economic against the higher oil and gas prices , fossil fuel dependent countries like the @entity3 would lose out			1
almost everything that could be wrong with this approach has turned out to be so			0
the @entity3 now has cheap natural and shale gas and it has rapidly rising oil production			1
gas prices have more than halved in the last five years , and oil production is up over a quarter over the same period			0
its carbon emissions have fallen to their lowest level for two decades in the first three months of 2012 , partly because it has been able to switch from coal to gas , especially in electricity generation			1
without much by way of either an energy or a climate policy , it has both improved its security and reduced its emissions			1
so great are the potential oil and gas reserves that already @entity14 is producing most of its energy needs			1
@entity87 is having to look to export from its west coast rather than sell its oil and gas to the @entity3 indeed so great is the energy abundance that a process of repatriating energy intensive industries is now getting underway			1
the energy cost advantage of the @entity3 looks likely to outweigh the labor cost advantage of @entity97			1
the @entity3 has adopted only a few really significant policies affecting climate			1
one , the pursuit of ethanol as a fuel is proving very expensive -- and tragic for world food markets			0
another , the fuel efficiency standard for autos , is perhaps the sole example of effective policy on climate			2
the new energy abundance is not however entirely good news : contrary to what many environmentalists have claimed , there are enough fossil fuels to fry the planet several times over			2
the obvious implication is that going green is not going to happen automatically through higher prices			0
on the contrary , low carbon technologies are going to be expensive and therefore out of the market for a long time to come			2
in the @entity3 , nuclear is the biggest casualty , but other renewables face the same challenge			2
nor are the major world economies going to accept top down @entity130 style carbon caps any time soon			0
faced with a serious world economic crisis , and with the @entity3 now in pole position on the energy competitiveness front , the willingness of both @entity97 and @entity54 to go further and faster on carbon caps has got even weaker			1
at the @entity139 climate conference last year all that could be agreed was that nations would try to agree by 2015 what they might do after 2020			2
in @entity143 this year , nobody has had any serious expectation of much progress			0
by 2020 , on current growth rates , the @entity97 and @entity147 economies will be twice their current sizes , with lots more coal burned , and global carbon emissions will be beyond the critical threshold of 400 parts per million and on their way towards 500 ppm , thereby resulting in the 2 degrees - plus temperature rises the scientific consensus predicts			1
faced with this new game , what should the @entity3 -- and indeed the rest of the world -- do about energy and climate change ? two obvious recommendations are : accept that @entity130 is not going anywhere and build on the new gas abundance to get out of coal			1
broadly that is where the @entity3 is heading			2
the next steps are harder : a carbon price is a necessary condition for facing up to the pollution our consumption is causing			2
if we do n't want to pay the price of our pollution , then we do n't want to tackle climate change			2
so far , the sad reality is that we are not prepared to act			0
that is why nothing much has been achieved on the carbon front since 1990			0
why then might the @entity3 consider putting a price on its carbon emissions , through taxing pollution ? one powerful reason has nothing to do with climate change : it needs the money			1
taxing carbon might be politically painful , but not as painful as taxing income			0
so for the wrong reason there are some grounds for optimism			0
what would be even better is if some of the money were spent on new technologies			0
current renewables ca n't bridge the carbon gap			0
low - density intermittent energy just does n't generate enough electricity to carry though decarbonisation			0
but future renewables just might , and here is not only the best hope on the climate front , but also precisely where the @entity3 stars			1
its deep technological base and its entrepreneurial culture provide one of the best places to drive through the necessary advances			0
for the rest of the world , the lessons are much the same			0
everyone needs to switch out of coal , and gas provides a now much more abundant alternative whilst we develop new technologies			0
sadly @entity54 is engaged in a dash from nuclear and gas towards coal			0
it needs to waste less money on current expensive renewables -- especially the really expensive options like offshore wind -- and get serious about future renewables			0
next generation solar technology is an obvious candidate			0
and everyone needs to put a carbon price in place			1
the climate change problem can be cracked , but not through current policies			0
and in the meantime the world needs to get used to the idea that the @entity3 no longer needs the @entity243 to keep its cars and industries moving			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			2

@entity248 : @entity14 *'s* new abundance of energy is a game changer for the climate
he says @entity14 could achieve energy independence and is moving away from coal
without a real climate policy , @entity3 carbon emissions have fallen to lowest level in decades
helm : still needed is for the @entity3 , other nations to put a price on carbon emissions
