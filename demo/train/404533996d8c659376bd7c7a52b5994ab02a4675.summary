-- it 's hard not to become distressed , when i 'm carefully following the situation in @entity4 since violence got worse			1
it 's even more troublesome not to become distressed thinking that there is a bleak future waiting for @entity4			1
the fight by the security forces against unarmed protesters is indeed inhuman			0
more than 2,000 protesters have been murdered and more than 8,000 wounded by security forces across @entity4			2
admittedly , the uprising has a long way to go but one of its great merits so far is the exceptional participation of women			2
i have been astonished by the growing numbers of female protesters as the uprising has proceeded			2
it started with just a few women ; then day after day the number multiplied			0
thousands of female protesters have been actively participating in demonstrations across the country since february 2011			0
female doctors have been playing an important role treating wounded protesters and female activists have been running seminars on political issues			0
mr @entity36 's ( @entity4 's current president ) security forces arrested four female doctors on 19 april 2011 , while the doctors were marching along with a peaceful demonstration to provide medical help if needed			1
the female doctors were released after a huge condemnation and pressure from protesters			0
even female protesters were not immune from the savage killing by pro-government thugs			0
on the 16 october 2011 , i was saddened to see a female protester being shot dead by a thug 's bullets			0
@entity53 was murdered in @entity54 during an attack at a peaceful and unarmed protest by women			0
a very important recognition of women 's participation in @entity4 's uprising is the @entity62 awarded to @entity63 , one of the leading pro-democracy figures in @entity4			1
i believe that there are several motives behind this amazing participation by women -- i myself joined the protests and rallies because i want to build and improve my country			2
i wanted it to be a double revolution ; a political one to topple president @entity36 and a feminist one to ensure that women have equal rights in what @entity4 hope will be a new @entity4			1
it was a double political statement : first , that women have as much right to call for democracy as men , and an indirect message to lift gender apartheid			2
indeed , it 's been hard to be a woman in @entity4			1
a woman 's gender , by default , deprives her of rights enjoyed by men			2
women in @entity4 have been always marginalized in law			1
as in many developing countries , women in @entity4 suffer from limited access to healthcare , economic opportunities and education			1
i remember vividly attending a seminar in @entity102 by @entity103 , one of the leading feminist and human rights activists in @entity4 and founder of @entity107 in in march this year			0
i asked her , " do you think that the uprising will serve women 's rights ? " " we have been dealing with a state system that marginalised women for over three decades ; unfairly snatching their rights , " she said			1
" women in @entity4 have only a restrained degree of legal protection in regard to family matters such as marriage , divorce and inheritance			1
" many women in @entity4 are forced to get married when they are still children			1
this corrupt system means women in @entity4 have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world			1
seven women are raped every month in @entity4 , with no concrete punishment from the state for rapists			1
" women in @entity4 also suffer from illiteracy			2
the current system provides a relatively low degree of protection for women 's physical integrity			0
" there are no laws against domestic violence and the law does not recognize the concept of spousal rape			0
there is zero observation and accountability by the government to ban the practice of female genital mutilation			0
how can women not call for change ! of course the uprising will serve women 's rights , " she told me			2
in a nutshell , the participation of women in the uprising has huge merit			0
what women have done so far embodies their civil and political liberty			0
bearing in mind that freedom for women in @entity4 is usually subject to numerous limitations ; their participation in the uprising is extraordinary			1
what they are doing is really a protest against socio - political norms that have always limited their freedoms .			0

@entity174 is a @entity4 *journalist* and *blogger* currently living in @entity175

@entity174 hopes the uprising will lead to greater gender equality
