the 24 - year - old , who last month was sidelined with ankle damage , went off with a recurrence of his recent groin problem 13 minutes from the end of @entity7 's 4 - 0 victory over @entity14			1
he was unable to score , finishing his @entity16 season with 34 goals and missing out on the @entity19 's golden boot award to @entity21 's @entity20 , who netted a hat - trick in the 8 - 0 victory over @entity24 that ended @entity7 's three - year grip on the title			2
