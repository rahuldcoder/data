authorities investigating this week 's deadly shooting spree at @entity2 said friday that an altercation between spc. @entity4 and his fellow soldiers , rather than a medical condition , may have led to @entity4 opening fire			1
" the immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area , " lt. gen. @entity8 , the post 's commanding general , told reporters			1
some of the soldiers involved in the altercation were victims in the shooting , according to @entity18 , spokesman for the @entity19 , who appeared with @entity8 at a news conference on the sprawling post			1
officials would not release further details about the argument , saying the investigation was still ongoing into what caused the 34 - year - old to set out on a shooting spree that left three soldiers dead and 16 wounded before he killed himself			1

@entity43 , sister of sgt. @entity44 , said on @entity46 's " @entity45 " that her brother " was at work and a guy came in and asked for a leave form			2
" the soldier was told he would have to come back later , @entity51 said , " and apparently i guess he did n't want to hear that , so he came back and just opened fire , " @entity51 said			2

" at this time , we have not established a concrete motive , " @entity18 said			0
investigators have not uncovered any history of criminal convictions or previous criminal activity by @entity4 , nor have they found any links to terrorism			1
on thursday @entity8 said investigators believed a medical history that indicates an unstable psychiatric or psychological condition may be a " fundamental causal factor , " in the shooting			2
