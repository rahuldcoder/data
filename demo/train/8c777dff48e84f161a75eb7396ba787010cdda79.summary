@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has a @entity4 , @entity6 attitude			1
his pride swells along with his tattooed biceps			2
he 's a dying breed , a blue - collar @entity11 working on a product as @entity11 as apple pie			1
" this is our lifeline , " @entity15 says			2
those jeans you squeezed into this morning ? it 's likely they began right here at @entity23 , one of the last functioning cotton mills in @entity6 and the nation 's no. 1 producer of denim			1
in a tiny enclave of northwest @entity1 , @entity15 and 1,200 of his colleagues churn out enough denim per week for 800,000 pairs of blue jeans			1
most @entity11 mills shut down years ago , unable to compete with cheap overseas labor			1
and in another sign of the global economy , the fabric woven here is rarely sent to @entity11 plants to be turned into jeans			1
instead , the fabric is shipped mostly to factories in @entity45			0
the jeans then carry labels that read " made in @entity45 of @entity11 fabric			1
blame corporate greed for the selling out of @entity6 's manufacturing soul			1
" i 'd rather see people over here work , instead of struggling -- instead of giving somebody in another country a chance to make money that [ @entity11 ] should be making , " says @entity15 , 31			1
he 's got a scar across his forehead , a shaved head and goatee			1
like a pair of well - worn blue jeans , he 's rough and tough			1
some workers here are second - and third - generation employees , following in the footsteps of their fathers , mothers and grandparents			0
@entity15 's dad and brother work at the mill. you can see the pride in their faces : made in @entity11 , baby			1
" we contribute a lot to @entity6 , " @entity15 says with a smile			1
he 's a father of four young daughters			1
he makes about $ 9 an hour			0
he toils for them , for his little girls , so they can have a better a life			0
" this mill here , " he says , " it feeds my family			1
" it has been in existence since 1845 , when slaves handpicked cotton in the @entity99			1
back then , mill workers spun the cotton into fabric and shipped it to factories in the @entity104			1
it 's said gen. @entity106 came through @entity0 , @entity1 , during the @entity107 and decided not to burn the factory down			1
the reason remains town lore			0
some speculate the @entity113 general might 've been treated to the charms of southern hospitality at the local hotel ( wink , wink )			0
what 's a good @entity121 tale without -- dare we say it ? -- some yarnspinning			1
" @entity125 " who fights for workers inside , you ca n't help but marvel at the scene around you			0
hundreds of spools of thread churn all at once , with computer - like precision			0
there 's a million - square - feet of manufacturing space , much of it @entity136 rock maple hardwood floors			1
it 's clean with a brilliant shine			1
thread shoots every which way , as if @entity142 came through			0
go from cotton field to denim the sweet , distinct smell of cotton permeates the mill -- like that of nature in a hardwood forest , with the faint hint of a wet labrador retriever			1
when you walk through with general manager @entity155 , the workers pause			0
they glance at " @entity125 "			0
many stroll over to shake his hand			0
how you doing ? everything , ok ? @entity155 is one reason this place is still in business , on @entity11 soil			1
he has an aww - shucks attitude			0
he 'll tell you it 's those men and women out there on the floor that keep it going			1
he 's got pride in the plant , in his workers and in his family			1
his father worked for 39 years in the spinning department			0
his brother retired from the plant after 42 years , having started when he was 16 and eventually making his way into management			0
" if i had the ultimate say - so , we would be right here for the next 100 years , " says @entity155 , 64 , who has worked in the plant for 40 years			0
while the nation 's manufacturing base has shrunk , @entity23 is a rare exception			1
the tiny town of @entity0 -- pronounced try - on , as in " our residents always ' try on , ' " 78 - year - old mayor @entity192 says -- has a staggeringly large annual budget for such a small town			0
its $ 12 million , mostly from taxes the mill pays , provides a state - of - the - art public school , park space and athletic fields			1
if the mill shuttered , " it would destroy the town , " @entity192 says			2
in its heydey , the mill had 5,000 workers in the 1940s and 1950s			2
the company owned everything in town back then , from the tiny mill houses that surround the plant to the town hospital where @entity155 and many of his co-workers were born			2
as a result , @entity0 does n't have a quaint town square			0
the mill is the centerpiece			2
about two years ago , when the nation 's recession hit hard , the plant had to layoff about 200 workers			2
" it was awful , " @entity155 says			0
to save as many jobs as possible and to maximize efficiency , the plant switched to two , 12 - hour shifts			0
that 's down from three shifts , five days a week			2
the denim for jeans goes to companies as wide - ranging as @entity230 to @entity231 to @entity232 to @entity233 and other high - priced brands			2
@entity155 's most proud of the mill 's ties to cowboys			1
" we make the @entity240 rodeo cowboy jeans that all the rodeo guys still wear , " he says			0
" we make the fabric right here and have been for -- gosh -- 30 years			0
" @entity155 holds up one roll of distressed fabric that 's nearly ready to be shipped			2
it 's denim that once was used for lower - end clothing			1
but yuppies like the look			0
@entity155 chuckles and shakes his head			0
@entity251 is 63 and has worked in the mill for the past 35 years			2
she says other company towns had bosses that sold them out , that cared more about the dollar than its people			0
" it just gives me a good feeling to be a part of that family of @entity23 , " says @entity258 , who has a son working at the plant			2
" it has educated my children and gives us a house and everything we have really			0
" @entity15 wheels 13,000 yards of yarn into the dimly lit " ballroom			0
" it 's placed among a heap of others			2
" we 're lucky to have what we got			0
other small towns , they do n't have that			0
" he turns and walks away in the orange glow of the ballroom			0
you want to know a secret ? a $ 12 pair of jeans often comes from the same roll of denim as a $ 150 designer pair .			2
