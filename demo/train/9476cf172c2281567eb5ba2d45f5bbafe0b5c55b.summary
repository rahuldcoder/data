@entity32 reporter @entity31 said that the whole execution process took 24 minutes , and that @entity7 appeared to be gasping for air for 10 to 13 minutes			1

a couple of times , he definitely appeared to be choking , " @entity28 quoted @entity31 as saying			0
the convicted murderer was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m. et. the execution generated controversy because , like many states , @entity1 has been forced to find new drug protocols after @entity50 - based manufacturers banned @entity52 prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them , @entity56 - based @entity55 , which manufactures pentobarbital			1
according to @entity1 's corrections department , the state used a combination of the drugs midazolam , a sedative ; and the painkiller hydromorphone			0
both the length of time it took for @entity7 to die and his gasping are not typical for an execution , said @entity69 , an anesthesiologist at @entity70 in @entity71			1

" " the state disagrees			0
but the truth is that no one knows exactly how @entity7 will die , how long it will take or what he will experience in the process , " wrote @entity87 , clinic professor of law and director of the @entity89 at @entity90			1
speaking on behalf of @entity7 's legal team , attorney @entity96 called on the governor to impose a moratorium on future executions because of what took place thursday			1
" at this point , it is entirely premature to consider this execution protocol to be anything other than a failed , agonizing experiment , " he said in a statement			1
" the people of the @entity1 should be appalled at what was done here today in all of our names			0
@entity1 , like its citizens , must follow the law			0
" @entity29 's @entity117 said that @entity7 's execution will likely spark debate over whether how inmates react to the use of the drugs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the @entity52 @entity124			2
" whenever there 's a change in the lethal injection process clearly it 's subject to legal proceedings and perhaps we will see those , " @entity117 said			2
@entity1 ran out of pentobarbital , which is a narcotic and sedative barbiturate , in september , according to @entity135 , spokeswoman for the @entity136			0
