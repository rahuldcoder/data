@entity0 -- the wave of anti-japanese protests currently sweeping across @entity4 has its roots in history but more recently can be traced back to april , when the firebrand governor of @entity8 announced plans to buy a group of islands claimed by @entity12 , @entity4 and @entity13			1
he did so without the apparent knowledge or approval of the @entity12 government			1
spying an opportunity to assert @entity12 control over the @entity11 , or @entity11 as they 're known in @entity4 , governor @entity18 launched an online appeal fund to buy them from their private owners			1
donations poured in , prompting a sharp rebuke from @entity4 and forcing the @entity12 government to wade into the dispute with its own offer for the contested land			1
who is @entity18 ? @entity18 has a long history of making inflammatory comments about @entity4 , so much so that in 1999 , when he was appointed @entity8 governor , @entity12 's then chief cabinet secretary , @entity34 , sought to reassure @entity4 that relations would remain " friendly			1
" before taking office , @entity18 was a well - known author whose name became famous in his early twenties after writing " a @entity39 , " which won @entity12 's most prestigious literary prize			1
he 's an outspoken nationalist who in the past has cast doubt on historians ' account of the 1937 rape of @entity46 , in which hundreds of thousands of @entity4 were killed by @entity12 troops			1
after launching the fund , @entity18 likened @entity4 's claim to the islands as like " a burglar in @entity12 's house			1
" what was @entity4 's reaction ? back in june , @entity56 spokesman @entity55 dismissed @entity18 's attempt to buy the islands as " irresponsible , " and repeated @entity4 's ownership claim			2
" the @entity11 are @entity4 's territory since ancient times , " he said			0
" the willful talk and action of some @entity12 politicians is irresponsible and tarnish and smears @entity12 's reputation			1
" when did the @entity12 government step in ? faced with the prospect of the islands falling under the jurisdiction of the @entity8 metropolitan government , the @entity12 government stepped in with its own bid for the disputed islands			1
on september 11 , @entity12 's chief cabinet secretary @entity73 confirmed that the government had approved the islands ' purchase from private owners for 2.05 billion yen ( us $ 26.2 million )			1
in an interview with @entity1 , @entity12 prime minister @entity78 claimed there was no territorial dispute within @entity4 and the only question of ownership emanated from within @entity12			2
" the @entity11 are an inherent part of @entity12 territory , historically as well as under international law , so there 's no territorial claim issue between the two countries , " he said			0
" right now , it is the ownership issue -- whether the individual owns these islands , or the @entity8 metropolitan government or the state			2
and i think we have to clearly and solidly explain these stances to the @entity4 side			0
" @entity4 responded by dispatching six patrol ships to the surrounding waters , ignoring a warning from the @entity12 coastguard not to approach			2
they entered the disputed waters for a short time before leaving , @entity12 's coast guard reported			2
at a press conference , @entity18 said of the @entity4 patrols : " we 'd better shoo off those who walked into someone 's home in dirty shoes , we should shoo them away			0
" " i think @entity4 has gone crazy			0
we ca n't put up with their attitude like @entity118 is mine , but yours is mine too , " he added , in quotes that appeared on the @entity115 government website			0
citing a government statement , state - run news agency @entity121 said the patrols were " aimed to demonstrate @entity4 's jurisdiction over the @entity11 , " while the @entity12 prime minister said the government would " take all possible measures to ensure security " around the islands			1
how a war of words turned into protests while the verbal sparring between the @entity4 and @entity12 governments has played out in a series of statements , protesters from both sides have been taking direct action to assert their countries ' control over the islands			1
in late august , @entity12 deported 14 @entity4 protesters who were arrested after five swam ashore the @entity11 and waved the flags of @entity4 and @entity13			2
nine others aboard the waiting vessel were also detained			0
days later after the @entity4 landing , @entity12 activists also made the journey to the remote islets to raise the @entity12 flag , prompting @entity4 to lodge " solemn representations to the @entity12 ambassador , " according to @entity121			2
the @entity12 landing sparked protests by thousands of people in a number of @entity4 cities , including @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , according to @entity121			1
that was on august 19 , almost one month before violent @entity166 protests erupted across dozens of @entity4 cities , forcing the temporary closure of operations at three plants belonging to @entity12 electronics company @entity171			1
background to the dispute @entity4 says its claim extends back hundreds of years			0
@entity12 says it saw no trace of @entity4 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity12 sovereign territory in 1895			2
@entity12 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers			0
the @entity12 surrender at the end of @entity185 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further			0
the islands were administered by the @entity189 occupation force after the war			0
but in 1972 , @entity191 returned them to @entity12 as part of its withdrawal from @entity195			0
analysts say @entity4 's policy on the islands has been maintaining the status quo			2
according to @entity121 , " both sides agreed in 1978 to put the issue aside and solve it in the future , using a guideline described as ' laying aside disputes and engaging in joint exploitation ' to solve territorial issues with neighboring countries			0
" " @entity4 's proposal is that we should maintain status quo , neither side should take action to escalate the differences			0
regrettably the @entity12 government has disrespected the @entity4 proposal , " said @entity214 , the @entity215 of the @entity216 at @entity217 in @entity218 , in an interview with the @entity220			1
why are the islands considered valuable ? aside from a strong sense of nationalism , a 1969 @entity225 report provided added incentive for countries to claim ownership of the islands			0
the report , by the @entity232 for @entity233 and the @entity234 ( @entity235 ) , indicated the possibility of large oil reserves in the vicinity , according to @entity240			0
the islands are close to strategically important shipping lanes and their legal owners would also have the right to fish surrounding waters			0
what happens now ? the @entity4 government has been calling for restraint and " rational patriotism " when it comes to public protests			1
the @entity189 has also weighed in on the issue with @entity189 defense secretary @entity253 urging " calm and restraint on all sides			0
" as @entity253 spoke , @entity78 was telling senior government officials to stay on their guard in dealing with mass anti-japanese protests , according to @entity12 news agency @entity258			1
meanwhile , the prospect of economic sanctions has been raised in a strongly worded opinion piece in the state - controlled @entity263 newspaper			0
@entity265 wrote that @entity267 rules could be used to limit export of " important materials " to @entity12			0
" the global financial crisis increased @entity12 's reliance on @entity4 for its economic well - being			1
so it 's clear that @entity4 can deal a heavy blow to the @entity12 economy without hurting itself too much by resorting to sanctions , " said @entity265 , deputy director of the department of @entity4 trade studies at the @entity275 of international trade and economic cooperation , which is affiliated to the @entity277 .			2
