@entity0 , @entity1 -- beneath the streets of the @entity0 lies a world draped in darkness and shrouded in silence			1
the tunnels are narrow , the ceilings are low and death is on display			0
the skulls and bones lining the walls , arranged in a macabre fashion , make up what is known as the @entity16 -- the @entity17			2
the catacombs snake below the city , a 321 - kilometer ( 200 - mile ) network of old quarries , caves and tunnels			1
some @entity24 are drawn to this largely uncharted territory -- a hidden network of adventure , discovery and even relaxation			1
they are known as ' cataphiles ' and the catacombs are their playground			1
it is a top - secret group			0
catacomb entrances are known only to those daring enough to roam the networks on their own -- and break the law			0
entering unauthorized sections of the catacombs is illegal and a police force is tasked with patrolling the tunnels , and caught cataphiles risk fines of up to 60 euros ( $ 73 )			2
but for explorers like @entity45 and his friends , it is a risk they are willing to take			0
" i think it 's in the collective imagination			0
everybody knows that there is something below @entity0 ; that something goes on that 's mysterious			1
but i do n't think many people have even an idea of what the underground is like , " @entity45 said			1
for those who want to find out , but are not willing to take the risk of going in unsupervised , there is a legal , tourist - friendly public entrance to the catacombs off @entity63			2
visitors from around the world will queue up to see death on display			0
" i think people are fascinated with death , " one visitor said			2
" they do n't know what it 's about and you see all these bones stacked up , and the people that have come before us , and it 's fascinating			2
we 're trying to find our past and it 's crazy and gruesome and fun all at the same time			0
" but experiencing the history of @entity0 in an orderly fashion is not the cataphiles ' style			1
underground , there are plaques echoing the street names above etched into the walls , helping the cataphiles navigate			2
often equipped only with head lamps and homemade maps , they explore the tunnels and ancient rooms , sometimes staying underground for days at a time			2
they throw parties , drink wine , or just relax in a silence they say ca n't be experienced anywhere else			2
the catacombs are a by - product of @entity0 ' early development			1
builders dug deep underground to extract limestone to build @entity0 above ground			1
but the subterranean quarries that were formed proved to be a shaky foundation for the city , causing a number of streets to collapse and be swallowed up by the ground			0
eventually , repairs and reinforcements were made , and to this day , the tunnels and quarries are still monitored for safety			0
the quarries went through several transformations throughout history			0
over time , they have served as everything from hiding places for revolutionaries to mushroom farms			0
in the 18th century the @entity17 became known as the @entity16			0
@entity0 ' dead had been buried in cemeteries and beneath churches in the city center , but the number of bodies began to overwhelm the land , breaking through the walls of people 's cellars and causing major health concerns			1
so , beginning in the 1780s , the bodies were transferred in carriages at night to a new , final resting place in the old quarries			1
in those tunnels there are now the remains of more than six million people			1
and for the cataphiles , the life among the dead opens up new dreams and possibilities			0
" it 's like an alternate reality , " @entity45 said			0
" you do n't have the same sort of social interaction with people as you do above			0
you are free to invent yourself again , to be somebody else			1
" bone people : the explorers of the @entity0 catacombs			1

beneath the streets of the @entity1 *capital* lies a hidden , macabre @entity0 playground
the catacombs are also the last resting place for six million people
adventurous @entity24 use the underground network as a place to party and relax
one said : you are free to invent yourself again , to be somebody else
