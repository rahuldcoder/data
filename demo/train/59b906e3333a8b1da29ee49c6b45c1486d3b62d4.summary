" i think , when the moment finally comes , i 'll probably have mixed feelings about it , " @entity0 said			1
" it will be like coming to the last page of a book you do n't want to end			1
the book has been a good one , but you 're sad that it 's over			1
" he is 98 years old			1
he was part of a military unit whose valor is written indelibly on the pages of this nation 's history			2
the @entity18 flew their " @entity20 " mission in april 1942 , when , in the wake of @entity24 , spirits in the @entity22 were at a low point			1
the 80 @entity26 , flying 16 bombers under the command of @entity29 , showed the world that @entity22 would never give up			2
" we had planned on waiting until there were only two of us left to open the bottle and have our final toast , " @entity0 said			1
" but we do n't want to wait any longer			2
as fragile as most of us are , it 's time			2
" so , on saturday , at the @entity38 on @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 , the few @entity26 who still are alive will open the bottle of 1896 @entity44 cognac -- 1896 was the year of @entity29 's birth -- and raise a solemn toast to their crewmates who have died			1
" all 80 of us knew each other , from all our training missions , " @entity0 said			2
" i can still close my eyes and see their faces , hear their voices			2
we were a pretty good team			2
" pretty good ? they were the finest and bravest warriors this nation had to offer			2
@entity0 was @entity18 's co-pilot in the first of the 16 planes to take off from the deck of the @entity58 in the @entity59			1
" we knew that we had just separated ourselves from civilization , " he said			2
" there were no long - range radios in the planes			2
and , of course , there was no turning back			2
" there was a time when every schoolchild in the @entity22 was taught about the courage of the @entity26			2
it was a true - life story the country knew by heart : the @entity22 , after @entity24 , was in terrible trouble in the @entity59			2
launching a counterattack on @entity76 seemed impossible , because there were no @entity22 airfields close enough			0
and then came the @entity18 , 80 volunteers with guts enough to thrill their countrymen			1
they would fly 16 specially modified b - 25s from the deck of the @entity58			0
launching heavy bombers from a carrier had never been tried ; returning to the ship was not an option			0
the plan was to hit @entity89 , then hope to make it safely to @entity91			1
but when there were reports on the day of the raid that @entity76 had learned of the mission , a decision was made : the planes had to take off from much farther out in the @entity59 than had been anticipated			1
from that distance there was not enough fuel to get them to safety			0
and those men took off anyway			0
" i was scared , frightened -- just about any word you can think of that describes being apprehensive , " @entity0 said			0
" but i knew i was flying with the best pilot in the world			0
" @entity18 's men hit @entity89 , then flew as far as they could			1
eleven crews had to bail out ; four crews crash - landed and one plane made it to @entity115			0
two @entity26 died as they bailed out			0
eight were captured by the @entity76 ; three of them were executed , and five were sentenced to life in prison			0
one died of starvation ; the others were grievously mistreated for more than three years			0
when 2013 began , there were five surviving @entity26 , but then @entity125 died			0
so now there are four : @entity0 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
their annual april reunions have come to an end			0
but even with all their somber and prayerful annual toasts to those they have lost , they have never opened the bottle of 1896 cognac			1
now , at the @entity38 , they will			0
it is unclear whether @entity127 is in good enough health to make it to @entity40 ; the others plan to be there			0
this will be it , forever			0
when the bottle is opened , @entity0 said , " i know there will be tears , at least in my case			1
" he said he hopes that today 's young americans will take one lesson from what the @entity18 did : " i would like for them to understand that there are times in one 's life that require a lot of sacrifices			1
if you want to live free , you 've got to make those sacrifices			0
" there is one piece of unfinished business : @entity29 , who died in 1993 , was awarded the @entity167			0
but the raid was not a one - man mission ; @entity18 would have been the first to vociferously point that out			1
friends and admirers of the @entity26 have been trying to persuade @entity173 , in recognition of the @entity26 ' contribution to this country , to award the entire 80 - man squad not the @entity167 , but the @entity178 , one of our nation 's highest tributes			1
no one is asking for @entity173 to strike 80 gold medals -- just one , in the @entity26 ' name , while some of the crew are still alive			1
you would n't think it would be difficult			0
the @entity178 has been presented to , among others , @entity191 and @entity192			1
you 'd think the @entity18 would rate one			1
and their supporters have gone about the request in the proper way			0
a bill asking for authorization of the medal was introduced in a bipartisan manner : a @entity202 , @entity203 of @entity41 , introduced it in the @entity205 , and a @entity206 , @entity207 of @entity208 , introduced it in the @entity210			0
there are not enough co-sponsors in either chamber to get the medal authorized			0
the slowness seems to come not from any animosity , but from indifference			0
@entity173 has other things to do			1
meanwhile , the clock ticks on the @entity26			0
@entity0 is 98 ; @entity128 and @entity127 are 94 ; @entity129 is 92			0
as @entity222 -- a friend and longtime admirer of the @entity26 who has worked to get the medal authorized and has tried to get the attention of members of @entity173 -- said : " @entity228 is not on the @entity26 ' side			1
" so those brave men will gather in @entity40 next weekend for their final toast			1
before they do , here is a simple question for @entity173 : can you not even do this right ? the @entity18 have earned that medal			1
but it is n't the @entity26 who should be grateful to be associated with @entity173			1
it is @entity173 that should be proud and grateful to be permitted to be associated with the @entity26 .			1

@entity241 : the four remaining @entity18 are planning a final reunion on saturday
now in their *90s* , the famed @entity245 bomber pilots will crack a bottle of fine cognac for a toast
for their *perilous* @entity89 mission , they *deserve* @entity178 , he says
@entity241 : @entity191 got one , why not them ? @entity173 , can you at least do this right ?
