-- a former chairman of the @entity2 says in a new book that while @entity4 was in the @entity5 , a key component of the president 's nuclear launch protocol went missing			1
" the codes were actually missing for months			2
this is a big deal , " says general @entity10			2
" we dodged a silver bullet			0
" in his book " without @entity27 , " the retired army general writes , " even though movies may show the president wearing these codes around his neck , it 's pretty standard that they are safeguarded by one of his aides , but that aide sticks with him like glue			0
" he adds that president @entity4 " assumed , i 'm sure , that the aide had them like he was supposed to			2
" what apparently was missing was a card with code numbers on it that allows the president to access a briefcase -- called the " football " and kept by an aide always near the president -- containing instructions for launching a nuclear attack			1
once a month , @entity43 officials conduct an in - person verification to make sure the president has the right codes			0
at least twice in a row , @entity10 writes , a @entity5 aide told the @entity43 checker that the president was in a meeting but gave a verbal assurance that the codes were with him			1
then one month around the year 2000 , according to @entity10 , when the time came to replace the codes with a new set , " the president 's aide said neither he nor the president had the codes -- they had completely disappeared			1
" @entity10 writes that all this happened very likely without @entity4 's knowledge			1
@entity0 called and e-mailed a spokesman for president @entity4 thursday , but there was no immediate response			1
@entity67 , who served as homeland security advisor to president @entity69 and who is a @entity0 contributor on national security issues , said thursday , " i ca n't imagine a more serious breach , if something like that were ever to be lost or be compromised			0
" that 's the command and control capability of the president to launch a nuclear attack			2
" but if an unauthorized person found or obtained the codes , she said , it is very unlikely that they could execute a launch , because they are only one part of the launch protocol			0
another part of that protocol is the " football , " containing the actual launch instructions			1
@entity67 said it 's a multi-layered system			0
" even if you had a piece that was required , it would be very difficult for one person to execute the command and control of this thing , " @entity67 said			0
" there are plenty of things to be concerned about			0
i just find it difficult to imagine somebody could execute this thing , if they found a piece to it			0
" @entity10 says the president was given new codes within minutes when the previous codes could not be found , and the procedures have since been changed , so that the @entity43 aide who carries out the monthly check is required to wait at the @entity5 until he or she can visually confirm the codes are in the possession of the president or an aide who is with him .			1
