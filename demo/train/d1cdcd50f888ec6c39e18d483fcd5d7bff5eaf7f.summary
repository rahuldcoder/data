-- @entity1 has intensified its efforts to forge closer relations with @entity4 recently , as the sixth largest economy in the world tries to compete with other emerging giants like @entity8 and @entity9 to take a more central role in the resource - rich continent			1
last month , @entity1 's top investment bank @entity13 unveiled plans to raise $ 1 billion to create the world 's biggest investment fund for @entity4 , focusing on areas such as infrastructure , energy and agriculture			1
the independent bank 's fund , which comes amid a government drive to establish a strategic partnership with @entity4 , is one of the latest moves signaling @entity1 's increasing interest to extend its economic footprint on the continent -- trade between @entity1 and @entity4 jumped from around $ 4 billion in 2000 to about $ 20 billion in 2010			1
" it does represent a turning point where a lot of these investors and these entities for investments are recognizing that @entity4 is indeed the last frontier for growth , " says @entity30 , director of the @entity31 at the @entity32 in @entity4			0
eyeing potential an unprecedented decade of economic growth in @entity4 , coupled with a series of policy and institutional reforms , has attracted emerging global powers into the continent , seeking to gain a stronger foothold in the continent in their bid to reach more markets and forge new political alliances			2

" @entity1 has kind of been operating under the radar , it is not seen necessarily as one of those kind of players [ @entity8 and @entity9 ] , " says @entity60 , research fellow in the @entity61 at @entity62			0
" the stories of @entity1 with @entity4 have also been less contentious -- you 've heard stories from @entity71 about miners being mistreated by their @entity8 bosses but you do n't hear from @entity74 or @entity75 when it comes to @entity1 companies			1
" using @entity81 - speaking countries like @entity75 and @entity74 as an entry point to the continent , @entity1 's state and private companies have made big inroads in various parts the continent , operating mostly in strategic sectors such as infrastructure , mining and energy -- last year , mining giant @entity91 announced plans to spend more than Â £ 12 billion on investments in @entity4 over the next five years			1
but while @entity1 , like @entity8 , seems to be deeply engaged with the @entity57 resource sector , some analysts say its strategy and interests are quite distinct from its resource - hungry @entity99 partner			2
" being a resource - rich country and a future major oil exporter itself , @entity1 is not pursuing a strategy to secure resources , " says @entity100 , research at the @entity102			0

" strong ties although separated by the @entity124 , @entity1 and @entity4 have long historical and cultural ties , dating back to the days of slave trade in the 16th century , where scores of @entity57 where shipped to the former @entity81 colony to be exploited as slaves on the sugar cane plantations			1
today , @entity1 is quick to use this cultural affinity with @entity4 as an advantage in its competition with the other powers acting on the continent , analysts say			1
" the fact that the majority of @entity1 's population is of @entity143 origin -- making @entity1 the world 's largest black population after @entity146 -- is frequently quoted by the , almost exclusively white , governing elite of @entity1 in order to stress @entity1 's cultural similarities with the @entity57 countries , " says @entity100			0

during his eight - year tenure , @entity154 made 12 trips to @entity4 , visiting 21 countries , more than any of his predecessors			0

business model analysts say @entity1 has adopted a three - pronged approach to its engagement with @entity4 , with an " almost seamless interaction " between the government , the private sector and development institutions			1
" this all kind of comes together as one coherent strategy toward @entity4 from @entity1 , " says @entity30			2
@entity1 companies seeking to do business in the continent tend to hire and train local workforce and offer social projects to foster home - grown development -- in @entity75 , @entity1 construction company @entity184 has become the largest private employer in the country			0
knowledge transfer in recent decades , @entity1 has gone from being a net importer of food to one of the world 's biggest exporters of agricultural and food products			0
more recently , @entity1 's per capita income rose an average of 1.8 % faster than its gdp in 2003 - 09 , according to a @entity205 report			0
as a result , @entity1 's domestic development experience and success in narrowing social inequality have attracted attention from several @entity57 countries who are keen to replicate some of its programs			0
analysts say @entity1 is keen to leverage its advanced technological know - how in helping @entity57 countries in areas that are key to the continent 's development , including tropical agriculture and disease fighting			0
