@entity0 , @entity1 -- graduates of the nation 's most vilified high school descended upon campus tuesday evening to support the school 's fired teachers			1
they also had a message for president @entity11 : do n't bash our school			1
" he does n't know us			0
he does n't know the teachers			0
he does n't know the students , " said @entity16 , 21 , a graduate of @entity17 in 2006			0
" i think it 's a real outrage what 's happening here			1
" nearby , @entity21 , 19 , stood on the school 's steps clutching a sign that read : " @entity11 , i supported you , your causes , goals and beliefs			1
why are n't you supporting mine ? " a firestorm has erupted in this @entity32 stronghold in recent weeks after 93 teachers , support staff and administrators at @entity17 were fired for the low performance of the school , which graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year			1
the firings will go into effect at the end of the school year			1
teachers can re-apply , but no more than 50 percent will get rehired			0
@entity11 weighed in last week , endorsing the actions of the local board			1

" i could n't believe it , " said @entity21 , who graduated in 2008			0
" ever since the beginning , i thought firing all the teachers was a ridiculous notion			0

when i went through high school , i went through a lot of personal problems and my teachers were always there for me			2
" of the 800 students who currently attend @entity0 , 65 percent are @entity68 ; @entity87 is a second language for most			0
half the students are failing every subject , with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math , officials say			0
the defenders of the school say improvements have been made , but the stats are skewed against them because the school 's population is so transient			1
tuesday 's demonstration was to coincide with a board of trustees meeting , where the firings were to be the main topic			1
however , the meeting was abruptly called off , because the governor 's @entity105 on @entity107 said the school 's auditorium was unfit for people with disabilities			1
on the steps outside the school , @entity112 shrugged			2
he cast suspicion on the reason for the meeting 's cancellation			2
" unless they mean , it 's not fit for morally disabled people , " he said			1
@entity112 has been a guidance counselor at @entity0 for the last 15 years			0
his wife is a chemistry teacher			0

" he suggested @entity11 should summon the 93 teachers and administrators for a beer summit			1
the president " has n't heard our side of the story , " said @entity112 , a member of the teachers ' union			2
" he has n't listened to us			0
he knows nothing about us			0
" @entity133 , president of the @entity134 of teachers , was less hospitable toward the president			2
" we 're all taking our bumper stickers for @entity11 off our cars , " @entity133 said earlier in the day			1
she said the union supports school reform			2
she called for an independent mediator to intervene at @entity0 because tensions have gotten so high between the union and the school administrators who carried out the firings			2
" this is unprecedented , " @entity133 said			0
" i do n't think anyone was prepared for this kind of fallout			0
" school superintendent @entity150 said she stands by her decision			2
she noted the school did n't graduate half its seniors last year			2
" somebody has n't spoken up for them , the other 50 percent , " she said			0
as darkness fell at the school , the graduates who had come back said the problems at the school have been oversimplified and that the rest of the nation ca n't understand the importance of the teachers in the tough environment they live			1
@entity16 said one of the most important men in his life was his creative writing teacher , @entity166			0
a freshly planted tree stands on the school 's lawn to honor the legacy of @entity173			1
he was killed in an accident by a drunk driver last summer			0
encouraged by his high school teacher , @entity16 has taken up poetry			2
" a lot of these teachers here helped me through hard times , " he said			0
