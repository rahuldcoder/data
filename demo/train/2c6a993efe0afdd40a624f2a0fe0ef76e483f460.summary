@entity0 -- when president @entity3 unveiled his revamped national security team in the @entity5 , he quickly joked about how badly defense secretary @entity6 has been itching to finally get serious about retirement			1
" when i took office , @entity6 had already served under seven presidents , and he carried a clock that counted down the days , hours , and minutes until he could return to @entity11 with his wife , @entity12 , " @entity3 said			0
he added that he felt lucky to get @entity6 to keep pushing the exit date back to deal with wars in @entity15 and @entity16 as well as some major budget decisions confronting the nation			1
first it was @entity3 during the presidential transition in december 2008 getting @entity6 to stay on for just one more year for continuity 's sake			0
then that grew to staying on for first 2Â½ years of the administration			0
senior officials tell me that @entity3 had even been hoping to somehow persuade @entity6 to stay on through all four years of the first term for the good of the country , but the president finally gave in and then set his sights to twisting the reluctant arm of cia director @entity33 to delay his own retirement to take the top spot at the @entity36			2
@entity3 shuffles familiar faces in key security roles as @entity3 noted to laughter about his lobbying of @entity6 , " at some point along the way , @entity6 threw out that clock			0
" it was an apt metaphor , because top defense analysts say the clock is ticking on the @entity3 administration as its first -- and possibly only -- term in office winds down			1
" the timing right now is really critical in terms of how the resources will get sorted out , " said @entity49 , head of the defense industrial practice at the @entity51			2
@entity49 is referring to the fact that @entity33 and the rest of the new team will have just 18 months to deal with the arduous task of somehow squeezing hundreds of billions of dollars out of the planned @entity36 budget for the next decade or so -- it 's pretty much impossible to find a way to get the numbers in @entity3 's deficit - cutting plan to add up without significant defense savings			1
and they have to do this while winding down two very expensive wars in @entity15 and @entity16 , trying to help finish the mission in @entity69 , preparing for possible conflicts anywhere from @entity71 to @entity72 , all the while trying to figure out how things will settle down in the @entity74			2
no wonder @entity33 had to have his arm twisted to take this job , and he even joked to the crowd that the departing @entity6 was easy to spot at the event because he was the " guy with the big smile next to me " on the platform			2
@entity33 immediately noted the mind - numbing change the world has witnessed in recent months			2
" as the son of immigrants , i was raised to believe that we can not be free unless we are secure , " he said			0
" today we are a nation at war			0
and job one will be to ensure that we are the strongest military power in the world to protect that security that is so important to this country			0
" @entity33 's other big task will be trying to deal with the competing goals of protecting @entity98 's military superiority and drastically reducing the @entity36 's $ 550 billion annual budget			1
the former @entity101 chief of staff and budget director in the @entity104 administration said he is committed to finding that balance			0
new men , new missions at @entity36 and @entity108 he called it " a time for hard choices			2
" " it 's about ensuring that we are able to prevail in the conflicts in which we are now engaged , " @entity33 said			2
" but it 's also about being able to be strong and disciplined in applying our nation 's limited resources to defending @entity98			1
" @entity33 emphasized that " none of this will be easy , " and administration officials say privately this is a major reason why the president was so heavily focused on picking experienced old hands to round out the new ( ish ) national security team , with gen. @entity126 nominated to replace @entity33 at the @entity108			1
while some critics have dismissed the changes as a game of musical chairs , it 's worth noting the people filling those chairs are heavily respected on both sides of the aisle			0
when was the last time you heard a @entity138 touting the " honesty and integrity " of an @entity3 nominee as @entity143 chairman @entity142 , @entity144 , did ? " while i 'm sorry to see mr. @entity33 go ( from the @entity108 ) , his talent and leadership will be put to great use leading the @entity36 , " @entity142 said			1
" mr. @entity6 is leaving huge shoes to fill at the @entity36 , and i ca n't imagine a better candidate to replace him			0
" there has also been praise for the selections from republicans like sen. @entity155 of @entity156 , a senior member of the @entity157 who will vote on the nominations of @entity33 and lt. gen. @entity159 , who has been nominated to replace @entity126 as the allied commander of the war in @entity15			1
@entity3 also nominated the highly respected @entity163 to serve as the new @entity98 ambassador in @entity15 ahead of the july deadline that is fast approaching , which the president has held up as a pivot point for starting to bring home @entity98 troops			1
besides being experienced , many of these players know each other very well			0
when the war in @entity16 was falling apart , it was then - president @entity176 's decision to install @entity126 as the commander on the ground and @entity163 as the @entity98 ambassador in @entity181 -- with @entity159 serving under @entity126 on the military side -- that was one of the pivotal moments that got the mission back on track			1
" i mean @entity126 and @entity163 were the ' @entity185 ' in @entity16 , " @entity49 said			1
" these guys have all worked together			0
" that is significant because an administration can sometimes waste months and months getting key players to gel			0
" it provides the opportunity to get things done because you do n't have to waste your time in transition , " said @entity49			0
the time needs to be used wisely to tackle all of the challenges the team will face in the next year and a half , including nothing short of the most momentous transformation of the @entity98 military in a couple of decades			1
@entity204 : why @entity33 , @entity126 are smart choices " we are about to embark on the next big defense drawdown , " @entity49 said			1
" @entity33 is uniquely qualified because he was at the @entity101 during the last big drawdown in the early 1990s			2
" indeed , @entity33 served as @entity101 chief of staff and the budget director during the @entity104 administration and helped balance the federal budget			1
he was able then to benefit from his previous tenure as chairman of the @entity215 , and he will be able to draw upon that deep reservoir of respect again now			0
" i am pleased that my friend @entity33 will bring his long record of service , first in @entity223 and then in both the @entity104 and @entity3 administrations , to the job of secretary of defense , " said senate majority leader @entity218 , @entity219			1
" director @entity33 is taking the helm at a crucial time for the @entity36 , in the midst of two wars and as we close in on our july deadline to begin the drawdown of troops from @entity15			1
we need the kind of experienced leadership he can provide			0
" the budget battles ahead will only be further complicated by the 2012 campaign , of course , as both parties trade charges and potentially move farther from compromise			1
and if @entity3 ends up losing the race , the clock is ticking on @entity33 to leave the administration 's imprint on the @entity36 budget for the next decade to come			2
@entity3 , of course , hopes to win a second term			0
and just as @entity6 jokingly thanked @entity3 for " inviting me to stay on -- and on and on , " the president seems to already be lobbying @entity33 to stay beyond the next 18 months			2
at the @entity5 event , @entity3 noted that after 40 years in public service , @entity33 had wanted to go home to retirement with his wife			0
" @entity33 , i know that you 've been looking forward to returning now to @entity260 and your beautiful @entity261 , so i thank you for taking on yet another assignment for our country , " @entity3 said , adding with a sly smile : " and i hope you do n't have a clock			0

defense analysts say time is of the essence in sorting out security resources
the budget battles ahead will only be further complicated by the 2012 campaign
his choices of @entity33 and @entity126 to new positions have *bipartisan* support
@entity126 , @entity163 and @entity159 worked together to turn around @entity98 fortunes in @entity16
