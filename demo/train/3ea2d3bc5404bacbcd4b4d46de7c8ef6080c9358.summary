-- this week , the @entity1 released its newest study on the rate of autism among 8 - year - olds , showing that 1 in 88 has some form of the disorder			1
previously , it was 1 in 110			0
does the new figure indicate that we are seeing an epidemic of autism , as some have speculated ? at this point , it 's not clear			1
one possibility is that we are seeing the result of better detection rather than a real surge in autism			0
however , there are some striking parts about the study , which used data from 2008 collected in 14 sites across the @entity26			1
the rate of autism increased by more than 45 % from 2002 to 2008 in numerous sites			1
it was a larger and more consistent increase than from 2002 to 2006			0
also intriguing is that the increase was very uneven in terms of geography , gender , race and ethnicity			1
some sites had nearly five times as many children with autism as others			0
in several sites , almost 1 in 33 8 - year - old boys were diagnosed with autism			0
this seems difficult to believe , particularly when these sites had smaller samples and children with less severe intellectual disabilities			0
one wonders if some sites became part of the study because of a long - term commitment to autism services , and this had drawn certain families to live nearby , resulting in an increase in the frequency of diagnoses made by local medical centers or educational programs			1
but since the children did n't just meet the @entity1 study criteria for autistic characteristics -- 80 % of them had autistic diagnosis from community physicians -- it may be that there is truly a higher rate of autism			1
granted , the children were not actually seen by @entity1 researchers , so it 's possible that the methods of diagnosis varied among the sites			1
so , what are the implications of the study ? the @entity1 researchers are aware that it 's critical to identify the sources of variability in their data			1
for example , why were nearly twice as many children diagnosed with autism in @entity88 than in @entity89 or @entity90 ? if the rates are really increasing , does it mean that many more children , particularly those from ethnic or racial minorities who are often missed , could have autism and we just do n't know yet ? if we do a better job of identifying children with autism , the rate will certainly continue to increase			1
how do we address this issue , which is not unique to autism ? @entity104 , director of the @entity105 , commented that the most useful approach right now is to assume that there is an increase in autism and try to figure out why this is happening			2
since we know the disorder is a neurobiological condition , could it be caused by environmental factors ? many researchers are trying to find out			2
regardless of all the unanswered questions , we should keep in mind that autism is a common condition			0
more children need autism services than ever before			0
we need cost - effective ways to identify the disorder at early ages , provide adequate support and work with affected families to help their children transition to adulthood			0
for families concerned that their child might have autism , it 's important to be persistent in seeking help			1
the study suggests that children with autism in some parts of the country are much more likely to be recognized than in other parts , so seek the best resources possible and do not give up until you are sure			2
it may be that your child does not have autism since the disorder overlaps with various other common conditions such as delayed language ability and attention deficit disorder			2
far more children do n't have autism than do			0
with world autism awareness day coming up on monday , there are many reasons to hope for a brighter future for children and adults who have autism			0
despite the concerns about rising autism rates , more services and treatments are available , and they will get even better			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

a new *government* study shows that rate of autism has increased
@entity166 : it 's striking that increase is uneven in terms of region , gender , race and ethnicity
she says researchers are trying to find out the reason behind rising rate
lord : for families that may have a child with autism , be persistent in seeking help
