at first blush , @entity0 seems comically ill - suited in the role as ardent seducer of fetching actresses			2
and in many respects the astonishing allegations of his secret love trysts are like the improbable plot of a door - slamming @entity10 farce			0
@entity0 's alleged sexual escapades , revealed by the gossip magazine " closer , " are buzzing through the @entity10 media and burning up @entity14 streams gushing with shock , sniggering and outrage that so much attention is being devoted to something so irrelevant to affairs of state			1
yet , at a time when the @entity10 are tired of reading how depressed they are , claims of @entity0 's bedroom romp may well be a welcome distraction			1
it may even help him in the polls			0
@entity0 is nonetheless threatening legal action against " @entity30 " for privacy invasion			2
that gesture itself is extraordinary for two reasons			0
first , @entity0 has not denied the affair with 41 - year - old actress @entity36 --- the magazine has pulled its article from its online edition under pressure from @entity36 's lawyers , but says that does not mean its claims are inaccurate			1
@entity10 's first lady hospitalized after report of @entity0 's affair ' bizarrely comical ' second , in the past @entity0 's predecessors in the @entity47 -- notably @entity48 and @entity49 --- never had to worry about the @entity10 press reporting their feminine conquests			1
until recently , a media omerta protected the private lives of @entity10 politicians from the kind of intense scrutiny that @entity58 and @entity59 politicians are well accustomed			1
if the " closer " photo spread is accurate , @entity0 's secret assignations with @entity36 were bizarrely comical			1
he was allegedly slipping out the back door of the @entity47 , hopping on a scooter and buzzing through the streets of @entity65 on his way to @entity36 's apartment			0
there 's a claim that presidential bodyguard brought croissants to the love nest in the morning			0
touching , perhaps , but not very presidential if true			0
one can only imagine how @entity0 's official companion , @entity75 , reacted to reports of such assignations			1
@entity75 met @entity0 when she was a reporter for " @entity79 " magazine			1
he left his long - time common - law wife , @entity80 -- the mother of his four children -- for @entity75 before the 2012 presidential election			2
according to the claims in " @entity30 , " it would seem he may now have replaced @entity75 with @entity36 , though @entity75 still occupies one wing of the @entity47			1
' time - honored tradition ' in that respect , @entity0 would be adhering to a time - honored @entity10 tradition of official mistresses stretching back to the @entity91 kings			1
@entity92 fell under the influence of the @entity94 , who was his " favorite " at court			0
a century later @entity97 was an indefatigable seducer of alluring courtesans			0
in the @entity101 , @entity100 was an infamous womanizer ; and @entity103 famously died in 1899 while enjoying the lascivious attentions of his mistress in the @entity47			0
the corpulent and affable @entity0 may have learned the hard way that , unlike his political mentor @entity48 , he can not count on media complicity about his personal indiscretions			2
he could have realized that while watching @entity111 's personal crises fill the headlines			0
when the former @entity10 president 's wife @entity113 left him for another man , " @entity79 " published a photo of @entity113 and her new boyfriend			2
and when @entity111 began courting the fashion model @entity119 , their romance was all over the press , much of it stage - managed by @entity111			0
@entity10 vs. @entity59 media traditionally , @entity10 and @entity59 media behavior regarding the private lives of public figures have been a study in contrast			1
the standard explanation is that the @entity10 media never reported on private lives because the @entity10 simply do n't care about the personal vices of their leaders			1
the @entity137 press , on the other , have shown a prurient interest in private vices to pander to a pervasive " @entity142 " culture in @entity141 and @entity58			0
this may explain why @entity59 politicians caught with their pants down tend to confess and resign --- or in some cases wheel out wife and children and apologize abjectly , then resign under pressure shortly afterwards			0
in @entity10 , by contrast , politicians tend to sue and stay in office			2
if @entity10 politicians can count on @entity156 indulgence in their vices , the law is also on their side			2
that changed when @entity160 -- who was favored over @entity0 as @entity162 candidate for the @entity10 presidency -- was arrested in @entity164 for sexual assault			1
at first the @entity10 media establishment was stunned			2
the old omerta rules did n't apply in this case			0
not only was a criminal act alleged but it was alleged to have taken place in @entity141 , where different media laws and attitudes applied			2
many in the @entity10 establishment fulminated against @entity137 press abuses in sensationalizing the @entity160 scandal , but the fact is that the @entity10 media jumped in			0
with the @entity0 sex scandal , the @entity10 political establishment is predictably coming to his defense and condemning the tabloid excesses of " @entity30			1
" but again , it has n't stopped the mainstream @entity10 media from covering the story			0
legal differences beyond @entity137 vs. @entity10 cultural differences , the law is another factor			0
while there are distinctions between @entity59 and @entity58 law , generally speaking the press can report on private lives if claims can be proved to be true			1
@entity10 law , by contrast , is indifferent to truth			0
in @entity10 , protecting personal privacy trumps the truth			0
in @entity10 numerous politicians and celebrities have successfully sued gossip magazines for violating their privacy			1
in most cases , however , damages awarded are relatively modest			0
" @entity30 " magazine -- even if it loses a lawsuit brought by @entity0 -- will likely pay a small fine compared with the huge profits from newsstand sales of the alleged @entity0 sex scandal edition			1
@entity10 law , even if strict on privacy matters , is increasingly becoming irrelevant with the explosion of social media networks such as @entity14 and @entity220			1
@entity10 courts have no extra-territorial jurisdiction over anyone tweeting , posting and commenting outside of @entity10 about @entity0 's sexual escapades			2
even in @entity10 , it 's impossible for @entity0 , or any other public figure , to bring lawsuits against everyone who has violated their privacy on @entity14 or @entity220			1
the alleged @entity0 sexual scandal proves that the old media omerta rules and predictable legal gesticulations do n't work anymore in @entity10			1
it 's a new game with new rules .			0

closer magazine has alleged @entity0 is having an affair with actress @entity36
@entity0 , who was elected president in 2012 , lives with partner @entity75
@entity242 says a media omerta that protected politicians ' private lives is ending
and he says @entity10 privacy laws are increasingly irrelevant in the social media world
