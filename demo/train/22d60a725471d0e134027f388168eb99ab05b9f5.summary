-- @entity1 gives everything her all -- even lip - syncing			1
the oscar winning actress gave a showstopping performance in 2013 's " @entity6 , " but there 's one scene that we 're just now getting to fully appreciate			2
in the @entity12 dramedy , @entity10 plays @entity13 , a ' 70s housewife with a penchant for belting out the era 's hits while scrubbing down her home			0
in the movie , @entity10 sings along to @entity20 ' " @entity19 " with such fervor it left us wishing she had a second career as a cover band frontwoman			0
but it gets even better : it turns out @entity10 also filmed a scene with @entity30 's 1969 track " @entity31 " as the song of choice			1
the sequence did n't make it into the final film , but the dvd / @entity37 , released on march 18 , includes extended outtakes like this one : clearly , we 've been approaching housecleaning in the wrong way			0
it seems it 's best done with solo dancing and the most sincere lip - syncing this side of a pop star 's concert			1
@entity10 may have lost out on a best supporting actress @entity49 for her " @entity6 " role -- that went to @entity51 for " @entity52 " -- but she 's won the internet with this performance .			0

@entity1 gives a *powerful* performance in " @entity6 "
in a *deleted* scene , she was just as good lip - syncing @entity30 's " @entity31 "
the sequence is included in the dvd / *blu* - ray *version* of the film
