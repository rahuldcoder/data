-- when pop sensation @entity2 recently provided the grand finale to the @entity5 with @entity6 , a top slot on @entity9 television , it signalled that @entity11 's entertainment industry had broken out of @entity12 and is now looking to make it big in the west			1
just days after making their first appearance on @entity9 network television with their hit single " @entity24 " , the band of nine telegenic women this week returned to @entity20 -- where tickets for a 2011 concert sold out in 15 minutes -- to sing on prime time television			1
korean films , soap operas and " @entity28 " music idols , many of which were modelled on @entity32 's own sugary " @entity31 " , have taken @entity12 by storm over the past decade			1
but the hallyu -- or " korean wave " as the phenomenon is known in @entity12 -- is now spreading to @entity37 and the @entity9 , and spurring @entity11 's export earnings			1
cultural exports -- including films , comics and computer games -- hit a record $ 4.2bn last year , up from $ 2.6bn in 2009 , causing the share prices of leading entertainment studios to soar			1
even @entity11 's favourite cartoon character , the @entity46 , has appeared on television in 120 countries			1
@entity49 - jin , a government representative who coined the phrase @entity28 for @entity53 bands in a previous incarnation as a journalist , said the spread of @entity53 music had surpassed his highest hopes			1
" it was my old heroes like @entity61 who famously played @entity63			0
now to see @entity2 there is amazing , " he said			0
while @entity11 has been an export powerhouse for decades in electronics , ships and cars , manufacturing companies have rarely played up their @entity53 brand identity , fearing until recently they would be seen as inferior in quality to @entity75 rivals			2
cultural exports are , however , giving the once reclusive country a global cachet for the first time , shaking off the war - torn images of the @entity9 comedy @entity83 broadcasting exports such as television dramas hit $ 252m last year , up from $ 185m in 2009 , according to government statistics			1
music earned $ 177m , soaring from only $ 31m in 2009			2
film exports earned $ 26m , up from $ 14m in 2009			2
until recently , hallyu was seen as an @entity12 phenomenon			2
a 2003 drama called " @entity92 " about a female doctor at a 16th - century royal court proved a huge hit from @entity96 to @entity97 , and has more recently come to eastern @entity37			0
@entity12 is still crucial and the most effective managers continue to target export markets there			2
park jin - young , the impresario who runs @entity102 , created the band @entity104 with two @entity53 and two @entity106 singers , so they can record their hits in both @entity53 and @entity108			0
@entity2 sing in @entity53 , @entity109 and @entity75			0
" the next phase is for the music industry to introduce western singers to globalise the boy and girl bands further , " said @entity110 , president of the @entity111			0
@entity117 have been surprised by the enthusiasm for @entity28 in the west , where @entity53 culture receives scant attention in mainstream media			0
@entity53 newspapers splash photographs of packed @entity20 concert halls or @entity127 fans greeting @entity2 with signs in @entity53			0
these @entity37 fans have largely discovered @entity28 through social networking sites , @entity131 and @entity132			0
many commentators have also observed that @entity28 's novelty to outsiders comes from the years of training -- sometimes in tough quasi-boot camps -- that stars endure to ensure their songs are accompanied by immaculate group choreography that is rare in other pop music			1
while cultural exports are a source of national pride , @entity117 are also calling for improved regulation of the industry			1
the suicide of @entity148 , a soap starlet , in 2009 , focused attention on hallyu 's dark underworld where some performers are locked into slave contracts and are told to sleep with managers to win roles			0
