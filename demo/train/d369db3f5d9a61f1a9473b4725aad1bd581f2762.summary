-- @entity1 is emerging as an emotionally acute , not to say eviscerating , observer of the middle - class intelligentsia , the kind of people who write letters to " the @entity7 " and might plausibly pop up in a @entity9 movie			1
unlike the @entity10 , @entity1 does n't show his face on screen , but his films are no less personal for that : " @entity20 " was a sometimes wincingly autobiographical account of two boys torn between their divorcing parents , and he 's not one to deflect an insight with a wisecrack			1
the cracks just cut deeper			0
i 've rarely experienced an audience recoil from a character as passionately as they did to @entity27 's toxically self - absorbed writer in " @entity29 " ( maybe her best performance , incidentally )			1
these are comedies in the sense that the characters are painfully ridiculous -- and all too recognizably real -- but @entity1 sure does n't make it easy for himself , or us			2
@entity35 ( @entity36 ) is another neurotic narcissist , a middle - aged loner who comes back to @entity39 to house - sit while his brother enjoys a long vacation in the @entity42			1
@entity35 ( only his brother calls him @entity43 ) can feed the family dog , but the truth is that he desperately needs to regroup and recharge after a spell in a mental hospital			0
he has one friend , @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , who still has time for him and a wider circle of former friends who do n't			0
we soon learn that @entity35 used to front a band , but it fell apart after he turned down a recording deal , and he 's been in @entity55 ever since , under - achieving on a permanent basis			2
" i 'm trying to do nothing for a while , " is how he explains himself to anyone who will listen			0
@entity36 finds a note of defiance in this pathetic rationalization ( along with his powerlessness , @entity35 has developed an angry streak ) , but it 's clear to almost everyone how lost he really is			1
he 's living in the past , fantasizing about his old girlfriend ( a deftly ironic cameo by @entity1 's wife , @entity69 ) and scarcely able to look after himself , let alone his brother 's dog			1
it 's hard to believe this hunched misanthrope grew up in sunny @entity74 -- he can barely doggy - paddle and always dresses for rain -- but @entity36 knows him inside out			1
he shows us someone trapped in his own disappointment , flailing and failing			0
then there 's @entity82 ( @entity83 ) , his brother 's personal assistant / nanny , a wannabe singer who defaults to doormat status in almost any social exchange			2
@entity35 throws himself on her with an awkward mixture of condescension and vulnerability , and their fumbling relationship -- physical but scarcely intimate -- serves as a kind of love story , or at least the unspoken promise of one			0
it 's crucial to @entity1 's strategy that @entity83 ( a mainstay of the new millennial @entity105 independent scene ) is ordinarily beautiful , not movie - star knockout			1
@entity82 is self - conscious and unsure of herself , which is why she 'll drive @entity35 around ( he does n't drive ) even after he 's walked out on her twice			2
uneventful ( the dog gets sick , and , uh , that 's about it ) , " @entity35 " resembles the kind of films @entity83 has been making ( " lol , " " @entity114 " ) , but on a bigger budget and with one of @entity118 's most accomplished cinematographers on board ( @entity120 , whose credits include " @entity122 " and " milk " )			0
that is , it coalesces around tentative , half - formed ideas about how to be a person in the world			1
" @entity35 " shows that young people are n't the only ones wondering what they 're to make of themselves and whether it 's already too late			0
its best sequence , the climax , is an impromptu house party in which @entity35 finds himself pontificating , stoned , before a bemused audience half his age -- and at long last manages to accept himself			0
it 's a small victory but worth savoring .			0
