the assistant was one of about 30 health professionals in @entity2 who helped to treat the @entity3 patients			1
the news came amid growing fears in the @entity39 that the disease could spread			0
" as i 've said from the start of this outbreak , i consider this a top national security priority			1
this is not just a matter of charity ... this is an issue about our safety , " president @entity48 told reporters monday			1
he called for protocols to help stop the spread of the disease , while downplaying the risk of an epidemic in the @entity39			0
" we 're also going to be working on protocols to do additional passenger screening , both at the source and here in the @entity39 , " he said			0
" here in the @entity39 , at least , the chances of an outbreak -- of an epidemic here -- are extraordinarily low			2
" @entity67 gov. : quarantines at borders to avoid an outbreak , the federal government should start enhanced screening and quarantines at borders , @entity67 gov. @entity70 said earlier monday			2
" there 's only so much that a state can do , " said @entity70 , whose state is the first to have a patient diagnosed with the disease inside the @entity39			2
@entity80 flew into the @entity39 last month from @entity81 , the country hit hardest by the epidemic			0
he was coming to visit family and friends			0
after his @entity3 diagnosis at a @entity87 hospital , @entity80 now lies in an isolation unit in critical condition			1
he is receiving brincidofovir , health officials said monday			2
the experimental antiviral drug was originally developed to treat life - threatening viruses including smallpox			0
but antiviral drugs can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases			0
" we appreciate and we applaud the assistance we 've received from the @entity101 and other federal agencies we 've worked with , " he said			1
but , he added , " @entity103 needs to take immediate steps to minimize the dangers of @entity3 and other infectious diseases			1
" @entity112 " should immediately be directed to conduct enhanced screening procedures , obtaining more information about people who are coming from affected areas , " and taking " appropriate steps " as simple as taking a person 's temperature , @entity70 said at a news conference			1
the procedures " will also necessitate fully staffed , prepared quarantine stations wherever people are entering the country , ready to care for anyone whose screening turns up a concern , helping to prevent contagions from entering this country , " he said			0
@entity70 also announced the signing of an executive order creating the @entity126 on @entity127			0

freelance cameraman @entity146 , who contracted the virus while covering the epidemic in @entity4 , arrived for treatment in isolation at @entity151 on monday			1
his father , @entity152 , said he had tried to dissuade his son from going to cover the outbreak			2

@entity146 was strong enough to walk off the plane , said dr. @entity157 with the hospital			0
doctors are evaluating his condition			0
@entity39 troops set to deploy to @entity4 : will they be safe ?

they include thermometer checks for fever , something @entity4 authorities are already doing			1
but finding the right passengers to screen is not so simple			0
direct flights from @entity3 - affected areas are rare			2
travelers typically take flights that connect through other countries			0
" then they come here , so that makes it more of a challenge , " the official said			0
and even if @entity80 had undergone a temperature screening , it would have turned up negative			0
many people with @entity3 have no symptoms at first			2
who 's in charge of stopping @entity3 in the @entity39 ? so while the @entity101 is considering enhanced screenings at major @entity39 airports , according to a @entity101 official , there are no concrete plans			1
" we 're looking at all of the options			0
we want to do something that protects @entity39 , not something that either is done for show or something that wo n't have an impact , " @entity101 director dr. @entity200 told @entity208 's " the lead with @entity207 , " when asked about what new protocols could be put in place			1
@entity200 spoke shortly after meeting with @entity48 and other senior leaders to discuss next steps			1
officials want to make sure that new screenings would be worth potentially disrupting air travel and that they would n't unintentionally increase the risk of spreading the disease			0
" the question that 's being considered now and readdressed is that , should there be entry screening of some sort ? " said dr. @entity220 , of the @entity221			2
" if you do implement it , what would it look like and what would be the resources that are necessary to implement it ? " opinion : protecting against @entity3 trumps personal liberty			2
