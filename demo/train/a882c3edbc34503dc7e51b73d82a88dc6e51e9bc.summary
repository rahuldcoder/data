-- let 's assume you live in @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity5 , and you go to @entity6 for a vacation			0
while in @entity8 , you spend some money in the casinos			0
gambling is illegal in the state where you live , so should the cops in your home state be able to track your activities and arrest you for what happened in @entity6 ? the answer , needless to say , is no. or at least it should be no. common sense tells us that state laws should only apply to things that happen inside a state 's borders			1
but this sensible principle is being tossed out the window by the @entity27 , which has approved a proposal that would give states the ability to impose their taxes on out - of - state sellers			1
many people think this is a debate about " taxing the @entity36 , " but that 's a misleading characterization			0
if a merchant in your state makes an online sale to you or your neighbor , that seller will collect the sales tax levied by your state			1
and if a merchant in another state makes an online sale to you or your neighbor , that seller is subject to any taxes imposed by the state where it is based			2
but some governors and state legislators do n't like this system because many states do n't bother imposing any tax on sales to out - of - state consumers			1
and even if states levied taxes on sales to out - of - state consumers , what about the five states that do n't have any sales tax ? would n't those states become " tax havens " for internet sales ? for these reasons , some politicians fret that the @entity36 will put competitive pressure on them to keep their sales tax rates from getting too high			1
people generally shop online because of convenience , not tax savings			0
but it 's also a good thing when states are forced to compete with each other			0
states with no payroll income taxes , such as @entity6 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , help restrain the greed of politicians in states that have punitive income tax systems , such as @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
and if politicians in the high - tax states refuse to adjust their bad tax policies , then people should have the freedom to escape and earn income in other states			2
the same principle applies to sales taxes			2
if politicians in , say , @entity109 are worried that consumers will go online or travel across the border to avoid the punitive sales tax , then they should reduce their sales tax rate			1
politicians can choose to maintain uncompetitive tax systems , of course , but they also should be prepared to accept the consequences			0
i do n't think @entity94 and @entity95 should try to become the @entity119 and @entity120 of @entity121 , but that 's something for the voters of those states to figure out for themselves			2
in any event , they should n't have the right to force out - of - state sellers to act as deputy tax collection officials if they decide to impose bad tax policy			2
but this debate is n't just about tax policy and the proper limits of state government power			2
the bill still must go through the @entity136 , where the @entity137 is divided on the issue			0
if politicians in @entity142 approve the so - called @entity143 , they 'll not only be authorizing extraterritorial tax enforcement , they 'll also be setting in motion the creation of a database that will erode privacy for consumers and create opportunities for identity theft			0
this is because the legislation only can be enforced if governments set up some sort of system for tracking where consumers live , what they buy and how much it costs			0
with 9,600 sales tax jurisdictions in the @entity121 ( cities and counties also impose sales taxes ) , this is a compliance nightmare			1
and it means that your personal and financial details will be collected and stored in a database that will be a magnet for criminals and hackers from all over the world			0
to be blunt , a sales tax cartel is bad news for tax policy and bad news for privacy			1
let 's limit the power of state governments so they can only screw up things inside their own borders			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

the @entity27 approved of a bill that will require online *retailers* to collect sales taxes
@entity185 : state laws should only apply to things inside a state 's borders
he says some politicians fear that without internet sales tax , consumers can find havens
@entity185 : we need competition between states ; we do n't need a sales tax cartel
