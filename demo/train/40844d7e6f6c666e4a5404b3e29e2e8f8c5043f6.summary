@entity0 -- tuesday 's @entity3 address will be watched closely not only for what is said , but also for who will there in person to hear it -- especially the black - robed members of the @entity10 @entity9			1
at least one member of the bench , justice @entity12 , has publicly stated he will not attend after the dramatic criticism leveled at a court ruling by president @entity16			1
one or more justices have attended the annual speech to @entity19 and the nation in recent decades			2
court members are not required by law to be there , but custom has dictated their appearance , mostly for show			0
they are a key , if low - key , part of the pageantry , and are compelled to sit politely and stoically amid the often high - spirited partisan rhetoric and response of the event			0
there is no word yet from the high court on who will attend			2
invitations are sent to each chamber , and the justices have individual discretion as to whether to go			0
when they do , they wear their traditional judicial robes , are escorted into the @entity46 chamber as a group and take prominent seats up front , joined by other officers of the court such as the marshal and clerk			0
justices @entity54 and @entity56 have been regular attendees			1
government sources say justice @entity59 , who joined the bench in 2009 , is expected to be there , and so is the court 's newest member , justice @entity62 , on the job since august			2
democrats last year cheered the president when he dressed down high court conservatives in last january 's @entity3 address			1
@entity16 criticized the majority ruling in @entity71 , issued a week earlier , which removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections			1
" with all due deference to the separation of powers , " @entity16 said , " the @entity9 reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections			1
" @entity12 , sitting just feet away in the audience , shook his head and mouthed words interpreted as " not true			2
" he had been a regular at previous addresses , but in october 2010 he told an audience in @entity93 that he felt " like the proverbial potted plant " at such occasions and would not be attending in the near future			0
the 60 - year - old justice also , with a smile , noted that his colleagues " who are more disciplined refrain from manifesting any emotion or opinion whatsoever			2
" most of the intrigue over who will attend his year 's speech centers on chief justice @entity107 , who has labeled the political atmosphere at last year 's address " very troubling			1
" @entity107 , who turns 56 next thursday , said last march that partisan rhetoric and gestures aimed at the court left him questioning whether his colleagues should continue to attend			1
" it does cause me to think whether or not it makes sense for us to be there " he said			0
" to the extent the @entity3 has degenerated into a political pep rally , i 'm not sure why we 're there			1
" @entity46 press secretary @entity121 responded quickly with an indirect attack on @entity107 , saying " the only thing troubling " was the @entity71 ruling itself			1
during the 2010 address , members of @entity19 sat just behind the justices , many applauding loudly when @entity16 made his remarks about the court 's election spending case			1
sources close to @entity107 have said he has grown increasingly " frustrated " at what he views as the growing partisanship aimed at the federal courts , particularly the @entity9 both @entity16 and vice president @entity135 -- when they were senators -- voted against @entity107 and @entity12 during court confirmation proceedings			1
some justices have been regular no - shows at the @entity3 , including @entity140 , who stepped down from the court last year			0
@entity107 ' predecessor , chief justice @entity142 , also rarely appeared in person			1
another more vocal no - go is justice @entity144 , who has compared the televised @entity3 to " cheerleading sessions			0
" " i do n't know at what point that happened , but it has happened , and now you go and sit there like bumps on a log while applause lines cause one half of the @entity19 to leap up while [ another line ] causes the other half to leap up , " he said last november			0
" it is a juvenile spectacle			0
and i resent being called upon to give it dignity			0
" @entity144 , a generally verbose and animated jurist , said bluntly : " you just sit there , looking stupid			0
" @entity54 , on the other hand , has crossed the street to attend every @entity3 but one since joining the court in 1994			1
he missed president @entity165 's last annual address in 2000 because of the flu			2
many believe the justices have go to such events , that it 's just another unwanted chore of office			0
not so , @entity54 told @entity1 in 2005			2
" people attend if they wish to attend			0
i do wish to attend , so i go			0

president @entity16 *condemned* a @entity9 ruling during last year 's speech
in the wake of that speech , justice @entity12 has said he wo n't attend this year
chief justice @entity107 last year *derided* the " pep rally " atmosphere
justice @entity54 , however , said he *enjoys* attending and will again
