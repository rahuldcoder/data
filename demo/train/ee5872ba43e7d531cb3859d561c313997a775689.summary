the details were revealed tuesday at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			0
the @entity0 government outlined eight possible locations of the port -- one in @entity12 , one in @entity8 and six in @entity13 , despite the independence referendum which @entity13 holds in september			0

it already contributes $ 19 billion ( Â£ 11.3 bn ) to the economy each year , supporting nearly 35,000 jobs , " @entity0 business secretary @entity17 said			0
until now , the @entity0 had limited its involvements in space programs , launching rockets from @entity24 rather than constructing its own facility			1

" we have now created a shortlist of locations for the first @entity0 spaceport			2
" he added : " my benchmark is to ensure the @entity0 space sector is growing faster than the @entity46 economy "			2
the news is a reflection of growth and confidence in @entity0 space companies			2
one such group , @entity52 , recently announced a revolutionary new design for a pilotless reusable spacecraft , and intends for this to take off and land like planes , offering an indication of the consumer experience as and when plans come to fruition			0

" in addition , international leaders in space tourism @entity81 and @entity83 would also be expected to make use of the new base , with @entity87 having expressed interest in a @entity0 site			1
the growing competition and infrastructure should see the price of a trip to space decline sharply from the current $ 204,000 quoted by @entity81 , with flights to launch from @entity96 later this year			2
prices could fall by as much as 80 % ahead of the 2018 launch of the @entity0 spaceport , according to the @entity101 board			1
