@entity0 -- a gaffe is when a politician is caught telling the truth , the old saying goes			0
so it was in march when a hot microphone picked up president @entity8 telling his @entity10 counterpart , @entity9 , that he will have " more flexibility " if he wins re-election in november			1
the president 's top aides scrambled to downplay the remark , assuring reporters @entity8 does n't have any surprises up his sleeve should voters hand him a second term			1
but underlying the president 's comment is a truism of @entity25 politics : without the specter of a looming election , a second - term president is liberated to pursue policies that are n't politically tenable at the ballot box			1
what 's more , an @entity8 win in november would provide an opportunity for the president to claim a mandate to press forward full - throttle with policies @entity38 have spent the last two years deriding			1
" he 's going to try to pick up everything he did n't get the first term and he will certainly try to use whatever mandate he has going forward , " said @entity39 , a conservative columnist for the @entity40			1
moreover , an @entity8 win would be a stinging defeat for @entity38 who currently view the president as extremely vulnerable			1
the result may be a rethinking among @entity38 ranks on @entity52 about how to proceed			1
" republicans will be under a huge amount of pressure to be conciliatory , " said @entity53			0
the last two presidents are instructive : upon winning re-election narrowly in 2004 , president @entity58 declared that he had " earned political capital			0
" he spent the following months attempting to shepherd through an unpopular overhaul of @entity62 , a measure so unpalatable that members of his own party forced him to drop it			0
after his easy re-election in 1996 , @entity69 immediately proposed a massively priced children 's health insurance bill and a significant increase in education spending ( he got both )			2
so when vice president @entity76 said over the weekend that he supports same - sex marriage -- a position the president has inched steadily toward but not yet backed full - bore -- conservatives and political observers alike took it as a sure sign @entity8 himself will embrace the issue if his next four years are secured			1
" if you ask me , his position is a lot like what he said to @entity9 at the open mic in @entity93 , " said former @entity87 gov. @entity86 on tuesday			0
" i think the @entity25 people deserve to know today where president @entity8 stands today and where he will stand next year on this issue			1
" so what else do @entity38 think may result from an unbridled @entity8 ? many @entity38 @entity1 spoke with pointed to taxes first			1
the president himself has made no secret he wants to raise taxes on @entity25 households making more than $ 250,000 a year			0
but some @entity38 fear that 's just the beginning			1
" eventually the structural budget and deficit will have to get addressed , and his solution is likely to be a tax increase on the middle class , " @entity53 said			2
the @entity111 maintains @entity8 wants to overhaul the tax code , keeping rates steady for middle - and lower - income @entity25 while closing corporate loopholes and instituting a minimum tax on those making more than $ 1 million			1
but @entity8 has offered few details on the dazzlingly complex undertaking			2
" there is uncertainty around the president 's tax policy that scares fiscal conservatives " said @entity120 , a conservative commentator who worked in the @entity121			2
" he has to deal with taxes right away and he does n't know how he 's going to do it , " said @entity127 , a former aide to @entity121 minority leader @entity128			2
republicans also predict a massive increase in spending should the president get a second term , starting with health care			0
many of the law 's reforms do n't kick in until 2013 , promising a hefty price next year if the measure is n't modified			0
" right now there are just budget gimmicks to pay for it , " said @entity127 , " he has to figure out how to pay for it			0
and he 's shown no will to reform entitlements			0
" " there is a sincere fear that our economy will collapse if @entity8 stays in office because of spending and entitlements , " added @entity148 , a conservative blogger for @entity149			2
uncertainty over business regulations is also causing unease			0
@entity38 argue one of the reasons the recovery has been so sluggish is the uncertainty around increased regulations			1
presumptive @entity38 presidential nominee @entity165 has vowed to repeal the @entity166 , the @entity167 reform measure signed into law by @entity8 in 2010			1
particularly irksome is that the bill bestowed considerable power to rule - making agencies , like the newly established @entity172			0
should @entity8 win , he 's likely to leave the act untouched			1
" republicans worry that not amending certain provisions of @entity166 will stall the recovery , " @entity175 said			0
on the foreign policy front , critics say @entity8 could go soft on missile defense in @entity93 and allow @entity182 to strengthen its stature			2
" @entity182 and @entity10 will continue to be emboldened , " said @entity175			0
of course , these doomsday scenarios are to be expected in election year politics and the president himself makes similarly unsettling predictions about what a @entity165 presidency would bring			0
meanwhile , @entity111 aides say climate change , energy reform and an immigration overhaul are on the top of the president 's list for term no. 2			2
but one issue in particular has some conservatives especially wary : the @entity201			0
with three justices well into their 70s , it 's likely there will be at least one retirement in the next four years on the high court , possibly from the conservative bloc			0
" this is what many @entity38 thought - leaders are most concerned about , " said @entity148			1
" they have lifetime appointments			0
it 's the most powerful way @entity8 can leave his mark			1

a second term would allow @entity8 to push forward with agenda
@entity76 's same - sex marriage comments *fueled* speculation about @entity8 's view
@entity38 think @entity8 would push tax increases in second term
new regulations are a target of @entity38 if they prevent second @entity8 term
