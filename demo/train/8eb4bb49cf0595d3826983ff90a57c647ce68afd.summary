-- a human rights group issued a new report detailing the widespread practice of female circumcisions in @entity5 , calling on @entity7 authorities to outlaw it			1
the 73 - page report , released wednesday by the group @entity10 , cites previous studies estimating the circumcision rate for young women to range from 41 percent in a smaller sample of women up to 80 percent in larger studies			1
the @entity7 government does not keep statistics on female circumcisions or post-operative medial consequences			2
@entity10 refers to the circumcisions as " female genital mutilation			1
" the procedure involves partial or total removal of the clitoris , and is also known as clitoridectomy			0
the report describes the pain , fear , and physical and emotional distress that girls experience as they undergo the procedure			1
although @entity33 does not mandate female circumcisions , some girls say it comes from the belief that anything they touch is unclean " until they go through this painful procedure , " according to the group			2
critics say the intent is to oppress women , and to curtail female sexual desire , even if the surgery poses a health risk			1
the report , entitled " ' they took me and @entity50 in @entity5 , " describes the pain and fear the girls and young women endure as they undergo the procedure , and the physical and emotional distress suffered afterward			1
it calls on the semi-autonomous @entity55 to ban the practice			2
" fgm violates women 's and children 's rights , including their rights to life , health , and bodily integrity , " said @entity57 , @entity59 women 's rights researcher at @entity10			2
" it 's time for the regional government to step up to the plate and take concrete actions to eliminate this harmful practice because it simply wo n't go away on its own			0
" the authors interviewed @entity73 , 22 - year - old @entity7 married woman , in 2009			0
" i was five , " said @entity73			0
" my mother took us , me and my sister , to a midwife , and i ran away			0
they [ later ] held me by force and removed a piece of flesh from my body			0
they opened up my legs , and it was very painful			0
they put water and then ash on the wound			0
" the report says the previous regional government in @entity5 decreed that anyone performing female circumcisions should be arrested and punished , but @entity10 says it found no evidence the law is being enforced			1
the group acknowledged it wo n't be easy to change long - existing mindsets and traditions			0
" eradicating it in @entity5 @entity5 will require strong and dedicated leadership on the part of the regional government , including a clear message that @entity60 will no longer be tolerated , " @entity57 said .			1
