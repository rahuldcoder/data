@entity0 , @entity1 -- imagine @entity1 's urbanization drive as @entity4 on steroids			1
the core objective of the video game is to build a metropolis while staying on budget and keeping residents happy			0
@entity1 has done it on a massive scale over the last three decades , but with disappointing results			1
for starters , inefficient spending has spawned @entity1 's empty mega malls and " ghost cities " of headline lore			1
and in those urban areas problems abound			2
@entity1 's city dwellers are forced to live in a severe concrete landscape of polluted skies and chronic gridlock			1
" you 've got 500 million people that have moved to the cities since 1980 , " says @entity24 , @entity25 - based author and chairman of the consultancy @entity27			0
" the lives they 've been able to build , it 's been incredible			2
but the question is : ' can they make it livable ? ' " @entity1 's urbanization drive started decades ago when 80 % of the population lived in the countryside			1
today , @entity1 has more than 160 cities with populations of a million or more , with an urban population of around 700 million that represents more than half the total population			1
and yet , despite all the thoughtless construction and chaotic urban planning , @entity1 has managed to dodge at least one bullet : there are no miles of urban slums			1
there are no favelas dotting @entity1 's cities			1
@entity1 's newest urban residents -- its migrant workers -- have jobs to sustain themselves			1
but they are not entitled to the social benefits in the cities they work in			0
" there are 260 million people who already have jobs ( in the cities ) , " says @entity59 , economic adviser to @entity1 's @entity61 and former chief economist of the @entity63			1
" but they do n't have the social welfare yet			0
" @entity1 premier @entity68 says he wants @entity1 's urbanization drive to focus more on human needs and to be friendly to the environment			1
his top priority ? urban social welfare reform			0
" @entity68 's new urbanization drive is mainly addressing those already in the city who are not fully integrated to the cities -- those not fully entitled for urban social welfare , " says @entity59			2
the government recently announced planned reforms of the household registration system , or " hukou , " to gradually allow qualified migrants to receive benefits like education and healthcare in their new homes			0
" slowly , starting from small cities to medium towns then to larger cities , they 're loosening up the registration requirements , " says @entity90 , founder of @entity91 , a @entity0 - based non-profit dedicated to sustainable development in @entity1			2
" in certain cities like @entity0 you can have a points system to actually buy into the hukou system			0
" @entity1 is taking small steps toward complete reform by 2020 because of specific concerns about the impact of a fully opened hukou system			2
" this is very sensitive , " @entity59 tells me			0
" for those people who already have an urban hukou , they may sell it if a market exists			0
" and for those who have n't got urban citizenship yet , if they sell ( their rural land ) and suddenly lose their job , they have no place to go			0
so the government is very cautious about this			0
" if land reform moves too quickly , @entity1 will lose its unique buffer for unemployment -- the migrant workers ' rural homes , where they can always go back to if they lose their jobs			1
an unemployed migrant population lingering in the cities poses a threat to stability			2
that is @entity25 's fear			0
but on the other hand , the government acutely feels economic pressure to provide migrant workers with social benefits in their new homes			1
" the current economic model of state planning , state banks , state industry and all these mega projects is running out of gas			0
if they have got to keep growth going , it 's going to be consumers and so this is all about creating consumers , " says @entity24			0
" the great social justice story of @entity1 is in order to grow you have to turn these migrants into full citizens and consumers			2
" @entity1 's high - stakes version of @entity4 has reached a new level			1

half of population now lives in cities , but push to urbanize has had mixed results
@entity1 has empty malls , " ghost cities , " *traffic* gridlock and dire pollution
however , @entity1 has *avoided* urban slums and migrant workers have jobs
@entity1 's *challenge* is to make cities more liveable
