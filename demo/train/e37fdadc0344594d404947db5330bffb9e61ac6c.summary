@entity0 -- declaring victory in @entity6 's @entity5 presidential caucuses on saturday , @entity2 again turned away from his @entity5 rivals and toward president @entity8			1
@entity1 projects that @entity2 will win the @entity6 @entity5 presidential caucuses , based on results and entrance polling			2
with 71 % of the votes counted , @entity2 held about 48 % of the vote , while former house speaker @entity15 had 23 % and rep. @entity16 had 18 %			1
former @entity18 sen. @entity17 , who had largely bypassed the state , had 11 % of the vote			1
those numbers were gathered from vote counters at caucus sites across the state and the state 's @entity5			0
see full @entity6 results @entity2 thanked supporters at his campaign headquarters in @entity0 , telling them , " this is n't the first time you gave me your vote of confidence , but this time i 'm going to take it to the @entity36 , " alluding to his win in @entity6 in 2008			2
but then he turned his attention to @entity8 , saying @entity6 has had enough of his kind of help in fixing its home mortgage crisis and that he failed at bringing down unemployment			2
entering the race as front - runner , @entity2 had largely ignored his @entity5 rivals and focused on @entity8			1
but as @entity45 rose to challenge him in polls , he was forced to address the other candidates in the race			1
his victory speech was a one - on - one with @entity8			1
" this president began his presidency by apologizing for @entity52			0
he should now be apologizing to @entity52 , " @entity2 told cheering supporters			2
the only allusion to @entity5 opponents @entity2 made was when he told supporters that he was the only one who could fix the economy , " unlike other people running for president			2
" rather than the traditional post-vote speech , @entity45 held a news conference in which he accused the @entity2 campaign of spreading rumors that he would drop out of the race , calling it " their greatest fantasy			1
" @entity45 reaffirmed his commitment to stay in the race , saying , " we will continue all the way to @entity72 , " where the @entity73 will be held in august			1
@entity45 aides had said that he would outline a new campaign strategy that would be more positive			2
but while his tone with reporters was cordial , the message was n't			0
although he called his opponent a " @entity90 moderate " instead of a " @entity91 " as he has in the past , @entity45 said he believed he was the alternative to @entity2 , " who has in his career been pro-abortion , pro-gun control , pro-tax increase , and who ranks third from the bottom in creating jobs in the four years he was governor			1
" @entity45 downplayed the @entity6 results , pointing out that @entity2 , a @entity93 , did well in " a very heavily @entity93 state , a state which he carried in 2008			1
" he said @entity16 has a " substantial advantage " in any caucus state because of his organization			2
@entity45 said he wanted to run a more positive campaign , but that negative attacks were part of the game			2
" i stayed relentlessly positive in @entity103 , and i lost by 22 points , " he said			0
" i think it 's terrible the @entity52 system is reduced to negative ads , some of them false			0
" " but it 's a fact , if you 're not willing to stand and fight , you have to get out of the race			2
" @entity45 said he intends to compete for the @entity5 nomination in every state and will be matching @entity114 in the polls by the @entity117 primary on april 3			2
" in a few more weeks i 'll be ahead in @entity118 again , " @entity45 predicted			1
@entity2 's @entity6 win makes him the first @entity5 candidate in this cycle to score back - to - back wins			1
the former @entity90 governor appeared to win in the @entity103 caucuses , but the contest was later awarded to @entity17 when the vote was certified			0
@entity2 scored a big win in @entity128 but was then stunned in @entity129 by @entity45			1
@entity2 scored a 14 - point victory over @entity45 and the rest of the field in tuesday 's @entity134 primary and entered saturday 's contest with a sizable lead in polls			1
the caucuses were open only to the state 's more than 470,000 registered @entity5			0
@entity6 's 28 delegates will be awarded proportionately based on the statewide vote			0
polls leading up to the vote had shown @entity45 trailing far behind @entity2			1
at one point , in the wake of his poor showing in the @entity134 primary , @entity45 advisers said he would concede the state and look down the road to more friendly states that vote in the march 6 super tuesday contests			2
but ultimately he chose to campaign in @entity6 and did n't appear to make up much ground on @entity2			0
as the votes were being counted , a leading @entity2 backer in @entity6 was calling for @entity45 to drop out of the race instead of continuing to divide the party			1
@entity6 rep. @entity158 , who has been closely allied with @entity2 since his 2008 presidential bid , said the results of the caucuses should be a wake - up call for @entity45			1
" i hope he takes the message that it 's time to withdraw gracefully and not continue to divide the party , " @entity158 told reporters in @entity0 , shortly before the first caucus results were announced			0
while @entity2 's campaign and his network of supporters have voiced concerns about @entity45 's threat to remain in the race for the long haul , there has not yet been a chorus of @entity5 leaders publicly asking him to drop out			1
@entity158 was not as insistent , however , when asked if @entity16 should also bow out for the good of the party			0
@entity16 should quit when it becomes apparent that there is " enough critical mass in terms of delegates , " he said , probably sometime after @entity185			0
establishment @entity5 fear that the longer the campaign goes on , the more the vitriol between @entity45 and @entity2 will result in a damaged nominee and give @entity189 ammunition from @entity5 themselves			1
@entity45 is n't expected to do well in the contests in february , but he could rebound on @entity185 , where he 'll find friendlier voters in contests in @entity194 , which he represented in @entity195 , @entity196 , and @entity197			1
the former @entity36 speaker 's stunning victory in the @entity129 primary -- in which he erased @entity2 's double - digit lead in polls two weeks before the vote to win by double digits -- propelled @entity45 to the lead in national polls			1
but @entity2 and groups that support him bombarded @entity45 with negative ads and attack stump speeches , questioning everything from his ethics to his mental stability , and toppled him going into @entity134			1
asked saturday night about the @entity2 campaign 's tactics , @entity2 's son @entity213 said there were no regrets within the campaign about @entity2 's criticism of his rival			2
politics is " a tough sport , " @entity114 said			0
while @entity2 and @entity45 spent caucus night in @entity6 , both @entity16 and @entity17 are looking ahead to tuesday caucus states -- @entity16 to @entity224 and @entity17 to @entity225			1
@entity226 also votes in a nonbinding primary on tuesday			0
asked about how long his campaign could run , @entity16 said even if he wanted to drop out of the race ahead of the convention , he could n't because there would be a " strong rebellion with my friends			1
" " but we 're doing so well there 's no reason to think about that , " @entity16 added			2
campaigning in @entity225 , @entity17 told @entity1 that he expects to win one of the three events next week in @entity225 , @entity224 and @entity226			0
" i expect to win the nomination , " @entity17 said			0
" i feel very good about how it is going			0
this race is a long way from being over			0
" the @entity6 could almost be considered home - field advantage for @entity2			0
he won the caucuses here four years ago in his first bid for the @entity5 nomination , grabbing 51 % of the vote , far ahead of @entity16 , who was in second place at 14 %			2
@entity2 won the endorsement thursday of real estate mogul and reality tv star @entity252 , who last year flirted with his own bid for the @entity36			0
@entity252 is a well - known figure in @entity0 and his outspoken criticism of @entity8 has made him popular with some tea party activists and grass - roots conservatives			0
the state 's strong tea party movement should have been @entity45 's trump card in @entity6 , but supporters seemed divided between @entity45 , @entity16 and @entity17 -- who landed the endorsement of @entity263 , the @entity265 - supported @entity5 @entity264 nominee who came close to unseating senate majority leader @entity266 in the 2010 midterm elections			1
the division of tea party supporters only helps @entity2			0
@entity45 started up operations in @entity6 much later than @entity2 and has been playing catch - up since			1
he does have some major allies in the state , including billionaire casino magnate @entity274 , who along with his family has contributed millions of dollars to an independent @entity277 super pac			0
the @entity6 wo n't be in the rearview mirror of presidential politics for too long			0
@entity6 is a battleground state in the general election , having voted for the winning presidential candidate 10 out of the last 11 elections			0
@entity8 beat @entity283 by 12 points here in 2008			0
@entity1 's @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 contributed to this report			0

in victory speech , @entity2 again focuses on @entity8 rather than rivals
@entity45 says he 's in race for the *duration* and predicts he 'll be *competitive*
