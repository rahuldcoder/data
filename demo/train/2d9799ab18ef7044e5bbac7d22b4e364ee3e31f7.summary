-- just 12 years after the arrival of the 6 billionth individual on the planet in 1999 , humanity will greet the 7 billionth arrival this month			1
the world population continues its rapid ascent , with roughly 75 million more births than deaths each year			1
the consequences of a world crowded with 7 billion people are enormous			1
and unless the world population stabilizes during the 21st century , the consequences for humanity could be grim			2
a rising population puts enormous pressures on a planet already plunging into environmental catastrophe			1
providing food , clothing , shelter , and energy for 7 billion people is a task of startling complexity			1
the world 's agricultural systems are already dangerously overstretched			2
rainforests are being cut down to make way for new farms ; groundwater used for irrigation is being depleted ; greenhouse gases emitted from agricultural activities are a major factor in global climate change ; fertilizers are poisoning estuaries ; and countless species are threatened with extinction as we grab their land and water and destroy their habitats			2
the economic challenges are equally huge			2
@entity46 is growing most rapidly in the world 's poorest countries -- often the places with the most fragile ecological conditions			0
poor people tend to have many more children , for several reasons			0
many live on farms , where children can be engaged in farm chores			0
poor societies generally suffer from high rates of child mortality , leading parents to have more children as " insurance " against the possible deaths of children			0
girls rarely make it to high school , and are often married at a very young age , leading to early childbearing			0
and modern methods of contraception may be unavailable or unaffordable			0
when poor families have six or eight children , many or most of them are virtually condemned to a lifetime of poverty			0
too often , parents lack the wherewithal to provide decent nutrition , health care and education to most of them			0
illiteracy and ill health end up being passed from generation to generation			0
governments in poor countries are unable to keep up , their budgets overmatched by the need for new schools , roads and other infrastructure			0
so the arrival of the 7 billionth person is cause for profound global concern			1
it carries a challenge : what will it take to maintain a planet in which each person has a chance for a full , productive and prosperous life , and in which the planet 's resources are sustained for future generations ? how , in short , can we enjoy " sustainable development " on a very crowded planet ? the answer has two parts , and each portends a difficult journey over several decades			1
the first part requires a change of technologies -- in farming , energy , industry , transport and building -- so that each of us on average is putting less environmental stress on the planet			1
we will have to make a worldwide transition , for example , from today 's fossil - fuel era , dependent on coal , oil and gas , to an era powered by low - carbon energies such as the sun and wind			0
that will require an unprecedented degree of global cooperation			0
the second key to sustainable development is the stabilization of the global population			1
this is already occurring in high - income and even some middle - income countries , as families choose to have one or two children on average			0
the reduction of fertility rates should be encouraged in the poorer countries as well			1
rapid and wholly voluntary reductions of fertility have been and can be achieved in poor countries			2
success at reducing high fertility rates depends on keeping girls in school , ensuring that children survive , and providing access to modern family planning and contraceptives			1
two centuries ago , the @entity166 thinker @entity165 famously warned that excessive population growth would cut short economic progress			1
that is a threat still with us today , but it is a warning , not an inevitable outcome			0
we face an urgent task : to adopt more sustainable technologies and lifestyles , and work harder to achieve a stable population of some 8 billion or so by mid-century , rather than the current path , which could easily carry the world to more than 10 billion people by 2100			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity184 : @entity187 's population will hit 7 billion this month ; *milestone* , huge challenge
he says with earth 's resources already stretched thin , rapid growth is cause for concern
he asks : how do we increase opportunities for all , leave a usable planet for future ?
*sachs* : vital to switch to sustainable technologies , cut fertility rates
