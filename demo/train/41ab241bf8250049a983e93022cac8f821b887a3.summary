@entity0 , @entity1 -- six years ago an ad in the sunday paper changed a young @entity1 woman 's life and made aviation history			1
seven @entity1 women are trained to fly the country 's f - 7 fighter jets -- though none have seen combat so far			1
the ad read : " @entity13 recruiting females cadets			0
" back then @entity15 was 20 - years old and living in @entity16			1
her mother wanted her to be a doctor			0
she remembers her reaction when she told her she wants to fly			2
" she was like : ' you 're a girl , ' " says @entity20			0
" how will you do it ? how will you fly ? " the following day @entity20 took the first step in proving her mother wrong			2
she was among the first in line at the recruitment center			0
for nearly six decades it was only men who had flown @entity1 's fighter jets			1
today @entity20 is one of seven women who are trained and ready to fly @entity1 's f - 7 supersonic fighter jets			1
" this is a feeling that makes you proud and makes you humble also , " says @entity20			0
humility does n't mean lack of confidence			0
" we can do everything better than the men , " explains cadet @entity39			0
" we 're more hardworking , more consistent and more patient , " adds cadet @entity43			0
to become a fighter pilot takes three years of training at the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity1 , where the halls are lined with grainy black - and - white pictures of nearly six decades of male graduates who went on to fly for the @entity13			1
the training is often intensely physical			2
here , equal opportunity means equal treatment			0
if they are not good enough as per their male counterparts , we do n't let them fly , " says commanding officer @entity57			2
some of @entity1 's female pilots wear hijabs			1
others prefer to go without the @entity62 headdress			1
most say changing the misconception of @entity62 women is just as important as serving their country			1
" @entity67 gives equal opportunity to females			0
whatever we want to do we can , " says pilot @entity69			2
" to tell you the truth i 've been given equal opportunity or i suppose more than men have been given , " says @entity13 cadet @entity71			0
@entity13 officials say fighter pilots are playing a vital role in the fight against the @entity79			2
they 're training in counterinsurgency , collecting aerial intelligence and targeting militant strongholds in the treacherous mountains of @entity1 's tribal region along the @entity86 border			1
@entity15 says her goal now is to fly in combat			1
" i would give my life for my country , " she says			0
but women rarely fly in combat anywhere in the world and it 's never been done in @entity1			1
it 's another barrier @entity20 plans to break .			0
