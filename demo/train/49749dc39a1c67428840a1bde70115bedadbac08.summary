-- cue the faux - surprise			0
female - targeted films " a fault in our stars " and " @entity5 " wiped the floor with the competition , forcing @entity10 's more teenage boy - friendly " @entity9 " into a third - spot opening			1
women made up a staggering 82 percent of the opening - weekend audience for the adaptation of @entity17 's @entity16 novel about teenage cancer patients -- comparatively , " @entity20 's " initial audience was only 75 percent female			2
the film made $ 48.2 million , vaulting it alongside " @entity22 " in the firmament of emotionally and financially resonant weepies			1
that 's less than the $ 56 million " divergent " made its first three days out , but that other @entity28 - starring @entity16 adaptation cost a whole lot more			1
of course , " @entity31 's " success will probably level out in the coming weeks once the film 's steadfast fanbase decides that their eighth bawl - filled screening is enough			0
( it was a 52 percent drop from friday to saturday alone			0
) but even considering just this weekend , the adaptation is an unqualified success for @entity38 and stands as more not - quite - shocking evidence that when you target movies at a demographic that 's typically underserved -- particularly in the summer months -- you can reap pretty big dividends			2
especially when that demographic represents half of the world 's population			0
' @entity47 ' : are those tears of joy , critics ? another female - driven success , " @entity5 , " dropped only 52 percent to snag second place with $ 33.5 million			1
with a two - week total of $ 127.4 million , the film is lagging behind other @entity57 - heavy @entity56 reboots like " @entity58 " and " oz : the @entity64 and @entity65 , " both of which featured " @entity5 " director @entity62 as their production designer			1
but with a strong international gross and still yet to open in the major @entity70 markets , the @entity67 - starring fairy tale looks to be headed for a more - than - comfy global total somewhere in the half - a - billion range			0
despite good reviews and @entity10 's 100 - watt smirk , the sci - fi action flick " @entity9 " disappointed with $ 29.1 million , $ 8 million less than the similarly packaged " @entity76 " did last year			1
directed by @entity78 , the film stars @entity10 as a pr flunkey - turned - soldier who finds himself rebooting every time he dies			2
but even if @entity10 ca n't outsprint a pair of young cancer victims to the top of the @entity86 box office , he can still flex his @entity87 appeal overseas where " edge " took the no. 1 spot with a much healthier $ 82 million			1
' @entity9 ' : a new day for @entity10 ? " x-men : @entity92 " raked in another $ 14.7 million to make its total $ 189.1 million			1
in a superhero super-brawl , this means that " x-men " will almost definitely end up making more than " @entity95 2 , " but it 'll have to work pretty hard to top " captain america : the winter soldier			0
" meanwhile @entity104 's " @entity103 " continues to flounder after it had a hard time getting its gun out of the holster its first weekend			0
there were tumbleweeds in the movie theaters this week too , and its second - weekend gross of $ 7.2 million brings its total to a meager $ 30.1 million			2
it appears there is n't much gold in them thar hills			0
" @entity47 " — $ 48.2 million 2			1
