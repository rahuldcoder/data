@entity1 leader @entity0 was sworn in wednesday as @entity3 's new prime minister , following months of political uncertainty for the debt - stricken country			1
he was inaugurated at the presidential mansion after meeting with president @entity8 , who asked him to form a new @entity3 government			1
his swearing - in followed the news that three parties -- the center - right @entity1 , which placed first in sunday 's vote , @entity16 and the @entity17 -- had reached agreement on the terms for the coalition			0
the new government is expected to be sworn in thursday , state broadcaster @entity21 said			1
speaking as he left the presidential mansion , @entity0 said : " we trust that with @entity27 's help we will do all we can to get our people out of the crisis			1
i will ask the government tomorrow morning to work hard in order to be able to give tangible hope to our people			0
" @entity3 has been without an elected government for 223 days , and the new government , which has pledged to push for a renegotiation of the painful austerity measures imposed under the terms of an international bailout , will face significant challenges			1
the country is struggling to get out of the political and financial mire that threatens to drag down @entity44 's common currency and spark a new global financial crisis			1
@entity0 met with the heads of his two coalition partners , @entity16 leader @entity48 and @entity49 of the @entity17 wednesday evening , @entity21 reported			1
discussions continue on the government 's exact makeup , @entity48 said earlier , but it is not expected to include members of the two junior parties in senior cabinet posts			0
" @entity3 has a government			1
... that is the message that we need to send abroad , " @entity48 said as he announced the deal in a televised statement			0
the most critical issue for the new government is the formation of a national task force to renegotiate the terms of @entity3 's unpopular international bailout , he said			1
@entity3 will go to a two - day summit in @entity68 later this month determined to push fellow @entity44 leaders on the issue , he added			1
@entity48 said it is unfortunate that the anti-austerity party @entity71 , which placed second in the election , had declined to join the other parties in seeking the best way forward for the country			0
@entity1 , which broadly favors @entity3 meeting international debt obligations , led the talks on forming a coalition after narrowly taking first place in sunday 's election			1
the socialist @entity16 party placed third			0
what will @entity3 elections mean for the country 's future ? dr. @entity86 of the @entity87 at the @entity88 , said it is a positive step that @entity3 now has a government , but few details about key appointments or policies are yet known			1
the @entity94 will be dominated by ministers from @entity1 , after its partners said they would support the government but did not want to be part of it , he said			2
however , it may include a couple of technocrats from @entity16 and a representative from the @entity104			0
@entity48 's focus on the negotiating team that will seek to amend the terms of @entity3 's bailout deal , rather than the @entity94 , may signal his desire to be part of that team , @entity86 noted			2
an early test for the new government will be the @entity68 summit on june 28 - 29 , when it will seek to present a strong front to @entity44 leaders as it puts forward proposals on changing the terms of the loan agreement and new investment for growth , he said			1
while few specifics are known , all three parties are keen to renegotiate a provision under which @entity3 's current minimum wage of 750 euros a month ( about $ 950 ) would be cut by 22 % , @entity86 said			2
but , he said : " there 's no decision about how ( they ) actually deal with the immediate problems of acute poverty in parts of society and problems of tax collection			0
" he predicted that the international community will show patience with the new @entity3 government at least until september , not least because any alternative would be far more radical and anti-european			1
and while @entity0 has in the past been rather narrow in his views , @entity86 said , the politician has shown some leadership in recent days in making concessions to form the coalition			1
@entity49 announced wednesday morning that his party 's central committee would back the coalition government but that it wanted efforts made to ease the burden of austerity on the @entity3 people			1
" this support is connected to the political platform that will be decided			0
the @entity104 is insisting that this platform will contain commitments that will ensure the removal of measures that have gravely affected the @entity3 society			2
the country must have a government , but for us the substance of this government 's policy is the big challenge , " @entity49 said			0
the leftist party has supported bailouts from international lenders while seeking to renegotiate the terms			0
with almost all ballots counted , @entity1 had won nearly 30 % of the vote , the @entity171 said , giving the party 129 seats in the country 's 300 - seat @entity176			0
@entity71 , which campaigned against the terms of the bailout , got 71 seats			0
@entity16 , which long dominated @entity3 politics , won 33			2
four smaller parties took fewer than two dozen seats each			0
a wild election weekend for @entity3 , @entity185 and @entity186 @entity187 , the fiery leader of the leftist @entity71 party , met with @entity189 but said monday he would not back a coalition			2
" history and the people will judge them by their results , " @entity187 said of the parties backing some kind of bailout deal with the creditors who are keeping @entity3 afloat			2
" shortly we will be vindicated			0
" he said his party 's nearly 27 % showing had forced @entity3 leaders to realize the bailout is " nonviable , " and said @entity71 would press as a member of the opposition for the bailout to be scrapped in its entirety			2
the vote was widely seen as a referendum on whether @entity3 should remain tied to the euro , the currency used by 325 million people across 17 countries in @entity44			1
the possibility of a " no " vote roiled world markets , with some analysts warning that the collapse of the euro would cost $ 1 trillion			0
the future of @entity44 : 3 scenarios international bailouts have kept @entity3 from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue , but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange			1
some observers had predicted that efforts to renegotiate the bailout could lead to a run on @entity3 banks and deeper misery			2
the country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of june to be considered compliant with the terms of its bailout			0
after five years of recession , unemployment is running at about 22 % , taxes are going up and many of those with jobs are suffering cuts to wages			0
@entity251 chancellor @entity250 , @entity44 's powerful advocate for balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth , had urged @entity3 not to walk away from the international loan deals			1
" we will stick to the agreements			0
that is the basis on which @entity44 will prosper , " she said saturday .			0
