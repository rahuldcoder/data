-- the search for two missing hikers on @entity5 's @entity4 has moved from a search operation into a recovery operation , authorities said wednesday			2
" it was our hope that we might get a window today to take a last look , " @entity8 , @entity5 , sheriff @entity9 told reporters			0
" unfortunately , that has n't happened			0
" @entity16 , 24 ; @entity18 , 26 ; and @entity19 , 29 , set out about 1 a.m. friday on what was to have been a fairly easy " semi-technical " hike in which they would have descended the south side of the mountain , sheriff 's deputy @entity17 has said			1
@entity18 was found dead saturday from hypothermia			1
authorities said tuesday they were suspending the search , citing the threat of avalanches			0
@entity9 said wednesday the mountain was experiencing 60 mph winds and the weather is not expected to clear anytime soon			0
however , the @entity34 will continue to monitor weather conditions and will launch an organized recovery mission when conditions improve , he said			0
" @entity41 has given me a peace about @entity19 , " @entity39 's father , @entity38 , told reporters wednesday			1
" he 's given me strength			0
" " i think there needs to be a time of meeting with my family , and we 're going to talk , and we 're going to cry , and we 're going to hug one another , and then we 're going to turn around and praise @entity41 that we know @entity19 is in heaven , " he said			1
" we are confident ... she has led a life that 's been exemplary			0
" " this has not shaken our faith , " said @entity53 , @entity16 's father			1
" this has strengthened our faith			0
" on tuesday , authorities said there was little hope the two would be found alive			1
" could they be alive ? yes , " said dr. @entity62 , physician supervisor for @entity63 in @entity8			2
" is it very likely ? no. " a specialist in emergency medicine , @entity62 noted that " at about 48 hours -- two days -- the chances of finding somebody alive after that go down to about 1 percent			2
" operations coordinator @entity70 hypothesized that the hikers may have been involved in an accident and that @entity18 , the most experienced of the three , may have broken away from the others and begun to backtrack in an effort to seek help			1
above his body rescuers found a water bottle , a helmet , a harness , a camera and camera case and a mitten belonging to @entity39			2
" maybe @entity19 lost a mitten in an accident , " @entity70 said			1
if @entity18 did indeed seek to return for help and @entity39 lost one of her mittens in an accident , he may have left his gear , his pack and his supplies and gloves with her , taking the lone mitten , he said			1
but descending can be more difficult than climbing in some places			0
" if there was some form of an accident and @entity18 did downclimb , this is a much more difficult descent , " he said			1
@entity16 's home is @entity103 , @entity104 ; @entity39 's is @entity105 , @entity5			2
@entity18 was from @entity106 , @entity104			2
@entity4 rises 11,239 feet above sea level , with a base that stretches across 92 miles ( 148 km )			0
it is the highest mountain in @entity5 , a dormant volcano with steam constantly spewing from holes , according to the web site mthood.org .			0

" could they be alive ? yes , " expert says . " is it very likely ? no "
@entity16 , @entity18 , @entity19 , started hike about 1 a.m. friday
@entity18 was found dead saturday from hypothermia
he may have been trying to get help for others after an accident , searcher says
