-- remember that old tune " friday , i 'm in @entity3 " ? well , some daters are looking to make it a reality			0
" i have found a wonderful weekend lover , " reads a testimonial by " @entity8 , 38 " on the new dating website , parttimelove.co.uk			1
" he asks for no more , and the times we spend together are magical			0
" the site , launched in early january , is the brainchild of relationship author and blogger @entity16			1
its target demographic is people who want to be independent but also want to fall in love , she says			0
some may wonder whether @entity22 is simply the newest in a line of dating sites where users troll for one - night stands			1
but the site is n't just @entity28 with a romantic sheen , if you believe its marketing spiel			2
" we are not a no - strings website			2
we are for singles looking for regular partners with mutual attraction , genuine friendship , respect and a magical spark but whom have no expectations of moving in after three months and value their free time and independence , " claims the site , which users must opt into via other , more established dating sites			1
@entity16 asserts that a low - maintenance or part - time relationship is distinctively different than the eloquently named " booty call , " or the even more lucid " casual encounter " in that the goal is lasting love			1
@entity16 admits it 's not for everyone			2
she envisions her demographic as users in their mid-to - late 30s and early 40s who are set in their ways and might find it difficult to adapt domestically to a new partner			1
" they 're realistic on the fairytale , " she says			1
in 2011 , writer @entity60 wrote a column " we 're happily semi-detached " in a @entity65 newspaper about her part - time cohabitation with boyfriend , @entity69			1
she had just completed a difficult divorce -- " are n't they all ? " she joked in an e-mail with @entity0 -- and was n't sure she ever wanted to get married again			0
what she was sure of was that she and @entity74 worked really well together as the relationship stood			0
they were " living apart together , " as she called it			0
fast forward to 2014 , and now @entity60 is engaged to marry @entity74			0
" over time , @entity69 and i have become more and more sure that we are each other 's soulmate and life partner , " she says			1
" and we have slowly but surely got to the point where we are ready to make the ultimate commitment to each other			0
" but , that does n't mean they each wo n't have their alone time			2
the couple is planning for @entity74 to have a pied - @entity90 - terre , but not in the @entity92 sense			2
" as it is , it is totally workable , albeit somewhat unusual , " she says			0
" we are working out logistics at the moment , but i reckon we will live together and @entity69 will rent a work - live space nearby where he can write , sometimes sleep , and recharge his batteries			2
" @entity100 explores what she calls " low - maintenance relationships " in her new book " screw the @entity105 : a modern girl 's guide to @entity108 , " in which she debunks the traditional ideal of the omnipresent partner			1
@entity16 says she never wants to get married or have kids			0
( she 's also quite familiar with unorthodox dating styles ; her first book , " @entity114 , " was about her penchant for older men			1
) " you do n't have to see someone three to four nights a week to express love , " she told @entity0 over the phone from @entity118			0
" in every other aspect of life , we 've gone for convenience , independence and where individualism is promoted , " she says			0
" yet , you have this socially approved model of relationship that you live together			0
" @entity16 says for it to work , the partners ' emphasis is still on a genuine relationship , in that there is romance and sparks but " without all the monotony and obligation of a full - time relationship			1
" @entity141 , a @entity142 - based clinical psychologist and author of " @entity144 , wanting intimacy : why women settle for one - @entity151 " says this particular style of dating can certainly feel empowering as it allows daters to compartmentalize the relationship			1
" it protects you ; there 's less vulnerability , " she says			1
sooner or later , though , she says one or both partners might catch stronger feelings and want something more			0
" ultimately , what connects us with one another is being vulnerable , " she asserts			0
on the opposite end of the spectrum , @entity141 says it 's also important for each partner to feel like they have their own life			2
" you should feel safe and at ease in your relationship , " she says , meaning that you are n't constantly worrying where your partner is and vice versa			0
if that 's not the case , a conversation about space is in order			2
failing that , it might be time to re-evaluate the healthiness of the relationship			0
as for @entity100 , she 's still single and ready to mingle part - time			1
