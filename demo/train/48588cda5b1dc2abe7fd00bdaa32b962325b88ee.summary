@entity0 -- @entity2 on @entity3 are reeling after the midterm elections left them in the minority in both the @entity7 and @entity8			1
but do n't expect new faces to lead the party after the brutal election			0
@entity12 , the @entity14 leader in the @entity8 , and @entity15 , the top @entity16 in the @entity7 , are both expected to keep their leadership positions next year despite the election 's punishing losses			1
they 're both hanging on with the same expectation : 2016 will be a better year for @entity2 that could return them to the majority			0
@entity15 , a @entity25 @entity16 who was the first female @entity7 speaker , is already officially in the leadership race			1
in a letter to her colleagues on wednesday , @entity15 said election night was " difficult " for @entity2 but said there was more work for the party to do			1
meanwhile , people close to @entity12 say he hopes to remain the @entity34 for many years and is readying a run for a 2016 re-election bid in @entity37 to make sure that happens			1
" he has no desire to be a lobbyist or put his feet up and watch tv , said @entity41 , a @entity37 political journalist who tracks @entity12 closely			1
" he will not want to go out a loser and the 2016 map is much more favorable			0
" " based on everything i know and based on what he 's doing to get ready , i believe he 's going to run in 2016 , " said @entity44 , his former spokesman			0
" he 's a guy who ca n't keep still and is a legislator at heart			0
i could see him continuing for a long time			0
" @entity12 has led the @entity2 since 2005 and @entity2 have been in the majority eight of those years			1
some @entity2 privately grumble @entity12 could do more to work with republicans to compromise on tough issues			1
but he remains popular with senators in his caucus , many of whom he helped get elected , and they are loyal to him for that			0
now as minority leader , @entity12 will have to be the face of the opposition			1
he and sen. @entity64 , who is in line to become majority leader , have a notoriously sour relationship and that 's unlikely to change now that their positions are reversed			0
watch : @entity71 on the midterms but @entity44 said @entity12 might be willing to work with @entity73 and @entity7 speaker @entity74 , who leads the @entity75 , if they do n't try to pass " extreme measures			1
" " it 's going to be very difficult for sen. @entity73 to find the compromise necessary that brings along @entity14 votes , " @entity44 said			0
" at the end of the day , the president still has the veto pen , so if they want to get things done , they are going to have to deal			0
" even before the election , @entity15 signaled that she was more focused on 2016 than 2014			2
downplaying the midterms , @entity15 said her party would do " ok , " but then immediately began taunting @entity54 about 2016			2
" their days are numbered			0
i know that in two years , there will be a @entity92 and a @entity14 president the @entity7 , " @entity15 said			1
but now that @entity7 @entity54 have expanded their ranks to the largest @entity54 majority since the 1920 's , @entity15 told her colleagues in her wednesday letter that her party has to do a better job of boosting turnout			1
she said she planned to focus on a new project starting next week when @entity92 returns to increase voter participation			0
the challenge for 2016 definitely got more formidable for @entity15 , but few expect the 74 year old @entity15 to slow down			2
she has been a relentless fundraiser ever since she joined @entity7 leadership , and the war chest she amassed for her @entity14 colleagues helps her future job security			1
in the 2014 election cycle , she raised more than $ 100 million for @entity110 , and personally was responsible for raising over one - third of $ 172 million that the @entity111 raised for the midterms			0
in the last two years , @entity15 traveled to 115 cities and attended or participated in 750 fundraising or campaign - related events			2
@entity15 often points to one accomplishment in particular : @entity7 @entity2 for the first time in 2012 became a caucus made up of more female and minority members than white men -- a so called majority - minority caucus			1
but the @entity14 caucus that @entity15 joined in 1987 has changed dramatically and some of her closest allies in @entity92 retired this year			2
when fellow veteran @entity25 lawmakers @entity126 and @entity128 announced they would n't run for re-election , there was some speculation that @entity15 may decide to step down			2
many of the members elected in the last two cycles are younger , and they respect @entity15 's political skills , but privately some of them say they would like to see some fresh faces at the leadership table			1
@entity15 's number two , rep @entity138 , @entity140 , and her number three , rep @entity142 , @entity145 - @entity144 -- also in their seventies -- are expected to remain in their positions			2
@entity15 will get to add a new voice to her leadership group when she picks the next chair of the @entity111			1
the current chair , rep. @entity152 , @entity145 - @entity153 , said he does n't want another turn at the job , and at least three mentioned for the post are younger than those already in leadership -- rep. @entity159 , @entity160 , and rep. @entity161 , @entity162 , and rep. @entity163 , @entity164			0
with the loss of the few remaining moderate @entity167 , the caucus will skew more liberal			0
@entity15 publicly says she has a good relationship with @entity7 speaker @entity74 , but there are few issues where the two are likely to come together to produce bipartisan legislation			1
@entity15 hinted at her focus going into the next political cycle at a fundraiser featuring former secretary of state @entity176 in late october			2
" i am frequently introduced as the highest - ranking woman in political office in our country , " @entity15 said			0
" i 'd like to give up that title and elect a @entity14 woman for @entity183			0
" correction : an initial version of this story misquoted @entity44 .			0

*democrats* will be in the minority in the @entity7 and @entity8
@entity12 , @entity15 will continue in leadership roles
