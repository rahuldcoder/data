new census figures released thursday for @entity2 's white and black populations depicted a nation where most people are white , with increasing numbers of mixed - race inhabitants			1
while the number of white residents increased in the past decade , the total fell as a percentage of the overall @entity2 population , according to figures from the 2010 census			1
meanwhile , the number of black @entity2 increased , with those identifying themselves as being of mixed black and white descent more than doubling in the past 10 years , @entity15 officials said			1
most blacks continue to live in @entity23 states , though changing population dynamics appear in other parts of the country , particularly the @entity27 and the @entity28 , the census figures showed			0
of the total @entity2 population in 2010 of just under 309 million people , 231 million were white , or almost 75 %			2
a decade earlier , the white population was about 217 million , or 77 % of the almost 282 million total then			2
in addition , the white population grew at a slower rate -- 6 % -- over the past decade than the total population , which increased by almost 10 % , according to census officials			2
much of the 14 million increase in the white population -- 74 % -- involved whites of @entity40 origin , as the census distinguished @entity40 ethnicity from race			1
for example , respondents could identify themselves as white hispanics , black @entity47 or as @entity47 in any of the other racial categories			0
meanwhile , the number of whites not identified as @entity47 also increased in total from 195 million in 2000 to about 197 million in 2010 but decreased as a percentage of the total population , from 69 % in the previous census to 64 % in last year 's survey			0
" it 's not surprising that we 're seeing that the growth of the white population is due to hispanics identifying as whites , " said @entity55 , a statistician for the bureau 's racial statistics branch in the population division			1
people identifying themselves as mixed - race whites increased by 2 million over the decade			1
most of the increase was people who reported their race as both black and white , a group that rose to 1.8 million last year , compared with 785,000 in the 2000 census			0
the 130 % increase was the largest by percentage among any group or subgroup in the white or black populations , the census information showed			0
a total of 42 million identified themselves as black alone or in a combination with other races , comprising 14 % of the total @entity2 population			0
according to the latest census , white @entity40 populations showed the greatest increase in the @entity27 , parts of @entity87 , the @entity28 , @entity88 , @entity89 and the @entity90			0
black populations also increased in the @entity27 , @entity87 , the @entity28 , @entity89 and the @entity90 but decreased in many @entity23 states			0
despite those decreases , more than half of the black population still lived in the @entity23 , the 2010 survey showed .			1
