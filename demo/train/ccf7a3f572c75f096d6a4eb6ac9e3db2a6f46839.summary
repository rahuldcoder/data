-- @entity2 's premier has waded into an intensifying trade dispute with @entity4 , warning that @entity6 investigations into @entity2 - made solar panels and telecommunications equipment would backfire by hurting @entity4 consumers			1
" the cases over these two types of products will hurt @entity2 industries , business and jobs and also damage the vital interests of @entity4 users and consumers , " @entity10 said en route to @entity12 on sunday during his first foreign trip since becoming premier			1
" we express firm opposition			0
" mr @entity10 's comments mark the first time that @entity2 's top leadership has weighed in on the trade disputes , and come as the solar case -- the @entity6 's biggest ever trade investigation -- enters a critical phase			1
the @entity6 must decide before june 6 whether to go ahead with a proposal from @entity33 , trade commissioner , to impose provisional duties averaging 47 per cent on imported @entity2 solar products for dumping , or selling goods below cost			1
@entity6 member states were due to submit their reactions to the proposal by friday			2
as the deadline approached -- and even over the weekend -- those supporting and opposing duties stepped up their lobbying campaigns to try to win over undecided governments			0
on sunday the vote appeared to be on a knife edge , with several people close to the investigation claiming as many as 15 of the 27 member states had opposed the duties			0
the commission declined to confirm this , and the numbers appeared to be fluid			0
a spokesman for mr @entity33 said the commission would " take note " of member states ' positions			0
" at this stage , any potential temporary measures are an emergency response to rebalance the market place for @entity4 companies facing life - threatening dumping and unfair competition from @entity2 's solar panel industry , " he added			1
under @entity6 rules , the commission -- not the member states -- makes the final decision on provisional duties			2
imposing them without majority backing from national governments would be an embarrassment for mr @entity33 and weaken his hand as the investigation moves toward a final outcome in december			0
@entity79 , the @entity81 's minister for energy and climate change , led a group of energy executives to @entity85 last week to try to persuade the commission to drop the solar case			2
@entity87 , @entity88 's economy minister , has also weighed in , publicly urging mr @entity33 to negotiate a solution			0
@entity92 , vice-minister of @entity2 's ministry of commerce , is set to meet the commissioner in @entity85 on monday to discuss the solar case , as well as a pending @entity6 probe into @entity2 's telecommunications network equipment suppliers , @entity90 and @entity91 mr @entity33 was given a green light from fellow commissioners to open an investigation after informing them he believes both companies benefited from illegal government subsidies , including cheap land and financing , and then dumped their products in @entity4			1
mr @entity10 made his remarks ahead of a visit to @entity88 , @entity2 's biggest @entity6 trading partner and a potentially pivotal player in determining the outcome of the investigations			1
at a press conference in @entity12 on sunday evening , @entity88 's chancellor @entity113 said : " @entity88 will make every effort so that we make real progress in these talks			0
" mr @entity10 's remarks coincide with a comment piece in monday 's @entity0 written by @entity121 , @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity6 , accusing @entity85 of resorting to protectionism and remarking that its " repeated attempts to stir up trade frictions with @entity2 are astonishing and confusing "			1
mr @entity121 said the trade cases were counter-productive at a time when the @entity6 was still mired in recession and struggling to regain investor confidence			2
he also warned of broader damage to the bloc 's reputation , writing : " the commission 's actions have tarnished its image as an advocate of free trade , fuelled the rise of protectionism and run counter to the commitment by the leaders of the @entity142 group of industrialised nations not to introduce protectionist measures			0
