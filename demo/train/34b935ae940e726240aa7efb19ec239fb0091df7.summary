-- the blogging platform @entity2 -- which sits somewhere between @entity3 and @entity4 on the social media spectrum -- has become one of the more interesting places to watch the debate about the @entity10 protests unfold			1
on the @entity2 site " @entity17 , " people who sympathize with the @entity13 - based protest movement are telling first - person stories of hardship and unemployment			1
each post features a photo of its author holding up a paper sign that tells a bit of the person 's story and says " @entity17 , " a reference to the protestors ' concern that the top 1 % of @entity30 command much of the country 's wealth and power , leaving the rest to struggle			1
" we are getting kicked out of our homes			2
we are forced to choose between groceries and rent			2
we are denied quality medical care			2
we are suffering from environmental pollution			2
we are working long hours for little pay and no rights , if we 're working at all , " a blog introduction says			1
" we are getting nothing while the other 1 percent is getting everything			2
we are the 99 percent			2
" here 's one post from tuesday : " my mom worked on @entity49 for almost 30 years			1
in 2008 , when the market crashed , the company she worked for shut down			2
the @entity53 were taken care of , but all the loyal workers were left with nothing			0
my mom still has n't found work			0
i am the 99 percent			0
" and another : " i 'm a small business owner			0
i just bought new work computers so my colleague and i can do our jobs			0
now , i have no money for food for the next 3 days ( next paycheck )			0
i 'm always one check away from eviction			0
i 'm one of the ' lucky ones			0
' " on tuesday night there were 77 pages filled with similar stories , and about a half - dozen posts on each page			2
as attention for that @entity2 page grew , a competing blog with a more conservative ideology came into being			1
the conservative " we are the 53 % " @entity2 page says it represents the 53 % of @entity30 who must pay federal income tax ( most people who make less than $ 30,000 per year pay no major federal income taxes , according to a 2009 report from the non-partisan @entity84 , as @entity85 reports )			1
the assumption is that @entity10 protestors and sympathizers on the " we are the 99 percent " site do n't pay taxes			1
" i work 3 jobs			0
i have a house i ca n't sell			0
my family insurance costs are outrageous			0
but i do n't blame @entity49			0
shut it up you whiners			0
i am the 53 % subsidizing you so you can hang out on @entity49 and complain , " the introductory post on october 5 says			1
the 53 % blog was created by @entity99 , who also is an editor at the conservative site @entity101 , according to the @entity102			1
( @entity103 also is an occasional commentator for @entity0 )			0
the conservative @entity2 blog has six pages of posts , compared to 77 on the site sympathizing with @entity10			1
" i would love to hang out in in ( sic ) the park for a couple of weeks protesting the entitlement generation and radical egalitarianism , but i have a job to go to			0
go figure , " another post says			2
@entity2 has become the site of choice for people organizing the @entity10 movement , which started in @entity13 and has spread to many other cities in the @entity30 , writes @entity120 for @entity121			1
" the site has been a force behind the @entity10 protests , growing the number of demonstrations from just dozens of people in late september to thousands , " he says			1
at the @entity128 , @entity127 says the " @entity17 " @entity2 page is the digital equivalent of bathroom stall graffiti -- " allowing you to bear something private and maybe find someone else carrying around the same weight			1
" along with the @entity137 and @entity138 , the @entity2 account is part of an increasingly important medium called the " collaborative confessional , " she says			1
" this is self - service history , with no curator and no narrator			0
some of the stories call out for follow - up questions , but there is no one to ask them , " @entity127 writes			0
" the results are raw and rough , but demonstrate that , with or without a @entity151 , the power of personal narrative , whether on the radio , in a book , on @entity156 , or on a @entity2 , can cut through the noise and cynicism of punditry and give shape and texture to our national story			1
