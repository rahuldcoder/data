-- @entity1 -- the company known for decades for its cameras and film -- this week confirmed it used weapons - grade uranium in an underground lab in @entity6 for upwards of 30 years			1
a company spokesman and a former scientist for the firm say there was not enough material to sustain a nuclear chain reaction			1
former @entity1 researcher @entity14 said the uranium was alloyed with aluminum in plates sealed in sleeves that were not moved for three decades			1
the amount of fuel was about 3Â½ pounds , which experts say is less than one - tenth of the amount necessary to make a crude nuclear device			1
the alloyed material " could not be readily converted to make a nuclear weapon , " said @entity1 spokesman @entity25			1
" disassembling the device and removing these plates was a process that took highly trained experts more than a day to perform			1
" but advocates for preventing nuclear proliferation say it highlights the risk that terrorists could obtain enough fuel to build a nuclear device			1
" in this day and age , no one should be allowed to possess nuclear - weapons - usable material without providing an armed defense of that material , " said @entity39 , a nuclear physicist with the @entity41			1
" there really should be an effort to eliminate the use of materials in commercial companies that could be used by terrorists to make nuclear weapons , " he said			2
@entity1 turned the material over to the government in 2007 , under heavy security			1
but for more than 30 years , the company had a device called a californium neutron flux multiplier , or @entity60 , in a specially built labyrinth beneath @entity62 at its labs near @entity64 , @entity6			1
the device was about the size of a refrigerator			2
it was not a reactor , but rather a hunk of metal emitting radiation			0
its purpose was to create a beam of neutrons to use for scanning and testing other materials			1
the device 's primary source of neutron radiation was the radioactive element californium , but the stream of neutrons produced by the californium was multiplied by passing it through a lattice of highly enriched uranium @entity84 , whose nuclear fission released additional neutrons			1
according to a spokesman for the @entity91 , @entity1 's uranium was highly enriched -- to a level approaching 93.4 %			1
that is the type of weapons - grade material that @entity96 government agencies are trying to prevent terrorists from getting their hands on			1
( for the sake of comparison , @entity99 claims to have enriched uranium to 20 % , leading @entity104 nations to impose sanctions on the country in an effort to prevent @entity99 from pursuing further enrichment			0
) @entity39 acknowledges that the quantity was not enough to make a bomb			0
" but you can always imagine , " he said , " an adversary that was coordinated could steal enough in different areas to kind of consolidate , and have enough for a bomb			0
" while @entity1 did not have armed guards , @entity14 said that there were security procedures in place to prevent any unauthorized access to the uranium			2
also , he said , it would take hours or days for anyone to dismantle the @entity60 and extract the nuclear fuel			2
he also said the bunker was subject to regular inspection , never leaked radiation , and never posed any risk to the neighborhood of radioactive exposure			0
" the walls surrounding it were two feet of reinforced concrete			0
the ceiling over it was again two feet of concrete and then eight feet of earth			0
so it was really a well - shielded instrument , " he said			2
@entity1 says it never intended to hide the @entity60 , and it was licensed by both state and federal officials			2
but the fact that the company was handling highly enriched uranium was never widely publicized			0
there are 31 reactors in the @entity96 for research or testing purposes , according to the @entity91			0
most are run by universities and use low - enriched uranium rather than highly enriched uranium			0
but weapons - grade fuel is still used in some reactors , said @entity39			2
" the ( @entity154 ) reactor , and a ( university ) reactor in @entity157 , both still use highly enriched uranium			0
the @entity158 would like those reactors to change the way they operate , so they do n't have to use bomb material anymore , " he said			0
" but it 's technically hard , it costs a lot of money , and there 's resistance			0
" @entity0 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 turned the material over to the government in 2007
it was used in scanning and testing for more than 30 years
the amount of fuel was about three - and - a - half pounds
experts say that 's less than a tenth of what 's needed for a crude nuclear device
