@entity1 -- " it 's terrifying coming here but we 've decided it 's just a big pub , " @entity0 tells the audience at a packed @entity4 , assembled for the @entity7 and @entity8 star 's first concert in his own right at @entity1 's most prestigious music venue			1
he may be showing false nerves -- over the past 25 years he has developed into one of the most innovative musicians of his generation , has collaborated with the cream of the music world in a bewildering range of genres , and has the experience of headlining the world 's biggest music festival , @entity25 , twice -- but he seems genuinely humbled tonight in such grand @entity27 surroundings , paying tribute to this " ridiculously incredible , spiritual place			0
" @entity0 is showcasing his new album , " @entity32 , " his first as a solo artist			1
a more stripped - back work than usual for him , the songs look back on his 46 years			1
" @entity41 , " for instance , recalls various dates that define his life , including the drought of 1976 and the year 1993 when " @entity39 " ( a reference to @entity7 's second album ) was spray - painted around the city			0
reflective though his new solo work is , @entity0 is in playful mood and shows his love of performing and collaborating : he willingly shares the limelight with other musicians , such as @entity49 's @entity48 and @entity50 , @entity7 guitarist @entity51 , rappers @entity52 and legendary producer @entity54			1
the concert is about far more than just promoting his new record though : effectively it revisits many of the many musical moments of his long and varied career , from his foray into world music with @entity62 , his animation side - project @entity8 , supergroup @entity65 , and of course his first band , @entity7			1
despite his comments , @entity0 is such a seasoned performer that he 's totally at ease in the @entity4 's vast space			2
spontaneous , engaging and funny : holding hands with female members of the audience , singing directly to their faces			0
at one point he climbs up into the aisles to hug an adoring male fan -- it 's a poignant moment			0
he 's a master of pacing : stripped of the machismo of a @entity7 concert , or the graphical wizardry of @entity8 , the music is the star			0
he and his band are superbly tight , as we get one highlight to the next , from " @entity88 , " and " @entity89 , " to the spine - tingling experience of @entity0 alone at the piano singing @entity7 's " @entity92			0
" just when it can get no better , guitarist @entity51 bounces onto the stage to join @entity0			1
the pair , who had a painful estrangement as they battled their demons after the @entity7 years rollercoaster , roll back the years as they play " @entity103 , " accompanied with just a trumpet player			0
@entity0 visibly marvels at @entity51 's guitar heroics on " tender , " but acknowledges their split as they struggle to recall which year obscure b - side " the man who left himself " was from			1
" ah the late 90s -- our difficult years , " @entity0 half - jokes			2
as we wipe away the tears of nostalgia , @entity0 rallies us again : " it 's pure sing - a - long from now , " he bellows			2
the show is building like a cabaret , with quieter moments followed by crowd - pleasing anthems like his solo hit " mr. @entity123 , " performed with @entity1 's @entity124			0
then on come veteran @entity126 hip hop trio @entity52 who tear manically into the @entity8 hit " @entity128 , " swaggering around with dramatic menace , before @entity130 joins @entity0 for a superb , skanking " @entity131			2
" how could he top this ? @entity133 , as @entity0 announces -- only half - believing it himself -- the arrival of @entity54 , the legendary musician , composer and record producer , to sing the wonderful " @entity140 , " from this year 's album , with the @entity139 choir and @entity50			1
it 's an unforgettable experience , as indeed is the whole concert : few others could attract such diverse and entertaining stars to appear for one night ; few others have such wonderful songs to perform , and few can engage with an audience like @entity0			0
no one else can do all three			0
@entity0 no longer needs to be in awe of the musical legends who 've performed at the @entity4 over the decades -- he 's now one of them .			1
