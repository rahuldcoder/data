or under - skin implants as their preferred method of birth control may be on to something : according to a new study , these long - acting forms of contraception are 20 times better at preventing unintended pregnancies than the @entity13 and other short - term methods			1
the study , published this week in the @entity16 , compared the effectiveness of various types of birth control in a group of about 7,500 sexually active women in the @entity23 area			1
over a period of three years , 9.4 % of women using birth control pills , patches , or vaginal rings became pregnant accidentally , compared to just 0.9 % of women who opted for iuds or implants			1
the difference in these so - called contraceptive failure rates was especially dramatic among teenagers and young women , a group at high risk for unintended pregnancies			1
women under age 21 who used short - term birth control were nearly twice as likely as their older counterparts to become pregnant , whereas the failure rate for iuds and implants was less than 1 % regardless of age			1
" it 's not that birth control pills are n't effective , because they are -- when they 're used perfectly , " says @entity46 , @entity47 , a study author and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at @entity51 , in @entity23			1
" but humans are n't perfect , and it 's normal to forget to take a pill every day or file for prescription refills every month			0
" @entity0 : what 's the best birth control for you ? birth control pills , the method of choice for 28 % of @entity64 women , are the most commonly used form of reversible contraception , but their effectiveness depends on consistent daily use			1
nationally representative surveys have reported failure rates with the @entity13 similar to those seen in the current study			2
patches and rings require less attentiveness than pills , but they still leave room for human error			0
the birth control patch ( known by its brand name , @entity82 ) needs to be changed weekly , while the vaginal ring ( known as @entity84 ) needs to be changed once a month			2
by contrast , iuds and implants are designed to be foolproof			0
an @entity5 , a t - shaped piece of plastic inserted into the uterus by a gynecologist , can remain in place for five to 10 years			0
implants such as @entity94 and @entity94 , matchstick - size devices inserted below the skin on the upper arm that release a slow trickle of hormones , can last up to three years			0
despite being far more effective than pills , iuds and implants -- collectively known as long - acting reversible contraception ( @entity104 ) -- have proven to be less popular with women			1
according to the latest government data , just 5.5 % of women on birth control use iuds and less than 1 % use implants			1
@entity0 : the worst birth control mistakes " when a woman tells her ob - gyn that she wants to go on birth control , most doctors offer the @entity13 right off the bat , " @entity46 says			1
" that needs to change			0
if there were a drug for cancer that was 20 times more effective , we would obviously recommend that first -- and that 's what we should be doing for contraception , as well			1
" a third type of birth control , the hormone injections sold under the brand name @entity128 , had a low failure rate comparable to those of iuds and implants , the study found			1
that rate may not accurately reflect the real - world effectiveness of the shots , however , since the study included only women who received them every three months , as required , @entity46 says			2
@entity141 , @entity47 , a professor of ob - gyn at the @entity143 , in @entity144 , says doctors in her field have been anxiously awaiting the publication of these findings , which emerged from a broader ongoing study , known as the @entity150 , that was developed to promote @entity104 use in and around @entity23			0
" it definitely confirms what most people in family planning have expected , that the @entity104 methods are by far the most effective , " says @entity141 , who was not involved in the study			0
" we 've been anticipating this choice data for a while , because it 's such a great way to look at outcomes of different contraceptive methods in real life			0
" @entity0 : what 's healthier : the pill or an iud ? the choice project , however , differs from real life in key ways that may shed light on why iuds are n't more widely used			2
the project , which is funded in part by the @entity174 , was purposefully designed to remove all financial barriers to the use of iuds and implants , which have a high upfront cost -- $ 500 or more -- and are n't always covered by insurance			0
all of the study participants , who ranged in age from 14 to 45 , received a prescription for their preferred birth control method for two to three years , free of charge			1
with cost taken out of the equation , more than three - quarters of the participants opted for an iud or implant -- a proportion roughly 10 times higher than in the general population			0
in addition , the participants talked with a doctor about the risks and benefits of each birth control method before making a selection			2
this counseling session also may have helped to encourage @entity5 and implant use by dispelling many of the misconceptions that surround long - term birth control , @entity46 says			1
@entity0 : common birth control side effects @entity5 , for instance , have n't fully shaken the bad reputation they earned in the 1970s , when an early device known as the @entity211 was pulled from the market after it was found to cause infection and injury			2
decades later , some gynecologists still are n't trained to insert @entity5 , and others believe that many women -- such as those who have never had children -- are not good candidates for the method , @entity46 says			0
in fact , today 's iuds and implants have been shown to be safe and effective for a wide range of women , including teenagers , @entity141 says			2
women who are interested in trying one should talk to a gynecologist , or more than one , she adds			0
" if you 're told that you 're not a good candidate , you should n't necessarily take that at face value , " she says			0
" you might need to take an advocacy role for yourself if you really want the best options available to you			0
