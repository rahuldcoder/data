-- efforts to reform the @entity3 have been stymied by " corruption and lack of political will , " and police are wrongly being used to help fight the insurgency instead of crime , an independent research group said in a report			1
an @entity12 policeman guards the scene of a suicide attack in @entity15 on november 27			0
" the @entity20 military ... still mainly sees the police as an auxiliary security force rather than an enforcer of the law , " the @entity16 concluded in a report posted thursday on its web site			0
" too much emphasis is still placed on using the police to fight the insurgency rather than crime			2
" the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) is ill - equipped for this role , and has been targeted by the @entity31 , with 1,200 killed in 2007 and a similar toll expected in 2008 , " the group added			1
the @entity31 will be on the agenda during the first visit by @entity35 's president to @entity12 on friday			1
the talks come amid ongoing warfare and tension along the @entity12 - @entity35 border			1
some of the @entity31 militants conducting attacks in @entity12 have been based in @entity35 's @entity42 and nearby tribal regions			1
" the goal of the @entity12 government and the international community should be a national police force able to uphold the rule of law , and thereby help tackle the root causes of alienation that drive the insurgency , " the @entity16 said			2
the group described @entity12 's @entity53 as a " hub of systemic corruption , " and accuses the department of placing " personal enrichment " above the need for improved policing			1
recent leadership changes at the @entity53 should be used to stress that abuses will no longer be tolerated			0
" there has been little political will in @entity15 or foreign capitals to tackle the power brokers who are preventing reform , " said @entity62 , the group 's @entity63 project director			0
" organized crime and lawlessness lie at the heart of much popular disillusionment and instability			0
better law enforcement , including a functioning judicial system , would help counter any appeal the insurgents may hold in @entity12 , " he added			2
the @entity16 covers more than 60 countries and territories , using field - based analysis and advocacy to deter and resolve deadly conflicts .			0
