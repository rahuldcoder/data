@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was more than 40 years ago , but @entity4 still remembers the first time he went diving in the @entity6			1
" it was just the most magical place i 'd ever been to , " said @entity4 , 56			2
" the coral reefs were so pretty			1
so many fish and so many neat things to see			0
" @entity4 became a commercial fisherman and tropical fish collector , working in the ocean nearly every day of the year			2
but by the mid- 1980s , he noticed a troubling trend			0
two of the region 's most important corals , staghorn and elkhorn , were in drastic decline			0
the corals -- tiny , stationary marine animals that make up the reefs -- were dying because of many reasons , including climate change , pollution and overfishing , experts said			1
today , they 're on the endangered species list			0
" the coral reefs of the @entity6 are the most threatened and the heaviest - used coral reefs in the world , " said @entity30 , southeast regional director of the @entity31 , an entity of the @entity32			1
reefs are often referred to as the rainforests of the sea			2
they attract more marine life than anywhere else in the ocean because of the natural shelter they provide			1
but they 're declining worldwide , not just in @entity1 , and some scientists fear that they could all be gone by 2050			0
" coral reefs provide protection for our coastal areas , habitat for fish and recreational opportunities for millions and millions of people , " @entity4 said			1
" it 's very important to protect that whole ecosystem			0
" reefs also have great economic value			2
many people around the world depend on fisheries and the ocean for their livelihood			0
in the @entity6 alone , more than 50 percent of the local economy is connected to a healthy marine environment			1
" if coral reefs died completely , entire economies would be disrupted , " @entity4 said			1
as @entity4 saw reefs die over the years , he became very concerned			1
" it became a consuming passion ( for me ) to try to find ways to protect and restore coral reefs , " he said			1
that passion led to @entity4 starting the @entity73 , which has grown more than 25,000 staghorn and elkhorn corals in underwater nurseries			1
he and his staff of volunteers work three days a week maintaining the nurseries just off @entity0			0
the nurseries cover more than an acre of the ocean floor			0
" @entity4 's coral nursery is the largest in the wider @entity84 , " @entity30 said			1
" it 's probably 10 times larger than any others that i know of			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity91 @entity4 's methods for growing corals have evolved over the years , but they 're all simple , easily duplicated and can be taught to anyone who can dive , he said			1
after the corals spend about a year growing in the nursery , they are transplanted to a reef in the wild			2
the goal is to get them to reproduce on their own and repopulate an area where they no longer exist			0
" we 've been able to recreate one of the biggest thickets in the @entity6 of staghorn coral , and that 's something we can duplicate throughout the @entity6 and throughout the @entity84 , " @entity4 said			1
through education and awareness , @entity4 has built a community committed to bringing coral reefs back to the @entity6			1
his organization often collaborates with other groups , including the @entity32 and the @entity117 , a nonprofit conservation group			0
@entity4 also spends a lot of time showing high school students his methods and working with them at his nurseries			1
" this is n't just about me , " @entity4 emphasized			2
" it 's about engaging a lot of people and training people , and i think it has a lot of hope			0
" the impact is already noticeable in areas where corals have been transplanted			0
fish and other marine life are starting to come back , and @entity4 is hopeful that in time , the @entity6 ' ecosystem will recover			1
" most people think coral takes forever to grow , but some of these corals grow really fast , " he said			0
" they grow fast enough that we could make a big difference in a lifetime or less			0
" @entity4 's most ambitious project is just ahead			2
within the next five years , the @entity73 plans to grow and transplant 50,000 corals in the @entity6 , which he says is the largest effort of its kind in @entity1 and the @entity84			2
" before , i felt helpless watching corals die , " @entity4 said			2
" now i think there 's a way for everybody to get involved			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity73 website at @entity157 and see how to help .			0

@entity4 is helping to restore dying coral reefs in the @entity6
he and his group are growing coral in nurseries before transplanting them to the wild
@entity4 : coral reefs are *critical* to marine life , many economies
