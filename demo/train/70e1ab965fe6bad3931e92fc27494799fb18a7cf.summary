-- ah , fandom , it 's a curious and wonderful thing			2
when it was announced last year that we would be getting a @entity5 version of " @entity6 , " fans of the band ( myself included ) were pretty excited			1
the band that helped turn the ' 90s punk - rock revival into a more mainstream , pop - radio movement would be getting some major attention in the digital world			2
when the game was released on tuesday , i could n't wait to get home and see if i could play like @entity19 or sing like @entity20			2
but with so many other versions of " @entity6 " out there , why would you want to spend money on this game ? well , for starters , any fanboy or fangirl will love the loading screens with @entity5 specific graphics and sounds			1
you also get to view cool memorabilia , like still photos and rare video footage of the band , for completing songs in career mode			1
playing songs like " @entity38 " and " @entity46 " brings back memories of college days , and yes , i will admit i wish they had put " @entity45 " in the game , because it 's the only hidden track that @entity5 has ever included on an album			1
maybe an easter egg is hiding in the shadows for us to discover ? there are also unique drum lessons written specifically for this version of the game			1
from what i 've seen , even veteran @entity6 players will need them			0
most of the songs included in the game are ones that fans of @entity5 can listen to again and again			1
now we can also tell our friends , " yeah , i five - starred ' @entity62 ! ' " hardcore " @entity6 " fans have posted videos on @entity65 of themselves playing in expert mode and achieving five gold stars , which is something that not even the members of @entity5 were able to do , according to a recent interview with @entity71			1
the graphics are really well done in this game and the motion - capture technique used to animate the @entity5 doppelganger is pretty impressive			1
when the piano opening to " @entity77 ( @entity78 ) " starts playing , @entity20 encourages the audience to clap and fakes surprise when the piano stops before the song kicks into high gear			0
it 's almost like being at a concert -- i nearly forgot i was supposed to start singing			0
also notable is that the band 's clothing choices match the theme and era of each album			0
" @entity77 " has an almost steampunk feel to it			0
in the @entity95 venue the band is decked out in waistcoats , trousers and pin - striped shirts to match the vibe of the album			0
as with most of the " @entity6 " games , when you earn four stars or more on a song , you get a reward			0
in this case , you get " cred " instead of " fans " and with that the ability to open up more sets with tougher songs like " peacemaker " from " @entity77 " -- a fun , fast - paced song about death and destruction			2
all the members of @entity5 play an instrument and sing at the same time , which is no small feat given the technical difficulty of the bass lines and @entity19 's blazing fast drumming speed			1
my other " band mate " was busy clacking away on his guitar and would n't have been able to sing if he tried , nor would i when behind my electronic drum kit			0
sore arms and scratchy voice aside , " @entity5 : @entity6 " is a lot of fun			2
fans both new and old will enjoy playing along with their favorite songs			0
we may not all be able to unlock achievements like " it 's all fun until someone @entity136 " or " @entity138 or @entity139 , " but we 'll have fun trying .			0

the video game 's career mode offers rare video footage of the band playing
want to drum like @entity19 ? you might need the " @entity5 : @entity6 " - specific drum lessons
*details* make this game exciting for fans -- even wardrobe is *varied* and *historically* correct
