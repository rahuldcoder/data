-- @entity2 , so the saying goes , is the mother of all invention			0
but as history often shows adversity is often the catalyst for creativity , inspiring inventors to life - saving feats of ingenuity			1
gripping story @entity13 @entity12 is credited with creating the world 's first vulcanized rubber sole after six climbing companions perished in a snowstorm on the @entity18 in 1935			1
@entity19 concluded that the climber 's hobnail boots were in part to blame and set about trying to improve grip and flexion of the sole			2
in 1936 he designed his first rubber sole and the following year , with help from tire manufacturer @entity28 , launched the first @entity12 sole			2
an historic peak in the @entity12 story was reached in july 1954 when an @entity13 expedition led by @entity33 ( equipped with boot soles made by @entity12 ) became the first reach the summit of the world 's second highest mountain @entity37 in @entity40			1
today , the company manufacture 40 million pairs of rubber soles annually , supplying shoe manufacturers around the world including @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
wind - up merchant @entity52 inventor @entity51 was inspired to create his wind - up radio after seeing a 1991 tv program about the spread of hiv / aids across the @entity58 continent			1
in a bid to help the transmission of health safety messages , @entity51 set about building a radio that worked without electricity or batteries -- both of which are in short supply across @entity58			2
using a hand crank , a spring and a small dynamo , @entity51 was able to produce enough energy to power a radio			2
the later addition of a clockwork mechanism also enabled the amount of power to be controlled			0
millions of @entity58 have benefited from his invention , but @entity51 has n't profited financially from his brilliant brainwave			2
earlier this year , the 76 - year - old told a @entity52 newspaper that he was broke and could be forced to sell his @entity81 home			1
space spinoff @entity84 engineer @entity83 's was inspired to invent a compact cabin pressure monitor following the tragic death of golfer @entity87 in october 1999			1
the double @entity89 champion was traveling on a @entity90 from @entity91 , @entity92 to @entity93 , @entity94 when the cabin pressure gradually started to fall			1
hypoxia ( oxygen deprivation ) incapacitated and then killed both pilots , @entity87 and three other passengers before the plane , which was on autopilot , ran out of fuel and crashed			1
the @entity102 and @entity103 is a hand - held device that uses sounds , vibrations and visual warnings to alert users to possible hypoxia - causing conditions before it 's too late , @entity84 says			1
the invention earned @entity84 's @entity113 in 2003			1
inflating survival chances @entity115 was inspired to invent an airbag after crashing his car while out on a sunday drive with his wife and seven - year - old daughter in 1952			1
the @entity123 industrial engineer ended up in a ditch after swerving to evade a rock in the road -- his daughter only avoided hitting the dashboard thanks to the outstretched arms of @entity115 and his wife			0
the experience prompted @entity115 to create and patent a " safety cushion " device which inflated when a car comes to an abrupt halt			0
although the idea failed to attract the interest of the automobile industry at the time , his work paved the way for future models			0
airbags came into widespread use in cars towards the end of the 1980s and have helped save thousands of lives around the world			0
the first production motorcycles to be equipped with airbags started appearing in 2006			0
a smokin ' idea african - american inventor @entity152 gave the world not one , but two lifesaving devices			1
watching firefighters battling smoke in burning buildings inspired @entity152 to invent the " @entity160 " in 1912 which is considered a forerunner to the gas mask			2
the patented invention consisted of a hood and two tubes -- one long tube to breathe in cleaner air at ground level and another to exhale			0
in 1916 , @entity152 used the device to help rescue two men from a smoke - filled tunnel after an explosion at the @entity173			0
his bravery earned the inventor a gold medal from the @entity177			0
seven years later , @entity152 was helping save more lives , this time on the roads			0
after witnessing a traffic accident at an intersection he invented a new electric traffic signal			0
rather than just having " stop " and " go " signs , @entity152 's traffic light included a third position -- similar in principle to today 's amber signal -- warning drivers to be cautious			0
@entity189 bought @entity152 's patent for $ 40,000 .			0

inventors often inspired to break new ground in the wake of trauma and tragedy
