-- @entity1 is having quite the year : she won a @entity2 for her performance in the mini-series @entity5 , she 's co-starring in the final season of @entity7 beginning this spring , and now , she 's on the cover of this week 's @entity9			1
@entity1 comes off as a @entity10 in the @entity9 profile , talking about how normal she is — she watches a lot of tv ! she has two cats ! she loves @entity16 games ! — and also touching on some less - normal topics , like her ties with @entity19 and her relationship with @entity21			1
we rounded up the highlights below : she 's a jokester on set — until it 's showtime while filming @entity28 , a romantic comedy ( with a twist ) that premiered at @entity30 this year , @entity1 's microphone had to be moved because it was picking up the sound of her heartbeat			1
" she 's joking around casually and then you yell ' action ' and her heartbeat goes to 150 beats per minute , " says co-star @entity33			2
@entity37 's a fan @entity1 introduced herself to dame mirren when they sat at the same table at this year 's @entity2 , to which @entity38 replied : " i know who the f — you are			1
" safe to say @entity1 has made it			1
the cast of @entity7 play @entity16 games in their off - time @entity1 and her costars get along a lot better than their characters do on the show , apparently — so much so that @entity1 and co. tend to stick around after filming to hang out in what they call the set 's " base camp , " an area by the hair and makeup trailers that acts as a sort of living room for the cast			1
there , they play @entity65 , a game in which @entity1 excels			1
she 's lazy " i do n't go to classes			2
i do n't go to flea markets			2
i would like to do that stuff but i just do n't do that stuff			2
i was like , ' i guess we 'll go to the beach , because that 's something i would do if i had time and was n't so lazy ? ' " @entity1 says as she and @entity9 's reporter drive to the beach			1
but she does like watching shows like @entity79 and @entity80 in her free time — a woman after our own heart ! she does n't want to talk to you about @entity19 her affiliation with the church is well - known , but she 's done addressing it — even to her friends			1
" i said what it meant to me , and anyone can go and look at that if they want to know what i feel			0
but now it 's private , off limits			0
" @entity21 was ... not the best husband " it was extremely traumatic and awful and horrible , " @entity1 says of her marriage to the comedian , which lasted eight months			1
( the couple separated in 2010			0
) " at the same time , it turned out for the best			2
i 'm glad that i 'm not there			0
i 'm glad that it did n't happen when i was 50			0
i 'm glad i did n't have kids			0
and i got that out of the way			0
like , that 's probably not going to happen again			0
