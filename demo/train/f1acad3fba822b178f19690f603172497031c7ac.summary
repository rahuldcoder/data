-- president @entity1 headed to the @entity2 on wednesday night to meet with @entity4 president @entity3 and sign an arms control agreement that reduces the nuclear stockpiles of both nations			1
the new @entity8 ( @entity8 ) to be signed thursday by the two leaders builds on a previous agreement that expired in december			2
@entity1 has called the treaty the " the most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly two decades " and said it would cut the nuclear weapons of the @entity13 and @entity4 by about a third			1
after meeting with @entity3 and attending the signing ceremony in @entity17 , the @entity2 capital , @entity1 will have dinner with heads of government from 11 countries -- @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity2 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
the highlight of the two - day trip is the new treaty with @entity4 , which is another step in nuclear arms relations between the former @entity38 adversaries			1
its signing comes two days after the @entity1 administration announced a new @entity13 nuclear weapons policy and four days before @entity1 convenes a summit of 47 nations on nuclear security issues			1
" it significantly reduces missiles and launchers , " @entity1 said of the new treaty , which lasts for 10 years			1
" it puts in place a strong and effective verification regime			0
and it maintains the flexibility that we need to protect and advance our national security , and to guarantee our unwavering commitment to the security of our allies			0
" @entity1 has made nuclear non-proliferation a major priority of his presidency , prompting criticism from conservatives who fear the president will weaken the @entity13 nuclear deterrent against possible attack			1
" we believe that preventing nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation should begin by directly confronting the two leading proliferators and supporters of terrorism , @entity73 and @entity74 , " according to a statement issued tuesday by @entity78 's two @entity77 @entity13 senators , @entity79 and @entity80			0
" the @entity82 's policies , thus far , have failed to do that and this failure has sent exactly the wrong message to other would be proliferators and supporters of terrorism			0
" according to information released by the @entity88 , the new treaty limits both nations to " significantly fewer strategic arms within seven years " of its signing			1
one of the limits : 1,550 warheads			2
" warheads on deployed @entity95 ( intercontinental ballistic missiles ) and deployed @entity97 ( submarine - launched ballistic missiles ) count toward this limit and each deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments counts as one warhead toward this limit , " the @entity88 said			0
there also are limits on launchers			2
the treaty also lays out a " verification regime " that includes on - site inspections , data exchanges and notifications , the @entity88 said			0
" the treaty does not contain any constraints on testing , development or deployment of current or planned @entity13 missile defense programs or current or planned @entity13 long - range conventional strike capabilities , " according to the @entity88			0
@entity1 said the agreement is part of the @entity13 effort to " reset " the @entity13 relationship with @entity4			1
" with this agreement , the @entity13 and @entity4 -- the two largest nuclear powers in the world -- also send a clear signal that we intend to lead , " the president said			1
" by upholding our own commitments under the @entity130 , we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons , and to ensure that other nations meet their own responsibilities			2
" negotiators have been working since april 2009 to wrap up the " follow - on " to the 1991 @entity8 agreement			2
talks were difficult , with disagreements over verification , including on - site inspection of missiles that carry nuclear warheads			0
a @entity13 official with knowledge of the talks earlier said that negotiators had found " innovative " ways to verify what each side has			0
verification will be a top issue politically because the @entity154 and the @entity4 parliament will each have to ratify any agreement			0
@entity4 officials at one point objected to the @entity1 administration 's plans to build a missile - defense system in @entity162			2
specifically , they were angered by news leaks from @entity29 that it had agreed to allow missile interceptors to be installed in that country			0
the issue , according to arms control experts , was resolved by including non-binding language in the @entity8 treaty 's preamble stating that there is a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons ; however , the treaty itself deals only with limits on offensive weapons systems			1
this resolution could help placate @entity13 critics who want no link in the treaty between offensive and defensive weapons , arguing that it might be used to try to limit a @entity13 missile - defense plan			0
the new treaty would be the first pact related to arms control since the end of the @entity38 , experts have said , setting the stage for further arms reductions that will tackle thorny issues such as what to do with non-deployed warheads that are kept in storage , tactical nuclear weapons and further cuts in missiles and launch vehicles			1
some of those issues are expected to come up at the nuclear security summit in @entity200 on april 12 - 13 .			0
