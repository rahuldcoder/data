-- in a warehouse about the size of four football fields , more than a million units of online retail items are housed			1
it is essential that all inventory is organized and easy to find , in order to get these items to their final destinations on time -- that is , unless the inventory needed can be summoned on demand			2
that is exactly what happens at the 25,500 - square - meter quiet logistics fulfillment center , in @entity17 , where 200 robots help workers prepare 10,000 to 20,000 orders for delivery every day			1
it uses a system designed by @entity25 subsidiary @entity24 that keeps track of all inventory so the robots know exactly what is on each storage unit			1
" the robots job is really to move inventory from storage to the work station , " said @entity32 vp of third - party fulfillment at @entity35			1
" anytime someone places an order ... the robot is dispatched to the storage location that has that unit and brings it to our associates to pick			0
" @entity24 robots have a reported accuracy rate of 99.99 % , so human error is practically eliminated in this phase of the process			1
with names like @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56 , each robot is given its own identity and its own assignments			2
like a choreographed routine they move autonomously up and down the aisles of the warehouse at about 10 kilometers per hour -- never missing a step , and always hitting their mark			2
this is made possible by the bar codes they drive over and the cameras on the bottom of the drive units , which together communicate where the bot is driving to			0
they are designed to operate in tight quarters and at just 76 cm long , 64cm wide and 41 cm high , the robots are small enough to travel under the storage units , yet strong enough to lift almost a metric ton of merchandise			0
they can even find the charging station when their power is running low			1
what keeps this mechanical workforce performing with such precision -- and from crashing into each other -- is the software that commands it			0
" we think of the software as being a giant air traffic control system , " says @entity87 , senior vp of sales and marketing at @entity35			0
" the software will allocate a certain number of spots to a specific robot ; that 's what keeps the robots from hitting each other " he adds : " in terms of overall productivity , the use of the robotics tend to be around anywhere between three - and - a - half to upwards of five times more productive , so we 'd have to have that many more people to actually get the same amount of work done			1
" but the human touch is still necessary to get the products out the door			0
@entity35 has 400 people working on fulfillment at the @entity17 facility alone , so these smart machines are not yet ready to replace living workers			0
but they do make it easier to get the job done .			0
