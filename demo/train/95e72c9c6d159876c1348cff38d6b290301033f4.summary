" the @entity2 is visiting @entity0 this week for a conference and to meet with @entity114 @entity113 , who has just been named as president @entity116 's special coordinator on @entity117 , @entity111 spokesman @entity110 said monday			1
the @entity2 wo n't meet with @entity116 , who instead plans to visit with him after a presidential trip next month to @entity119 , @entity110 said			1
the @entity2 and @entity117 are dicey issues in @entity0 , since @entity121 considers the @entity124 province a part of @entity119 and accuses the spiritual leader of advocating @entity127 independence			1
the @entity2 -- whose name is @entity58 -- has repeatedly said he seeks autonomy for the region , not independence , and advocates the " middle way " of nonviolence			1
@entity119 has ruled @entity117 since 1951 , a year after sending troops to " liberate " the region from what it said was serfdom under the @entity2			2
the @entity2 's emissaries have held sporadic talks with @entity119 officials			1
but the talks , encouraged by the @entity5 and other countries , have failed to break the impasse			2
in a 2007 trip to @entity0 , the @entity2 met with then - president @entity144 , who awarded him the @entity145 , the nation 's highest civilian honor			1
asked whether the lack of a meeting between the @entity2 and @entity116 represents a change in @entity5 policy toward @entity119 or @entity117 , @entity110 said , " i would n't necessarily read ... anything into the decision beyond what it is			1
" " our position regarding @entity119 is clear , that we want to engage @entity119			0
we think @entity119 is an important global player			0
we also do n't try and downplay some of the concerns that we have about @entity119 ... in the areas of human rights , religious freedom , and freedom of expression			2
" the @entity2 won a @entity163 for advocating peace , but he has not been allowed to return to @entity117 since fleeing his homeland in 1959			2
on thursday and friday , he is scheduled to participate in a conference called " @entity167 for the @entity168			2
" on saturday he is to spend the morning teaching on " @entity170 : finding wisdom in the @entity175 , " an event organized by the @entity172 and @entity173			0
