-- this week 's devastating crash of a high - speed train in @entity3 , which left nearly 80 dead , has drawn renewed attention to rail safety at a time when the @entity8 administration has prioritized the construction of fast new rail links			1
these trains whisk passengers between city centers at speeds of 200 mph or more			0
@entity16 and @entity17 riders have enjoyed such service for decades			0
but such fast trains are still largely unknown to @entity20 thanks to decades of minimal government support for track improvement			1
as a result , intercity trains in the @entity20 are mostly limited to about 110 mph			2
so far , the @entity8 administration , thanks to support from congressional democrats , has distributed more than $ 10 billion to begin investing in faster train service			1
construction on the first phase of a link between @entity34 and @entity35 , which will be the country 's fastest rail line , will begin over the next few months			2
as recently as this spring , then - transportation secretary @entity37 suggested the government planned to connect 80 % of @entity20 to such trains by around 2040			1
the trains will be fast			0
will they also be safe ? indeed , there have been a number of high - profile rail crashes over the years			1
in 1998,101 riders were killed in @entity46 when a train crashed in @entity48			0
and in 2011 , two of @entity51 's newest , fastest trains slammed into one another , killing 40 people			0
but those are exceptions to the rule , caused by poor maintenance and monitoring			0
rail , high speed or not , is one of the safest ways to get around			1
according to a @entity63 review of 10 years of transportation fatalities , for every mile traveled , car drivers and passengers are more than 10 times as likely to die in accidents as passenger rail riders			2
in 21 years -- between 1990 and 2011 -- the @entity71 shows that nearly 900,000 people died in highway crashes , while fewer than 15,000 died in train collisions			0
other countries ' experience shows that high - speed rail can be even safer than the much slower @entity20 trains			1
the bullet trains that zoom through @entity80 and @entity81 , for instance , testify to the astonishing safety offered by well - managed rail services			1
each nation 's system has been in operation for more than 30 years and provided billions of rides			0
yet thanks to advanced safety systems and extensive maintenance , no passengers -- zero -- have died as a result of a high - speed train crash in either country			1
improvements in the design of @entity46 trains and a review of maintenance operations in @entity51 have also prevented repeats of previous train accidents in those countries			0
early reports suggest that the train crash in @entity3 could have been avoided			1
the train may have been traveling at more than twice the allowed speed limit			2
modern train control equipment is designed to brake trains automatically when they travel too quickly or come too close to another train			0
unfortunately , that train in @entity3 did not use that system			1
the good news is that the @entity20 , whose rail system already has a strong safety record , is becoming safer thanks to investments being made by public and private entities			1
the @entity120 mandated last year that by 2015 all intercity track be equipped with train control systems that would prevent crashes such as this week 's accident in @entity3			2
these realities should relieve the concerns of those uncomfortable about investing billions of dollars in @entity20 intercity train networks			2
the international record shows that high - speed rail is very safe to use			1
an equally urgent question is whether such trains would provide a significant upgrade to the nation 's transportation network , and here again the evidence is clear that they would			0
high - speed rail offers the option to travel at fast speeds across hundreds of miles between downtowns in many of the country 's largest metropolitan regions			1
hopping on a train to travel between @entity144 and @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 , @entity148 , or @entity149 and @entity150 in two hours or less would aid economic development by easing business trips			0
it would also lessen the stress of travel for millions of @entity20			2
no more sitting in traffic , grinding teeth at the wheel			0
no more long airport security lines and shoe removals			0
the environmental benefits would also be significant			0
@entity163 's system , the only one already set for construction in the @entity20 , will operate on renewable energy alone			1
train service similar to that already offered in @entity16 and @entity17 countries would require a significant investment , but for many routes , an improved rail system is a worthy endeavor			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity175 : high - speed train crash in @entity3 draws new attention to rail safety
he says @entity8 wants high - speed rail , and construction will start soon in @entity163
he says @entity80 , @entity81 have had safe , well - managed high - speed rail for decades
@entity175 : high - speed rail could *revolutionize* transportation in @entity20 and is worth doing
