-- there was a time , as she emerged from the rubble of the 2008 campaign , when @entity5 was the hottest cultural figure in @entity7			1
she had transcended the narrow bounds of politics to become a larger - than - life figure , the woman portrayed by @entity16 , the mama grizzly from @entity17			0
every journalist in the country knew that if you put @entity5 's name in an online headline or television segment , your clicks and ratings would soar			1
little wonder that @entity27 chairman @entity26 rushed to sign her as a million - dollar - a - year contributor and built a modern studio for @entity5 in her @entity32 home			1
by the time word trickled out friday that @entity5 's contract would not be renewed , the reaction was a collective shrug			1
and therein lies a lesson -- about the fleeting nature of fame but also about the nature of media commentary			2
news : @entity5 speaks out after leaving @entity27 the exiled - politician - turned - pundit has been a growing staple of cable news			1
@entity0 began the tradition by returning @entity48 to " @entity49 " in between his presidential runs			0
@entity51 is packed with such @entity53 figures as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
and for a time as the 2012 campaign approached , the @entity27 payroll included no fewer than four potential presidential candidates : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity5			1
the former vice-presidential nominee was both newsmaker and news commentator , staging a @entity66 bus tour in the summer of 2011 to flirt with the idea of making a @entity69 bid , though it was all for show			2
but @entity5 never quite had the impact of , say , a @entity72 as a @entity27 talking head			1
she became something of a one - note wonder , jabbing at president @entity76 for failing to deliver on the hope - y change - y thing but reluctant to challenge her fellow @entity78 , especially after @entity80 rolled to the nomination			0
it was n't clear what @entity5 stood for			2
she also reflexively jabbed the media ( except for @entity27 ) , seemingly more interested in settling scores than driving an agenda			1
as @entity5 appeared from @entity17 with less frequency , she became less a part of the national conversation			2
the future seemed limitless in 2009 , when @entity5 wrote a book that was a monster best - seller and starred in a @entity94 reality series about @entity17			2
her daughter @entity96 would become a " @entity100 " celebrity ( though this would prove to be a mixed blessing )			0
and the former half - term governor was a force in the 2010 midterm elections , even while holding forth on @entity27			2
a low point came after the @entity106 shooting , when some commentators unfairly tried to link @entity5 to the tragedy by noting that her political committee had ( unwisely ) put out a map with the contests involving the @entity113 congresswoman and other @entity53 marked with crosshairs			0
against the advice of @entity26 , @entity5 lashed out in a @entity117 video , accusing critics of a " blood libel " and sparking a debate over whether she was likening herself to centuries of @entity122 against @entity123			0
by 2012 , tea party fervor had faded , and the @entity78 had moved on from the @entity5 era			0
the movie " @entity128 " depicted @entity5 as a temperamental and ignorant candidate who was n't much interested in learning			0
and @entity27 itself , after parting company with @entity132 , edged away from the hard right			0
during the @entity135 , @entity5 complained one night that @entity27 had canceled her appearances			1
when her three - year deal was up , @entity26 offered @entity5 a new contract -- but at a fraction of her seven - figure salary			0
it was a lowball offer , and both sides agreed to an amicable separation			0
in an interview with @entity145 , @entity5 talks about broadening her audience , saying : " i know the country needs more truth - telling in the media , and i 'm willing to do that			1
" @entity5 still has a passionate following and can still make news with a single @entity117 posting			1
but for @entity27 , at least , her market value had clearly plunged , and a divorce was inevitable			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			1

@entity158 : four years *ago* , @entity5 's name *electrified* the media
@entity27 has dropped @entity5 as a commentator ; she no *longer* generates buzz , he says
@entity5 failed to occupy a major role in news commentary at @entity27 , @entity158 says
@entity158 : @entity5 has talked about broadening audience for her views
