-- some hobbies take talent , others do n't , but the real skill is turning your weird past - time into an international event			1
whether one 's passion is to sculpt masterpieces out of sand or charge at @entity12 with an umbrella , somewhere , there 's a festival dedicated to honing those skills			1
few hobbies invite ridicule like air guitar			1
yet the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , regularly attracts over 10,000 " airheads " ( this year 's event , which took place last week , was no exception )			2
though the judges seem to take the sport seriously , judging contestants on their technical skills , stage presence and " airiness , " the festival started as a bit of a lark			1
" we started out in 1996 to promote the @entity36			2
it was a half joke , " says @entity37 , the event 's co-founder			2
since those early days , however , the championship has matured			2
contrary to popular opinion , says @entity37 , air guitar takes talent			1
" when it comes to competitive playing , the standard is quite high			2
it 's a contest of showmanship			2
it 's very well timed and choreographed and there 's drama to each performance			2
think of it as a combination of stand - up comedy and rock opera , " she says			2
true aficionados can even earn a little extra cash			1
last year 's winner , @entity59 , scored a contract with soft drink brand @entity61 and , like many of his contemporaries , routinely works the festival circuit			1
the strange hobby capital of the world , however , is @entity68 , @entity69			0
the tiny town hosts the man versus @entity74 , the @entity75 and the ever - popular @entity76 , the latter of which was held on august 25			0

the event requires snorkeled and finned - participants to swim two laps in a 180 - foot peat bog			1
" it 's muddy , so it 's dark and you ca n't see , and a lot of people are n't used to breathing through a snorkel			0
generally , it 's pretty cold , and you also have to deal with the leeches and water scorpions , " says @entity79			1
contestants do n't do it for the money ( all proceeds go to charity ) , as much as the glory			0
according to @entity79 , some train quite hard for the event , and go as far as to snorkel blindfolded for practice			0
even those competitions that are today taken in earnest have some pretty arbitrary origins			0
in 1933 , @entity115 - based photographer @entity114 came across a group of boys racing in homemade vehicles , and decided to stage an impromptu race			1
the event has since morphed into one of most popular events on the @entity128 calendar , the @entity123 , in which kids and teenagers race homemade cars			1
despite its name , the event attracts an international crowd , and many of the pre-adult contestants have grown up to become famous racers and engineers			0
" @entity123 racing teaches you not only the racing , but how to build a car , and what goes into making it fast , " says @entity137 , the marketing director for the event			1
contestants range in age from 7 to 17 , and all have to qualify either by winning their local race , or racking up enough points in a rally race			0
as scholarships make up the winning booty , there 's a lot at stake for potential winners			0
as a result , @entity137 notes , many practice pretty hard			0

in @entity166 , @entity167 , children and adults alike take part in a more whimsical dash : the @entity170			1
the race is composed of human - powered works of art designed to travel over land , mud and water ( @entity178 's car would qualify )			0
sculptures resemble anything and everything , from flying pigs to fluffy pink dogs			0
prizes are awarded for conking out first , for maintaining middle ground , and for keeping all feet off the floor			0
" we give out almost as many awards as there are vehicles , " explains @entity188 , founder of the @entity189 , which hosts the event			0
the race incorporates 15 miles of downtown @entity166 and the harbor and , if not @entity166 's biggest sporting event , it is certainly its wackiest			1
volunteers dressed as chickens help guide vehicles along the right path , while bearded doctors in nursing uniforms are on standby should any injuries occur			0
" so much of art is self - involved , " explains @entity188			0
" this is a masterpiece of how to bring joy to an entire city			1
