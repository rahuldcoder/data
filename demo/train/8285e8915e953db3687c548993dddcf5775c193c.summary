@entity0 -- the release of a massive report on torture tuesday by the @entity5 has been accompanied by a strong statement by president @entity7 , who notes that it describes in detail " a troubling program involving enhanced interrogation techniques in secret facilities outside the @entity13 " by operatives working for the @entity15			1
this report -- we 're talking about nearly 500 pages summarizing more than 6,000 pages of data and analysis -- will certainly refocus the world 's attention on this sordid phase in recent @entity13 history			1
@entity7 acknowledged that his predecessors in the @entity27 faced " agonizing choices " after 9/11 , and they acted in ways meant to protect against future attacks by @entity31			0
still , this new accounting of that period has raised protests from politicians on both sides of the aisle , but especially @entity38 , who do n't want to drag up painful memories of the @entity41 administration -- not in this , their finest hour			0
but it has also raised many questions demanding answers			2
i 'm in @entity0 as i write this , and there is already a great deal of talk about this report in the press			2
indeed , for many , troubling questions arise : how could @entity13 have allowed their government to fly prisoners suspected of terrorist connections to " black sites " in @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 , where , as the report describes , they were hideously tortured in the hopes of extracting information from them about future plots against the homeland ? ( and people did know that something like this could be going on , as reporters often described the existence of shadowy rendition programs without knowing the specific details			1
) is this how tax dollars were best spent to protect @entity13 against future threats ? other questions swirl , but one seems especially relevant as we continue our necessary efforts to combat terrorism : is torture an effective technique for getting reliable information ? the report reviews 20 prominent cases that had been brought forth -- by intelligence officials and even alluded to by former president @entity41 -- as examples of torture that worked , it concludes that none of this brutality resulted in useful information			1
this corresponds to what experts have suggested all along : torture simply does n't work and may actually be counterproductive in the fight against terrorism			2
the problem is n't with those who actually possess relevant information , it 's with those who do n't			2
men being tortured will saying anything to stop the interrogator from drowning him or abusing him -- and some of the methods detailed in this report are truly horrific			2
top intelligence and military officials clearly warned the government as early as 2002 that this brutality does n't work			0
in fact , torture generates " unreliable information , " as this report affirms ; it produces information that requires fact - checking that soon produces more misinformation			1
as @entity119 observed in 2006 , in a useful book about the practice of torture during the @entity123 ( 1954 - 1962 ) : " history offers no modern examples of the strategic effectiveness of harsh interrogation techniques , but it is replete with examples of the negative strategic effects such techniques have on the counterinsurgency force			0
" there is the additional problem that @entity13 enemies can use the fact that we have tortured prisoners as an excuse to torture @entity13 captives			1
indeed , one ca n't help but wonder if the fury unleashed by @entity142 in @entity143 and @entity144 has its origins at least partially in the dark history of @entity13 torture			1
as the poet @entity152 so memorably wrote : " those to whom evil is done / do evil in return			0
" a truly democratic society depends on the rule of law and respect for human rights ; it is the most important baseline we have			1
when a nation gives in to illegality and brutality -- and torture is both -- it is degrading itself , opening doors and windows that will never be easily closed			0
@entity165 and @entity166 were famous for their methods			0
the @entity13 must set a better example			1
in one of his first acts as chief executive in 2009 , president @entity7 outlawed secret renditions and torture			0
this bold declaration was widely seen as a move that helped to restore the moral authority of the @entity13 , which had badly suffered under the presidency of @entity41			1
unfortunately , the @entity5 report is not the sort of thing most @entity13 will ever read , and already there has been a backlash by those who regard its publication as a partisan political move			1
no doubt they would rather spend their time and money on investigating what happened in 2012 in @entity192 , @entity193 , and how it came to be that @entity195 , the @entity13 ambassador to the @entity196 , was given some erroneous " talking points " before she went on sunday morning talk shows to discuss the attack , that killed four @entity13			2
i wish both @entity38 and @entity201 could see that information like the @entity5 report is the lifeblood of @entity13 democracy			1
this admission of torture will surely rile many in the @entity209 and elsewhere			0
but is n't it ultimately a good thing for other countries to see that we hold ourselves to high standards of self - examination ? we make mistakes , as all countries do			0
but we admit our mistakes			0
one last thing to consider : the new report confirms that president @entity41 was not directly briefed about the harshest techniques of torture before 2006 , although vice president @entity223 apparently attended meetings where these were discussed			2
so the question remains about whether we should actually try to punish those in the @entity13 government who authorized or committed these repulsive and unlawful acts of torture			1
i would tend to agree with @entity232 of the @entity233 , who wrote an article in the @entity235 suggesting that however much the idea of torture turns his stomach , it 's better for president @entity7 to pardon @entity41 and @entity223 for these ( my words ) crimes against humanity			0
they will , of course , never be prosecuted anyway			0
but by granting them pardons , @entity7 would -- symbolically -- show the world that we recognize that torture is illegal as well as reprehensible , and those who authorized it " were indeed criminals			0

@entity252 : @entity5 report on torture raises troubling questions and *controversy*
among them : how could @entity13 , morally , have allowed government to torture ?
he says torture is *ineffective* way to get reliable information ; puts @entity13 at risk
@entity252 : democracy needs rule of law , respect for human rights , @entity13 must reassert this
