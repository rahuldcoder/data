-- when a massive , muscle - bound american football player announced this weekend that he is gay , we watched yet another brick crumble in the monolith of @entity7 prejudice			1
to some , @entity9 's words might have come as a shock , but most @entity7 know the country is in the midst of a fundamental social shift , one that conjures images of a different place			1
where ? well , if you traveled from the @entity7 to the @entity19 a few years ago , what you saw -- and smelled -- in the streets of ultra-liberal @entity22 probably shocked you			1
young people smoking joints in an open - air @entity30 © , gay couples holding hands on the streets and people of all ages not batting an eye about any of it gave @entity7 visitors a novel and exotic experience			1
back then , the @entity7 and the @entity19 stood on opposite sides of the front line of the social wars			1
it 's not because the @entity19 has changed			1
it is the @entity7 , the @entity7 people , who have changed			1
the transformation in @entity7 public opinion , increasingly reflected in legislation , has narrowed what was an enormous gap between the two countries			1
change is coming at such a fast , accelerating rate that one wonders , is @entity7 turning into the @entity19 ? i will save you the trouble of answering			1
no , but there is no denying there is a visible convergence on key issues			0
as a frequent visitor to the @entity19 for many years , i can tell you that the disbelieving questions i used to face about @entity7 's puritanism have become much less frequent			1
( others , mostly about guns in @entity7 , have not abated			2
) in the summer of 1998 , then - @entity7 drug czar @entity64 triggered an unseemly diplomatic skirmish during a fact - finding visit to the @entity19 capital			1
the four - star general , charged with leading @entity7 's war on drugs , tensed up as he saw the smoke wafting out of perfectly legal pot - selling cafes in @entity22			1
he surveyed the permissive drug environment and publicly judged @entity19 drug policy an " unmitigated disaster			1
" @entity19 government officials responded with a barrage of statistics to prove the visitor wrong , and coffee shop customers declared @entity64 had no idea what he was talking about			2
the general may have been too focused on the drug situation to notice what was happening on the same - sex marriage front in the @entity19			1
perhaps he would have found that also disastrous			0
the parliament had just approved an innovative concept of " registered partnerships , " allowing couples , gay and straight , to be treated more or less the same as their legally married counterparts			0
in the @entity100 then , during the 1990s , the weapon of choice in the @entity99 arsenal was " family values			1
" the approval of same - sex marriage was about as likely in the @entity7 as , say , @entity105 president @entity104 officiating a gay wedding in @entity107 today			1
the 1992 and 1996 @entity99 conventions , which i attended as part of the @entity0 team , were choreographed carnivals of anti-gay invective			0
it was n't just @entity99			0
by substantial majorities , @entity7 opposed gay rights and , incidentally , strongly supported drug laws outlawing marijuana use			1
in a @entity0 poll in 1998 , a majority said they believed gay people can change their sexual orientation if they chose to do so			0
but at the same time , @entity7 views were beginning to budge			2
just as president @entity126 's public embrace of same - sex marriage gave a boost to popular support , @entity124 sensed an increase in acceptance and tried to propel change with an effort to end the ban on gays in the military			1
the reaction would have been laughable had it not been so outrageous			0
@entity139 , then the @entity140 chairman of the @entity141 , toured a submarine , expertly examining the bunks where sailors slept in close quarters			0
obviously , the tour indicated , gay men would find the temptation of nearby sailors simply irresistible			0
@entity124 changed course , approved the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and signed the @entity153 , both of which caused enormous injustices , both of which stayed in place until recently			0
in 2001 , @entity158 took office , invigorating republicans			0
that same year , the @entity19 became the world 's first country to legalize same - sex marriage			1
the day the bill became law , @entity22 's mayor became a registrar and personally officiated the country 's first such wedding			0
a @entity171 poll clocked support for same - sex marriage among @entity7 then at just 35 %			1
despite the head winds , the battle for equal rights has not stopped , not in the @entity7 , not in other corners of the world			2
as the @entity182 philosopher @entity181 explained more than 200 years ago , history itself is the progress of the consciousness of freedom			2
but it can not be stopped			0
today , @entity7 looks like a different country			2
in fact , in many respects it looks very much like the @entity19			2
today , a majority of @entity7 support same - sex marriage , which is legal in 17 states and the @entity195			1
and that majority is sure to continue growing , because the numbers are overwhelming among young people			0
even the legalization of marijuana , which is picking up legal support around the country , enjoys majority support			0
does that mean @entity7 is becoming more liberal ? not really			2
in the @entity19 , the driving philosophy is one of tolerance and compromise			2
in the @entity7 , the shift reflects a closer alignment with the country 's historic embrace of freedom from the government			1
the " family values " efforts to legislate morality run counter to that libertarian notion of freedom			1
liberals have always been more comfortable with the differences between people			0
and conservatives are increasingly redefining their stance on a number of social issues , concluding that different people can live different lives			2
the government should not interfere			0
there are many other factors , of course			0
activists have worked persistently to educate the public			2
and the entertainment industry has played an important role			0
and the changes in @entity7 are echoes of a global trend			2
@entity241 , affluent countries tend to be more accepting of different lifestyle choices			0
homosexuality is gaining acceptance in the @entity245 , while it is overwhelmingly condemned in @entity247 countries , and in @entity248			0
the western world 's attitude toward drugs is changing			0
" @entity254 " drugs and addiction are seen more as a disease than a moral failing			0
marijuana , once demonized , is increasingly viewed as less harmful than alcohol			0
there are many areas in which progressive @entity262 nations , such as the @entity19 , are still sharply different from the @entity7			1
differences over gun policy will likely persist , while views over contentious topics such as the right to die are likely to converge			0
for @entity7 , the driving force behind the transformation is found in a changing definition of the meaning of freedom			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity275 .			0

@entity277 : the @entity19 once seemed permissive to @entity7 on pot , same - sex marriage
but changes in public opinion , laws have narrowed social gap in the two countries
she says " family values " stance *conflicted* with libertarian notion of freedom
@entity293 : @entity7 differs with many nations on gun issue , but definition of freedom shifting
