can complaining too much get you booted from a frequent flier program ? it 's one of the questions at the heart of a lawsuit filed against @entity6 -- now owned by @entity7 -- by @entity8 , a rabbi who lives in @entity9 , @entity10 , and frequently travels to lecture and teach			1
@entity8 joined @entity6 's @entity12 frequent flier program in 1999 and reached @entity14 status in 2005			1
but in june of 2008 , @entity8 said a @entity6 representative called him and told him his status was being revoked " on the ground that he had ' abused ' the program , " according to court papers			1
@entity8 said the airline also took away the hundreds of thousands of miles accumulated in his account			2
" it did n't make sense			0
initially , when they contacted me on the phone i thought it was a prank call , " @entity8 said			2
" when i pushed for a reason and clarification , they told me it was because i was complaining too much			2
" in july 2008 , @entity6 sent the rabbi a letter noting that he had made 24 complaints in the past eight months , including nine incidents of his bag arriving late at the luggage carousel , according to court papers			1
" you have continually asked for compensation over and above our guidelines			0
we have awarded you $ 1,925.00 in travel credit vouchers , 78,500 @entity12 bonus miles , a voucher extension for your son , and $ 491.00 in cash reimbursements , " the letter states , according to court papers			0
" due to our past generosity , we must respectfully advise that we will no longer be awarding you compensation each time you contact us			0
" @entity8 's lawyers countered that the rabbi and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on @entity6 each year , and that @entity8 estimated that only about 10 % of the trips had resulted in a call to @entity6 's customer care			1
" i do n't think i was a frequent complainer , " @entity8 said			2
" they should have taken their time and analyzed : were my complaints legitimate ? should they be doing something to improve their service and quality of product ? instead of worrying , we 've got to shut up somebody who is complaining too much			0
" in november of 2008 , @entity6 sent @entity8 an e-mail , in which the airline quoted a paragraph from the fine print of the @entity76			1
it stated that @entity6 could determine " in its sole judgment " whether a passenger has abused the program , and that abuse " may result in cancellation of the member 's account and future disqualification from program participation , forfeiture of all mileage accrued and cancellation of previously issued but unused awards			1
" @entity8 sued for breach of contract in january of 2009 , but a @entity93 district court dismissed the class action suit , agreeing with @entity6 that the @entity95 preempted his claim			1
the act prohibits parties from bringing state law claims against airlines that relate to a " price , route , or service " of the carrier , according to court documents			0
the airline 's lawyers also argued that the @entity12 general terms and conditions did not require @entity6 to provide frequent fliers with lengthy explanations or reasons for its decision to terminate or demote a member 's status in the program			1
but last month , the 9th @entity118 reversed the lower court 's decision and ordered it to reconsider @entity8 's claims			1
it said that when @entity122 passed the @entity95 , it did not intend to " immunize the airline industry from liability for common law contract claims			0
" @entity7 did not respond to a request for comment , but the airline has requested a re-hearing in the case			0
@entity8 -- who is still a frequent flier , but is no longer loyal to any one airline -- said he is hoping to get his miles back , have his status reinstated and get fair compensation for what he 's gone through			2
" to me , it 's outright fraud			0
you ca n't take somebody 's mileage away when they 've accumulated it , " he said			0
" we live in a country that was built on freedom and this to me is a tremendous abuse of freedom			0
