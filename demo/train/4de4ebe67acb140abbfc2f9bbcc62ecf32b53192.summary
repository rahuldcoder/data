-- with the launch of an @entity3 for the @entity4 last week , @entity1 has proved that its all - in - one digital marketplace model -- so successful for the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 -- can flourish on old - fashioned laptop and desktop computers as well			1
developers with software ready for the store 's january 6 opening were met with throngs of click - happy customers			1
@entity4 users have appeared eager to spend money on apps , even for software that was previously available on the @entity21 and in brick - and - mortar stores			0
downloads on the first day exceeded 1 million -- out of a pool of about 1,000 apps , @entity1 said			1
distributed evenly , that works out to 1,000 downloads for each app , although name recognition and how @entity1 allocates promotion tend to skew results			1
but some development houses did gangbuster business			0
@entity34 , @entity1 's vice president for @entity6 software , said last year that the company 's @entity8 would spark " a whole new gold rush for app developers , " a prediction that must now apply to the @entity4 store as well			1
@entity3 winners one big winner from the @entity44 launch has been @entity45			1
the free note - taking app catalogs text and multimedia files ; synchronizes them over the internet to be accessed from phones , a website or desktop software ; and lets you search through them			0
@entity45 was downloaded 90,000 times on the @entity3 's opening day			1
that 's about a 10th of all apps purchased that day			1
it 's been consistently listed in the section of most popular apps			1
" having a well - formed app store is the most important part in getting attention , " @entity45 ceo @entity62 said			0
" we were on the @entity67 since that launched as well			0
we 've kind of been through this once before , so we had pretty high expectations of what being in an app store means for getting attention			0
" the @entity44 launch , @entity62 said , " exceeded our expectations			1
" being in the @entity44 helped expose @entity45 to 40,000 people who had never used it , he said			2
@entity45 has also benefited from @entity1 's promotional efforts in the store			1
it sometimes gets top billing in a rotating list of featured apps , similar to the top section of the @entity84			0
@entity1 spokeswoman @entity85 also listed @entity45 among the top five " must - have " apps , which is determined by consistent top performers in downloads and ratings			1
another @entity44 hit is @entity91 , no. 7 on the must - have list			2
@entity93 , the maker of that free drawing program , says the store " effectively doubled " the number of people using the professional version of @entity91 on opening day			2
the company declined to provide exact figures			0
@entity101 costs $ 30 on the @entity44 , versus almost $ 70 on @entity102			2
it 's now among @entity1 's highest - grossing apps			1
a lucrative business model @entity1 takes a 30 % cut of app sales , which makes its app stores a lucrative business for the company as well as developers			2
because of this success , the stores are facing increased competition from @entity116 's popular @entity115 , a forthcoming @entity102 app store and other rivals			1
this week , @entity118 contested @entity1 's trademark request for the term " app store			1
" free applications benefit from the app store exposure too , even though they do n't help @entity1 's business as directly			1
for example , @entity125 is also on the @entity1 must - have list			2
the social networking company launched on the store with its first official desktop client , based on work by the engineer who made the @entity6 app. a @entity125 spokeswoman said the company is " pleased " with the results but declined to say how many times the free app had been downloaded			2
the @entity3 program is included as part of a software update for @entity4 computers running the newest version of the operating system , called @entity145			0
further enhancements to the app model will come as part of @entity149 , which is scheduled to go on sale this summer			0
previously , @entity4 software could be found on vendors ' websites or in stores ( in cardboard boxes , no less ; how quaint )			0
for developers , submitting an application to @entity1 for sale in the @entity44 can be easier than getting their software on a retailer 's shelf , which can require complex business deals			1
it is also easier to sell through an established app store than through a developer 's own website , which can require building payment mechanisms and systems for licensing customers ' copies			2
@entity4 owners like the store because it makes software easier to find , manages what 's been downloaded , makes it easy to move apps between computers and provides alerts when a new version is available			1
some software makers complain that @entity1 's rules about what it will accept are too stringent and that the company takes too big a cut of revenue			1
but @entity1 does n't bar developers from distributing their wares in other locations on the @entity21			2
pros and cons but are these early success stories sustainable ? @entity192 , a simple utility that helps prevent the computer from automatically going into sleep mode ( get it ? ) , did exceedingly well early on			1
the app has been downloaded more than 135,000 times			0
about one - third of those sales came on launch day ; as for other apps , they have tapered somewhat since			2
while daily downloads are decreasing steadily for caffeine at a pace of about 30 % per day , the app continues to attract new customers at a rate several times greater than anytime since it came out four years ago			1
" the @entity3 opens up the opportunity to sell 99 - cent apps , which was previously not really feasible , and i think that could bring a lot of new smaller apps , " caffeine developer @entity208 said			0
" it 's a lot easier when they handle hosting and payment for you			0
" i 'd say i 'm a believer " in the app - store model , he wrote			0
" the @entity3 makes downloaded software easy for regular people , and it turns out there are a lot of regular people out there ! " however , not every company has the @entity228 for launching app stores			0
@entity116 , which produced a hit with its android market , has drummed up minimal interest in its @entity233			0
@entity235 co-founder @entity234 is n't sold on the app - store concept			0
at an event in @entity239 , @entity237 spoke out against the idea of app stores , calling them " a threat to a diverse and open ecosystem , " according to blog reports			0
a magic formula ? but many developers seem convinced that @entity1 has hit on the right formula			2
@entity249 had been planning to build a weather - report app for the @entity8 or @entity6			0
the product manager for @entity252 immediately changed course when he heard @entity1 ceo @entity254 unveil plans for the @entity44 in october			1
" there 's so much competition in the regular @entity3 , " @entity249 said of @entity1 's mobile software store and its 300,000 apps			1
" i thought if we could be there on day one in the @entity44 , we could rise above the noise			1
@entity252 was on track to get 100,000 downloads in its first week			2
the developers are making money from ads , which had been shown 2 million times in six days			0
" we would not have come out with a @entity4 app first if not for the ( @entity4 ) @entity3 , " @entity249 said			0
and for the 61 - person team at @entity45 , the @entity3 is something of a blessing			0
" we do n't have experts here that think about logistics or channels or distribution or advertising , " said @entity62 , the @entity45 ceo			0
@entity45 had the distribution method in place on its site , but that was created out of necessity , said @entity62 , who was happy to let @entity1 take the reins on managing server infrastructure and promotion			1
" before , you used to make a great product , but no one would ever get it or use it or be able to buy it , " he said			0
" the app stores have made the software business more of a meritocracy than it 's ever been , which really favors geeks like us			0

@entity1 launched the @entity44 a week ago , *spawning* success stories
like @entity305 for other platforms , it 's a central place for finding and managing apps
the store was met with 1 million downloads in its first day
