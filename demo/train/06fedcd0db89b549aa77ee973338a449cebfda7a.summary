@entity0 -- mobile technology is no longer limited to laptops , smartphones and tablets			1
it 's seeping into every corner of our lives , including television and movies , cars , the workplace , health care , education and eventually our bodies			0
this expansion of mobile , and its next generation of highly mobile tech users , were the subject of monday 's @entity23 keynote			1
delivered by chip maker @entity26 's chief executive @entity25 , the talk marked the official kickoff of the show , which opens its doors tuesday morning			1
the @entity23 keynote address was previously handled by @entity31 , a company whose products are instantly familiar to consumers around the world			1
@entity26 is n't a household name , even though it says it has shipped 11 billion chips in its 27 years and its mobile processors power the mobile devices you use everyday			1
the challenge for @entity26 on monday was to illustrate how its technology is relevant to regular consumers			1
the resulting talk was as scattered and entertaining as its rooster of special guest stars , which included " @entity57 's " @entity49 , archbishop @entity50 ( via video ) , filmmaker @entity52 , @entity54 driver @entity53 , " @entity58 " actress @entity55 and pop band @entity56			1
but the biggest guest star for this tech audience may have been @entity31 ceo @entity61 , who ran out on stage to giddily show off three new @entity64 products			2
5 fun and odd gadgets from @entity23 the event kicked off with a skit featuring young actors playing stereotypes of the most annoying people you 've ever been stuck behind in a @entity74 line			1
an @entity76 - spouting popular girl , a gamer geek who talks like a surfer and a @entity80 wannabe entrepreneur			0
what tied these characters together was the theme of the event : they were all " born mobile			0
" the primarily mobile phenomenon is international			0
according to @entity25 , 84 % of people worldwide say they ca n't go a day without their mobile device			2
the smartphone interface is so commonplace , people now want it on their other devices			0
the @entity95 mobile operating system is already expanding beyond smartphones and tablets to smart tvs , cameras and @entity102 's @entity101 smart glasses			2
@entity26 's chips have an even broader reach , appearing in smart tvs , game consoles , home automation devices and even cars			2
during its keynote @entity26 showed how its technology can be used to enable wireless charging for electric vehicles			1
the tech industry assumes that eventually , everything will be connected to the @entity115 , with cars , household appliances and mobile devices all communicating with each other			0
the concept , called the " @entity115 , " has been kicking around for many years , but a recent boom in low - cost sensors and popular gadgets like the nest smart thermostat have led to more gadgets that successfully add web connectivity			0
for example , wearable health monitors could be used to notify you or your doctor as soon as something is wrong with your vital signs			0
trends to watch at @entity23 " it 's really going to empower us by giving us more information about ourselves and our environment , " said @entity25 , who said most people look at their phones 150 times a day			1
even in the present , mobile phones are changing people 's lives and behaviors			0
in developing countries , where a phone is many people 's first and only device , phones are being used to deliver basic heath care			0
augmented reality apps , like those powered by @entity26 's @entity156 platform , are being used to help children learn to read			0
@entity26 also used the keynote to announce two new processors , the @entity161 and 800			2
most people who will benefit from the faster , more energy - efficient chips probably wo n't know their names			0
but with this keynote , @entity26 hopes to make a name for itself as a innovative company powering the mobile tech of the future .			1
