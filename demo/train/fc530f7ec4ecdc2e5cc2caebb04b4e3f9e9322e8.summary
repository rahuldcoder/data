-- if our children 's children should die from @entity5 here in the @entity7 , president @entity1 would be to blame			1
that is a sentiment i found in numerous comments on @entity5 articles that i came across on the @entity13			2
after a while i stopped reading , convinced that if president @entity1 found a cure for cancer , these would be the people who would blame him for putting doctors out of work			1
that was before sen. @entity22 , an @entity24 @entity23 and a member of the @entity26 rumored to have 2016 aspirations , stepped up on friday and said , " unfortunately this is another example where the administration was not as engaged early on as they should have been and now we 're playing catch - up			0
" then sunday , @entity32 , head of the @entity34 , said , " people today do n't feel better off than they were five years ago , and obviously whether it 's the @entity37 , the @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity5 , the @entity40 , i mean what 's going well in regard to this administration and those senators who have followed this president lockstep ? " that 's when it was clear : a lot of president @entity1 's critics are blaming him for @entity5			1
i guess if some religious conservatives can blame @entity52 on gay marriage then certainly there is room to lay blame for the outbreak of @entity5 on the steps of the @entity58			2
especially if you 're comfortable with ignoring reality and rejecting facts			2
opinion : get proactive about screening for @entity5 how can president @entity1 's response be characterized as negligent when his administration began directing resourcesâ € ” including more than $ 21 million from the @entity67 -- to areas hit with the virus within days of the first @entity5 diagnosis ? that was in march			1
on april 1 , according to the @entity73 , the spread was " relatively small still			0
" since then , the @entity1 administration has committed an additional $ 175 million and sent 3,000 troops to @entity76 to combat the crisis			1
this comes on top of the largest international response in the history of the @entity82			0
when you look at the timeline , it would appear the @entity1 administration has been leading the fight against the spread of the disease since last winter			2
and yet , what does @entity89 have to say ? " it 's being treated and dealt with in the most irresponsible , incompetent manner i can think of			0
" opinion : protecting against @entity5 trumps liberty which is either a confession that @entity89 is having trouble thinking or just another example of a @entity23 mouthpiece refusing to let reality get in the way of a good narrative , especially when we 're so close to the midterm election			1
@entity89 's proclamation is particularly outrageous considering he lived through the @entity107 epidemic in the @entity7			1
for those who do n't remember that timelineâ € ” which obviously includes @entity89 -- the first cases were discovered in 1981			0
by february 1984 , the @entity82 stated there were more than 4,100 cases in the @entity7 and nearly 2,000 people had already died			0
president @entity114 did n't publicly address the disease until may 1987			2
by then more than 20,000 @entity7 had died and the virus had spread to more than 100 countries			0
i would think in the lexicon of irresponsible and incompetent manners to address a public health crisis , @entity114 comes out on top			2
the @entity114 administration 's response to @entity107 was not only painfully slow , then - press secretary @entity123 even made jokes about people dying			1
compared to the way @entity114 handled @entity107 , @entity1 's response to @entity5 should be praised			1
when he went to the @entity130 in september , he told world leaders , " we are not moving fast enough			0
" this is a month after @entity73 declared the @entity5 outbreak a public health emergency and before the diagnosis of an infected man in @entity138			0
opinion : ebola quarantine is perfectly legal with democrats in the @entity142 against the ropes , giddy @entity23 hoping for a red november can not be bothered with facts no matter how egregious their rhetoric to the contrary may be			0
so , @entity23 party leaders and promoters go out and proclaim president @entity1 , the man whose signature piece of legislation is designed to provide preventive care , is doing little to prevent the spread of a deadly disease , and hope voters buy it			1
i guess when you have people hating president @entity1 they 'll believe just about anything bad said about him , even if it 's ridiculous			1
case in point : at a summer fundraiser for former @entity23 rep. @entity166 of @entity167 , an attendee said , " i personally believe that @entity1 is a muslim ... and i believe that he is doing everything in his power to bring this country down			0
" @entity166 seized the opportunity to fan those flames by first insinuating that @entity1 said as much , followed by , " the president has an @entity177 orientation " using his own affinity for @entity180 football to support his claim against @entity1			2
i felt a little dumber after watching the exchange , and yet no one in the audience seemed to mind			0
all of which explains why some @entity23 are now out blaming @entity1 for @entity5			1
it may not be true , but it 's still great for business .			0

@entity189 : a lot of president @entity1 's critics are blaming him for @entity5
@entity193 : these critics ignore reality and reject facts , and want to bash @entity1 at every chance
he says @entity1 directed resources to combat @entity5 crisis from the very beginning
@entity193 : compared to way @entity114 handled @entity107 crisis , @entity1 *deserves* praise
