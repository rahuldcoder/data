-- while those about him have lost their heads , @entity2 captain @entity1 has been a model of consistency			1
whether it is players falling foul of the law , refusing to play , or simply getting swept up by the revolving door at the club 's @entity12 , @entity1 has seen a number of teammates and managers come and go during his five years in @entity17			1
but the @entity18 has led the line for @entity2 both on and off the pitch			1
the 27 - year - old is captain of both club and country and his leadership helped @entity2 clinch a first @entity27 championship in 44 years in 2012			1
his stellar performances and articulate interviews have made @entity1 an idol among fans and a respected figure within the media			1
@entity1 's level head is something he credits to his education and his parents , who kept him grounded even when it became clear he was destined for sporting stardom			2
" i could n't go anywhere without finishing my studies , " @entity1 told @entity0 reflecting on the years he spent combining football and his education			1
" i always remember playing in big games , millions of people watching , and the next day coming back at two o'clock in the morning			0
" at eight o'clock i was just sitting on the bench with all my classmates and i was just a normal guy , but it 's always given me the right balance			0
" i thank my mother every day and my father every day for pushing me in that direction			0
they 've never ever said to me , ' you 're a great footballer			0
you 've made it now just focus on your football			2
' " they 've always said keep other things at hand and i guess i still have this in my life now			0
" blog : is @entity63 worth $ 120m ? @entity1 's present is a far cry from his parents ' past			2
his parents fled @entity69 , now known as @entity70 , during the regime of president @entity72 , heading to @entity18 where @entity1 was born and raised			1
" they 've given us so much love when we were younger , but i guess like any modern family as well , we 've had our problems in the fight , " said @entity1 of his parents			2
" we 've had financial difficulties like any normal family would have , but i think that the biggest lesson for me is that we 've always come back to that education , the strength to do our own thing ... knowing that we would be okay even if we did n't have any money because we knew exactly how to handle situations			0
" despite the success he has enjoyed since signing for @entity2 in 2008 , @entity1 continues to have numerous extracurricular interests			1
@entity91 newspaper the @entity89 reported in january 2012 that @entity1 had signed up for a three - year business administration course , while he also purchased a football club in his hometown and renamed it @entity95			1
the team , which plays at the bottom level of the @entity18 football pyramid , is @entity1 's attempt to ensure up and coming players are given the best possible start to their careers			1
" i played football for @entity104 from the age of 6 to the age of 20 so that has had a big impact on my life , at the same time as my parents and the schools i went to , " he explained			2
" i really believe that the interactions between all of those different assets led me to be better			0
" i want to make a very strong link into the schools , maybe sometimes even the life at home for the kids			0
" i think a part of the reason why a lot of young kids fail is because they do n't have the support from home that they need to			0
" one obstacle faced by some modern footballers is racism			2
the key to tackling discrimination , according to @entity1 , is also education			1
while @entity133 pays little heed to the abusers , he still says it is important for the game 's governing bodies to clamp down on the vocal minority			0
" it 's a very sad life , it 's a very sad way of behaving so i would n't give them too much attention , " he added			0
" but at the same time , as much as i would n't teach my kids to give them too much attention , i hope the governing bodies will be extremely hard and extremely exemplary in the way that they deal with those situations			0
