-- on wednesday night , @entity1 , a @entity3 team hailing from the country 's second city of @entity6 , and @entity8 's @entity7 will play a @entity10 fifth place play - off in an unseasonably wet and no doubt half - empty stadium in @entity13 , capital of the @entity14			1
there are arguably few fixtures in international club football that come as obscure as the match up between the surprise champions of @entity20 and @entity22 's amateur representatives			2
in the hierarchy of the game , the match - up will barely register a second look amongst the sport 's elite			1
but the match holds huge significance , not just in both of the respective countries , but by also performing an invaluable service for world football : giving a much needed leg - up to football 's outsiders			2
the tournament has long been seen as an inconvenience to the fans of the top @entity40 teams , thanks to the fact that it falls in the middle of the domestic season			0
the schedules have been tweaked accordingly : @entity46 will be parachuted in for the semi-finals , needing only two games to win the title			0
yet for the poorer teams from far - flung confederations , the @entity10 offers those on the fringes a chance to shine against some of the world 's top clubs and earn prize money that would take decades to earn in their home continents			1
" @entity8 qualified for the @entity10 , now we 've won our first game at the @entity10 so it has been a great year for @entity8 football , " said @entity7 goalkeeper @entity61 after his team beat @entity64 's @entity63 in their first round match , an amazing feat for a club that does n't have a single professional player			1
the victory followed @entity8 's two - leg intercontinental play - off against @entity73 , which saw the @entity74 qualify for @entity20 2010			1
for @entity61 , who was in the @entity74 ' squad , both that qualification and the @entity10 victory gives football in @entity8 , a country dominated by rugby , a huge lift back home			1
more importantly , it gives the players a chance to show off their skills to @entity40 scouts			0
" this tournament gives us amazing exposure that millions of players would die for			0
i 've just heard a couple of rumors that some of the boys were being looked at by @entity95 clubs , " he said			0
but the largest impact comes from the sheer scale of the money involved			0
for winning the @entity99 , the @entity99 , @entity7 received nothing			1
the total prize pot in @entity13 , however , is $ 16.5 million			0
even coming last guarantees $ 500,000 , but their heroics against @entity63 , followed by a tough 3 - 0 defeat to @entity106 's @entity105 , means they will now pocket at least $ 1million , even if they lose to @entity1			1
" the money allows us a bit more freedom			0
it means i can travel for trials abroad which can be expensive , " explained @entity61 , who splits his time playing for @entity112 and studying for a joint honors law and political science degree			0
" it is a fantastic relief for amateur clubs			0
" @entity1 have also overcome large obstacles to get to @entity13			2
when the team broke @entity122 's recent dominance to win the @entity123 this year , it marked the return of @entity3 ( @entity125 ) football to the top of the @entity129 game			1
more than 40 years ago they were considered one of the best teams on the continent reaching four @entity99 finals between 1967 and 1970 and winning two of them			0
but two brutal wars , the second of which took more lives than any conflict since @entity140 , an estimated 5.4 million according to a 2008 @entity142 mortality survey , destroyed almost every aspect of civil society and decimated its sporting infrastructure			0
" there were many times my life was at risk , it was a difficult time			0
with the end of the war i am happy that there is now peace , " said @entity151 , the side 's captain who is currently considered one of the best players in @entity20 following a nomination for the 2009 @entity156 @entity155 and finishing top scorer in the @entity123 in 2007 and 2008			2
@entity1 will benefit handsomely from their appearance in @entity13 , even after narrowly losing to @entity165 's @entity164 2 - 1			1
the prize money for winning the @entity123 is $ 950,000			1
in comparison a win on wednesday , which will secure fifth place , will clinch the @entity3 side $ 1.5 million			1
yet the attack - minded midfielder sees the team 's international success as more than just the pursuit of footballing glory and financial gain			0
" football is a huge factor for development in @entity20 , in @entity3 especially , " he said			1
" people love football so much , it unifies even in times of war			2
to win , win , win all the time can only be a good thing			0
the greatest feeling was in the [ @entity129 ] @entity99 , to be united in the football stadium to see all the fans come to support			0
" the stadium on wednesday night might well only contain a smattering of truly die - hard football fans , and few in @entity40 will care who comes fifth and sixth in a minor footnote on the international football calendar			2
but for millions of fans in @entity3 and @entity8 , not to mention those that will aspire to take their places next year , wednesday night will be anything but an irrelevance			1
" it has been the dream of my career to play at the @entity10 , " said @entity151 , who has begun to attract the attentions of @entity205 clubs			1
" it will be a great moment , a great challenge , but i have the support of all the @entity3 people behind me			2

@entity10 will see a fifth place play - off between @entity1 and @entity7
the tournament offers smaller nations the chance to shine on the global stage
the prize money for finishing last on a par with winning major continental honors
