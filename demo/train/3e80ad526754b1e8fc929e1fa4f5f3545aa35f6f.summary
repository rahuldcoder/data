-- @entity1 have returned to the top of the @entity3 after a header from @entity5 gave them a narrow 1 - 0 win over previous table - toppers @entity8			1
the only goal of a largely disappointing match came just before half - time when @entity5 superbly adjusted his body to divert @entity14 's deflected cross past 20 - year - old @entity8 goalkeeper @entity15 , who was making his league debut for the @entity18 side			1
neither team found their top form in a game of mistimed passes and niggly tackling , but @entity1 had the best of the chances with @entity27 striker @entity26 missing a golden opportunity to stretch the advantage in the 73rd minute			2
@entity8 defender @entity30 was adjudged to have handled the ball in the penalty area but @entity26 's spot - kick flew high and wide of the visitors goal			2
@entity36 manager @entity35 brought on big - name players @entity37 and captain @entity39 , who was returning from injury , in an attempt to get back into the game			0
but their flowing passing football deserted them and it was @entity1 who nearly snatched a second goal late on , when @entity26 's clever lob was superbly clawed away by @entity15			0
the result means @entity1 now lead the table by two points on 34 points and remain unbeaten after 16 league matches			1
they also have a game in hand on all their rivals			0
@entity8 are two points behind in second , level on points with @entity61 , while defending champions @entity62 are another point behind in fourth position .			0

@entity1 return to the top of the @entity3 table
a header from @entity5 gives them a 1 - 0 *victory* over @entity8 at @entity73
@entity1 remain unbeaten and are now two points ahead of @entity8 in second place
