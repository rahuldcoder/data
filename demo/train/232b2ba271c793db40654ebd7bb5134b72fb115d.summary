-- in practical terms , it might seem that the recent arrests of key @entity5 members and the success of the @entity8 offensive in southern @entity9 might indicate a new phase in the war against the @entity5			1
but how the @entity5 respond will be based on a world view and beliefs far different from the @entity8 perspective and that of the @entity18 - educated @entity9 and @entity17 elites , whom we rely on for strategic advice and partnership			0
on tuesday , @entity17 authorities confirmed the capture of mullah @entity25 , a member of the @entity5 's inner circle and a leading military commander against the @entity8 in eastern @entity9			0
@entity25 's arrest by the @entity17 closely follows that of @entity30 , the @entity5 's operational commander and likely second - in - command to @entity33			2
with the @entity8 offensive based in @entity36 going well , @entity8 officials are privately hopeful that the latest developments will push the @entity5 to the negotiating table			0
could the @entity5 be nearing a point where they would consider a negotiated end to the war , severing their more than decade - long alliance with @entity43 and @entity44 ? having interviewed @entity5 fighters and leaders , including two who are close to @entity33 , it seems likely that the @entity5 themselves do not know the answer to this question			1
in the world of @entity33 and the @entity5 leaders , many are driven by the power of religious visions and dreams			1
each " true night dream " is nothing less than a prophecy of @entity59			1
and their leaders ' authority comes from @entity59			0
according to the @entity5 members i interviewed over the past two years , @entity33 and his top followers retreated to @entity67 , a @entity17 border city , after the initial @entity8 victory in @entity9 at the end of 2001			1
as recounted to me , @entity33 was devastated by the @entity5 's defeat			2
paralyzed with inaction , @entity33 could not decide what to do , waiting patiently for a " true night dream " from @entity59 to tell him or at least one of his trusted followers			1
it was not until a @entity5 deputy recounted a dream , in the spring of 2002 , in which he saw @entity33 's " beard turn a blinding white -- for it was now made of the threads of the holy prophet 's very cloak " that @entity33 decided to lead the fight again against the @entity8 inside @entity9			1
i was told that it was @entity33 's own " true night dream " -- where a mountain was about to fall on him when @entity92 appeared in the shape of a man -- that led him first to wear the holy relic of the cloak of the @entity90			1
the seminal event in sealing @entity33 's authority as the @entity5 's unquestioned leader happened when @entity33 donned , from a religious shrine in @entity99 , @entity90 's cloak			2
" simply by standing in the holy cloak 's presence , the mute have walked out speaking , the blind seeing , but only when a true leader from @entity59 stands before it , will the holy cloak come out , " a @entity5 leader told me			0
in the past 100 years , the cloak only " came out " when the legendary @entity109 wore it to save @entity9 in 1929 and in efforts to stop a cholera epidemic in 1935			0
" the prophet 's cloak can be opened only when touched by a true leader of the faithful , " another @entity5 official told me			0
" @entity33 had the right touch			0
so , @entity92 almighty opened the locked chests for him to wear the very cloak worn by the @entity90 , and be proclaimed leader of the faithful			0
" @entity33 's authority among his followers has continued to be based on " true night dreams , " or ruya , that he and those in his closest circle receive			1
" and we know , " the @entity5 official told me , " that whoever sees @entity92 in a dream surely has seen him , since @entity133 can not impersonate him in a true dream			2
" whether the @entity8 offensive against the @entity5 is successful , we would be wrong to assume that the @entity5 's actions will rationally follow battlefield realities			0
@entity33 and the @entity5 leadership may be willing to negotiate with the @entity8 , or they may simply fight to the last man			2
the recent arrests of key leaders of the @entity5 will undoubtedly put pressure on them			1
but @entity33 and many around him see the world in less practical terms			0
ultimately , it may simply be that unless @entity33 has another dream that tells him to sever his alliance with @entity43 , the @entity5 will remain @entity44 's steadfast ally and never surrender or negotiate			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

@entity151 interviewed @entity5 leaders and fighters over two years
@entity151 : how @entity5 react to arrests of key leaders ca *n't* be *predicted*
@entity151 found @entity5 leaders rely on " true night dreams " to guide them
