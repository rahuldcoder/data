@entity0 , @entity1 -- a top adviser to @entity1 president @entity4 defended the regime 's actions tuesday , arguing that the government is not attacking peaceful protesters , despite widespread witness reports of a fierce crackdown against displays of dissent			1
" security forces are there against armed groups , " @entity13 told @entity2 in an interview , referring to the shadowy entities the regime has consistently said are responsible for the violence sweeping the @entity19 country since mid-march			2
" we 're not targeting demonstrators			0
i think peaceful demonstrators have made their point , and they are making their point every day			0
we have no problem with that			0
" @entity31 said the government would like " to talk to peaceful demonstrators " and is not opposed to peaceful protests			2
what it wants to do , she said , is " isolate armed militants			0
" she and other @entity1 government officials have not provided more detail about the armed groups and their financing			1
@entity31 said that while demonstrators have " legitimate grievances , " there are extremists who are using protests " as a cover to incite sectarian violence in @entity1 " and are badly hurting the economy			1
bloodshed has engulfed @entity1 ever since demonstrators took to the streets in the southern city of @entity53 to protest the arrests of young people for scribbling anti-government graffiti			1
witnesses reported a tough crackdown against the demonstrators			0
that sparked more protests and tough security reactions across the country			0
the videos and witness accounts filtering out of @entity1 of the security actions have spurred international outrage toward the regime			1
@entity68 , head of the @entity70 - based @entity69 , told @entity2 tuesday that 1,342 civilians and 343 security personnel have died since the protests erupted			2
@entity31 said tuesday that more than 500 police officers and government troops and police have been killed in the violence , in which " religious extremists " are " directing purposeful assassinations			1
" " they are the ones who are killing children , who are killing women , who are maiming people , who are cutting people into pieces , " she said , referring to the " extremists			2
" @entity2 can not independently verify the death tolls			0
however , sources in @entity92 and @entity93 can account for the many @entity1 who 've fled to their countries to escape violence			1
the @entity92 government said tuesday that 10,757 @entity1 refugees have crossed the border			1
it also said 441 @entity1 had returned to @entity1 voluntarily in the past two days			1
security sources in @entity93 told @entity2 that about 1,000 @entity1 have crossed into @entity93 near the town of @entity102			1
when asked whether the crisis would have been different had security forces not acted violently during the uprising 's start in @entity53 , @entity31 said she thinks " there are lots of fabrications about the security forces " and that many security forces were ordered not to carry weapons in @entity53			0
the @entity114 has ruled @entity1 since 1971 , with @entity4 taking power after the death of his father @entity117 in 2000			1
the government is dominated by the @entity120 minority in a country with a majority @entity123 population			2
alawites are an offshoot of @entity127			0
last week , @entity4 held out a promise of reforms and a " national dialogue " in a speech that was met with widespread skepticism			0
as international and domestic outrage festered , @entity1 's embattled government allowed a group of activists and intellectuals , including some it had previously jailed , to hold a conference on democratic reform monday at a @entity0 hotel			1
@entity142 spokeswoman @entity141 said tuesday that the @entity143 was " pleased " to see the @entity1 opposition was allowed to protest peacefully and has been given some " breathing space			1
" it was a " step in the right direction , but more needs to be done , " @entity141 said , adding that " a key element of @entity1 moving in the right direction will be that this continues to be the case			1
" @entity151 , a writer and onetime political prisoner , said " we must change this tyrannical regime to a democratic , civilian one " and explained that " how that transition happens is a question this conference is trying to address			1
" @entity151 said the conference would " not necessarily " find an answer to that question , " but that is the big question in this country now			0
" about 200 @entity1 dissidents gathered in the hotel ballroom , including several signatories of a 2005 declaration that called for a democratic transition			1
but some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as @entity4 tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests said the people in the hotel do n't necessarily speak for them			0
" the big question regarding this conference is , where are the young people ? " asked @entity175 , a pro-democracy activist based outside @entity1			1
" where are the people who are on the streets ? where are the voices of the people who are from @entity53 , or from @entity186 , or from @entity187 , or from @entity188 ? i think those are the voices that have been missed so far			0
" @entity31 acknowledged that those at the conference were not representative of the protesters on the streets			2
" that 's very true			0
and this is our biggest problem and our biggest challenge , " she said			0
" we are trying our best to reach the leaders of people on the street because we want to solve this problem in our country and move forward			0
" but she said the government wants to be all - inclusive in its reform efforts by inviting all social groups to participate in a dialogue			2
she argues that the government would not want to undermine that sense of national unity			2
" no government in the world would kill its own people , " she said			0
@entity2 's @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
