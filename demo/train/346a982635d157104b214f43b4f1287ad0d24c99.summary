@entity0 -- a low water level in a reactor building at the damaged @entity7 nuclear power plant in @entity8 may have exposed fuel rods and caused them to melt , the owner of the facility said thursday			1
@entity11 blamed the incident on a faulty gauge that monitors the water level in the pressure vessel in the no. 1 reactor building			1
" i would say at this point that the situation is not dangerous , " said @entity17 , a professor of nuclear engineering and mechanical engineering at the @entity20			0
the @entity23 had a similar response to the new details released by @entity11			1
" this is in no way alarming , " said @entity26 , senior media relations manager at the @entity28 - based institute			0
" it was anticipated that there was fuel damage in reactors 1 , 2 and 3			0
this is confirmation , " he said			0
" it 's a situation that 's going to develop over time , " with details continuing to emerge as nuclear plant workers gain more access to the reactors , @entity26 added			2
" this is going to evolve over months , maybe many months			0
" once the faulty gauge was reset , workers discovered thursday that the water level had dropped more than 3 feet ( 1 meter ) below the fuel rods , which need to be cooled by water to keep them from melting			1
@entity8 's @entity50 said there 's a high possibility that the fuel rods have melted and are now being cooled by water in the bottom of the pressure vessel			0
the company said it suspects there is a leak in the pressure vessel , since the water level was low despite the company pouring 150 tons of water a day on the no. 1 reactor to cool it			1
a march 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems at @entity7 , causing the three operating reactors to overheat			2
that compounded a natural disaster by spewing vast quantities of radioactive material into the atmosphere			0
workers have been able to install air filters inside the no. 1 reactor building to contain radioactive particles and have begun filling the primary containment shell around the reactor core with water in an attempt to draw heat off the core			1
the plan is to recirculate that water through a heat exchanger to cool it , said @entity86 , a spokesman for @entity11			1
similar plans are being considered for unit 2 , which also is thought to be leaking radioactive water , and unit 3 , where engineers noted a disturbing rise in the reactor 's temperature readings last week , @entity86 told @entity1			2
" first we have to tackle unit no. 1 , and we need to see if we can succeed , " he said			0
meanwhile , equipment that will be used to decontaminate water pooling in the plant 's basements is expected to arrive by mid-may			0
tens of thousands of tons of radioactive water have flooded the basements where the cooling systems were housed , making it impossible for workers get into the facilities			2
at this point , " the danger is more with the workers who deal with ( the leak ) than the public , " @entity17 said			1
decontaminating the water pooling in the plant 's basements is feasible , as long as the water stays contained , he added			0
to limit further possible spread of contamination beyond the evacuation zone around the nuclear plant , @entity8 's @entity117 on thursday decided to euthanize livestock in the zone			1
there is a no - entry zone within a 20 - kilometer radius of @entity7			1
" it is yet to be determined how and when they do ( the euthanizing ) , but we would cull livestock with the most painless way with permission of the owners of them , " a spokesman for the @entity7 prefectural government said			1
it 's unclear how many livestock survive in the zone , but before the disaster there were approximately 3,500 cows , 30,000 pigs , 440,000 chickens , 100 horses and an unknown number of sheep			2
with their owners having evacuated , the livestock have been left to fend for themselves			0
@entity1 's @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
