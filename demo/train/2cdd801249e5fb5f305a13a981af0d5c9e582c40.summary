-- there is no shortage of adjectives one can apply to airline seats : uncomfortable , bulky , cramped , outdated and -- from an airline 's point of view -- overpriced			1
it 's no wonder then that many carriers are looking to make a change			1
ditching the screens ? dr. @entity11 , ceo at @entity12 , notes that accommodating passengers ' personal devices has become an imperative , though one that few manufacturers have yet to address			1
" connectivity is no longer just an option , but a necessity , " he says			1
at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity20 last month , @entity19 unveiled their newest design in economy seating , called the @entity25			1
the new seat features a tablet pc holder , a " smart pocket " for stowing devices ( and protecting them from scratches ) and a power supply for charging			2
shedding pounds the @entity25 follows another vital trend ; at 10 kilograms per seat , it 's lighter than its predecessors			1
" fuel costs are extremely high these days -- this is just an accepted fact in the industry			2
as a result , every kilogram counts , " says @entity39 , director of @entity40 , an award - winning industrial design studio			2
the lightest chair on the market is made by relative newcomer @entity46 , a @entity48 company that has crafted a model made from titanium and composite materials			2
it weights just 4 kilograms			2
the company estimates the weight savings could translate into $ 500,000 of fuel savings per aircraft per year			2
according to @entity58 , @entity46 's ceo , the @entity57 savings are even more significant			1
" every aircraft we equip saves 1,200 tons of co2 per year			2
that 's the equivalent of planting 45,000 trees , " he says			0
" imagine if every airplane in the world signed on			0
it could completely change the global fuel emissions			1
" 2022 : cheap flights , more rail and hands - free cars get a convertible one particularly awkward feature of airline seats is their lack of versatility			1
they recline , and that 's about as adaptive as they get			0
@entity81 is hoping to change that with its new @entity83 seat , which won the premium class and vip category at the @entity86 this year			0
the @entity83 can be configured as a roomy @entity88 seat , or converted into a business class seat with a lie - flat bed and direct aisle access			0
" the core aim is to allow airlines to adjust their cabin capacity based on demand , " says @entity39			1
" flights from @entity97 to @entity98 might have a big need for @entity100 , for example , but if you use the same plane to fly to @entity106 , the demand for lie - flat seats could be a lot less			1
this design allows the airline to adapt , " he adds			0
the armrest of the future ? this is not the first year @entity113 has scooped up an award for its designs			0
the trademark paperclip armrest -- a dual - level version that grants both parties access -- has picked up several accolades over the years			0
unfortunately , there has n't been a lot of demand for the innovation , and its potential for a more democratic approach to elbow room			0
" i 've showed the design to a lot of manufactures , and they 'll say , ' oh , that 's nice , ' but there has n't been a lot of need for it			0
the issue is cost , " he says			0
though the concept may not catch on on planes , it could become a feature of seating on the ground			1
" it 's more likely to one day see ( the armrest ) in theaters and cinemas			0
there are fewer regulations on the ground than in the air , so there 's less resistance to new products , " he says			0
apparently this matters : airplane armrest for two turned around @entity159 has also been experimenting with an alternate seating layout that could provide passengers with substantially more legroom ( a 31 - inch pitch instead of the more standard 27 - inch )			1
the hd 31 concept would feature two forward - facing seats sandwiching a single backward - facing seat			1
according to @entity169 , an executive vice president at @entity159 , the layout has , " raised a lot of interest			0
" " it provides a larger space for the shoulders while enabling the airline to board the same number of passengers , " he says .			0

airlines are seeking seating innovations
seats are getting lighter , comfier and more versatile
lighter seats could save airlines *billions* , and slash @entity57 emissions
