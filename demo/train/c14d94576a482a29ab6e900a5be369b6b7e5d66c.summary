-- former @entity2 defensive coordinator @entity1 will appeal his convictions on numerous counts of child sexual abuse , a member of his defense team says			1
after a trial that featured emotional and often graphic testimony from eight of @entity1 's victims , jurors late friday convicted him of 45 of the 48 sexual abuse counts he faced , involving a total of 10 victims			1
painful chapter closes with @entity1 conviction the eight victims who testified , now young men , said that they were boys when @entity1 forced them to engage in sexual acts with him			1
the acts occurred , they said , in showers in @entity2 's athletic facilities ; hotel rooms ; and the basement of @entity1 's home , among other places			1
the abuse spanned more than 15 years			2
praise for victims , jurors after @entity1 verdict after being found guilty , @entity1 , 68 , was taken immediately to the jail in @entity33 , @entity34			1
judge @entity35 said friday he will be sentenced in about 90 days			1
he likely will be sentenced to serve the rest of his life behind bars			0
@entity39 : share your reaction @entity1 's defense team plans to file a motion for appeal , claiming he had ineffective counsel , defense attorney @entity42 said sunday			1
under @entity34 law , that motion can not be filed until after sentencing			0
if @entity35 agrees to a hearing on the motion , lead defense attorney @entity50 would step aside and appear as a witness , the attorney said			1
@entity42 said either he or another attorney would argue the motion			0
the appellate claim will be based on @entity50 's " talking to the media , " @entity42 said			0
and a linchpin of the appeal will be prosecutor @entity59 's statements during his closing argument , when he told jurors that @entity1 could have proclaimed his innocence during an interview with @entity65 's @entity64			1
that violates @entity1 's right to post-arrest trial silence , @entity42 said			1
@entity42 said he will ask @entity35 to sentence @entity1 to serve concurrent sentences , with the maximum being 20 years			1
at the very least , he said , he hopes to get @entity35 to acknowledge the good works @entity1 has done in his life			1
@entity1 has a right to speak during sentencing , something @entity42 said will be discussed in the coming weeks			1
@entity42 said on saturday that he and @entity50 attempted to withdraw from the case before the trial , telling @entity35 the day before jury selection began that they did not feel adequately prepared and that it would be " unethical " for them to move forward			1
@entity35 denied their request , he said			0
@entity42 said he did not mention the issue earlier because a gag order was in place			0
@entity1 's pastor addresses conviction from pulpit if @entity35 denies the appeal motion , it would be likely to become part of a broader appeal , @entity42 said			1
ineffective counsel is a common appeal tactic , but a broader appeal may cite other reasons as well			1
" if you win on one of the appeal issues , everything probably falls , " @entity50 said last week			0
" all we have to do is convince an appellate court that one of the issues we will raise is worthy of a reversal			0
" @entity42 earlier pointed to " a lot of unique legal issues where ( @entity35 ) made rulings that could be overturned -- not because they were , per se , wrong , but because the law in the area was so unclear			0
" asked about the appeal monday , @entity113 , spokesman for the @entity34 attorney general 's office , said , " we 're not going to fight the appellate process with press releases			2
we 're confident that everything in the trial was handled appropriately			0
" @entity42 acknowledged sunday an appeal may present a tough challenge , as attorneys would have to prove they have significant evidence that could have altered the trial 's outcome			2
and @entity35 could easily rule that evidence presented at trial was so overwhelming -- the victims ' testimony , for instance -- that it would not have changed the end result , @entity42 said			0
despite widespread speculation , @entity1 did not take the stand in his own defense			1
@entity50 said after the verdict that decision was made because @entity1 's adopted son , @entity138 , was prepared to testify as a rebuttal witness that he , too , was sexually abused by @entity140			2
as of saturday , @entity1 was on what is commonly called suicide watch , @entity42 said			2
that was not an indication that @entity1 is suicidal , he added , but @entity35 and the jail warden just wanted " to put the precautions in place first and then evaluate later			2
" the former coach will be classified at @entity34 's @entity150 diagnostic facility before he is likely sent to a sex offender unit in the state prison system , @entity42 said			0
if he is sentenced to more than two years , the @entity153 would determine the prison where he would serve his time			0
sex abusers prey on kids ' trust , experts say beyond the appeals process , @entity1 could face more charges , perhaps tied to claims made by his adopted son or related to alleged sexual abuse that took place outside @entity33 -- including in hotel rooms in @entity167 and @entity168 , where some accusers say they accompanied him to @entity2 bowl games			1
the university itself also still faces fallout from the case , which shook @entity2 and raised questions about its response to the abuse allegations			0
two former administrators -- vice president @entity180 and athletic director @entity181 -- are awaiting trial on charges of perjury and failing to report abuse			2
prosecutors said the two did not notify police after former graduate student and football assistant @entity189 told them he saw @entity1 sodomizing a boy in a @entity2 shower in 2001			2
authorities did n't learn about @entity189 's account until years later			0
it led to the ouster of iconic head football coach @entity197 and university president @entity198			0
@entity197 died shortly afterward of lung cancer			0
' the @entity1 8 ' describe seduction , molestation and betrayal in addition to the testimony from @entity189 and a former janitor at @entity2 , several victims said they were repeatedly molested on university property			2
how the @entity1 case unfolded in a statement released friday night after the verdict , the school signaled it wants to seek resolution -- hinting that might include a financial settlement -- with the victims			2
" the university wants to provide a forum where the university can privately , expeditiously and fairly address the victims ' concerns and compensate them for claims relating to the university , " the statement said			0
@entity0 's @entity225 and @entity227 's @entity226 contributed to this report .			0
