among the casualties of conflict in @entity5 , the travails of a @entity2 whiskey distiller have barely registered			0
" the sanctions are having an effect now , " says @entity7 , who leads @entity8 in @entity9 , until recently one of the single - malt specialist 's best markets			1
" customers are having to negotiate with banks , some of which have been targeted ... everyone is watching the ruble on a daily basis to decide when to place orders			0
" " the @entity9 are coming to us asking if we can help at this difficult time , asking if we can reduce prices or extend credit			2
we are trying to be as flexible as we can , " he said			0
pressure to retreat @entity8 's commitment to @entity9 is in stark contrast to that of many western businesses in the wake of crisis in @entity36 , and the resurrection of @entity39 - era tensions			1
the imposition of sanctions by the @entity42 and the @entity43 , which includes a ban on transactions with many individuals and companies , and @entity9 counter-sanctions hitting foreign imports , have placed great strain on international businesses caught in the crossfire			1
giants in fields from energy to banking and car manufacturing such as @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 are reducing their presence , while major deals such as @entity64 's partnership with @entity65 have been put on ice			0
their flight has been spurred by falling oil prices that have wiped half the value from the ruble inside a year			0
companies fear the consequences of non-compliance with the western sanction regime , which is both complex and ever - changing , placing greater risk on trading with the sanctioned country			2
" it is an extra layer of care that companies must take , " says @entity78 , head of the @entity79 ( @entity79 )			0
" they have to employ risk analysts to study legislation -- and there is a lot of it from the @entity43 , @entity42 , and @entity9 -- and check that operations are not in breach			2
" taking advantage but @entity78 and the @entity79 are keen to emphasize that the @entity39 has not returned , that business between @entity9 and the @entity94 remains possible at this time , even advantageous			1
" before this , @entity9 was the @entity97 's fastest growing export market , due to the size of the market and the desire of a growing middle class with rising disposable incomes to buy @entity104 goods , " he said			1
" we work with the @entity97 government and the @entity9 embassy to ensure people are aware of the possibilities ... sanctions have impacted certain sectors but not all ; consumer goods , services , legal advice , construction -- much of what is needed for @entity117 2018 could come from @entity97			2
" @entity78 sees the current tension as temporary , partly due to the value of @entity9 as an export market while the @entity121 remains stagnant			1
such a thaw would reward companies that have withstood the pressure and remained , he predicts , as loyalty is highly prized in @entity9 business culture			1
the @entity127 think tank " @entity134 " has a more ambitious vision : to challenge the concept of trade sanctions that it believes hurt @entity42 businesses more than foreign political leaders			0
" the @entity42 has been the most aggressive country for sanctioning			0
since @entity138 it has been almost the only tool of diplomacy with an offending country , " says ceo @entity136			0
" the consequences fall on @entity42 companies , in terms of cost of compliance , lost sales , and an altered strategic environment			2
" @entity134 and the coalition of businesses it represents is lobbying policymakers to make sanctions hit individuals rather than companies , and in turn their @entity42 trading partners			0
it extends this principle even to avowedly hostile regimes , such as @entity157 and @entity158 , on the basis that relations between businesses would not endorse political leaders			2
@entity136 claims there is increasing sympathy among officials for a paradigm shift			0
opportunities in @entity158 @entity158 , subject to the harshest international sanctions that have seen @entity97 banks fined billions of dollars , could also offer lucrative opportunities for foreign investors			1
" @entity158 potentially offers a large and underpenetrated market for foreign business , " says @entity172 , of the @entity173			1
" if sanctions are lifted under a long - term deal , @entity158 could become a strategic priority for many businesses			1
" the opportunities are rich and diverse in an economy worth around $ 500 billion , @entity172 believes : " early interest is coming from automotive companies , suppliers of aircraft and industrial parts , and general retail and consumer goods as well as healthcare and pharmaceutical firms , with many companies drawing up business plans for how they can distribute their goods into the market			1
" " @entity195 and @entity196 have led car - manufacturers , given their past experience co-operating with the @entity158 producers , @entity200 and @entity201 , and would like to take @entity158 's annual vehicle production back from around 740,000 in the 2013/14 @entity158 year to the peak of 1.6 million reached in 2011			1
" ahead of the anticipated thaw , companies are already finding opportunities to position themselves in the new market , despite the continuing sensitivity over nuclear talks			0
seeking trade with a perceived adversary may be a high wire act , but in due course there are likely to be rewards for those who hold their nerve .			0

@entity104 companies are fleeing @entity9 - but could reap rewards from holding their ground
reduced *competition* in a lucrative market could offset the risks
@entity158 could soon become a " strategic priority for business "
