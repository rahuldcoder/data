@entity0 -- one of dr. @entity3 's girlfriends described tuesday a phone call with @entity3 that was suddenly interrupted with the " mumbling of voices " and coughing -- a moment prosecutors suggest is when the doctor realized there was a problem with @entity11			1
a @entity14 , @entity13 , cocktail waitress was one three @entity3 girlfriends called by the prosecution tuesday morning in the involuntary manslaughter trial of @entity18 , who was @entity11 's doctor			1
the @entity20 pharmacist who supplied dr. @entity3 with the drugs prosecutors contend killed @entity11 also testified in a court day that ended two hours early because of witnesses scheduling issues			1
@entity27 judge @entity26 limited how deep prosecutors could dig into @entity3 's social relationships with the women , but all three said they met @entity3 in @entity20 night clubs			1
a fourth woman testified monday she dated him after meeting in a @entity14 bar			0
the prosecution contends that one reason @entity3 is criminally responsible for @entity11 's death is because phone calls and text messages to these women , other patients and employees at his clinics caused him to ignore his patient while administering dangerous drugs			1
while the courtroom presence of the women may help prosecutors convince jurors about @entity3 's moral character , each of them offered important testimony about @entity3 's activities on june 25 , 2009 , the day @entity11 died			1
@entity53 testified that she met @entity3 at a @entity20 " social club " where she was working in february 2008			1
@entity3 sent @entity53 a cell phone text message at 8:35 a.m. the day @entity11 died , but the judge did not allow the prosecution to read it			2
judge @entity26 also would not let the jury hear a voice message @entity3 left on @entity53 's cell phone nine days earlier			2
but @entity53 did answer ' yes ' when asked if @entity3 had told her he hoped to " meet up with you " later at a club in @entity20 before he left for @entity65 with @entity11			1
the judge ordered that testimony stricken from the court record , but jurors clearly heard it			0
prosecutors argue that @entity3 , who was @entity11 's personal physician as he prepared for planned comeback concerts , is criminally responsible for the singer 's death because of medical negligence and his reckless use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to help @entity11 sleep			1
the coroner ruled that @entity11 's death on june 25 , 2009 , was the result of " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with sedatives			1
@entity3 's defense lawyers contend @entity11 caused his own death by swallowing eight lorazepam pills and orally ingesting propofol while @entity3 was out of the room			1
@entity89 , a cocktail waitress who met @entity3 when she was working at a @entity14 steakhouse , testified tuesday that @entity3 called her at 11:51 a.m. that day			2
@entity89 said she did all the talking for five or six minutes " telling him about my day " but that she realized he had stopped responding to her			2
that moment , about 11:57 a.m. , is when prosecutors contend @entity3 first realized that @entity11 had stopped breathing			1
" i said ' hello , hello , are you there ? " @entity89 testified			0
she said when she pressed her cell phone against her ear , " i heard the mumbling of voices ... and i heard coughing , and nobody answered			0
" @entity89 hung up the phone about three minutes later , she said			0
@entity3 , who is married , lived with @entity104 , 29 , at the time he was working as @entity11 's personal physician in the 2009			1
@entity3 took @entity106 and their newborn son to visit with @entity11 at his home in march 2009 , she testified			2
" i was speechless when i met him , " @entity106 said about the first of several visits with the pop icon			0
" i could n't believe i was meeting @entity11			2
" @entity3 called her from the ambulance while on the way to the hospital with @entity11 , @entity106 testified			2
" i remember him telling me , that he was on the way to the hospital in the ambulance with mr. @entity11 and for me not to be alarmed , " @entity106 said			0
" he did n't want me to be worry , because he knew i would learn this through the news			0
" pharmacist @entity125 , who followed @entity106 on the witness stand tuesday , testified he sold and shipped more than four gallons of propofol to the @entity131 apartment where @entity3 lived with @entity106			2
@entity132 and @entity133 were the only @entity11 siblings in court tuesday			0
@entity136 left the country last weekend to attend a @entity139 premiere in @entity140 , @entity141 , and she is not expected to return until after this weekend 's " @entity145 " tribute in @entity143 , @entity144			0
the judge ordered lawyers not to disclose to reporters ahead of time who they will call as witnesses , but they 've been closely following the order used in the preliminary hearing			0
@entity156 homicide detective @entity155 , who led the @entity156 investigation of @entity11 's death , and coroner 's investigator @entity159 will probably testify tuesday or wednesday , based on that pattern			1
on monday , the emergency room doctor who declared @entity11 dead testified that there was no way doctors could have revived the pop icon after he arrived at the hospital			0
dr. @entity169 said @entity3 never told her that he had given @entity11 propofol before he stopped breathing , but it would not have made a difference if he had because @entity11 " had died long before			1
" " it is unlikely with that information that i would have been able to do something different that would have changed the outcome , " @entity173 said			0
prosecutors argue that @entity3 's failure to tell paramedics and doctors trying to resuscitate @entity11 about the propofol is one of the negligent acts that make him criminally responsible for @entity11 's death			1
another doctor testified monday that the decision to place an aortic balloon pump in @entity11 's heart was " a desperate attempt , even though very much futile " intended " to prepare dr. @entity3 mentally to accept the fact that mr. @entity11 could not be rescued and would allow mr. @entity11 to depart in peace and dignity			1
" dr. @entity194 said @entity3 asked that " we not to give up easily and try to save mr. @entity11 's life , " @entity194 said , even though it seemed hopeless			1
they placed a balloon pump in @entity11 's aorta in an unsuccessful effort to restart his heart , she said			2
" it 's not a case of too little , too late , but a case of too late , " @entity194 said			0
@entity173 had recommended at 12:57 p.m. , when @entity11 was still at his home , that paramedics stop resuscitation efforts and declare him dead			0
@entity11 was the first patient she had ever treated in the emergency room after having made such a recommendation to paramedics in the field , she said			0
" i have never given a time of death in the field and then have that patient brought to me , " she said			0
she said this exception was not because @entity11 was a celebrity , but because the patient had a physician with him who did not want them to give up			0
prosecutors have criticized @entity3 , who is a cardiologist , for using propofol on @entity11 , contending it should be used only by anesthesiologists who have proper monitoring equipment			1
@entity173 , a prosecution witness , acknowledged under questioning by defense lawyer @entity228 that she uses it regularly as an emergency room doctor			0
if convicted of involuntary manslaughter , @entity3 could spend four years in a @entity234 prison and lose his medical license .			0
