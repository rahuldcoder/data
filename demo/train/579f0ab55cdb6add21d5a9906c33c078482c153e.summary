-- like a stereotypical beauty pageant , it looks like thin will be in at the world 's largest annual gadget convention next week in @entity5			1
at the 2012 @entity7 , computer makers will be pushing a new breed of ultra-thin , ultra-light laptops amid a sea of razor - thin smartphones and tablets			1
last year , 140,000 people in the technology industry convened at the @entity15 to mingle and gawk at cutting - edge hardware			2
the organizers expect to welcome at least that many people next week			0
electronics makers use @entity7 as a platform to show the types of products they plan to release in the coming year			1
the compact disc player , high - definition television and @entity26 each debuted at past conventions			0
decades since its formation , the yearly six - day event is a spectacle			0
but with some of the largest players in today 's consumer electronics industry shunning @entity7 , the trade show 's impact may be waning			1
@entity35 , the world 's most valuable technology company , and @entity38 , an upstart in tablets and the leader in e-readers , do not participate			2
@entity43 's operating systems can be found in partners ' booths , running on phones , tablets and @entity47 , but the software giant does not run a booth			1
and @entity50 , which will deliver its 14th @entity7 presentation monday , announced recently it will not have a booth or participate in the keynotes after this year 's event			1
" are we doing something because it 's the right thing to do , or because ' it 's the way we 've always done it ? ' " a @entity50 spokesman asked rhetorically in a statement			1
the big product categories that will dominate the @entity7 show floor next week , according to manufacturers and analysts , are not revolutionary			2
they are expected to be thinner , lighter and more refined versions of gadgets that have already gained a toehold with consumers			1
tablets electronics makers have been chasing after @entity35 's @entity71 for two years , and the racetrack is expected to get more crowded next week			1
@entity43 and @entity73 last month released the first phone running @entity75 4.0 , which is @entity43 's first system that 's designed to work consistently on either a phone or a tablet			1
at @entity7 , tech companies will showcase plenty of phones with that software , but the touchscreen tablets with @entity75 will be prevalent			1
not to get left out of the party it started about a decade ago , @entity50 is stepping up its tablet efforts			2
the next major version of @entity88 will have a revamped interface for tablet computers , which will present programs as tiles that can be touched to fill the screen			0
analysts expect to see a bevy of @entity97 tablets at @entity7			1
with so many options , bargain hunters may get to pick something besides @entity38 's @entity101 , which lit up holiday sales last month			2
( @entity103 actually has quite a bit of @entity75 code under the hood			2
) @entity107 @entity88 wo n't be just for tablets , of course			1
a new breed of computers called @entity107 will launch at @entity7 from several pc manufacturers			1
if the tablet wars are a response to the @entity71 , then @entity107 follow in the footsteps of @entity35 's @entity115			1
they are thinner and lighter than the average laptop because they typically do not have disc drives , and instead of hard drives , use flash memory , which is faster but more expensive			2
@entity50 will enable this anti-disc computer with the application store in @entity97			1
but the @entity107 initiative is being driven by @entity125 , which makes the processor that runs them			2
" you have @entity125 pushing heavily on this very thin but relatively traditional clamshell form factor without a lot of emphasis on touch , " @entity129 analyst @entity128 said in a phone interview			0
" and then you 've got @entity50 pushing the touchscreen tablet experience			2
" netbooks appear to be on their way out			0
that 's a bad sign for @entity43 , whose @entity140 have struggled to challenge @entity50 in @entity143 operating systems			1
internet tvs that also do @entity145 tvs have long been the centerpiece of @entity7 and of the consumer electronics industry as a whole			1
for the last few years , the big push has been in three - dimensional viewing technology , but demand has been small			0
meanwhile , internet services are also working their way onto television sets			0
@entity155 and @entity156 have seen tremendous growth on tv platforms			0
for the @entity145 optimists , app - friendly tvs , which also happen to work with @entity145 glasses , could allow for more 3 - d video from independent filmmakers who distribute over the @entity164 , @entity128 noted			0
@entity7 is expected to provide a launchpad for tvs that are smarter about how they let watchers access web content , analysts say			1
@entity43 has reportedly invested more in its tv platform , which should be evident at @entity7			1
the electronics giants do not want to get beaten to another big opportunity by @entity35 , which is rumored to be working on a tv set of its own			0
do n't expect @entity35 to show up at @entity7 with a big screen though			2
or to show up at all			0
connected cars as the automotive industry strives for a rebound , car makers are looking for high tech to be their guide			0
several car companies have lined up @entity7 presentations			2
they are expected to announce partnerships with popular @entity187 software companies and unveil technical wonders available at the touch of a button on the steering wheel			0
@entity192 , the head of @entity194 , will present a keynote speech tuesday			0
@entity196 , the music - streaming service , plans to announce integration with a line of cars tuesday			0
and since last @entity7 , @entity156 has more than doubled the number of cars that tap into its streaming radio service , @entity156 founder @entity201 said in a phone interview			2
" these companies see the car as a software platform , " @entity201 said			0
" it 's the computer on four wheels			0
" apps sure , @entity7 is about gadgets , but the programs that run on them have become a key selling point			1
many electronics makers have apparently decided that each new phone , tablet , car or refrigerator should allow owners to update their @entity223 statuses			0
" software has simply become so critical to the overall customer experience , " said @entity128 , the @entity129 analyst			0
" it 's no longer an optional part of the business			0
" software makers are eager to exploit this reality			0
many say they will tout their wares at partners ' booths and in private meetings			0
for example , online video provider @entity237 plans to make a major announcement monday to coincide with the start of @entity7			1
@entity237 ceo @entity242 said in an interview at the company 's @entity245 headquarters that @entity7 has emerged as an important venue for her company and others like it			1
" it 's the only trade show i attend all year , " she said .			0

the @entity7 brings a slew of new gadgets
tablets running @entity43 's @entity75 and @entity50 's @entity97 will debut
@entity107 , a new type of thinner laptop , are expected to make a *splash*
but some of the largest players in the consumer electronics industry are shunning @entity7
