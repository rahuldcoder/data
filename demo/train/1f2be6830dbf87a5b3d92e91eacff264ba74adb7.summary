" @entity14 said he and @entity33 both took cover and as @entity4 walked around one side of the building , he went around the other			1
" that 's when i saw him again			2
i told him to drop his weapon and he fired a couple more rounds			2
he fell , i went up and secured his weapon			2
" as soon as his weapon had been taken away , medics appeared , @entity14 said			2
" it was like instantaneous , " he said			2
" we started life - saving measures to keep him alive as well			1
" specialist @entity45 , a medic , was among those who treated the wounded , including @entity33 , shot in both thighs and a wrist , and the suspect			1
" when the first gunshots started , you know , it was complete chaos , " he told @entity2 's " @entity54			2
" " just everyone outside the building started scattering			2
they just all ran behind anything that would stop a bullet -- cars , trash cans , trees , anything			2
" @entity64 said he came upon @entity33 , who was already being helped by others			2
" i made a tourniquet , put it around her thigh and put it down until the bleeding stopped , but she 'd already lost a lot of blood , " he said			2

" he then turned his attention to @entity4 , asking him where he had been shot			1
" i could n't get him to answer , " de @entity45 said			0
" he looked really calm , really pale			0
" @entity77 reservist sgt. @entity76 also stepped in to help the wounded , but first she and some co-workers took refuge in a bathroom			1
@entity76 told @entity2 's " @entity84 " that she was taking her lunch break when she overheard fellow soldiers saying they heard shooting			1
at first , that did n't alarm her			0
" this is @entity0 , shooting goes on , " she said			1
but when a major told her to call 911 , she tried to do so , but could n't get through , she said			0
soon , it became apparent that the threat was real			0
" i was walking down the hall and wondering what i would tell 911 and then a lot of my coworkers come in and they said , ' just get in the bathroom			0
' " they took refuge there for about a minute , " but it felt like it took forever , " she said			0
" it was so quiet , but then we heard just loud screams and stomps , a lot of chaos going on			0
" unwilling to stay cooped up in the tiny room as an unknown danger lurked outside , they opened the door and ran out , she said			0
ahead of them she saw the building exit and the conference center where the shooting was taking place			1
then , her cell phone rang -- it was one of her captains calling to talk about administrative matters			0
" i just said , ' shut up , i need to talk to you			0
' he called 911 , " she said			0
by now , she had figured out what to say			0
" i said , ' we 're coming under attack			0
there 's somebody shooting at the @entity129 , " she said , using soldier shorthand for " soldier readiness program			1
" " as i 'm talking to him , i 'm seeing a soldier who 's wounded and there 's two soldiers holding his leg up , a medic and others helping , " she said			1
share thoughts on @entity0 shooting , memories of victims the soldier they were working on appeared in shock , his lips a pasty white , so @entity146 said she tried to calm him down			1
