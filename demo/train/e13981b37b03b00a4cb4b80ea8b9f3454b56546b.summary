-- i write this piece with some trepidation , because people are understandably troubled by the crash of @entity6 and want to know why it happened			1
they do not want to hear that it " could have been worse , " that such events are extremely rare or that the causes of the accident are n't clear			2
but i will focus below on all of these points , because they are true and worth noting			0
it is tragic that two teenage girls perished in the @entity18 crash			0
but given the conflagration that left the plane a charred hulk , it is remarkable that 99 % of the passengers survived the accident			0
moreover , these were the first two deaths on scheduled commercial flights in the @entity27 this year or , for that matter , in the last 4Â½ years			1
during that period , more 3 billion passengers flew with no fatalities in the @entity27 or on @entity27 airlines			1
two in 3 billion is a very small number			0
did @entity18 pilot have enough 777 experience ? how small ? at that risk per flight , a traveler could on average fly once a day for 4 million years before succumbing to a fatal crash			1
an @entity27 youth at an airport is far more likely to grow up to be president than to perish on today 's flight			1
( that youth is also more likely to win the @entity45 in physics			1
) @entity27 flying has become so safe that fear of an air journey is almost as farfetched as fear of a ceiling collapse at the grocery store			2
that circumstance is a remarkable tribute to the efforts of airlines , aircraft manufacturers , governments , the media and a flying public that holds aviation to the highest standards of safety			0
yet we should not tolerate even two deaths if they can plausibly be avoided			0
for that reason , we need to study carefully what went wrong on @entity6 to minimize the risk of recurrence			2
we should resist the temptation to characterize what happened as pilot error , which can lead to the fatalistic view that " to err is human " and that these things are bound to happen			0
even if the pilots did err in some way , the germane question is why			0
it appears @entity6 's problem was that it was flying so slowly it eventually stalled and collapsed to the ground			2
shock and survival : crash through the eyes of children but why were the pilots unaware of the slow speed ? were some of the instrument readings faulty ? might some of the readings have been hard to interpret ( like the confusing readings about the rate of descent that caused a jet to crash in 1992 into a mountain ) ? the pilots did get a warning about an impending stall about seven seconds before the plane hit the sea wall			1
but why was there only a seven - second warning ? could systems be reconfigured so that warnings about potential stalls are issued sooner ? to be sure , earlier warnings might yield a proliferation of false alarms , but might that price be worth paying so that true alarms arrive in time to be useful ? had @entity6 been warned seven seconds earlier , we might never have heard about it			1
under the circumstances , it is heartening that the @entity117 will painstakingly study everything that happened on @entity6 , and will identify indirect as well as direct causes of the crash			1
that is the best reason to hope that what happened at @entity124 will never occur again within our lifetimes			0
and given all the progress to date in aviation safety , that hope is anything but forlorn			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity132 .			2

@entity132 : commercial flight fatalities rare , and most survived @entity6 crash
he says a @entity27 youth more likely to be president or win @entity45 in physics than die in crash
he says we must focus on *mechanical* reasons for crash
@entity132 : seven - second warning of stall should have come sooner
