-- @entity1 is one fabulous and fun sage			0
the girl had it goin ' on way back in 1984 when she sang " @entity6			0
oh , i hear you			0
fresh off her " we were dead broke " when we left the @entity15 gaffe , @entity12 told the @entity17 newspaper @entity16 that people in the middle class " do n't see me as part of the problem			1
" why ? because , she says , when it comes to income inequality , " we [ @entity22 ] pay ordinary income tax , unlike a lot of people who are truly well off ... and we 've done it through dint of hard work			1
" the @entity32 do come from humble backgrounds and they did work hard back to get to where they are , but @entity37 's hard work today is in the eye of the beholder			1
writing a speech then delivering it for $ 200,000 takes some brain work , but it 's a lot easier than digging ditches			1
or rushing home after an eight - hour shift at @entity46 to cook dinner , take care of the kids , do the laundry and then do it all again six hours later			0
let 's face it , when you and your beloved are worth $ 100 million , most @entity51 find it difficult to relate to your past " hard work " when you now have the luxury of drivers , maids , @entity61 and a mansion in @entity63 , @entity64			1
the @entity16 reporter observed in his article that laughing appears to be @entity37 's " way of acknowledging pain			1
" perhaps she realized her inelegance on some level , because she let out a burst of laughter after her response			0
as @entity1 said , money changes everything			2
would n't it have been grand if @entity37 had said , " i worked hard , yes , but i 've been blessed for so many years			1
i ca n't say i totally understand your life , but having been there once , i promise you , i 'll try			2
" but , it 's a rare wealthy politician or millionaire who will admit they do n't " get " the middle class or the working poor			1
what other explanation is there for @entity90 's comments during his 2012 presidential run about 47 % of @entity51 ? " all right , there are 47 % who are with [ president @entity94 ] , " @entity90 said , " who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them			1
... these are people who pay no income tax			1
... my job is not to worry about those people			0
i 'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives			0
" @entity110 ( @entity111 ) was so awesomely right when he said in the movie , " trading places , " " the best way you hurt rich people is by turning them into poor people			0
the rock legend is worth a mint , but he , too , came from modest means			2
he so desperately wants his kids to know what it 's like to have a " work ethic " that he expects them to earn their own money			1
in other words , do n't count on a giant inheritance from mom and dad			2
it 's worthy exercise , except you ca n't change entitled people by simply withholding cash			1
@entity137 , an award - winning journalist and author of " @entity140 , " said @entity118 's exercise is " doomed to fail			2
" " when you grow up in a white collar home , kids have absorbed so many lessons of being entitled			0
it 's no one 's fault ; it 's simply how it works , " @entity137 said			2
in other words , @entity118 's kids will never know what it 's like to be " seen and not heard			2
" they 're used to having a place at the table , not working for one			0
@entity154 , director of the @entity155 at the @entity156 , says if the wealthy really want to understand those with more modest means , they should resurrect sen. @entity161 's 100 " workdays			1
" back in 1977 , when @entity161 was running for governor of @entity163 , he told voters he would " experience the lives of ordinary @entity166 firsthand by working their jobs			2
" in order to accomplish that , as @entity161 's website put it , he worked 100 days laboring at everything from " changing bedpans and cleaning invalids in a nursing home to wielding blowtorches as a steel worker and going without sleep as a long - haul trucker			1
" @entity161 told me , " i learned a lot of intangibles			0
i learned by actually doing something as opposed to learning by listening to a lecture or reading it in a book			0
" not only that , @entity161 said , he learned " a lot about what government does that does n't make sense in the real world			0
" wow ! perhaps millionaire politicians should give @entity161 's workdays a try			1
or at least get a grip on their talking points			0
@entity197 did -- yes , our vice president			0
he told a group of people at the @entity202 : " sometimes we talk about this stuff , about struggle			0
my struggle -- my @entity206 , compared to where i grew up and the way people are trying to go through things -- but here is the point i want to make -- i have been really , really fortunate			0
" did our vp just admit that money does change everything ?			1

@entity12 said she pays ordinary income tax and made money through hard work
@entity219 says when the @entity32 are worth $ 100 million , it 's hard for @entity51 to relate
@entity219 : it 's rare for wealthy politicians to admit they are n't in touch with middle class
@entity228 politicians need to *concede* that " money changes everything , " @entity219 says
