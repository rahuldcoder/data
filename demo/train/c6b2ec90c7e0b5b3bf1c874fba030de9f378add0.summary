-- it 's weird out there and getting weirder : a @entity4 court just ruled that screwing around with your phone 's map app while driving ought to be as illegal as texting or using the device without a handsfree solution			1
i 'll get back to that in a moment , but let 's talk briefly about the stuff we do while driving			1
some years ago i bought my first car - based gps , an entry - level @entity18 you clipped into one of these windshield holders that attach by plastic cup and a lever you clamp down to really crank the suction			2
for years , both here in the @entity26 and another two living in the @entity27 , i used the thing to go everywhere			0
and , i suspect like most people , i 'd often fiddle with it while driving , whether adding new routes or destinations , checking sub-screens for additional info , or just tapping to mute it altogether			2
there 's no question that 's a distraction , you know , if we define that word as something " that prevents someone from giving full attention to something else " ( thanks @entity46 )			2
then again , by that definition , eating in the car counts as a distraction			0
so does fiddling with the climate control or audio systems , changing cds , glancing at a piece of paper with a handwritten address or scanning printed route directions			0
you can make the argument that even stuff along the road , say splashy billboards with clever ( or not - so - clever ) advertising and political rhetoric are distracting ( rubberneck much ? )			2
really , most things we do in life count as distractions			1
sitting here typing this , the music that 's playing in the background is a distraction ( listening to @entity75 's new album , move , keeps drawing my attention away from writing )			2
the rain splashing the window on what 's turning out to be a pretty gloomy monday is a distraction			2
the cup of coffee i keep reaching for ( and having to refill ) is definitely a distraction			0
( thus , my excuse for taking too long to type this up : music , rain and coffee			0
) no , i 'm not hurtling down the road in a 2 - ton metal hulk on a highway where i 'm separated from equally speedy oncoming vehicles by just a few feet			2
then again , i often listen to music , most surely have to deal with rain and drink plenty of coffee , all while managing to obey the rules of the road — and , i 'd argue anyway , drive defensively			0
the only serious accident i 've had in my life did n't involve a distraction at all , but a patch of unexpected black ice and a sudden crosswind that sent me fishtailing at 70 m.p.h			0
off the interstate into an @entity107 ditch filled , thankfully , with two feet of snow			0
so i 'm a little concerned to see ( via @entity109 ) that a @entity4 judge just ruled using a mobile phone to fiddle with a mapping / gps program qualifies as distracted driving ( thus rendering it illegal per state law )			1
the case involved a driver who 'd been cited for " driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone			1
" the driver claimed to be using the phone for mapping purposes and argued that the state 's distracted driving laws should n't have applied ( he says he was looking at a map on the phone while holding it in his hand )			1
the court , while admitting the state 's underlying distracted driving strictures themselves might be too broad , ultimately disagreed with the driver , finding that the law clearly forbids using a wireless phone while driving " unless the device is being used in a hands - free manner			1
" so much for maps , apps — you name it			1
simply holding the phone in your hands , for all intents and purposes , is pretty much a @entity4 no - no. that @entity18 i mentioned above ? long gone			1
i yanked it shortly after picking up my first iphone in early 2011			0
most trips , where i know what i 'm doing beforehand , i 'll set it up before i pull out of my garage			0
but occasionally i 'll reprogram it on the go , when i need to add a destination or change some detail			0
and yet @entity156 's own distracted driving laws stipulate the following : " @entity160 , typing , or sending text message on wireless 2 - way communication device prohibited ; use of hand - held mobile telephone prohibited ; applicability of subsections ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ; exceptions ; violation as civil infraction ; fine ; local ordinances superseded			1
" i 'm pretty sure typing an address into my phone 's navigation app while driving counts as " texting			1
" should it ? i suppose it probably should			0
what 's the difference between typing an address into a gps / mapping app and typing / reading sms messages , really ? the latter activity might continue longer if you 're engaged in a conversation , but they 're both the same from a motor - skills standpoint , are n't they ? what about holding the phone in one hand just to look at your smartphone 's map ( say you lack a phone - mounting apparatus ) as this person claimed to be doing ? should just looking at your phone while driving be illegal ? should cars come with smartphone - mounting kits ? where ought they be installed ? above the dash only ? and — here 's where it gets really quirky — what 's the difference , really , between glancing down at a phone you 're holding in one hand , and glancing down at one of these gps / mapping lcd screens that come built - into so many vehicle dashboards these days ? could some of these issues be remedied through better driver training ? do we need os - level standards in our mobile computing devices that help govern how we use them in moving vehicles ( specifically while driving ) ? i 'm not sure what the answer ought to be , but state legislatures need to tread very carefully and , to the extent this stuff does warrant legislation , propose laws rooted firmly in the actual research , not some legislator 's unstudied opinions ( like this amendment recently introduced by @entity230 to ban a product that 's not even available yet )			1

a @entity4 judge ruled it 's illegal to use apps like @entity240 while driving
writer : how are map apps different than many other distractions ?
driver had argued maps do n't count under texting - while - driving laws
legislatures will have to consider the details when making laws
