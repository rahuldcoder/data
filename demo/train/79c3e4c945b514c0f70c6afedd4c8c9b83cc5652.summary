-- an @entity3 man missing for 18 years after his mother abducted him and her two other children to @entity6 was reunited with his father after the son went to a @entity10 consulate and declared he wanted to go home at age 23 , authorities said			1
@entity14 's mother , @entity13 , lost custody of her three children following a divorce from husband @entity18 , and then she and the small children disappeared in october 1995 , said lt. @entity20 of the @entity21			1
@entity14 and his father were n't available for comment and asked for privacy as the son now stays in his father 's home in @entity28 , about a 25 - mile drive east of downtown @entity30 , @entity20 said			1
but @entity20 was present for the reunion because he escorted the father , along with his sister , to meet his son at the @entity30 airport last wednesday			1
" they were nervous , " @entity20 said of the father and son			2
" the dad asked me on the way there , ' who do i do ? do i shake his hand or give him a hug ? ' " i said , ' you will know when you see him			0
' " @entity14 immediately recognized us at the airport			2
he walked up and initiated a hug to his father , " @entity20 said			0
" you could tell there was a lot of emotion , " @entity20 said , but the men did n't become tearful			2
@entity14 also hugged his aunt , @entity20 said			2
the exact whereabouts of the mother , still facing an @entity3 warrant , as well as the two other children , have n't been disclosed by the long - lost son , other than to say they 're alive and well in @entity6 , @entity20 said			1
the last time the father saw his son , the boy was 5 years old			1
since then , the father worked as a paramedic in @entity30 and is now a deputy coroner for @entity72 , working in the same building as the sheriff 's office , @entity20 said			0
" i 've been involved in law enforcement for 17 years , and this is by far the most unusual and most rewarding thing i 've been involved with , " @entity20 said wednesday			0
" unfortunately there are a lot less happy endings than there are good endings			0
sometimes the kids are never heard of again			0
or when they do , so much time has passed , they do n't want any relationship , especially if they were young enough that they did n't have memories of their parent			0
" at the time they were whisked away by their mother , @entity14 's sister , @entity92 , was 3 years old and his brother , @entity96 , was 7 years old , authorities said			1
their mother , @entity97 , now 46 , still faces a state warrant carrying a charge of violating a custody order , a @entity103 felony , which is the least serious in @entity3 , @entity20 said			1
at one time , she also faced a federal warrant for unlawful flight , but that was dropped in 2005 or 2006 because of cooperation issues with the @entity6 government , @entity20 said			2
" his mother and brother and sister were touchy subjects , and we did n't talk a lot about them , " @entity20 said of his conversations with @entity14			1
" i think if he tells too much information , it 's going to affect their lives			0
they 're happy , healthy and alive			0
he told his siblings they 're free to come back if they choose to do so			0
" @entity20 speculates that the missing mother and three children had probably been hiding in @entity6 's larger cities			1
" i would assume they would probably be living close to @entity129 or a large city			0
it 's easier to blend in , " @entity20 said			0
" i think he was all over the place in @entity6			2
" @entity14 has apparently been using @entity134 regularly in @entity6 because " he speaks very good @entity134 as well as very good @entity136 , " @entity20 said			1
his @entity137 does n't even have an accent , @entity20 said			0
" it 's just a pretty neutral @entity137 accent , " he said			0
most recently , @entity14 was living on his own in @entity6 , and on january 27 , he went to the @entity10 consulate in @entity143 and showed his social security card and @entity10 birth certificate			1
he also showed surgical scars that matched his records , @entity20 said			0
@entity14 wanted to return to the @entity10 " to meet his father and start a new chapter of life , " @entity20 said			1
on january 28 , @entity14 flew to @entity152 , @entity153 , where he met with officials of the @entity155 , who along with @entity3 authorities have been searching for him , his mother and siblings			1
the next day , @entity14 arrived in @entity30 to see his father for the first time in almost two decades			2
@entity161 now wants to attend school in the @entity10 and enter the medical field as a cardiologist , physical therapist or nurse , @entity20 said			1
" i told him the fact that he was bilingual , it 's going to help him out a lot , " @entity20 said			0
while on the run from the law , the mother apparently told her children they were free to return to the @entity10 if they so chose , @entity20 said			1
