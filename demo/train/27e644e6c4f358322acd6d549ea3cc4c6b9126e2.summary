-- even with just 10 tracks and no session details , this companion to @entity3 's 2011 documentary deserves a brass -- band welcome			1
six outtakes come from the presumptuous stages of @entity11 's 1970 triumph , " @entity12 , " including a sweet -- @entity14 reading of " @entity15 , " " @entity16 " as acoustic hosanna and a demo of the title song that betrays its roots in the band 's frontier hymnal			1
the @entity24 and @entity25 covers have more sheen but also the intimate grace of the quiet @entity29 's seventies solo prime			2
this set 's subtitle suggests there are more rarities to come ; based on the quality here , i propose a full -- blown anthology			0
