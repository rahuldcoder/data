the @entity1 @entity0 on monday began three days of potentially landmark oral arguments over the constitutionality of the sweeping health care law championed by president @entity5 , with a majority of justices appearing to reject suggestions they wait another few years before deciding the issues			1
in one of the most politically charged cases in years , the health care reform case drew people who waited in line starting friday for the chance to attend , and sparked competing news conferences by supporters and opponents of the 2010 law passed by @entity21 over united @entity23 opposition			1
hear oral arguments before the high court in the landmark case the public sessions started monday with 90 minutes of lively debate on a legally dense , but nonetheless important , question			1
it boils down to whether the health care law 's key provision is a " tax " that could prevent the court from considering the broader constitutional questions			1
the key provision involved is the " individual mandate " requiring most americans to purchase some form of health insurance or face a substantial tax penalty			1
an obscure federal law known as the @entity43 , which dates back to 1867 , bars claimants from asking for a refund on a tax until that tax has been paid			1
this " gateway " issue could stop the current legal fight in its tracks if the justices think the minimum coverage requirement amounts to a tax			1
several of them seemed reluctant monday to take that route			0
read a transcript of the arguments justice @entity59 said the lawsuit being considered was about the constitutionality of a provision requiring the purchase of insurance , rather than a tax penalty			1
" this is a suit that is challenging the ' must - buy ' provision , and the argument is made that , if , indeed , ' must - buy ' is constitutional , then these complainants will not resist the penalty , " she said			0
" so what they 're seeking is a determination that ... ' must - buy ' is unconstitutional , and , if that 's so , that 's the end of the case			2
if it 's not so , they are not resisting the penalty			0
" justice @entity81 , a conservative , seemed to agree , dismissing suggestions that a " parade of horribles " would happen if the court decided the larger constitutional questions now			0
however , justice @entity87 and chief justice @entity88 suggested a tax was indeed involved			0
" the idea that the mandate is something separate from whether you want to call it a penalty or tax just does n't seem to make much sense			0
a mandate is a command , " @entity88 said , later adding : " it seems very artificial to separate the punishment from the crime			0
... why would you have a requirement that is completely toothless ? " in an unusual twist , the @entity5 administration is now siding with the law 's opponents and strongly argued the mandate is not a tax			2
the high court actually designated a @entity114 private attorney , @entity113 , to argue in favor of the tax question			0
four mostly liberal members of the court -- including @entity5 appointees @entity119 and @entity121 -- were aggressive in saying there was no tax at play here			0
" @entity125 has nowhere used the word ' tax '			2
what it says is ' penalty ' , " noted justice @entity128			0
" moreover , this is not in the @entity133 but for purposes of collection			0
and so why is this a tax ? i know you point to certain sentences that talk about taxes within the @entity133			0
this is not a tax to a tax			0
this is a tax to a health care requirement			1
" citing the @entity43 might give the court , particularly conservative members , a way out of deciding the explosive issue in an election year			2
the majority might conclude the political branches can best resolve the conflicts , at least for now , or that the matter can be handled after the november elections			0
some court watchers have called this the health care " sleeper issue " that could potentially delay a decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate for at least four years			1
monday 's case was @entity165 v. @entity166 ( 11 - 398 )			0
the larger , separate question of the individual mandate 's constitutionality will be argued at the high court tuesday			2
the justices as a group seemed anxious monday to move beyond the narrow issue of jurisdiction and address the larger constitutional questions			2
by the end of monday 's arguments , justices already were posing hypotheticals on other aspects of the law , including the individual mandate and state requirements to expand the @entity184 program -- questions to be tackled in the next two days			2
four big issues : breaking down what the justices will tackle outside the court building monday , supporters and opponents argued their own views			0
" everything this administration has done has moved us in the wrong direction , has created such a high level of uncertainty , reduced the confidence of the @entity1 people , " said @entity193 sen. @entity193 of @entity194			0
" the @entity0 has to do the right thing and rule this thing unconstitutional			1
" @entity21 rep. @entity205 of @entity206 said the high court should let voters decide through elections , instead of imposing a decision by nine justices			1
" this court has a long tradition of deferring to the judgment of the voters , and that 's what i think they will and should do here , " @entity205 said , adding that the health care law will " help a lot of people and help our country and that will be a great thing for our future			1
" a new @entity227 / @entity226 poll monday reflected the public divide over health care reform			1
the survey , conducted over the weekend , shows that the 2010 health care law is increasing in popularity , especially among independent voters , but half of @entity1 still oppose it			1
according to the poll , 43 % of @entity1 approve of the law , up five points from last november , with 50 % saying they disapprove , a drop of 6 points			1
of those who oppose the measure , 37 % said it was too liberal and 10 % said it was n't liberal enough			0
on the most controversial provision of the law -- a mandate requiring people to have health care coverage -- 51 % of those questioned said they opposed it and 47 % favored it , a gap within the survey 's margin of error			1
according to the @entity0 , 110 members of the public -- almost double the initial estimate -- were admitted to watch monday 's arguments , along with 117 credentialed members of the media			1
the justices know their eventual rulings could establish profound guidelines on the extent of congressional power and could shake up a presidential election year where health care has become a hot campaign topic			1
" the social and political stakes just in this case in particular are quite significant , but even beyond that , there are broader constitutional principles , " said @entity272 , who will argue against the law before the justices			2
" this is a legal question and it 's got a lot of people excited politically			0
" " the @entity286 moves us very close to achieving health coverage for everyone , " said @entity284 , executive director of @entity285 , a health advocacy group			2
" it 's my hope that the justices protect the law and allow the law to go into effect			2
" health reform opponent : ' @entity125 made a bad situation worse ' health reform supporter : ' it really is going to help the public ' seats inside the court were scarce , both for interested parties and the public			1
because of demand , the court 's clerk told representatives from @entity125 , the @entity5 administration , the states and the dozens of private advocacy groups to decide among themselves who will attend			2
for example , 26 states are leading the legal challenge before the @entity0 , but there will only be room for six attorneys general to attend the arguments			1
legal sources said those negotiations over the choices turned testy when some officials were not picked			0
@entity325 court rulings during election years sen. @entity327 , @entity328 ; sen. @entity329 , @entity330 ; and @entity1 rep. @entity331 , @entity332 , said they secured precious seats			0
attorney general @entity334 led the administration contingent			0
and although it is little known , the justices themselves are allowed to give out up to nine tickets to anyone they want , so having an " in " with the bench might be the only way some interested parties will be admitted			0
the @entity0 : how it actually works dueling rallies and protests outside the court added to the charged atmosphere of a major legal case being heard in an election year			1
all the @entity23 presidential candidates have said they would try to repeal the health care law if elected			1
one of them , @entity353 , did not attend the arguments , but he spoke on the courthouse steps afterward to challenge frontrunning rival @entity357 's support for health care reform in @entity359			1
" there is only one candidate who has a chance of winning the @entity23 nomination who can make this the central issue that will be a winning issue for us to win the presidency back , and that is @entity353 , " said the former @entity361 senator			1
" and unfortunately the worst person to make that case is @entity357 and that 's why , as i say , we are here today and he is not			0
" two families , two views on health care reform in the three days of arguments , six lawyers will make their case in what are expected to be free - wheeling question - and - answer sessions characteristic of oral arguments			1
the main attorneys will be @entity272 on one side , representing the 26 - state coalition opposing the law , and solicitor general @entity389 on the other , defending the law			2
the public will be able to listen to the oral arguments on the court 's website shortly after the sessions end			2
in line to secure a rare and precious thing in @entity114 frequently asked questions : a @entity227 guide to the arguments the cases are @entity165 v. @entity166 ( 11 - 398 ) ; @entity401 ( 11 - 393 ) ; and @entity166 v. @entity165 of @entity402 ( 11 - 400 )			0
rulings are expected in june .			0

new poll shows the public is divided on the health care issue
" rule this thing unconstitutional , " says a @entity23 opponent of the law
the @entity0 should let voters decide , says a @entity21 supporter
the @entity0 is poised to offer the final word on the constitutionality of health reform
