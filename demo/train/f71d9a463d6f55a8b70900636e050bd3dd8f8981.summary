-- for more than a year , rights groups have criticized @entity2 for its crackdown on anti-government protests			1
the protests , which began in february 2011 , were spurred by the popular uprisings in @entity6 and @entity7 but have failed to gain the traction of the other @entity10 uprisings			1
@entity11 , a journalist and activist , shares her thoughts on what is happening in her home country and its future in this conversation , edited for length and clarity			2
@entity0 : what do you think about what happened to @entity23 , the 11 - year - old boy who was arrested in may for participating in an " illegal gathering " and released months later from jail ? @entity11 : i think what happened to @entity23 is very tragic			2
keeping a minor behind bars for a month is unexplainable			0
no judiciary system in the world keeps infants jailed for this long without a trial			2
... i think that children are being detained frequently now in order to silence protesters			2
the regime wants to warn protesters that it can do whatever it wants to anyone regardless of his / her age or type of activity the person performs at the time of arrest			2
... @entity23 is not the first minor nor the last			0
there are still others in jail			0
@entity0 : how is this story illustrative of what is happening in @entity2 ? where do you see the situation in @entity2 going ? @entity11 : the situation in @entity2 is unpredictable and chaotic just like all the arbitrary arrests and fabricated charges			1
the judiciary system is not independent			0
the charges are a reflection of what the regime wants to take place on the ground			0
the charges are politically biased , and in most cases , no solid evidence is present			0
... the situation is becoming more and more complicated especially now that activists and human rights defenders who were not arrested earlier are targeted now by the regime			0
an example is @entity76 , who is detained for bogus charges			0
the regime is escalating its revenge from its people amidst the silence of the international community			0
@entity0 : considering the world 's attention on @entity85 and @entity7 as well as other @entity87 nations that have experienced uprisings , do you think that the world has forgotten about @entity2 ? @entity11 : @entity2 is forgotten now , and it was forgotten when the @entity10 started , because what is happening in @entity2 is not the result of the regime 's rule only			1
it is the result of the joint collaboration , interests and political unity of more than one country			0
@entity2 's allies ( @entity100 and the @entity101 ) do not want to interfere in what is taking place because @entity2 has been a good ally for them in the region			1
the @entity108 countries ( which besides @entity2 include @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and the @entity113 ) also can not allow @entity2 to have more democracy and freedom because it will pressure other countries to do the same , and they do not want that			1
so , basically @entity2 has not been forgotten ... but , in fact , it had been deliberately wiped out from the media coverage for political reasons			1
@entity0 : what is next for @entity2 ? what steps can be taken to reach a resolution ? @entity11 : the resolution can not take place unless it comes from the allied countries			1
the international community can place an embargo on @entity2 to force it to become more democratic and undergo reforms			1
@entity2 's economy can not stand on its own			1
it is highly dependent on imports			0
if it is threatened in this way , it can not go on			0
therefore , the international community has to hold its arms sales at least to @entity2 since that is what the regime uses to kill its people			1
a resolution will take place if the allies agree to give the regime in @entity2 the right to undergo reforms .			2
