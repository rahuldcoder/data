-- a federal judge will hear arguments monday on a temporary restraining order against an @entity5 referendum that would ban the use of @entity8 religious law in state courts			1
@entity5 voters approved the amendment during the november elections by a 7 - 3 ratio			0
but the @entity14 challenged the measure as a violation of the @entity17 , and @entity19 district judge @entity18 issued a temporary restraining order november 8 that will keep state election officials from certifying that vote			1
" what this amendment is going to do is officially disfavor and condemn the @entity30 community as being a threat to @entity5 , " @entity23 , executive director of @entity14 's @entity5 chapter and the lead plaintiff in the suit , said earlier this month			2
in addition , he said , the amendment would invalidate private documents , such as wills , that are written in compliance with @entity30 law			0
the amendment would require @entity5 courts to " rely on federal and state law when deciding cases " and " forbids courts from considering or using " either international law or @entity8 religious law , known as @entity46 , which the amendment defined as being based on the @entity48 and the teachings of the @entity50			2
in bringing suit , @entity14 argued that the amendment violates both the establishment and free - exercise clauses of the @entity17 's guarantee of religious freedom			2
@entity23 has said the amendment passed " under a campaign of fearmongering " about @entity8			0
the entire @entity19 @entity30 population is about 2.4 million -- less than 1 percent of the country , according to a 2009 survey by the nonprofit @entity63			0
but supporters said a @entity66 case , in which a judge refused to grant a restraining order against a @entity30 man whose wife accused him of raping her repeatedly , made it necessary for @entity5 to take action to keep @entity8 law from being imposed there			1
the @entity66 decision , in which the family court judge found the husband was abiding by his @entity30 beliefs regarding spousal duties , was overruled by an appellate court			0
but in automated phone messages in support of the amendment , former @entity83 and @entity5 native @entity82 warned that there was a " major campaign in @entity89 to impose @entity46 law " and that @entity8 law " is beginning to be cited in a few @entity19 courts			1

@entity5 voters approve an amendment *barring* the use of @entity8 law in state courts
a @entity19 district judge issued a temporary restraining order on the ban earlier this month
the lead plaintiff says the amendment violates the @entity17
*backers* cite a judge 's refusal to grant a restraining order against a husband accused of rape
