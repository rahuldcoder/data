seven years ago , @entity0 was a 20 per day smoker and weighed a hefty 230 pounds ( 104 kilograms )			1
on sunday , he led the marathon competition against the best in the @entity4 before finishing a creditable 10th place			2
undaunted by the presence of defending champion @entity7 of @entity8 and a host of other athletes with faster personal bests , @entity0 took the opportunity afforded by a tentative start by the race favorites to lead the bunch			1
despite the effort , just a glimmer of a smile can be seen on the face of the 40 - year - old , who was representing @entity22 after a strong showing in the @entity24 in april			1
@entity0 admitted that as the @entity8 and eventual winner @entity25 of @entity26 surged he could not keep pace but his story continues to be an inspiration to all couch potatoes approaching a mid life crisis			1
he crossed the line after 42 kilometers in a personal best of two hours 15 minutes 16 seconds and still with a smile on his face despite toiling on a tough course around @entity37 in rainy conditions			0
" best day ever , " @entity0 said			1
" i normally say it 's second best to my wedding day but this one matches it			2
@entity44 ( his wife ) wo n't mind i think			0
" all my top goals -- top 10 , @entity49 , @entity51 vet record ( for athletes over 40 years of age ) -- and i 've managed all three			1
i could n't have wished for a better day			2
" way finished a minute faster than his performance in @entity56 , where he was third @entity51 finisher behind @entity58 and @entity59 and 15th overall			0
regular training runs , sometimes up to 80km ( 50 miles ) , have seen him trim down to a lean 150 pounds as the fast food takeaways and a heavy alcohol intake have become a thing of the past			0
the marathon is not even @entity0 's specialist distance			2
he will challenge for the world 100km ( 62 miles ) championships in @entity71 , @entity72 in november and with a personal best of six hours 19 minutes 19 seconds , that 's six minute six second miles for the entire distance , has a realistic chance of gold			0
@entity78 was winning the first athletics gold of the @entity80 , improving on his silver from four years ago and with a personal best of two hours 11 minutes 15 seconds			1
behind him , @entity7 faded and his compatriot @entity83 took second with @entity84 of @entity85 in the bronze medal position			0
" it is starting to sink in now , " @entity78 said			0
" i dug deep and i was hoping i would n't blow - up like i have done in the past			0
" later sunday , the competition on the track began at @entity92 , with the final of the men 's 5,000m , despite the absence of the ill @entity97 champion @entity96 , one of the highlights			0
it went to @entity8 @entity100 , the world indoor 3000m champion , in a time of 13 minutes 12.07 seconds to beat teammate @entity102 , with new zealander @entity103 claiming bronze			0
the crowds at the @entity80 will have to wait for the appearance of @entity107 , who has arrived in the @entity109 city , but is not slated to run until next friday 's heats of the 4x100m relay for @entity112			2
home crowds at the swimming pool were able to celebrate their seventh medal of the meeting and it was another fairytale story			1
@entity118 , a diminutive 13 - year - old competitor in the women 's para-sport 100m breaststroke , took a superb bronze behind @entity122 of @entity123			1
@entity118 , who was born with a chronic hip condition , is the youngest member of the @entity109 team , but showed maturity beyond her years to move into the medals after turning sixth .			1

@entity25 wins first athletics gold of @entity80
former 20 - per - day smoker @entity0 , 40 , finishes 10th
@entity0 only took up running seven years ago
@entity118 , 13 , stars in swimming pool
