sunday night 's midseason premiere of " @entity2 " saw the heart - wrenching loss of another fan favorite character , soon after @entity7 died in the previous episode			1
@entity9 ( @entity10 ) , who had tried to maintain some morality in the nightmarish postapocalyptic world , fell victim to a walker bite halfway through the show and struggled to stay alive as @entity16 went for help			1
@entity9 was haunted by visions of his friends @entity7 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , who told him this was how it had to be and all would be ok			2
the governor and @entity28 character @entity26 also showed up in his mind to taunt him , making him lose touch with reality as he was attacked by a second walker , and later as @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity16 cut off his bitten arm			0
it was a sad farewell to yet another character who tried to stand up for what was right , as the now - dead @entity40 and @entity41 had , and one could n't help but be touched by the sight of @entity9 's hat at his gravesite			1
some fans were surprised by the turn of events			0
but the plot twist did n't get approval from everyone			0
after so many deaths lately and the group still determined to push on to @entity53 , one can only wonder who will be next to go .			0
