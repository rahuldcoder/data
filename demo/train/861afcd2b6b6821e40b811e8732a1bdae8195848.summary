-- in documents released friday , prosecutors say the young man accused of gunning down @entity5 moviegoers had earlier threatened someone at the @entity7 and been banned from campus			1
it 's unclear who the threatened person was , but prosecutors have said it was a professor at the @entity7 campus where shooting suspect @entity15 used to take graduate classes			1
the new trove of documents -- 57 in all -- are heavily redacted			2
read the documents here @entity15 , 24 , was barred from the university campus for making threats weeks before the july 20 massacre at a midnight screening of " @entity24			1
" twelve people were killed and 58 injured in the attack			2
@entity15 is facing 152 charges , including murder and attempted murder			2
it 's unclear , because the name of the threatened person has been redacted , whether he or she is the psychiatrist who was treating @entity33 at the university			0
the notion that @entity15 was blocked from campus is incongruous with the university 's statements that he was denied access to non-public portions of the campus because he had withdrawn from classes			1
@entity15 was a @entity43 candidate studying neuroscience at the @entity46 campus in @entity47 , the @entity48 suburb where the shooting took place			1
defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution 's assertions that @entity15 was barred from campus			1
citing statements from the university , the attorneys argue that his access was revoked because that 's normal procedure when a student drops their enrollment			0
the documents also say the defense made a motion to ask the court to sanction prosecutors for making such statements in court			0
the judge declined to punish the prosecution but warned them against " making assertions about the defendant which may be contradicted later by the facts			0
" in an unusual move , the judge will allow the defense team to go against a standing gag order and release a public statement responding to the prosecution 's depiction that @entity15 was blocked from campus			1
a call from @entity15 ? just nine minutes before he burst into a suburban mall movie theater , @entity15 tried to call but failed to reach dr. @entity83 , prosecutors have said			1
last week , a judge ruled that a notebook mailed to @entity86 would not be accessible to prosecutors			0
the court did allow that @entity15 ' lawyers could look at it			2
@entity86 testified that her contact with @entity15 ended june 11			2
she said she later contacted campus police because she was very concerned about her last meeting with him			0
she declined to detail what bothered her			0
in august , public defender @entity97 said in court that @entity15 called a @entity7 switchboard nine minutes before he went into the movie theater in @entity47 , a suburb of @entity48			1
the number can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours , @entity101 said			0
texts from @entity15 ? the documents also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages @entity15 exchanged with someone before the shooting			1
that person was not named , and the content of the texts were not made public			2
police interviewed that person and , with their permission , examined the phone			0
police downloaded the complete contents of the phone because , according to the documents , law enforcement did n't have the technical ability to isolate only the relevant text messages involving @entity15			1
the witness was concerned that contacts and other personal information may be vulnerable , so the defense received a redacted portion of more than 2,000 pages of material from the cell phone			0
in august , court documents claimed that @entity15 " had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people " months before the shooting			1
" the defendant had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people in march 2012 , and that he would do so when his life was over , " said the document released in august			0
no other details were provided about those conversations			0
media requested more information the documents were released because the media has continuously tried to get the court to release more information about movie theater murders			1
a probable - cause affidavit , a document that typically lays out the details of a case , has not been released			0
officials are under a gag order issued by judge @entity155 to protect @entity15 ' rights			2
