@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 will be given access to @entity7 's wives and children , @entity1 interior minister @entity3 told @entity2 on tuesday			1
on monday , a senior @entity1 intelligence source had said the @entity4 could question @entity7 's wives only if their " country of origin has been asked for permission			1
" one of @entity7 's wives is from @entity14			0
a well - placed @entity4 official who would not speak on the record said the other two wives are from @entity18			2
@entity3 , in an interview tuesday with @entity2 , said @entity1 is giving the @entity4 access " so they can interrogate them , they can interview them			1
" @entity3 did not say when or where the @entity4 would have such access			2
@entity28 spokesman col. @entity27 said tuesday @entity4 and @entity1 officials were discussing the matter			1
@entity32 spokesman @entity31 said the administration is optimistic that @entity4 - @entity1 cooperation " will continue with regards to " access to @entity7 's wives " and also to the materials that were collected by the @entity1 after the @entity4 commandos left " the compound where they killed @entity7			1
@entity31 described the @entity4 - @entity1 relationship as " important and complicated			1
" @entity3 , in his interview with @entity2 , said allowing the wives to be interviewed should make clear to the @entity4 that @entity1 has nothing to hide -- and put to rest any suspicions that the world 's most - wanted terrorist might have had a support network inside the @entity1 government , military or intelligence services			1
if @entity1 had " skeletons " to hide , " do you think we would allow access to the wives and the children of @entity7 ? " he asked			1
@entity3 called the decision " proof " that @entity1 is " very clear that we did n't know " @entity7 was living in a compound in @entity0 , a @entity1 city with a major military presence , rather than in mountainous areas which @entity1 and @entity4 officials often said were believed to be @entity7 's hiding place			1
@entity4 president @entity63 told @entity65 ' " @entity64 , " " we think that there had to be some sort of support network for @entity7 inside of @entity1			1
but we do n't know who or what that support network was			0
" @entity3 said there is " not an iota of doubt " in his mind that @entity7 had " no support network from official sources			0
" acknowledging an intelligence failure , he said the investigation that @entity1 prime minister @entity80 has ordered will explore what went wrong , and the answers " will be made public			2
" one @entity4 official said " both sides understand the importance of the relationship , " but expressed concerns over @entity1 's control over all of its political participants			2
" the boat is moving , but there is some chop in the water			0
" the official said that cia director @entity97 and @entity1 's inter-services intelligence chief lt. gen. @entity98 " have always had productive exchanges , even though there have been disagreements			0
" @entity98 's position atop the @entity100 is considered valuable to the @entity4 , the official said , because of his close connection to chief of army staff , gen. @entity103			0
meanwhile , @entity1 officials have said @entity7 's family members will be repatriated to their home countries after their initial interrogations			0
all three wives and eight of his children were taken into @entity1 custody after the may 2 raid by @entity4 commandos that killed @entity7 , the leader of the @entity114 terrorist movement			1
the 29 - year - old @entity14 wife , @entity115 , was wounded during the raid			0
the @entity4 official identified the other two women as @entity118 , also known as " @entity119 , " and @entity120 , or " @entity121			0
" although @entity4 officials have warned of possible reprisal attacks by @entity7 supporters , there has been no surge of attacks inside @entity125 , the commander of @entity124 forces in eastern @entity125 said tuesday			1
" there has been a lot of talk about revenge , about ( insurgents ) coming at both the coalition and the @entity125 forces here , but we have not seen that here since the first of may , " said @entity133 commander maj. gen. @entity132			2
@entity4 and coalition forces were already on guard against an expected @entity145 spring offensive even before @entity7 's death , @entity132 added			2
@entity132 said he hoped that @entity7 's death , and the images of him inside the compound that the @entity4 released , may discourage insurgents			0
but he also cautioned that @entity7 will certainly be replaced with a new @entity114 leader			0
" i do n't think that one person makes the war on terror here , " @entity132 said			0
but he added that he expects insurgents to face some difficulties raising money without @entity7 's " charisma " as part of the effort			0
the commander also noted @entity114 is just one of the insurgent groups that @entity124 and @entity4 forces are fighting in @entity125			1
@entity2 's @entity165 contributed to this report			0
