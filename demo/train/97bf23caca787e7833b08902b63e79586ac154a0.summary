@entity0 -- @entity3 is willing to continue @entity5 - brokered peace talks with the @entity6 but " not at any price , " prime minister @entity2 said on sunday			1
attempts by @entity5 secretary of state @entity9 to put peace talks back on track unraveled in the past week -- @entity3 reneged on a scheduled release of @entity6 prisoners , and the @entity6 responded by signing on to join 15 international bodies , reversing their commitment not to seek international recognition as a state			1
speaking at a weekly @entity18 meeting , @entity2 blamed @entity6 for obstructing negotiations			1
" the @entity6 substantially violated the understandings that were reached with @entity5 involvement , " he said			2
@entity2 said @entity3 would respond with steps of its own if the @entity6 pressed ahead with unilateral actions toward statehood			1
" they will achieve a state only by direct negotiations , not by empty statements and not by unilateral moves , " he said			2
" these will only push a peace agreement farther away , and unilateral steps on their part will be met with unilateral steps on our part			0
we are ready to continue the talks but not at any price			0
" a senior foreign policy adviser for @entity41 , the party of @entity43 president @entity42 , said his party was not surprised by @entity2 's remarks about statehood			0
" if @entity2 considers the @entity6 committing themselves to international law -- including committing themselves to empowering woman and protection of children -- is a provocation that calls for @entity3 punishment , then what the @entity6 are saying all of these years have been proven beyond doubt that @entity3 considers international law to be hindrance for peace , " @entity47 said			1
last july , @entity9 announced a bid to reach a peace deal within nine months			0
