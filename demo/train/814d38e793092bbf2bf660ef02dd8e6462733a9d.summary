take your eyes off the road any longer and your chances of crashing multiply			0
with that in mind , the federal government on tuesday asked automakers to equip cars with devices that require only fleeting glances to operate , instead of prolonged stares			1
under the new voluntary guidelines , drivers should be able to operate on - board electronics while removing their eyes from the road -- or a hand from the wheel -- no longer than two seconds at a time , or 12 seconds total			1
time - consuming functions -- such as text messaging and internet browsing -- should be allowed only when a car is stopped and in park , the @entity21 said			1
drivers should not be allowed to text or browse even at slow speeds because of the danger it presents to pedestrians , the @entity21 said			1
the guidelines , said transportation secretary @entity33 , " balance the innovation consumers want with the safety we all need			1
" some 3,000 people were killed and 387,000 injured in 2011 in accidents involving distracted drivers , he said			0
the new guidelines , which came after months of review , give automakers guidance about a wide range of electronic equipment installed in new automobiles , but considered " secondary " to the job of driving			1
they include communications devices , such as hands - free phones , navigation equipment , such as gps units , entertainment devices , such as @entity58 movie players , and information gathering devices , such as internet - enabled devices			0
the technology advances are crucial selling points , especially for passenger cars , sport utilities , pickups and vans made by @entity68 automakers			1
@entity33 had met previously with car executives to express his overall concerns about distracted driving and to discuss ways to reduce it			1
the guidelines do not apply to hand - held cell phones , the use of which the @entity21 has long discouraged			2
a separate guideline is being developed for those phones and all other after - market and portable devices			0
@entity33 and @entity83 chief @entity82 said a new @entity83 study showed that " visual - manual tasks " associated with hand - held phones and other portable devices increase the risk of getting into a crash by three times			2
researches used video - cameras to study 204 drivers for an average 31 days			0
the study showed that drivers talked on a cell phone 10.6 percent of the time the vehicle was in operation			0
the new guidelines seek to separate devices which assist in driving from those which might distract from it			2
they explicitly allow static or moving maps found on gps navigation devices , with information that assists the driver			0
but it recommends against imagery such as photorealistic , satellite or three - dimensional images			0
the guidelines recommend that devices be designed so that tasks can be completed by the driver with glances away from the roadway of two seconds or less and a cumulative period of 12 seconds or less , in a series of 1.5 second glances			0
the @entity21 is recommending the auto industry adopt the changes in the next three years for all cars , trucks and buses weighing up to 10,000 pounds			1
it has exempted police , fire , the military and other emergency vehicles			0
it says the guidelines are voluntary -- instead of mandatory -- because of the " need for additional research on distraction and its effects on driving " and because of the rapid changes in technology .			2
