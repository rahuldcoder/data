-- you 'd be forgiven for not knowing , but the end of april marks a very important date in the @entity5 calendar			0
" @entity7 " celebrates the transition from winter to summer			2
every year bonfires are lit , songs are sung and it 's not unheard of for parties to go on late into the night			0
why such jubilation ? because the @entity14 winters are dark , cold , long and cruel			0
meanwhile , the summers -- while hardly exotic -- are bright and full of opportunities that are otherwise prohibited by the fearfully inhospitable climate			2
nowhere is this truer than in the far north of @entity5 , where temperatures range from minus @entity19 ( minus 40 f ) in the winter to plus 30 @entity21 ) in the summer			2
along with a portion of neighboring @entity25 , the area is more commonly known as @entity26 , and while the region retains an association with flying reindeer and a jolly bearded man , it is in fact home to a flourishing indigenous people called the @entity34 , as well as a magnificent parade of scenic treats that truly come alive in the summer			1
if you 're not convinced , read on for four reasons to plan your summer vacation in @entity26			1
the midnight sun due to its location north of the @entity44 , @entity26 is bathed in sunlight around the clock , non-stop for two precious months a year			1
this geographical quirk means that -- throughout june and july -- visitors can enjoy the rare spectacle of the midnight sun , where notions of day and night are quickly forgotten			1
the dim pink midnight light lends the landscape an unearthly dimension , and permits the novel experience of midnight forest hikes and even 24 - hour golfing sessions			1
indeed , the excruciatingly picturesque " @entity64 " -- the northernmost golf course in @entity5 , is a favorite among midnight golfers , nestled discreetly as it is between @entity5 's mountain borders and the icy clear @entity63			1
here , the fairways and greens are designed to showcase the scenery and , halfway through the course , players can reflect on their performance over a cup of hot coffee inside a traditional @entity34 tent			0
read related : photographer 's @entity26 journey highlights global warming skiing in your t - shirt situated 250 kilometers up from the @entity44 , @entity80 is the most northerly ski resort in @entity82			1
unlike most @entity82 ski resorts , however , @entity80 does n't really get going until the sun starts hanging around for longer at the beginning of march			2
by june , it is sometimes warm enough on the slopes to ski in shorts and a t - shirt			1
factor in a midnight - sun ski run , and you 've a unique proposition by anybody 's standards			1
novices be warned though -- while @entity80 has some world - class facilities and a range of 17 slopes that it says are suitable for all abilities , the resort is principally renowned for it 's off - piste action , which is both technically challenging and , with a mountainous climb back up , physically demanding			0
summer hikes with its great forests , wild rivers and ominous mountains , @entity26 has acquired the moniker of " @entity82 's last wilderness			1
" here , the mountain range drops towards @entity113 and curves into @entity25 , forming the backbone of @entity5 , and there are around 2,000 mountains and caves that can be explored throughout the region			0
but while the winter months are dark , treacherous and shrouded in a white uniform of snow , summer brings with it the chance to see this part of the world in all its green grassy goodness			1
the magnificent " @entity128 " -- one of @entity5 's most popular trekking routes -- opens up in june			0
the 440 kilometer footslog from the botanical wonderland of @entity132 in the north , to the pretty backpacker 's town of @entity136 in the south , taking in the giant @entity138 -- @entity5 's highest mountain - is divided into four portions that represent roughly one week of hiking each			0
@entity143 huts are dotted along the trail , spread over distances a walker should expect to cover in the course of day ( about nine to 22 kilometers )			0
those on a tight budget -- or with a penchant for roughing it -- can pitch a tent outside and use the facilities			0
summertime " @entity153 " @entity26 is also home to the world 's first and largest " @entity153 " -- where guests bunk down on a bed of ice blocks and a reindeer skin - covered mattress			1
in fact almost everything , from the chandeliers to the tables and chairs , is made from ice and snow			0
first built in 1989 , in the remote village of @entity169 , when the founders of an ice - sculpting course invited some of their students to stay the night , the @entity153 has for years been a winter - only operation			2
but now , for the first time , the hotel will open its frosty doors in the summer			2
as every year , the latest incarnation has been crafted from scratch by a team of sculptors using blocks of frozen water from the nearby @entity184			0
the founders describe it as both boutique accommodation and " ephemeral art project " -- as the fruit of their labor vanishes in the sun as each season comes to an end .			0

the @entity196 region of @entity26 is not as *unusual* a summer *destination* as it might seem
between may and *august* the otherwise inhospitable *terrain* opens up with green expanses and midnight sun
skiing in shorts and t - shirt , *sleeping* in an ice hotel and 24 - hour golf among reasons to visit
