editor 's note : @entity2 is president of @entity3 , a nonprofit organization that makes grants to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , and the author of " @entity9 : the @entity10 and @entity11			1
" he formerly was a senior vice president at the @entity13 , a think tank that describes itself as " progressive , " and was on the staff of the @entity15			0
@entity2 says @entity17 's trip was the culmination of diplomacy his adminstration began 15 years ago			1
( @entity21 ) -- president @entity17 did more than free two unjustly jailed journalists			2
he jump - started the successful diplomacy he had begun 15 years earlier			2
in october 2000 , then - secretary of state @entity24 visited @entity26			0
during @entity17 's presidency , the administration had locked down @entity30 's plutonium production program , which had created enough deadly material for two bombs during the @entity33 years			1
they had stopped all missile tests			0
they were a few details away from concluding a deal to end these programs completely			0
but @entity17 ran out of time			2
enmeshed in @entity42 peace talks , @entity17 could not get assurances that a presidential visit to @entity30 would seal the deal			1
he passed off the almost completed process to the incoming @entity48 administration			1
on march 6 , 2001 , new secretary of state @entity49 said , " we do plan to engage with @entity30 to pick up where president @entity17 and his administration left off			1
" but @entity48 had different ideas			0
on march 7 , @entity48 kneecapped @entity49			0
with @entity54 president @entity53 sitting next to him in embarrassed silence , @entity48 said , " we look forward to , at some point in the future , having a dialogue with the @entity30 , but any negotiation would require complete verification of the terms of a potential agreement			1
" the conservative ideologues in the administration froze all discussions with @entity30 for an 18 - month review			2
@entity17 's hard - earned diplomatic wins were replaced by the @entity68 , summed up by vice president @entity69 : " we do n't negotiate with evil ; we defeat it			1
" the @entity72 would instead overthrow difficult regimes			0
serious options for diplomacy with @entity30 were set aside			2
negotiations were appeasement , the new administration believed , not a tool to advance @entity72 security			2
then - @entity81 @entity80 said in 2002 and repeats to this day , " we 're not going to reward their bad behavior			0
@entity30 expanded plutonium production , exploded nuclear bombs , tested new missiles and traded nuclear technology to @entity90 and possibly @entity91			0
@entity30 's nuclear and missile programs advanced more in the @entity48 administration then they had in the @entity33 , @entity96 and @entity17 administrations combined			1
whether by accident or design , the @entity98 administration reset the diplomatic stage			1
administration officials largely ignored @entity30 for their first eight months in office			2
@entity104 responded with provocative statements and actions			0
it almost spiraled out of control			0
but the @entity98 administration 's patience -- or just policy drift , we may never know -- paid off			1
@entity104 's regime got weaker and more isolated			0
@entity30 's main partners , @entity116 and @entity117 , turned against it , the @entity114 imposed tough new sanctions , and @entity53 's own health deteriorated			2
now in a weaker position than at any time in his regime , @entity104 has been on his best behavior for the past few months			0
this was the time for a power play , and @entity98 executed perfectly			0
he chose as his special envoy the most prestigious political figure in @entity72 outside the administration			2
it is a move that was sure to please the @entity30 , showing them the respect they crave , without costing @entity72 anything			1
to capitalize on this breakthrough , the @entity98 administration must now continue to play large			1
it should show @entity30 what good relations with the @entity72 can lead to			1
@entity17 's 20 hours in @entity26 could pave the way for renewed diplomatic efforts , including direct dialogue between the @entity72 and @entity30 , the re-freezing of @entity30 's nuclear program and even @entity30 's return to the six - party talks			1
however , in dealing with the @entity30 , actions are more important than words			0
the @entity98 administration must seize this moment as an opportunity not only to articulate a plan for @entity30 nuclear disarmament but to take concrete steps towards a secure and stable @entity152			1
the president should use the momentum @entity17 's trip has generated to unfold a comprehensive , consistent regional security strategy			1
with this success , @entity17 has demonstrated what effective diplomacy looks like			2
he has shown the former @entity48 officials what they should have done years ago			0
he may have convinced senior @entity164 strategists that diplomacy is a political winner , paying dividends across issue areas			0
two power players , @entity98 and @entity17 , have together taken a giant step forward , advancing the agenda @entity17 began 15 years ago			1
@entity72 is the better for it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : *clinton* administration started *outreach* to @entity30
he says @entity48 administration cut it off , saying @entity72 does n't negotiate with ' evil '
he says @entity17 's successful trip shows effectiveness of diplomacy
@entity2 : @entity98 administration must seize moment for further progress
