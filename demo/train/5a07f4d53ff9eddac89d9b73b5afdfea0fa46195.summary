-- he used to terrorize defenses , but now former @entity4 and @entity5 striker @entity3 is tearing up the turf after clinching his first @entity8 winner			1
seven years ago @entity3 set up his own yard -- @entity10 -- and on sunday he witnessed his first top - flight success as @entity12 , a horse he also bred , romped to victory over a stellar field in the @entity16 at @entity17			1
" he 's the apple of my eye as everyone knows and he was pretty spectacular out there , " said @entity3 , who fought back tears amid the emotion of the win following a superb ride by jockey @entity22			1
" @entity22 was a bit closer to the pace than we envisaged but he 's a relentless galloper and he quickened again , " added @entity3			2
" he kept galloping and he 's a superstar			0
" @entity3 was thrust with @entity4 , @entity32 and @entity5 jerseys to sign in the winners ' enclosure , which was likened to a mosh pit at the music festival @entity38			0
@entity12 showed the sort of turn of pace with which @entity3 used to bedevil defenders during his playing days amid a world class field , including @entity46 winner @entity44 , trained by @entity47			1
it proved a tough weekend for @entity47 , a day after his star horse @entity49 suffered a shock defeat in the @entity51 at @entity52 saturday			2
as such , @entity3 proved the star turn of @entity16 racing at the weekend , a fitting result following the death just two months earlier of @entity57 , the mother of @entity12			1
the @entity60 - trained stallion had finished third at the same race at the @entity17 in 2012 , but this time his rivals failed to match his pace heading to the winning post as @entity12 added to previous victories at both @entity66 and @entity67			1
" the first thing to say is he [ @entity22 ] gave him a brilliant ride , " said @entity60 , who hinted @entity12 is now likely to compete at the @entity69 race at @entity70 next month at @entity66 rather than return to the @entity72 where he was eighth a year ago			1
" i was close to pulling him out but there are n't too many @entity16 levers so you have to run			0
the horse never lets us down			0
" in an interview with @entity0 earlier this year , @entity3 , who also houses two of @entity84 's horses at his stables , admitted that horse racing wins can only come a close second to scoring goals in his footballing heyday			2
introduced to the sport of kings by his dad @entity93 , @entity3 also revealed he still struggled with the concept of merely watching a sporting occasion from the stands			0
" with football you always feel in control			0
on the pitch , you can always do something to make something happen			0
your destiny is in your hands in many ways , " he said .			0
