-- a deadly car bomb attack on a busy market in @entity3 wednesday continued a bloody trend of atrocities in @entity6 during october			1
ten attacks have been carried out so far this month , resulting in nearly 400 deaths , according to security expert @entity9 , chief executive of @entity10			1
@entity9 gives @entity0 his assessment on the latest attack and the challenges facing the @entity6 forces			1
why @entity3 and why now ? no one 's actually releasing any statement , but i would say it 's a retaliatory action to the seizing of @entity19 , a town in the @entity22 district by @entity6 troops almost two weeks ago on october 17			1
the @entity24 is setting off devices and suicide bombs in other parts of the country to draw attention away from @entity22 to make it harder for them			1
because obviously troops will be deployed to the areas perceived to be the greatest threat			0
it 's a pretty smart tactic on behalf of the @entity24			1
why did the attackers target the marketplace @entity37 ? it 's indiscriminate			1
it 's the purest essence of terrorism			1
it is to absolutely instill fear and terror into the general populace			0
whether that works effectively and advantageously for them in the longer run , i do n't think so			0
because ultimately it will be the local community who will be feeding intelligence back to @entity6 intelligence service , the @entity52			2
if you alienate that community by targeting them then you 're not winning the support of people who are potentially going to hide you out or not disclose your whereabouts , your location or your operations			2
it is a risky tactic			1
it is showing the arrogance of the @entity24			2
they do n't care who they target -- they just want to terrorize the whole nation			2
how much can be read into the timing of the attacks ? it coincides with @entity71 being in the country			0
it 's fundamentally saying : " you 've got a high - ranked world leader who 's a guest in the country , and we 're showing you we 're still kicking your backside , " for lack of better words			0
it 's really to make president @entity82 lose face , as well as to continue the turmoil across the country and to show to the international community that the @entity24 is winning			1
it is the latest in a series of deadly attacks this october			0
why is the @entity24 so active now ? the @entity24 are always more active up in the mountains in the autumn months because it 's far harder for the enemy to be successful			1
it is colder , the terrain 's harder			0
the @entity24 are experts at fighting in mountainous regions			1
the @entity24 will generally come down on to the flats during the summer months and during the winter months they retreat back up into the mountains			2
what would conditions be like on the ground ? it would be very cold , very brutal			0
it would be tough , tough terrain for any military forced to try to fight against the @entity24			2
they are kings of their castle in many respects in those regions			0
can you see the fighting intensifying between now and the end of the year ? the @entity6 military will find it incredibly hard going to battle against them as the winter months progress			1
there is very possibly going to be some kind of withdrawal , maybe the closer we get to the end of the year , because it starts becoming more and more brutal before the early months of the year			0
it 's like @entity124 ; you do n't want to be down there in january or february			0
however the government ca n't lose face and they ca n't seem to be losing			0
is there anything the government can do to halt the spate of suicide attacks ? if you have got sorties from the @entity24 coming down into @entity134 and @entity135 and undertaking attacks there , it 's very difficult to intersect			1
quite often what you may have is a group that is working in @entity135 and @entity134 who will be the resource ; they 'll be the ones doing the reconnaissance , looking at the various targets and then the suicide bombers would likely come down to be briefed by the local team and pointed to the explosives , wherever they might be			0
it demonstrates their determined campaign to embarrass and humiliate @entity82 's government			0
ireporter : " increasing chaos " in @entity6			2

of recent attacks by the @entity24 , @entity9 says : " it 's the purest essence of terrorism "
