-- everybody has problems here and there			1
some are just bigger than others			1
maybe a shiftless tenant wo n't pay his rent , a dishonest contractor is ripping off your grandmother or a meth - addicted actress murdered your boyfriend			1
in the land of @entity16 noir , a sunny place full of shady people , these are not uncommon problems			1
when you need a solution , quick , you call @entity21			1
he cuts through the red tape			1
it may not always be moral , ethical , or legal but he gets the job done			2
he 's the shortcut man			2
@entity21 is the wisecracking creation of author , @entity29 and the hero of his newest novel , " @entity32 , " hitting bookstore shelves this week			1
this is @entity35 ' second novel featuring @entity21			1
set in present - day @entity36 , @entity35 carries on in the classic noir tradition showing the seamy underside of the city and its criminal tendencies			1
however , @entity35 deftly puts his own spin on the hard - boiled detective story			1
his " @entity45 " novels are fun , sexy , and darkly humorous			1
he 's now winning rave reviews from critics and fans and drawing comparisons to some noir legends like @entity51			1
@entity35 took a long and winding path to his success as an author			1
he 's the son of the famed @entity56 screenwriter and director , @entity35 , responsible for such classics as " @entity59			1
" he died when the author was just six years old but the two share a love of quirky characters and screwball plots			2
@entity29 grew up amongst the glitz and glamour of @entity36			2
he spent time as a submarine sailor for the @entity67 , calibrating tools as a metrologist , also as a musician and a screenwriter before becoming a novelist at age 57			2
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity35 about his burgeoning career , his authorial influences and his famous @entity76			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : for new readers , tell me a little bit about @entity21 and what exactly is a shortcut man ? @entity35 : @entity21 is a guy who was thrown out of the @entity84			1
he 's ended up in a position where he pursues justice for his clients with the aim not of pleasing the civil code but of actually doing justice for the people			2
the shortcuts refer to his ignoring various codes , laws , protocols and just doing the right thing			2
that 's what he wants to do , the right thing			2
@entity0 : even though the books are set in present day @entity36 they have a very classic , noir style			1
what drew you to this type of story ? @entity35 : i wish i could say i did it on purpose but i did n't			1
that 's just the way i told the story			1
the first time i tried writing it in the third person and i realized it was n't working			2
then i tried writing in the first person and i got a flow going			2
then i understood how to write for " @entity117			2
" also , sheerly by chance i found the way to write about any subject that appeals to me is through @entity21			2
so @entity21 knows as much as i do but when he 's wrong about things of course it 's my character who 's wrong and not me			2
@entity0 : you share parts of your past with @entity21			2
is there a lot of your personality in him and vice versa ? @entity35 : oh yes			1
i am not a shortcut man , though i admire @entity21 for his strength , his bravery , his success with women and his beautiful cars but i was a submarine sailor and a musician			2
so when i introduce him and how he became the shortcut man when someone stole his gearshift from his car in @entity142 that is actually a true story			1
that 's really how i handled that			2
there 's a story in the first book about going to the jazz club and trying to impress the girl , bringing up the song , " @entity155 " by @entity156 , impressing her then going up and asking the band to play that song and the guy goes , we just played it man			1
that actually happened to me too			2
that 's the beauty of this particular character that anything can go in there			0
so i 'm having a great deal of fun writing for @entity21 and i hope to do that as long as i live			1
@entity0 : so how did you go from submarine sailor to musician to successful writer ? @entity35 : well , had i been a success at any of the other things i had tried before writing a novel , i would have never got to writing novels			1
it 's just i got tired of writing screenplays , being ripped apart and changed and your name left on them , which is disconcerting			0
you know a screenplay is a blueprint for a movie and it takes an expert to read a blueprint			0
finally , i thought , i 'm just going to tell this story the right way at least in one form , so i got around to writing the novel and discovered how much i really enjoy that form			1
@entity0 : your father was the famous @entity56 screenwriter and director , @entity35			1
you mention him several times in your first book			0
was he your inspiration to become a writer ? @entity35 : he died when i was six years old so i never got to ask him the writing questions that occurred to me later but i certainly love his work			1
i 'm a fan of it and i love it and my appreciation of him because i have few memories left , is the kind way he treated his characters in his movies			0
my primary knowledge of him like everybody else is through his films but i feel i have a special insight when i watch them			0
he was known for giving his characters outlandish names and i 'm convinced that the reason he did that is because when you give a specific name to a character , in your mind they fully inhabit that name so that name becomes a shorthand for that exact character			0
so instead of saying @entity221 you have @entity222 , and @entity222 is going to leap to mind and you 're going to be able to more easily write in his stead			0
like @entity226 , from the new novel , that name was specifically tailored , to me that name sounds like a fat guy			0
so every time i wrote @entity229 he fully was in my mind			0
i do n't know if other people do that but that 's why i do that and i think that 's why my father did that			0
@entity0 : do you ever think about what your father would say about your novels ? @entity35 : i think he would very much enjoy them			1
he would enjoy them because i enjoy them			0
they 're not a drill to write			0
i do n't write to a formula			0
i think i 'm kind to my characters			0
i do n't have anybody who 's in there just to accomplish certain things , to facilitate plot twists			0
i think you create characters and in a book that has any feel of life , they have to act in their own self interest			0
that means making them real and even the bad ones have good parts in them			0
@entity0 : you 've been described as a worthy successor to @entity51 but what writers have influenced you ? @entity35 : well , there 's @entity268 , @entity269 and his series of novels about the @entity273 navy			1
i like @entity274 of course			0
i 've read every bit of @entity274 and i love @entity277 but who does n't ? i like @entity279 , his novels more than his poetry			1
i loved @entity282 growing up , the @entity284 series , i must have read them ten times			0
lately i 've been reading @entity287			0
recently i read " @entity288 , " also " @entity289 " and some @entity290			0
what i found out about the great writers , they always have humor in their books			0
they do n't set out to be funny but their notice of life as it passes has funny moments and they get it			0
i like to read more from a civilian viewpoint			0
i do n't read a book to say this is how the author did this and this is how he did that			0
i just like to read a great story			1
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity35 : book number three is already finished and in the can			1
i have n't polished it but the manuscript is complete			0
signing with @entity315 seriously unleashed my ambition			0
i 've been writing all sorts of things			0
i 'm just finishing something now called , " @entity320			0
" it 's a story about a man living in today 's times who comes into possession of a clock that supposedly stops if your spouse is unfaithful			1
so the clock stops and what do you believe in 2012 ? it takes place outside @entity21 's world			0
it could exist beside it but they do n't come together			0
apart from that , look for " @entity339 " next year and i hope you 'll read it			0
read an excerpt from " @entity32			0
