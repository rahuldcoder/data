-- five - time world champions @entity1 needed to come from two goals down to beat underdogs the @entity3 3 - 2 in the final of the @entity5 in @entity6 on sunday night			1
@entity1 celebrated a third @entity5 triumph following victories in 2005 and 1997			0
captain @entity9 headed an 84th - minute winner to end the hopes of the plucky @entity12 , who scored twice in the first half - hour in @entity14			1
@entity15 , who netted in the shock 2 - 0 win against @entity19 champions @entity20 in the semi-finals , put the @entity3 ahead in the 10th minute			1
a massive upset seemed to be on the cards when captain @entity24 doubled the lead in the 27th minute , but @entity1 reduced the deficit just 41 seconds after the half - time break through @entity28			1
the striker then leveled with his fifth goal of the tournament in the 74th minute before @entity9 rose highest to ensure that @entity1 retained the title			1
@entity1 went into the game seeking a massive improvement on their dismal showing in laboring to beat hosts @entity6 1 - 0 in the semi-finals			0
but @entity40 's @entity3 team , beaten 3 - 0 by @entity1 in the group stage , took a shock lead when @entity15 found space in the penalty area to guide home @entity47 's fierce right - wing cross for his third goal of the tournament			1
goalkeeper @entity50 continued his fine form to keep the @entity52 at bay , then @entity24 finished off a superb counter-attack that the @entity55 would have been proud of			0
the veteran , who earlier in the tournament said his worst footballing memory was a 7 - 0 drubbing by @entity1 when playing for the @entity3 under - 23 side , set the speedy @entity61 free down the left			2
he then controlled the return pass to cut inside @entity64 and slot past @entity66 -- extending his national goalscoring record to 41			0
@entity50 then saved a low angled shot from @entity28 , then the @entity69 forward headed over the bar 10 minutes before the interval			0
but @entity28 struck a killer blow soon after the restart when otherwise - impressive @entity3 defender @entity74 allowed him to collect @entity76 's pass inside the penalty area and swivel to fire past a helpless @entity50			2
@entity1 surged forward in search of an equalizer , and @entity82 's new signing @entity76 thought he 'd scored it when @entity50 beat out his downward header via the underside of the crossbar while the @entity87 keeper appeared to be behind the line			0
however , the referee ruled otherwise to the @entity52 's disgust , which seemed to be justified by television replays			0
@entity50 denied @entity28 when clear through on goal in the 70th minute , but soon after the forward was on hand to poach the leveler			0
@entity76 beat full - back @entity47 down the left and his low cross was deflected into the path of @entity99 , who prodded the ball against the underside of the bar -- and @entity28 headed home the rebound			1
with the @entity12 visibly tiring , it was no surprise when @entity1 claimed the winner			2
@entity9 found space in the box to powerfully head a corner from second - half substitute @entity110 into the net off the left - hand upright , with the @entity3 defense having crucially left the post unguarded			1
it was @entity1 's third @entity5 triumph , having also won in 1997 , and represented a 14th victory in the last 15 meetings with the @entity3 coach @entity119 has now presided over seven wins in 20 days , with five at the @entity5 and two in @entity123 qualifiers .			2

@entity1 come from two goals down to beat @entity3 3 - 2 in @entity5 final
@entity15 and @entity24 put @entity12 ahead in first half - hour
@entity28 pulls one back 41 seconds after half - time and then levels score
captain @entity9 heads home the winner in the 84th minute as @entity1 retain title
