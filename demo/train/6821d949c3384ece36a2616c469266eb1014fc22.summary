-- perhaps the most interesting kick of the @entity2 so far comes from a young adult who is paralyzed from the waist down			1
clad in a metal vest , sporting a blue cap dotted with electrodes , he kicked off the world 's biggest soccer championship in an exoskeleton			1
it was , according to the scientist behind the exoskeleton 's kick , " meant to shock the world			1
" but even more shocking than the exoskeleton 's first tentative steps is learning how it worked : controlled by the paralyzed patient 's mind			1
before there was a mind - controlled exoskeleton , there was a neuroscientist named dr. @entity29 who was curious about " brain storms , " flurries of activity caused by neurons at any given moment			1
" we have about 100 million cells interconnected in our brains , " said @entity29 , a professor of neuroscience at @entity36			0
" they communicate with one another through electrical signals			0
" @entity29 wanted to know how brain storms generated behavior , so he began recording them			2
" we wanted to understand how large populations of brain cells interact , " how memories are built , how we move our bodies or how we sense the world around us , said @entity29			2
scientists quickly realized that decoding the alphabet of neurons in the brain meant that its language could be transmitted to devices outside the brain			2
thus began the creation of the mind - controlled exoskeleton , or what @entity29 and his colleagues call a " brain - machine interface , " a way of connecting brain tissue to artificial devices			1
" we realized that there was a tremendous potential application for rehabilitation in severely paralyzed patients , " @entity29 said			2
paper - thin electrodes ( that can both record and transmit neuronal information to the exoskeleton ) are the conduit between the patient 's brain and the exoskeleton			1
in the case of human patients , most of the electrodes reside in a cap that he or she wears			0
the patient thinks about moving , the generated activity is translated , and that activates the exoskeleton			1
" we are able to show that you can read the signals and send them to devices , " said @entity29 , adding that the devices , in turn , move according to the voluntary intention of the patient			0
that is the simple explanation			0
what is more complicated is how brain signals , muscle movement and spinal cord activity all coalesced into that dazzling opening kick			0
@entity29 is hoping to build on what he and his team have already accomplished to create a full - body exoskeleton			2
that will involve recording tens of thousands of neurons simultaneously , he said			0
" ( one day ) we 'll be walking in @entity107 and we 'll see a person walking on the streets that could not walk before , " he said			0
" i think in our lifetime we 'll see that			0
