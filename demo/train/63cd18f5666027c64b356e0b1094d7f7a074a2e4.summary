@entity0 , @entity1 -- some of the toughest criticism of @entity1 's pro-democracy movement comes from an unlikely source : the 25 - year - old niece of @entity7 , who says @entity1 party politics do nothing but support military rule			1
it 's an environment , she said , her late aunt is partly responsible for			2
@entity13 says she 's not interested in " perpetuating a really ineffectual form of politics ... because of my name			1
" " at this stage , we are in a state in @entity1 where so - called democratic forces are only interested in coming into office			1
so ultimately , they only prop up dictatorships , " she told @entity2 from her home in @entity0			2
she raised her voice as she described what she feels is the core of @entity1 's political problems : the lack of a true democratic culture			1
instead , she said , the country is run by power grabbers			1
" ultimately to them , it 's a game of revolving chairs			0
as long as they get to be in one , they do n't care who 's in the other one			0
" @entity13 said her aunt played this " game of revolving chairs " at huge costs to the @entity41 , shattering the clan 's unity			1
in 1996 , @entity13 's father , @entity45 , was gunned down by @entity1 security forces in front of the family compound			1
his sister , @entity49 , was prime minister at the time			0
his widow blames her sister - in - law for the killing , because @entity45 had become a political rival			0
watch @entity13 say she 's not " interested in being a symbol " » " we have to seriously look at her political legacy , which is deeply flawed , " @entity13 said			1
" both her governments were known for widespread corruption , for an abuse of human rights , and for an excess of police violence			0
" @entity13 was estranged from her aunt and had not spoken to her since @entity7 returned to the nation for @entity1 elections			1
@entity7 was killed in a bloody december 27 attack			2
her niece says now that @entity7 has herself been killed , she does not look back in anger			1
watch a struggle over the @entity13 legacy » " we also have to take into account that @entity7 died bravely and that the attack on her is ultimately an attack on her country , " she said			1
she added that she did attend her aunt 's funeral			2
some here in @entity1 believe @entity13 -- and not @entity7 's 19 - year - old son , @entity78 -- is the true heir to the @entity13 political dynasty			1
@entity13 said she 's a political person and does campaign for a splinter group of the @entity82			2
that group is now run by her mother following the death of her father			0
she said her main political goal is to empower @entity1 's largely disenfranchised masses and end what she calls the perpetual cycle of " dynastic " cronyism			1
what her role would be in making that happen remains the great unknown			0
" what i think we need to do is open the field , " said @entity13 , who went to college in the @entity97 and graduate school in @entity99			2
" it has to stop being this autocratic , dynastic environment			0
... when that day comes and this happens -- that we have an open field -- if there 's a way for me to serve this country , then i would be proud to			0
" until then , she said , she exerts her power from her writing			0
@entity13 is a successful columnist , author and poet ; a staunch critic of @entity116 's government			1
and though her name would probably propel her to the highest levels of @entity1 politics almost instantly , she said that wo n't happen anytime soon			0
" i 'm not interested in being a symbol for anyone , " she said emphatically			0
" and i 'm not interested in perpetuating a really ineffectual form of politics simply because of my name			0
" she added , " i have never believed in dynastic politics , or the politics of birthright			0
... i think that 's dangerous to the cause of democracy in @entity1 , and ultimately does n't serve the people			2
