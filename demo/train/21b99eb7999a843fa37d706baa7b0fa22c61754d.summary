-- what 's in a name ? if you are @entity4 , years of trouble and the shadow of a senior @entity8 figure lurking over your every move			1
@entity4 's arrival at @entity13 's airport wednesday caused a brief flutter of excitement			1
could it be that one of the most senior figures in @entity8 had been detained in dramatic ( and highly unlikely ) fashion after stepping off an @entity21 flight from @entity22 in @entity23 ? the confusion arose because @entity25 -- regarded as @entity8 's third - most - senior figure -- had long been associated with an alias identical to @entity4 's name			1
the two men do have some common background			0
both were @entity32 military officers who joined the @entity33			1
@entity4 was a major and an explosives expert in @entity32 's @entity36			1
he went on trial in 1987 for his @entity39 connections and was dismissed from the army			0
both he and @entity41 -- then a lieutenant and apparently a more active militant -- left for @entity23 and joined @entity45 's jihad			1
by 1988 , @entity4 was fighting @entity47 forces and their surrogates in @entity49			1
" i last saw @entity4 in 1989 when we fought together , " @entity50 , another former jihadist from @entity32 , told @entity0 wednesday			1
" i also knew @entity41 well and fought alongside with him during our jihad , " added @entity50 , who is also the son of the blind sheikh now serving a jail term in the @entity54 for his involvement in the 1993 attempt to blow up the @entity57			1
according to a source who followed @entity8 at the time , @entity60 fell out with @entity45 and @entity63 , @entity8 's current leader , soon after arriving in @entity23			2
by about 1990 , the source says , @entity4 had given up the gun in favor of contributing to a magazine in @entity22 -- @entity68 or " @entity69			1
" nearly a decade later , @entity41 became a wanted man for his part in the plots to blow up the @entity54 embassies in @entity74 and @entity75			2
@entity54 authorities published his profile as part of the @entity80 program and listed " @entity25 " as an alias			0
and the real @entity60 's nightmare began			0
by then , he had married a @entity23 woman and was living as a political refugee in @entity22			0
for 10 years , @entity4 was regularly confused with @entity8 's rising star			1
he adopted the e-mail address " @entity88 @ ...			0
. , " and from his home in @entity22 's @entity90 began a campaign to clear his name			2
@entity0 has obtained a copy of a letter @entity4 wrote to the @entity95 high commissioner for refugees in 2009 that recounts his appeals to authorities in several countries			2
" i am trying to resettle my normal life in @entity23 after getting married to a @entity23 lady but have accomplished nothing as a result of the @entity32 and @entity106 regime 's pressure on @entity23 agencies and my moral obduracy , " he began			1
@entity4 said his children had been expelled from school and friends , neighbors and relatives had become informants for intelligence agencies			2
" after the agencies lost hope to force me to accept fake @entity8 no. 3 role and the big 9/11 lie , they attempted to kill me and my two elder sons by despicable means , " @entity4 claims , adding that at one point there had been an attempt to poison him			2
in desperation , he told the @entity126 , he appealed to president @entity127 and also asked the @entity128 to detain him			0
" hoping to put an end to this preposterous puppet show and to put myself under the responsibility of @entity128 , i sent an e-mail on 7th september 2005 to the head office of @entity128 requesting to be arrested and to face all accusations raised against me in a fair trial , " he wrote			0
he did not receive a reply			0
somehow , after being denied travel papers for more than 10 years , @entity4 was apparently able to obtain travel documents from the @entity32 embassy in @entity22			1
and then he boarded a plane to @entity13 wednesday , in an effort to clear his name and expunge the shadow of @entity25			0
the confusion over his real identity persisted for some hours after his arrival			0
eventually , the @entity32 @entity147 confirmed that @entity41 was still at large			1
" @entity4 is not @entity25 , " the ministry said			2
" there is obvious confusion of data among security apparatus and the media			0
they are two different people			0
" but the real @entity60 's troubles are far from over			0
the @entity147 confirmed to @entity0 that @entity4 was still a wanted man and faced charges of terrorism and conspiracy to topple the regime			1
he will remain in detention and appear before the @entity162 , the ministry said			0
@entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			0

there are many *similarities* between @entity168 and @entity41
@entity4 has fought for years to clear his name
@entity32 's @entity147 says @entity41 is still at large
