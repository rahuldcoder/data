-- the high - profile case of a girl adopted by a @entity4 couple is moving toward another legal showdown after @entity7 's governor ordered the extradition of the girl 's biological @entity10 father , who is accused of custodial interference			1
gov. @entity13 on wednesday ordered that @entity14 be extradited to @entity4 after she became convinced that the father disobeyed an @entity7 court order to allow the adoptive couple , @entity17 and @entity18 , to visit @entity19 , 4			1
but @entity14 's attorneys told @entity0 that they will challenge the extradition order at a hearing scheduled for october 3			1
@entity14 turned himself in to authorities thursday morning in @entity24 , @entity7 , and was then released on $ 10,000 bail , said @entity26 , his attorney in @entity4			1
@entity13 said wednesday that her goal " in the @entity31 case has been to encourage both mr. @entity14 and the @entity18 family to reach a quick settlement and come to an agreement that protects @entity31 's best interests			2
" " i said previously that i was willing to delay mr. @entity14 's extradition to @entity4 as long as all parties were working together in good faith to pursue such a settlement , " @entity13 said in a written statement			1
" unfortunately , it has become clear that @entity14 is not acting in good faith			2
" @entity14 's attorneys claim their client did not break a law in the ongoing custody dispute			2
in june , a divided @entity45 @entity44 sided with the @entity46 , who are white , when @entity14 sought to assert his parental rights			1
they had legally adopted @entity31 when she was a baby			0
the justices said the adoption was proper and did not intrude on the federal rights of the father , a registered member of the @entity55 tribe , over where his daughter would live			0
the court said @entity14 could not rely on the @entity58 for relief because he never had legal or physical custody at the time of adoption proceedings , which were initiated by the @entity64 @entity45 birth mother without his knowledge			0
the father then took his case to @entity7 courts			2
timeline of ' @entity31 ' adoption case @entity14 refused to hand over the child after the @entity44 order , a family court in @entity4 developed a " transition plan " to ease any transfer , taking into account the girl 's age , sensitivities of the parties involved and the @entity82 dynamic underlying the larger legal dispute			1
@entity14 did not attend a transition meeting , saying he had @entity85 training out of state and was unable to get out of that duty			0
the @entity4 family court then ordered that @entity31 be turned over immediately			0
@entity14 refused to hand the child over and was cited for contempt			2
a warrant was issued on august 10 for " custodial interference			1
" as he did thursday , @entity14 turned himself in to authorities in @entity7 and posted bail after that warrant was issued			1
@entity13 acted after @entity4 gov. @entity95 filed a request with the @entity97 seeking " the prompt return of a @entity4 child to her adoptive parents and ensuring that mr. @entity14 is held accountable for criminally withholding @entity101 from her parents for nearly one month , " according to a court document			1
@entity13 's " unfortunate " order does not mean @entity14 will be extradited , according to another attorney , @entity105			1
an @entity7 judge will determine whether the father broke any laws , he said , adding his client did not do so			2
@entity14 and his attorneys " will appear before a judicial officer , point out the defects in the order and defend themselves , " @entity105 told @entity0			2
@entity105 also claimed his client has tried to accommodate the @entity46 during the appeal process			0
but @entity95 , in her court filing in @entity7 , said @entity14 has been in " willful defiance " of @entity4 courts that ordered him to return @entity31 to the @entity46			1
@entity4 wants to prosecute @entity14 for custodial interference			1
the @entity97 issued an emergency stay on friday to temporarily delay the transfer of @entity31 to the @entity46			0
the order was made public on tuesday			0
case has tested federal law the extradition order does not affect the current placement of @entity31 , according to @entity13			1
she would be able to stay with @entity14 's relatives			2
the four - year case has spanned state lines and tested an unusual federal law			0
the @entity46 legally adopted @entity31 at birth in september 2009			0
when @entity14 learned of her adoption a few months later , he asserted his custody rights under the @entity58 , setting off a lengthy legal fight			0
a family court judge ruled in @entity14 's favor in late 2011 , and he took his daughter back			2
the @entity46 have fought ever since to have @entity31 returned , arguing federal law does not define an unwed biological father as a parent			1
@entity13 claimed that @entity14 denies visitation between the adoptive couple and the girl			0
" he is acting in open violation of both @entity7 and @entity4 courts , which have granted custody of @entity31 to the @entity46			1
finally , he has cut off negotiations with the @entity46 and shown no interest in pursuing any other course than yet another lengthy legal battle , " the governor said			0
" as governor , i am committed to upholding the rule of law			0
as a mother , i believe it is in the best interests of @entity31 to help end this controversy and find her a permanent home , " @entity13 said			0
@entity18 has told reporters that @entity31 is being " illegally held against the wishes of her parents and the courts , " and she pleaded for her daughter 's return			0
@entity0 's @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
