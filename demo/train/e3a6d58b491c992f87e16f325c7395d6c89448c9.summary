-- given that @entity2 has been home to the likes of @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , it 's no surprise that the city offers a wealth of cultural events			1
but @entity2 are also prepared to brave their bitter winters to enjoy traditional outdoor celebrations			1
pancakes , known as blini , are the stars of the @entity16			1
@entity16 / @entity17 ( february / march ) this traditional festival , with its roots in pagan @entity21 celebrations , all but disappeared between 1917 and 2002 , but it 's now one of the city 's best - loved celebrations			2
it precedes @entity29 and @entity30 pancakes , known as blini , feature prominently in the week - long festivities			2
round , golden blini are said to symbolize the @entity21 sun and are eaten in huge quantities all week , topped with anything from jam to caviar			2
the festival usually includes an attempt to break a blini - related world record ; in 2004 the festival set the record for the tallest pile of pancakes ever made and at the 2008 festival bakers created a map of the world out of , you guessed it , blini			0
other festival shenanigans include traditional @entity56 games , troika ( sled ) rides , folk dancing , and a final - day masquerade and parade made up of musicians , jesters , stiltwalkers , acrobats , and carnival entertainers			0
the traditional " @entity16 brawl , " an apparently good - natured group fist - fight , is probably best avoided			0
Â» @entity70 ( march / april ) each year @entity30 's finest opera , dance , theater and musical productions compete to win a coveted @entity75 at @entity2 's @entity70			1
held over three weeks at venues around the city , the festival is a fantastic opportunity to experience the best in contemporary culture from all over @entity30 , conveniently gathered together in one city			1
what do you think are @entity2 's seasonal highlights ? let us know below			0
@entity87 ( 9 may ) @entity87 is a national holiday in @entity30 to commemorate @entity90 's surrender to the @entity91 in @entity92 -- still known in @entity30 as the " @entity93			0
" in @entity2 , the day is marked by an impressive military parade in @entity95 and remembrance events in @entity97 to honor @entity30 's fallen soldiers			1
there are firework displays in the evening			0
part somber remembrance , part celebration , @entity87 is a dramatic reminder of what many @entity30 still regard as the @entity91 's proudest hour , and of the millions of @entity30 killed in the war			0
december nights ( december ) just as @entity2 's december chill is turning nights on the town into an endurance contest , the @entity107 comes to the rescue with a series of outstanding evenings of classical music			2
conceived by renowned @entity30 pianist @entity119 and held annually since 1981 , december night 's program of @entity30 and international musical talent is one of the year 's cultural highlights			2
as well as world - class classical concerts , the festival also features exhibitions of artworks related to that year 's musical theme			0
@entity127 ( late december / early january ) given the ferocity of @entity2 's winter , if you 're planning to join in with the @entity127 fun in @entity132 you 'd do well to warm up with a shot or two of vodka before you venture outside			1
in the park you 'll find traditional folk music , dancing , and troika rides , while elsewhere in the city you can see glittering ice sculptures being built in @entity95 and hundreds of snowmen lining @entity143			1
while some hardy @entity2 use the festival as an opportunity to join the " @entity147 , " it is n't recommended -- membership involves swimming in ice holes carved in the freezing @entity150 .			0

@entity158 , golden blini ( pancakes ) are the real stars of the @entity16
