-- those countries in the @entity2 that have been spared political upheaval find themselves enmeshed in a different sort of battle of late			1
as @entity8 , the @entity9 and @entity10 split what 's left of the region 's tourists , each is fighting to pull in the lion 's share			2
their weapon of choice ? theme parks			2
currently , @entity17 and its scrappier sibling , @entity19 , are duking it out with @entity21 for the rights to build the region 's first @entity24 theme park			1
not surprisingly , the @entity2 version of @entity27 ( there are already outlets in @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32 ) would also be the world 's largest			1
" [ the competition ] is getting quite fierce , " says @entity34 , director of operations and development at @entity36 , the local agents for @entity38 , who first developed the brand 's entertainment complex			2

they all want to be first			0
" as one of the most downloaded apps of all times ( the game has amassed 1.7 billion downloads since launching in 2010 ) , @entity24 ' name recognition is almost unbeatable			2
@entity54 is a global phenomenon , it 's proved particularly popular in the region			0
over a fifth of all downloads come from the @entity9 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
@entity60 , the developers of the game , are even toying with the idea of creating a localized version of the game			0
" everyone recognizes the game , from little kids to adults , " notes @entity34			0
" it 's a brand new concept to the region			0
no one has it , and everyone wants it			0
they want to be ahead of their neighbors all the time -- they want to beat them at everything			0
" at $ 60 million , the budget for @entity83 is fairly modest , by entertainment complex standards			0
according to @entity86 , a theme park consultant and the managing director at @entity89 , it makes for a fairly inexpensive investment			1
" it 's really a great concept for the @entity2 , especially for areas looking to grow their attractions , " he says			1
" the scale is small , but it still has a brand name associated with it , and a very current one at that			0
it gives [ whoever wins it ] a name attraction without the risk of a more expensive brand			0

other cities are starting to come up with theme park concepts that are either branded , big , or bizarre			1
in addition to courting @entity24 , @entity17 has expressed interest in a @entity116 - themed resort			1
according to @entity17 newspaper @entity118 , @entity117 has been in talks to build it on @entity122 , adjacent to @entity123			1
@entity10 , a country who relies more on cultural tourism than man - made gimmicks ( @entity129 - listed @entity128 is the most popular destination , attracting over 600,000 visitors in 2011 ) , seems to be taking a tip from its neighbor			0
@entity134 are developing a $ 1.5 billion entertainment resort in @entity136 , complete with @entity138 themed rides and a flight simulator attraction			0
before the 2008 recession , @entity106 had several entertainment - themed developments in the pipeline , mainly slated for the still undeveloped neigborhood of @entity144			2
though some -- like the largest @entity148 theme park outside of the @entity149 -- were shelved in the downturn , others have found their legs in @entity106 's recent economic resurgence			1
one of these projects includes @entity154 , which has a soft launch scheduled for december as part of the @entity157 residential and commercial development			1
it plans to usurp @entity123 as the world 's largest indoor theme park , and will include four zones , which , separately , would be a massive undertaking			1
perhaps the most unique is the @entity165 , a @entity167 - themed segment that will include animatronic dinosaurs			1
two other zones are dedicated to the characters of @entity171 and @entity172			0
" we want this park to be one of the center points in the future of @entity106 , " explains @entity173 , the vice president of marketing for @entity174 , the developer behind the project			1
" as such , you do n't want to build something that wo n't get global attention , and if that means it 's big , that 's what you do			2
there 's no point in building it small			0

@entity17 , @entity19 and @entity21 are competing to for the rights to build the @entity2 's first @entity24 theme park .
though the details are n't finalized , the park will also be the biggest in the world .
@entity106 is also planning to open @entity154 , the world 's biggest indoor theme park in december .
the new park will feature animatronic dinosaurs , which walk and move around .
