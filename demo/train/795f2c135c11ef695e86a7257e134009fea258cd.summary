@entity0 has never been one of the major characters in comic books , but @entity3 hopes that she will make a splash with her new look			1
the original @entity0 , @entity0 -- who , oddly enough , was created purely so @entity3 would have the rights to the name in 1977 -- has kept the same red and yellow costume for decades ( a new @entity0 wore a black costume , matching @entity12 's briefly in the 1980s )			1
now @entity3 is ready to update the character with a more modern looking outfit that includes a red and black jacket with yellow accents and tight black pants			1
it follows on the heels of @entity20 ' fashionable new take on @entity21 earlier this year ( like @entity22 , @entity20 is a @entity23 company )			1
that costume also included a jacket			2
artist @entity26 says that the idea for the design has been in the works since july			0
we 'll get our first look at the new @entity0 in the fifth issue come march			1
editor @entity33 told @entity34 , " @entity12 is n't really a detective -- he swings around looking for trouble , whereas @entity37 needs to go and figure stuff out and dig things up , and you ca n't really do that head to toe in spandex very well			0
" spider - woman quickly trended worldwide on @entity45 thursday morning after the new look was released , and fan reaction was mixed			0
" check out the functionality of @entity50 's new duds ! ! so cool ! now to figure out how to make that happen @entity54 , " said @entity52 's @entity51			0
" i just think @entity0 looked iconic , " @ @entity55 tweeted			2
" this costume isnt bad , at all - it reminds me of the @entity58 redesign tho			2
" " i like the new @entity0 costume a lot but not the glasses			1
i hate super hero costumes with glasses , " @ feemcbee said			0
@entity64 had a very good question : " new spider - woman costume is good , but she still has no pockets			0
where are heroes supposed to keep their stuff ? " what do you think of the new costume ? and take a look at more female superheroes in the gallery above .			0
