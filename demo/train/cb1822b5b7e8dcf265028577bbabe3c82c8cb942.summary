-- @entity2 's culture minister was feeling the heat wednesday after a weekend art exhibit in which she cut up a cake baked into the shape of a cartoonishly stereotyped @entity8 woman			1
a group representing @entity2 of @entity8 descent has called for @entity11 to resign over that it called a racist caricature			1
but @entity11 defended her participation , saying the cake was designed to " challenge the traditional image of racism			1
" " while the symbolism in the piece is despicable , it is unfortunate and highly regrettable that the presentation has been interpreted as an expression of racism by some , " @entity11 said in a statement issued by her office			2
" the artistic intent was the exact opposite			0
" the artist who designed the cake , @entity30 , is of @entity8 descent himself and said the piece was aimed at condemning the practice of female genital mutilation			1
pictures from the sunday exhibition showed @entity11 slicing into the cake from the " genitals " and feeding it to @entity39 , who told @entity0 he made himself the head of the figure and screamed in pain when it was cut			2
" i did n't intend for anyone to feel singled out or embarrassed , " he said			0
" but we 're talking about female genital mutilation -- is there any comfortable or cozy way to talk about it ? " @entity11 was scheduled to meet with representatives of the @entity51 - @entity2 , which has demanded she should step down , on wednesday evening			0
the group said it hoped to ensure " that similar events do n't happen again			0
" " to participate at a racist manifestation portrayed as art is definitely crossing the line , " @entity55 , the group 's spokesman , said in a written statement			2
he said the minister 's appearance shows she either supported what the group called a racist event " or that she has an extremely bad sense of questions of racism			1
" " no matter what , the @entity70 - @entity2 no longer have confidence for her as culture minister and demand that she assumes her responsibility and resigns , " @entity55 said			1
the event took place at @entity79 's @entity78 , which was marking @entity80 on sunday			0
