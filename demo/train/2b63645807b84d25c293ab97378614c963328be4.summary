@entity0 -- @entity3 frontman @entity2 poked fun at the @entity6 stars on monday ahead of the comedy troupe 's reunion concerts this week as " a bunch of wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth and make a load of money			1
" appearing in a video shown at the @entity15 ( mostly ) news conference at a central @entity0 theater , @entity2 is asked by his assistant if he wants tickets for the shows			1
the singer , who is watching the @entity23 football on tv with bandmate @entity25 , replies : " who wants to see that again ? it was funny in the 60s			2
" he adds : " the best one died years ago			2
maybe back in the 70s it was fantastic -- it was the funniest thing			2
we 've seen it all before			2
i mean they 've put it all up on @entity39			2
" @entity2 's assistant then runs through the playlist for the next @entity3 concert : " start with something everyone knows like ' @entity45 , ' then ' @entity46 , ' then hit ' satisfaction			1
' " his assistant then suggests : " @entity48			0
" to which , @entity2 replies , straight - faced : " yeah , ' @entity48			1
' " the five surviving members of @entity6 -- @entity51 died in 1989 -- will perform together live for the first time since 1980 this week , putting on 10 shows at the @entity54 in southeast @entity0			1
the first shows sold out in a matter of minutes when they were announced last november , and tickets for extra performances will go on sale on tuesday morning			0
the comedians say the extravagantly choreographed performances will be their last			0
the very last show , on july 20 , will be broadcast live in more than 2,000 cinemas around the world , and on tv			1
at monday 's news conference , however , the stars -- all now in their 70s -- joked that they would reform every 33 years			1
python member @entity71 , who is directing the shows , said they would perform many of of their best - known sketches such as the " @entity75 , " " @entity48 " and " the " @entity76 , " as well as new material			1
" our motto has been ' leave them wanting less , ' " he joked			0
echoing @entity2 's comments in the preceding film clip , @entity71 agreed there were similarities between pop bands reforming and themselves			1
" ( the fans ) want to hear ' @entity45 , ' " @entity71 said			0
" so it would be folly to try to write better things than our best old work			0
" @entity92 said the final live shows were taking place in @entity95 , " where it started , " and is part of " saying goodbye publicly " to fans			1
@entity71 added that , the day before the run opens , there was a " weight of expectation " on their shoulders			0
the @entity104 admitted they had reunited mainly for the money , but said they were enjoying working together again			0
and with " nothing more to be done " to prepare for the shows , the mood now was one of excitement , he added			0
@entity71 , @entity51 , @entity92 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 became comedic legends with the creation of @entity116 in october 1969			0
they produced 45 tv episodes for the @entity119 and five films together before going their separate ways in 1983			0
the shows mostly consisted of a string of often incoherent sketches , only occasionally with conventional punchlines and loosely tied together by @entity111 's stream - of - consciousness animations			1
although the tv show ran for only four seasons , it proved a massive cult hit when it was shown in the @entity132 beginning in 1974 -- just as the show was winding up on the other side of the @entity135 .			0
