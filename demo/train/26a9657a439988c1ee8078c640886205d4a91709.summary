@entity0 -- the body of @entity5 , a veteran correspondent for @entity6 of @entity7 who was killed in a shelling attack in the @entity11 city of @entity12 , will likely be buried inside @entity11 , her mother said saturday			1
@entity13 said aid workers , who have been trying for days to remove her daughter 's body from the war - ravaged country , tried again saturday but ultimately determined that the situation was too dangerous			1
" we were told yesterday that today was probably the last day , " the elder @entity20 said			1
she added that she believes her daughter was deliberately targeted by @entity11 government forces			1
the younger @entity20 , 56 , a @entity0 native who was the only @entity25 newspaper journalist inside the @entity12 neighborhood of @entity12 , was killed alongside @entity28 journalist @entity27 in a bombing attack earlier this week			2
" they were first in another house , and the top floors there were blown off , " the elder @entity20 said			2
" @entity38 ( the @entity11 forces ) rocketed the front of the building , " she said , fueling suspicion that the attack against a makeshift media center where @entity20 and @entity27 were holed up was no accident			2
the @entity11 government was not immediately available for comment			0
the day before she was killed , @entity20 had given media interviews to networks like @entity46 and @entity1 about the ongoing clashes in @entity12 , and about a child who was killed in the city			2
" the baby 's death was just heartbreaking , " she told @entity1 's @entity51			2
" we just watched this little boy , his little tummy , heaving and heaving as he tried to breathe			0
" @entity20 reported tuesday that there was " constant shelling in the city " and that the child 's death was " just one of many stories " in violence - wracked @entity12			1
" it 's chaos here			0
" journalists and activists have been sneaking into @entity11 in an effort to report on the protests and clashes that have persistently challenged the authority of president @entity75			0
@entity20 said graphic images like that of the dying child , who was reportedly struck in the chest by a piece of shrapnel , needed to be shown			0
" something like that i think is actually stronger for an audience , for someone who 's not here , for an audience for which the conflict , any conflict , is very far away			0
but that 's the reality , " she said			0
the siege of @entity12 , where 28,000 civilians are " hiding , being shelled , defenseless , " @entity20 reported , has become a flashpoint of the country 's bloody year of violence			1
" that baby probably will move more people to think , ' what is going on and why is no one stopping this murder in @entity12 that is happening everyday ? ' " " there are no military targets here , " @entity20 reported , refuting @entity11 claims that its forces are only hunting terrorists			0
" it 's a complete and utter lie , " she said of the government 's response			0
" the @entity109 is basically shelling a city of cold , starving civilians			0
" a day later , @entity20 and @entity27 were killed			0
@entity20 , a @entity113 graduate renown for reporting on war 's more human consequences , had for years worked in conflict zones and high risk areas , despite losing an eye in 2001 during a grenade attack in @entity120			1
since her death , her family has started a fund in her honor			1
" we felt we had to do something so there was a place that people could donate , " said family member @entity20			1
the @entity5 fund is intended to direct resources to support charities that her family says she would have supported .			1
