-- aaaand ... take 2 ! not one to give up , director @entity1 has filed an amended lawsuit against the gossip website @entity4 for linking to the leaked screenplay for his next movie , " @entity7			1
" last month , a federal judge dismissed his original suit , ruling that @entity1 had failed to prove that @entity4 's actions was direct copyright infringement			1
the judge , @entity12 of the @entity13 of @entity14 , then gave @entity1 's lawyers until thursday to refile			1
and so , they did			0
and they 're seeking more than $ 1 million			1
@entity1 's lawyers are arguing that @entity4 encouraged a reader to ' leak ' a copy of the screenplay , downloaded it , and then made it available to the public by linking to it			1
" @entity4 has made a business of predatory journalism , violating people 's rights to make a buck , " the amended lawsuit says			1
" this time they went too far			2
" how it all began " @entity34 " is a @entity32 that @entity1 said he was hoping to take on as his next project			2
it 's in the same genre as his 2012 hit " @entity42 , " a movie that won him an @entity39 for writing and a @entity40 for best screenplay			0
he told the gossip site deadline that he 'd given the script to only six people , including actors @entity46 , best known as the killer in @entity1 's " @entity49 ; " and @entity50 , for whom " @entity49 " was his breakthrough role			2
somehow , the script leaked			0
it was posted through a site that lets users anonymously upload and download files			0
in january , @entity4 linked to the website hosting the script			2
" here is the leaked @entity62 , " the headline on the story read			0
although @entity4 did n't post the script to its own site , @entity1 's lawyers charged the script would n't have been widely accessible if @entity4 had n't linked to it			1
" rather than merely publishing a news story reporting that plaintiff 's screenplay may have been circulating within certain limited @entity71 circles without his permission , @entity4 crossed the journalistic line , first by requesting that a reader ' leak ' an infringing copy directly to @entity4 , then second , after obtaining a link to and itself directly downloading an infringing @entity80 copy , and then third , by promoting itself to the public as the first source to download and read the entire screenplay illegally and directing the public to do so			2
what happened next @entity4 responded saying @entity1 's suit was without merit			1
it was n't guilty of actual copyright infringement			0
on april 22 , he threw out the original suit , saying @entity1 's lawyers had failed to prove " direct infringement			1
" now , comes the amended suit			0
@entity1 's lawyers are claiming both direct and contributory infringement			2
what 's happening now the question before the judge now is this : does a site that downloads copyrighted material violate the rights of an author ? whether the " @entity34 " project is indeed scrapped is unclear			0
last last month , @entity1 held a three - hour reading of the script and told audience members he was working on changes to it			1
he said making the film is still possible			0
for now , though , there 's the lawsuit to contend with			0
lights , camera , ( legal ) action ! @entity0 's @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 contributed to this report .			0

last month , a federal judge dismissed his original suit
