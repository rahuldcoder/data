@entity1 , @entity0 -- believe the conspiracy theories : out of sight and without your knowledge , governments truly are filtering what you see on the @entity10			1
internet users are increasingly having content blocked by governments around the world			1
the recent conflict between @entity16 and @entity17 has highlighted many of the issues at play with internet filtering , as its increasing use by governments raises serious doubts about the freedom of the @entity26			1
@entity16 authorities blocked most access to @entity17 news broadcasters and web sites after the outbreak of the conflict , and both sides reported web sites being blocked , removed or attacked as the situation unfolded			1
according to one of @entity2 's ireporters in @entity16 , the situation has been very frightening for citizens			1
@entity40 said an online forum he used to organize supporters appeared to have been taken down , and he described a " cyberwar " in which some web sites appear to be blocked			2
" please , please help us			0
we are losing our treasure , our freedom			0
i am almost crying because i 'm seeing my country is falling , " @entity40 said			0
so , what is internet filtering , and why all the fuss ? filtering simply means restricting access , blocking or taking down web sites			1
@entity55 , senior researcher at freedom promoter @entity56 , said there were several ways in which content could be " filtered			0
" she said governments could use purpose - built filtering technology , censor web sites , filter search results -- with the assistance of multinational corporations , and block applications and circumvention tools -- to stop online applications like @entity70 , @entity71 or @entity72 that enable social networking			1
and the use of these tactics appears to be quite widespread			0
according to a 2007 report by the @entity79 , which surveyed more than 40 countries , almost two - thirds of the states involved were filtering content to some degree			1
@entity83 , director of the @entity84 at the @entity85 at the @entity86 , said in the research , " states are applying ever more fine grained methods to limit and shape the information environment to which their citizens have access			0
" " some states block access to a wide swathe of content , while others tend to concentrate on one or two narrow baskets			1
@entity100 , for example , tends to block access only to sites related to @entity103 , " @entity83 said			2
although countries such as @entity106 and @entity107 -- home to the " @entity109 " -- are obvious examples of where filtering is prevalent , other countries are also restricting content for varying reasons			1
@entity115 , research fellow at the @entity116 , said the internet in some @entity119 countries , including the @entity120 , was also filtered			2
however , this was mostly to block child pornography and content that incited or glorified terrorism , he said			0
most democracies , and particularly those of the @entity127 and @entity128 , had unrestricted @entity10 , though more than 40 countries were known to filter content , he said			1
and it 's not just governments involved in filtering			2
search engine @entity134 has been heavily criticized for working with the @entity107 government to block searches for material about @entity138 , @entity139 , democracy and other sensitive issues on its @entity107 portal			0
share your views on filtering and censorship of web sites			2
with recent developments in @entity16 and internet restrictions during conflict in @entity152 last year , there are concerns that filtering could be further utilized in future " cyberwarfare			1
" @entity115 believed that filtering would be used more commonly in repressive states in the future			0
although he did n't have exact figures , @entity115 understood the @entity107 military had more than 100,000 people employed to look at cyber warfare			0
@entity162 , co-founder of @entity164 's @entity163 , said the tactic was very powerful			0
" filtering can help shape the message a country 's citizens see , including , as may have happened recently when @entity16 filtered some @entity17 web sites , for the purpose of preventing enemy propaganda from reaching one 's citizens			1
" although @entity55 agreed that filtering was a strong aspect to cyber warfare , she said other trends were more concerning			0
" filtering is n't the primary technological way that internet freedom can be compromised			2
the kind of ' cyberwarfare ' that we hear about usually is n't filtering as much as ' denial of service ' attacks that disable servers hosting particular web sites , either of opposition media outlets or of foreign governments			1
" another type of ' cyberwarfare ' that occurs more regularly is hacking into computers and stealing information , as well as planting @entity195 or viruses , " @entity55 said			0
so , if governments are stepping up their internet filtering and the threat of cyberwarfare is increasing , how can citizens sidestep the restrictions ? @entity162 said tech - savvy citizens are using a variety of tools to circumvent filtering			1
" they range from the @entity207 's @entity206 to commercial anonymizers and virtual private networks and ' buddy system ' software like @entity212 , which allows a person in one place to handle requests for web sites from someone in a place that filters			0
" in @entity106 , some citizens were overcoming @entity10 restrictions by using @entity56 's @entity222 web site			2
@entity55 said the site offered news and debates with a plurality of voices and gave @entity106 an opportunity to participate			0
the domain name was changed weekly to keep ahead of @entity106 authorities , she said			0
@entity162 , a founder of the @entity79 , which tracks internet filtering around the world , said the organization is working on a free tool that will let people easily report blockages as they find them			1
he believed that such tools could help citizens in heavily restricted countries bypass filters placed by their governments .			2
