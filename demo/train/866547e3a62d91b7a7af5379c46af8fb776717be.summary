-- for sportsmen to form a pop group is rare , for a boy band to be forged from a sport often criticized as being the stuffy reserve of boring old men is something of a miracle			0
not that the chances of future platinum - selling albums or world tours look particularly good for " @entity12 , " if the standard of their first release " oh , oh , oh " is anything to go by			1
awkward dance moves , dubious costumes and with voices as thin as a sheet of paper ; the foursome of @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are hardly @entity26			1
but the band -- who were created by world - ranked 44 @entity29 -- will not be disappointed if they fail to top the billboard charts because the quartet of @entity34 players are singing and dancing for charity			1
the group 's debut track -- which is a throwback to the 1990s boy band heyday of @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 -- has so far proved an internet sensation attracting over a million views on @entity44 since it went live on june 13			0
in fact , three - times @entity34 winner @entity22 , who was the driving force behind @entity12 , has built a cult social media following over the last 12 months after uploading a host of comedy clips of himself			1
in one the 35 - year - old took time to make fun of his reputation as a slow player -- prompting the @entity34 website to suggest he 'd been transformed from the , " sultan of slow , to the lord of laughs			1
" " my image , amongst some of the golfers , is slow golfer , nice guy , " @entity22 told the @entity34			1
" so when friends go from slow golfer , nice guy to ' wow , ' it 's like the perfect storm of my image to the videos , it 's such a contrast			0
it 's had more effect because of it			0
" and @entity22 's latest production was designed to take things to the next level			1
after securing funding from @entity79 , @entity22 convinced @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 to make it happen			1
" we 've got costumes , a studio rented and we 're going for it			0
the boy band is coming back , " he proudly stated in may			0
@entity79 came on board through their involvement with @entity22 , a player they sponsor and who won the @entity34 tournament they host in @entity91 last year			1
" the proceeds will benefit charitable organizations designated by @entity95 and @entity22 , " said company vice president @entity92			1
the timing of @entity12 ' debut release , during the 111th @entity98 at @entity99 in @entity100 , only added to the hype			1
when the golfing world should be occupied with finding its next major champion , many will be talking about the @entity12 ' video -- and in particular the players ' ridiculous outfits			2
@entity23 is shirtless in a pair of denim dungarees ; @entity25 in skin - tight leopard print pants and an open fur coat			1
@entity22 sports what looks like a cut - off wetsuit , while @entity24 is resplendent in leather pants and an open leather jacket			1
the video opens with the foursome in staged boy band pose , before the camera pans in on each of their faces in slow motion			0
then the choreographed dancing kicks in , with the players mixing studio moves with coordinated routines on the golf course			0
by the time the golf - themed lyrics kick in you begin to wonder how the players managed to keep a straight face long enough to film it			0
" @entity133 , putt , you know , what 's the big whoop ? when i play my game , then i make my mama proud , " sings @entity25			2
" smash , bang , you got to hit the ball far			0
when the crowd goes ooooh , then you hear the oo - da - la - li - la - li , " continues @entity24			2
@entity24 's involvement is particularly amusing when you consider his status as @entity149 's pop star golfer elect			2
the 22 - year - old has been labeled " the @entity156 brother of golf " , on account of his boy - band good looks , and he attracts hoards of admiring fans wherever he goes			0
quite what his role in @entity12 will do to his appeal remains to be seen			2
while @entity22 's collective are clearly the first @entity34 boy band , @entity12 are n't the first professional golfers to try their hands at music			1
two - times major winner @entity166 has been known to pick up a guitar and sing on occasion , and has even written his own material			0
it 's surely only a matter of time before @entity12 invite him along for a cameo			2
" @entity22 has talked about the potential of future videos , " admitted @entity92			2
and with that , it 's off to watch his latest clip - " the making of @entity12 "			0
oo - da - la - li - la - li .			0

the " @entity12 " release their first single " oh , oh , oh " to *coincide* with the @entity98
@entity34 pros @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 complete the line up
project was funded by @entity79 with all proceeds going to charity
