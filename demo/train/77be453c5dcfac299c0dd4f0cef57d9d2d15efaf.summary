the first thing you notice is the smell : rich , deep , and mysterious			0
and somehow , both fresh and musty at the same time			0
it 's a scent that immediately piques your curiosity			1
@entity7 's @entity6 team visited @entity9 's oldest whisky distillery just outside @entity10 to learn more about a spirit that 's just been named the best in the world			1
just a few weeks ago , the @entity14 2013 , made by beverage giant @entity15 , took home top honors in @entity19 's " @entity18 "			1
the whisky guru referred to it as " near indescribable genius			1
" @entity23 did n't even make the top three			0
while @entity9 whisky has been taking home awards for over a decade , this was a first			1
and standing in the cellar piled high with oak casks , some @entity30 , some @entity31 , and some @entity9 , you get the sense that its rise around the globe has only just begun			1
do n't call it scotch @entity15 's chief blender @entity38 is responsible for every bottle of whisky -- do n't call it @entity23 , he says -- that leaves the 90 - year - old distillery			1
while the @entity43 - trained @entity38 is modest about taking home the top title , he is clearly proud of what @entity9 whisky has achieved			1
the secret , he says , is not boldness , but balance			0
perhaps it 's the purity of the water , which @entity51 says makes a gentle spirit			2
or maybe it 's because the whisky is exposed to @entity9 's dry , cold winters and hot , humid summers as it matures inside those casks			1
or maybe it 's about the blending			2
" the scotch industry has more than 100 distilleries there , so blenders can choose from each distillery , " @entity51 points out			1
" but we have only two malt distilleries , one grain distillery			2
that 's why we have to make different types of whisky even in one distillery			1
" creating a perfect blend @entity15 's blender wo n't show us the secret behind his craft , but when we ask him how he maintains the quality he gives us a glimpse into the science			2
formulas of the most popular labels can change up to two dozen times a year , @entity51 says , because no two casks are exactly the same			0
change one ingredient in the blend and that precious balance is no more			0
it 's a challenge that seems even more daunting when we learn some products use 15 or 20 different types of whisky			1
even single malt contains whisky from about ten casks , he says , although all from a single distillery to qualify for the single - malt moniker			2
a matter of taste from blending , we 're on to tasting			0
if you like your whisky neat , well , here 's the first big surprise with @entity9 whisky : add water			1
even if it 's just a dash			2
@entity51 says adding water is a must in order to release the aromas and savor the full flavors			0
that 's because most @entity9 enjoy drinking whisky with a meal , sometimes on the rocks , sometimes in a highball glass with soda			1
so once in the glass , the whisky has to hold its character and flavor , even while the proof begins to drop			2
@entity51 confesses he drinks it straight , but definitely not without a drop or two of water to open it up			0
as for that best - in - the - world whisky ? you ca n't get it in @entity9 , @entity51 says			1
only 3,000 bottles were released , and they were all exported			0
whisky culture while @entity9 whisky is making headlines , whisky culture in the country is distinctly low - key			1
many whisky bars are small with only a dozen or so seats and a solitary bartender			2
@entity141 , the cocktail designer at the @entity142 , gives us a first - hand look at @entity9 whisky bar - tending skills			1
@entity141 's nickname is " mr. @entity151 , " and we soon learn why when he sets to work transforming a rough , softball - sized block of ice into a smooth sphere			2
fragments fly in every direction as @entity141 chips away , before he spins his handiwork into a lowball glass , pours single malt whisky over the top and then carefully lifts the cube twice with a spoon to release the aromas			2
" @entity9 whisky has a good balance , " @entity141 says			1
" compared with scotch whisky , it does not lose the taste and flavor when you mix it with other drinks			1
it is easy to use as a cocktail base			0
" so we ask for an @entity171			0
and he just looks at us			0
a different bartender might raise an eyebrow , but @entity141 is far too polite			0
which @entity9 whisky would be best for that , we ask			1
the answer , it turns out , is none			0
according to @entity141 , mixing the spirits with anything but ice , water or soda , would ruin its purity and balance			0
but he says of course he 'll make one if the customer really wants it			0
we 've learned our lesson			0
another 12 - year @entity191 on the " rock , " please			0
it 's time to relax and enjoy			0
@entity7 's @entity194 & @entity195 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity14 2013 topped @entity19 's " @entity202 "
