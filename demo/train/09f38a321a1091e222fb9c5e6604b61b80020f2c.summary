@entity0 -- it should come as no surprise that prominent union leaders are among the first group president @entity6 courts as he seeks support for overhauling immigration policy			1
it was organized labor that helped ensure defeat of a bipartisan effort to reform the nation 's immigration laws five years ago			1
at that time , the @entity15 and other prominent union groups came out against the initiative , fearing a proposal for a temporary guest worker program for seasonal workers would weaken union membership and bargaining clout			1
that led to a handful of liberal - leaning @entity25 to vote against the bill , including sens. @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
mindful that a potential split in the @entity25 coalition this time around could again prove fatal to the passage of an immigration bill , @entity6 met on tuesday with more than a dozen labor leaders			1
they included @entity15 president @entity36 , @entity37 of the @entity38 , and @entity39 of @entity40			1
@entity41 : five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform the purpose of the hour - long , closed - door meeting was to engage in a " dialogue " about " immigration reform and how it fits into his broader economic agenda , " the @entity45 said			1
in comments to reporters following the meeting , there was evidence the president had sought to ensure that the union leaders were in his corner before he unveils an immigration proposal			2
" it was an excellent conversation , " @entity36 said outside the @entity45			0
" i think we are all on the same page			0
" the @entity45 has long been hopeful that the labor movement get on board			0
despite a contentious relationship at times with labor , the president 's agenda has largely been supported by the major union leaders			2
@entity36 also notably attended @entity6 's immigration speech last week in @entity73			2
nonetheless , the same sticking points that turned labor against immigration reform five years ago remain			1
' now 's the time ' to move on immigration , @entity6 says conservatives , including @entity81 sen. @entity80 , are again pushing a temporary guest worker program that is favored by the business community and agricultural interests that depend on seasonal employment			1
but the major unions remain opposed to such a measure			0
in 2009 , both the @entity15 and the @entity38 jointly released guidelines on an immigration reform package they would support			1
those guidelines called for " improvement , not expansion " of temporary worker programs			2
@entity6 has so far not mentioned a guest worker program in his broad outlines of an immigration reform plan			1
the burden of attaining citizenship is another trip wire			0
both the @entity15 and @entity38 are lobbying for an easier path to citizenship than was proposed by the 2007 effort			1
that is in part because union membership has declined significantly over the past two decades along with contraction of @entity109 manufacturing			0
a surge of new citizens , many of whom will seek unionized jobs , could boost their numbers			0
" we were talking about trying to fix a broken system , " @entity36 said after the @entity45 meeting			0
" we were talking about commonsense reform that has an inclusive and broad path to citizenship that allows us to bring people in and take advantage of that			2
" @entity109 's brain drain dilemma : immigrant students who leave @entity36 declined to specify the kind of path to citizenship the president suggested he would support			0
another leader said she thought there was agreement between the labor groups and @entity6			2
" there was joint agreement by everybody in this room and the president that there must be a pathway to citizenship and it must be meaningful and real , " said @entity134 of the @entity135 , also a participant in the meeting			0
" it 's our job to get the kind of solution that will reflect that meaningful path			0
