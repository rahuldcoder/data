lawyers for suspected @entity2 bomber @entity1 have asked a federal court to strike comments he made at a hospital after suffering wounds during a manhunt that paralyzed the city in the days following the 2013 race			1
in a motion filed wednesday , they asserted that authorities repeatedly questioned @entity1 , 20 , as he begged for rest and requested a lawyer at least 10 times			1
defense attorneys said @entity1 was groggy and under the influence of several pain medications after undergoing emergency surgery when @entity21 agents began questioning him hours after his capture on april 19			2
@entity1 had suffered several gunshot wounds , including one to the head , according to the motion			0
his left eye was sutured shut , his jaw was wired closed and he was unable to hear out of his left ear			0
he was unable to speak after undergoing a tracheotomy , according to the motion			0
unable to respond verbally , @entity1 wrote answers to interrogators ' questions in a notebook , where his attorneys said he scribbled the word " lawyer " 10 times			1
the motion said other notes showed that he also wrote : " can we do this later ? " " i 'm exhausted , " and " you said you were gon na let me sleep			0
" defense lawyers claimed that any comments @entity1 made during these interrogations -- which went on intermittently for hours at the hospital -- should be inadmissible in court because they were not given voluntarily			1
government officials have indicated that @entity1 was questioned under what is called the " public safety " exception to the @entity51 warnings , which allows for limited questioning by law enforcement of a suspect to determine if there is imminent danger to the public of an attack			2
but defense lawyers said @entity1 told police after being captured that he had discarded his gun and where it could be found			0
@entity1 is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race , along with his brother @entity66 , who was killed during the manhunt			1
his trial is set for early november , with the government seeking the death penalty			1
defense lawyers are expected to argue the younger @entity1 was under the " domination and control " of his brother			0
in a separate motion on wednesday , the defense asked the court to declare the death penalty unconstitutional , calling the practice " cruel and unusual			1
" the defense listed several objections to the @entity82 , including " public and worldwide revulsion over the recurring spectacle of botched executions			0
" lawyers specifically pointed to the case of @entity88 , a convicted murderer who died in april of an apparent heart attack almost 45 minutes after his execution began at @entity91			0
authorities said one of his veins collapsed during the administration of a previously unused combination of lethal injection drugs			0
defense lawyers also argued the federal government 's authority to impose the death penalty should be limited because it is illegal in @entity104 , where @entity1 's trial is scheduled			1
in seeking the death penalty , prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor @entity1 's " betrayal of the @entity109			1
" they claim that after receiving asylum from the @entity109 , he " enjoyed the freedoms of a @entity109 citizen ; and then betrayed his allegiance to the @entity109 " by killing and maiming its people			0
defense attorneys also requested in a separate motion that prosecutors turn over instructions given to the grand jury that indicted @entity1			2
the lawyers hope to determine whether jurors knew that some findings would be used in the prosecution 's pursuit of the death penalty			1
they argued that this point is particularly significant because the jury was made up of @entity104 citizens			0
the state banned the death penalty in 1984			2
at the time the grand jury was considering its indictment , prosecutors had not publicly revealed their intention to seek the death penalty .			2
