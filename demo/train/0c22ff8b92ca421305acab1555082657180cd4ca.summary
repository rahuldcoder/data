@entity0 -- former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 has survived political , corruption and sex scandals over the years , but on friday , a @entity7 court sentenced the flamboyant politician to four years in prison for tax evasion			1
@entity2 , who is likely to appeal , called it an " unacceptable political sentence " in an interview that aired on @entity1 affiliate @entity14			1
" i was convinced that i would get acquitted of an accusation that is far from the truth , " he said			0
" this is a conviction i can easily define as political , incredible and even intolerable			2
" he added : " i 'm a victim of judicial harassment			0
" his trial , which also involved executives from @entity2 's @entity22 television group and the head of a @entity25 bank , concerned the purchase of tv rights for films that were then resold within the group at inflated prices			1
prosecutors said the scheme , involving about 3,000 @entity34 films , allowed those involved to avoid a major tax bill			0
they may have to pay a fine of up to â ‚ ¬ 10 million ( $ 12.9 million ) if the court 's ruling is upheld			2
under the @entity3 legal system , @entity2 and his fellow defendants have the right to appeal their sentence twice , in the appeals court and a higher court			1
also , because the case dates to july 2006 , the statute of limitations will expire next year , meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time			0
@entity2 , 76 , resigned as prime minister in november amid his country 's debt crisis , bringing to an apparent end an 18 - year era in which he dominated @entity3 politics			1
through the years , he was accused of embezzlement , fraud and bribery , but he was never convicted until the tax evasion case			2
he also faces trial on charges that he hired an underage prostitute and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft			0
the woman involved in the long - running case is the @entity70 dancer @entity68 , nicknamed " @entity71 the @entity72 - stealer			0
" @entity34 movie star @entity73 had been expected to appear friday as a defense witness in that case but did not show up			0
the actor 's representative said he would not be serving as a witness for @entity2			1
