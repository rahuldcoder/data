since november , the @entity100 led anti-government protesters , who were mostly middle - class royalists , in calling for @entity93 's government to be replaced with an unelected " people 's council			0
" competing rallies were held by pro-government supporters , many of whom came from the country 's rural north and northeast and view @entity93 's ouster as a " judicial coup			0
