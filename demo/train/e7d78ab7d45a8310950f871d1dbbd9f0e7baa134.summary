-- director @entity2 's films often examine the close ties of love , passion and friendship , but his own relationship with his artist and filmmaker father is one that has informed much of his life and colored his work			1
@entity2 captures the pains and passions of relationships on the silver screen			1
as a 14 - year - old red guard during the @entity18 , @entity2 denounced his father for creating subversive art. while his father forgave him , @entity2 has found it hard to truly forgive himself			1
" i knew it was the wrong thing to do			0
if i did n't know , then i could 've forgiven myself , " he told @entity0			0
@entity2 has already touched upon such a significant moment in his personal life in his award - winning 1993 film , " @entity28			1
" it brought him international - acclaim and a host of accolades , including @entity34 's @entity33			2
like " @entity28 , " @entity2 's latest film , " @entity35 " ( " @entity36 " in @entity37 ) , once again delves into the world of @entity40 opera , and it has proven to be a hit in @entity42 since its release in cinemas in december			1
however , capturing the @entity18 remains one of @entity2 's ambitions -- not only to explore the circumstances that colored the relationship with his father but an exploration of a crucial time in @entity42 history			1
" it 's not because i was hurt and so many people hurt that i want to do my revenge			0
it 's not like this			0
this is the lesson that the @entity42 people must learn , no matter what , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" i hope that my generation of directors or writers could do something to tell people the truth , to tell people what really happened at that time ; why a young son of a film director , you know , could denounce his own father , like i did			2
i was still shocked , " he said			0
now 56 years old , @entity2 studied at the @entity73 , directing his first feature film " @entity75 " in 1984			2
after the success of " @entity28 , " he eventually took up the offer to direct a @entity79 film in 2002 -- " @entity80 , " with @entity81 and @entity82			1
while failing to impress the critics or register a hit at the box office , @entity2 remains sanguine about the experience			1
" i think i 've learnt a lot from that			0
although i fully understand why audiences did n't really enjoy that film that much			0
" in the industrial system [ of @entity79 ] people do n't really care if you 're making a good film or not			2
people care about whether the film can make money			0
it 's a completely different thing , you know			0
quite honestly , i was n't very comfortable to do films that way , " said @entity2			2
@entity2 will continue to make films in @entity42 and finds the country 's recent transformation as significant as earlier periods of change during his lifetime			1
" i ask myself whether it 's a progress or we 're just going back to where we not necessarily need to be			0
i mean , i 'm not trying to say anything politically			0
but i feel if you look at the very beginning of @entity116 ' novel , ' @entity117 , ' ' it was the best times , it was the worst times ... ' this is the simple answer , " he said			0
@entity121 will tell if today 's @entity42 will be part of @entity2 's cinematic sweep in the future .			1
