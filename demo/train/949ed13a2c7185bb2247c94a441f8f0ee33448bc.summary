" most people do n't have the experience			2
they go out and buy a new bike , take a course , buy the leathers and the getup and they 're instant bikers -- but it does n't work that way , " said @entity94 , who has attended @entity4 for many years			1
" nowadays , you got the lawyers and doctors or everybody is a biker			2
it used to be -- ' bikers ' who were here , " he said , wearing a jeans vest full of biker pins , a biker 's head wrap and a face shaven precisely to produce a white mustache and goatee			2
the really big show occurs along @entity127 in @entity0 , where people and bikes parade all day and night			0
folks from all walks of life can be found along the street shopping , people - watching or grabbing a beer from one of the self - described " beer girls " while listening to a live band cranking out a rock classic from the ' 80s			2
aging bikers covered with tattoos , before tattoos were part of pop culture , seem to have mellowed -- like one biker who walked down the street proudly carrying his teacup @entity149			0
most people come with a husband , wife , partner , parent , child or fellow biker			0
@entity157 and his 21 - year - old son pulled two bikes on a trailer from @entity161 to @entity29			1

but @entity177 said she realized once back at the hotel people are just the same as her family			0
@entity192 , 30 , who lives near @entity46 agrees there 's no reason to fear bikers			0
" if you get the chance to get and know the people , a lot of them are just regular people like you and me or doctors and lawyers but everyone is all around good people , " said @entity192 , who brought his 6 - year - old daughter with him because she loves to see all the bikes			0
" yeah , you do have the bad ones , but there 's more good than bad , " said @entity192			0
on the final weekend , the younger crowd comes into town for the big event , @entity29			1
the @entity213 season open takes place at the @entity46			0
when the sun goes down , bars become packed with happy , tipsy people			0
