-- you might expect sunday to be a day of rest in a predominantly @entity4 country like @entity5			1
but the @entity6 offers as good a reason as it gets to make an exception			2
there will be three contests -- in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 -- on what will be the fourth day of the prestigious football tournament			1
each of them pits a team from @entity19 against one from @entity20			0
here 's a look at a few things to watch for : spotlight on @entity24 @entity24 is one of a kind			1
at 26 years old , all he 's done is win four consecutive @entity26 , given annually to football 's best player			0
and he 's done it on one of the best club teams , @entity30 , in the world			0
but on the sport 's biggest stage , @entity24 has yet to deliver			1
on sunday , when his @entity35 team faces @entity36 , @entity24 will get another chance at a @entity6 title			1
many see this tournament as his best opportunity yet , given that he is in his prime and the event is being held in his native @entity44			0
@entity45 copes without @entity46 going into this year 's @entity6 , many tapped @entity45 as a favorite			1
the biggest reason : @entity50			0
he was the best player on the world 's best club team , @entity51 in 2013 -- when it won the @entity54 and even more prestigious @entity55			2
as such , there was good reason to think @entity50 could help lead his native @entity45 to the promised land			0
until , that is , the 31 - year - old was ruled out of the @entity6 due to back issues			2
so does that mean @entity45 is out of contention ? we might get a good gauge on that answer sunday , when @entity67 open @entity68 play with a matchup against @entity70			0
are you ready , @entity13 ? @entity13 is two years away from welcoming the world , as the host of the @entity74			1
what better way to warm up than with the @entity77 ' closest competition for the world 's biggest sporting event ? @entity6 play kicks off in @entity13 on sunday , with the @entity24 - led @entity35 squad facing off with @entity36			1
that means thousands of @entity83 ( a reference to @entity13 residents ) will pack into the iconic @entity87 stadium ; the even luckier ones , someone might argue , could be on the city 's world - famous beaches , like @entity92 and @entity93			1
whatever excitement there is sunday , though , should pale in comparison to what unfolds on sunday , july 13 , in the same stadium			0
that 's when the @entity6 final takes place			2
and -- if @entity5 ' prayers are answers -- the host team will be there , slugging it out for the championship			1
@entity20 teams are rolling @entity19 boasts being the birthplace of football			0
but this year , @entity20 has not only hosted the @entity6 , it 's virtually owned it -- with @entity5 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 having won their tournament openers			1
the only @entity118 team that did n't win was @entity119			0
that 's because it got beat by @entity114			0
plus , it can always take solace in the fact it won its last @entity6 in @entity5 , albeit 64 years ago			1
@entity20 teams will get three more chances to continue their run sunday : starting with @entity128 against @entity129 , then with @entity70 taking on @entity45 , and , lastly , with the @entity131 matchup			2
a new country , a real chance twenty - five years ago , @entity36 and @entity134 did n't exist			0
in the years after its 1991 declaration of independence from @entity139 , it was more or less a war zone			0
@entity141 came later in the 1990s , paved by the @entity142			0
and , with that , so did football -- including a fledgling national team that seemed to get better as the years went by			0
@entity36 narrowly missed out on a 2010 @entity6 berth			1
this time , it will try to get out of a group that includes @entity131 , @entity150 and @entity151			2
slated as 21st in the @entity26 world rankings -- just behind @entity111 and ahead of other @entity6 contenders like @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity128 -- @entity36 is looking to make history not just by showing up , but by advancing			1
as coach @entity157 said -- according to the broadcaster @entity161 , as reported by @entity163 : " we are not going to @entity5 simply as tourists or to take notes			2

@entity131 's @entity24 will take the field for the first time in @entity5
@entity36 will start play in its first @entity6
action starts in @entity13 -- host of the @entity6 finals , the @entity74
