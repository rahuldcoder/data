the @entity19 blog sprung to life on july 13 and was an instant hit			2
it is a collection of photos found on @entity11 that capture young wealthy people enjoying a life of minimally employed opulence : they 're on lavish vacations , taking the most expensive modes of transportation , showing off designer belongings and doing all manner of things with and to champagne			1
mixed in with the fun ( seriously , who would n't want to water - slide off a yacht ? ) are less creative attempts to brag , like sepia - shaded photos of exorbitant restaurant receipts			2
" a few glasses of wine and some misspelled @entity11 searches led to its creation , " the anonymous brains behind @entity42 of @entity11 , or @entity43 , told @entity44			1
many of the images featured on the @entity19 were tagged with keywords on @entity11 that made them easy to find , like # wealth , # mansion and # yacht			1

@entity62 fights crime with @entity11 while the reaction to the @entity19 has been largely one of disgust and anger -- " pretty sad how those @entity10 of @entity11 will never know the value of a hard days oh my god i hate them so much , " tweeted @entity72 -- some of the kids are enjoying the attention			1

" @entity85 's photos have been featured on @entity43 multiple times -- one shows him in front of a large yacht in the @entity94 and another is an image of a @entity99 gold - plated @entity97			1
( he does not own the gun ; he just snapped a photo of it in an @entity104 boutique			0
) the public 's fascination with these kids has not gone unnoticed by @entity108 , where wealthy personalities are a huge draw on shows like " keeping up with the @entity112 " and the " @entity114 " series			1
naturally , a reality tv casting agent has been reaching out to many of the blog 's subjects			1
" they seem to have huge personalities and would be amazing on tv , " said @entity119 , a casting agent who has worked on hits like " @entity121 " and @entity123 's " @entity122			2

this is very embarrassing , " @entity150 told " @entity152			0

she has not deleted the public photo from her @entity11			1
@entity161 , daughter of @entity161 ceo @entity163 , had her social media presence quickly scrubbed from the internet after a photo of her brother on a private plane to @entity169 , feasting on a spread of fruit 3 - feet deep , made it to the @entity43 blog			2
@entity174 dug into a @entity161 regulatory filing and reported that the @entity161 family pays approximately $ 2.7 million a year for personal security			0
between her active @entity11 and @entity179 accounts , @entity161 was leaving a trail of information , including locations and timing of trips , that could have been used by kidnappers or burglars			1
