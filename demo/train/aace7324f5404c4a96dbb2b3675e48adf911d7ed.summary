@entity0 -- months after announcing the reintroduction of the low - cost @entity4 brand -- to be assembled in @entity5 -- @entity6 on tuesday moved its global headquarters for its luxury @entity9 line to @entity0 to be closer to the red - hot @entity12 luxury market			1
the common denominator between both moves : building production and customer base outside the @entity18 market , as export - driven companies have been hammered by the high value of the yen			2
@entity6 produces about 20 % of its cars in @entity18 , but ceo @entity23 would like to see that reduced			1
" we 're going to continue to do that ( offshore production ) , obviously , because how can you compete with the yen at 80 yen to the dollar when the historic level has been 110 ( yen to the dollar ) ? " @entity23 told @entity1 's @entity33			1
" we can not compete against @entity35 makes or other competitors			0
" the yen hit record high of 75.93 yen to the @entity39 dollar in october and remains stubbornly strong , hovering around the 79.45 yen to the dollar this week			2
" i 'm still not happy because of the strength of the yen			0
the strength of the yen is a penalty for @entity18 , " @entity23 said			1
" i do n't think it 's so much a penalty for companies , because large companies have the possibility to off - shore production			0
" despite the ongoing travails in @entity52 , @entity23 predicts 2012 will be a record year for the automotive industry			0
" last year the industry produced and sold about 76 million cars -- we are on a trend this year to sell 79 million , " he said			0
" i think in 2012 we 're going to have a recession in @entity52 , that 's obvious , " he added			0
" yes , @entity52 is going to be a problem ... but @entity18 's going to be better than last year , " @entity23 said , as the world 's third largest economy recovers from the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami , and the subsequent energy problems , as the nation 's nuclear plants went off line following the @entity68 nuclear disaster			2
" the @entity39 is in recovery more ( and will sell ) 1 million additional cars compared to last year , " @entity23 said			0
" @entity12 , even though the growth has slowed down , there is still growth -- 5 % to 6 % growth of 17 million or 18 million cars sold there is still an additional million cars worth of growth			0
" @entity82 is growing well , @entity81 is growing well , @entity80 is growing well , the @entity83 is coming back , " he added			0
the move of @entity9 's headquarters to @entity12 is designed to help @entity6 capture the luxury car market , a segment which has seen " 20 % to 25 % growth on a yearly basis , " @entity23 said			1
@entity6 announced earlier this year the return of the @entity4 brand after 30 years			1
the company plans to introduce the low - cost car in several emerging markets in 2014			1
the @entity4 brand first emerged in @entity18 in 1923 but was phased out in the 1980s as the company focused on mid-market buyers and its upscale @entity9 brand , launched in 1989			1
the company also plans to invest $ 400 million in @entity5 production , adding 3,300 jobs and producing 250,000 vehicles by 2014 .			2

@entity6 moved its global headquarters for its luxury @entity9 line to @entity0
comes after the company announced plans to *relaunch* the @entity4 brand for emerging markets
ceo @entity23 said the company will continue to offshore production outside of @entity18
