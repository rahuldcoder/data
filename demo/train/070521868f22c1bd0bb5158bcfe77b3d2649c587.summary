unless you 've been stuck in a mine shaft or visiting a distant planet for the past few decades , chances are you 've heard of @entity5 and @entity6 and can identify both as the most famous sons of @entity10 soil			2
beyond reggae and track icons , however , there are many fascinating things less widely known about " jamrock " that make this island of just 3 million people stand out			2
here are eight things to know for starters : @entity20 's birthplace @entity21 conjured up and penned the thrilling international spy novels known the world over by their larger - than - life , women - and evildoer - conquering protagonist , @entity20 , in @entity26 , a sleepy village in the parish of @entity29 on @entity31 's north coast			1
@entity21 named his rustic property goldeneye after a @entity35 operation in which he 'd taken part as an intelligence officer			1
an avid birder , @entity21 took 007 's name from the @entity41 author of " @entity42			1
" travel photos we wish we 'd taken the first @entity20 film , " @entity46 , " was filmed in @entity31 , where the villain 's lair , actually a bauxite storage facility owned by @entity50 , is hard to miss in @entity51			1
and later in the film , @entity52 walked out of the surf and into movie history at one of @entity31 's most spectacular beaches , @entity57 , located just west of @entity58 , where cool river water cascades directly into the warm @entity61 sea			1
after @entity21 's death , his @entity63 property was sold to @entity66 founder @entity65 , who has transformed it into @entity31 's most exclusive boutique hotel and villa resort			1
10 things you did n't know about @entity72 roots of banana trade and @entity61 tourism @entity31 gave birth to the global banana trade and @entity61 tourism			1
in the late 1800s , steamships began plying routes between the @entity80 and the parishes of @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity29 in northeast @entity31			1
when these steamships began carrying passengers seeking relief from the @entity87 winter on the southbound journey , @entity61 tourism was born			2
steamship captain @entity89 was a pioneer in the banana trade and served as president of the @entity93 , which later became @entity94 through a merger and more recently became @entity96			2
the banana industry waned in @entity31 in the face of crop disease and larger , more competitive plantations established in @entity101			1
today the island 's largest banana grower is @entity104 , a locally held company that targets domestic and international markets with a range of agricultural products			0
delicious coffee @entity109 is among the most prized , and expensive , in the world , fetching upwards of @entity41 $ 30 a pound			0
high elevation cloud forests make for an ideal long growing season and slow maturation period for coffee berries , ultimately yielding beans with a strong , full - bodied flavor void of the bitterness typical of coffee grown in other regions			2
@entity123 coffee connoisseurs are the leading buyers of @entity109 , which is a registered international trademark like @entity125 , and regulated by @entity31 's @entity126			1
one of the best ways to learn about and taste @entity31 's coffee is with a farm or factory tour			1
the @entity133 family 's @entity131 is an excellent option , offering visitors a trip back in time to the days of small - scale cottage industry production			0
the @entity139 family operates the neighboring @entity141 coffee farm with a slightly larger scale , more industrialized business			0
the buzzing factory buys its beans from thousands of farmers and is the largest industrial coffee processing and roasting operation in the @entity151 that opens its doors to visitors			0
10 things to know before visiting @entity156 few @entity157 while locked hair might be the most famous " do " associated with the island , @entity10 adherents to the rastafarian movement make up less than 2 % of the population , actually just 1.1 % , according to the @entity163			1
the iconic natural hairstyles associated with @entity157 are anything but the norm on the island , where instead , chemically treated straightened hair , extensions , weaves and wigs are the norm for women , and most men rock short - cropped coifs			1
a refuge for exiled @entity177 and religious diversity @entity31 became a refuge for exiled @entity177 fleeing the @entity180			1
the @entity182 crown , which ruled the island between 1492 and 1655 , took a more relaxed stance on religious freedom , or at least a " do n't ask , do n't tell " approach			0
@entity188 's active synagogue attests to the island 's small , yet prominent , jewish community today			0
today @entity31 has more churches per capita than any other country			1
the @entity193 played a significant role during the slave period in maintaining order on the island and quelling discontent , while the @entity200 , on the other hand , fueled slave uprisings ultimately leading to emancipation in 1834			0
it would be difficult to find a religion not represented in @entity31 , and where a church structure does n't exist , @entity10 are inclined to erect a tent for pop - up service			1
pentecostals , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 are all well represented , among numerous other faiths and denominations			0
marijuana is illegal in @entity31 despite the ubiquitous posters of @entity5 and @entity223 with burning joints dangling from their mouths , marijuana is still illegal in @entity31			1
but its legal status is slowly evolving			0
this year legislation was introduced to decriminalize marijuana use and develop a regulated medical and recreational marijuana industry following similar @entity41 initiatives in @entity231 and @entity232			2
the movement to decriminalize has been led in the political sphere by minister of justice @entity235 , who announced in june that people carrying up to 2 ounces of pot will only be hit with a small fine , rather than be charged , and the infraction would n't result in a police record			2
@entity10 with police records attributable to marijuana use charges will have their names cleared , enabling them to seek formal employment and travel visas			2
@entity31 is more than sun and sand the original name @entity10 , bestowed by its original @entity251 inhabitants , means " land of wood and water , " fitting for a mountainous island endowed with several distinct climatic zones , from arid near - desert conditions complete with sand dunes along the south coast to tropical rain forest in the northeast to high elevation alpine areas where nighttime temperatures fall below freezing in the @entity266 and @entity267			1
this climatic diversity and abundant fresh water from subterranean springs and rivers crisscrossing every parish , affords the relatively small island excellent conditions for growing a wide range of crops			0
a hike up to @entity278 is a great way to take a break from the beach and get a bit of a workout			0
on a clear day , the summit affords spectacular views of @entity188 and the coastline of several parishes meeting the @entity61 sea to the @entity289			0
the @entity151 also provide bird watchers an opportunity to spot many of the island 's 280 species , 30 of which are endemic			0
@entity10 food is reason enough to visit the island while the country may be known for its jerk seasoning , which features local agricultural products like pimento ( allspice ) and hot scotch bonnet peppers , @entity10 cuisine has much more to offer and the island 's lively foodie culture may be the best representation of its national motto , " out of many , one people			0
" the influence of @entity312 cuisine is hard to miss , and curried goat , shrimp , lobster or vegetables are staples			0
of course the seafood is hard to beat , with escovitch snapper borrowing elements from @entity182 cuisine , while the accompaniment of fried bammy , made from cassava root , could n't be more local , as it was a staple starch for the original @entity251 inhabitants			0
the abundant fresh produce and quality of the ingredients on the island make it a natural manufacturing center for entrepreneurs concocting a wide array of sauces and preserves for the local market and export			2
@entity336 may be the most widely known condiment produced in @entity31 , but other more recent products on the scene , from @entity340 to @entity341 , are every bit as good			1
to get a taste of @entity31 's best flavors , stop by @entity345 in @entity347 district in the @entity151 to sample mouthwatering chutneys , pepper sauces and preserves and walk among citrus orchards , orchid gardens and the apiary , or spend a few nights on the town in @entity188 to sample the island 's best restaurants			1
@entity359 boutique resort in @entity360 holds regular farm - to - table dinners that are lively affairs featuring a rotating cast of guest chefs			0
