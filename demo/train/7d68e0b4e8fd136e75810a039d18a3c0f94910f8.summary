-- politics is a contact sport , and presidents tend to get tackled on every play , even the ones they 've executed perfectly			0
there is no better example than the criticism being hurled at president @entity8 for the killing of @entity10			1
it was a daring mission , fraught with peril for the @entity13 , but also full of political danger for @entity8			2
had the attempt failed , @entity8 would have faced the same kind of political and policy disaster that confronted president @entity18 after his helicopter rescue attempt of the @entity21 hostages crashed in april 1980			1
everyone would have second - guessed @entity8 , just as they did @entity18 , who lost re-election six months later			2
instead , @entity10 was eliminated , the @entity13 became instant heroes and the nation rejoiced			2
@entity27 approved of the raid overwhelmingly , and @entity8 got a much needed , though brief , job approval spike in the polls			2
at the time , even @entity8 's fiercest foes gave him a salute for making the right , tough choice			1
now president @entity8 is being reproached for taking too much credit for the success during his re-election campaign			1
sen. @entity37 called it " cheap " and " a pathetic , political act of self - congratulation			0
" democrats responded by questioning whether @entity42 would have gone after @entity10 , since he had criticized the expenditure of so much money to catch one person			1
@entity42 retorted that of course he would have grabbed @entity10 , adding that " even @entity18 would have given that order			2
" @entity27 's emotional high point in the last couple of years has become just one more partisan football			0
it would have been nice if that special moment of justice for @entity10 had remained above politics			0
perhaps president @entity8 and the @entity41 have overdone the " self - congratulation			1
" but did @entity56 think @entity8 's most clear - cut achievement in his first term would go unmentioned ? a campaign team that did n't focus on the key unifying event in @entity8 's entire presidency should be sued for political malpractice			1
the old rule still applies : a president should get the credit for all the good things , and must take the blame for all the bad things that happen on his watch			0
politicians are not shrinking violets , least of all presidents			0
naturally , @entity8 and his staff have capitalized fully on @entity10 and will continue to do so all the way to november			1
instead of trying to diminish the accomplishment , @entity56 would be better off conceding the point , congratulating @entity8 , and making the argument that the @entity10 mission was the exception that proves their contention that the president has failed to do what he promised in other spheres			1
is the country better off economically ? most @entity27 do n't seem happy with the weak recovery , which is the real issue that @entity42 will focus on in his pursuit of electoral victory			0
@entity8 promised a much stronger rebound after passage of his economic stimulus program , and he should be held to account for that			0
similarly , @entity8 's health care legislation -- controversial from the start -- has remained consistently unpopular , to judge by the polls , and is a legitimate target for the @entity56			1
a political party enhances its credibility if it mixes praise for something done well with criticism for the inadequacies that , in its view , should lead voters in a new direction			0
in our hyper - partisan era , political figures and both parties seem to be permanently stuck in petty attack mode , to their own detriment			0
the @entity10 success also illustrates an irony we should appreciate			2
the 2008 conventional wisdom about @entity8 was wrong			0
he was expected to be an effective domestic policy leader , but his lack of foreign policy experience meant he would n't know what to do when he got that dreaded 3 a.m. phone call			1
the reality of @entity8 's presidency has been the opposite			1
domestically , @entity8 has failed to revitalize the economy to the satisfaction of most voters , and his divisive health care and energy proposals increased partisanship in @entity130 and around the country			0
yet in foreign policy , he can tout many successes , from the ending of the disliked @entity135 and the scaling back in @entity137 to the overthrow of @entity139 and the flowering of democracy in several @entity143 nations			1
what parts of our current conventional wisdom about @entity8 and @entity42 are misguided ? since the future is unknowable , perhaps our projections should be less definitive and more tentative , if not humble			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

president @entity8 has been criticized for touting his success in killing @entity10
@entity151 : @entity8 's campaign should capitalize on the president 's achievement
he says *republicans* are better off picking on other issues
@entity151 : *defying* expectations , @entity8 has more success in foreign policy than domestic
