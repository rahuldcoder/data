@entity0 -- house speaker @entity3 's plan to raise the nation 's debt ceiling and slash government spending narrowly passed his chamber on friday and then was blocked by @entity8 , setting up a weekend of negotiations to seek a deal that would avoid a potential federal default next week			1
the @entity8 vote was 59 - 41 to table the measure , which effectively kills it unless @entity8 decide to bring it up again			2
earlier , @entity3 's proposal was approved by the @entity18 in a sharply polarized 218 - 210 vote that was delayed by a day while the speaker rounded up support from wary tea party conservatives			1
no @entity8 supported the measure , and 22 of the 240 members of the @entity26 majority also opposed it			2
even though it was blocked in the @entity8 , the @entity3 plan now is the @entity26 negotiating position for hammering out a deal with congressional @entity8 and president @entity30 to avert a possible government default next week			1
however , no face - to - face talks were scheduled , with @entity8 accusing @entity34 @entity33 of refusing to negotiate and @entity35 in turn seeking a chance for his caucus to reject a proposal offered by @entity34 @entity40 as a vehicle for compromise			1
@entity44 and @entity26 sources familiar with the situation told @entity1 that @entity35 insists the @entity18 be present in further negotiations toward a debt ceiling deal			1
in a continuation of the political theater that has characterized the negotiations so far , the @entity18 scheduled a vote on the @entity40 plan for saturday -- before the @entity8 will even begin considering it -- as what appeared to be payback for the rejection by @entity8 of the @entity3 proposal			1
@entity40 , meanwhile , said the @entity8 will likely vote to take up his plan at 1 a.m. sunday et as part of the procedural path required to get something passed in coming days			1
as the political maneuvering continues , the clock continues to tick down			0
if @entity64 fails to raise the current $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling by august 2 , @entity63 could face rising interest rates and a declining dollar , among other problems			1
some financial experts have warned of a downgrade of @entity63 's triple - a credit rating and a potential stock market plunge			0
the @entity73 dropped for a sixth straight day on friday			0
without an increase in the debt limit , the federal government will not be able to pay all its bills next month			0
@entity30 recently indicated he ca n't guarantee @entity79 checks will be mailed out on time			0
defense secretary @entity81 issued a statement friday to remind military personnel that they should plan to come to work next week as scheduled , regardless of whether a deal gets worked out			1
@entity81 pledged to do " everything possible to ensure that our national defense is protected			2
" a @entity89 official told @entity1 on condition of not being identified that on the possibility of military pay being withheld , " it 's not a question of whether , but when , if an agreement is n't reached			2
" friday 's @entity18 vote was a critical test of @entity3 's control over his tea party - infused @entity26 caucus			1
the speaker was forced to quell a right - wing revolt over the measure after a number of members complained that it does n't do enough to shrink the size of government and stem the tide of @entity0 's red ink			2
@entity3 , @entity110 , managed to sway several of those members by including a provision requiring congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the @entity115 before the debt ceiling can be extended through the end of 2012			1
in his floor speech before the vote , @entity3 called the proposal imperfect but necessary , and he criticized @entity30 and congressional @entity8 for rejecting all deficit reduction measures passed by the @entity18 so far			1
" we 've tried to do our level best ... but some people continue to say no , " @entity3 said , adding : " i stuck my neck out a mile to try to get an agreement with the president of the @entity63			2
" his voice rising to a shout , @entity3 continued to cheers and applause from fellow @entity26 : " it is time for this administration and the other party across the aisle -- put something on the table			0
tell us where you are			0
" @entity44 leaders vehemently object both to the balanced budget amendment and the requirement of a second debt ceiling vote before the next election			1
they argue that reaching bipartisan agreement on another debt ceiling hike during an election year could be nearly impossible , and that short - term extensions of the limit could further destabilize the economy			1
earlier in the day , @entity30 urged @entity8 and @entity26 to take the lead in the congressional deliberations			0
@entity3 's plan " has no chance of becoming law , " @entity30 said			1
" the time for putting party first is over			0
the time for compromise on behalf of the @entity63 people is now			0
... it 's important for everybody to step up and show the leadership that the @entity63 people expect			0
" " this is not a situation where the two parties are miles apart , " the president insisted			0
but " we are almost out of time			0
" @entity30 urged @entity63 to contact their members of @entity64 " to keep the pressure on @entity0			0
" phone lines on @entity174 were jammed friday as people from coast to coast tried to weigh in on the debate			0
meanwhile , @entity40 , @entity178 , has been pushing his own plan to raise the debt limit , though he will need to win over at least seven @entity8 @entity26 to win the 60 votes necessary to overcome a certain filibuster			1
@entity40 announced friday morning that he intended to " take action " on a @entity8 bill by the end of the day			1
later , he complained on the @entity8 floor that @entity26 would effectively filibuster his proposal by requiring a 60 - vote super-majority in the 100 - member chamber to support the start of debate on it			0
it was unclear when @entity40 would attempt to hold that vote , and he warned it could as late as 1 a.m. et sunday			0
@entity40 also blasted @entity3 's decision to include a mandatory balanced budget amendment provision in the @entity26 plan , calling the addition of " even more stuff in this right - wing leaning bill			1
... it 's really hard to comprehend			0
" sen. @entity204 , @entity178 - @entity205 , accused @entity3 of " adding all kinds of unrealistic poison pills to his plan			2
" but @entity35 , @entity210 , argued @entity8 were doing little to actually resolve the crisis			0
" i would suggest to my friends on the other side ... that they start taking their responsibilities as a majority party a little more seriously , because at this point , the only people who are disregarding the consequences of default are @entity8 -- not the @entity26 in the @entity18 -- but them , " @entity35 said			2
in a statement after the @entity18 vote , @entity35 said : " i eagerly await the majority leader 's plan for preventing this crisis			0
" leaders of both parties now agree that any deal to raise the debt ceiling should include long - term spending reductions to help control spiraling deficits			1
but they differ sharply on both the nature and timetable of the cuts			0
despite the strong partisan rhetoric , there have been signs of a growing recognition of a need for further compromise			0
earlier this week , @entity35 called for renewed negotiations with @entity30 , and indicated that his party must be willing to move away from some of its demands			0
sources close to the negotiations have also told @entity1 that vice president @entity247 is very much in the mix of back - channel conversations on a possible fallback position			0
@entity18 chief of staff @entity251 told @entity1 thursday that , presuming the @entity3 plan wins @entity18 approval and gets blocked in the @entity8 , the next step is for everyone " to take a step back in the @entity64 and look at where is a point of compromise			1
" @entity251 said that similarities between the @entity3 and @entity40 plans " may be the grounds for a deal that , hopefully , both parties can pass			2
" both plans suffered setbacks earlier this week when the nonpartisan @entity266 released reports concluding that they fell short of their stated deficit reduction goals			0
@entity3 's plan , which has since been revised , proposed generating a total of $ 917 billion in savings while initially raising the debt ceiling by $ 900 billion			1
the speaker has pledged to match any debt ceiling hike with dollar - for - dollar spending cuts			1
his plan , however , would require a second vote by @entity64 to raise the debt ceiling by a combined $ 2.5 trillion -- enough to last through the end of 2012			1
it would create a special congressional committee to recommend additional savings of $ 1.6 trillion or more			2
any failure on the part of @entity64 to enact mandated spending reductions or abide by new spending caps would trigger automatic across - the - board budget cuts			0
the plan , as amended friday , also calls for congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the @entity115 before the second vote to raise the debt ceiling , which would likely be required at some point during the winter			1
as for @entity40 's plan , a revised version he proposed friday would reduce deficits over the next decade by $ 2.4 trillion and raise the debt ceiling by a similar amount			1
it includes $ 1 trillion in savings based on the planned @entity63 withdrawals from military engagements in @entity306 and @entity307			2
@entity40 's plan also would establish a congressional committee made up of 12 @entity18 and @entity8 members to consider additional options for debt reduction			1
the committee 's proposals would be guaranteed by a @entity8 vote with no amendments by the end of the year			2
in addition , it incorporates a process based on proposal by @entity35 that would give @entity30 the authority to raise the debt ceiling in two steps while providing @entity64 the opportunity to vote its disapproval			1
among other things , @entity40 has stressed that his plan meets the key @entity26 demand for no additional taxes			2
@entity3 , however , argued this week that @entity40 's plan fails to tackle popular entitlement programs such as @entity331 , which are among the biggest drivers of the debt			1
a recent @entity1 / @entity334 reveals a growing public exasperation and demand for compromise			0
sixty - four percent of respondents to a july 18 - 20 survey preferred a deal with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases			0
only 34 % preferred a debt reduction plan based solely on spending reductions			0
according to the poll , the public is sharply divided along partisan lines ; democrats and independents are open to a number of different approaches because they think a failure to raise the debt ceiling would cause a major crisis for the country			1
republicans , however , draw the line at tax increases , and a narrow majority of them oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstances			2
@entity1 's @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 and @entity372 contributed to this report			0
