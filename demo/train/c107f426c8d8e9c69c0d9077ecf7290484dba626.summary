the city of @entity1 is expecting more than 40 million visitors this year			1
if you 're among the inbound , you 're going to need to do a lot more than leave the heavy coats at home and drop a few " dudes " into your repartee if you do n't want to be mistaken for the latest @entity11 wannabe to drop off a turnip truck			1
follow these tips and you just might pass for a local			1
if your deception goes well , you can bring your suave @entity18 persona home from vacation and try it out with your locals			0
just do n't push it			1
having " @entity25 " as a ringtone is a little much			0
do n't mention the weather the wonderful monotony of not - too - hot , low - humidity days and mild nights is taken for granted			1
weather is n't a topic of conversation -- unless something really weird is happening , like , you know , rain			1
for @entity36 's sake , do n't order a @entity37 @entity37 is the sort of bland corporate bilge a @entity41 drinker graduates to when he gets his first good job after college , so have a @entity45 or a @entity46 instead			1
and unless you 're auditioning for the role of village idiot , do n't ask " when is @entity50 this year ? " that 's been known to happen			1
in @entity52 , do n't be nonplussed by anything if every day is like an @entity54 overseen by an lsd aficionado -- and in @entity52 it is -- you deal with it			1
you do n't go slack - jawed when you see a five - legged dog relieving himself on a square of grass while mustachioed women and men with elaborate facial tattoos full of typos look on			2
in @entity11 , show your cool if you wangle an invitation to a " screener " -- a showing of a completed but unreleased movie for industry types and critics -- be early			2
there are n't any trailers			2
seven p.m. means the feature starts at 7 p.m. do n't be demonstrative or loud			2
you 're there because you have something to do with the film industry			2
eat at a food truck the food truck scene is amazing and getting more so			2
example : get toasted , a truck featuring superb @entity88 - @entity87 hybrid comfort food , comes along , and its originality and excellence do n't even stand out			2
honor the local deities there are popular @entity18 , there are admired @entity18			2
and then there are the @entity18 who might as well be secular gods , they 're so beloved			0
the first is warm , witty @entity96 broadcaster @entity95 , who has been announcing the team 's games since 1950 , when the franchise was in @entity100			1
@entity95 manages to be funny and insightful without ever being mean			1
he 's like family to millions of people			0
@entity95 used to be alone on this island of extreme @entity1 esteem			1
now he 's been joined by @entity105 , the sunny former @entity107 superstar turned @entity109 activist and business tycoon			0
magic is so gracious that he almost seems too good to be true			0
in a city full of phonies and in a sports world full of arrogant jerks , he easily connects with everyone			0
unless you want people to think you 're from @entity120			0
have an opinion on @entity122 and @entity123 if you live in @entity1 , especially if you 're a male able to breathe , you have to have a considered take on @entity123 and @entity125 , the testy @entity127 duo that brought three consecutive @entity127 titles to the @entity107			1
their snippy , contentious 1995 - 2004 run with the @entity107 amounts to the " @entity131 " of real - life sports psychodramas			0
you can be pro-shaq : @entity123 did n't want @entity122 to win a fourth @entity133 in the 2004 matchup with @entity135 , so he would n't pass to @entity122 even though @entity122 was being covered by a midget , costing the @entity107 the title			0
you can be pro-kobe : @entity122			0
if he cared as much as @entity123 , the @entity107 would have won the @entity138 every year			0
you can be down on both : @entity122 coasted on raw physical dominance more than any athlete ever , and yeah , @entity123 works hard , but in his heart of hearts , he is me - first			0
but for @entity36 's sake , do n't say , " you know that @entity122 and @entity123 ? they were sure something ! " at least if you 're a male able to breathe			1
be discreet about celebrity sightings if you 're eager to see someone famous , that defines you as a @entity152			0
but if you really want a celebrity story to take back home , you can get one a lot more discreetly than by hanging around @entity156 or @entity157 and gawking at the patrons			0
instead , go to the fancy @entity160 grocery store on @entity161 in @entity162			0
on a saturday morning , you ca n't throw a rock without hitting someone who 's at least been a regular on a network tv show			1
but you might not recognize him or her -- because at @entity160 , unlike @entity156 , the celebrities are n't wearing copious makeup			0
@entity172 moved to @entity173 in 1990 and has been a @entity175 journalist ever since , writing for such newspapers as the @entity1 @entity177 and @entity178 and appearing dozens of times on " the @entity180 " on @entity181 and " airtalk with @entity183 " on @entity184 , a @entity185 affiliate .			1

dying to be part of the @entity1 scene ? no ? good , you 're already half local
@entity52 is a freak show ; that does n't mean you should freak out there
*author* says drinking @entity37 marks you out as a newbie
if you see @entity95 , *bow* down before him . or just listen to him call @entity96 game on the radio
