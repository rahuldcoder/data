-- 2014 is an election year			0
we know this because , once again , the @entity4 are out in force with voices raised , full of outrage , trying to convince women that new laws are needed to ensure that they receive equal pay for equal work			1
equal pay for equal work			2
sounds pretty simple , right ? we all agree that a woman doing the same job as a man should not be paid less just because she 's a woman			0
unfortunately , the broader issue is not that simple			2
what if one employee has more education ? what if that employee has been with the company longer or has more experience ? these are questions that courts have been mediating since 1963 as companies have faced lawsuits over gender discrimination with regard to wages			2
why 1963 ? because that is when the @entity33 was signed into law by president @entity35			1
the law says that " no employer shall discriminate between employees on the basis of sex			0
" and it passed the @entity42 that year by a 362 - 9 vote			0
that 's right , nine @entity4 voted against it			1
@entity4 highlight equal pay in political push for the past two election cycles , @entity4 have tried to paint @entity49 as backward cavemen on this issue as part of their so - called " @entity53 , " claiming that @entity49 do n't care about women because they opposed the @entity55			1
never mind that the @entity55 had little to do with the premise of equal pay for equal work and everything to do with the time limit for trial lawyers looking to exploit a potential claim			2
@entity4 consistently ignore data from neutral sources that indicates that when you actually compare men and women with the same background and education doing the same job , equality of pay has been largely achieved			1
@entity72 , a compensation data company , has shown that in careers from software developer to nursing to construction project manager to human resources administrator , women are within 1 % to 4 % of men in terms of pay equity			1
@entity81 to strengthen equal pay protections however , much of the research on women voters in recent years supports the notion that women believe that men get paid more for the same job than women do			1
there are several reasons for this : 1 ) personal experience , 2 ) friend to friend examples and 3 ) @entity95 politicians with manufactured data perpetuating it			0
so what is a @entity49 candidate to do ? first , every @entity49 should affirm , without hesitation , support for the concept of equal pay for equal work			1
there should be no perceived daylight between @entity49 and @entity4 on this basic value			1
@entity4 seize on equal pay as midterm issue second , every @entity49 should remind voters that they support the @entity33			1
they should affirm that , had they been in @entity110 at the time , they would have voted to pass it and that the only " nay " votes recorded that day came from @entity4			2
and @entity49 should remind women that if they are not receiving the equal pay that they deserve , the law is on their side and that bad actors should be vigorously prosecuted			1
third , all @entity49 should know their facts			2
be prepared to challenge the media and their opponents when they try to claim that some new piece of legislation is necessary to ensure equal pay			2
not every problem in @entity126 can be fixed by @entity127			0
every disparity that exists in the workplace is not an opportunity for a new piece of legislation			0
fourth , every @entity49 should celebrate companies that have decided it is good business to have a diverse workplace			1
we should applaud those that have gone out of their way to attract women and give them a rich and robust work experience			0
and there are plenty of great examples in the @entity149 list , " the 10 best companies for women in 2014 " : -- @entity152 , which has a @entity153 that tries to bring women who left to have children back to @entity152			0
-- @entity156 , which has an impressive 55 % female workforce and 58 % female management team			0
-- @entity159 , which has a mentorship program where senior level women pursue opportunities on behalf of younger women within the company			0
as we celebrate these success stories and condemn bad actors , workplace experiences for all women will improve			0
finally , all @entity49 should support initiatives to encourage young girls to enter traditionally male - dominated fields such as science , technology , engineering and math. these important @entity178 fields are crucial to our country 's future and provide incredible opportunities for women to achieve high earnings			1
as of last month , there were 4.7 million unemployed women in this country			0
what is sad indeed is the willingness by @entity95 candidates to use the issue of pay equity as a political football to change the subject from that sobering statistic and the fact that women ca n't keep their insurance plans or their doctors because the promise of @entity201 turned out to be a lie			1
these are the real challenges facing women today			0
but the truth can be inconvenient when it does n't fit into the @entity4 ' narrative of a trumped up " @entity53			2
" join us on @entity209 / @entity208 .			0

@entity211 says @entity4 use the pay equity issue as a political football
*republicans* , she argues , can take five steps to combat the ploy
@entity221 should remind voters that they support the @entity33 , she said
she also says @entity49 should support companies with a diversified workforce
