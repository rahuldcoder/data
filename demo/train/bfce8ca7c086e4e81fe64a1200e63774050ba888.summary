-- " writing is hard work			1
if you want to succeed , do n't ever give up ! " says 17 - year - old author @entity3			1
@entity3 , a senior at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , speaks from experience			1
@entity3 is an accomplished writer of fantasy - fiction books for young adults			1
an accomplished writer of fantasy - fiction books for young adults , @entity3 published her first title when she was just 11			1
@entity3 's second book , " @entity14 " rose to no. 5 on @entity15 's daily @entity18 fantasy fiction best - seller list			1
her third novel , " @entity20 , " is scheduled to hit book stores in december			1
@entity0 's @entity22 sat down with @entity3 to find out how she started writing and the secret to her success			1
@entity22 : @entity3 , what was your first book , and how did it come about ? @entity3 : my first book was " the @entity32			1
" the reason i wrote it is kind of an interesting story			2
my sister @entity36 was 6 at the time , and i was reading " @entity37			2
" @entity36 tried to read it , but she could n't because of the vocabulary			2
i did n't like seeing her upset all the time , so i decided : " ok , i ca n't do anything with ' @entity37 ; ' but what if i wrote another story for her , something that she will understand ? " and that 's where " the @entity32 " came from			2
@entity22 : what inspired you to publish " the @entity32 " ? @entity3 : the inspiration to publish it came from a schoolteacher			1
we were supposed to write a short story , and i was like , " ok , i 'll just bring in my book			1
" the teacher took it home , read it and loved it			2
she said , " why do n't you try to publish it ? " i mean , it was just bizarre ; i had never even dreamed of that , and suddenly it was an opportunity			1
and i said , " ok , i can try			2
" @entity22 : what steps have you gone through to get your books published ? @entity3 : this first book was actually self - published , because it was ok , but it was n't super-great			1
but i was absolutely amazed when " @entity32 " came out			2
when i held that book in my hands for the first time , i did n't care if it was self - published ; i was proud of it , and it inspired me further			2
... i said , " let 's do this again on a 14 - year - old scale , " which was the age i was when i wrote " @entity14			2
" " @entity14 " came out because of my passion for fantasy			0
that book i published through a traditional process			0
as a first - time author , it 's almost impossible to get to a traditional publisher , but i won a short - story contest with the publishing company			1
then , i contacted the publishers and said , " hey , i actually have a book written			0
do you want to check it out ? " and they said , " ok			0
" and that 's how " @entity14 " got out			0
so " @entity14 " came out , and i was absolutely psyched ! i was holding this book , this real book , that was traditionally published , and i start thinking , " ok , it 's good , but i can do better			0
" and so , when i was 15 , i sat down and started writing " @entity96			0
" i 've been working on it for two years			0
it 's book one of a trilogy , and it 's a science fiction / fantasy story			0
@entity22 : what 's " @entity96 " about ? @entity3 : it 's basically about my life , the way i would love it to be in a fantasy world			1
it 's about this girl			0
she lives an ordinary life ... and everything is going great			0
and then she goes walking and finds a pocket watch and she thinks , " wow			0
" so , she picks it up and she 's looking at it and suddenly she presses a button , completely accidentally , and it teleports her to another planet , another world			0
it 's basically her adventures as she starts to discover that there are things other than just her happy little life on @entity122			0
@entity22 : what 's the writing process like for you ? @entity3 : it 's a lot about not giving up			1
i had writer 's block every two days			0
... it 's so difficult because of the way i write			2
i think of the beginning and i think of the end , and then i have to fill in everything in between			0
it 's a lot of planning and a lot of rewriting			0
the version of " @entity96 " i just finished , i rewrote five times from scratch			0
@entity22 : when you 're writing a book , do you think about it all the time ? @entity3 : absolutely ! when i 'm really into the book , it becomes this world for me			1
in the trilogy , i 've been working with these characters for two years			0
these characters are as real to me as any of my friends or my family			0
@entity22 : does writing come naturally for you , or do you have to work at it ? @entity3 : writing is just like everything else : it 's the classic 90 percent hard work and 10 percent talent			1
it 's just a lot of hard work			0
my rule is write a little bit every single day			1
it does n't matter what it is -- a homework assignment , a poem or an e-mail -- but you 've got to write something every single day .			1
