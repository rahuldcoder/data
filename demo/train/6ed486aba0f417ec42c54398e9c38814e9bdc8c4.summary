-- when command sgt. maj. @entity2 of the @entity3 announced that fast - food offerings like @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 were being shuttered in @entity8 , he was blunt about it			1
" this is a warzone , not an amusement park , " he wrote on the @entity3 blog			0
these mobile restaurants and others that can be found on large bases in @entity16 and @entity17 , are " nonessentials " and are being shut down to streamline delivery of much - needed battlefield supplies			1
however , according to some soldiers and @entity23 -- all of whom have served in combat in @entity25 or @entity8 -- access to the familiar hometown mall fare is n't as important to morale as many civilians may have thought			1
the veterans and active - duty troops all said that access to healthy foods , local cuisine and packages of snacks sent by friends and family trumped military base fast food as morale boosters			1
the announcement of the fast - food outposts ' shuttering inspired a lively debate on @entity0 's @entity8 blog about morale and the amenities afforded servicemen and women serving overseas -- often in harm 's way			1
those affected , however , did n't seem very concerned			2
" the big things that improve morale in a combat zone are lots of letters and packages from loved ones , " @entity23 cpl. @entity54 said			2
especially appreciated in these care packages are sweet , sour , salty and spicy condiments , such as @entity64 , sugar packets and seasoned salts for enlivening the military 's frequently derided meals ready to eat -- individually packaged rations for service members stationed away from meal preparation facilities			2
these high - calorie @entity72 , which have long drawn criticism for depressingly bland flavors and textures , are precisely what @entity54 , who served two tours in @entity25 , says drove his fellow troops to seek out more flavorful , familiar fast food			2
others look a little closer to their temporary home , sampling the local fare			0
while many soldiers out on combat patrols were , according to @entity88 capt. @entity87 , " too tired and drained to care much about their meal , " he developed a taste for @entity25 flavors during his tour , which lasted from 2002 to 2008			0
while he stands up for food on base , calling it " decent " and " healthier " than fast - food alternatives , he still misses his favorite flatbread , which he 'd buy while out on patrol , and he laments not being able to find anything like it stateside			0
similarly adventurous , previously deployed @entity23 now at @entity103 's @entity102 do n't have to venture far from their barracks to indulge in the @entity106 - style specialties they 've come to love			2
according to the @entity111 , @entity110 's @entity109 now serves the eponymous gyro - like sandwich -- as well as hummus , tabbouleh salad and baklava -- to @entity23 who 'd been stationed in @entity25 and the @entity118			0
@entity87 , while lauding the indigenous cuisine , also cried foul about fatty @entity121 fast foods , saying that " overweight soldiers are a problem			1
" army sgt. @entity124 , who is serving in @entity25 , agrees with the captain but indulges in " the occasional pizza from @entity5 , burrito from @entity128 , or maybe even a sandwich from @entity130 , " citing the virtue of being able to enjoy a pizza in the middle of the desert and escape for a few minutes to talk with fellow soldiers about their homes , sweethearts or future plans			1
ultimately , though , the military is a culture of intense physical fitness , and access to nutritious meals at mess halls helps servicemen and women maintain their physical and psychological			0
and @entity124 says that " a soldier has a responsibility to maintain himself			0
" while deployed troops can certainly take the reins of their physical health , friends and family stateside can still boost morale and offer a taste of home with much - appreciated care packages			1
the @entity158 maintains a list of links to groups coordinating care packages for overseas soldiers			0
according to the @entity121 @entity167 , most foods that are tightly prepackaged and immune to mold or bacterial growth are safe for sending to soldiers			1
they recommend dried proteins , like beef and turkey jerky , as well as dehydrated soups , dried fruits and even dense baked goods like fruitcakes			0
just make sure to seal it all up with a kiss .			0
