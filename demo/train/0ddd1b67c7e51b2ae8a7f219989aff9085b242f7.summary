-- creative new takes on dim sum are a common trend in @entity5 restaurants these days , particularly at the higher end , with chefs incorporating traditionally @entity9 ingredients such as truffles , foie gras or @entity13 lobster			1
at the same time , many classic dim sum dishes have fallen out of fashion , making them harder to find in the city			1
chef @entity17 , 76 , worked at @entity5 's @entity19 restaurant for 30 years before retiring			2
he recently rejoined to launch a special " retro dim sum " menu to bring back a few of the classics , but only in march and april			1
@entity17 says there are a couple reasons these dishes have gone out of style			2
" @entity27 of all , a lot of the classic dim sum like the pork 's liver siu mai and quail egg siu mai are very high in cholesterol , " he says			1
" it 's unhealthy in modern day 's standard			2
therefore , fewer and fewer restaurants put them on the menu			2
" " secondly , they are labor - intensive and time - consuming			2
" @entity42 mai with quail egg the quail egg is the star of this rich bite			1
a boiled quail 's egg is placed inside the pork - centric filling , with the dumpling exterior enclosing the contents completely before the whole thing is steamed			1
the flavor of the bouncy filling is heightened ( and complemented ) by the quail egg , with the intense yolk the predominant taste			1
as chef @entity17 points out , part of the reason this dim sum dish is no longer as popular is due to the fact it packs a high cholesterol punch			1
but it 's what experts refer to as the good cholesterol ( @entity68 )			0
quail eggs have been used in @entity71 medicine for years as a healing food , and the latest @entity9 research says they 're good for you too -- in moderation			1
more : breathtaking pictures of @entity5 airport 's glory days from the chef 's point of view they 're tricky to peel , so their preparation may not be cost effective for some restaurants			2
that said , it 's one of the easier traditional dim sum on this list to find			1
restaurants offering siu mai with quail egg include @entity92 ( famous for its classic dim sum ) , @entity94 and , in march and april only , @entity19			1
( see below for restaurant contact details			0
) @entity42 mai with liver pig liver is the hero of this dish			2
a sizable piece of flash - fried liver is draped over the mostly pork - filled dumpling			2
the combination of the mild yet rich liver and the filling ( sometimes bearing hints of dried mandarin or tangerine ) creates a complex , velvety smooth morsel that 's surprisingly light to eat			0
no doubt it 'd be a hit with foie gras fans			0
" it takes a day or two to process the liver so it no longer carries the musky taste , " says chef @entity17			0
@entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 are go - to places for this dim sum			1
many of these restaurants also serve siu mai with quail egg			1
@entity71 sausage bun popular in the 1960s , the @entity71 sausage bun is a seasonal creation sold mainly in the winter			1
not to be confused with the bread - and - frankfurter bun sold in local bakeries , this bun , made from the same dough as char siu bao ( barbecued pork bun ) has a @entity71 sausage ( laap cheung ) center			1
any good version should feature a pillowy bun that complements and contrasts with the firm sausage			2
steaming releases the sausage 's oils , flavorings and marinades , resulting in a memorable mouthful			0
health risks associated with the consumption of preserved meats , combined with the high fat content , are key reasons this bun is now a rarity on @entity5 streets			1
venues still serving it include @entity157 , @entity121 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
giant chicken bun as the name implies , this dish consists of a large bun , which is steamed			0
what 's not obvious from the name is the filling -- a smorgasbord of savory goodies that varies depending on the maker			0
typical ingredients include chicken , barbecued pork , shrimp , duck , black mushroom and quail eggs that are often marinated in @entity71 rose wine			2
it was once a favorite of @entity5 's labor force as it 's a satisfying and varied mini-meal			2
that 's also why it 's not such a hit now -- modern diners prefer to sample a bigger variety of lighter dim sum when eating			1
plus , it 's time consuming to make and requires a deft hand to get the balance of ingredients right and create a harmonious symphony of flavors			0
this one can be found in restaurants that have some history behind them , including @entity121 and @entity120 , as well as @entity19 ( in march and april )			0
black sesame film rice roll this jet black dessert is called " fay lum " ( film ) as it resembles a roll of camera film			0
rice flour and black sesame are the key ingredients -- they 're made into a paste , spread onto a tray , steamed , cooled and then rolled			0
it has a smooth , silky texture with a bit of bite that 's all about the sesame			0
it 's a tricky item to make that takes time , which is one reason it 's not as common as it once was , making way for ubiquitous mango puddings or egg tarts			2
" you have to first fry the sesame , then hand grind it to create a paste , " says chef @entity17			0
" then steam it until it forms a thin layer of film			0
if we 're making them , we want them to be tasty			0
but in order to make them delicious , it takes a lot of effort			0
" @entity236 can still be found at @entity157 and @entity19 ( in march and april as part of its retro dim sum menu )			1
beef wrapped in caul fat popular in the 1930s and 1940s , this juicy , bouncy morsel consists of the beef siu mai filling ( sometimes beef balls ) encased in a fine layer of caul fat , which melts through the beef when it 's steamed			1
chefs have different ways to prepare the beef , but it often consists of finely chopped meat , water chestnuts , coriander and dried mandarin peel			0
@entity157 and @entity257 serve this classic , which has diminished in popularity for two reasons -- it takes skill to make and is considered too fatty by many diners			0
rarer still a few other beloved and missed dim sum dishes include steamed duck feet dim sum			1
@entity19 is serving steamed duck feet and yam rolled with bean curd skin in march and april as part of its special menu			0
meanwhile , @entity121 serves its duck feet with taro and fish maw wrapped in fried bean curd skin , while @entity278 ofers a dish of braised duck feet with mushroom			0
there 's also the amusingly named " bone wrapped in paper " and " chicken wrapped in paper , " an aromatic style of dim sum in which seasoned and marinated spare ribs or chicken are placed in a cellophane " envelope " along with ingredients such as dried mushroom , coriander , chestnut and @entity71 sausage , before being deep fried			1
it 's difficult to find the bone version ; however the chicken version can sometimes be found at @entity157			0
another bite of nostalgia no longer widely found is gun tong gaau ( large , steamed soup dumplings ) still served at @entity307 , @entity120 and @entity159			0
view the above gallery for photos of some of these classics , plus a couple more dim sum dishes that are also increasingly rare			1

as innovative chefs create modern takes on dim sum , some of the classics are getting harder to find
a few @entity5 restaurants continue to offer hard - to - find tastes like siu mai with quail egg
health concerns have caused some dishes to fall from favor , such as the @entity71 sausage bun
