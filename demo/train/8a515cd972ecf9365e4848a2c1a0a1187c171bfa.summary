@entity0 is getting into e-commerce			1
it 's now possible to buy goods online in two steps by tweeting a special hashtag			1
the new collaboration between @entity0 and @entity7 will turn the social media service into a shopping cart			1
@entity7 members who sign up will be able to buy products by mentioning the appropriate hashtag in a tweet			1
the @ @entity15 account will tweet back with a confirmation hashtag			0
once you tweet that confirmation hashtag , @entity7 will shoot you a confirmation e-mail and give you 15 minutes to confirm you want the product			1
your card will be charged and the goods shipped to your billing address			1
the two companies announced the partnership on monday and kicked it off with a single product offering , a $ 25 @entity7 gift card for $ 15			2
other products will be available starting wednesday morning			0
to start @entity0 shopping you 'll need to first sync your @entity7 card with @entity0			1
the service will only work with compatible @entity7 cards ( no prepaid or corporate cards ) and a public @entity0 account			1
since protected accounts are n't allowed , there 's no way to take advantage of a discount without it being public information			0
that means each purchase is not only money for the various companies involved , but also an automatic promotion for the product and its brands			0
the first discounted products @entity7 will sell are an @entity48 , a @entity50 cam , a @entity52 - designed bracelet and an @entity53			1
though various companies will tweet out the hashtags , all official product offers will be collected under the @entity58 section			0
this is not the first time @entity7 has experimented with social media			2
its @entity63 program , launched last march , offers discounts on @entity0 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
on @entity0 , you tweet the hashtag for an offer and then go make the purchase in person or through a separate online store			2
the discount is then applied to your @entity7 account within eight weeks			2
social networks have been working hard to break into e-commerce			0
@entity66 announced @entity78 , which lets users make purchases for friends directly through the social network			2
buying products this way is a unique case			0
because it 's for select discounted products , many of which will only be available for a set period , tweet - buying is not for people who are searching for a specific product or comparison shopping			0
it has much more in common with flash sales sites like @entity97 than e-commerce mainstays like @entity99			0
by wrapping the entire purchasing process in a hashtag , the service makes buying fast and easy			0
if it takes off , we could see hashtags for products in commercials and print ads.			0

@entity0 and @entity7 team up to let *cardholders* buy products with a hashtag
the discounted goods will require two tweets and then ship to your billing address
@entity7 already has discounts on @entity66 and other networks via hashtags
