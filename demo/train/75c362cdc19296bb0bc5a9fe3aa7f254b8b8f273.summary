" @entity2 , who won a bronze in the last global championships in @entity13 two years ago , set a national record of 10.83 seconds for the 100m earlier this season to underline her medal potential			1
only two - time @entity19 champion @entity18 of @entity20 , who went on to claim the gold , and @entity23 's @entity22 have run faster this year			0
