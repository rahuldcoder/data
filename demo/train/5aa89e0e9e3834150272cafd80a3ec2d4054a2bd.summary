this one was big but it 's not the @entity2			2
an 8.2 - magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern chile tuesday night , triggering small landslides , setting off a tsunami and killing at least five people			0
but geologists say an even larger quake in the region is lurking			1
" this magnitude 8.2 is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area , " said @entity12 , a geophysicist at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			0
" we 're expecting a potentially even larger earthquake			2
" it could be tomorrow			0
or it could be 50 years			2
" we do not know when it 's going to occur , " he said			1
here 's why : @entity5 sits on an arc of volcanos and fault lines circling the @entity28 known as the " @entity29			1
" this area sees frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions			0
the country itself has seen no shortage of seismic activity in recent years			1
since 1973 , @entity5 has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude - 7.0 and above			1
powerful earthquake strikes off @entity5 , triggers tsunami in 2010 , about 500 people died when an 8.8 - magnitude earthquake hit			1
that quake was so violent , it moved one whole city about 10 feet west			2
@entity12 says tuesday 's quake is of interest because the fault line along @entity5 's coast has constantly shifted during the last 140 years			1
in recent weeks , this area has seen a cluster of activity -- something like 50 to 100 smaller quakes			1
then , late last month , a 6.7 and a 6.1 magnitude quake struck			0
when quakes happen , the surface ruptures			0
the two sides of the fault slip past each other			0
but the area to the north and south of tuesday 's quake " did not rupture in this event , " @entity12 said			1
and it 's " still an area that has n't ruptured in 140 - odd years			1
" given that it 's an area of frequent quakes , and frequent ruptures , it may only be a matter of time			0
" we expect another 8.8 - 8.9 earthquake here sometime in the future , " @entity12 said			0
the good news ? " it may not occur for many , many years			2
" what you need to know about earthquakes measuring the magnitude of earthquakes the place where two earthquakes hit every hour			0

geologists say an even larger quake in the region is lurking
*scientist* : " we do not know when it 's going to occur "
