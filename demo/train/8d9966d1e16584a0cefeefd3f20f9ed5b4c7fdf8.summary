a firm old @entity1 friend , an elderly one now , who lived through @entity2 , told me this when i lived in @entity4 : there is a difference between government and state			1
the houses of @entity10 was government and did the work			1
the queen was state , and represented the government free of ideology , and therefore could be a living embodiment of neutrality and frosty maternal concern for all			1
i did n't see it while i lived there			0
i was a radical @entity23 ( anti-royalty ) simply because i 'm an @entity25			1
but in the years since we in the @entity25 have begun to cry " impeach " at the slightest grammatical slip of our leader , who happens to be head of both government and state , i have begun to see the practicality of a figurehead leader who has no political power , but is more eminent , always , than government			1
opinion : baby helps make a monarchy better we have one too : she is called the @entity40			1
but she does n't give birth to a real human young			0
the @entity40 is copper , and blind			0
the current old @entity44 is blinkered , and human , and revered for her humanizing failings as well as her work ethic			0
there is so much about the royal family that does n't work , but one thing it does do well is prove is that generations of squabbling citizens can indeed survive their differences and continue , persevere as a nation			2
the royalty is a testament to longevity of the nation , if it is nothing else			2
and so now there is a new baby boy			0
by dint of holy ignorance , a newborn child can have nothing to do with the longevity of @entity1			0
the child of @entity69 , and her husband , prince @entity70 , makes immediate claim on our hope and our ability to splash out blessings simply because he is royal			1
but so too does any child : he or she declares the future for us			0
opinion : how to raise a royal baby children testify to longevity , to continuity			2
children , as my friend , the writer @entity84 , once wrote , " stand in a different relationship to time " than we do			0
they have eternity where we have actuarial tables			0
this particular baby , with the @entity93 hand - stitched into his nappies , this child too stands in for that nation 's hope for all children : that they will thrive , somehow , against all odds			1
by extension , because babies provide us older types a kind of vitamin nutrition we can get from no other source , we have to smile , too			0
we @entity25 love our children as much as the @entity105			1
we love to hope for their future , for all of them .			2

@entity109 : in @entity105 , @entity10 is government , queen is ' state ' *--* concern for *subjects*
he says with *fractious* @entity25 government , an eminent figurehead starts to look practical
he says much wrong about monarchy , but it does show a nation 's continuity , *cooperation*
@entity109 : @entity126 and @entity69 's new baby makes immediate claim on nation 's hope for its future
