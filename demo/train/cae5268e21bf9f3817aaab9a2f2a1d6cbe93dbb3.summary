the @entity1 @entity0 ruled that a person has a " right to be forgotten			1
" in response , some think that the sky is falling			0
@entity9 , a @entity10 citizen , was displeased that any @entity12 search for his name turned up a 16 - year - old report on a real estate auction connected with some old debts			1
@entity9 believed that this was out - of - date and irrelevant information with respect to him today			2
the @entity1 @entity0 agreed and ruled that the @entity21 's right to privacy guarantees include a " right to be forgotten			1
" the court ordered @entity12 to remove links to archived newspaper pages that contained the old information after @entity9 sued @entity12 and the newspaper in 2010			1
the @entity29 ruled that a @entity1 's right to privacy includes the right to say , " this is really old information , and it no longer reflects who i am			1
" the court held that someone 's right to privacy overrides @entity12 's economic interest and even the public 's right to old and irrelevant information			1
we should be jealous of our friends in @entity1			1
as @entity1 protects individual rights , @entity44 persists in its belief that rights are for big corporations , people be damned			1
until recently , humans had comfort in knowing that mistakes were rarely forever			2
but the @entity52 has brought us a " mistakes are forever " society			2
now , even a financial hiccup 16 years ago remained as prominent for @entity9 , as if it happened yesterday			0
now , a revenge porn picture will remain on a victim 's @entity12 results forever , victimizing the subject every day			1
even deserved criticism , like an old criminal record , will remain forever -- as if it happened yesterday			1
time is no longer linear for us			0
is this how we want to live ? should we not have a right to be forgotten ? during the @entity68 , we despised totalitarian regimes that kept a dossier on every citizen , holding compromising information in store for the day that it served to discredit him or her			2
i remember learning that the @entity77 kept files on dissidents in the ' 60s and ' 70s			0
i remember learning a few months ago , thanks to @entity81 , that the @entity82 is spying on us			0
nobody thinks that is a good thing			0
@entity87 's reaction , like anything that reins in companies ' rights to abuse us , was a shriek of little substance			0
@entity12 does n't like being told what to do , and critics raised an outcry about first amendment rights			1
@entity12 could have instituted a responsible policy like this on its own			2
but @entity12 's position is like that of a petulant child : " you 're not the boss of me ! " and that is why we ca n't have nice things			1
well , is n't there a little bad in this ruling ? theoretically , yes			0
this could be abused to get rid of important truthful information			0
that is a bad thing , and i would find that intolerable if someone tried to abuse it to suppress legitimate criticism or information that the public has a right to know			2
but the ruling does not say that old information must be deleted			0
it does n't even say that @entity12 has to comply with requests			1
it just says that if a @entity1 requests that information come down , @entity12 must respect the request but can refuse if it has good cause			1
and that good cause is where free expression and freedom of information remains intact			0
one critic asked whether ex-nazis could use this ruling to hide their participation in the @entity138			0
the answer to that is a resounding no. the ruling ends with an admonishment			0
the " right to be forgotten " does not apply if it appears for " particular reasons " : if there is good cause to interfere with the citizen 's right to privacy , including " the role played by the data subject in public life , " and if a majority of the evidence shows that the general public has a right to that information			1
sorry , old nazis , you ca n't use this to hide your involvement in the @entity138			0
in fact , public figures and public events will never be erased			0
this ruling is for you , the average @entity166 who just wants to live an obscure and private life			0
if you lived in @entity1 , you would have regained that right today .			2

@entity1 court ruled that you have a " right to be forgotten , " @entity12 links taken down
@entity174 : this means a person can say information " no longer reflects who i am "
now , @entity12 forever reveals old *problems* : debt , criminal record , " revenge porn " photos
@entity174 : this right does n't apply if the general public has a right to that information
