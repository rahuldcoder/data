@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 and the @entity3 began assembling ships for joint war exercises sunday off the west coast of the @entity7 in the @entity8 , a source at the @entity10 told @entity2			1
the exercises are set to begin as diplomats worked to ease tensions in the @entity14 after @entity15 warned of unpredictable " consequences " if the @entity3 fulfills its vow of deploying an aircraft carrier to the @entity8 for joint military maneuvers with @entity1			1
the exercises are scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. sunday ( 1 a.m. et )			2
@entity22 's foreign minister spoke with his @entity24 , @entity3 , and @entity25 counterparts , and a @entity22 representative visited @entity0 as envoys underscored the need to lower the temperature in the longtime flash - point region , days after four @entity1 died when @entity15 shelled @entity20			1
@entity15 said the @entity1 provoked the tuesday attack because shells from a @entity1 military drill landed in the @entity15 's waters			1
@entity1 was holding its annual @entity36 military drill when the @entity15 started its shelling , and the @entity1 returned fire			1
@entity15 's official @entity39 on saturday slammed @entity1 and the @entity3 for provoking the crisis			1
it called reports of civilian casualties part of @entity1 's " propaganda campaign " and accused the " enemy " of creating " a human shield by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation			2
" " if the @entity3 brings its carrier to the @entity58 at last , no one can predict the ensuing consequences , " said @entity39 , referring to the aircraft carrier @entity52 , which is set to join @entity1 's forces near the coasts of @entity22 and @entity15 for the four - day military drill scheduled to start sunday			1
@entity61 spokeswoman @entity60 called the claims " outrageous			2
" " this is just another example of @entity15 's own internal propaganda			2
the @entity15 for many years , including the @entity66 warship incident , have taken provocative action			0
this did n't have anything to do with @entity3 actions , " @entity60 told @entity2 , referring to the sinking of a @entity1 ship in march that left 46 people on board dead			1
the @entity3 and @entity1 blame the sinking on the @entity15 , which has consistently denied responsibility			1
diplomats , seeking a lessening of tensions and a return to the six - party talks with @entity15 over the country 's nuclear aspirations , busily labored to avert more hostilities			1
the @entity3 , @entity22 , @entity25 , @entity24 , @entity1 and @entity15 are the six countries that have been involved in the talks , which were put on hold in 2008			1
" these parties should call on the @entity15 and @entity1 to exercise calmness and restraint and hold dialogue and make contacts , and not to take actions that would escalate the conflict , " @entity22 's official @entity88 news agency quoted @entity22 foreign minister @entity89 as saying			1
@entity22 is @entity15 's largest trading partner			1
@entity89 and @entity24 foreign minister @entity100 " stressed the need to prevent the situation from exacerbating and to work toward relieving the tensions , " according to the @entity101			0
@entity88 reported that @entity25 foreign minister @entity102 said his country " is willing to work together with @entity22 to joint safeguard peace and stability on the @entity7			0
" and a @entity107 message from @entity61 spokesman @entity108 said secretary of state @entity109 spoke with @entity89 on friday and " encouraged @entity110 to make clear that @entity15 's behavior is unacceptable			0
" meanwhile , @entity112 , a @entity22 state councilor , sat down with @entity1 foreign minister @entity113 in @entity0 to discuss the tensions			1
the violence has sparked anger and political turmoil in @entity1			0
the country 's defense minister , @entity118 resigned after the exchange of fire , and veterans of the @entity1 military protested saturday on the streets of @entity0 , stating they were angry that their country 's government had not done enough to respond to the @entity128 's shelling			2
one group of protesters gathered near the defense ministry building saturday , clashing with police officers with some charging and kicking officers			0
two @entity1 marines were among the four killed in the shelling			0
hundreds of mourners attended their nationally televised funeral saturday , weeping before photos of the two men set among an array of flowers			0
as for sunday 's joint military exercises , @entity22 appeared to criticize them friday and @entity22 analysts warned against the @entity3 and @entity1 embarking on " sensitive and provocative military actions			1
" " we oppose any party to take any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission , " @entity148 spokesman @entity147 said in a statement , @entity88 reported			0
but the @entity3 has described the drill as defensive in nature			0
the exercises were planned months ago , and are meant to underscore strong ties between @entity1 and the @entity3 , defense officials from both countries have said			1
there will be no live firing element in the drills ; live firing exercises can only take place in a designated training range or in a closed - off area at sea , @entity169			0
@entity170 , public affairs officer for the @entity3 @entity172 , and such firing exercises are not possible given the amount of traffic in the area			2
the drills will include anti-air attack and anti-surface - attack exercises , communications and data drills , expert exchanges , logistical support , and replenishment drills			0
for example , a @entity1 oil tanker will refuel a @entity3 ship , @entity170 said			2
but the prospect of more violence has prompted alarm across the region			0
@entity25 's @entity192 news agency reported that @entity25 " @entity194 members have been ordered to stay in @entity195 until wednesday and be at their ministry offices within an hour in the event emergency situations develop			0
" @entity1 said thursday that it will strengthen its rules of engagement in the @entity8			0
@entity1 marine forces based in five islands near @entity15 and the disputed @entity205 also will be reinforced , a government spokesman said			2
the tense maritime border between the two @entity14 has become the major military flash point on the @entity7 in recent years			0
the @entity20 attack was the first direct artillery assault on @entity1 since 1953 , when an armistice ended fighting , though both @entity14 are still technically at war			2
journalist @entity213 and @entity2 's @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
