@entity0 , @entity1 -- more oil than what would fill an @entity6 - sized swimming pool slipped by the cap on @entity9 's ruptured undersea well due to bad weather on friday , said @entity11 rear adm. @entity11			1
the cap on the well in the @entity14 , bouncing in the rough conditions , captured 20,000 barrels ( 840,000 gallons ) fewer than anticipated , @entity11 said			1
bad weather has also prevented skimming or burning for the past two days , displaced boom and made it unsafe to fly , he said			2
crews are standing by to resume skimming operations and survey inland waterways that may have seen impacts due to a storm surge			0
@entity25 cleanup operations continue with limited weather interruption			0
for the 12 - hour period from noon thursday until midnight , approximately 9,515 barrels of oil were collected and about 4,150 barrels of oil and 28.6 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared			2
thursday 's total oil recovered was approximately 25,150 barrels			2
high winds account for the cap 's " wobble , " said @entity36 , a @entity9 spokesman			2
he noted that forecasters expect rough seas to calm a bit this weekend			0
the oil is more likely to move east than west along the coastline and , if it rides on the @entity42 , could reach the southwestern @entity44 coast in a degraded form , the @entity46 said in a report released friday			1
the @entity42 flows northward between @entity48 and @entity51 's @entity50 peninsula into the @entity14 , then u-turns and flows out between @entity48 and @entity44 into the @entity53			1
@entity46 predicts that there 's up to an 80 percent that the @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 will be affected by the disaster , depending on the weather conditions , currents and recovery efforts			0
it would reach the shore in the form of tar balls or weathered patches -- not as a slick			0
the western side of @entity44 is highly unlikely to be hit , @entity46 projected			2
@entity68 whipped up strong winds and waves before it made landfall in northeastern @entity51 late wednesday night			0
with @entity68 fading , many in the @entity74 were hoping they could get back to cleaning up the massive oil spill			0
the dangerous storm had created choppy seas in the @entity14 and caused hundreds of oil skimmers to be docked			0
" we had to stand down because of the storm activity			0
now that oil has been spewed all over the @entity85 , " @entity82 , the president of @entity83 in @entity1 , said thursday			0
" we are going out again tomorrow to start cleaning it up			0
we have to go back out , basically start over			0
" newly retired @entity89 adm. @entity88 announced friday that since june , the skimming capability in the @entity14 has increased more than fivefold -- from approximately 100 large skimmers to 550 skimming vessels of various sizes working to collect oil in all parts of the region as of @entity98 date , 28.2 million gallons of an oil - water mix has been skimmed from the @entity14 's surface			1
@entity25 cleanup operations continued friday with limited weather interruption			0
the administrator of the @entity103 , @entity104 , planned to tour parts of the @entity74 on friday , a day after her agency gave @entity9 a new directive on how to deal with the clean - up of the massive oil spill			1
@entity110 will hold a town hall meeting in @entity0 and tour areas of @entity113 , @entity44 , on friday , which is her sixth trip to the area since the april 20 oil disaster , the @entity103 said			1
on thursday , the @entity103 and the @entity89 issued a directive to @entity9 on how the company should manage recovered oil , contaminated materials and waste recovered in cleanup operations in the @entity14			1
among other requirements , the directive requires the oil giant to give the @entity103 and state agencies access to any waste storage site and to provide specific plans , waste reports and tracking systems for liquid and solid waste			1
" while the states of @entity1 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity44 are overseeing @entity9 's waste management activities and conducting inspections , this action today is meant to complement their activities by providing further oversight and imposing more specific requirements , " the @entity89 said thursday			1
" under the directive , @entity103 , in addition to sampling already being done by @entity9 , will begin sampling the waste to help verify that the waste is being properly managed			1
" waste sampling to date has been done in compliance with @entity103 and state regulatory requirements , the @entity89 said			1
researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels ( about 1.5 million gallons ) and 60,000 barrels ( about 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have been gushing into the @entity14 every day since april 20 , when the @entity153 rig exploded and sank off the coast of @entity1 .			2

new : *containment* cap bounced , allowing 20,000 barrels to get by
new : skimming and burning halted , @entity89 says
new : @entity42 could *deposit* degraded oil on @entity44 coast
@entity103 toured coast friday after giving @entity9 new cleanup directive
