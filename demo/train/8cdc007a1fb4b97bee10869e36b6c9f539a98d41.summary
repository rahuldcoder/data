-- @entity1 stared at the picture that popped up on his @entity4 feed			1
he felt like the floor was opening up and swallowing him whole			2
this photo of himself had been taken a few days earlier at a 2009 @entity8 and posted by his friend @entity9			2
@entity1 was 386 pounds at the time , wearing size 60 pants , and holding a plate of food			1
he had known for a while that he was overweight and out of shape			2
but this guy ? he did n't recognize himself			2
" i do n't have a neck , i do n't have a lap ... i look like a swollen pig , " said @entity1 , now 42 years old			1
he thought : " why has n't someone just slapped me with something heavy and said ' you 're going to die -- you look awful ' ? " at first , the father of five in @entity23 felt overwhelmed with anger and shame			2
he wanted his friend to take down the picture			2
but when he cooled off , he knew it was his own responsibility to make a change			2
@entity1 , the manager of payment operations for a regional health plan , had made a career of managing processes , policies and procedures			1
his job involved thinking about how employees could do things better and more cost effectively , based on data and measurable results			2
@entity1 's @entity42 to 160 @entity43 he decided to apply those management concepts to his weight loss			1
he kept a journal tracking what worked for him , and by the end of three years , he had lost 158 pounds			1
@entity49 through , he began to chronicle his journey on the blog " 100 small steps , " and is currently trying to turn it into a book			1
here 's how @entity1 lost the weight : he did tons of research			1
as @entity1 first started his weight - loss quest , he joined a program that provided protein shakes and pre-made meals , but quickly realized " i did n't have the money or the desire to eat out of a box my entire life			1
" he read psychological journals , fitness blogs and books about weight loss to learn the underlying causes of obesity and proven strategies that worked for other people			1
one book was " @entity78 to lead , " which looks at the connection between fitness and productivity			2
learning how depression and obesity may affect each other made @entity1 serious about losing weight and getting help			1
counseling helped him confront past disappointments , make peace with the fact that he had n't fulfilled his dream of becoming an opera singer , and find healthier things to do when he felt stressed or upset			2
" i really did n't like who i had become			2
i had to learn how to fall in love with that person again , " he said			2
" i wrote down all the things i did n't like about myself and i wrote all the things i liked ... i had to learn how to like that person , and want to do things to stop abusing that person			0
" he kept reminders all around			0
that picture from @entity8 that made him sick ? he put it up all over his house , laid a copy on the passenger seat of his car and made it the home screen on his phone			0
he showed the photo to anyone who would listen as a way of keeping himself accountable as he lost weight			1
" i looked for opportunities to talk about it , to share my story with other people			2
that 's my reminder all the time			0
that 's me -- that 's who i was -- and i do n't ever want to go back there			0
" he ditched his credit card			0
@entity1 , who spends a lot of time on the road , realized that he 'd be more mindful about his food purchases if he stopped using plastic			1
he put himself on daily cash rations -- $ 10 for breakfast and lunch -- and found he was a lot more likely to buy food that was truly " fuel " instead of junk			0
he turned off the tv			0
after a hunting trip with some buddies , it dawned on him that snow pants , boots and warm socks made it a lot more enjoyable to stay outside , even in the cold @entity23 winter			0
when he got home , he took the family shopping for sweaters , warm gloves and other gear so they could spend more time outside and less time watching movie marathons and eating popcorn			0
" i knew we were finally doing it right when someone asked me about a popular tv show and i had no idea what they were talking about , " he wrote			0
@entity1 initially was too embarrassed about his body to go to the gym , and when he did , he found his stomach was so large that it physically hurt to use the machines			1
but there were lots of exercises he could do at home : @entity170 push - ups , jumping jacks , deep knee bends , situps and other sweat - breaking routines			1
now that he 's thinner , he uses the gym at his office about three times a week but still does calisthenics every day at home			0
he only ate while sitting at the table , had a salad before each meal , and chewed each bite at least 20 times			0
@entity1 learned another trick to curb his cravings : brushing his teeth right afterward , when he was most likely to long for a honey bun -- his @entity192 ' heel			1
" trust me when i tell you , honey buns and @entity195 do n't mix , " he said			0
he did n't deprive himself			0
after several months of avoiding all the foods that were bad for him , @entity1 said he realized he was obsessed about honey buns , cheese puffs and all the willpower - busting snacks he could n't have			1
once he allowed himself cheat days , the cravings went away			0
he is careful about what he eats most of the time , and in fact , he earned the nickname " @entity206 " because he was always talking about treating his body like a temple			0
still , he allows himself one special meal a week			0
he also practices restraint by putting cheese puffs in a tea cup for portion control , or eating half a candy bar and wrapping up the rest for another time			0
@entity1 's openness about his journey has inspired a lot of people in his life , including his boss , @entity222 , who hired him when he was halfway through his weight loss			1
she herself has battled the bulge and lost 50 pounds			1
" we 've talked about recipes that eliminate fat , or spices that you can add that are n't salt , " @entity222 said			0
" i have a tendency to beat myself up if i stepped backwards , and he says , ' it 's a new day			0
' " @entity1 's friend @entity235 , who posted that @entity8 picture on @entity4 , says he never thought of @entity237 as obese			1
but he 's not surprised that @entity1 succeeded in his transformation			1
" he 's definitely faced many challenges in his life since i 've known him			0
i 've watched him own his own business and the challenge that presents ... having that many mouths to feed on a daily basis , having to pay all those bills , and he makes it happen , " @entity235 said			0
" i knew there would be results			0
there 's no doubt that he would conquer it			0
" since his initial 158 - pound weight loss , @entity1 says he put on about 10 pounds of muscle			1
now at 6 feet tall and 238 pounds , with a 40 - inch waist , he knows he still has some work to do but is much happier about how he looks and feels			1
he knew he had turned a corner when he wrote in his journal a year ago : " 5:15 p.m. : really craving a honey bun ... 5:45 p.m. : honey buns are overrated ! " he has n't had a honey bun since			0
