@entity0 , @entity1 -- his is one of the most famous faces in the world -- a symbol of dignity and reconciliation for many			0
those protecting @entity11 's image want him remembered as more than just a face on a t - shirt but those now trying to protect his image say @entity11 is also in danger of becoming an exploited brand , emblazoned on clothing , smiling from unauthorized paintings and commemorated in a proliferation of tacky memorabilia			1
" what we do n't want is for him to become another @entity29 , another face on a t - shirt , " says @entity23 , head of the @entity24 , which organizes charitable projects on behalf of the former @entity1 president			2
@entity23 and the @entity24 have been aggressive in clamping down on what they say is an illegal use of @entity11 's image			1
artist @entity35 , one of 200 people worldwide who have been warned against exploiting the @entity39 laureate 's iconic status , says the foundation is being heavy handed			1
" the people around him , trying to protect him , are being overprotective			2
he is widely regarded as the father of freedom now , yet we are not allowed to depict his image , " he says			2
problems protecting @entity11 's image stand in contrast to the 27 years he spent in prison when photographs of him were outlawed , althought this did n't stop him becoming a poster star of overseas anti-apartheid campaigns			1
but playing policeman is not just about protecting his image from overexposure , says @entity59 , archivist with the @entity60			1
" @entity61 is not something you receive in pristine form and your role is to hold it over time			0
we believe legacy is made , constantly remade , " he says			0
the foundation says it is aware that @entity11 will exist as a brand long after he is gone			1
but it says it wants to make sure he 's instantly remembered as a man who helped changed history -- a man whose qualities of reconciliation , forgiveness and hope can be emulated by all			0
" for us , our role is about fostering that process			0
@entity1 has a stake in that legacy			0
arguably , the world has a stake in that legacy , " says @entity59 " it 's not about ownership -- custody -- but creating spaces for this to continue growing			0
