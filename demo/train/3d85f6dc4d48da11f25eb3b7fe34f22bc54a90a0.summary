@entity0 -- more than a month after @entity4 militants from @entity5 massacred 67 people at a mall in @entity8 , a @entity0 rapid response team has now been deployed to the northeastern border of the country to secure the closed border crossing into neighboring @entity4			1
but official border crossings are far from the only routes into @entity4			1
branching brazenly off from government roads are panya routes or " rat routes " -- paths hacked out of the undergrowth that are used by smugglers to cross back and forth between @entity0 and @entity4 undetected			1
they 're certainly a smoother ride than the official roads -- and in spite of the @entity0 government 's efforts to beef up border security after the @entity29 attack , we see no government presence as we cruise down the trail			1
traveling on these smugglers ' routes , we 've managed to enter @entity4 from @entity0 without showing any @entity34 , without going through any checkpoints , and without going through any kind of a security process			1
nighttime is rush hour on the panya routes			0
people and goods are ferried back and forth , but everyone is too afraid to stop for long here , even to help the stranded families we see along the way			0
many are escaping the uncertainty back home in @entity4 , but some are seeking to enter @entity0 undetected for other reasons			1
the panya routes end in @entity0 at the world 's largest refugee camp			2
@entity4 refugees have long fled to the @entity57 camp , and it is currently the target of the @entity0 government 's @entity61 ire			1
hiding among refugees authorities believe that during the build - up to the @entity29 siege , @entity5 operatives traveled from @entity4 through the panya routes and hid among the refugees in the camp in northeast @entity0			1
it 's from there , @entity0 authorities say , that the operatives , hiding in plain sight , made their way through government checkpoints with other undocumented migrants and then deeper into @entity0			2
my colleague and i board one of the many buses carrying people from @entity57 to @entity8 and ask the conductor how much the fare is			0
two tickets cost about $ 12 , but the price skyrockets when we tell him we do n't have legal documentation to be in @entity0			2
the conductor says $ 230 will buy us the use of fake @entity0 ids and a safe trip			2
we do n't need the @entity34 , but others on the bus do			0
" do n't worry , " he says			0
" we count out the cash and he hands us ids from a stash he 's been handing out on the bus			0
that 's all it takes			0
as we arrive at @entity107 , the main town in eastern @entity0 , passengers line up at the checkpoint			2
security officers scrutinize thumbprints with the help of a magnifying glass , comparing them against the fake ids			0
we overhear one woman take a police officer aside and tell him bluntly she that does n't have valid papers			0
everyone , including the woman , is waved back on to the bus and on their way to the country 's capital			0
i show my official documentation -- not the fake ids we purchased -- and join them			0
vetting challenges @entity0 interior minister @entity130 acknowledges the challenge posed by police officers who willfully ignore obviously fake ids for migrants , and says his department is committed to stamping out the problem			1
a new vetting process will remove corrupt officials from the system , according to @entity130			2
he says : " people are noticing that there 's a new requirement for service in terms of integrity and that those who will not meet that threshold will not be allowed into their service			0
" the @entity0 - @entity4 border is roughly 780 kilometers -- that 's a very long border			1
it is a major security concern for us because the points of entry are far too many but definitely as a country we , with our defense forces in @entity4 , one of the areas that they 're supposed to look after is to take care of that border			2
what we are working on is a surveillance system using technology that will be able to show us what is happening in the entire borderline			1
" repatriation deal in the meantime , the @entity0 government has signed a voluntary repatriation agreement with @entity4 and the @entity170 that will provide support for @entity4 who wish to return to their country			1
the goal is to reduce numbers at the @entity57 refugee camp , where @entity0 officials believe some security threats may originate			0
@entity130 says : " remember , the process is voluntary , but again the @entity179 has confirmed that the areas [ in @entity4 ] these people are relocating back to are safe			1
" it 's a win - win , taking away the heavy burden that came in terms of our security because criminals unfortunately have taken advantage of that hospitality to carry [ out ] criminal activities not only in the camps but to plan for them in the country			0
" but as long as the traffic continues to flow across the many rat routes on the border -- and when a fake identity is only one simple transaction away -- will repatriating a few @entity4 refugees be enough to protect @entity0 ? ' ruthless leader ' aims to extend reach of @entity5 former spy : @entity0 mall attack ' could have been prevented '			1

" @entity206 " routes are used by smugglers to cross between @entity0 and @entity4
some are escaping uncertainty in @entity4 -- others seeking to enter @entity0 undetected for other reasons
@entity0 interior minister @entity130 acknowledges the challenges
he says they are working on a new surveillance system
