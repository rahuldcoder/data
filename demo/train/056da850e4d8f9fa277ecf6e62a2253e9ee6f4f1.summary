in late january , @entity0 , a seventeen - year - old woman with bipolar disorder and depression , walked into the police department in @entity5 , @entity6 , with " i have a gun " written on her hand			1
she also had a knife in her waistband			1
officer @entity12 approached her , read her message , and quickly restrained her			2
he then let her go , restrained her on the floor , then let her go again as two other officers entered the scene			2
on the surveillance video that the department released , you can see the moment in which @entity0 decides to die			1
she raises her knife and charged at @entity12 , who shoots , as does one of the other officers			1
the third officer deploys a @entity25 , but by then it was too late			0
she lies on the floor for a few minutes until emergency medical services arrive			0
the department has released a statement and held a press conference			0
the officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation by the @entity36			0
when police misread the circumstances of encounter with an individual with mental health crisis , the possibility for violence rapidly escalates			1
the only solution is for law enforcement to try to stabilize every encounter , to the extent possible , as if it involved psychiatric disability			1
as a nation , we are in the midst of an extended conversation about police violence , and this case stands out as unusual			1
the victim was white and female , for one thing			0
moreover , ugly use - of - force incidents usually result from police being too quick to escalate , rather than too slow			2
in the last few years i 've watched many videos , either from cell phones or police cameras , and read even more incident reports describing encounters between law enforcement and people with psychiatric disabilities			1
i can not recall seeing a case in which an officer has a potentially violent individual so well subdued , and then just backs away			0
i wondered if just as being black and male sparks some officers to be overly aggressive , a confrontation with a slender white female might produce the opposite effect			0
the best known victims of police violence while in mental health crisis are black men			1
police arguably are more prone to consider black men dangerous			1
they demand instant compliance and respond to any hesitation as a threat			0
for example , in cases such as the death of @entity89 in @entity90 , or @entity91 in @entity92 , police officers engaged aggressively , demanding the individual act in a non-disabled manner and comply			2
in my review of such encounters , i 've argued that @entity89 , @entity91 , and many other individuals in similar circumstances , could n't follow orders as expected			2
therefore , they were shot and killed			2
these are cases of law enforcement officers failing to recognize the complexity of a mental health situation			1
in @entity108 , @entity6 , on the other hand , the incident shows the other side of the coin -- under aggression			0
i spoke to @entity113 , a police officer and a trainer for use - of - force incidents , he said that in his experience many officers are likely to be less aggressive toward women , especially small women , in ways that put everyone in greater danger			2
" generally speaking , male officers are more reluctant to use lawful , justified , and necessary levels of force against women as compared to incidents with men			0
" he also said that use - of - force models for a suspect armed with a knife , but restrained , might differ			2
hypothetically , @entity113 says that if he could control a suspect 's arms , he would not let her free from the restraint hold , but that if he feared he might lose control , backing up and readying his firearm might be a reasonable choice			0
at this time officer @entity12 is not speaking about his decision - making , due to the ongoing investigation , so i do n't know why he did n't try to handcuff her			0
i expect the investigation to determine that he was operating within the norms of his training for use - of - force			0
there 's no question that using a firearm and aiming for center mass is the correct response for someone at close proximity charging you with a butcher knife raised			1
it 's just not the only way to handle these situations			0
for example , in @entity92 recently , a man with a butcher knife charged at police officers			1
they held their fire , remembering the death of @entity91 , and instead led him in a chase around parked cars , shouting at him to drop his knife , and simply waited until he eventually complied			2
that 's a model of tactical restraint that we need to see applied more broadly			0
encounters between people with psychiatric disabilities and law enforcement can be dangerous			1
studies estimate that around half the people killed by law enforcement every year have psychiatric disabilities such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder			1
there will always be some situations in which the threat level is so great that there 's no way to stabilize it peacefully			0
but the death of @entity0 was not one of them			1
her death demonstrates that the ongoing crisis of violent police encounters with people with mental health transcends race , class and gender			1
it requires fundamental rethinking of strategic approaches to these types of incidents on a national level			0
until that happens , the unnecessary deaths will continue .			0

@entity0 , who had mental illness , was killed after she raised knife and charged at police
