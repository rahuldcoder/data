@entity0 , @entity1 -- emergency services and @entity1 military personnel stepped up the search friday for dozens of people still missing in @entity7 as authorities and residents tried to assess the damage caused by the state 's worst flooding in decades			1
one of the 15 bodies recovered was found 80 kilometers from where the person had been washed away , said @entity7 police commissioner @entity16			1
some bodies might never be recovered , he said			2
floodwaters that carved a muddy trail of destruction through @entity0 , the state capital , have started to recede , but officials warn the cleanup will take months			1
more than 20,000 homes were inundated after the normally subdued @entity24 turned into a raging torrent as weeks of rain pushed it to more than 4 meters at high tide early thursday			1
@entity30 @entity29 fought back tears as she described the damage inflicted by the state 's " worst natural disaster in our history			1
" the search was concentrated to the west of @entity0 , near @entity39 , which was all but submerged when a wall of water tore through the town on monday			1
" there has to be an expectation of further deaths and further bodies			2
... we have to steel ourselves for that terrible outcome , " said @entity1 defence minister @entity47			2
residents in @entity0 were being urged not to enter floodwater because of the risk of illness after sewage plants along the river were inundated			1
sightseers were warned to stay clear of the @entity24 or risk hampering emergency service operations			2
some 200 people , including members of the @entity60 , @entity61 and police , searched vast tracts of land and swollen waters for 55 people still missing			1
prime minister @entity67 spoke to reporters at @entity69 outside @entity0 , where she was preparing to board a plane to tour the area			2
she said the number of @entity60 personnel deployed for rescue and cleanup work was being boosted to 1,200			2
that represents the biggest deployment of @entity60 personnel for a natural disaster since @entity80 devastated the northern @entity1 city of @entity82 on christmas eve 1974 , killing 71 people			2
aerial views of @entity0 showed islands of roofs and treetops jutting from a sea of muddy brown water -- or stranded high - rises jutting starkly from murky river overflow			2
the @entity24 , which slices through the city , peaked thursday at 4.6 meters ( more than 15 feet ) , about a meter below predictions and below the level set by the last major flood in 1974			2
officials had predicted a crest at 5.2 meters			1
@entity29 said 11,900 homes in @entity0 were fully flooded and 14,700 were partially flooded			1
in addition , about 2,500 businesses were fully inundated and 2,500 more were partially inundated , she said			1
many of them will never again be habitable , she said			2
" there 's a lot of heartache and grief as people start to see , for the first time , what has happened to their homes and their streets , " @entity29 told @entity104			1
" in some cases , we have street after street where every home has been inundated to the roof level			1
" @entity7 police have arrested 10 people on 18 charges of looting , @entity16 said			0
nine of the incidents were in @entity0 and one in @entity127			0
if convicted , offenders could face up to 10 years in prison			0
some 600 members of the @entity60 were helping and more were expected , said @entity29			1
she predicted that @entity0 's @entity131 was " largely operational , " and will likely be fully operational next week , when power is expected to be restored to 10 office buildings			1
the flooding in @entity0 follows flooding elsewhere in the state			0
soon after @entity138 , water from torrential rains swamped the northern city of @entity140 , 600 kilometers ( 370 miles ) north of @entity0 , triggering a massive recovery operation to rebuild the town			0
those floodwaters have been sweeping toward the coasts since then			0
so far , 70 towns and cities in @entity7 have been affected by the flood , @entity29 said			1
homeowners who had evacuated their properties started returning thursday to assess the damage			0
some rowed out on inflatable boats , surfboards and whatever else they could find			0
one man was seen walking in the murky water up to his chin			0
@entity156 reached his @entity158 property , in central @entity0 , by kayak			0
" i 've got a couple of thousand dollars worth of surfboards under the house and we 'd left the garage door open to avoid structural damage to the house and i wanted to get them before they floated out to sea , " he said after paddling back to higher ground in his street , which was smeared with mud and littered with flood - damaged furniture			0
he , his wife and three children abandoned their home on tuesday evening after the water rose 1 meter inside their garage			0
by late thursday , the brown , murky water had risen more than half a meter above the second floor			0
the depth of the water surprised him			0
" we 'd been advised by the council that the building height we built at was a meter above the 1974 floods when in fact it 's quite a bit below the 1974 floods , " he said			1
" it 's only now that we 've worked that out			1
" farther down the street , @entity195 walked down her driveway , where sodden mattresses were piled on a muddy armchair and tv			0
she and her husband had been staying in the nearby hostel her husband manages , but abandoned it for the main flood evacuation center at the @entity206			0
they were among more than 1,000 people who slept wednesday night on inflatable mattresses at the center			0
numbers are expected to fall in coming days as people find alternative accommodations			0
" we 've been coming back and forward just to check " on the hostel , @entity214 said			0
" it 's not as bad as we expected			1
" but many others were n't so lucky			0
elsewhere in the city , floodwater rose to rooftops , submerging houses and creating a logistical and financial headache for homeowners waiting for the water to drop so they could check the damage			0
@entity2 's @entity227 contributed to this report .			1
