-- there is a lot of excitement around the potential of " stereoscopic " movies ( " @entity6 " to you and me )			1
much of it has been drummed up by director @entity11 's forthcoming blockbuster " @entity10 " and @entity13 boss @entity12 , who is releasing more than a dozen @entity6 pictures this year			1
the title character looks over a note from her " other parents " in " @entity19			1
" after seeing " @entity23 " and " @entity24 , " two recent entries in the @entity6 sweepstakes , it was easy to conclude that this fad would n't last any longer than it did last time around , in the 1950s			1
but after seeing the captivating " @entity19 , " the first stereoscopic stop - motion animated feature , i 've changed my mind			1
maybe this really is the next phase for motion pictures -- and what 's more , maybe that 's not such a bad thing			2
in the hands of " @entity36 " director @entity37 , @entity6 is n't a gimmick or the ocular equivalent of an obstacle course			1
it 's an aesthetic enhancement , layering the story and literally bringing depth and texture to the visuals			0
adapted by @entity37 from @entity47 's novella ( the same @entity47 who co-scripted " @entity23 , " incidentally ) , " @entity19 " is a contemporary fairy tale about a bored , blue - haired 11 - year - old kicking around a big old house in rainy , empty @entity52			1
they basically leave her to her own devices , so when @entity19 ( voiced by @entity57 ) discovers a diminutive door hidden behind the wallpaper , her mom ( @entity56 ) agrees to fish out the key , revealing ... a brick wall			1
it 's only at night , when she dreams , that the door magically opens to a tunnel , and @entity19 passes through to the house next door : a fabulous mirror image of her own home , right down to an identical mom and dad			1
identical , except that these parents give her pancakes , presents and their full attention			0
that , and the buttons stitched into their skulls where their eyes should be			0
any parent will immediately recognize that this " other mother " and " other father " are too good to be true ( they 're prettier and more talented , and they obviously do n't work for a living ) , but @entity19 is entranced by the dazzling , super-saturated night - world , with its garden of snapping dragons , a circus of performing mice and all the treats she can eat			1
in her dreams , the grass is n't just greener -- it 's emerald			0
in one of @entity37 's embellishments on the novel , there 's a facsimile of the only other child in the valley			0
he 's an irritating boy named @entity103 , who 's very much improved in his all - smiling , mute incarnation , in @entity19 's opinion			1
at least until he musters up a scowl ... @entity37 's movie can be intense and even disturbing ; it could easily freak out impressionable adults , let alone their offspring			2
but i prefer to think of it as a feel - good movie for overworked parents			2
there 's also a redoubtable talking cat ( voiced by @entity116 ) to ensure that everything will come out all right			0
tapping into primal fantasies and fears , the film also echoes classic fantasy stories from the @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity125 @entity124			0
the tunnel suggests the rabbit hole @entity128 fell down , and the crazy mirror manner in which the " other " world reflects back on reality reminds us of the doubling of actors in the film version of @entity136 " @entity19 " is n't perfect			2
i could have done without either the downstairs neighbors -- two elderly showgirls -- or the acrobatic @entity139 barker upstairs ( a little carny goes a long way )			0
but the whimsy is always offset with comic mischief and the menace of @entity56 's genuinely creepy other mother			0
the model work is extraordinary in its eccentric , jury - rigged genius			0
a shower spouts rusty water -- fabricated from plastic , apparently			0
and if you examine the blooms in other father 's garden too closely , you might see they have been fashioned from popcorn			0
you ca n't taste it -- not yet -- but in its @entity6 incarnation ( about half the movie 's release prints will be in traditional 2 - d ) , you 'll feel you could reach out and touch			1
with an dreamily sinister and seductive score by @entity163 , " @entity19 " never stops taking artistic risks			2
i hope there 's a brave enough audience out there willing to take the plunge			0
" @entity19 " runs 100 minutes and is rated @entity171 's take , click here .			2

" @entity19 " makes the most of its @entity6 -- and its clever , creative *storytelling*
movie is based on @entity47 story about girl who finds new set of parents
" @entity19 " is intense but also whimsical and *wonderful*
