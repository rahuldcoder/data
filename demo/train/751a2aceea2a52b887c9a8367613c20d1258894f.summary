the clear waters around @entity1 are as picturesque as you can imagine , and the brilliantly colored fish swimming around are like something from a crayon box			1
but a serious problem lurks behind the beautiful facade : the lionfish			1
lionfish are not native to the @entity10			1
the venomous , fast reproducing fish are aggressive eaters and will consume anything and everything , gorging so much they are actually getting liver disease			1
with no known predators -- except human beings -- they can wipe out 90 % of a reef			2
" the lionfish invasion is probably the worst environmental disaster the @entity10 will ever face , " said @entity21 , president and founder of @entity23 , which works with the government and research agencies to help reduce the lionfish population in @entity1			1
while the problem is only beginning to escalate , many in the marine preservation field are already concerned for the marine life that surrounds the lionfish			1
ecologist @entity34 with the @entity35 said that while this may not be the worst epidemic the @entity10 has faced , it does have the makings of a disaster			1
he said the lionfish has brought a " big change in biodiversity , " and it is what he called " the most abundant top - level predator on some coral reefs ( in the @entity10 )			1
" lionfish were first recorded decades ago and their population has grown quickly			1
they produce 30,000 to 40,000 eggs every few days and are sexually mature by 1 year old			2
today , you can find them throughout the @entity54 , the @entity55 , the @entity56 and in the waters along @entity58			2
invasive species : eat them before they eat everything as a non-indigenous species , lionfish are especially dangerous to the ecosystem because fish in the @entity10 lack a native instinct to stay away from them			1
how did they get there ? ask @entity71			0
@entity71 pet owners are blamed for their release into unfamiliar waters			0
believe it or not , dna evidence traces all lionfish in the @entity10 back to only six to eight female lionfish			1
scientists will tell you it 's up to humans , the fish 's only known predator , to save the ecosystem			1
i recently joined @entity21 and his team to get a front - row view into a lionfish hunt			1
an underwater scheme of this nature requires all the right technology , both to capture the scene visually and for the body to survive extreme depths			0
to get 200 feet beneath the surface , @entity21 and team had to use rebreathers , which are far more advanced and require more training than your typical tank			0
we had three @entity105 3 cameras ( the waterproof housing works up to 197 feet ) , with two on head mounts and one on a pole			0
there were also two @entity112 cameras that can go up to 250 feet , and several @entity113 , which go up to 130 feet			0
to approach the proper depths at a fast speed , the team clips in to @entity118 scooters , which can move divers 250 feet per minute , allowing them to cover more ground			0
' @entity121 ' now ? it 's a lot of work to capture all this on video , but the documentation is in high demand			0
the footage is critical because it allows researchers deep insights into the behavior of the lionfish and contributes to the database of information they 're building			1
the team also collects gps coordinates and fish counts , notes the number of species observed , surveys the stomach contents of each fish captured and more			1
they can determine if culling an area or hot spot makes a difference 30 days later			0
" scientists are scrambling for the data , " said @entity21			1
these dives are made more complicated by something called " bottom time			0
" at deeper dives of 200 feet , these highly trained divers can only stay down for about 25 minutes before they run out of air and decompress their bodies			0
it 's never enough time			0
at this depth , lionfish in @entity1 are everywhere , and the team caught 16 before they hit the time limit			2
then it was my turn			2
i joined the guys on a 100 - foot dive , spears in hand , to get the real experience ( spear guns are illegal in @entity1 waters so we had to use a hand - operated elastic type of spear )			0
despite our weapons , i was shocked to see the lionfish just sit there			2
it seemed to be baiting us , " come on hit me			0
" with 18 venomous spines and no predators , it does have a reason to be fearless			2
across @entity1 , residents are also doing their part to try to take control of the lionfish population			1
there are lionfish tournaments and fish fries , and you can see " eat ' em to beat ' em " t - shirts throughout the island			1
to experts like @entity21 , these movements may not be enough			0
" it 's an infestation , " @entity34 said over the phone			0
" the @entity10 is a big place , but the areas being affected are extremely important			1
" i do n't know if we can stop the lionfish invasion			2
this is n't a battle we can win , we can only maintain , " he said			0
" human beings started this problem			0
it is our fault they are here			0
we have to take responsibility and try to fix or hope we can control it			0
" 2012 : taming the lionfish - @entity71 fights back against invasive species			2

lionfish are invading the @entity10 , reproducing quickly and consuming local fish
scientists predict this could turn into an environmental disaster
to curb the booming population , *people* are hunting and eating the *prickly* venomous fish
