@entity0 will begin manufacturing a computer in the @entity2 next year , says ceo @entity3 , marking a shift in perhaps the most - criticized element of the company 's beloved gadget empire			1
" we 've been working for years on doing more and more in the @entity2 , " @entity3 said in an interview with @entity9 on @entity11 's " @entity10 , " scheduled to air thursday night			1
" next year , we will do one of our existing @entity16 lines in the @entity2			2
" @entity3 did not say which computer he was talking about , but some models of the new @entity19 have been arriving stamped " @entity22 in the @entity2 , " prompting speculation that it may be the company 's flagship desktop			1
an @entity0 spokesman told @entity24 that @entity0 will be investing $ 100 million in the move			1
he downplayed the @entity19 speculation , though , saying @entity0 has always done some assembly of its computers in the @entity2 and calling the stamps on some 21 - inch @entity19 " coincidental as part of this story			1
" @entity3 shelled out additional details in an interview with @entity34			2
he said @entity0 would not necessarily be the manufacturer of these computer components , " but we 'll be working with people , and we 'll be investing our money			1
" in recent years @entity0 has come under sometimes withering criticism for its supply chain in @entity41 , both for shipping @entity2 jobs overseas and for the working conditions at plants run by the companies @entity0 contracts with there			1
former @entity0 ceo @entity48 , who died last year , avoided addressing the supply chain issue in public			1
but @entity3 has taken a different tack			0
he visited @entity41 in march to tour a factory owned by @entity53 , which makes electronics for @entity0 and other companies			1
and he allowed the @entity56 to do a thorough audit of conditions at the @entity41 factories , vowing to improve pay and hours			2
@entity3 told @entity11 that @entity0 is n't concerned about the higher cost of manufacturing in the @entity2 creating pressure to raise prices			1
@entity0 assembled many of its products in the @entity2 until the late 1990s , when it exported that work to @entity68 where labor costs are lower			2
" it 's not so much about price , it 's about the skills , etc. , " he told @entity11 's @entity9			0
" over time , there are skills that are associated with manufacturing that have left the @entity2			0
not necessarily people , but the education system has just stopped producing that			0
it 's a concerted effort to get them back			0
" @entity3 acknowledged to @entity34 that the move is influenced , at least in part , by a desire to bolster a @entity2 unemployment rate that , while slowly rebounding , still hovers around 8 %			1
" i do n't think we have a responsibility to create a certain kind of job , " @entity3 said			0
" but i think we do have a responsibility to create jobs			0
" in both interviews , @entity3 emphasized @entity2 jobs @entity0 has already helped create -- from the companies that make components of its popular @entity94 to the developers who have built businesses creating apps for @entity0 mobile devices			1
" the engine in here is made in @entity2 , " @entity3 said , holding up an @entity94			1
" and not only are the engines in here made in @entity2 , but engines are made in @entity2 and exported			2
the glass on this phone is made in @entity106			0
so , we 've been working for years on doing more and more in the @entity2			2
" as large as it may sound , a $ 100 million investment remains a relatively small chunk of @entity0 's estimated $ 120 billion cash on hand			1
it follows other limited steps by electronics companies			0
@entity0 's not the first major tech player to shift a portion of its manufacturing to the states			0
@entity119 , the world 's second - largest pc maker , announced in october that it 's starting a production line in @entity122 , creating 115 new jobs making laptops , desktops , tablets and other products			0
it 's scheduled to open early next year			0
and earlier this year , @entity128 began making its @entity130 media streamer at a @entity132 plant -- although that ill - fated device has had a rocky run			0
five months after it was unveiled , the @entity136 's page in the @entity138 store says it is " not for sale at this time			0
" late last year , an analysis by the @entity141 predicted that 2015 will be a " tipping point " when many tech industries will begin manufacturing in the @entity2			2
" a surprising amount of work that rushed to @entity41 over the past decade could soon start to come back -- and the economic impact could be significant , " said @entity145 , a senior partner and lead author of the analysis			2
" we 're on record predicting a @entity2 manufacturing renaissance starting by around 2015			0

@entity0 ceo @entity3 : @entity0 will start making a computer in the @entity2
the move next year will cost $ 100 million , @entity0 spokesman says
@entity0 has been criticized for working conditions at its factories in @entity41
