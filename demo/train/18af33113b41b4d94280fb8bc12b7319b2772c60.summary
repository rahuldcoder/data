-- the story of how i became a national figure in the media is widely known , but few people know what i actually did for the @entity7			2
i was a covert operations officer specializing in nuclear counter proliferation -- essentially , making sure the bad guys did n't get the bomb			1
my job was to create and run operations that sought to peer into the procurement networks and acquisition chains of rogue nations			0
it was intense , tactical , creative and demanding			0
i believed that there was no more important work to be done			0
i resigned from the @entity7 in 2006 because it was no longer possible to do the covert work for which i was highly trained and which i loved			2
this happened because in 2003 , my covert identity was revealed in retaliation against my husband , ambassador @entity23 , who wrote an op - ed piece in which he accused the @entity25 of distorting the intelligence that was used to draw us into the @entity29 war			0
but i did not lose my belief that the danger of nuclear terrorism was the most urgent threat we face			2
nor did i lose my passion for working , albeit in a new way , to address that threat			0
i am working on this issue now as part of the international @entity40 movement , in which political , military and faith leaders , experts and activists strive for the worldwide elimination of all nuclear weapons			1
we know that terrorist groups have been trying to buy , build or steal a bomb			0
in the past two decades , there have been at least 25 instances of nuclear explosive materials being lost or stolen			2
there is enough highly enriched uranium , or @entity55 , in the world today to build more than 100,000 bombs			0
terrorists looking to buy or steal @entity55 could look to the approximately 40 countries with nuclear weapons materials			1
and then there are rogue individuals out there who are running black markets selling nuclear materials and technology			1
@entity68 's dr. @entity67 did it for years before my group at the @entity7 brought him down in december 2003 after catching him red - handed selling a full - scale nuclear bomb to @entity72 's regime in @entity73			1
if terrorists manage to get their hands on enough @entity55 , they could smuggle it into a target city , build a bomb and explode it			0
a hundred pounds of highly enriched uranium could fit in a shoebox , and 100,000 shipping containers come into the @entity84 every day			0
the nuclear threat is not limited to terrorism			2
there are also the dangers of proliferation and accidental or unauthorized nuclear launch			0
today , nine countries have more than 23,000 nuclear weapons , and the @entity84 and @entity93 still maintain thousands of nuclear weapons on hair - trigger alert , poised for launch within a few minutes			1
the only way to eliminate the danger that nuclear weapons will be used by countries in conflict , by accident or by terrorists is to lock down all nuclear materials and eliminate all nuclear weapons in all countries : global zero			1
today we have a real opportunity to set the course to global zero			0
@entity84 president @entity112 and @entity93 president @entity113 , whose countries have 22,000 nuclear weapons or 96 percent of the world 's stockpile , are signing an agreement to reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals by a third each			1
this is the most significant arms reduction treaty in two decades and a crucial first step			0
next week , @entity112 is hosting the leaders of 48 countries at a summit in @entity127 to address the global nuclear threat and initiate programs to secure all nuclear materials worldwide			1
with the @entity84 and @entity93 leading the way , 2010 could mark the beginning of the end of nuclear weapons			1
but achieving global zero will take years , a realistic plan of action and tremendous amounts of political will			0
in february , leaders of the @entity40 movement met in @entity142 , @entity143 , and outlined a step - by - step plan to eliminate all remaining nuclear weapons			1
the plan , backed by hundreds of former heads - of - state , foreign ministers , national security advisers and military commanders , calls in its first phase for the @entity84 and @entity93 to cut their arsenals to 1,000 total warheads each			0
all other countries with nuclear weapons would freeze their arsenals , and the international community would conduct an all - out global effort to block the further spread of nuclear weapons and to secure all nuclear materials			1
locking down nuclear bomb - making materials involves building secure facilities for storage , accounting for all stockpiles , guarding materials in transit ( transportation being the most vulnerable to terrorist attack and seizure ) , regulating exports , interdicting smuggling operations , ending production of new bomb materials and ultimately eliminating existing stockpiles			2
these steps would be followed by the first multilateral negotiations in history for reductions by all nuclear weapons countries			1
i 'm proud to be working with the @entity40 movement and its team of world leaders and grass - roots organizers , presidents and college kids			0
i want to do everything i can to raise public and political support for the elimination of nuclear weapons			1
and that is why i said yes when @entity193 , producer of " @entity194 , " " @entity195 " and " @entity196 , " asked me to be in an extraordinary and chilling documentary film , " @entity198 , " which premiered in january at the @entity200 to critical acclaim and will be released in @entity84 theaters in july			0
the film will be a stunning wake - up call to citizens and our political leaders about the urgent threats posed by nuclear weapons , including proliferation , nuclear terrorism and accidental nuclear launch			1
it will build awareness and support for the @entity40 movement to eliminate nuclear weapons			1
based on my experience in the field , i believe that if governments do n't act now to begin eliminating all remaining nuclear weapons , we will witness in our lifetime the use of the bomb by a country or terrorist group			1
to get governments to act , everyone needs to get involved , to make their voices heard , to bring this issue to the top of the political agenda , to everyone 's kitchen table and to the front pages of every blog and every newspaper			2
there is still time to change direction and set our course to global zero , but the clock is ticking			0
to learn more about the issue and get involved in the growing movement , go to globalzero.org and sign the declaration			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			2

@entity249 is a former @entity7 officer who worked to stop spread of nuclear materials
she says nuclear weapons and terrorism represent *no.* 1 threat faced right now
@entity249 says nations need to reduce nuclear arsenals and *tightly* control materials
if governments do n't act now , we will witness use of a bomb in our lifetime , she says
