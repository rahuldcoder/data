-- @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have ended in a flash of ruby - reds , turtlenecks and thigh - high boots			1
but what about @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 or @entity14 ? granted , these are n't cities where editors , buyers and bloggers from around the world flock to discover next season 's trends			1
but , regardless of what the @entity24 thinks of @entity27 's style sense , regional fashion weeks matter to the communities that host them -- and they 're starting to catch the attention of big - city fashion folk , too			1
after all , " not all designers are born and bred in @entity2 , @entity5 and @entity4 , " said @entity34 , who 's credited with creating @entity35 as we currently know it			1
after her success there , she helped launch and guide fashion weeks in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity14 as senior vice president of @entity45 in the 2000s			1
photos : @entity35 each year seems to herald the launch of a fashion week in a smaller , regional @entity52 city and , unlike their famous counterparts , runway shows are n't always the main event			1
@entity14 's schedule in may includes pop - up boutiques , wine and cheese parties and a screening of " @entity60 : the eye has to @entity62 , " a documentary about the influential fashion editor of @entity65 and editor - in - chief of @entity67			1
in april , @entity68 will offer a day of industry panels and several nights of runway shows featuring a mix of hometown heroes and established brands such as @entity75 and @entity76			1
yes , in some cities , the weeks are basically glorified business - boosting happy hours where flavored vodka drinks and rose flow liberally from local boutiques			1
there 's a bit of navel - gazing , to be sure			2
but , as @entity34 put it , what 's the harm in trying ? " regional fashion weeks are aspirational			1
i find something very refreshing and honest about them , " @entity34 said			1
" if the sidebar is that restaurants and hotels get a lot of business , even better			2
" the fashion industry is always looking for the next hot talent and you never know where you 'll find it			1
it 's a funny industry , where you need to be seen , and the best way for designers ' work to be seen is on the runway , wherever it is			1
" " project runway " season 11 contestant @entity108 credits her participation in @entity68 for the boost she needed to make the cut on the reality tv show			2
she earns a living as a stylist in @entity12 's entertainment industry while still cultivating her brand from a studio in the basement of her @entity12 home			2
but during fashion week , local organizers tend to provide models , hair and makeup services , saving designers like her thousands of dollars			1
@entity108 auditioned for " @entity129 " in 2009 but did n't make the final cut			2
after participating in @entity68 , she returned for auditions in 2012 with a portfolio of professional runway images and press clips lauding her work			2
" the exposure and press helps because it gives you an outside opinion that you can point to , " @entity108 said			2
" having the professional images and the ability to say ' i participated in a show ' also adds to your credibility			2
" designers to watch after @entity35 usually , runway shows distinguish the boozy shopping parties from events with the potential to propel young designers			1
a show in @entity12 , @entity151 , or @entity13 , @entity152 , can give designers a chance to shine or stumble -- without the intensely critical media eye that looms over @entity3 or @entity5			1
it just takes some time for a regional fashion week to grow from one to the other			1
@entity159 in @entity160 started out as a " chic party " in @entity165 and along @entity161 , where fashionistas hobnobbed over cocktails			1
in seven years , it has grown into an event that draws promising talent , industry heavyweights and thousands of attendees			1
last year , the event 's economic impact was $ 2.4 million , according to figures from the @entity174			2
the emerging designer competition is the event 's centerpiece			0
the nightly showdown began tuesday , whittling down a roster of 20 aspiring designers to five finalists , who sent their collections down the runway saturday night in a bid for the grand prize			1
the winner takes home $ 5,000 in cash , $ 10,000 in online marketing and promotional services , a book of professional runway images of the winning collection , and a sewing machine			0
prizes like that would certainly help semifinalist @entity196 , who makes a living doing custom alterations on a secondhand sewing machine in his @entity201 apartment			0
he 's also on call for tailoring jobs at a hotel he quit last month to free up time to work on his menswear collection			0
the tall - haired , @entity208 - born @entity201 transformed the living room of his @entity211 apartment into a workshop after being selected in december to participate in the contest			1
@entity214 at @entity35 his design idol is @entity217 , so naturally his collection is based on traditional menswear silhouettes with what he calls an " attention to detail that brings it into the modern era			0
" @entity229 takes pride in his fashion - forward embellishments , such as high - waisted riding pants with reverse pleats , a side zipper or leather inseam patches , and a double - breasted morning coat lined to be warm enough on its own			1
the self - taught tailor says he has a character or archetype in mind for each piece -- the hunter , the gentleman -- but he acknowledges that he 's designing for himself			0
that 's how he learned to sew , by altering clothes to his liking , in a fitted , tailored style inspired by his uncles , businessmen in @entity208 , even if his first creation was a pair of pants made from a bedsheet			0
" my view was , ' everything you wear has to fit well , ' " @entity196 said			0
" but when i went to @entity255 's , things were not made to fit as i wanted , so i 'd buy clothes and made them to fit like i wanted them to fit			0
" in the month before the competition , he stayed awake for days at a time to finish the collection			0
in the home he shares with his girlfriend , an aspiring opera singer , he pieced together 12 fall menswear runway looks -- eight for the semifinal and four more in case he advanced to saturday night 's final			2
@entity196 said he does n't want to start his own label or become a " @entity129 " - style celeb just yet			0
for now , his goal is to find an apprenticeship with an established menswear designer or contract sewer			2
" i just want to give it a try and see what happens , " he said in an interview last week in a home studio littered with spools of thread and bags of fabric			0
" even if i do n't win , i feel like just being there will help me find what i need to advance to the next level			0
" in @entity11 , he knew he 'd have the eyes of an appreciative local community , as well as some established designers from the upper echelons of high fashion			1
@entity290 already has a foothold in the industry			0
celebrities such as @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 wear his gowns on the red carpet			0
he has a flagship store in @entity2 and an eponymous line sold in @entity301 and boutiques around the world			1
still , he had a full schedule this week in @entity11			0
" we look at it as a business opportunity to find new customers and form new relationships with retailers , " said @entity290 , the youngest designer to win " @entity129 " or land on @entity307 's 40 under 40 list			0
" who wants to alienate a customer who 's ready to shop ? " @entity290 already showed his ballet - inspired @entity317 collection in @entity2 and @entity5 , but he brought it to @entity11 for a show saturday			1
on friday he participated in a trunk show hosted by a family - owned department store , @entity320 's of @entity321 , where he would like to see his clothes sold , he said			0
he also judged the emerging designer competition , along with @entity34 and other industry insiders and entertainers : singer - songwriter @entity328 , designers @entity329 and @entity331 and @entity332 , winner of the 2012 @entity11 emerging designer competition			1
@entity334 judged the emerging designer competition in 2009 , when swimwear designer @entity335 won			0
since then , @entity335 ' swimwear has been featured in publications including @entity67 and @entity338 , and her collections have been picked up by @entity340 , @entity341 and other high - end boutiques around the world			0
" @entity11 has a sophisticated , fashion - savvy audience , so it 's just a matter of making my products more accessible to them , " said @entity334 , who was in the city this week to visit her @entity161 store and promote her latest collection for @entity348 department stores			2
" it 's also a great way for me to learn more about what 's happening in fashion in that part of the country			2
" the emerging designer competition final drew hundreds of people saturday			0
the competition was tight , but ultimately the panel chose @entity229 as the winner , with @entity34 describing his collection as " something special			1
" he also won the audience favorite award , another $ 250 prize			0
dozens of fans swarmed around him , making it hard for his sisters and girlfriend to reach him			0
as far as he was concerned , the win vindicated his efforts			0
" it 's shown me i am meant for this , " he said of his win			0
" this is my way in life			0
any impact i 'll be able to make on the human race will be in this field			0
