there were no genetic tests 400,000 years ago , so our ancient relatives did n't know as much about themselves as we know about them now			2
scientists have reconstructed a nearly complete mitochondrial genome of an ancient human relative , whose remains were found in @entity8 ( " pit of bones " ) in northern @entity9			1
it is the oldest dna to be recovered from an early humanlike species , authors of a study wrote in the journal @entity17			1
the ancient species that has revealed some of its genetic secrets , via bone fragments from a femur , is probably not directly linked to your family tree though			1
" it 's quite clear that this is not a direct ancestor of people today , " said @entity26 , a biologist at the @entity27 and senior author of the study			2
instead , he said , this representative of an early humanlike species , called @entity35 , could be an ancestor of both @entity36 and another group called the @entity38			0
the genetic relationship to @entity40 , discovered through this dna research , is surprising because the @entity35 remains found in the cave have many @entity36 - like features			1
the only remnants of @entity40 come from @entity45 -- a long way from @entity9			1
" it 's sort of an open question really what this means , and i think further research into the nuclear genome of these hominins will address that , " @entity26 said			0
how they did it @entity26 and colleagues used a new method for sequencing ancient , degraded genetic material to put together the 400,000 - year - old specimen 's mitochondrial genome			1
it is the oldest dna ever found outside permafrost conditions -- in other words , it was not permanently frozen			1
" the retrieval of such ancient human dna is a major technical achievement , and promises further recovery of such material from other fossils in this time range , both in the @entity8 and elsewhere , where we would not previously have expected it , or looked for it , " said @entity66 , researcher at the @entity67 in @entity68 , who was not involved in the study			1
mitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms			0
dna stored in the mitochondria is passed to children through the maternal line only ( i.e. , only moms can pass it on ) , so it 's only a small snapshot of inherited genes			1
genetic material in the cell 's nucleus comes from both parents and gives a fuller picture of genetic heritage			0
to study genetics of our ancient predecessors , researchers have an easier time studying mitochondrial dna because there are hundreds of times more copies of it in each cell			1
" it 's a much bigger chance to find some fragments of this preserved , " @entity26 said			0
the method that researchers used involves separating the two strands of the dna double helix			1
they then make a " library " from each of the two strands			0
if part of one strand is damaged , its analogue on the other strand -- which is made of complementary genetic partners -- may be intact			0
" that is sort of the big trick involved , " @entity26 said			0
after sequencing the mitochondrial dna , researchers then compared the result with genetic information about @entity36 and @entity40			1
since nuclear dna encompasses more information about a person 's inheritance , a nuclear genome sequence from @entity35 may reveal even more clearly how it is connected to other ancient humanlike species , he said			2
but retrieving the nuclear dna sequence will be challenging , study authors wrote			2
just to get the mitochondrial dna sequence , it took about two grams of bone -- less than 0.1 ounce -- even though hundreds of copies of this dna are in every cell			1
still , @entity26 said , the sequencing technique his group used " opens a possibility to now do this at many other sites , and really begin to understand earlier human evolution			2
" relationship to other species researchers thought initially the mitochondrial dna of the homo heidelbergensis specimen would share a common ancestor with @entity36			1
neanderthals lived in @entity159 beginning as much as 300,000 years ago , @entity26 said			0
( homo sapiens , our species , first appeared in @entity163 between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago			2
) instead , researchers discovered through the dna that this specimen is closer to the @entity40 , a group related to the @entity36			2
a likely explanation is that in @entity169 this species gave rise to @entity40 , and in @entity171 they were the ancestors of @entity36 , @entity26 said			0
but more research needs to be done to verify that theory			0
humans , @entity36 related to yet another group @entity176 is known about the @entity40			0
although some of their remains were found in southern @entity45 , their genetic signature is only found today on islands in the @entity182			1
@entity26 was also the senior author on a 2012 study in the journal @entity185 analyzing the @entity40 genome			0
that research suggested that human ancestors and the @entity40 ' ancestors must have branched off from one another as much as 700,000 years ago -- although that number is vague			0
still , it seems that the @entity40 must have mated with indigenous people in @entity193 and @entity194 , @entity26 said			0
about 3 % to 5 % of the dna of people from @entity196 ( islands in the southwest @entity182 ) , @entity194 and @entity193 as well as aboriginal people from the @entity200 comes from the @entity40			2
on the other hand , everyone who lives outside @entity163 today probably has some @entity36 dna in them , @entity26 said in 2012			2
the bottom line , @entity26 said , is that the relationships between these early human relatives -- homo heidelbergensis , @entity36 and @entity40 -- are not clear - cut			1
" it 's going to be a more complex history that one will eventually clarify with the help of @entity142 , " he said			0
@entity211 is on @entity212 at @ lizlandau .			0
