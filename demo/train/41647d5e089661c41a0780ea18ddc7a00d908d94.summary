@entity0 -- the spread of the flu across the @entity6 appears to have slowed in some areas , but officials wo n't know for weeks whether the cases have peaked , the @entity3 director said friday			1
twenty - four states and @entity11 were reporting high levels of flu activity , according to the @entity3 's flu advisory report for december 30 through january 5			1
that 's down from 29 states the previous week , said dr. @entity17 , director of the @entity3			1
however , " the only area of the country that 's still relatively unaffected ... is the far @entity20 , " although plenty of cases have been reported there , dr. @entity23 , chief of the @entity24 of the @entity3 's @entity25 , said friday			1
the number of pediatric deaths associated with influenza rose by two , according to the @entity3			1
there have been 20 deaths of people under the age of 18 since the flu outbreak began			1
while the @entity3 does not count the number of adult deaths related to the flu , some states do , and that data suggests dozens have died			1
according to the latest @entity3 activity map , flu levels dropped in several states , particularly in the @entity43 , including @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
in the @entity51 , levels in some states have also improved , such as @entity11 , but @entity11 remains among the areas of high activity			1
the number of states reporting widespread activity , however , increased to 47 from 41 , according to the @entity3 's flu advisory report			1
the only states without widespread activity are @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
" widespread " means that more than 50 % of geographic regions in a state -- counties , for example -- are reporting flu activity			1
it addresses the spread of the flu , not its severity			2
" bottom line : it 's flu season , " @entity17 told reporters			1
flu activity is " elevated " in most of the @entity6 , he said , and " it may be decreasing in some areas , but that 's hard to predict ... influenza activity ebbs and flows			1
" officials will know in the next couple of weeks whether the season has peaked , he said			1
" the only thing predictable about the flu is , it 's unpredictable			2
" " ... we are into what would classically be described as a flu epidemic , " dr. @entity86 , director of the @entity87 at the @entity88 , told @entity1 's @entity89 on thursday			2
" it 's still on the uptick , " he said			0
" remember , once it peaks , you still have a considerable amount of time where there is a lot of flu activity , and right now it may have peaked in some places , but for the most part , it has not yet peaked , " @entity86 said			1
many reports of emergency rooms and clinics being overwhelmed with patients could be linked to other illnesses , too			2
this is also a prominent season for many other respiratory viruses , @entity23 said			1
@entity112 , which causes diarrhea and vomiting , has also been circulating			2
vaccination although the flu vaccine is far from perfect , it 's the best prevention tool we have , @entity17 said			2
you can still get it -- it 's better late than never			0
the flu vaccine is about 62 % effective , @entity17 said			2
" the 62 % -- we 'd love it to be better , but it is actually a substantial public health benefit for the population , " @entity23 said			0
based on vaccine coverage surveys , 37 % of @entity6 had been vaccinated by mid-november , @entity3 officials said			2
that 's about on track with what was seen at this time last year			0
" we have seen a lot of vaccination happening in the last couple of weeks , " @entity23 said			0
" i do n't know where we 'll end up this year			2
" vaccine manufacturers told @entity1 on thursday that there is plenty of vaccine for those who want to get a flu shot			2
however , there are reports of spot shortages of the vaccine , @entity17 said , so call your provider ahead of time if you still want to get the vaccine			0
" you may have to check in several places to find the vaccine , because most of the more than 130 million doses that were produced by vaccine manufacturers this year have already been given , " he said			0
early flu season the flu came early this season , and cases are more severe than last year , health officials say			1
