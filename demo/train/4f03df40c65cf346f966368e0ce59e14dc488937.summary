@entity0 -- the @entity2 has again indefinitely blocked plans to disseminate video of an important federal court case involving same - sex marriage in @entity7			1
the justices in an unsigned order wednesday prevented any distribution of the live video stream outside the @entity13 , @entity7 , courthouse where the case is being heard , and any real - time or delayed posting on the @entity15			0
in a trial that began monday , a federal judge in @entity13 will decide whether the state 's @entity19 banning same - sex marriage is constitutional			0
@entity7 voters approved the measure in november 2008 , prompting an appeal by several homosexual couples			0
as part of a pilot program , the judge had agreed to allow video of the trial to be sent live to other rooms within the courthouse and to five other federal courthouses , and to be posted several hours later on the popular video site @entity34			2
opponents of same - sex marriage had asked the @entity2 to intervene , saying witness testimony could be affected if cameras were present			1
it is extremely rare for a federal trial to be televised to the broader public			0
the @entity2 's latest order allows distribution only to designated " overflow " rooms in the @entity13 courthouse , where people who want to view the trial but are unable to fit into the courtroom can watch the proceedings on closed - circuit television			1
a majority of @entity2 justices concluded expanded broadcast should not permitted because , they wrote , " it appears the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting			2
" there has been much internal debate in federal courts around the country about the televised experiment , with several judges and administrators privately expressing concern that it could eventually lead to the entire judiciary being televised , including the @entity2			2
in dissent to the ruling , justice @entity69 and three liberal colleagues complained the public would be deprived of watching " a nonjury civil case of great public interest to five other federal courthouses located in @entity77 [ @entity0 ] , @entity78 [ @entity7 ] , @entity79 [ @entity80 ] , @entity13 [ @entity7 ] , and @entity81 [ @entity82 ]			1
" he was supported by justices @entity83 , @entity85 and @entity86			0

" the case is @entity99 ( @entity100 ) .			0
