-- securing the release of @entity3 prisoners @entity4 and @entity5 from @entity6 was not cost - free			1
it may also be an omen of the return of recurring efforts by @entity3 administrations of both parties to negotiate deals with @entity13 that inevitably fail			1
the @entity3 supposedly does not have diplomatic relations with @entity6			1
after all , the arms proliferating , dollar counterfeiting , nuclear - armed dictatorship , which torpedoed a @entity19 ship in 2010 , has n't accounted for all of the foreign nationals it kidnapped abroad to train its spies , and occasionally threatens @entity3 and its allies with annihilation			2
but that has n't stopped a string of senior @entity3 diplomats from visiting @entity13 over the past three administrations			2
the most recent denizen was @entity3 director of national intelligence @entity30 , who on saturday brought home the two @entity3 imprisoned by the regime for alleged speech and faith - related activities that would n't get a second look in the civilized world			1
while @entity30 's trip may have been " last - minute , " as the @entity49 administration described it , the efforts to arrange it probably went on for months -- and are emblematic of an unfortunate approach to @entity6 and its @entity44 allies that spans @entity46 and @entity47 administrations -- especially in their final years			2
@entity52 and @entity13 both have agendas beyond what is visible today			0
is @entity6 being magnanimous in releasing @entity4 and @entity5 before their trumped - up prison sentences ran out , or might it want something in return ? in fact , it has already acquired something : the appearance of legitimacy			1
the autocrats who maintain @entity6 's totalitarian rule through fear -- and the young leader , @entity67 , who even had his uncle executed -- relish any opportunity to show how they can make representatives of vastly more powerful nations come to @entity13 and kiss their proverbial ring			1
previous visitors in this vein have included then - secretary of state @entity75 , former president @entity77 , former vice president @entity78 , and various representatives of then - secretary of state @entity80			0
the @entity6 government knows more about the @entity3 political cycle than many @entity3 political scientists			1
it saw that the final two years of the @entity86 and @entity87 administrations were fruitful for dealing with presidents and secretaries of state desperately trying to burnish their legacies			0
under president @entity86 , aid to @entity6 from @entity52 and @entity93 spiked beginning in 1999 , and included efforts to build nuclear power plants for the @entity6			2
under president @entity87 , @entity96 announced in 2007 a breakthrough whereby @entity13 would give up its nuclear program in exchange for aid			0
as some predicted , @entity6 took the aid but kept the nuclear program			2
it now likely hopes for a repeat of sorts			0
@entity6 no longer depends on foreign handouts for its survival			2
by some accounts , its economy is better off than ever , thanks to expanded trade with @entity44 -- much of which is supposedly banned by @entity112 resolutions			0
but @entity13 would still welcome further sanctions relief and loves to be courted diplomatically , which makes it look strong			0
courtship of @entity6 also invariably involves obeisance to the notion that @entity44 will pressure its neighbor into behaving -- and perhaps even surrendering its nuclear weapons program			2
this is a diplomatic truism that just is n't true : @entity122 has always normalized trade with @entity6 rapidly after any disruptions in the wake of @entity6 nuclear tests or other belligerent acts			0
but it seems only @entity13 and @entity122 are in on this joke played on @entity3 and allied diplomats -- and @entity44 's unelected government itself cherishes the legitimacy it gets from being seen as the regional diplomatic linchpin			0
that is why @entity122 has also been promoting multilateral talks with @entity6			0
the way out of this is to stop believing that romancing @entity13 will advance @entity3 interests			1
@entity6 has violated numerous arms agreements with the @entity3 or other parties			1
@entity13 will not be sweet - talked out of its nuclear arsenal or other provocations			0
@entity52 can end the cycle of @entity6 taking @entity3 hostage by declaring @entity3 passports invalid for travel to @entity6			1
furthermore , the @entity3 and its allies should pivot to a program of putting nonviolent pressure on the @entity6 regime			1
@entity52 should tell the truth about @entity44 's support of @entity13 , increase aid to defectors who try to pierce the curtain of censorship that keeps @entity6 in the dark and punish any company or bank that does business with the regime			1
putting the @entity3 at the same table as lawless thugs is n't just morally repugnant -- it 's ineffective			0
the free world should devote more effort to a better form of diplomacy that makes life difficult for its opponents .			0
