@entity0 returns to @entity1 facing the biggest international crisis in years			1
it is critical the @entity4 and @entity5 work together to send a strong and unified message that @entity8 's invasion of @entity9 is unacceptable , and take quick action to punish president @entity11			1
while we are both relatively new to @entity1 , we 've been here long enough to realize that our divided @entity0 is n't good at " quick action " or " unified messages			1
" yet we also recognize that the roots of @entity8 's actions last week to invade and control @entity17 are complex , and they predate president @entity19 's tenure			2
this challenge is truly bigger than our partisan divides			1
@entity11 clearly decided that the benefits of an armed intervention in @entity9 outweighed whatever costs the @entity25 would be willing to impose			1
the @entity25 must reset that calculation			2
in that spirit , we welcome @entity19 's call for bipartisan action in the @entity0 , which will hopefully move to quickly pass a serious package of financial support for @entity9 and to bolster the authorities that the administration already has to pursue and penalize @entity8 individuals and entities			1
live blog : ' strong belief ' @entity8 incursion is illegal the @entity25 must make clear to @entity11 that by violating @entity9 's sovereignty and violating multiple international commitments , he has made a strategic miscalculation that will lead to severe impacts for @entity8 's economy and its standing in the world			1
beyond immediate financial actions against the @entity8 regime and even @entity11 himself , if @entity8 attempts to expand its military operations and threatens eastern @entity9 , we and our allies in @entity47 need to be ready to implement a trade embargo , explore restrictions on imports of @entity8 natural gas , and cut off @entity8 banks from the international financial system			1
we also need to open up exports of domestic natural gas to our allies and partners in the region so that they are less susceptible to @entity8 's efforts to use energy as a weapon			1
if , in the coming days , @entity8 does not back down , @entity9 will require more than just our moral and financial support , including defense assistance in the form of a military assessment team to examine @entity9 's needs , as well as enhanced intelligence cooperation			1
@entity11 : military force last resort our allies and partners in @entity77 and @entity47 are undoubtedly watching this situation with much apprehension about what it says about the credibility of @entity25 leadership and the future of the transatlantic alliance			2
to this end , we need to support our emerging partners in the region			0
for years , @entity88 has been requesting a defensive arms package that would include anti-aircraft and anti-tank capabilities that the 2008 conflict showed were sorely needed			0
we need to provide this support and finalize a @entity94 ( @entity94 ) for @entity88 to join @entity95			0
for those partners already in the pipeline for membership , we should move up accession as soon as possible , even as early as the @entity100 in @entity101 in september			0
recent events should break the freeze on @entity95 expansion that has been in place for the past five years			0
it is precisely the ambiguity in which @entity95 left @entity88 after the 2008 @entity108 that fueled @entity8 's belief that it can bully @entity95 partners and not face a credible response			2
opinion : why it will be hard for @entity114 to stop @entity11 we also need to show solidarity with our allies who are already in @entity95			0
we should make clear that we share @entity119 's concerns about the status of @entity17 @entity119 and other ethnic minorities			0
and we should reject @entity8 's claims that it is protecting ethnic @entity8			2
how should our friends in @entity124 , @entity125 , or @entity126 take @entity8 rhetoric about the need to " protect " ethnic @entity8 in @entity9 when they , too , have significant populations of ethnic @entity8 living in their countries ? @entity95 should review its force posture in the region and take tangible steps to show the credibility of our @entity136 guarantee to the most vulnerable members of the alliance			1
this should include strengthening the @entity95 and @entity25 military presence in frontline member states			2
we also need to admit to ourselves that the significant military cuts proposed by defense secretary @entity143 a week ago are entirely unrealistic in today 's threat environment , and that as we focus more on @entity145 , we can not ignore ongoing threats to @entity148 security			0
none of this will be easy			0
it will require leadership , not crisis management focused on de-escalation , which seems to be the primary concern of the @entity155			0
some of our @entity148 allies have responded strongly , and others will need prodding from the administration and even the president himself			0
some may argue that these actions are overly provocative and will only encourage @entity8 to be more aggressive			1
but provoking @entity8 is exactly what five years of " reset " has now achieved			0
if we do not take these steps , similar actions by @entity8 and other authoritarian regimes around the world will only proliferate			1
so , too , will the uncertainty and hedging of our global allies and potential partners , who already , from @entity173 to the @entity174 to @entity145 , have plenty of reasons to doubt our seriousness and question whether @entity173 will continue to be the leading force for peace and stability in the world in the decades to come			0
the stakes are extremely high , but this is an opportunity to correct some of the mistakes we have made recently in our relationship with @entity8 and to send a message heard around the world that @entity173 is not going anywhere			2
join us on @entity191 / @entity190 .			0

@entity193 and @entity194 feel the @entity25 response on @entity9 should transcend " partisan divides "
they say @entity0 should support *sanctions* , implement a trade embargo
consider restricting imports of natural gas and cutting off @entity8 banks , they say
they argue that similar actions will proliferate around the world if steps are n't taken now
