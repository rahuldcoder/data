-- they call it " @entity3			1
" on it : the names , ages and addresses of 21 people accused by police of buying sex from a 29 - year - old fitness instructor			1
and it 's the talk of @entity13 , the historic , picture - perfect @entity14 town that had been -- until recently , at least -- best known for its bygone shipbuilding industry and a money - making tourist trade			1
police say the instructor , @entity17 , used her @entity19 fitness studio and the office of her business partner , @entity22 , to run a prostitution ring			1
they say she videotaped intimate encounters with some of the dozens of customers she allegedly entertained			0
on monday , police released a partial list of those accused of hiring @entity29 after a judge rejected a request to shield their names from public view			1
the attorney for two men named on the list argued that identifying them would destroy their lives , families and careers			2
police are releasing the names and addresses in batches , and more names are expected soon			1
strong 's lawyer , @entity45 , says the list of @entity29 's alleged johns runs 150 names long			1
among them , according to @entity45 : lawyers , accountants and a local tv personality			2
while much of the world is getting its first salacious tastes of the whole affair , @entity13 residents have been dealing with it since at least july , when police arrested @entity22 and made the case public for the first time			1
the tawdry details have riveted residents of the small community of 10,000 , a tree - shaded , picket - fenced tourist destination of stately sea captain 's homes and 200 - year - old inns just a short drive from the @entity72 oceanside compound in nearby @entity73			0
everyone wants to know who 's on that list			2
" you ca n't go anywhere without people bringing it up , " said @entity77 , managing editor of the 6,000 - circulation @entity78			1
and it 's starting to wear on at least some of residents			0
" i 'm tired of it , honestly , " resident @entity85 told @entity0 affiliate @entity86			0
" i 'm really tired of it			0
there 's got to be more to @entity13 than this			1
this is not a good legacy			0
" it 's certainly not typical for a place where the most recent crime roundup issued by police leads off with charges against a 51 - year - old man for letting his dog roam free			2
" boy , it really hit us hard , " resident @entity100 told @entity86			0
the sex allegedly occurred at a store - front @entity19 exercise studio , run by @entity29			1
@entity19 is , according to the brand 's official website , " an exhilarating , effective , easy - to - follow , @entity109 - inspired , calorie - burning dance fitness - party that 's moving millions of people toward joy and health			2
" according to @entity13 police , someone tipped off authorities more than a year ago that something more than @entity109 - inspired dance was going on at the studio , located on a leafy stretch of @entity120 , next door to one pizza parlor and across the street from another			1
@entity14 's @entity125 and the state 's @entity126 soon started looking into the case			1
and in february , five months after the investigation began , police raided @entity29 's fitness studio and @entity22 's office			1
what police found has n't been officially released -- the search warrant records have been sealed			1
but the @entity135 newspaper of @entity136 reported that the findings included videotapes of @entity29 having sex with numerous men , a ledger containing prices for various sex acts and detailed customer records			2
a grand jury indicted @entity29 on 106 counts related to the alleged prostitution business , including invasion of privacy charges for allegedly filming some of her sessions , according to court documents			1
the grand jury indicted @entity22 , who is also a private investigator , on 59 counts			0
both have pleaded not guilty			0
neither @entity29 -- whose studio is now closed , according to its website -- nor her attorney , @entity157 , returned calls from @entity0			2
the @entity161 district attorney 's office declined to comment tuesday			0
police are also issuing summonses for the men on @entity29 's list , accusing them of engaging in prostitution , a misdemeanor charge			1
two men on the list argued the names should n't be made public because doing so would cause " irreparable harm " to their reputations , their families and their businesses , according to court documents			1
they deserved to be shielded under state victims ' rights laws and the state constitution , their attorney argued			0
on monday , @entity181 justice @entity180 disagreed , ruling that the names of people accused of crimes have to be available to the public			2
" the principle that court proceedings are public is essential to public confidence			1
if persons charged with crimes could withhold their identities , the public would not be able to monitor proceedings to observe whether justice has been done and to observe whether certain defendants may have received favored treatment , " @entity180 wrote in his decision			1
@entity180 ruled that some of them men , those who had been filmed during sex acts , could also be victims of a crime -- invasion of privacy -- and deserved to have their addresses shielded from the public , but tuesday he revised his decision after a " conference call with counsel for the interested parties in the civil action , " according to a @entity13 police news release			1
one man told @entity0 affiliate @entity212 that his name appears on the original list			2
but he said it 's not him			0
" when i first saw my name on the computer i laughed , " said the man , who @entity0 has chosen not to name			0
" and then as i got up i 'm thinking , ' all my years in law enforcement , all my years , activities with children , coaching baseball , the young men that i know who are now dads today and responsible citizens , this is very misleading and i do n't think it 's fair			0
' and then i became upset , to say the least i was very upset			0
" the release also has upset some of @entity77 's readers			0
the @entity78 editor says she 's getting letters wondering why the names of the men are coming out before trial			0
she said she is n't getting any letters from readers upset that @entity29 's name has been plastered in media accounts of the case , bringing up what some say is a long - held double standard in prostitution cases -- the accused prostitute gets all the attention , while her customers slip away out of public view			2
as it happens , that tide appears to be turning , said @entity250 , a @entity251 , @entity252 , criminal justice researcher with @entity253 who has been tracking anti-prostitution programs since 2005			0
nationwide , @entity250 said , 525 cities and counties have at least once tried some form of what 's known as " shaming " -- publicizing the names of men who buy sex or focusing on them instead of the sellers			0
no one has formally studied the effectiveness of such efforts , he said			0
" but evidence that is available points in the direction of it being a pretty effective thing to do , " he said			0
" but it 's not definitive			0
" @entity274 's national prostitution study for the @entity275 ( @entity276 ) and while @entity13 does n't appear to be intentionally shaming @entity29 's alleged customers -- the city releases a weekly list of people accused of crimes -- all the attention is putting a spotlight on the men , nevertheless			1
" had the city hired a public relations firm , they could n't have written a better script for generating as much attention as possible , " @entity250 said , referring to the incremental release of the names of those charged as prostitution customers			2
@entity0 's @entity294 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0
