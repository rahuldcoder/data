@entity0 -- @entity3 's largest utility said thursday that more radiation than previously thought was released into the atmosphere in march 2011 , in the days after the nuclear disaster that followed an earthquake and tsunami			1
@entity9 ( @entity9 ) estimates about 900,000 terabecquerels of radioactive materials were released between march 12 and march 31 , according to @entity3 's @entity13 news agency			1
this is more than the estimates issued by the @entity17 of @entity3 or the government 's nuclear safety agency , the news agency said			1
the utility said the release of radioactive material after march dropped sharply			2
hard lessons for @entity25 nuclear safety from @entity27 meltdown the latest figures from @entity9 come a day after the @entity29 released a report on radiation doses that said infants living in the communities worst affected by the meltdown at the @entity36 plant were exposed to much higher than normal levels of radiation			1
in one town in the @entity27 area , the estimated thyroid doses to infants are within a dose band of 100 to 200 millisieverts ( msv ) , the preliminary report said			2
this level of radiation exposure could be associated with an increased likelihood of developing cancer			0
however , in the rest of @entity3 , the estimated thyroid doses are within a dose band of 1 to 10 @entity52 , the report said			2
outside the country , the estimated thyroid doses are less than @entity52 , and are usually far below this very low level , it said			0
scientists looked at radiation doses to the thyroid , among other measures , because radioactive iodine - 131 tends to accumulate in the thyroid , the most exposed organ in the body			1
after the @entity68 accident in 1986 , a higher incidence of thyroid cancer was found in people who were children at the time of the accident , previous studies have found			0
in @entity3 , people were chiefly exposed externally through radioactive material in the air and deposited on the ground , and internally through inhalation of radioactive particles and their ingestion in foodstuffs and water , the @entity29 said			1
wednesday 's report is the first international effort to assess global radiation doses resulting from the nuclear disaster , the @entity29 said			1
its estimates will help the @entity29 draw up a report into the likely health risks resulting from the radiation exposure			1
@entity3 has set a goal for cleaning up all areas where radiation levels are 1 millisievert over normal background , based on an estimate of eight hours a day spent outdoors			2
cleanup efforts in the first year focused on areas where annual doses of radiation were between 20 and 50 msv a year -- 7 to 16 times the typical amount a resident of an industrialized country receives in a year , but below the threshold for an increased risk of cancer			0
@entity9 was effectively nationalized earlier this month after the government approved a request for a 1 trillion yen ( $ 12.5 billion ) injection of capital			0
the company , which was left reeling by the disaster last year , needs government help to stay solvent as it faces enormous compensation costs			0
the tsunami that followed the magnitude - 9 quake on march 11 last year swamped the @entity36 plant , knocking out power to cooling systems and leading to meltdowns in its three operating reactors			0
the resulting release of radioactivity forced residents of several towns near the plant to flee their homes , and a 20 - kilometer ( 12.5 - mile ) zone around the plant remains closed to the public			0
@entity1 's @entity128 contributed to this report .			0

more radioactive material than thought was released in days after disaster , @entity9 says
@entity9 estimates about 900,000 terabecquerels of radioactive materials were released
a @entity29 report on people 's exposure to radiation following the disaster gives a mixed picture
some infants were exposed to high radiation doses but levels were low in most of @entity3
