-- the @entity1 had secret orders this week to be " prepared to act " to stop a cargo ship carrying @entity5 arms destined for @entity6 , @entity0 has learned			1
@entity1 vessels in the @entity8 received orders to move " into the proximity of the ship and act if ordered , " according to a senior @entity12 military official familiar with the operation			1
the scenario included the possibility of boarding the ship , which was eventually stopped in the @entity16 by @entity18 naval forces , who authorities said seized a cargo of @entity5 rockets and missiles			1

the weapons were then shipped into @entity31 and loaded at a port in southern @entity31			2
@entity12 and @entity18 intelligence grew concerned when the cargo ship in the @entity35 suddenly diverted from its expected heading to @entity36 and suddenly turned north toward @entity31 to load up			1
the @entity12 does not believe the @entity31 government sanctioned the smuggling			2
@entity12 navy ships in the region secretly tracked the cargo down the @entity35 to the @entity42 and then to the @entity16 until the @entity18 navy boarded the vessel before it reached @entity36 , a typical point for unloading smuggled weapons			1
