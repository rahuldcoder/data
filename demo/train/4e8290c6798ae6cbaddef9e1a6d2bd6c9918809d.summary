-- a young woman claims she was in a car with her fiancé when three police officers came by			1
she says two of them raped her while the third kept guard and later attempted to extort money from her fiancé			0
all parties involved were arrested -- the woman , her fiancé , and the three police officers			1
the 27 - year - old woman was charged with public indecency			1
what has shocked the public about the incident is not only the preposterousness of the young lady 's arrest , but the subsequent accusation by the judges that has effectively transformed a victim into an offender			1
news : police say woman , husband were in " immoral position " international human rights organizations have historically held that rape by security forces amounts to torture			1
in @entity34 , rape is a serious crime that is severely punished			2
this single incident brings to the forefront how such transgressions are allowed to take place , and reveals serious flaws in the @entity34 criminal justice system and in @entity34 law as a whole			1
the incident also highlights the current government 's lack of competence in addressing the issues that affect @entity34 most directly			1
a @entity49 spokesman told @entity0 : " these kind of crimes and violations committed by the police rarely happen and do not represent the security system			2
the judicial system did its role and the three accused policemen are arrested			0
" throughout @entity60 's era , police officers have had free reign in the country			1
they pillaged , raped , and repressed citizens all over the nation			0
they were , after all , the former dictator 's trusted safe keepers			0
today 's police force constitutes the very same apparatus that kept the former president in power			2
the @entity71 has not made a significant effort ( if any at all ) to reform the ministry -- which would include retraining the police , doing away with repressive security measures and , most importantly , removing the figures that have long represented oppression from the ministry 's leadership roles			1
in fact , as of today , all that has been accomplished is the formation of a " task force " that aims to discuss possibilities of reform			0
the task force only held its first meeting on september 27 -- months after the current minister of the interior took office			0
on the legislative front , there have been no changes in citizen protection laws since the @entity95 was voted in			0
one of the assembly 's latest encounters with women 's rights dealt with a clause drafted by the constitutional committee on @entity101			2
the clause relegated women to a " complementary " status with men , and would have been included in the final constitution had it not been struck down by the central coordination committee			0
it is important to remember that women 's rights in @entity34 today do not depend on the actions of a few , and that while progress is slow , not all is lost			1
women in @entity34 have long enjoyed a @entity113 that is advanced when compared to neighboring countries			2
there is a serious risk , however , that any progress brought forth by the code could be reversed			0
whereas civil society has been vigilant in defending this young woman 's rights and raising awareness about violence against women , the government has yet to act in a constructive manner			1
many official figures , particularly those hailing from the ruling @entity129 party @entity128 , have been defending the judiciary 's decisions			2
for example , @entity132 , the head of @entity128 's political bureau and a member of the @entity95 , insists that the protests taking place in support of the victim are attempts by the opposition to bring down the government			0
the @entity142 denies that the victim was even accused			0
the @entity71 retains that the couple was found in an " immoral position " when the police first stopped the car			2
the courts and @entity34 government had a historic opportunity to define @entity34 society and rebuke state impunity			0
but instead of standing up against the heinous crime of rape and affirming the need to respect human dignity , the @entity34 judiciary and @entity71 have put human rights to shame			1
following tuesday 's hearing , the victim 's lawyers have expressed optimism that the charges brought forth against her would be dropped			0
the incident , however , calls for a serious review of @entity34 law -- including those codifying public morality or criminalizing indecency			1
* @entity0 put @entity172 's points to the @entity34 government			1
in relation to the public indecency charge against the 27 - year - old woman , a @entity174 spokesman said : " @entity179 ( @entity178 ) said that the @entity34 authorities must drop the indecency charges but how can the government interfere in the judicial system ? in all democracies , the judicial system is independent and makes its own decisions			1
it is up to the judge to decide whether she is guilty or not			0
in my personal opinion , i hope the charges will be dropped however , i should not let my opinion influence the decision of the judge			0
" the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity172 .			0
