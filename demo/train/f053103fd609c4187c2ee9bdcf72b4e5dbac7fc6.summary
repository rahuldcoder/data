-- the @entity1 our @entity2 , or @entity4 , is a win for entrepreneurship as well as bipartisan politics , and given economic hardship , unemployment and political bickering , it 's time for a win			1
next step : declare victory and unleash an economic winning streak			2
on thursday , president @entity16 signed the @entity4 with overwhelming bipartisan support			1
the bill makes it easier for startups to raise money , to stay private when they need to and to go public when the time is right			1
overall , it promotes a pro-entrepreneurship agenda			0
what impact will the @entity4 have ? the bill 's " crowdfunding " provision is getting the most attention			1
it allows entrepreneurs to raise small amounts of capital from large pools of individual investors			1
the @entity35 provides a tool for private citizens to form new marketplaces as social networks evolve to become more than just networks of friends			0
web - based platforms such as @entity43 and @entity44 allow entrepreneurs to raise up to $ 1 million annually , as sanctioned by the new legislation			1
this provides a funding source for startups that might otherwise have never made it past the business plan stage			1
many entrepreneurs finance their fledgling businesses with their own lines of credit , sometimes backed by the value of their homes			2
with the recent recession , lines of credit have been difficult to obtain , and the value of many homes has decreased			0
@entity63 opens a new source of capital , especially for underserved communities			1
@entity63 could invigorate local economies outside of @entity68 and other entrepreneurial centers			1
further , the @entity4 allows companies to stay private longer , which gives entrepreneurs the flexibility to decide how and when it 's best to go public			1
previously , companies with more than 500 investors were mandated to file with the @entity76			0
the @entity4 raises this number to 2,000 investors and excludes employees as shareholders in that number			1
this enables private companies to build revenue and develop sophistication before entering the capital markets			0
when the time is right , the @entity4 makes it easier for a new class of " emerging growth companies " to go public			1
for businesses with less than $ 1 billion in revenue , the number of audited financial statements required is reduced			0
young , high - growth firms are allowed up to five years to comply with certain @entity97 disclosures			1
@entity97 compliance is much more onerous for smaller companies than it is for larger entities such as @entity101 , @entity102 or @entity103			0
the @entity4 helps smaller companies conserve resources			1
it also provides an " @entity105 " during which time emerging growth companies can protect sensitive information and competitive trade secrets			2
of course , there is concern about the potential for financial fraud			0
will there be scams ? there always are			0
will @entity116 lose his shirt chasing the latest crowdfunded investment idea ? to protect investors , the @entity4 includes an amendment that mandates companies to provide basic financial information to investors before seeking crowdfunding			1
it also requires third - party intermediaries , in the form of websites managing crowdfunding shares , to register with the sec. the amendment also sets limits on the amount of money an individual can invest to prevent investors from taking too much risk			1
individuals with an annual income or net worth of less than $ 100,000 , for example , would be limited to investing 5 % of their income in crowdfunding			0
in addition , @entity16 called on the @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 to monitor the new legislation closely and report regularly on their findings			0
certainly , the @entity4 is a win for entrepreneurs in @entity151			1
but it is only a first step			0
the bill will help innovators reduce burdensome regulation and gain faster access to capital to grow their startup businesses			0
but we need to do more			0
we need to overhaul immigration to welcome foreign - born founders			1
according to a december study by the @entity165 , immigrants founded or co-founded almost half of the 50 top venture - backed companies in the @entity151 , and on average these companies created 150 jobs			2
we must enhance commercialization of research out of @entity151 universities			0
one way to do this is to adopt a standardized licensing agreement for spinoffs			0
another way is to make open - technology licensing a condition for universities to receive federal research dollars			2
currently , the @entity182 of 1980 requires faculty innovators to work through their own university technology licensing offices			0
to catalyze our innovation economy , we need to increase collaboration between startups and larger corporations			2
one such example is the @entity194 initiative that partners large companies with small businesses to provide corporate assistance with accounting support , legal services , marketing infrastructure and financial training			2
small companies often lack resources to take their business to scale			2
@entity207 can help catapult fledgling entrepreneurs to the next level			2
@entity151 's competitive position in the world will increasingly depend on our entrepreneurs			2
let 's not stop here			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0
