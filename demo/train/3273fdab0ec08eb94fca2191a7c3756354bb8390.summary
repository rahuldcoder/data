-- many tall fliers know : those precious exit row or bulkhead seats now often come with a price as airlines charge for the extra bit of legroom			1
that 's not sitting well with @entity9 , a 6 - foot - 7 - inch architect from @entity10 , @entity11 , who says they should be available to tall travelers without the added cost			1
@entity9 is on a mission to get @entity16 -- the airline he flies most -- to stop charging the fee			1
he filed a complaint with the @entity19 last year , but it was rejected in december on the grounds that he did n't fully qualify as a disabled person with a special condition , he said			2
@entity9 is vowing to appeal the decision			2
" it 's a penalty for tall people ... to pay for those seats -- they 're the only seats on the craft that we can fit into , " he said			1
@entity16 has not responded to a request for comment			0
@entity9 flies on the airline from @entity10 to @entity33 twice a year , but since there are no direct flights available , the journey usually requires four legs for a round - trip			2
he was always able to get a fairly comfortable seat at no charge , but that changed when the carrier implemented the fee about two years ago			0
@entity16 charges up to $ 50 for a coach seat with extra legroom on each flight , so @entity9 ends up paying $ 200 extra , he said			1
if his wife comes along and wants to sit next to him , the couple ends up paying $ 400 extra			0
@entity9 says it 's not fair that some obese passengers who ca n't fit into one seat are entitled to a free extra seat according to @entity54 law , but tall fliers are n't taken into consideration			1
" people have said to me , why do n't you fly first class ? well , it 's 10 times the price to fly first class , " @entity9 said			0
" other people have said , well , why do n't you just suck it up and sit down and shut up ? and i say , that 's fine for you because you 're 5 foot 2 and it 's all right			0
for tall people , it 's a little different			2
" @entity69 can be ' hell ' for tall passengers @entity9 worries about deep vein thrombosis , a potentially deadly condition that can develop when people sit still for a long time			0
when forced to sit in a regular coach seat , his knee is jammed against the person in front , he said , so he always ends up paying the fee for preferred seats			0
@entity9 says passengers who have a doctor 's letter that verifies their height and their need for more room should not have to pay extra			1
since @entity9 started his campaign , many other tall fliers have contacted him with messages of support			1
e-mail is " coming in every hour , " he said .			0
