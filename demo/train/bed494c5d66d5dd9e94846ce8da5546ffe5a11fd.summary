@entity0 , @entity1 , which can be a precursor to @entity12 's , researchers at @entity14 said thursday			1
the two - year clinical trial is the largest to study the effect of vitamin b on @entity10 and one of the first disease - modifying trials in the @entity12 's field to show positive results , the researchers said			1
the study followed 168 volunteers with mild memory problems , half of whom took a high - dose vitamin b tablet for two years and the other half who took a placebo			2
around one in six people age 70 and older has @entity10 and experiences problems with memory , language , or other mental functions , but not to a degree that interferes with daily life , the researchers said			1
around half of those with @entity10 develop dementia , mainly @entity12 's , within five years of diagnosis			1
certain b vitamins such as folic acid , vitamin b6 and vitamin @entity46 , are known to control levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the blood			2
high levels of homocysteine are associated with an increased risk of @entity12			1
researchers used mri scans to measure the rate of brain shrinkage over a two - year period			1
they found that on average , the brains of those taking a tablet that combined folic acid and vitamins @entity61 and @entity46 shrank at a rate of 0.76 percent a year , while those in the placebo group had a mean brain shrinkage rate of 1.08 percent			1
those with the highest levels of homocysteine benefited most , with atrophy rates on treatment that were half of those taking the placebo , researchers said			2
because the rate of brain shrinkage is known to be more rapid in those with @entity10 who go on to develop @entity12 's , it is possible that the vitamin treatment could slow down the development of the disease , they said			1
the researchers cautioned , however , that the relatively small number of participants and the short time span of the study meant more research is needed			2
" these are immensely promising results , but we do need to do more trials to conclude whether these particular b vitamins can slow or prevent development of @entity12 's , " said @entity86 of the @entity87 at @entity14 and a co-leader of the trial			1
" so i would n't yet recommend that anyone getting a bit older and beginning to be worried about memory lapses should rush out and buy vitamin b supplements without seeing a doctor			0
" the study was co-funded by the @entity101 , a @entity102 research charity			0
chief executive @entity103 said the results are important but also said they require further study			0
" the strong findings must inspire an expanded trial to follow people expected to develop @entity12 's , and we hope for further success , " she said			1
the @entity112 also raised concerns about the study noting the small size , the fact that it was conducted at a single research center and that one of the researchers involved has patents in this area and might , under certain circumstances , result in his financially benefit			0
" i do n't think age was an issue in the effectiveness of the intervention , in this study			0
only people with elevated homocysteine in the study showed benefit from the intervention			0
people with the lowest homocysteine levels in the study saw no benefit			0
so , b vitamins -- if it shown to be effective in further studies -- are unlikely to be beneficial for everyone , particularly if you already have healthy homocysteine levels , " said @entity138 , chief medical and scientific officer of the @entity140			2
" clearly , this is not enough data to go on			0
no conclusions can be drawn from this single study about use of @entity141 in @entity10 ( or alzheimer 's disease or related dementias )			1
no recommendations can or should be made to doctors or the public regarding use of b vitamins based on this study			0
no clinical or personal habits should be changed as a result of this article			0
" the findings were published in the september issue of @entity165 , the journal of the non-profit @entity167			0
the trial was supported by grants from @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity101 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 of the @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 , and @entity180 / @entity179 , which also donated the vitamin and placebo tablets .			0

@entity141 could halve the rate of brain shrinkage in those with mild cognitive impairment
@entity10 can be a precursor to @entity12 's and other forms of dementia
the benefits of certain b vitamins are already known
researchers caution that further and larger studies are needed to confirm the results
