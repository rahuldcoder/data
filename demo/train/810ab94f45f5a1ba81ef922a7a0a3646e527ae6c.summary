-- one of @entity2 's prettiest escapes is just a short skip from @entity4			1
all you need is three days and the right itinerary			0
@entity7 is a haven for artists and musicians			1
day 1 check in : the 220 - acre @entity11 ( 905 @entity12 ; 800/422 - 6524 or 805/646 - 1111 ; doubles from $ 400 ) was recently overhauled to the tune of $ 90 million			1
the result : 308 refreshed rooms , with four - poster beds and adobe fireplaces , plus the @entity18 , which hosts crafts classes and aromatherapy workshops			2
a full slate of activities such as golf , tennis and hiking mean you 'll never have to leave the property			2
in the heart of town , try the mission revival - style , all - suite @entity31 ( 301 n. @entity33 ; 866/646 - 7080 or 805/646 - 7080 ; doubles from $ 329 )			2
all nine rooms have super-plush beds and custom tile work ; three have vaulted ceilings			0
take a hike : of the 24 hiking paths that crisscross the valley , the 6 1/2 - mile @entity39 , which winds through the forested @entity40 , is the most beautiful -- and the most popular			1
to avoid crowds , opt for the @entity44 , with its dramatic valley views			0
grab a bite : dine by candlelight on the slate patio at @entity56 ( 502 @entity57 ; 805/640 - 1961 ; dinner for two $ 80 ) , a 15 - year - old local institution that serves @entity50 - inspired dishes made with organic produce from area farmers			1
hit the town : @entity7 's not known for its nightlife , but those looking to unwind can head to the art - filled @entity63 ( 308 e. @entity57 ; 805/646 - 1555 ) , a sultry little wine bar where residents and visitors alike mingle over glasses of regional favorites ; the 54 - bottle list includes three from the @entity7 itself			1
day 2 start fresh : begin the day at the low - key @entity71 ( 108 s. @entity33 ; 805/646 - 2723 ; breakfast for two $ 15 ) with just - baked blueberry muffins or decadent cinnamon - roll @entity75 toast			0
stop and shop : most of @entity7 's galleries and boutiques are located in and around the main street shopping arcade ( see where to shop )			1
if your tastes veer more to the homegrown variety ( artisanal soaps , candles , honey and breads ) , time your visit to coincide with @entity7 's @entity90 ( 300 e. matilija st. ) , held on sundays			1
get cooking : @entity91 trained at @entity94 's renowned @entity93 culinary school before opening the @entity95 ( 315 n. @entity33 ; 805/646 - 1124 ; classes from $ 30 ) in a wood - floored house			0
the assortment of international cooking classes features ingredients from the on - site garden			0
day 3 find your spiritual side : pilgrims , gurus and yogis have been drawn to these chaparral - covered hills for years			0
to see why , follow @entity108 to the serene @entity109 ( 10340 @entity110 ; 805/646 - 5508 ) , where rock platforms seem suspended over the valley			2
sweat it out : the 31,000 - square - foot spa at the @entity11 is the only one in the country to offer @entity116 -- a @entity118 mud treatment and guided meditation			1
more traditional treatments include several facials that use the inn 's natural skin - care line			2
treat yourself : small plates ( tomato - and - basil - stuffed artichokes ; smoked salmon on baguette ) make up the menu at @entity130 ( 457 e. @entity57 ; 805/640 - 7987 ; dinner for two $ 50 ) , a diminutive tapas bar inspired by chef @entity134 's travels in @entity135			0
with more than 60 wines , 20 vodkas and six beers on tap , it 's also the perfect place to round out the night -- and your visit			0
