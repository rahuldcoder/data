-- amid intense public attention , @entity2 's family remained quiet friday , except to say that their personal tragedy has raised a host of legal issues for the country			1
" we understand that our family 's personal tragedy presents important legal issues for the country as well for us , " said a statement from the family of the @entity12 student who committed suicide after an internet broadcast of him engaged in a sexual encounter with a man			1
" regardless of legal outcomes , our hope is that our family 's personal tragedy will serve as a call for compassion , empathy and human dignity , " the statement said			2
the legal closure to this case is far from apparent			2
it 's still not clear what charges @entity34 's roommate @entity33 and his friend @entity2 will ultimately face			1
the two @entity12 students have been charged with invasion of privacy for surreptitiously placing a webcam in @entity33 's dorm room and streaming online @entity34 's encounter with another man			1
@entity33 allegedly sent messages on @entity44 about the video and invited his friends to watch the video on @entity48			2
on september 22 , @entity34 jumped to his death from the @entity50 , which spans the @entity51 between @entity52 and @entity53			2
@entity12 student remembered as dedicated musician @entity53 prosecutors were determining friday whether additional charges , including bias , may be brought against @entity33 and @entity59			1
'' the initial focus of this investigation has been to determine who was responsible for remotely activating the camera in the dormitory room of the student and then transmitting the encounter on the internet , '' @entity61 prosecutor @entity60 said			1
'' now that two individuals have been charged with invasion of privacy , we will be making every effort to assess whether bias played a role in the incident , and , if so , we will bring appropriate charges , '' @entity70 said in a statement			1
what is clear , though , is that the @entity12 case has reignited debate over cyber incivility and whether tougher privacy laws are needed in a technologically advanced age when anyone can instantly disseminate information about another person with relative ease			1
@entity91 attorney @entity90 , who used to be a federal prosecutor , said that in many cases , it 's unlikely that anyone would serve significant jail time on invasion of privacy charges like @entity33 and @entity59 are facing			1
he said federal laws are stronger , but most cases are tried in state courts			1
gathering or viewing sexual pictures without consent is a fourth - degree crime , and broadcasting them is a third - degree crime			1
" state laws treat it like a nuisance , like graffiti on a street , " @entity90 said			1
he likened cyber-voyeurism to the illegal recording of phone calls and said : " it took a while for the law to catch up			2
now , wiretapping is illegal			2
" this summer , @entity118 reporter @entity117 appeared in @entity119 to express support for federal legislation to strengthen stalking laws			1
the man convicted of videotaping her through a hotel peephole was sentenced to two years in prison			2
her sentence , she said , was a lifetime of looking over her shoulder			0
the legislation would cover technologies such as electronic monitoring , spyware , bugging and video surveillance , said the bill 's sponsor , rep. @entity140 , @entity141			0
under current law , a victim must have a " reasonable fear of physical injury " before a case can be prosecuted , @entity140 said			0
sometimes , that is too late			0
all the facts in the @entity34 case are yet to surface			0
@entity33 's lawyer , @entity150 , told @entity152 newspaper that he did not see how , under @entity53 law , @entity33 and @entity59 could be held accountable for @entity34 's suicide			2
" to my knowledge , whatever the allegations are that justify the criminal complaints filed against the students , would not justify under either legal or common law any culpability for the suicide , " @entity150 told the newspaper			1
what is alleged is that on the evening of september 19 , @entity33 sent a message by @entity44 about his roommate , @entity34			0
" @entity166 asked for the room till midnight			0
i went into molly 's room and turned on my webcam			0
i saw him making out with a dude			0
" @entity33 tried to use the webcam again two days later , on september 21 , according to the @entity61 prosecutor 's office			0
" anyone with @entity48 , i dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12			0
yes it 's happening again , " @entity33 is believed to have tweeted			0
the next day , @entity34 , 18 , was dead			0
a mobile status update september 22 on a @entity181 page purportedly belonging to @entity34 said : " jumping off the gw bridge sorry			0
" " if the charges are true , these actions gravely violate the university 's standards of decency and humanity , " @entity12 president @entity183 said after the news of @entity34 's death broke			1
if @entity33 and @entity59 are convicted on the invasion of privacy charges , they face a maximum penalty of five years in jail			1
the punishment , said @entity199 privacy lawyer @entity198 , seems too lenient for the crime if it 's proved that @entity34 's suicide was triggered by the webcam video			1
@entity198 said the @entity12 incident reminded him of @entity204 , the @entity206 woman convicted on three misdemeanor counts of accessing protected computers without authorization			1
prosecutors argued that @entity211 illegally used the social networking site @entity213 to humiliate a 13 - year - old girl , who authorities said killed herself after receiving derogatory messages			2
in that case , @entity198 said , prosecutors found that there were not any existing laws that allowed them to charge @entity211 for the crime they said was committed			1
but in @entity222 , @entity198 said , revisions in the law will not come easy			0
" we also have to remember we have @entity227 laws , " he said			2
" what we really need is a new culture of cyber civility			0
" when fourth - graders are obtaining @entity181 pages , @entity198 said , parents can no longer afford to abdicate computer usage rules to the kids because they happen to be more technologically savvy than they are			0
@entity198 said service providers and institutions -- like @entity12 -- need to take more responsibility for online content			1
" there is n't an easy solution , " he said			0
" but hateful words do cause physical harm			0
the blog - brain barrier has been breached			0
" i 'm a privacy lawyer by profession , but i think we 're making a mistake if we depend just on the law			2
