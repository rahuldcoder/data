when he brought his camera to shoot the shrinking @entity4 city of @entity5 , you could say @entity8 photographer @entity7 took a few risks			1
" one : i do n't speak @entity4			1
and two : there 's a heavy @entity14 population in the area , " @entity7 told @entity6 over the phone last week			1
" i 'm black , so traveling to that part of @entity18 was , well , very intimidating , " he said with a chuckle			1
a generation ago when it was part of the @entity18 , @entity5 was held up as an example of a communist utopia			1
but when the @entity25 fell in 1989 and @entity18 reunited a year later , economic reform began choking the city of 72,000			1
first , jobs began disappearing -- then so did the residents			1
many left town looking for better opportunities			1
in 1991 , gangs attacked the homes of hundreds of immigrant workers there , including @entity36 and @entity37 , the @entity38 reported			2
authorities were forced to evacuate the terrified laborers to a military base			2
by the time @entity7 arrived last year , its population had withered to just 35,000			2
he wanted to document the residents ' painful economic struggle to survive			1
initially , he thought he 'd tell the story through the eyes of one displaced family			2
" but when i got there , i found the issue was much bigger , " @entity7 said			2
" everyone was going through it			2
" so @entity7 widened his editorial lens and painted a photographic landscape of a larger issue			2
it was n't simply residents ' survival at stake			1
the very existence of the town itself was clearly in jeopardy			1
several residents were moved out of their homes to make room for a coal mining operation			1
one of @entity7 's favorite photos shows an odd cardboard cutout in a window , showing happy residents smiling inside their doomed homes			1
" it promoted this perfect couple and a perfect world , when it really was n't perfect , " @entity7 said			2
" the town felt eerie , " he said , " like i was in some sort of horror film			1
" almost always , @entity7 and his @entity4 guide traveled around the city on bicycles			0
at one point they found themselves accosted by a group of men at a campsite			0
" they stepped in front of us and did the whole , ' @entity93 , ' putting their hands up and talking in @entity4 , " @entity7 recalled			0
his guide stepped in and began speaking with the men			0
" there was an argument , and they told us to get out of their way , " @entity7 said			0
" there was a lot of yelling			0
finally they moved and continued yelling things as we biked away			0
" " thinking back , it 's like , how did i do that ? " he laughed			0
@entity7 first fell in love with photography during his high - school days in @entity115 , after his best friend 's father loaned him a small point - and - shoot camera			1
social media follow @ @entity120 on @entity121 to join the conversation about photography			0
once he started playing with it , he could n't put it down			0
@entity7 's fascination with creating images led to a question , which later became a goal : how can i make a living as a photographer ? a college degree and internships at the @entity38 led to his current position as a photographer for @entity139 mayor @entity138			0
" it 's really cool ... i feel like the job presents different challenges that do n't exist in newspaper and other forms , " @entity7 said			1
" you have to find a way to make photographing someone at a podium interesting			0
" one day , he hopes to have a freelance photo / video company , where he can focus on his true passion : portraits			0
" that 's really what i love to do -- just capturing someone 's character in one frame , " @entity7 said			0
" i find it very character - revealing			0
" @entity7 is an @entity8 photographer based in @entity139			0
you can follow him on @entity163 , @entity121 , @entity164 and @entity165 .			0

@entity5 , @entity18 , has lost many residents since the @entity25 fell
it was once held up as an example of a communist utopia in @entity18
but over the years , many left town looking for better job opportunities
