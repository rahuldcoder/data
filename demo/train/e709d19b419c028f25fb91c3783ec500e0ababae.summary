@entity0 -- it 's not just any old talent show , it 's an institution -- an annual event that attracts an estimated global audience of 125 million			1
but to the uninitiated , the @entity6 can seem a mystifying cultural anomaly			1
each year , this relic of the post-war era inspires scores of camped - up performers to perform even camper songs in a self - conscious display of continental unity			0
but do n't let that put you off			1
from @entity19 to @entity20 , @entity21 to @entity22 , the show gathers an ever more devoted following each year -- and 125 million people ca n't all be wrong , can they ? so , if you have n't seen it -- and do n't know the first thing about what you 're missing -- keep reading			1
forgettable song , memorable outfit : the crazy clothes of @entity6 who competes ? forget the " @entity34 - " prefix			1
contestants can come from any member country of the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) which includes numerous @entity40 nations			0
bizarrely enough , the boundaries of the @entity38 are determined by the catchment area of telegraphy cables built in the 19th and 20th centuries , extending to @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and , let 's not forget , @entity49			1
@entity50 : @entity19 's not - so - guilty @entity6 pleasure why ? contrary to popular belief , the @entity6 was not forged in the flames of international unity			1
according to dr @entity58 , co-director of the @entity57 , the contest was set up for the practical purpose of testing the scope of new broadcast technology in the 1950s			1
" the whole gloss we put on it that it 's about uniting @entity64 is actually a misrepresentation , " she said			2
" @entity6 was set up not to unite @entity64 in song , but to test the latest broadcast technology , " she said			1
" the @entity38 needed content so thought , ' let 's create a song contest , ' " she said			1
the contest caught on , and has endured as a reliable ratings hit for the broadcasters of participating nations			2
so who chooses the acts ? the @entity38 is made up of broadcasters , not governments , and each year it is up to the participating broadcaster from each country to submit one act chosen through their own selection process			0
the prospect of a ready - made domestic audience and a studio full of premium - rate phone lines often proves an irresistible draw to broadcasters , many of whom conduct their selection through a national public telephone voting contest			2
in fact , some countries ' national finals produce a greater public frenzy than @entity6 itself			1
in @entity19 , @entity50 ( literally , @entity50 ) is the biggest entertainment event of the year , with 32 songs competing in stadia around the country to become the nation 's @entity6 entry			1
then what ? since the early 1990s there have been more countries eager to compete in the contest than would be sensible to include on one already marathon tv show			2
this prompted a wave of convoluted screening processes -- most of them short - lived -- until the @entity38 began broadcasting semi-finals in 2008			0
the semi-finals are conducted along the same lines as the final ( more on that later ) , except there 's two of them			2
each country performs their song and is judged by all the other countries in their semi-final group			0
unlike the final , however , the tally of votes won is kept under wraps , with the successful qualifiers simply announced while the losers are sent packing			0
the process applies to everyone except the previous year 's winner ( who earns the automatic right to host and compete in the next contest ) as well as the @entity6 of @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity20 and the @entity141 -- all of whom qualify automatically			1
that does n't sound fair			2
it is n't , but you get what you pay for			2
the @entity6 are the biggest financial contributors to the contest , and without them the high production costs simply would n't be met			1
so what happens on the big night ? one by one , the performers from each nation get on stage and sing their hearts out , often wearing a flamboyant outfit and performing a dance routine			0
until 1999 , each entry was obliged to sing along with a live orchestra , but since a rule change scrapped the requirement , no one ever does			0
live instrumentation is not permitted			0
this rule exists because there is n't enough time to wire the instruments during the short break between the songs			2
on the other hand , the backing tape ca n't have any vocals as live singing is ( for the time being ) what it 's all about			1
after the performances , there 's an intermission			2
convention dictates that this is an opportunity for the host nation to launch a long musical advertisement for itself			0
then the moment that everyone 's been waiting for ( and , it is said , the moment that most people tune in ) : the voting			0
finally ! so , how does that work ? countries award a set of points from one to eight , then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs			0
they ca n't vote for themselves and , for a much needed dose of sophistication , they must announce the score in both @entity199 and @entity138			0
until the late 1990s , a mysterious jury of music industry experts -- sequestered somewhere in the capital city of each participating nation -- were the contest 's soul arbiters			1
but since 1997 , when a handful of nations experimented with televoting -- giving people in those countries the opportunity to vote for their favorite songs over the phone -- the public choice has counted for half the final vote			0
in a surprisingly straightforward conclusion , the winner is quite simply the country with the most points			0
which countries have the strongest track record ? the notorious luck of the @entity222 seems to have turned on its head when it comes to @entity6			1
@entity225 is head and shoulders above the field with seven wins to its name , including a run of three consecutive victories in 1992 , 1993 and 1994			0
@entity138 , the @entity141 and @entity233 each have five wins to their credit			0
@entity19 now has five wins , and the @entity237 have four , while @entity45 and @entity238 have a respectable three wins each			0
do all the winners go on to fame and fortune ? no. one of the few " rules " that has remained consistent since the contest 's inception in 1956 is that winners are rarely heard from again			1
among the few notable exceptions are @entity248 , who won in 1974 with " @entity250 , " and @entity251 , who was imported from @entity253 to represent @entity254 in the 1988 contest .			0

the @entity6 is one of the most watched *non-sporting* events in the world
not just any old talent contest , it 's an institution with a devoted following
but many *outsiders* do n't get it , so @entity1 is here to help
