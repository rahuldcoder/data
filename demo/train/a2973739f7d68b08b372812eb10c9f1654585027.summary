@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 authorities most likely will announce the next search area for @entity8 on thursday , a senior @entity4 official told @entity2 on condition of anonymity wednesday			1
the search area will be " refined , " rather than brand new , and still will be in the southern @entity13 , where previous underwater explorations have failed to find the aircraft , the official said			1
@entity8 disappeared over @entity16 on march 8 , and searchers have found no trace of the @entity19 or the 239 people aboard , making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history			1
the flight had been scheduled to go from @entity25 , @entity4 , to @entity26			0
officials with three nations deeply involved in the search -- @entity4 , @entity30 and @entity6 -- approved the next search zone , the senior @entity4 official said			2
the @entity32 said this week that it 's been re-examining data and that the review could shift the search area south of the previous zone			0
searchers plotted initial search areas based in part on satellite data that they said indicated the plane flew to the southern @entity13			1
hopes of closure then were raised in early april , when a search team detected pings west of @entity6 that were initially thought to have come from the plane 's flight data recorders			0
but @entity6 authorities said an exhaustive search of the sea floor around the pings yielded no wreckage and ruled the area out as the aircraft 's final resting place			0
last week , a group of independent experts -- using satellite data publicly released in may -- also said it thought the missing aircraft was in the south @entity13 , but approximately hundreds of miles southwest of the previous search site			2
@entity2 's @entity61 contributed to this report .			0
