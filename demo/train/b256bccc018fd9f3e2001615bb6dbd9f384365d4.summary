-- if @entity3 makes bobsled history this season , her husband will have been the driving force			1
@entity7 , 30 , won @entity9 silver at @entity10 -- but had a whole new world open up to her last month			1
her sport decided , for the first time , to let women pilot four - man bobsleds			1
until now , women have been restricted to their own two - person event			2
@entity7 and @entity19 , the @entity20 friend and rival who beat her to women 's gold in @entity24 , had been dreaming of this change			1
" i did n't know if it would ever be possible to race and compete in four - man , " @entity7 told @entity0			1
" @entity19 and i had already been planning a match race -- just the two of us , each driving a four - man sled			1
" we had no idea the @entity35 ( bobsled 's world governing body ) would allow us to do it in official races			2
it 's crazy - fun , fast , and a whole new ball game			2
" in october , @entity7 got the news that four - man was opening up to female pilots and set about putting together her team			1
conveniently , she is married to an experienced bobsled brakeman			2
@entity47 met his future wife on the phone , in 2011 , when she was working for the @entity51 bobsled federation and he had just completed tryouts			1
their conversation was supposed to be about his paperwork			0
" it was crazy , " he recalled			0
" i was n't sure who she was , at all			0
but we were on the phone for hours , into the evening , and i was walking around laughing like i was on the phone to an old friend			0
" by 2013 , @entity3 was begging @entity35 boss @entity63 to pull some strings : he wanted to propose to @entity7 , as she then was , during the podium ceremony at the end of that year 's @entity67 , where @entity7 had won silver			1
@entity63 played along and @entity3 surprised @entity7 in front of the tv cameras			1
on april 24 this year , the two were married in a ceremony attended by @entity19 and other leading bobsledders			0
they even shared a secret bobsled handshake during their vows -- but neither had any idea they would be racing together , for real , six months later			1
' like driving a truck ' @entity3 , who spent several seasons in the @entity51 bobsled team , now works as a coach at the @entity82 in @entity83			1
when they heard about the chance to race together , the pair dropped everything			0
@entity3 found time to step away from his new job and back into the world of bobsled racing			1
" we 're recently married , we 're starting this whole new chapter of our lives -- with an apartment and all these things going on -- then we find out about this four - man thing and we 're scrambling to see how we can make it work , " said @entity7			1
trials to make the @entity51 four - man team were set for saturday , november 8 , in @entity101 , @entity102			1
by the start of that week , the @entity103 had assembled their team			2
@entity3 would be the pilot and @entity47 the brakeman , with rookie @entity107 and @entity108 filling out the sled			1
they would be up against the likes of @entity112 , who piloted the @entity51 to four - man gold at the @entity114 four years ago			1
the @entity115 had four days to prepare			0
" i had four days ' training , doing three runs each day , " admitted @entity7 , laughing			1
" and it really was a different experience			0
" i 'm so much more stable in corners than i am with a women 's ( two - person ) sled , but mistakes in the four - man sled -- because of the weight -- have much bigger results , so there is much less room for error			1
" people say a two - man sled is like driving a racecar , and a four - man is like driving a truck			1
and it feels that way			0
" the @entity103 had been together in a sled before			0
they once held an informal race against @entity51 team - mates @entity112 and @entity140 , dubbed the " co-coed championships , " which improbably ended in a tie			1
but what surprised @entity3 was the way his wife let no pressure show as she fought -- with minimal training -- for a place on the @entity51 four - man squad			1
" the closest thing i can relate it to is an @entity154 quarterback , " said @entity3			2
" you 'd have a @entity156 , you 'd have a @entity157 and you 'd have an @entity158			0
" pre-race , each driver has their signature style			0
a lot of the guys get really worked up , like entering a football game , but @entity3 's laughing the whole time , which is awesome			1
" it just takes a little getting used to			0
there are guys yelling and grunting and screaming , and @entity3 's just sitting around and laughing , ready to go			2
" fastest and strongest that laughter masked nerves			0
" the first run in a four - man sled was one of the most nerve - wracking i 've had in my life , " said @entity7			1
" you get this feeling in bobsled , like a combination of excitement , anxiety and pure nervousness , and you get that combination only very few times			2
" i remember having it the first time i drove down @entity187 's track			2
i assume i 'll have that feeling the first time we go to @entity190 , @entity191 , which is one of the more difficult tracks on tour			2
" and i definitely had that feeling going into driving a four - man			1
i got to the bottom and was laughing hysterically			0
" the end product ? third place at @entity51 national trials , behind @entity112 and two - time olympian @entity201			1
the top three get places on the @entity51 team			1
part one , at least			0
to reach the leading @entity209 circuit -- and race against @entity19 in what promises to be a historic four - man battle -- @entity7 needs to compete in five qualifying races			1
that means finding a substantial sum of money			0
" i was already planning on competing in four races on two tracks ( in @entity221 ) , and was hoping to get a waiver out of the last race , " she said after the selection races			2
" but that now looks unlikely , which means i have to go to @entity226 for a race in december			0
" i need about $ 10,000 to complete that trip			1
the goal now is to get to @entity226			0
" not only that , @entity7 will need a new lineup			2
her husband 's job in @entity83 means , despite helping her to qualify for the team , he almost certainly can not go with her			2
on the bright side , he still gets to feel involved			0
he coaches at the @entity82			0
she trains at the @entity82			0
one of his athletes is , you guessed it , his own wife			0
" we spend a lot of time together and he puts me through some pretty brutal workouts , " said @entity7			1
" when we go home , i 'm like , ' you could have given me an extra 10 seconds to rest , you know			0
it did n't have to be like that			0
' " her husband laughed off that assessment			2
" it 's more me having her do less , instead of more , " he said			0
" she 's one of the most motivated people i 've ever met in my life			0
" that 's one of the things that made me fall for her so far			0
" @entity7 , who spent the summer playing rugby sevens and still harbors an ambition to return to that sport for @entity266 , is convinced she can take on the men and win			2
" the biggest disadvantage is the weight			0
@entity112 , who is one of the top pilots in the world , weighs around 235 pounds , whereas i 'm 175 , " she said			2
" but i " m really not too concerned about it			0
@entity19 ( who also qualified for the four - man at her national trials ) and i are two of the fastest , and strongest , female pilots in the world			1
we have outpushed some of the men before and there 's no reason to think we ca n't hang with some of them now			0
" we are going to have to drive better than them , because of our slight push disadvantage against some of the top competitors , but we 're all about it -- and we 're all for it			0
