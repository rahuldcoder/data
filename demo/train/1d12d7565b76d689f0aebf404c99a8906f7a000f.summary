-- a recent report from the @entity3 @entity2 provides hard data that the first six months of 2012 were the hottest since records began being kept in 1895			1
according to @entity2 : " the january - june period was the warmest first half of any year on record for the contiguous @entity3			1
the national temperature of @entity10 was 4.5Â ° f above the 20th century average			2
" while those of us who work in the field of environmental policy and sustainability management believe that human - induced climate change is partially responsible for these trends , let 's ignore for a moment the causes of this problem and start thinking about what to do about the impact of extreme weather events			1
not only does @entity2 report that we are experiencing more extreme weather events , but the @entity29 's @entity28 reports that those events are having a greater impact than ever before			1
this is because the planet has more people than it used to			1
when i was growing up in the 1960s , we had about three billion people living on @entity37			2
today , we have more than seven billion			2
people are living in places they did not live in before , and some of the places that we live are quite vulnerable to destructive weather			1
additionally , with over half the planet residing in cities , we are living under conditions of higher population density			2
this means that when floods , fires , winds and earthquakes hit , more people are in harm 's way			2
extreme weather : expect to see more of it , scientists say even if the storms were not getting more intense , our growing population and patterns of development would guarantee that the costs of weather - related damage will continue to grow			1
we see the impact of new patterns of land use out @entity67 where wildfires have been raging for weeks			0
many of the homes that have been lost recently are in places where people did n't live a century ago			1
in the beach community where i have a summer home on the south shore of @entity78 , people are now building lavish homes close to the beach			2
in the old days , homes were built farther from the ocean to reduce the odds of damage from storms			0
we seem to think we are invulnerable to the forces of nature , at least until we learn the hard way that even modern buildings can be destroyed by storms , fires and earthquakes			0
think it 's hot ? imagine living here the policy implications of these trends are obvious			0
we should pay more attention to natural processes when we decide where to build our homes , businesses and infrastructure			0
here in @entity104 , the parkways we built by streams and rivers flood and must be closed during many storms			0
( commuters who drive on the @entity109 and the @entity110 know what i mean			0
) we need to devote more public resources to pay for emergency response and reconstruction from weather - related catastrophes			1
in fact , we should no longer deal with these events as if they are emergencies , but start to see them as routine events , requiring standard , programmed responses			0
this includes setting aside funds for fires and floods each year , just as @entity130 cities budget for blizzard clean - up			2
extreme heat in your area ? share with us on @entity135 we will also need to require homeowners and businesses to purchase higher levels of insurance coverage for weather - related damage			1
in this era when people seek smaller government and lower taxes , private insurance will be needed to pay the costs of reconstruction			1
these proposals and analyses do not require you to agree with the compelling scientific evidence that human activity is producing climate change			0
it could simply be a coincidence that the past six months were the hottest months on record			1
on the other hand , even if you are not one of the more than 100 @entity159 level climate scientists that work at @entity161 's @entity160 and even if you do not understand the physics of climate change or the computer models predicting global warming , common sense alone might lead you to think that human beings and their machines are making the planet warmer			0
news : wildfire victims face more than one tragedy if you doubt me , come to midtown @entity174 during an august heat wave and feel the blast of hot air from vents on buildings and the street			0
feel the heat generated by the engines of a truck or car traveling down @entity185 , and just multiply it by a billion , which according to @entity186 , is the number of motor vehicles now on the roads of our planet			0
do you really think all these machines have no impact on this planet 's resilient but still fragile ecosphere ? i do not want to turn off these machines			0
i like air conditioning , autos and digital media as much as anyone			0
but a prudent response to the extreme weather we are already experiencing would be to be to see it as a warning			1
we need to accelerate the transition to a sustainable , renewable economy			0
we need to build our communities ' capacities to predict and respond to weather emergencies and to rebuild after they are over			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

@entity2 reports the past 12 months were the hottest since record - keeping began
@entity213 says effects of extreme weather are *indisputable* , whatever the cause
more and more people live in places especially vulnerable to rough weather , he says
@entity213 : government and *industry* must prepare for the *inevitability* of weather disasters
