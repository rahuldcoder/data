-- in a presidential election dominated by @entity5 's conservative ruling clerics and @entity7 's followers , a virtual female candidate named " @entity2 " rose to compete with the all - male ensemble approved by the country 's @entity9			1
" @entity2 is created to demand fair and free elections and seek respect for our basic human rights , especially for women who were rejected to run in this election ; and others who ca n't have their voices heard in @entity5 , " said @entity11 , executive director of the @entity13 - based non-profit organization @entity12 , which ran her online campaign			1
" the goal of the @entity2 campaign is to expose a corrupt and exclusive political landscape through satire , " said @entity11 , adding that he believed creative opposition tactics could help revive people 's hopes and dreams			2
@entity12 said @entity2 received almost 2,000 virtual votes			1
her campaign also had nearly 4,000 @entity35 supporters , with many from @entity5			1
watch : @entity5 cartoon popular candidate on the web @entity39 -- an @entity5 - @entity13 writer -- and @entity41 , an @entity42 illustrator based in @entity43 , had previously created @entity2 as the main character in an online graphic novel aimed at blurring the line between the virtual space and the real world and showing support for democracy in @entity5			1
in their novel , @entity2 searches for her young son " @entity53 " -- a " @entity56 " activist -- in the aftermath of the much - disputed 2009 @entity5 elections			1
she eventually finds him dead in " @entity57 , " @entity59 's largest cemetery			0
@entity39 and @entity41 were inspired by the true events of the 2009 post presidential election , including the fatal shootings of @entity63 and @entity64 , whose deaths at peaceful anti-government protests became a rallying cry for the opposition and human rights groups			2
" we did not have to bury the body and the dreams of another generation of @entity5 youth in dust and dirt			2
there had to be some ways of turning all that death back into life , some way of defying gravity and turning time around -- for me , that way was to tell the story of a burial in @entity57 , " @entity39 told @entity0			0
websites associated with @entity5 's government attacked the @entity2 campaign for presidency as a " highly sophisticated and professionally organized plot " launched by the @entity92 and zionist agents			1
@entity39 said @entity2 's campaign gained momentum in may , as the international media noticed this fictional character particularly after almost 700 candidates -- including 30 women -- were rejected during the @entity9 's vetting process			1
the council is made up of six clerics and six lawyers and operates under the oversight of @entity7 , @entity5 's @entity105			1
from all those registered , only eight were given the opportunity to run in @entity5 's eleventh presidential election and replace the outgoing president , @entity110			1
" it 's a slap to the people 's face , when a group of 12 old men , almost all of them over 70 , decide who gets to run for presidency ; and determine the faith of a society -- especially , a society where woman are arguably its most vibrant , energetic and bright sector that make up 60 % of its educated class , " said @entity114 , an @entity5 scholar who heads the @entity115 at @entity116			2
in the days leading up to @entity5 's presidential election , @entity128 , one of the 12 members of the @entity9 denounced women 's right to run for president			1
the semi-official @entity5 @entity134 news agency quoted @entity128 as saying the " law does not approve " of a woman in @entity5 's highest elected office and that this is " not allowed			1
" in march , the @entity138 said the 1979 revolution that brought @entity5 's current regime to power was " in many respects a point of ' no return ' for women 's rights			2
" " women suffer from severe oppression , whether it 's discrimination in universities by the governing system , or on the street being harassed by the ' morality police ' about what they are wearing and whether or not their head scarves are covering enough of their hair and abiding the regime 's @entity160 rules and regulations , " said @entity146 , a student activist who finished her master 's degree in communication in @entity59			0
recently , @entity146 and her husband @entity163 took refuge in the @entity13 as her husband was an outspoken reformist and activist in @entity5			0
" the goal with @entity2 's campaign is to move our basic fundamental human , civil and social rights from dreams to reality ; because by creating our reality , even if not currently political viable , we are introducing possibilities to change the political landscape of today and tomorrow , " said @entity11			1
a political landscape that former female parliamentarian @entity181 said for the past eight years had " oppressed people , especially women and youth through a strong militant governing body			0
" @entity181 served from 2000 - 2004 and was the first to resign when the @entity9 banned more than 2,000 reformist candidates from the seventh parliamentary election			0
in 2005 , she moved to the @entity13			0
however , @entity181 said that the election of moderate politician @entity187 to the presidency had " created a change in the political landscape			0
" @entity187 was backed by former reformist president @entity189 and @entity5 's political power - player @entity190			2
during his campaign , he strongly criticized the conservatives and promised social , political and cultural reforms for women			0
he also promised to create a @entity196 to help address women 's issues			0
" @entity187 now has the ability to shift the socio - political and cultural landscape of @entity5 from the old didactic and heavily militant ambiance into a liberal and reformist society that allows change and reform for everyone , especially women , " @entity181 said			0
" i just wanted a reformist , someone different , someone who is not a lunatic conservative , " a 25 - year - old university student , @entity208 , told @entity0 via @entity35			2
@entity208 lives in @entity59 and asked that her surname not be used			0
" you should have seen the city today [ june 15 ] , for the past eight years you could smell oppression everywhere ; but today , there was liberty , a small sense of freedom , people were genuinely smiling and loud music was no longer banned , you could feel that people were starting to believe again , " she said			0
but with the @entity5 election fading away in the real world , @entity11 and the campaign plan to use @entity2 's virtual celebrity to continue to campaign against social and political inequalities for women ; and call for democracy and reform in @entity5 -- an aspiration that this virtual character says she owes to the " children of @entity5 and those we lost like @entity63 , @entity53 , and @entity64			1
" " @entity2 exists for those of us that have nowhere else to turn , to give us a vote for what we believe in , " said @entity11 .			0
