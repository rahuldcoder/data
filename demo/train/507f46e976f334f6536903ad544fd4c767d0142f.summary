in the mid- 1990s , conditions were right for @entity1 to build the multilingual economy of the future			1
a slumping economy needed a boost			0
a remarkably multilingual population -- including millions of @entity8 speakers -- was already in place			1
bilingual education programs -- pioneered and developed in @entity11 over the prior three decades -- were already being established in school districts from @entity14 to @entity15			1
but in 1998 , with globalization knocking ever more loudly on its door , @entity1 voted instead to pass a ballot measure known as @entity19 that imposed wide - reaching restrictions on bilingual education , effectively banning it			1
they were convinced that @entity1 's language diversity -- especially its @entity8 -- was a problem to be eradicated , rather than a resource to be developed			1
in the 16 years since the measure was approved , @entity1 has largely squandered one of its most valuable economic and cultural resources			1
millions of @entity8 - speaking immigrant students lost the opportunity to learn or retain valuable literacy skills in @entity8 while they acquired @entity32			1
and , millions of @entity1 - born @entity33 who enrolled in school with the gift of native bilingualism would later leave school unable to read and write in @entity8			1
fewer latinos will speak @entity8 , more non-latinos will , report says when bilingual education mostly disappeared from @entity1 in 1998 , so did millions of opportunities , economic and otherwise			1
today , @entity19 is once again in the news , as @entity1 state sen. @entity44 has proposed legislation designed to repeal it			2
this is especially important for the state because come march , the @entity47 population is projected to surpass that of whites to become the single largest ethnic group			0
but as we look back on the banning of bilingual education in @entity1 -- and anticipate its end -- we should n't lose sight of the broader context in which restrictive language policies have found traction in educational settings in the @entity62			1
a guide to raising bilingual children in the mid- 19th century , the department of the @entity62 federal government , known as the @entity67 , established a series of @entity32 - only boarding schools , whose purpose was to " acculturate " or " save " @entity72 , by stamping out the use of languages such as @entity75 , @entity76 , and @entity77			1
they were remarkably successful in doing so			0
later , in the first part of the 20th century , anti-german hysteria in the era of @entity81 resulted in the systematic closing of long standing @entity85 language schools			2
@entity85 - speaking communities in the @entity62 never recovered , and , for the most part , no longer exist			2
up until the mid- 20th century , schools in parts of @entity90 segregated @entity92 - @entity62 students from whites , routinely shaming , punishing , and expelling them for speaking @entity8 at school			1
a moment i 'll never forget from my research there was when an elderly woman described the consequence of speaking @entity8 at school as a child			2
she told me , " @entity104			0
" ( they kicked us out			0
yes , they used to expel you from school			0
) the tears welled up in her eyes as she spoke			0
but the examples are not only from the past			0
recently , the principal of a public middle school in @entity118 , @entity90 , made an announcement over the school 's intercom system that the use of @entity8 would be banned at school , effective immediately			1
latino students , approximately half of the student body , also reported being told by teachers they would be punished for speaking @entity8 on school grounds			2
restrictive language policies toward @entity8 in @entity62 schools are especially common , in part because the nature of @entity8 and @entity8 speakers in this country remain deeply misunderstood among the general public			1
consider how the following myths about @entity8 in the @entity62 differ from empirical reality			1
myth no. 1 : latinos in the @entity62 do not want to / can not / will not learn @entity32 social science data show that @entity33 learn @entity32 at a rate as fast or faster than that of prior immigrant groups			0
in over a decade of studying language in @entity62 @entity47 communities , i have yet to meet a single young person who has not desperately wanted to know @entity32 , nor have i found a single reference to such a phenomenon in the work of my fellow linguists			2
myth no. 2 : speaking @entity8 at school detracts from learning @entity32 this belief is premised on a false dichotomy that pits knowing @entity8 against learning @entity32			0
fortunately , for non-language - impaired children , knowing one language is not a roadblock in the acquisition of another			0
in fact , some evidence suggests that policies restricting the use of the home language actually have negative effects on the acquisition of literacy skills in @entity32			0
myth no. 3 : children will simply learn @entity8 in the home people tend to think language can be acquired just by receiving enough inputs to " crack the code " -- that hearing mom and dad speaking @entity8 is enough			2
but language is much more than the sum of its rules			0
language is also the identity you make in it -- the experiences , the relationships , and the memories that come from using the language across many contexts			0
in many @entity62 @entity47 communities , receptive bilingualism -- a pattern in which parents speak to children in @entity8 , who respond in @entity32 -- is common			1
while comprehension is an important language skill , speech production and literacy skills are equally necessary for jobs in the growing bilingual labor market			0
myth no. 4 : @entity8 is taking over @entity62 schools while it is true that the overall number of @entity8 speakers in the @entity62 is expected to increase , this is due to new immigration			1
@entity62 language history shows that immigrant languages are mostly or completely lost by the third generation			2
research shows that @entity8 is being lost across generations at roughly the same rate as previous immigrant languages such as @entity217 and @entity218			0
lifelong bilinguals may have more efficient brains looking back , it 's clear that restrictive language policies such as @entity19 have been problematic all along , but in our era of globalization , education that seeks to eradicate the native bilingualism of its students makes less sense than ever in economic and sociocultural terms			2
now with some 45 million speakers and a 500 - year history , @entity8 in the @entity62 is an economic and cultural resource to be cherished and carefully cultivated , not dismantled one generation after the next			1
it is therefore time to thoroughly rethink the system that takes @entity8 away from young children , only to feebly reintroduce it to them 10 years later as " a foreign language			2
" at that point it is mostly too late			0
what is instead now desperately needed is linguistically informed education policy that supports the acquisition and maintenance of both languages for all students who want to develop bilingual fluency			0
we need not force our students to choose one language or the other -- they can have both .			0

*law* banning bilingual education in @entity1 schools may be overturned by new bill
" @entity1 has squandered one of its most valuable economic and cultural resources "
language and @entity8 speakers are deeply misunderstood among the general public
