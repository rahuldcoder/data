-- take a look outside your window			0
chances are the air you 'll see is far cleaner than it was decades ago			2
since 1980 , levels of ozone pollution — one of the main ingredients in smog — have fallen by 25 % in the @entity12 , while nitrogen dioxide has fallen by 55 % and sulfur dioxide by 78 %			1
the change is visual too — the smog - obscured skies that were once a constant backdrop to cities like @entity20 in the 1960s and ' 70s are far less common			1
it 's easy to assume that @entity12 won the war on air pollution , and to look with pity on developing cities like @entity26 and @entity27 where the air is still poisoned			1
there 's just one problem with that sense of satisfaction : the data does n't back it up			0
according to a new report from the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , nearly 148 million @entity12 live in areas where smog and soot particles have led to unhealthy levels of pollution			1
that means that for almost half of all @entity12 , simply breathing can be dangerous			1
even worse , the report shows that some aspects of air quality have been deteriorating over the past few years in many cities — from 2010 to 2012 , ozone worsened in 22 of the 25 biggest metropolitan areas , including cities like @entity51 and @entity52			1
" air pollution is not just a nuisance or the haze we see on the horizon ; it 's literally putting our health in danger , " @entity53 , senior policy director of the @entity36 in @entity54 , told the @entity55			1
" we 've come a long way , but the status quo is not acceptable			0
" the news is far from all bad			0
thanks in part to the retirement of a number of older coal - fired power plants , levels of particulate pollution — soot , in other words — have been dropping in recent years , with cities like @entity76 and @entity77 recording their lowest levels yet			2
and historically , we 're far better off — as @entity81 notes over at @entity82 , air pollutants as a whole have fallen 72 % since the @entity83 was passed in 1970 , even as the economy , population and energy use have all risen			2
but as the @entity36 report makes clear , some of that progress is being lost , in part thanks to climate change — one environmental challenge we 're very much not meeting			1
rising levels of ozone pollution have been linked to warmer temperatures , which will make it that much tougher to fight smog in the future			2
and the government could have done more — in 2011 , president @entity99 went against the recommendations of the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) and rejected a proposal that would have tightened the ozone standard to between 60 and 70 parts per billion			0
( the level is currently at 75 ppb , set by former president @entity107 , who was not exactly known as an environmental paragon			0
) those regulatory battles matter because it 's becoming increasingly clear that healthy air is a moving target			2
the more scientists learn about the health impacts of air pollution , the more dangerous it appears — even at comparatively low levels			2
last october , the @entity118 ( @entity118 ) officially declared air pollution to be a carcinogen , connecting it directly to lung cancer as well as bladder cancer			2
and bad air does n't just hurt the lungs — a raft of studies have connected air pollution , especially soot , to cardiovascular disease , even triggering heart attacks			1
even autism has been linked to pollution			0
in march , the @entity118 estimated that outdoor air pollution caused 3.7 million premature deaths globally in 2012 — nearly three times the number of people who die each year from tuberculosis			1
climate change gets most of the environmental attention , with reason — its effects are already being felt , and it has the potential to radically change our world for the worse			1
but air pollution is sickening and killing millions of people around the world right now			0
and unlike global warming , the technological and regulatory solutions to conventional air pollution already exist			0
that 's why it was good news tuesday when the @entity12 @entity153 upheld the @entity102 's ability to control coal - fired power - plant emissions in 28 states			1
the decision excited greens because it indicates the court will eventually back even more controversial carbon regulations that the @entity99 @entity161 is busy formulating now , but the regulation that was upheld — the @entity164 — will prevent an estimated 45,000 deaths a year from conventional air pollution once it 's in place			0
air pollution remains stubbornly difficult to eliminate , in part because of the vagary of the wind itself , which separates the victims of pollution from its source			0
as justice @entity173 wrote in her decision yesterday , quoting from the @entity175 : " the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound therof , but canst not tell where it cometh , and whither it goeth			0
" but if we ca n't control the air , we can control what we put into it — and protect ourselves .			0

report : nearly 148 million live in @entity12 areas with unhealthy smog and soot
some aspects of air quality have been *deterioriating* , the @entity36 says
climate change presents a *formidable* *obstacle* to progress
