-- by july 20 , a historic deal may be reached to resolve the @entity3 nuclear standoff			1
the choice @entity5 will face at that point is whether to lift sanctions on @entity3 in order to extract valuable and irreversible nuclear concessions from @entity10			1
any debate over whether to exchange sanctions for limitations to @entity3 's nuclear program , however , would be incomplete at best and misleading at worst if it does not address the cost of this policy			1
surprisingly , the @entity5 government has not conducted any study to assess the cost of its two decades - long policy of sanctioning @entity3			2
according to our study , based on an econometric gravity model that commonly is used to measure trade patterns , the @entity5 is by far the biggest loser of all nations enforcing sanctions on @entity3			1
from 1995 to 2012 , the @entity5 sacrificed between $ 134.7 and $ 175.3 billion in potential export revenue to @entity3			2
but the human cost is even more surprising			0
based on the @entity31 's annual report on jobs supported per billion dollars of exports , this lost export revenue translates into between 51,043 and 66,436 job opportunities lost per year on average			0
in 2008 alone , as many as 214,657 to 279,389 job opportunities were relinquished			0
@entity37 and @entity38 are likely the biggest losers in terms of lost job opportunities , due to their size as well as the strength of their industries in areas attractive to the @entity3 economy -- oil and gas , automobiles , green energy , and telecommunications to name a few			0
yet , these are conservative numbers			0
the model only captures lost export revenues and does not take into account secondary effects of sanctions such as higher oil prices to the broader @entity5 economy			2
nor does it account for how lower @entity3 gdp and imports -- as a result of sanctions -- further suppresses @entity3 's ability to absorb exports from the sanctioning countries			1
consequently , the full cost to the @entity5 economy is likely even higher than the numbers listed here			0
@entity5 is not alone in losing export revenue and job opportunities as a result of the @entity3 sanctions			1
sanctions cost the @entity75 states more than twice as much as the @entity5 in terms of lost trade revenue between 2010 and 2012			2
@entity78 was hit the hardest , followed by @entity79 and @entity80			0
it is not uncommon that cost becomes a secondary factor when devising national security policy			0
but as @entity5 and @entity3 diplomats try to negotiate nuclear deal in @entity88 together with their @entity75 , @entity90 and @entity91 partners , the question is not whether sanctions have been justified			1
rather , the question is whether sanctions should be exchanged for blocking @entity3 's uranium and plutonium pathways towards a nuclear weapon			1
these are pathways , incidentally , that can not be bombed			0
as former @entity105 chief @entity104 famously said , " you can bomb their facilities , but you can not bomb their knowledge			0
" opponents of a nuclear deal argue that intensified sanctions provide a more effective route to halting @entity10 's nuclear activities			1
they also fear that sanctions relief will give @entity3 a get - out - of - jail - free card and enable it to restart its nuclear program at a later stage			1
the arguments in favor of sanctions , or against a deal that entails sanctions relief , are debatable			0
in the words of @entity5 president @entity124 , the idea that @entity3 would simply surrender to @entity5 demands due to the economic pressure of sanctions " does not reflect an honest understanding of the @entity3 people or the @entity3 regime			2
" in addition , continuing sanctions may break the international coalition against @entity3			2
lawmakers on @entity133 have heard directly from @entity134 that if a reasonable deal is reached , the @entity75 will not accept the cost of sanctions even if @entity138 rejects the nuclear deal			1
it will be @entity138 , not @entity134 , that will break the transatlantic coalition by clinging on to sanctions at the expense of a nuclear resolution , the @entity134 have said			0
if the @entity124 administration in the next few days manages to secure a deal over @entity3 's nuclear program , some in @entity146 will ask whether the deal is good enough to " give up sanctions			1
" but the @entity5 public must also ask themselves if the cost of sanctions to the @entity5 economy is worth shouldering if other options exist .			0

a july 20 *deadline* to reach a *permanent* deal on @entity3 's nuclear program is *looming*
if a deal is reached , the @entity5 will have to decide whether to lift sanctions , *authors* say
they say the @entity5 is the most negatively *impacted* of the nations *imposing* sanctions
the @entity75 will likely end sanctions if a reasonable deal is reached , regardless of the @entity5 , they say
