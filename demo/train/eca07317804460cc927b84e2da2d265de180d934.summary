what is it about winning streaks and racing drivers called @entity5 ? first there was @entity8 's @entity7 with nine consecutive @entity10 titles between 2004 and 2012			1
then came @entity12 's @entity11 who dominated @entity13 for four straight seasons ending in 2013			2
today , it 's the turn of another @entity8 , @entity16 to leave the opposition trailing in his wake			1
the 31 - year - old @entity20 driver has dominated rallying over the past two seasons winning back - to - back world titles alongside co-driver and compatriot @entity25			1
@entity16 may have an unimpeded view at the front of the field now , but the road ahead has n't always been so clear			2
" of course it was not a straight or easy way to the top , " @entity16 told @entity0 's human to @entity31			2
" it 's never like that in any sport for any professional or any champion , i guess			2
i had to fight hard to ( overcome ) some difficult times but i have to say that the progression was very quick			0
" hurtling through narrow forest roads , up and down mountain passes and skidding around dirt tracks at speeds routinely approaching 200 kph ( 125 mph ) is where he 's happiest			0
but like his compatriot @entity7 , @entity16 was a late bloomer in the sport , only starting his career at the age of 22			1
" i really love rally because of the diversity of the sport			2
we are racing all over the world on lots of different surfaces -- we are driving on gravel , on tarmac , on snow			0
we always have to adapt and face very different situations			0
" you need to have a lot of skills of adaptation because we are always facing the unknown -- we are never quite sure what 's going to happen around the next corner			0
" born in @entity67 , a small village in the foothills of the @entity70 , @entity16 developed a love of rallying at an early age watching competitors in the @entity74 speed up and down the mountains near his home every january			1
" my childhood dream was to become a racing driver for sure , but it was really looking like an unreachable dream for me ( because ) i was coming from a very modest area			0
" my parents did their best ... but motorsport was obviously impossible to ( break into ) because it was too expensive , " he says			0
his father gave him a rally kart when he was eight years old , but with no family money or sponsorship to fuel his ambitions further , @entity16 got on with other things training to become a car mechanic , qualifying as ski instructor and gaining a reputation as a handy boules player too			1
there were forays into racing arenas , but only as a volunteer fire marshal at the @entity98 -- a cheaper way to get a ringside seat , he says			0
his life would change though in 2005 when he won the @entity102 , an annual talent - spotting contest run by the @entity104 ( @entity104 )			1
with the @entity104 's financial backing , @entity16 grabbed the opportunity with both hands , winning the @entity108 ( a competition for aspiring rally drivers ) in 2007 -- the first of many triumphs alongside co-driver @entity113			1
the pair won the @entity116 the following year before stepping up to the @entity10 ( @entity117 ) proper in 2009 , joining @entity118 -- the home of @entity7 , who had just won his fifth straight world title for the @entity70 team			1
unfazed , @entity16 was soon nipping at the heels of his illustrious teammate and a first podium finish in the second race of 2010 ( in @entity126 ) was followed by a maiden @entity10 win in @entity128 later that year			1
" it was for sure a great moment			0
i always mention every step which brought me to the top , where it was very important to my career ( but ) obviously the first victory is a special moment that you remember forever			0
" @entity16 secured third place overall in 2011 , but the season was soured by a clash of egos with @entity7 and the pair 's increasingly fractious relationship came to a head in a row over team orders at the @entity146 in @entity147			2
the spat ultimately saw @entity16 jump ship to @entity20 helping the @entity12 manufacturer develop its @entity117 car during 2012 before returning to racing with a bang in 2013			1
he won nine of the 13 races , clinching his maiden world title on home soil in @entity157 before winning a further eight races on his way to world title number two in 2014			1
victory in last year 's wrc was particularly satisfying after a horrific high - speed crash in @entity12 had threatened to derail the defense of his crown			2
he and @entity25 walked away unscathed after plowing through a safety barrier -- @entity16 later blamed himself for the error citing a lack of focus brought about by concerns over proposed rule changes to the sport			2
" that big crash i took like a wake - up call that i had really to react because i put myself in danger , @entity25 as well			0
we really had a big accident and that was really the time to react and do something , " @entity16 told @entity175 at the end of last year			1
it was testament to his mental resolve that he bounced back so quickly , winning three of the four remaining rallies clinching the title in the final race at the @entity188 in @entity189			0
" second place is a first loser , " he replies when asked what his motto for life might be			0
" i 'm not the first one to say it but i 've always been a fighter , a competitor whatever i was doing in life			1
( i do n't react ) the best way when i lose , so when you are like that you have to fight to become the first one			0
" @entity16 has begun 2015 where he left off last year , driving to victories at the opening two races in @entity204 and @entity205			1
the sequence extends his winning streak of rallies to four and few will be betting against the flying @entity8 making it five in a row at the next rally in @entity126 in march			2
his rivals may hope that his recent marriage to @entity12 tv presenter @entity215 may soften his desire to win , but with most rally drivers peaking in their 30s , @entity16 is perhaps just beginning a run of success that could rival @entity7 's historic sequence of titles			1
but as he 's learned from driving a car at breakneck speed , it pays to concentrate on the stretch of road immediately up ahead			0
" i do n't have such a long plan in front of me -- i just take the year , one after each other			0
" for sure , i want to race a few more years but to be honest i really do n't know , i always think about the future dreaming about family , children , being a normal person again			0

@entity16 is the reigning world rally champion
the @entity8 won back - to - back world titles in 2013 and 2014
the 31 - year - old started his rallying career when he was 22 years old
" i 've always been a fighter , a competitor whatever i was doing in life , " he says
