-- first some full disclosure : former president @entity2 has been pretty good to me			1
he gave me in - person interviews for my last book and a forthcoming one on the end of greatness in the presidency			0
and every time we 've met , our conversations have been friendly and productive			0
but having worked on the @entity12 negotiations for more than a few years and still laboring under the notion that wrongheaded assumptions and conclusions ought to be redressed , i ca n't help but weigh in on the former president 's criticism of both president @entity18 's and former secretary of state @entity20 's handling of the @entity23 - @entity22 negotiations			1
@entity2 's brief comments raise two important issues worth examining			1
@entity2 's idea that the president ought to jump in and get in the middle of the @entity23 - @entity22 negotiations and that @entity29 should be somehow blamed for not taking on the peace process are dead - on inaccurate			1
i 've been critical of @entity18 and @entity29			1
but blasting them for failure to leap into the throes of a broken peace process is n't a valid criticism			1
what @entity2 has done is to allow his own passion for resolving the @entity22 issue and his own experience in peacemaking during the late 1970s to skew his view of what is required now in the way of presidential involvement			1
right now , the @entity46 talks are hardly ready for prime time , and until they 're much farther along @entity18 should keep his distance			1
@entity2 's brief paragraph of comments in his longer interview in @entity52 takes shots at @entity18 and @entity29 from two different directions			1
other than his well - deserved expression of admiration for @entity46 , just about everything in that paragraph is wrong			2
first is the charge that @entity46 is " having a difficult time operating pretty much on his own			2
" here 's a news flash for you			0
this is the @entity23 - @entity22 issue -- it 's the mother of all migraine headaches and root canals operations			0
every secretary of state and president who has ever dealt with it has had a difficult time			0
indeed , none has even come close to resolving it			0
@entity46 is only the latest in a fairly long line of would - be peacemakers			2
and the fact is even with the current crisis in the talks , ( likely to be resolved on the basis of more process but little peace ) he 's actually kept this thing afloat longer than anyone would have believed			2
implicit in @entity2 's charge , though , is the idea that @entity46 's travails are related almost entirely to the fact that @entity18 has not played a central role in the enterprise so far			1
much of @entity2 's mediator addiction flows from his own experience in brokering @entity94 - @entity23 peace			1
let 's be clear @entity2 accomplished in 1978 and 1979 remains a truly important and consequential act of @entity98 diplomacy			2
@entity2 took risks in bringing @entity94 president @entity100 and @entity23 prime minister @entity101 to @entity102 in 1978 , and he was relentless and skillful in his brokering of those accords and the @entity94 - @entity23 peace treaty that followed in march of the following year			1
but presidential involvement then was both warranted and critical to the task at hand			0
@entity2 had two strong leaders who were serious about making a deal			2
he had a focus on @entity94 - @entity23 peace that both @entity100 ( reluctantly ) and @entity101 ( happily ) were prepared to separate out from the more complicated @entity22 issue			0
he had negotiators below the level of the two leaders on each side who were prepared to play key roles in facilitating , not complicating , the negotiations			0
in short , then the peace process was ready for prime time			1
after all , @entity100 in november 1977 in one of the most extraordinary acts of statesmanship in the 20th century had undertaken a trip to @entity126 and in the process fundamentally altered the shape of the conflict			0
today , the @entity23 - @entity22 issue remains largely frozen			0
should @entity46 's effort progress further and the gaps on the core issues of the conflict -- borders , security , @entity126 , refugees -- narrow significantly , it would be worth a significant push by @entity18 to close them			1
indeed , an @entity23 - @entity22 agreement , let alone a conflict - ending one , is n't going to be possible without presidential involvement of a major caliber			0
but to spend presidential currency now , to make the president part of the political furniture by throwing him into a semihopeless process not only does n't make sense , it would undermine presidential credibility			1
@entity152 was only partly right			0
ninety percent of success in life is showing up			0
but it 's showing up at the right time			0
as for @entity2 's charge that @entity29 " took very little action to bring about peace " and that " it was only @entity46 's coming into office that reinitiated all these important and critical issues , " that 's also wrong and unfair			1
during her term as secretary of state , @entity29 dealt with perhaps the most controlling foreign policy president since @entity166			1
@entity18 dominated -- he did n't delegate			1
all of the consequential issues were run out of the @entity168 , including the so - called peace process			1
and that had nary a chance of getting started because the president chose to focus on @entity23 settlement activity instead of what might be required to reach an actual agreement -- not that such an agreement could have been reached then anyway			0
it was true that @entity29 was likely risk - averse on the @entity22 issue			2
she was smart enough to know the climate was hardly amenable to an agreement			0
it 's also true @entity46 is risk - ready			2
unlike his predecessor , the arc of his prospective elected political career is descending ; @entity29 's is ascending			0
if she runs for president , she has to deal with the consequences of actions she took regarding the @entity12			2
and so @entity46 is prepared to be active			0
but that 's because the president is ready to let @entity46 engage			2
you have a second - term president more focused on the middle class as a legacy , not on the @entity12			2
and so it 's important that he has a secretary of state who is prepared to take on and manage all the headaches the president ca n't or does n't want to			0
it 's truly unfair to blame @entity29 for a first term peace process that never was and almost certainly never could have been			1
@entity2 's views on the @entity12 are likely driven by many things : his own success there and the lack of success of all of his predecessors on issues he cares deeply about and that are important to @entity98 national interests			1
but none of that should fundamentally obscure the main issue			0
@entity2 succeeded in the peace process because the parties themselves were prepared to own it and take the decisions necessary to make it work			1
that is not yet the case today			0
the primary problem is not @entity18 , @entity46 or @entity20			1
it 's primarily @entity227 and @entity228			0
and while the @entity98 has a critical role to play , unless that changes , you might as well hang a closed - for - the - season sign on prospects for a solution .			0

former president @entity2 made comments critical of @entity18 and @entity20 on @entity12 peace
@entity238 : @entity2 is confusing the @entity12 of the late 1970s with today
he says @entity18 is right to let @entity46 take the lead to see if peace can be achieved
@entity238 : @entity29 could n't have *emphasized* peace process given lack of @entity168 support
