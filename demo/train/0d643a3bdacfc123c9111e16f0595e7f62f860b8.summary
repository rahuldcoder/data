the @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 has 85 shiny new submachine guns , locked and loaded			1
they 've long had a small police force , and they 're not alone , thanks to a mostly forgotten provision in the behemoth 2002 @entity9 that allows certain the @entity1 of inspector general to equip themselves with agents who carry guns			1
criminal investigators at agencies like the @entity2 , the @entity16 and @entity17 can carry firearms			1
the @entity2 first gained the permanent ability to arm its criminal investigators in 1981			1
twenty - five other federal agencies gained that permanent ability in 2002 as result of the @entity9			1
at 73 federal agencies and departments , independent sub-agencies called the @entity1 , or @entity26 , conduct oversight , perform audits and enforce laws			2
it is that last function that led the @entity2 to order the .40 - caliber " submachine guns " in may			1
a spokesman for @entity33 told @entity34 that these " semi-automatic " weapons were acquired on september 9 , 2014			2
the @entity37 's @entity1 put out a similar purchase order in 2010 for 27 shotguns			0
surprisingly , @entity40 does not know how many and what type of weapons the agencies have been stockpiling , according to @entity44 rep. @entity44 of @entity45			1
he wants a @entity47 report on the issue and has introduced legislation this year to strip the @entity50 of their guns			2
" @entity0 do n't see why dozens of federal agencies need their own highly armed police forces with the authority to raid homes and businesses , " @entity44 told @entity34			1
so why do investigators at agencies better known for meat inspections and processing crop insurance claims need automatic weapons ? " regarding the need for weapons ' procurements , @entity1 's investigations division conducts hundreds of criminal investigations each year , some of which involve @entity1 agents , @entity2 employees , and / or members of the public facing potentially life threatening situations , " @entity2 deputy counsel @entity58 said			1
while the @entity2 has long had gun carrying agents , many other agencies did not have those law enforcement powers prior to a 2002 law meant to correct for the poor law enforcement coordination prior to september 11			1
one of the changes was section 812 that turned these additional inspector general offices into permanent law enforcement agencies			2
prior to that , some of the @entity88 had to ask for special permission -- citing specific need to carry firearms -- from the @entity0 attorney general			0
these were granted on an ad hoc basis and almost universally , but they had to be renewed			0
the 2002 @entity9 codified these law enforcement powers and the right for agents of the @entity88 to carry firearms			0
the agencies efforts to stock weapons and ammunition caught the eye of curious lawmakers in 2013 when the @entity104 held a subcommittee hearing			1
the hearing revealed that the @entity107 has 290 investigators who carry firearms , but for the past two decades , those agents have only fired their guns twice in the line of duty			1
but agencies are getting some use of their police gear			2
last year , the @entity117 launched a criminal investigation into an @entity120 gold mine for potential violations of the @entity122			0
they sent 10 officers ( five from the @entity117 who carried shotguns ) in bulletproof vests , according to a review of the incident by the state of @entity120			0
no charges have been levied			0
in 2011 , the @entity132 conducted armed raids of an @entity135 farm searching for raw - milk related infractions			2
in justifying the need for @entity107 's audit arm to carry guns , @entity107 's inspector general @entity138 cited a standoff with a murder suspect			2
but @entity138 acknowledged @entity144 accompanied @entity107 's agents in that pursuit			0
rep. @entity44 thinks that law enforcement - specific agencies should take the lead , not regulators			0
" when there are genuinely dangerous situations involving federal law , that 's the job of the @entity156 , not regulatory agencies like the @entity132 or the @entity37 , " @entity44 said			0
@entity158 , president of @entity160 - to - @entity161 , whose members have been raided by the @entity132 , said agents have even pointed their guns at unarmed food producers suspected of permit violations			0
" these people do n't need their own enforcement teams			0
" " they have the @entity170 at their disposal , if there really is a problem , " @entity169 told @entity34			0
@entity2 's inspector general office confirmed to @entity34 that the majority enforcement actions -- arrest and search warrants -- are done in conjunction with another federal , state or other law enforcement agency			1
according to a 2012 report by the @entity156 's statistics arm , there were over 3500 gun - wielding agents assigned to the various offices of inspector general as of 2008 , including 52 at @entity17 , 34 at the @entity16 , six at the @entity187 , and 28 at the @entity188 , the federal government 's hr wing .			0

certain *civilian* agencies employ armed investigators
the @entity2 just bought 85 " submachine guns "
@entity40 does n't know what weapons the agencies have
