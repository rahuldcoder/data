-- after noticing smoke seeping inside , a @entity2 bus driver rushed six elementary school children off her vehicle moments before it burst into flames			1
the incident occurred wednesday afternoon as @entity9 was driving the children home from @entity11 , a public school in @entity12 , school district spokeswoman @entity13 said			1
" we are very proud of her and for her following proper procedures , " said @entity13 , speaking on behalf of @entity14 , on thursday			0
" it could have taken a very different turn had she not done her job correctly			0
" @entity9 told @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity0 's sister network , that she was driving on her route through a @entity12 neighborhood when she detected a " burning smell " and pulled over to investigate			1
" as that was going on , smoke started to come from under the dash of the bus , " she recalled			2
at that point , @entity9 guided the young students on board to the back of the bus			0
describing the children as " calm , " she said that they exited " one - by - one " through the rear emergency exit			0
the bus driver said she and the students , ages 5 to 10 , then " walked so far up the street " where they witnessed the smoke and flames engulf the vehicle			1
video , posted on @entity46 and apparently taken after the students had moved to a safe place , shows black smoke seeping out of open windows on the bus , as it sits along a residential street			2
flames are then clearly visible creeping backwards from the front of the bus			2
within just over a minute , fire had consumed about half the vehicle -- and shot up through the roof			0
there are no injuries related to the incident , @entity13 said			0
while describing @entity9 as modest , the school district spokeswoman said that she deserves praise -- and she 'll get some next week , when she is honored by the @entity63			1
" i do have two kids , and i do love children , ( and ) i love my job , " @entity9 said of the satisfaction she gets working as a bus driver			1
