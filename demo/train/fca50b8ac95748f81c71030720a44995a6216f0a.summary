police gave the following account of what happened , based on an internal investigation : " when lt. @entity107 arrived , he determined that the crowd was so out of control that it was necessary to clear the bar to re-establish order			1

there were failures by some officers and supervisors " to properly file affidavits , supplemental reports , booking reports , use of force reports and arrest warrants			0
" the 13 disciplined officers also will be getting remedial training in documentation and reporting			2
" the investigators also determined that these paperwork failures , all of which occurred after the incident and related arrests , did not cause or contribute to the events in question or lead to any improper conduct by any officer in their responses to the situation presented by @entity38 and the others who were arrested , " according to police			0
