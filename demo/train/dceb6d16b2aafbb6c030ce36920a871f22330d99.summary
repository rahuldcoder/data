-- what 's in a nombre ? apparently , for some @entity5 , er , i mean @entity6 , it matters a lot			1
when researchers asked a group of people with roots in @entity13 what they wanted to be called , they got a variety of responses			1
according to a new survey by the @entity18 , the preferred term for many is " hispanic			2
" people prefer that word over " @entity6 " by a two - to - one margin , 33 % to 14 %			1
but the study also revealed that most @entity5 / @entity6 ( 51 % ) do n't use either term and could n't care less what they 're called			1
also , in a fascinating trend , the survey found that for those who want to affix their own label , the first preference is tied to an individual 's country of origin or that of their parents			1
fifty - one percent of those surveyed said they describe their identity by using country of origin			2
come to find out that we 're not " hispanics " or " latinos " after all			1
we 're @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and a couple dozen other possibilities drawn from this hemisphere			0
the more specific , the better			0
according to the survey , only 24 % of respondents said they use catchall phrases like " @entity6 " or " @entity6			1
" and in a finding that will almost certainly rattle the nativists , even fewer -- only 21 % -- say they typically describe themselves simply as " @entity13			1
" what does all this mean for the fastest - growing ethnic group in the @entity64 ? aside from @entity67 advertising firms , government bureaucrats and the political parties , it shows not many people seem to be all that fond of all - encompassing umbrella terms like " @entity6 " and " @entity6			1
" there is no latino / hispanic voting bloc or even one central experience that these people are all going through in this country			0
the concept of @entity6 / @entity6 unity is probably overrated , as we are reminded whenever there is an outbreak of ethnic infighting			2
of course , there are exceptions to every rule			0
the @entity64 @entity6 / @entity6 population tends to close ranks whenever it feels attacked , harassed or marginalized , as with the immigration debate			1
that issue more directly impacts @entity49 and @entity91 than , say , @entity50 and @entity92			0
and yet , in @entity94 , you see @entity50 and @entity92 - @entity13 lawmakers pushing for comprehensive immigration reform			1
perhaps this is because they understand that much of the ugly rhetoric on the other side is aimed at all @entity5 / @entity6 -- not just @entity49 and @entity91 -- and that we 're all in this together			1
in fact , the same is true for @entity64 in general			0
we may look different , but many of us are living essentially the same lives			0
we need to spend less time trying to label each other , and more time looking for opportunities to empathize with one another and work together for the common good			0
no one asked me , but , when it comes to ethnic labels , here 's my preference : " i do n't care			0
" the 50.5 million @entity5 / @entity6 in this country have many more important issues to deal with			1
this is the dickensian era for @entity13 's largest minority , representing both the best of times and the worst of times			2
when @entity5 / hispanics are n't being pursued by marketing agencies and @entity127 companies hungry for a slice of more than $ 1 trillion in annual buying power , they 're being hounded by nativist mobs , racist politicians and the perpetrators of hate crimes			0
it is all mixed together			0
amid all these challenges , politics and government are n't usually the solutions ; more often , they 're part of the problem			0
those on the left should be concerned that president @entity144 , a @entity145 , has deported more than 1.2 million people , most of whom were @entity6 / @entity6			2
those on the right should worry about mending fences between @entity5 / @entity6 and making the @entity152 more inclusive before it goes the way of bell bottom pants			2
and with all this happening around them , it 's foolish for @entity5 / @entity6 to get passionate about the labels that others slap on them			1
what they are called is a petty concern			0
calling for respect , calling attention to their issues , and calling out injustice wherever they see it : these are more important battles to fight			0
let 's get to it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			2

@entity174 : new survey reveals *attitudes* on @entity6 , @entity6 *designations*
he says most with @entity13 roots prefer to identify with their countries of origin
but he says when they 're harassed as a bloc , they unify ; for example , on immigration
@entity174 : latinos should *put* aside petty labels , *concentrate* on big issues that affect them
