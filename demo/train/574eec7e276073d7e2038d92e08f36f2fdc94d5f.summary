-- @entity2 's nightmare cross-country trip to face trial in @entity4 ended monday five days after it began in @entity5			1
the singer 's " @entity8 " flight landed in the @entity4 area , and he was escorted by @entity11 marshals to a local jail where he will be locked up until his assault trial later this month , according to a @entity15 spokesman			1
he had been chained at his ankles , waist and arms much of the time since marshals took him into custody from the @entity21 last wednesday			0
@entity2 's lawyer failed to convince a judge at a hearing monday that his assault charge in @entity4 should be dropped because of prosecutors ' misconduct			1
judge @entity28 rejected the argument by @entity30 that the @entity11 attorneys abused the grand jury process in preparation for @entity2 's trial			2
the singer and his bodyguard , @entity36 , are charged with hitting a man on a sidewalk just blocks from the @entity39 in october			1
but @entity40 did grant @entity30 ' request to hold separate trials for @entity2 and @entity36			1
the bodyguard 's case will be tried first on april 17 , with @entity2 's trial to follow on april 21 , @entity30 said			1
the would permit @entity36 to testify for @entity2 , he said			1
although the charge is a misdemeanor and is unlikely to carry jail time for @entity2 if he is convicted , the arrest has put him behind bars because of his probation for an attack on ex-girlfriend @entity52 five years ago			0
@entity2 , 24 , did not attend a hearing monday in a @entity4 courtroom because he was still on his way to the nation 's capital through the @entity59 's prison transport system			1
planes , chains and automobiles : @entity2 's miserable trip to trial even if @entity2 is acquitted , he could still have to return to @entity5 the same way he got there -- in custody			2
@entity30 could be expected to ask the @entity5 judge to let @entity2 return to @entity68 on his own in that case			0
it 's the difference between flying five hours in first class or spending five days in chains with federal prisoners as seat mates and marshals as flight attendants			0
he was ordered to jail after he was booted from a court - ordered rehab program last month , complicating his travel arrangements for the assault trial			1
a @entity5 judge refused to release him to travel on his own because his @entity68 probation had been revoked as a result of his arrest in @entity4			0
@entity11 marshals picked @entity2 up in @entity5 on wednesday for the start of the trip to @entity4			1
@entity8 -- the nickname for the federal government 's @entity90 -- involves heavily guarded passenger planes that hopscotch the country , picking up and dropping off prisoners			2
@entity2 's legal troubles began five years ago when he beat @entity52 as the two were in a rented @entity97 on a @entity99 street			2
he pleaded guilty to felony assault in june 2009 , which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community " labor - oriented service			0
" the judge has revoked @entity2 's probation twice in the past year , most recently because of his @entity4 arrest			1
@entity2 voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a @entity4 jail in october , but he was kicked out a few days later for " throwing a rock through his mother 's car window " after a family session at the center , a probation report said			1
@entity2 was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment , the report said			0
@entity2 proceeded " to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother 's car window and it shattered , " according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report			2
his probation was revoked in november , but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90 - day anger management and drug rehab program			1
although he completed that program last month , the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the @entity135 , @entity68 , treatment facility until another hearing april 23			0
@entity2 's probation officer reported at a february hearing that the singer " continues to make great improvement " in dealing with anger , stress and drugs , but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for an assault charge in @entity4 on april 17			1
if he is convicted in that case , the judge would decide at an april 23 hearing whether @entity2 should complete his probation in jail			2
he was sent to jail march 14 after he was kicked out of the second rehab program for rules violations			0
the judge said he was concerned about a " provocative " statement that counselors said @entity2 wrote on a card at the @entity135 rehab center			2
" i am good at using guns and knives , " according to a document read in court			0
the rehab program told @entity2 to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations , the document said			2
@entity2 refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient , according to the document			0
@entity2 had been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in @entity5 three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements , his probation report said			0
at that rate , @entity2 could complete the labor in mid-october and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year			0
with his community labor work now on hold , his probation is expected to extend into 2015			0
@entity0 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
