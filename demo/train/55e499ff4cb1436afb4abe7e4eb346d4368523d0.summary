@entity11 was found guilty on five felony charges for the misappropriation of funds stemming from his years as @entity17 's mayor , by the same jury that also convicted four former city council members on various counts			1
but it was n't a sweeping verdict			0
nearly two months after the trial started in january , the jurors also found @entity11 not guilty on five other charges , as they did with others			1

" you are free to go sir , " @entity36 judge @entity35 said afterward			0
" good luck to you			2
" the split verdicts for @entity11 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 came two and a half years after the @entity46 first reported salaries for them and others were well above the norm -- especially considering that @entity17 , situated about 10 miles southeast of downtown @entity50 , is a relatively small city of 36,000 people			1
their indictments left a cloud over the city , which was mired in a financial mess			2
" this community is left with a burden , a huge burden			0

" prosecutors alleged that the six ex-council members , as well as the two other former city officials , turned the city treasury into " their own piggy bank , which they looted at will			2
" between 2006 and 2010 , they " illegally gamed the system to receive ridiculous salaries for doing no work " and were paid nearly $ 8,000 a month for meetings on four boards that never took place or lasted just a few minutes , prosecutors have alleged			0
those boards were the @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , authorities said			0

@entity11 's lawyer , @entity101 , told reporters after the verdicts wednesday that his client did n't knowingly break the law			1
he just took the salary offered him and did his job			0
" i suspect all of us , if we got a job and they said you 're getting paid $ 90,000 a year for a full - time job , we 'd be pleased and we would n't do analysis of how the employer broke down the salaries , " @entity101 said			2
@entity101 suggested that his client , at least , will fight the convictions thus far			0
" these individuals did n't know that it was illegal , " the lawyer said			0
" ... and i think they have very significant appeal issues , all of them			2

after believing her public officials had bilked her for years , @entity129 said she was happy that -- at least to some extent -- the jurors saw that too			0
and with that , she 's ready to end this chapter in the city 's history and move forward			1
" it 's justice , " the clean government activist told @entity0 affiliate @entity138			1
