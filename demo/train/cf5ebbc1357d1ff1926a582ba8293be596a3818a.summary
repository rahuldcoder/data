-- @entity2 ambassador @entity1 withdrew her name from consideration thursday for secretary of state			1
over the past few months , a slew of articles have criticized @entity9 's personality			1
the @entity10 recently ran a piece titled " @entity1 's @entity12			1
" these articles allege that @entity15 's @entity2 ambassador is " brusque , " " dismissive , " " undiplomatic , " " shrill " and awful to work for			1
i felt compelled to write something because these caricatures of @entity9 bear no resemblance to my former boss			1
i worked for @entity1 in 2009 and 2010 as her special assistant in the @entity23 office of the @entity24 to the @entity2			1
over the past few weeks , i have talked to other junior staffers for @entity9 — current and former — who all share my surprise at the way she has been described			1
junior staffers see a side of their " principal " — @entity23 - speak for boss — that others do not			2
being a special assistant involves a wide swath of activities : couriering papers , sitting in on meetings and delving into some policy issues			0
in this multifaceted role , my colleagues and i saw @entity9 as a boss , as a diplomat and as a person			1
in each arena , @entity9 demonstrated a rare combination of openness , honesty and passion			1

before i could set it down on her desk , she asked , " what do you think of it ? " i had n't read a word and froze			0
i soon found out that this was typical of @entity9			1
she always asks people at all levels what they think ; she 's not concerned with hierarchy or status , just ideas			0
you see this in her strategy meetings , which always involve staff at all levels			0
you also see this when @entity9 tours foreign countries			1
she is just as interested in the stories of people on the streets as the proclamations of ministers — and often more so			0
@entity84 ' extremely upset ' with @entity9 's withdrawal as a diplomat , @entity9 can be extraordinarily charming			1
she can put new acquaintances instantly at ease			0
but she can just as easily snap them to attention			0
@entity9 has little patience for dissembling and her insistence on thorough preparation means that she invariably knows the subject matter as well as — and usually better than — her interlocutor			2
this enables @entity9 to move from charm to hard substance in an instant , getting to the heart of an issue quickly			2
some people have criticized this aspect of @entity9 's personality as " undiplomatic			1
" if diplomacy is the art of talking and doing nothing , then perhaps they 're right			0
but that has never been @entity1			2
@entity9 is in government because she believes in strengthening @entity15 and improving this world			2
@entity9 believes that advancing core principles serves @entity15 interests in the long run			2
you can see this belief guiding her approach to issue after issue , in meeting after meeting			0
read more : @entity9 's letter to the president @entity9 is down to earth , too , which won the loyalty of her slightly younger staffers in particular			2
she has an inexplicably vast collection of go - go music — a @entity23 invention			0
she has mastered social media and new technology , but only after overcoming a healthy dose of skepticism			0
and she has a general demeanor , some combination of athlete and wonk , that conveys cool			0
i do n't mean to minimize the serious policy issues she has handled as @entity2 ambassador , a member of president @entity146 's cabinet and a lifelong public servant			0
one op - ed is not enough space to engage her many accomplishments in government and the various policy disputes that inevitably arise over 20 years in high office			0
opinion : a lucky day for @entity1 all i can say in this short piece — and say with total confidence — is that @entity1 is a wonderful person and an inspiring boss			1
@entity23 is filled with people seeking power for its own sake ; people embroiled in partisan politics ; petty people ; imperious , dismissive people ; people who put themselves before others			0
but that is not @entity1			2
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity1 withdraws her name from consideration for state
articles have *claimed* @entity9 is undiplomatic and difficult to work for
@entity176 says those *descriptions* *clashed* with the reality of working for @entity9
he says @entity9 demonstrated openness , honesty and passion as a boss
