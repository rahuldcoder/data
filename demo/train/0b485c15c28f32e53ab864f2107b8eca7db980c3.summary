-- earlier this week , @entity1 sat down in a small doctor 's office in @entity3 , @entity4			1
a technician swabbed his arm and gave him a quick jab with a needle			2
with that , @entity1 became subject no. 13 in the experiment testing a potential @entity12 vaccine			1
the trial was launched on an emergency basis earlier this month by the @entity15			2
it 's the first to test this kind of @entity12 vaccine in humans			1
" it 's not just for the money , " @entity1 wrote in a @entity20			1
" i 'm very interested in translational research and experiencing it from the guinea pig side is very rewarding			2
but yeah , the money helps			2
this one study will fund most of my grad school application costs , though not in time for application season			2
" the vaccine does n't use live virus and ca n't infect volunteers with @entity12			1
instead it uses specific @entity12 proteins to trigger an immune response			1
they 're delivered through the body on a modified version of an adenovirus , a type of cold virus			2
in the initial phase , 10 healthy volunteers were given a low dose of vaccine			1
they were monitored for side effects and tested to see if their bodies are producing antibodies			1
in the second phase , of which @entity1 is a part , an additional 10 volunteers are being given a higher dose			1
all participants will be followed for nearly a year and tested at regular intervals			2
@entity1 , who has volunteered for several prior research studies at @entity57 , spoke with @entity0 about his experience			1
the following is a condensed version of that conversation : @entity0 : how did you come to join the study ? @entity1 : i actually work at @entity57 ; i 'm a post-doc researcher in a developmental biology lab. most trials i learn about from reading a @entity68 ( email list )			1
i heard about the vaccine study from going to preliminary meetings for a different study			2
@entity0 : when was this ? @entity1 : less than a month ago			1
i had my first appointment on august 26			0
it was just a sit - down , to talk about the trial , go through paperwork and consent forms , explaining what the trial was for			0
then they did an initial run - through of my health history			0
@entity0 : what was next ? @entity1 : the next week i had my second appointment			1
they did a full physical , blood work , health history , breathing checks			0
a lot of poking and prodding			0
my third visit was wednesday			0
they drew blood , then gave me a shot			0
now , my next appointment is sunday			0
@entity0 : what was it like ? you wrote that pulling off the band - aid was the worst of the pain			0
@entity1 : i 'm supposed to keep a daily diary for the first seven days , logging my temperature and any symptoms			1
the next morning , i woke up with a slight fever , 100.5			1
i took some @entity107 and it went away			0
other than that i feel fine			0
in fact , i ran a half - mile in a relay race at lunchtime with some people from work			0
@entity0 : you wrote that for each of these regular visits , you 're paid $ 175			0
how many times have you been a human guinea pig ? @entity1 : this is my second drug trial			1
before that , i did mostly mri studies			0
the first one i did , i was in the mri machine and had three tasks			0
they gave me two buttons and showed pictures			0
if it was spiderman , i 'd hit one button ; if it was the @entity130 , i 'd hit the other			0
so i spent 15 minutes playing @entity132 vs. @entity130			0
@entity0 : did you have any reservation at all , taking part in this @entity12 vaccine trial ? @entity1 : none at all .			1

@entity1 is a healthy volunteer who agreed to test an @entity12 vaccine
after receiving the vaccination he had a slight fever , but it went away
he will be monitored for a year for side effects
