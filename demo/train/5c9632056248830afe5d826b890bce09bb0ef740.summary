-- @entity1 has been a hotbed of controversy since the beginning			1
the first festival , organized by the @entity6 in 1939 as a response to the @entity8 -- then a vehicle for @entity11 propaganda movies -- had to be canceled after it launched on the day @entity12 broke out			1
the festival returned in 1946 and has since been a fertile ground for taboo - breaking films , wannabes disrobing for a shot at fame , public spats between directors and critics and publicity stunts gone wrong			1
the latest rumpus surrounds " @entity24 , " a biopic of @entity26 , the @entity28 - winning @entity27 actress who subsequently became the princess of @entity30			2
the film has been criticized by the @entity30 royal family who said it contains " major historical untruths and a series of purely fictional scenes			2
" the festival would not comment on whether @entity38 and his sisters , @entity40 and @entity41 would attend the gala premiere			1
altercations , scandals and stunts are arguably as much the lifeblood of @entity1 as the films and here , in no particular order , are some of the greatest			1
@entity49 and the topless starlet publicity - hungry starlet @entity51 took her top off during a photo shoot with @entity54 star @entity49 and briefly made global headlines during an infamous incident at the 1954 festival			1
the @entity60 b - movie actress and glamor model turned up on the @entity61 looking for exposure and was quickly crowned " @entity67 " by organizers who set the photo shoot up for her on the beach			2
" the photographers got down on their knees to plead with me to take the top off , " she was quoted as saying in @entity70 newspaper , @entity69			0
she did , removing her flimsy scarf top and cuddling up to @entity49 , in just a grass skirt and covering her breasts with her hands			0
in the ensuing scrum three photographers fell into the @entity80 , a fourth broke his ankle and another suffered a fractured elbow			1
@entity51 left the festival a few days later , after being asked to leave , but remained defiant : " as long as sex is box office and i keep my figure , i 'm out to be the sexiest thing on , oh , two legs			2
" dead pigeon gag gone wrong there are some things you just know are a bad idea , right ? apparently not if you are the upstart cast of a hot @entity96 - flick			0
in 2001 , actors from " @entity98 , " which tells the story of the @entity101 music scene in the late ' 80s , attacked each other with dead pigeons on a private @entity1 beach splattering diners at an exclusive restaurant with fake blood , feathers and worse			1
security guards threatened the actors with mace and they were unceremoniously ejected from the beach along with the film crew and entourage of @entity60 journalists who had been watching gleefully			2
actor @entity115 , who played @entity116 the wild lead singer of @entity101 indie band @entity118 came up with the ill - judged publicity stunt			0
he said it was inspired by an alleged incident from @entity116 's youth shown in the film where he poisoned 3,000 @entity101 pigeons with crack cocaine			0
the actors brought stuffed pigeons as props for the stunt			0
@entity132 , who received a cut to the head in the scuffle , told the @entity136 : " i think @entity116 would have been proud of us			0
we came to @entity1 to be wild and now we are going home			1
" see : movies to watch out for at @entity1 @entity140 on the beach it was may 1968 and revolution was in the air			1
students were marching in the streets and workers were participating in the biggest strike @entity6 has ever seen			0
it was , perhaps , inevitable that some of that fever would infiltrate the rarefied movie theaters of @entity1			1
politics burst into the festival when a group of filmmakers led by @entity140 directors @entity158 and @entity159 demanded it close in solidarity with the strikes			2
" we 're talking solidarity with students and workers and you are talking dolly shots and close - ups , " @entity158 memorably shouted from behind a pair of @entity164			0
" you 're assholes ! " @entity158 and @entity159 stopped the next screening by hanging off the curtain as it was being pulled back and the festival was canceled shortly after , five days before its scheduled end			2
no prizes were handed out			0
over the next few years , counterculture also invaded the content of the festival with films like " @entity180 " and " @entity181 " @entity182 vs @entity183 when cult film director and actor @entity182 turned up to @entity1 in 2003 with " the @entity186 , " an incoherent road movie with a graphic , unsimulated oral sex scene , the critics booed in boredom and disgust and @entity183 called it " the worst film in the history of the festival			1
" a humiliated @entity182 returned to the @entity27 and began a new edit of the film but found the time to embark on a vicious war of words with @entity183 , calling him " a fat pig , " who " had the physique of a slave trader , " topping it off by putting a hex on his colon and saying he hoped he got cancer			0
@entity183 retorted , tartly : " i had a colonoscopy once , and they let me watch it on tv			0
it was more entertaining than " the @entity186			0
" and added , in a twist on late @entity60 prime minister @entity216 's immortal line : " it is true that i am fat , but one day i will be thin , and he will still be the director of ' the @entity186			2
' " amazingly , the spat ended in a truce			0
@entity182 finished his re-edit and showed " the @entity186 " at @entity222 where @entity183 saw it again , this time awarding it three out of a possible four stars			0
@entity225 : ' ok , i 'm a @entity11 ' in 2011 , famously eccentric @entity227 director @entity225 told onlookers at a press conference that he was a @entity11 , that he understood @entity230 and that his next film could be @entity232			1
i think he did some wrong things , yes absolutely , but i can see him sitting in his bunker in the end			0
i think i understand the man , " said @entity225 while @entity239 and @entity240 , stars of his sci - fi drama " @entity238 , " looked on in helpless disbelief			1
" how do i get out of this ? ok , i 'm a @entity11 , " he added shortly after in what could kindly be described as an ill - judged joke			1
@entity8 officials condemned his statements , which he retracted shortly after , but officials still took unusual step of banning him from the festival			2
@entity225 has been a one - man scandal factory since he started showing films at @entity1 in the ' 80s			1
incensed at being passed over for the top prize in 1991 , he called jury president @entity257 a " midget , " while @entity259 musician @entity258 , who won @entity260 for her starring role in his 2000 film " @entity262 " said she would never act again			0
but perhaps his greatest scandal ( apart from the @entity11 joke ) was in 2009 when there were reports that some audience members fainted from shock after watching a scene in his grotesque art - horror " @entity274 " in which @entity240 mutilates her genitals			1
the ecumenical jury at @entity1 called it " misogynistic " and awarded it a special anti-prize			1
2014 @entity278 : the red carpet			0

since its *inception* , @entity1 has attracted *protests* , spats and stunts
@entity0 looks at some of the greatest scandals to have *rocked* the festival
among them : @entity227 director @entity225 says he is a @entity11 and is banned
' *50s* starlet strips on beach and photographer breaks ankle in scrum for photos
