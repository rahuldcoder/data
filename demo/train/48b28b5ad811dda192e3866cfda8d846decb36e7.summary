introducing the @entity2 @entity1 , @entity3 when she was growing up in @entity6 , that 's what @entity7 wanted to be			1
at the time , as the daughter of @entity12 migrants , that dream must have seemed unattainable			2
now , not so much			2
for the last several months , the @entity14 graduate has been winning praise for her acting chops			2
and sunday , she became only the second @entity2 to ever win a @entity17 for best actress , for her role in the television show " @entity20 , " which airs on the @entity22 network			1
the first was @entity24 , who in 2007 took home a @entity17 for her role in the television show " @entity28			1
" among the performers in the audience cheering on @entity7 's win sunday night : @entity1			1
what turns this from a good story into a great one is that @entity7 -- recently dubbed the entertainment industry 's " @entity36 " by @entity38 -- is more than just a talented actress			1
we 've seen those before			2
true , given @entity43 's antiquated predilection toward telling stories in black and white -- to the exclusion of @entity46 , @entity47 and others who do n't fit into that narrow color scheme -- not enough of the talented @entity2 actresses who came before got the recognition they deserved or roles that reflected reality			1
but they were there , on screen and on film			2
many latinos have had @entity7 on their radar for the last several months			1
it 's all because of a series of thoughtful and provocative interviews that she has given about her priorities , world view and career choices			1
read the interviews and you 'll see : what makes @entity7 special is not that she can play a character , but that she has character			1
they do n't teach that sort of thing in acting school			0
you get it from your parents			0
and , in this case , @entity7 obviously got it from hers -- @entity82 and @entity83			1
in july , on a panel during the @entity86 summer press tour in @entity87 , @entity7 discussed why she had turned down a role in @entity90 's " @entity89 " where latinas are cast as -- oh , the suspense -- housekeepers			1
she explained : " i found it limiting for the stories that @entity59 have			0
for the stories that @entity97 have , i feel like there 's a perception that people have about @entity59 in @entity97 specifically -- somebody growing up in @entity6 , @entity102 being my first language , @entity104 being my second -- that we are perceived a very certain way			1
our stories have been told , and they 're not unmoralistic -- you know , being a maid is fantastic			0
you know , i have many family members that have fed many of their families on doing that job , but there are other stories that need to be told			1
and i think that the media is a venue and an avenue to educate and teach our next generation			0
" she turned down a steady paycheck , with no guarantee that something else would come along			0
" i did n't become an artist to be a millionaire , " she told the gathering			0
" i did n't become an actor to wear @entity129			0
i have to give this dress back when we 're done			0
i became an actor to change the way i grew up			0
the way i grew up , i never saw myself on screen			0
i have two older sisters			0
one 's an investment banker			2
the other one is a doctor , and i never saw us being played as investment bankers			0
and i realized how limiting that was for me			0
i would look at the screen and think , ' well , there 's no way i can do it , because i 'm not there			2
' and it 's like as soon as you follow your dreams , you give other people the allowance to follow theirs			2
" when " @entity20 " came along , @entity7 thought the show -- which is loosely adapted from a @entity153 telenovela -- was the " most authentic , genuine representation " of a @entity46 family that she had ever seen on television , she told @entity158			1
it has the alluring spice of cultural references , but not to the point where it overpowers the palate			0
" for once , i was reading a script where they were n't talking about my ethnicity , " she told the @entity158			0
" they were n't putting a @entity12 flag on my shoulder			0
they were n't putting a taco in my hand			0
" in an industry full of people who are known for being shallow , self - centered and afraid to make waves , @entity7 is none of those things			1
she is smart , brave and eager to challenge those in power to confront their prejudices and blind spots			1
oddly enough , these are the kinds of things that are supposed to get you in trouble in @entity43 , where people think of themselves as liberal and do n't much appreciate those who tell them otherwise			1
remember the @entity193 hack story , and how flustered the liberal studio executives , writers , producers and actors became when it was revealed that some of what they say in private is n't very progressive ? but @entity7 is n't in trouble			1
instead , she 's on the fast track to stardom			2
and , best of all , she seems intent on taking her community along for the ride .			0

@entity7 says her show , " @entity20 , " gives an authentic picture of a @entity46 family
she is smart and brave to challenge @entity43 's prejudices and blind spots , says @entity211
