-- an @entity4 school district might appeal a summary judgment that said it violated two students ' first amendment rights by punishing them for posting racy photos to social networking sites , the district 's lawyer said			1
the female students , then both rising sophomores , took a series of photos featuring " phallic - shaped rainbow lollipops " at several sleepovers during summer 2009			1
none of the photos were openly accessible to non-friends or those who did not have a photo - sharing password			1
the pictures got into school officials ' hands after a parent printed them and complained to the district 's superintendent that they had caused " divisiveness " on the plaintiffs ' volleyball team			1
the opinion , which district judge @entity32 issued on august 10 , said the @entity26 in @entity33 , @entity4 , did not have the right to temporarily bar the two students from extracurricular activities , require them to go to counseling and apologize to the district 's all - male coaches board			1
the opinion does not identify the students , as they are both minors			2
regardless they are the butt of several jokes throughout @entity32 's 38 - page explanation of his decision			2
" let 's be honest about it : the speech in this case does n't exactly call to mind high - minded civic discourse about current events , " @entity32 writes			2
@entity52 's code of conduct says activities in or out of school that could " dishonor " the school are punishable , but the opinion questions the policy 's constitutionality			1
@entity60 , general counsel for @entity26 schools , said the district does not see the code as being unconstitutional			2
" there 's a judgment that 's been rendered by the court			0
it 's respected because it 's rendered by a judge , but it does n't mean that the school is going to agree with that and settle the litigation at this point , " @entity60 said			1
" it 's an unsettled area of the law , and i do n't think this is going to be the final say on how social media and the school environment intertwine			0
" a decision on a portion of the school 's defense is still pending , @entity60 said			0
another @entity4 district recently won a case that granted it immunity from paying damages under the 11th amendment , which grants such immunity to states			1
that district is defending the decision in an appellate court			0
@entity60 said the @entity26 district will wait on that case 's outcome , and consequently the decision for its own case , before deciding whether or not to appeal			0
the @entity99 is representing the students			0
@entity101 , legal director of the @entity99 's @entity4 chapter , said just because schools have access to information about students ' behavior outside school does not mean they have the authority to discipline that behavior			1
" what schools have to recognize is there is that line and the type of stuff that my friends and i in high school did -- i 'm in my late 50s now -- the school never knew about , " @entity101 said			0
" now , of course , with social media , the school and school personnel can easily find out			0
but that does n't change the calculus			0
" @entity32 's opinion disagreed with the district 's arguments that the photos should not be considered protected speech			1
the ruling says they do not count as obscene or child pornography because they contain no nudity and had a high probability of being understood as humorous by their intended teenage audience			0
additionally , the court opinion holds the situation up against landmark @entity144 speech - in - school cases , applying them with the added variable of social media			1
one of the major issues in the case was whether the girls ' pictures qualify as a substantial disruption to school operations , which would then not be protected speech			1
@entity32 's opinion said the photo shoots , conducted off school property without portraying any school insignia and not shared with the wider school community , were not such a disruption			0
" a student can not be punished with a ban from extracurricular activities for nondisruptive speech , " the opinion says			0
as schools and courts grapple with determining where a school 's authority ends online , more @entity167 cases like this one will crop up , said @entity173 , a professor at the @entity174 and author of the forthcoming " the @entity176 in @entity177			1
" " traditionally , one could talk about a kind of geographical analogy with speech in schools , " @entity178 said			0
" it was fairly clear what speech took place in school and what speech took place out of school			0
" new tests are starting to emerge to determine whether online speech takes place " in " school , such as determining whether the person who created the speech made it available at school			2
without such distinctions , " the school would become almost a police state that could reach out and discipline students for what they do anywhere , " @entity178 said			2
" if we are going to delegate decision - making authority to school officials , as we have to , since i do n't think we want the courts running the schools , then we have to hold them to a high standard , " she said			2
@entity178 said there are some very clear - cut examples of online behavior that constitute disturbances in school			1
@entity219 , for example , interferes with a student 's education			0
though @entity178 said she agreed with @entity32 's opinion , she said the digs and jokes that pervade the document should not belittle the importance of the students ' decision to pursue the case			0
" these two girls and their families stood up for first amendment rights , " @entity178 said			1
" and while the judge makes a few comments at their expense , the only way we preserve rights is when people are willing to fight for them			2
so whatever misjudgment these girls showed in their so - called bad behavior , for society this is very productive litigation , because it protects the rights of other students , as well			1

teenagers posed with " phallic - shaped rainbow lollipops " and posted the photos online
parent brought print - outs of the photos to the superintendent
@entity52 *suspended* girls from *sports* , sent them to counseling , asked them to apologize
@entity4 district judge found the school had violated the students ' first amendment rights
