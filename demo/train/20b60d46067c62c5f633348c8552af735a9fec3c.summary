-- a nurse 's aide in @entity3 catches @entity4 ; her dog is taken away and put to death			1
a nurse in @entity8 catches @entity4 ; her dog is fed , taken away and put into quarantine			1
the stark difference in treatment illustrates the lack of solid protocol on what to do with @entity4 victims ' pets -- and highlights what little is known about the risk			1
why are we even talking about this ? focusing on the cases of two dogs can seem trivial compared to the 4,000 people in @entity25 who have died from @entity4 this year			1
but @entity0 's @entity26 notes that concern about animals can have a broader impact on human health			0
" we 've seen this in disasters before , people not wanting to leave their homes because they could n't bring their animals to a shelter , " he said			0
" the fear among health care workers and @entity40 officials and others is that if people are afraid that their dogs are going to be killed , they might not come forward if they 're starting to show some symptoms			1
" so , can pets get or spread @entity4 ? " at this time , there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with @entity4 or of being able to spread @entity4 to people or other animals , " the @entity40 says			1
some studies have shown that dogs may experience asymptomatic @entity4 infections , the @entity40 says -- meaning they may have the virus but do n't get sick			1
also , the agency says , human infections have n't been linked to dogs			2
" the risk activities that lead to human infections are direct contact with infected human body fluids , or through bats or consumption of infected wild meat			0
" but it 's not yet clear whether a pet 's body , paws or fur can pick up and spread @entity4 to people or other animals			1
biology professor @entity73 said some animals , like fruit bats , can carry the virus without showing any symptoms and could infect others			2
" the concept that viruses in animals can be transmitted to humans and can have potential harmful consequences , that 's obvious , " said @entity73 who teaches at @entity79			0
" so infected animals that are not showing signs of infection can potentially be capable of transferring virus to humans			0
" do we really need to worry about pets getting @entity4 ? not at all , said dr. @entity91 , chair of preventative medicine at @entity93			2
" it is not a danger			0
we 're not concerned , " @entity91 told @entity0 's @entity96 with @entity97			0
" we know that this virus can circulate in animals , but pets have not been a feature of @entity4 spread , whether in @entity25 and certainly not here in the developed world , " he said			1
" we all thought that the attention in @entity3 to the dog of the person who was ill was ill - advised and was a distraction			2
" so why did the dog in @entity3 have to die ? more than 400,000 people signed an online petition asking @entity3 authorities to spare the life of @entity114 , the dog of nursing aide @entity116			2
@entity117 is in critical condition after helping treat an infected @entity3 missionary			0
but @entity121 health authorities insisted they had to euthanize @entity114 in case the canine had @entity4			0
critics said the dog should have been quarantined , just like @entity117 's husband has been			2
what about the nurse 's dog in @entity8 ? @entity130 , the dog belonging to infected @entity8 nurse @entity132 , is now safe with @entity133 and was taken tuesday to @entity134 , a decommissioned @entity136 air base that 's now owned by the city			1
he 'll be monitored at the former military complex where he 's been given bedding and toys to keep him comfortable			0
" @entity130 is in a safe place , away from hoomes , apartments and other animals , " the @entity141 of @entity142 said .			0

@entity40 : there have been no reports of pets getting sick with @entity4 or spreading it
but some studies have shown dogs can have the virus , but not be sick from it
an *ebola* **patient** 's dog in @entity142 is quarantined after a **patient** 's dog in @entity3 was euthanized
" the *problem* is we have n't really studied the *progress* of @entity4 in dogs , " a professor says
