editor 's note : @entity2 is associate professor of history at @entity4 , and author of the forthcoming " change has come : @entity7 and the @entity8			1
" he blogs at http://americanexception.com / @entity2 says @entity10 's piracy problem was fueled by environmental and political events			1
( @entity13 ) -- the drama of an @entity16 ship captain held hostage by @entity10 pirates led last sunday 's talk shows			1
just hours before @entity22 capt. @entity21 was rescued , the piracy incident was discussed as one of the " tests " of president @entity7 that @entity25 warned about during the campaign			1
others wondered whether wars in @entity29 and @entity30 have stretched our military resources too thin to respond effectively to these kinds of provocations			2
many expressed outrage at the brand of naval gangsterism that by some estimates generated as much as $ 80 million in 2008			0
clearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis			0
but what this situation actually reveals is how little we 've learned in the nearly eight years since @entity46 declared war on terror			0
@entity10 is like @entity30 in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the @entity52 and more or less forgot about it afterward			1
the @entity16 supported the government of @entity55 during the 1980s primarily for the same reason we began funneling aid to the @entity30 rebels : anticommunism			1
@entity55 was a regional counterpoint to the @entity61 regime next door in @entity63 and strategically important enough for his human rights abuses to be tolerated			0
and like @entity30 , @entity10 quickly fell into disarray after the @entity52 ended and the @entity16 cut off support			1
during the early @entity68 era , the @entity16 developed a more narrowly defined set of interests and it was common to hear @entity16 foreign policy circles express disdain for " nation - building " projects			1
but two decades later we continue to deal with the consequences of our abrupt exit from both countries			0
our fleeting humanitarian concern with @entity10 ended with the downing of two @entity83 helicopters in 1993			2
but that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to @entity30 : the forces that attacked @entity16 troops in @entity90 were reportedly linked to @entity91			1
the 9/11 attacks and @entity30 's role in sheltering @entity91 should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place			1
in short , we might well have looked at what was going on in @entity30 after september 11 , 2001 , and seen trouble on the horizon elsewhere			2
the @entity10 situation was further complicated by a series of economic and ecological problems that have struck the region in the past decade			1
in the wake of the government collapse , the @entity10 coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing			1
this is a problem across @entity111 and @entity112 but rampant in @entity10			2
according to one report , some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion			0
as recently as 2006 @entity10 fishermen complained to the @entity119 that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse			2
to add to the burden , the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping			0
in 2005 , @entity119 officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore			0
the situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences			0
no matter what we think of their current methods , it 's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue			2
@entity10 lacks a functioning navy -- or government			2
similarly , we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the @entity10 began to respond in kind			0
these environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the @entity150 has more or less ignored @entity10 pleas			1
our intense and highly selective outrage began when the @entity10 started targeting commercial vehicles			0
faced with this response it 's hard to avoid the conclusion that the @entity158 consumer products , carried by these ships are more valuable than @entity10 lives			2
given the recent history of unstable states like @entity30 and @entity29 , piracy is actually one of the milder problems we could have expected from the region			1
in a worst - case scenario , the region could become an incubator for terrorist cells or a depot for training international jihadists -- if it has n't already			0
resolving this problem will likely involve precisely the kind of nation - building the @entity16 once disdained and are now engaged in with @entity30			1
they amount to the back - end costs of the @entity52			0
these pirates are not romantic heroes and their actions have generated an entirely different set of problems in @entity10 , but they have our attention			2
in light of this incident we should recognize there are two sets of victims here : innocent workers taken hostage by pirates and those people living along the poisoned and depleted @entity10 coast who may well see these pirates as heroes			0
we should also know that part of combating terrorism means addressing the conditions in which it flourishes			0
extortion and kidnapping on the high seas is certainly wrong , but by ignoring the dumping of nuclear waste and the threats to the regional food supply , we effectively created a niche for these pirates			0
and capt. @entity21 ' ordeal is a clear signal that humanitarian concerns are not the soft aspects of foreign policy , but rather the key to protecting our national interests abroad			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity10 piracy being seen as test of @entity7 's foreign policy
he says piracy developed in wake of political and environmental problems
@entity2 : @entity16 cared about @entity10 , like @entity30 , during the @entity52
he says @entity16 lack of interest in the country helped to let piracy develop
