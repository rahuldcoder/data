" foreign intervention , it said , would also ratchet up sectarian tensions within @entity18 and plunge the volatile nation into bloody civil war			1
@entity86 : would a @entity18 look like @entity125 ? the @entity130 , @entity100 said , " appears to be driven less by their self - proclaimed ' lofty goal ' of liberalizing the @entity3 people than by geopolitical considerations			1
" @entity97 and @entity131 snubbed @entity105 nations on the @entity133 @entity132 with their veto of a draft resolution urging @entity13 to end the crackdown and give up power			1
@entity3 expressed extreme disappointment at the global body			2
some told @entity20 that they could not understand how the world could stand by and watch a slaughter			0

the opposition @entity187 also acknowledged the deaths , but said the three were killed by " unknown assailants			0
" @entity177 rebels denied responsibility for the assassination , claiming that @entity180 was an opposition sympathizer			0
" the regime continues with a series of assassinations of leaders and officials who sympathize with the rebels , " said an activist with the opposition coordination committee in @entity177 province , who asked not to be named for security reasons			0
" what the regime is trying to do is frame the rebels as criminals , " the activist said , citing the recent killing of the @entity207 director in @entity177 , dr. @entity208 , as an example of this strategy			0
rebels said they kidnapped the son of a top security official in @entity177 , brigadier general @entity216 , in retribution for @entity180 's murder			0
