deep inside @entity2 's @entity1 a team of conservationists venture into the lush rainforest , weaving their way through the bush 's narrow paths			1
tasked with patrolling the immense park , these eco-guards are on a mission to protect its pristine habitat and the life that resides within			2
ever alert , they push deeper into the woods to prevent any illegal activities that could put @entity18 's fragile ecosystem in danger			0
amongst the park 's wide array of creatures , there 's one species that 's particularly vulnerable			0
" the major threat is elephant poaching for ivory , " says @entity25 , who joined the @entity26 more than 10 years ago			1
" there was a big elephant population here , " he recalls			2
" when i first arrived here in 2002 , i saw 35 elephants at once			2
but progressively , despite the efforts put in place to fight poaching , the elephant population continues to dwindle			1
so we steadily saw their population fall -- [ from ] seeing 35 elephants on one occasion to seeing only four , three , two or one elephant at a time			1
" read this : unmanned plane to spy on rhino poachers over the past decade , conservationists say poachers have shrunk @entity52 's forest elephant population by 62 % , threatening the magnificent mammals with eventual extinction			1
at last count , @entity2 had some of the world 's last significant populations of forest elephants , with about 20,000 of them remaining			1
the main purpose of @entity25 's team is to deter poachers through their presence , as well as arrest any illegal hunters			2
last year the patrols arrested 16 poachers in @entity67 , which is situated in southeast @entity2 , within the @entity69 forest			1
will elephants still roam earth in 20 years ? but even as eco-guards intensify their efforts , poachers are getting hungrier for ivory ; the precious commodity is selling for hundreds , even thousands of dollars per kilogram on the black market			1
the lucrative poaching market has been built on high demand from @entity81 , attracting organized criminals who are increasingly using more sophisticated methods in their illegal activities			1
" these crimes are committed because of the elephant tusks , which are sold to big traders within the community , " says eco-guard @entity85			1
" the traders go and sell the ivory at higher prices in other big towns			0
this explains why it has become a recurrent activity in @entity67			0
" last year , heavily armed poachers from @entity97 arrived on horseback at the @entity98 in northern @entity2			1
they slaughtered more than 300 elephants within a matter of weeks , taking only the tusks			1
in some cases , poachers waited for surviving elephants to return to the scene to mourn their dead before shooting them as well			1
at the end of it all , poachers had eliminated more than half of that park 's elephant population , leaving the park to resemble a battlefield , instead of a tourist destination			1
under - equipped eco-guards are no match for these kinds of well - coordinated attacks			0
" it 's frustrating that we should be doing so much to protect the species in this park , yet those who take the laws into their hands continue to slaughter elephants because of their tusks , " says @entity85			1

@entity18 and its peripheral zone cover more than 650,000 hectares			0
there are currently 40 eco-guards in place but that 's not enough to properly patrol the entire length of the park			0
@entity25 says they need more than twice as many guards , as well as better equipment and weaponry to ensure surveillance across the whole park			0
" we need to have a permanent monitoring station , " he says			0
" and for eco-guards to work , they must have the appropriate equipment , appropriate arms to first ensure their protection , but also to serve as a deterrent			0
" the park 's rangers earn $ 15 each day they patrol			2
tasked with enforcing the law , the park guards often cover the forest on foot , gathering clues to track an evasive enemy			1
" we often walk several kilometers without even getting to a small stream from which we can fetch drinking water , " says @entity175			0
" it 's really difficult because you can come across a wild , harmful animal , and you wo n't be able to escape ; this is a regular phenomenon here , " he adds			0
read this : last of the bush trackers on the trail of a dying art last year , more than 60 rangers died in the line of duty , protecting parks around the world			1
according to the @entity195 , more than half of these deaths were homicides			0
whether clashing with poachers or confronting wildlife , danger seems to always lurk for these guardians of the forest			1
" i can say that our missions are calculated risks , " says @entity175			0
" anytime we enter @entity67 , it 's a big calculated risk , " he adds			0
@entity208 despite the risks and the often limited means , @entity25 says there 's a glimmer of hope			0
though it is harder to come by elephants in the park today , the conservationist still envisions a clearing filled with animals the way it was 10 years ago			2
he says the elephant stands a chance so long as the crackdown on ivory markets continues			2
" the number of elephants in the national park of @entity18 has not reached a critical stage , " says @entity25			2
" i am certain that if significant efforts are put in place the elephants will survive			2
those efforts must be made on different levels , on site level , on an international level and on a national level			0

rangers in @entity2 are working to save forest elephants from the edge of extinction
the conservationists are tasked with protecting wildlife in @entity1
the biggest threat comes from poachers wanting elephant tusks
high demand from @entity81 has created a highly lucrative poaching market
