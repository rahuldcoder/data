-- in @entity2 , telematics is big business			1
if it sounds like a buzzword to advertise the latest purveyor of high - tech must - have gadgets , its etymology is no less firmly rooted : " tele " means remote ; " matics " means information			0
cruising right alongside wireless broadband and @entity17 ( @entity16 ) cell phones , telematics refers more specifically to automobiles receiving remote information from commercial service providers			1
these services could include @entity22 ( gps ) , on - demand entertainment , @entity24 and web access , or weather and traffic conditions			0
all taxis in @entity29 are already equipped with a telematic gps navigation device			0
among the corporate sponsors of telematics research and development are @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , who all have speech - interfaced applications targeting consumer products launching in early 2008			1
among the top academic contenders of this highly competitive field of r&d is one of @entity2 's top three elite institutions of higher education , @entity49			1
within @entity49 , the school of @entity52 's @entity51 ( @entity53 ) , headed by professor @entity54 , specializes in both image and speech processing			2
applications of image processing include such popular consumer features as light balancing and face recognition , now standard on most digital cameras , which can also be associated with voice recognition			0
current research in audio processing includes noise suppression and continuous speech recognition , which can be applied as much to cell phones as to voice - controlled telematic devices in vehicles			1
but while @entity2 may live up to its reputation as being the " world 's most wired country , " professor @entity54 points out that on a global scale , the relatively tiny nation is uncomfortably wedged between @entity77 and @entity78			1
on the one hand , @entity77 overshadows the manufacturing industry as the " world 's fastest - growing economy ; " on the other , @entity78 dominates the collective image of the " world 's most high - tech nation			2
" so , faithful to @entity49 's forward - thinking slogan " global pride , " professor @entity54 keeps his research lab 's projects closely aligned with what he calls the " impact factor			0
" r&d value is measured in industry impact , which depends on market analysis and consumer trends			0
after all , the majority of his students studying and working at the highly reputed university are sponsored by the corporate partners that will apply their research to real - world products			0
in yet another example of @entity2 's converged efforts toward collective success , telematics has united the gadget - makers with the engineering academics , as the industry driven by consumers in cars			2

telematics : cars receiving remote information from service providers
@entity49 researches noise suppression , continuous speech recognition
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 will launch new devices in 2008
@entity2 is uncomfortably wedged between @entity77 and @entity78
