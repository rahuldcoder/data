-- and still i might not quit the world 's largest social network			0
ridiculous scenario aside , i 'm pretty serious			0
despite ongoing privacy concerns and rumblings of a backlash , it would take something drastic to make me leave @entity1 at this point			1
more than just a daily habit , @entity1 has become the place where i get important , often surprising glimpses into the lives of the 1,365 people with whom i 've chosen to connect			1
( that 's not counting friends - of - friends , for @entity1 's tentacles are ever - extended )			1
why @entity1 wo n't start trading at the opening bell i 'm not always in love with @entity1 , of course			1
i get frustrated with the social network like everyone else			0
every six months , @entity1 introduces some huge new design of its site or engages in privacy - eroding practices that send many of its users howling into the status - update box			1
they threaten to shut down their accounts , write furious blog posts and organize ridiculous movements such as @entity41 , which got less than 40,000 people to commit to deleting themselves -- a tiny fraction of the network even back in 2010			0
but , in large part , the people who say they 're leaving @entity1 do n't			1
or they quit and come back			0
me , i 'm staying put			0
at this point , complaining about @entity1 is like grousing about the electric company while watching tv , or saying how lousy politicians are but forgetting to vote			1
it 's become an institution -- one that 's going to be around for a long while -- and all the missteps it 's made in its young , eight - year life have never prompted significant user defection			0
counterpoint : why i quit @entity1 , and am not looking back @entity1 is on track to hit a billion users sometime this year			1
with just a few exceptions , that includes nearly every person i have ever worked with , a big chunk of my extended family , most of my friends going all the way back to elementary school and probably all the kids who were in my nursery at the hospital where i was born			2
there 's critical mass , and then there 's @entity1 , the death star that deflects every effort to blow it up			1
@entity1 has won the social - media wars because it 's where all the people are			1
those who have been waiting for something else to take its place , the way @entity1 siphoned off the population of @entity86 about five years ago , are still waiting			1
@entity86 , even at its peak , never had the mainstream acceptance and durability of @entity1			1
@entity1 's new billionaires i post lots of random thoughts and news links on @entity94 , share photos of my wanderings on @entity97 and still check in on the increasingly hollow @entity98 on a daily basis			1
but everything i post to those services also ends up on @entity1 because it 's the platform that feels the most robust and future - proof			1
infographic : how we use @entity1 since @entity1 introduced its controversial timeline design last year , my important personal milestones ( college graduation , marriage , the births of my daughters , the " @entity112 " finale ) all have neatly filed themselves into the digital record of my life			1
that 's what @entity1 wants , of course			2
but i 've come to stop resisting its voracious appetite for personal information			0
if i did n't share , and my friends and relatives and co-workers did n't share , i 'd be less apt to know who just got engaged , who just celebrated a graduation or who in my online community just died suddenly			0
when my grandmother died earlier this year , it was the place my relatives posted photos of her i 'd never seen before			0
it was where far - flung friends and family members offered their condolences for weeks after the funeral service			0
sure , we 've seen the inevitable backlash as @entity1 has grown to include everyone from your grandmother to that third - grade classmate you never really wanted to hear from again			2
but lately , it feels like the arguments in favor of leaving @entity148 's social network have gotten weaker as people become more resigned to the notion of a permanent @entity1			2
timeline : @entity148 's rise from child prodigy to @entity1 billionaire when @entity1 recently bought photo - sharing app @entity97 for $ 1 billion , @entity97 users vowed to quit , complaining that their precious little network had sold out to a monolithic company			1
( @entity160 , that did n't stop @entity97 from jumping from 30 million users to 50 million in about a month			0
) would - be competitors who have tried to take on @entity1 have largely failed to gain traction			2
path , which has a lovely interface and is more focused on smaller circles of friends , just hit 2 million users a few months ago			0
and @entity170 , the open - source , nonprofit that was supposed to threaten @entity1 's laissez - faire attitude toward privacy , has yet to crack half a million users			2
@entity1 to hold all - night hacking session once @entity1 has shareholders to answer to , things may change			2
but perhaps not as much as you 'd expect			0
at a @entity182 event in 2008 , i saw @entity148 speak about his company to application developers			0
even then , he stressed that the future of @entity1 was not as a website or tool , but as a global communication platform upon which other things would be built			2
it 's been amazing to observe how little he 's veered from that vision during four years of astronomical growth			0
if something is ever going to take the place of @entity1 once the company gets so big and complacent that it loses focus , it will probably be something built on top of @entity1			2
perhaps a mobile app that accesses the social network 's huge population , something @entity1 - adjacent that takes what people like about @entity1 and turns it into something more nimble and attractive than @entity1 itself			1
maybe then i 'll think about pulling up stakes			0
until then , i 'm not leaving .			0

@entity209 : @entity1 is where i get important glimpses into 1,365 " friends "
everything i post to @entity94 or @entity98 also ends up on @entity1 , @entity209 says
if something ever *surpasses* @entity1 , it may be a mobile app , @entity209 says
