i ca n't remember exactly how old i was when my mom went away for a night and left my older sister and me home alone			1
what i remember clearly though is the " talking to " i received when my mom returned and learned from our next - door neighbor that my sister and i had a party , which involved alcohol			0
" i 'm so disappointed in you , " my mother would say over and over again , which were crushing words for a perfectionist straight - a student , who vowed never to let that happen again			0
but the story illustrates two challenges for parents : 1 ) what age is ok to leave your teens home alone overnight ? and 2 ) what if something goes wrong when you do ? parents ca n't really rely on the law for answers , especially since only a few states set a minimum age that a child can be left home alone			1
@entity33 , a mom of two grown children in @entity35 , said she never left her kids alone overnight until they were college age because of something that happened to a former colleague			1
that colleague left her high school son home alone and had the neighbors check up on him			1
" well , lo and behold , kids in the neighborhood found out there was a ' parent - free zone ' and it all ended up in disaster , " said @entity33 , a psychologist , educational consultant and owner of a business providing sign language instruction			2
the night resulted in drunken teens , unruly arguments , even a pregnancy , according to @entity33			0
some parents also considered suing the teen and his family , she added			2
so , to @entity33 , the answer was saying no , until college , to any requests from her children to stay home alone overnight and even then , she said she begged them not to advertise their home as " parent - free			1
" " you may trust your kid , but in this digital age this is a recipe for chaos and trouble , " she said			1
' trust and verify ' @entity71 , a @entity73 - area licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice for more than a decade , agrees			1
she said that even if you have done everything right to prepare your child , " a predatory peer " could well pounce on the opportunity to take advantage of you being away			2
her advice is to " trust and verify , " she said			1
" kids with a solid track record of good , independent decisions should be given latitude and a long leash but not complete freedom , " added @entity71 , author of the recently released " parenting 2.0 : think in the @entity89 , @entity90 in the @entity91			1
" some measure of adult oversight , such as neighbors or a family friend repeatedly checking in , is recommended , she said			2
@entity71 also stressed that every child is different in terms of when he or she can be alone , for how long and under what circumstances			2
@entity100 said the maturity level of each of her kids is one of the main factors in deciding whether they can be left home alone			1
she said her oldest was 17 when he was left home alone while the rest of the family went on vacation in a foreign country			1
" we really did n't worry that something would go wrong ... because he has proven how responsible he is , " said @entity112 , founder of @entity113			0
" unfortunately , i ca n't say the same about our triplets , now 17 , who we have deemed not to be mature enough to be left alone overnight , much less for a week while we travel abroad because they tend to be unintentionally careless			1
" knowing your child can definitely help guide the decision on when it 's ok to leave them alone for the weekend , said @entity124 , a mother of six and a co-founder of @entity126 , which provides labels for children 's products and clothing			0
" if your kid is a strong , independent older teen who does not get swayed by peers , chances are they are going to respect the family home , and it wo n't get destroyed in a house party , " said @entity131 , who also blogs regularly about parenting			1
" if your teenager has friends who are a bit on the cheeky side , and your child seems to be a bit of a follower , i would be reluctant to leave them alone			0
" ' he blew it in spades ' being home alone can be teenagers ' first chance to experience what it feels like to be grown up , but if they make a misstep , it can hurt them for years to come			0
that is what @entity156 , a divorced father of three in @entity157 , said happened to his then - 17 - year - old son			0
@entity156 worked at a lodge and had an apartment below the lodge , and decided , after much discussion , that he could leave his son alone			0
" i found out when i got home that before my plane even left the ground on my departure , he was sneaking his girlfriend through the trees and into the apartment , " @entity156 said			2
" to this day , it 's something that comes up now and then as it was his first big chance to be grown up , and he blew it in spades			0
" @entity71 , the family therapist , said allowing children to stay home alone overnight is a process , not a decision			1
" good habits build a capable child , " she said , so preparing them at younger ages by leaving them alone during short , planned outings or errands can help and watching how they respond to minor emergencies can give you a sense of their ability to handle a challenging situation of their own			2
@entity193 , a mom of three in @entity194 , has yet to leave her daughter , who just turned 17 , alone for a night			0
because she has younger kids also ( a 13 - and 14 - year - old ) , she always felt that it would be too much to expect her daughter to take care of herself and her siblings if she and her husband went away			0
" but with the college acceptances pouring on , reality has struck , " said @entity193 , executive director of the @entity202 at @entity203			0
" we need to leave her on her own in a place she is comfortable to help ease the transition			0
" @entity193 said she 's now looking at a time early in the new year she can leave her daughter alone for a weekend			0
" we figure it 's a good way for her to be on her own in a familiar environment			0
of course , i 'll make sure there is food ! " when do you think it 's ok to leave teens home alone overnight or for a weekend ? share your thoughts with @entity219 on @entity220 or @entity221 on @entity222 .			1
