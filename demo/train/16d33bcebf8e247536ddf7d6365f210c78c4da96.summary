@entity0 -- a 1 - year - old boy whose family fought a @entity5 hospital over whether he should be allowed to die received a tracheotomy at his @entity0 hospital early monday morning			1
officials at the @entity9 where @entity10 -- widely known in the media as " baby @entity10 " -- is being treated , wrote that following a thorough examination by a multi-disciplinary team of specialists and ethicists , a tracheotomy was deemed " medically appropriate " for the child			0
the surgical procedure creates an opening into the airway through an incision in the neck , and a tube allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs			1
according to the hospital , this creates a safe and stable way to use a mechanical ventilator			1
@entity10 , who was born in january 2010 , had been in the care of the @entity32 in @entity5 since october			2
his doctor , in court papers , said there was no hope for recovery and recommended that the infant 's breathing tube be removed and he be allowed to die			2
the hospital would not perform a tracheotomy because they consider it to be an invasive procedure , one not typically recommended for patients who require a long - term breathing machine			0
the child 's parents , @entity48 and @entity49 , refused to comply with court orders and sought instead to have their son transferred to a location where he could get a tracheotomy combined with continued mechanical ventilation and later be transferred home into their care			2
physicians at @entity59 say @entity10 suffers from a rare genetic neurometabolic disorder called @entity61			1
the condition is characterized by the degeneration of the central nervous system and is inherited in most cases			0
in february , a family spokesperson told @entity1 the @entity68 have undergone genetic testing , but no genetic link had been found			0
@entity10 will remain in the intensive care unit for seven to 10 days and then head to @entity72 , a pediatric specialty hospital in @entity0 , before being discharged and transported to his family home in @entity75 , @entity76 .			0

@entity5 doctors had refused , *citing* no hope for recovery
surgical procedure allows use of mechanical ventilator
