concentrations of greenhouse gases in the @entity3 's atmosphere reached record highs in 2011 , according to new data published by the @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
the @entity6 's annual @entity7 , released tuesday , reports that carbon dioxide rose to 390.9 parts per million ( ppm ) , up two ppm on 2010 levels			1
carbon dioxide is the single most important greenhouse gas emitted by humans , says the @entity6 , and the increases recorded last year are in line with average rises seen each year over the last decade			1
combined with average yearly rises of 1.5 ppm during the 1990s , the @entity6 says radiative forcing ( the warming effect on our climate ) by long - lived greenhouse gases has now increased 30 % since 1990			2
" these billions of tons of additional carbon dioxide in our atmosphere will remain there for centuries , causing our planet to warm further and impacting on all aspects of life on @entity3 , " @entity6 secretary general @entity23 said in a statement			1
according to the @entity6 , about 375 billion tons of carbon has been released into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began in 1750 , with around half this amount being absorbed by carbon sinks			1
but natural carbon storage facilities like oceans and forests " will not necessarily continue in the future , " say the @entity6			2
" we 've already seen that the oceans are becoming more acidic as a result of the carbon dioxide uptake , with potential repercussions for the underwater food chain and coral reefs , " @entity23 said in a statement			0
the @entity50 - based @entity49 agency , which uses data from more than 50 countries to compile the report , also detailed rises in other greenhouse gases including methane and nitrous oxide			1
around 60 % of methane released into the atmosphere comes from human activities such as farming , rice agriculture , fossil fuel exploitation , landfill and biomass burning , according to the @entity6			0
in 2011 , concentrations reached a new high of 1813 parts per billion ( ppb ) , 259 % higher than pre-industrial levels			2
watch : @entity71 special ' secrets in the ice ' emissions of nitrous oxide -- 40 % of which are estimated to come from human activity -- reached 324.2 ppb , up one ppb on the 2010 figure and 120 % higher than pre-industrial times			0
@entity77 , from the @entity78 at the @entity80 's @entity79 , said the @entity6 's latest data confirmed the trend in the rate of rise reported in recent decades			0
" what it shows is n't surprising , but it obviously has very important implications for the future well - being of the planet , " @entity77 told @entity71			0
even if emission rises were halted now , the planet would continue to warm because of the time it takes for the climate system to return to equilibrium , he said			0
" we are committed to the warming for a long time , even if we do take strong action against it now , " @entity77 said .			0

@entity49 agency report says 2011 saw new high for levels of greenhouse gases in @entity3 's atmosphere
levels of carbon dioxide now stand at 390.9 parts per million , up 2 ppm on previous year
375 billion tons of carbon dioxide released into atmosphere since 1750 , say @entity6
natural carbon sinks are already showing signs of stress and can not be relied on in future
