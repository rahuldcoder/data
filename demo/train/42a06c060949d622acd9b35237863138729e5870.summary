-- while such situations are rare , the puzzling disappearance of the @entity3 jetliner is not the first time a plane has vanished without a trace			1
here are nine cases of mysterious plane disappearances and disasters			1
some remain unsolved , decades later			1
2014 : @entity12 the @entity14 passenger jet vanished early saturday , about an hour into its flight from the @entity3 capital to @entity17			1
there was no distress call before contact with it was lost over the sea between @entity3 and @entity23			2
search teams from various nations are combing the waters on the @entity27 for traces of it , but so far , nothing has been found			1
the mystery over the fate of the jet and the 239 people aboard has baffled government officials and aviation experts			2
2009 : @entity37 the @entity38 took off from @entity39 to @entity40 on may 31 , 2009			2
a few hours later , as it crossed the @entity42 , it told control center its position			2
that was the last contact with the plane			1
its last known position -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports -- and the ocean 's depth hindered searches			2
it took almost two years before the bulk of the wreckage , the majority of bodies , and the voice and data recorders were recovered			1
in 2012 , @entity62 authorities said ice crystals disrupted the system used to determine the plane 's airspeed , causing the autopilot to disconnect			1
the plane plunged into the ocean			1
2003 : @entity70 eleven years ago , a @entity70 vanished in the @entity72 capital of @entity73			1
the plane took off from the @entity75 on may 25 , 2003 , headed for @entity76			1
it departed with its lights off and a dysfunctional transponder			2
there are conflicting reports on the number of people in the company jet , but flight engineer @entity85 is believed to be one of them			2
some reports say he was alone , while others say three people were aboard			0
the plane has not been heard from since			1
its whereabouts are unknown to this day			0
1999 : @entity94 fifteen years ago , @entity94 made a rapid descent , plunging almost 14,000 feet in 36 seconds			1
the 767 jet , en route to @entity97 from @entity98 , crashed into the @entity42 off the @entity101 coast			1
though its debris was later found , speculation remains on the cause of the october 1999 crash that killed all 217 people aboard			1
theories included a possible suicide by the pilot or co-pilot , complete with tales of a chaotic struggle for controls in the cockpit			0
@entity115 said it was a mechanical failure			0
1996 : @entity117 the @entity40 - bound plane exploded in midair shortly after takeoff from @entity98 , killing all 230 people aboard			1
witnesses said they saw a streak of light and a fireball , leading to suspicions that terrorists struck the plane with a rocket			2
others blamed a meteor or a missile			0
the @entity133 ruled that the explosion was caused by an electrical short circuit , which detonated the fuel tank and caused the @entity137 to break into pieces in the waters off @entity140			0
despite the explanation , conspiracy theories of a government coverup abound			0
1947 : @entity144 sixty - seven years ago , a @entity146 aircraft vanished in the @entity147 after takeoff from @entity149 , headed to @entity150			1
after searches for the plane named @entity144 turned up nothing for more than 50 years , conspiracy theorists jumped into action			1
but theories of aliens , among others , were invalidated in 2000 , when the wreckage of the plane was found buried deep in a glacier			1
the crash on august 2 , 1947 , killed 11 people , the @entity162 reported			0
@entity144 's final @entity166 transmission was the word " @entity168			0
" decades later , the meaning of the word remains a mystery			0
1945 : flight 19 @entity172 bombers @entity173 does not refer to a single plane , but to five @entity172 bombers that disappeared off the @entity177 coast on december 5 , 1945			1
a flight instructor flew one plane , and qualified pilots with 350 to 400 hours of flight time were in the others , according to the @entity183			1
radio transmissions indicated that the instructor got lost when compasses malfunctioned			0
radio contact was lost before the exact problem was determined , and no traces of the planes were ever found			2
adding to the mystery , a search aircraft sent to look for @entity173 also disappeared			2
the patrol plane , which took off later that day , has not been seen or heard from since			2
@entity173 was reported in the area informally known as the @entity195			0
1942 : @entity146 fighter a stray @entity198 fighter crashed in the blistering sands of the @entity115 @entity200 on june 28 , 1942			0
its pilot was never heard from again , and the damaged @entity203 was presumed lost forever			0
but two years ago , an oil company worker discovered it 70 years after the accident			1
surprisingly , it was extraordinarily well - preserved , and most of its fuselage , wings , tail and cockpit instruments were intact			0
back then , experts say , planes flew with basic supplies , so its pilot 's chances of survival were not good			0
1937 : @entity221 the disappearance of @entity221 is possibly the most famous unsolved aircraft mystery			0
the groundbreaking aviator was on her most ambitious flight , vying to become the first woman to fly around the world			0
in 1937 , she attempted the voyage in her twin - engine @entity231			0
with about 7,000 miles left to go , she made a challenging landing at @entity234 in the mid-pacific			0
her radio transmissions became unclear , and the last thing she reported over her radio was , " we are running north and south , " according to her biography			0
after spending $ 4 million and searching 250,000 square miles of ocean , the @entity242 called off its search			0
many theories exist today , but her fate and that of navigator @entity248 remain unknown			2
