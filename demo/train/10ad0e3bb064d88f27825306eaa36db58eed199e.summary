the @entity0 is launching an investigation to determine whether a charity intended to help disabled veterans deserves its tax - exempt status after doling out millions of dollars to a direct - mail company			1
sen. @entity6 , @entity7 , chairman of the committee , announced the investigation into the @entity10 on wednesday			1
he said the committee will seek to determine whether the foundation , the subject of a two - year @entity15 investigation , should keep its status as a 501 ( c ) 3 charity under @entity19 guidelines			1
" our veterans should never be used as pawns in a scheme to exploit the taxpayers , " @entity6 said in a wednesday news release announcing the investigation			0
" the tax exemption for charities exists to promote worthwhile causes like assistance to veterans , not to provide tax loopholes to abuse			0
@entity10 has a responsibility to show it 's genuinely helping veterans and playing by the rules			1
" @entity15 's investigation into the foundation , part of " @entity41 's " " @entity42 " series , played a major role in prompting the committee 's investigation , according to a committee staff member who did not want to be identified			1
@entity15 found that the charity 's tax records and other documents showed that little of the nearly $ 56 million raised by the @entity10 over the past three years has gone to direct aid to veterans			1
the group has paid nearly $ 61 million to @entity53 and its subsidiaries , one of the world 's largest direct - mail providers to charities and nonprofits , and its subsidiaries over the past three years , according to publicly available @entity19 990 tax forms			1
the @entity10 still has a business relationship with @entity53 through 2013 , with @entity53 saying the foundation has acquired nearly 2 million donors through its direct - mail program			1
@entity66 , the nation 's largest charity watchdog group , has given the @entity10 an " f " grade since 2010 because of the miniscule amount the charity actually spent on veterans -- which @entity66 estimates to be 2 %			1
in addition to its questionable finances , the @entity10 has provided massive amounts of unnecessary items to veterans aid groups , including candy , hand sanitizer and dress shoes -- all surplus items that the charity receives at no cost			2
in one instance , @entity83 's , a small veterans shelter in @entity85 , @entity86 , received an unsolicited shipment of goods that included 2,300 emergency blankets that were " heavily used " after last year 's devastating tornado , according to the shelter 's director			0
but the charity also sent @entity83 's more than 11,000 bags of coconut @entity96 's candy and more than 700 pairs of surplus @entity100 dress shoes , which the shelter 's president said he could not use			2
the @entity10 also claimed in its tax filings more than $ 838,000 in fair market value donations to another charity , although the bill of lading obtained by @entity15 showed that the donations -- which included chefs ' coats and aprons -- was valued at about $ 234,000			1
@entity15 attempted to get a comment from the @entity10 for more than a year but received no replies to specific questions , even after submitting several questions in writing			1
when approached by a @entity15 crew at the @entity119 hall in @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity10 president @entity116 rebuffed questions			1
later , after being approached at a public event , vice president @entity123 responded that " not all the funds " raised by the @entity10 go to fundraising			2
' " the cost of fundraising is high , as you know , " she said			0
" and it has been for many veteran service organizations who use this kind of direct paying approach			0
" on wednesday , @entity116 released a statement saying the foundation " will happily answer the questions posed by the @entity0 and provide it with information that others have sadly , chosen to ignore			2
" the @entity10 " has helped tens out thousands of veterans with direct financial aid and supplies that have made a difference in their lives			2
media reports about our activities have been plain wrong and we welcome the opportunity to set the record straight , " @entity116 said in the statement			0
two - thirds of the more than 30 veterans charities rated by @entity66 were given a " @entity156 " or " f " grade based on the amount they spend on fundraising compared with actual donations , according to @entity66 president @entity155			2
a small charity called the @entity163 , also connected to @entity53 , gets an " f " grade as well			0
its officers say they have been trying to cancel a contract with @entity53 since august			0
" it 's as if you 're looking at these ratios through a funhouse mirror , " @entity155 said of the @entity163			0
" it really ought to be reversed			0
it ought to be flipped			0
they ought to be giving 80 or 90 % to helping veterans , not 12 %			0

@entity0 says it will investigate @entity10
inquiry to examine charity 's tax - exempt status
@entity15 investigation found group paid nearly $ 61 million to direct - mail company
