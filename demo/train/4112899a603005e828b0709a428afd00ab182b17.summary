-- for years , all @entity1 knew was that her biological parents had died shortly after her birth			1
an @entity6 - born girl adopted as an infant by a @entity9 academic , @entity4 found herself spending her first years in @entity10 before landing in the @entity9 at the age of seven			1
at times , she remembers , growing up in the northwest @entity14 city of @entity15 as a @entity10 - speaking black girl with a white father was a source of confusion for people around her			1
" when i was walking down the street holding my dad 's hand , people would sometimes check that he was n't sort of taking me , that he was n't kidnapping me , " says pool , who today is a writer and journalist in the @entity9			2
" there were lots of incidents like that which actually are just part of my upbringing , part of my dna almost -- i 'm used to having to explain myself , explain what i 'm doing in the room , explain my relationship , whether it 's with my dad or my brother or my sister , " she adds			0
but a few years later , @entity4 's already unconventional life took an even more astonishing twist			1
almost two decades after she left the @entity6 orphanage where she was adopted , @entity4 received a letter from the east @entity48 country informing her that her father was alive and well , living back home with her brothers and sister			1
the news left the then 19 - year - old pool reeling			2
" it was a complete shock , " she recalls			0
" and it was n't a creeping thing like ' maybe you have a cousin ' or ' maybe you have an aunt ' -- it was like @entity62 ! ' you have a father , ' @entity62 ! ' here are your brothers and here 's your sister , ' " she says			0
" my head went into a spin , i did n't know what to do or how i was supposed to respond to this -- was i supposed to get on a plane and go to @entity6 , was i supposed to go back to all the people who i told my story to and tell them ' actually that story is not right , this story is right ' and the whole sense of the story of me was just pulled from beneath me like a rug			1
" shocked by the revelation , @entity4 initially decided to ignore it and continue her university studies in @entity83			1
but the thought she had a large family living in @entity6 was always with her " as a kind of an itch			1
" so about 10 years later @entity4 felt that she had to get on a plane and travel to her birthplace			1
meeting her father and the rest of her family for the first time face - to - face was " incredibly emotional , " says pool			1
at the same time however , it was completely different to what she had expected			0
" it was almost like an outer - body experience -- i watched myself go in the room , i was quite detached , i was surprised			0
" " the thing that hit me the most was the language and i had n't prepared for that -- i had prepared for this beautiful reunion where everybody looked the same as me and we all kind of connect immediately			0
" and it was n't like that and the main barrier at the time was the language			0
" pool quickly understood that her @entity114 upbringing was marking her as different in her birthplace , in a similar way that her @entity6 background was singling her out in the @entity9			2
" i thought i 'm going to feel at home with everyone and initially that 's how i felt -- i stepped off the plane and thought ' wow , i 'm at home , this is where i belong , ' but i realized very quickly that actually i do stand out from everyone			0
" since then , @entity4 has visited @entity6 three times			1
she describes her relationship with her family there as a " work in progress " and has started learning @entity130 -- the local language -- in order to help her have a " normal family relationship			0
" a talented writer , pool documented her journey to trace her family in a book entitled " my @entity138 's daughter , " a project that took about a year to complete			1
" i wrote the book that i wish had been around when i was tracing myself , " she says			0
" there are a lot of books about adoption but usually it 's from the point of view of the parents , there 's very little from the point of view of the adoptees ... and i think it 's important to get the debate they 're in from their perspective			0
" an emotional memoir , @entity4 says the hardest part was not writing the book but going through the whole experience -- initially , she was afraid of how her fathers would respond to the book but in the end they were both very proud and supportive , she says			2
" both reactions were the best reactions i could possibly hope for , " she says			0
an extract of the book was also published in @entity130 in an @entity6 newspaper			2
" that was amazing to see , " says pool			0
" to see that my family were able to read an extract of my book on their own language -- that was a really proud moment for me , that was incredibly important for me , and they were really amazing about it			0
" today , @entity4 proudly describes herself as @entity9 - @entity6 and says she would love to make the @entity48 country her home one day			1
" i 'm proud to be @entity6 and that 's something that has come with time , with tracing and knowing where i 'm from			2
