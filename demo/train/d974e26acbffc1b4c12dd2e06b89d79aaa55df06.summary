how is director @entity1 's take on @entity2 in " @entity3 " any different from earlier screen versions ? after all , @entity5 created an iconic figure in @entity8 's 1978 classic , while @entity10 made an attempt in @entity13 's " @entity12 " in 2006			1
but as composer @entity14 previously hinted to @entity15 , this @entity2 is a little more spiritual			1
" when we started to examine the @entity2 mythology , in the most classic sense , i really wanted to press upon the film the ' why ' of him , which has been 75 years in the making , " @entity1 told @entity15			1
" the @entity23 - like parallels , i did n't make that stuff up			1
we were n't like , ' hey , let 's add this ! ' that stuff is there , in the mythology			2
that is the tried - and - true @entity2 metaphor			1
so rather than be snarky and say that does n't exist , we thought it would be fun to allow that mythology to be woven through			0
" at 75 , is @entity2 still our hero ? @entity1 starts with the arrival of an infant @entity2 via a miracle birth on his home planet , @entity38			1
all the other @entity40 - babes are genetically engineered , groomed by a process of selection that predetermines their function in society , but @entity2 was made the old - fashioned way , with love			1
@entity48 , @entity2 's father ( @entity48 ) , helps deliver the child , to emphasize how much the father is involved with the process			1
but since @entity38 is dying and can not be saved , @entity48 sends this miracle baby to @entity53 , to save us			0
" he will be like a god to them , " he says at one point			0
named @entity59 , he 's raised by humble @entity61 folks @entity62 and @entity63 ( originally @entity64 and @entity65 in the comics )			2
we tend to think of the adult @entity68 toiling away at @entity69 , but this @entity59 ( @entity70 ) is a manual laborer -- not quite a carpenter , but the parallel is there			0
" this character has a balance between the modern world that we live in , and the archetype that exists in this ancient , other way , " @entity1 said			1
" i wanted to make it real			0
" unlike the @entity2 of previous films , this take means the world is n't aware of his existence for a long time			1
not until he 's 33 is @entity2 called upon to sacrifice himself for a world that may not even believe he exists , and he finally reveals who and what he is			1
@entity70 is not strutting around in a @entity2 suit for a large part of the film -- he 's even got a beard for a while			1
this @entity59 is more humble , more troubled , more conflicted			0
as a child , he was even bullied -- and refused to fight back , knowing he would hurt his schoolmates more than they deserved			0
of course , it makes him seem weaker than he is and gives him a new emotional template			0
@entity97 through the years " he 's reinvented anew , " @entity1 said			1
" he 's more down to earth , even though he 's also this larger - than - life , impossible figure			2
our thesis was , look through @entity2 's eyes			1
that 's where we started , and once you do that , you 're in different territory , and that organically changed stuff along the way for us			2
this exists beyond what i 'm going to do here , and what someone else would do beyond me			0
i really wanted there to be an echo of that throughout the film , and enshrine it for all time			2
" @entity38 is also reinvented , with an opening sequence that lets the audience see more of that world than ever before , including giving @entity128 ( played by @entity129 ) and his followers much more of a reason to track @entity2 down on @entity53			1
" i was really excited to do that stuff , " @entity1 said			2
" i love sci - fi , and i wanted this big story to be at the front of the movie and have it be engrossing enough so that when the pod finally crashes on @entity53 , you go , ' oh , that 's right ! we 're in a @entity2 movie			1
i forgot for a second			0
' you think during the @entity38 sequence , ' oh ! this is the movie , i guess			0
' " @entity1 says he felt beholden to the @entity2 mythology that exists in the comics , but he also felt free to mix up characters and situations ( i.e. , turning @entity151 into @entity152 )			1
" i felt it was natural to do that , " he said			0
" we wanted to take this concept of @entity151 , and not have everything be as exactly aligned as it is			0
not everyone has to assume the exact roles that we expect them to			0
@entity162 's transformation " the preconceived idea you have about who these characters are -- you can play with it a bit and let the world open up because of that			2
and then you do n't know what 's going to happen , because you do n't know what your characters are capable of			0
" talk of a sequel and a " @entity177 " film is already under way , and @entity1 prepared for this film to fit within a larger canvas			1
@entity181 does not appear , but a @entity183 logo can be found on many a building or construction site that gets destroyed during a showdown with @entity128			0
could this be foreshadowing ? " absolutely , " @entity1 said			2
will luthor be upset that his buildings were damaged , or somehow benefit from the business he 'll get from reconstructing @entity189 , setting up a future altercation ? " i like that , " @entity1 said , laughing			2
" i 'm writing that stuff down to use it later			0
" and then there 's the @entity195 logo on a satellite , which signals that @entity197 and @entity189 can co-exist			0
" that was also to thank ( producer ) @entity201 ( @entity200 ) , for being a great partner and a great friend , and just acknowledge that inside the movie , and like the @entity183 thing , say , ' maybe this world is bigger than you think			0

" @entity3 " director @entity1 says his @entity2 is intended to be spiritual
@entity1 says there are @entity23 - like parallels to the *superhero*
he says the film is intended to let the audience see the world through @entity2 's eyes
