anti-chinese protests in @entity1 have turned violent with demonstrators setting on fire a number of factories in a southern @entity1 industrial park			1
properties in the @entity1 - @entity8 ( @entity9 ) @entity10 in @entity11 were targeted tuesday by thousands of protesters demonstrating over @entity14 's deployment of an oil rig into waters that both countries claim as sovereign territory			1
reports suggest the demonstrators targeted factories owned by @entity14 firms , although @entity23 received a report that the arson was indiscriminate , with @entity29 - , @entity27 - and @entity28 - owned properties also torched by the angry mob			2
speaking to @entity23 , the ceo of a foreign - owned factory , who asked not to be named , relayed information from his employees that " 600 " protestors entered the company 's factory building in the park and caused minor damage but did not set it alight			0
he said that neither local police nor the government were responding to the violence , reportedly claiming that there was nothing they can do to control the situation			0
a @entity27 - based employee of @entity49 , whose factory was damaged in the riot , told @entity23 that " all personnel have been evacuated from the factory and we can only learn the situation after the protesters leave the area			0
" the @entity59 @entity58 released a statement wednesday , saying that the government had been informed that " a number of foreign companies have been broken into and set on fire			0

a rally , which drew around a thousand protesters in @entity106 sunday , focused local ire on the @entity14 embassy , while smaller protests in @entity114 and @entity115 echoed the anti-chinese sentiment emanating from the political capital			2
while public protests are rare in @entity1 , where the one - party system is wary of public gatherings , there have been several @entity123 protests in recent years			1
