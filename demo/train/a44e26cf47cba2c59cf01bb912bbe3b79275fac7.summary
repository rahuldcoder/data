-- computer applications can drive cars , fly planes , play chess and even make music			0
but can an app tell a story ? @entity9 - based company @entity8 has set out to prove that computers can tell stories good enough for a fickle human audience			1
it has created a program that takes raw data and turns it into a story , a system that 's worked well enough for the company to earn its own byline on @entity20			1
@entity21 , @entity8 's chief technology officer , said his team started the program by taking baseball box scores and turning them into game summaries			1
" we did college baseball , " @entity21 recalled			0
" and we built out a system that would take box scores and historical information , and we would write a game recap after a game			0
and we really liked it			0
" @entity8 then began branching out into finance and other topics that are driven heavily by data			1
soon , @entity21 says , large companies came looking for help sorting huge amounts of data themselves			1
" i think the place where this technology is absolutely essential is the area that 's loosely referred to as big data , " @entity21 said			1
" so almost every company in the world has decided at one point that in order to do a really good job , they need to meter and monitor everything			1
" @entity8 has n't disclosed how much money is being made or whether a profit is being turned with the app. the firm employs about 30 people			2
at least one other company , based in @entity57 , is working on similar technology			2
meanwhile , @entity21 says narrative science is looking to eventually expand into long form news stories			1
that 's an idea that 's unsettling to some journalism experts			1
@entity63 , head of the @entity64 , says he laughed when he heard about the program			2
" i can remember sitting there doing high school football games on a friday night and using three - paragraph formulas , " @entity63 said			0
" so it made me laugh , thinking they have made a computer that can do that work			0
" @entity63 says that , ultimately , it 's going to be hard for people to share the uniquely human custom of story telling with a machine			0
" i ca n't imagine that a machine is going to tell a story and present it in a way that other human beings are going to accept it , " he said			1
" at least not at this time			0
i do n't see that happening			2
and the fact that we 're even attempting to do it -- we should n't be doing it			2
" other experts are not as concerned			2
@entity88 , who teaches at the @entity89 , says computers do n't have the same capacity for pitch , emotion and story structure			0
" i 'm not alarmed about it as some people are , " @entity88 said			0
" if you 're writing briefs that can be easily replicated by a computer , then you 're not trying hard enough			0
