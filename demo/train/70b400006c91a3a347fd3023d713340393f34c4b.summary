@entity2 @entity0 would n't be @entity0 if he backed down			2
but by amplifying his charge that president @entity6 does n't love @entity7 , former @entity4 mayor @entity3 appears ready to risk sullying the powerful mythology that grew around his leadership when he steadied and steeled the nation in the terrible , confusing time after 9/11			1
since those fleeting days when he was a unifying figure , @entity3 has more often dealt in waspish rhetoric and savage mockery -- especially of a president he says has " failed			1
" " @entity7 's mayor " has gone rogue , lashing out at @entity15 and liberal orthodoxy on the war on terror and saying , for example , during the @entity21 controversy last year that the biggest danger to a black child was not from a white police officer but from another @entity25			2
the latest firestorm over @entity6 's patriotism may complete @entity3 's political journey from the center left of the @entity31 to the conservative jungles where @entity33 and @entity34 roam			1
" @entity0 has devolved into this red meat @entity31 base ideologue who periodically seems to need self identification , " said @entity35 , a political scientist at @entity36 and a @entity4 media commentator			2
" maybe it is @entity0 in his dotage , where he has lost whatever boundaries he once had			2
he sounds like a bitter old man			2
" @entity3 seems to be relishing his moment back in the spotlight			1
but he 's also causing awkward moments for @entity31 candidates limbering up for a crack at the presidency in 2016 -- a fact the @entity53 was quick to exploit on friday			2
" it 's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature , and even admiration , tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly , " said @entity6 's spokesman , @entity54			1
" and the truth is , i do n't take any joy , or vindication , or satisfaction from that			2
i think , really , the only thing that i feel is i feel sorry for @entity3 today			1
" @entity68 chairman @entity67 also joined in , seeking to use @entity3 to frustrate the @entity31 's effort to short circuit controversies which could tarnish the party 's image			1
" now is the time for its leaders to stop this kind of nonsense			0
enough , " she said			0
@entity3 's blast , delivered in a closed door @entity31 dinner , and repeated in a media tour , centers on a claim that @entity6 was not brought up to " love " his country like most @entity7			1
it 's a familiar charge from the conservative fringe , that @entity6 is somehow different and does n't view @entity7 as an exceptional paragon but is obsessed with apologizing for its failings			1
" i do not believe , and i know this is a horrible thing to say , but i do not believe the president loves @entity7 , " @entity3 was quoted as saying by @entity90			1
asked by @entity94 host @entity93 thursday whether he wanted to apologize , @entity3 replied : " not at all			1
i want to repeat it			0
" " i do n't feel this love of @entity7 , " @entity3 said			1
" i believe his initial approach is to criticize the @entity7			0
" @entity3 dug in further in an interview with the @entity100 , rejecting the idea that his remarks were born of racism			1
" i thought that was a joke , since ( @entity6 ) was brought up by a white mother , a white grandfather , went to white schools , " said @entity3			1
" this is n't racism			0
this is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism , " said @entity3			1
far from being chastened , @entity3 , who wore a conspiratorial grin on @entity94 , seems gleeful in the firestorm			1
his behavior might be explained by a boxing maxim he was taught as a boy , which may also shed light on his calmness on 9/11			2
" my father taught me ... when you get hit in the face for the first time , you 're going to panic , " @entity3 said in an interview with @entity122 in 2011			1
" instead of panicking , just accept it			0
and any time anybody hits you , they always leave themselves open to be hit			0
" @entity3 's actions may be both a glimpse at his political philosophy and reflect a decision to wade into the political echo chamber to solidify his standing among a certain group of conservatives			1
" he understands political posturing , he understands the effectiveness of rhetoric , " said @entity141 , a @entity1 political commentator from @entity4			0
" he clearly wants to play a role on the national stage			0
i guess he has chosen the role of bulldog -- go after the president , attack him , make wild accusations			0
" with a failed presidential campaign behind him , and having been out of office for a decade - and - a - half , it may be that @entity3 sees his future on the conservative talk circuit			1
" to the extent that @entity3 will be involved in the game moving forward , it will be as a commentator or an analyst , " said @entity157 , a campaigns expert at @entity158 , @entity4			1
" in order to do that successfully these days , it helps to be controversial , sometimes inflammatory			0
i am not surprised that he has become increasingly forceful in his comments in the media			2
he is convinced that will help him			0
" @entity3 has rarely been known to back down			1
he was a @entity171 fan growing up in @entity172 , a ruthless prosecutor who took on unions and the mob and a hard driving @entity31 who ran a liberal city			0
when he awoke on september 11 , 2001 , @entity3 was a polarizing figure with a large ego and a sharp tongue			1
he might have purged @entity4 street crime but was starting to grate on the city 's nerves at the end of his second term			0
within hours , with a staggering display of calm , purpose and leadership , he had recast himself as a modern - era @entity189 , steadying and inspiring his people in their darkest hour			0
his heroics were such that he became one of those politicians who become known by a single name			0
marching up @entity197 , he grabbed a mike and told people to evacuate southern @entity200			0
he conjured up national resolve and resistance , as a country waited hours to see its president , out of sight on @entity206			0
" people tonight should say a prayer , for the people that we have lost , and be grateful that we are all here , " he said in a late night press conference 12 hours after the @entity208 came crashing down in a toxic cloud of fire and ash			0
" tomorrow @entity4 is going to be here and we are going to rebuild and we are going to be stronger from before			0
" making @entity3 its @entity220 , @entity219 said : " when the day of infamy came , @entity3 seized it as if he had been waiting for it all his life			1
" but he struggled to meet huge expectations			0
his 2008 presidential campaign was a bust , plagued by poor organization and his liberal views on social issues that conflicted with the conservative base			0
but there was also a sense that he was playing the september 11 card too much : @entity236 's crack that there were " only three things he mentions in a sentence , a noun a verb and 9/11 " was funny because it bore more than a ring of truth			2
that was years ago now			0
but while his years of elective office are behind him , @entity3 still seems to pine for the political spotlight			2
so he has every incentive to keep this row going as long as he can .			0
