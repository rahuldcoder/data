@entity0 , @entity1 -- is @entity3 auditioning for vice president -- or secretary of state ? the @entity7 senator -- a @entity8 rock star who has been entrusted with the herculean task of pulling the @entity8 out of the hole that it has dug with @entity13 voters because of harsh rhetoric on immigration -- delivered a substantive speech on @entity18 foreign policy wednesday at the @entity19			1
it was an ambitious subject choice			0
at the moment , @entity3 could read the @entity23 phone book and he 'd get his share of media attention			2
a speech like this suggests he 's trying to prove something -- or perhaps prove himself worthy of all the attention he is already receiving			0
as for the speech itself , @entity3 's message was right on target			1
he stressed the idea that the @entity18 remains what former secretary of state @entity35 called the world 's indispensable nation			2
" on the most difficult transnational challenges of our time , " @entity3 asked , " who will lead if we do not ? the answer , at least today , is that no other nation or organization is willing or able to do so			2
" you would think that , for some folks in my profession , @entity3 is the indispensable politician			0
what would we do without him ? any story involving him is bound to get a lot of attention			0
as speculation builds that presumptive @entity8 nominee @entity57 has his eye on the charismatic 40 - year - old @entity59 as a possible running mate , political observers want to learn everything they can about him			1
some of what we 're learning could be embarrassing to @entity3 , like the tidbit that surfaced this week about his maternal grandfather			2
the story appears in a forthcoming and unauthorized biography of the senator by @entity68 of the @entity69			0
@entity3 was born to @entity59 exiles in @entity23 in 1971 , and so he 's automatically a @entity18 citizen			1
but , according to excerpts from the book , which is due out in june , his grandfather , @entity75 @entity74 , entered the @entity18 without a visa in 1962 and spent the next few years in legal limbo while pleading for leniency from @entity18 immigration officials			1
finally , @entity74 was ordered to leave the @entity18			0
normally , this kind of family history would hardly be worth mentioning			1
and , while i expect that some right - wing talk show hosts will suggest that the reason the media is mentioning it now is to try to sour conservatives on @entity3 , that 's really not what 's going on here			1
conservatives are n't likely to hold @entity3 accountable for the actions of his grandfather			2
this story is important because it drives a wedge between @entity3 and the voters he is supposed to be able to deliver to the @entity8			1
when you 're a @entity59 - @entity18 politician who is being put forth by your party to help get votes from @entity13 voters -- the majority of whom are @entity103 or @entity103 -- things can get complicated			1
when it comes to immigrating to the @entity18 , @entity105 get preferred status			1
thanks to the @entity108 , which was enacted in 1966 -- or four years after @entity3 's grandfather came to the @entity18 -- @entity59 refugees who flee the @entity111 and reach the @entity18 shoreline have a clear path to legal residency and eventual citizenship			1
@entity103 immigrants are n't so fortunate			0
so when @entity59 - @entity18 do what @entity3 has done since arriving in the @entity119 16 months ago and take a hardline against illegal immigration , @entity117 and @entity103 - @entity18 have been known to cringe			1
after all , that 's easy for them to say			0
last year , @entity3 came under criticism from fellow @entity125 for getting wrong the year that his parents came to @entity18			1
it turned out that they left @entity105 before @entity129 took power , making them immigrants and not refugees			0
so here we have one more thing that @entity117 and @entity103 - @entity18 can use against @entity3 to try to take him down a peg or two			1
they 'll gladly remind him that he 's no better than they are , and that while some of their ancestors may have come to this country illegally , so did at least one of his			0
as bad as this relationship has been , it 's about to get worse because of " grandpa-gate			0
" stories like this make @entity3 damaged goods and less useful in luring @entity125 to the @entity8 ticket			1
that being the case , his vice presidential stock has to be plummeting			0
what good does it do the ticket for @entity3 to be popular with whites and @entity59 ? @entity8 are likely to get the majority of those votes anyway			2
his value is all wrapped up in how well he plays with @entity117 and @entity103			0
and right now , the answer is " not well			0
" @entity3 on the @entity8 ticket ? i would n't bet on it			2
say , maybe secretary of state would be a good consolation prize after all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity3 is considered a rising star among @entity8
@entity168 says @entity3 's family history may clash with his hardline immigration view
new report says @entity3 's grandfather entered @entity18 illegally from @entity105
@entity168 says @entity3 may not help boost @entity57 's support among @entity103 - @entity18
