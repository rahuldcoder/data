this week the @entity11 expanded the investigation to include @entity16 from model years 1993 to 2001 and @entity19 models from 2002 to 2007			0
federal investigators initially looked into the @entity9 following complaints by the @entity22 , a consumer watchdog organization founded by @entity23			0
the fuel tank of the 1993 - 2004 @entity9 is made of plastic and extends below the rear bumper " so there is nothing to protect the tank from direct hit " in a rollover or rear - end collision , the watchdog group said in a letter sent to @entity11			1
" @entity13 has concluded that 1993 - 2004 @entity9 vehicles are neither defective nor do their fuel systems pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety in rear impact collisions , " said a @entity13 statement obtained by @entity0			1
@entity13 spokesman @entity41 told @entity0 the company estimates two million of the affected vehicles are still on the road			2
" we still feel confident these vehicles are safe			0
they have really , really good safety records , " @entity41 said , adding , " we feel really confident , and we 'll work cooperatively with @entity11			0
" the investigation could take a year to complete , possibly longer if it becomes complex , the @entity11 said			0
in 2005 and later models , @entity13 moved the gas tank of the @entity9 from behind the rear - axle to the middle of the vehicle			1
@entity41 said that @entity13 made the move to allow more cargo space , not due to safety concerns			2
since the change , there has been only one fatal fire crash in the redesigned vehicle , according to the @entity22 .			0

fiery fuel - tank crashes have resulted in 48 deaths since 1993
