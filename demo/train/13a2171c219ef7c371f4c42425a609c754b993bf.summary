@entity1 magazine has revised its apology to readers about an article on an alleged gang rape at the @entity6			1
the apology was originally posted friday on the magazine website and said of @entity9 , the woman who described the alleged rape , " our trust in her was misplaced			1
" in the updated apology , those words have been removed			2
the magazine said of its reporting errors , " these mistakes are on @entity1 , not on @entity9			1
" the apology was changed saturday without any explanation by the magazine			2
@entity1 was criticized by some people for " victim - blaming " in the first version of the apology			1
@entity25 , a writer for @entity26 , said on @entity28 's " @entity30 " show on @entity29 : " it essentially said this is @entity9 's fault but , you know , @entity9 is not a journalist			2
she does n't know the rules of journalism			0
she 's just telling her own story			0
it 's on us to know that you have to trust but verify			0
you have to check the sources			0
you have to figure out with the story is true because if not you end up in a mess like the one we 're in now			0
" magazine managing editor @entity45 sent out a tweet friday afternoon that reflected that sentiment , saying " that failure is on us -- not on her			2
" but those thoughts were not put into the apology until saturday			2
the november 19 article , titled " a rape on campus : a @entity60 and @entity61 at @entity6 , " chronicled the school 's failure to respond to that alleged assault in a fraternity house			0
one of the major criticisms of @entity1 is that the reporter did not seek comment from the men @entity9 says raped her			1
the updated apology says @entity1 honored a request from @entity9 , a pseudonym , not to interview the men because she feared retaliation			1
" we should have not made this agreement with @entity9 , and we should have worked harder to convince her that the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story , " said the updated apology written by @entity45			1
" these mistakes are on @entity1 , not on @entity9			1
" the updated apology mentions discrepancies in @entity9 's account that have already been reported by the @entity80 and other news outlets			1
for instance , @entity83 did not have a party the night in september 2012 @entity9 said the rape occurred and the man she identified as her date that night was not a member of that fraternity , the apology says			1
the apology says , " a friend of @entity9 's ( who we were told would not speak to @entity1 ) told the @entity80 that he found @entity9 that night a mile from the school 's fraternities			1
she did not appear to be ' physically injured at the time ' but was shaken			0
" she told him that that she had been forced to have oral sex with a group of men at a fraternity party , but he does not remember her identifying a specific house			0
other friends of @entity9 's told the @entity80 that they now have doubts about her narrative , but @entity9 told the @entity80 that she firmly stands by the account she gave to [ reporter @entity106			2
" after the article ran in november , it prompted an emergency meeting by the school 's governing board and the announcement of a zero - tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases			0
the school suspended fraternity social events until the spring semester			0
according to the magazine , @entity9 , who at the time had just started her freshman year at the @entity121 school , claimed she was raped by seven men at @entity83 fraternity , while two more gave encouragement , during a party			1
however , the @entity6 's @entity83 chapter did not have a party the night of september 28 , 2012 , the date when the alleged attack occurred , or at all that weekend , the chapter said in a statement friday			0
the chapter 's lawyer , @entity133 , told @entity29 email and fraternity records are proof .			0
