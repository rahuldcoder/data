-- @entity2 listed companies have reported a sharp rise in unpaid bills during the third quarter , in one of the clearest signs yet of the toll that @entity2 's economic slowdown is taking on corporate balance sheets			1
a @entity0 analysis revealed that 66 per cent of listed @entity2 companies that have reported third - quarter results showed a year - on - year increase in such unpaid bills -- called accounts receivable in accounting -- as a proportion of sales , according to the @entity20 database			1
@entity2 's economy is on track to grow at less than 8 per cent this year , which would be its slowest in more than a decade			1
while that is still very fast by international standards , many companies have invested on the expectation of sustained double - digit growth and the sharp rise in accounts receivable is an indication of how even a mild slowdown has caught them off guard			1
the hardest hit companies are those linked to the construction and infrastructure sectors , including machinery makers , steel mills , coal and cement companies			0
@entity42 , the world 's ninth - largest machinery maker by sales , reported that accounts receivables were up 83 per cent year to date at the end of the third quarter , hitting rmb21bn			2
" due to the impact of the macroeconomic environment , sales repayments have seen some deferrals , " the company said			0
other machinery companies reported similar problems : at @entity55 - listed @entity54 , accounts receivable rose 169 per cent from the beginning of the year			1
at @entity58 , a leading @entity2 machinery maker , accounts receivable at the end of the third quarter were up 69 per cent from the beginning of the year , according to earnings released on tuesday			2
@entity63 , economist at @entity64 said accounts receivable growth picked up in august and september			0
" some enterprises are reluctant to reduce production , so they continue to produce and sell things even when the buyers ca n't pay the money , " ms @entity63 said			0
" this is a big difference from 2008 , when collapsing demand caused many enterprises to reduce production very significantly			0
" @entity2 's metals producers and coal miners have been particularly slow to cut production despite lacklustre demand for their products			1
at @entity82 and @entity83 , the biggest listed producers of steel and copper , unpaid bills rose 52 per cent and 66 per cent , respectively , since the beginning of the year			1
however , some optimists expect that the problem of unpaid bills could improve by the end of this year , as @entity91 's small steps to encourage economic growth start to take effect			1
" this might be a lagging indicator that will dissipate in coming quarters , " said @entity94 , an economist at @entity95			0
" the financial situation has eased recently , " he added , citing recently approved new infrastructure projects			0
furthermore , for all the pain being felt by @entity2 corporations , the country 's banks are showing few outward signs of any credit trouble			2
at the end of the first half , the overall bad debt ratio for the banking sector was just 0.9 per cent , near an all - time low since the country 's banks were recapitalised a decade ago			0
of the big banks that have reported their third - quarter results , credit quality has actually improved			2
in quarter - on - quarter terms , non-performing loan ratios fell 0.5 basis points at @entity119 , 2bp at @entity120 and 1.5bp at @entity120			0
there has been a slight increase in overdue loans at most banks , however , and many analysts and investors believe that banks might be disguising a more serious deterioration in asset quality by moving bad loans off their balance sheets or simply rolling them over			1
