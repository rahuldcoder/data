@entity1 , @entity0 -- there are few things in the world shrouded with as much secrecy as the super-yacht industry			1
maritime mysteries : the design and building processes for super-yachts are tightly guarded secrets			1
the boats are built and kept in exclusive locations , they 're owned by the notoriously inaccessible super-wealthy , and for most of us the closest we 'll get to them is in the pages of glossy magazines			2
in a bid to gain a stronger insight into the super-yacht world i 've organised an interview with dr @entity26 , the owner of @entity28 's @entity27 - the oldest yacht design company in the world			1
the company formed in 1873 and in its time has produced four @entity34 yachts and more presidential and royal yachts than any other yacht designer			1
it seems the logical business to profile			2
but , there 's a catch			2
in this industry ' loose lips ' really do ' sink ships ' ... or at least destroy business , anyway			2
@entity26 ca n't tell me anything about the projects the company is working on , the people he 's working for , or how much these ocean - going beasts cost to produce			1
" we enter into very strict confidentiality agreements with our clients			1
we find it frustrating at times because we would like to approach people about doing a project because we have done a similar project - but we ca n't mention it			1
" these guys can get into the press whenever they want			0
unfortunately in the @entity61 due to the nature of the press they have nothing to gain from having their personal property displayed for all to see , " @entity26 told @entity2			0
and when most of @entity70 's business comes from client referrals , the company is wise not to jeopardize confidentiality agreements			1
@entity26 confirmed the company would have less than 100 clients on its books and it tries to manage several projects on differing scales at the one time			1
he said a usual workload was to have one 200 - feet plus project , one around 100 - 150 feet and a few smaller projects on the go simultaneously			1
the ' smaller ' vessels @entity26 refers to are often in the range of 60 - 80 feet long			2
though @entity26 declines to comment on the net worth of his clients , i infer from the discussion that most of them are multi-millionaires , if not billionaires			0
this is certainly not a place for someone with shallow pockets			0
he said the current ' credit crunch ' hitting many consumers was unlikely to have too much impact on his business			0
" they would be generally insulated from that			0
budget is always an issue for people but that is more because people do n't like change			0
a lot of what we do is to protect the client 's interests - to make sure they do n't pay too much , " he said			2
@entity26 said the company had two major strands : design and owner representation			1
while the first aspect is self - explanatory , the second involves the full management of entire building or restoration projects from the owner 's point of view			1
the full process of building or restoring a boat usually took between three to five years and became quite an intimate affair , he said			2
" we have a very close relationship with the clients			0
inevitably because we are designing someone 's ideal home we are finding out a lot about them and what they like and do n't like			0
you get to know them very well			0
" however , it 's not all fairytales			0
the privileged position his job places him in also has its downfalls			0
" anyone who says these things go smoothly is lying , " he laughed			0
@entity26 said although he had not experienced any disappointed clients , he had heard of cases where multi-million dollar vessels had not been to the satisfaction of the buyer			0
after buying the company in 2001 at a time when he had been personally working towards restoring a @entity27 original , @entity26 -- a passionate sailor himself , said the market was changing			2
the company worked on both sailing and motor - powered yachts , and he said it was going back to the future in some respects			1
" the company originally came very much out of a racing sailing design			1
from the 1880s it became more involved in cruise yacht design			1
what we are doing now is getting back into that big yacht market			2
" he said there was a trend towards creating replicas or restorations with as many of the original materials as possible			0
" people for many years have been restoring sailing yachts and in many instances they tend not to use original materials			1
but , people are becoming more educated in this market			0
" now , if people are going to do something in this market they want to do something special , something worthwhile , " he said			0
one of the projects which @entity26 does detail is the @entity188 , a 296 - foot 1930s @entity70 original , which is set for restoration			1
after being returned to @entity61 waters only in 1999 , @entity26 said the vessel would have a complete overhaul based on the company 's archives of the original design , and it would become the " biggest restoration project ever "			1
@entity26 said the company also planned to expand the range of services it provides to clients			2
although there 's plenty to look forward to at @entity27 and business is flourishing -- @entity26 drops in a strong reminder that the job of pleasing wealthy clients does not open the door to excessive levels of wealth for himself			0
" we are not yacht owners - we do n't own these			1
we are here to produce them for orders			0
" in fact , for one of the most glamorous industries in the world , @entity26 said there was plenty of hard graft done behind - the - scenes , and for him , a lot of travel to and from his @entity28 base			1
" we do n't always need to be in the @entity227 ! the lifestyle is n't always attractive			0

@entity230 is the oldest yacht design company in the world
the company is bound to tight confidentiality agreements about its projects
the restoration of 1930s vessel ' @entity188 ' will be the biggest of its kind
most yachts take three - to - five years to complete
