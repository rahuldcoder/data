-- human rights activists decried tuesday a @entity4 judge 's decision not to try former dictator @entity5 for human rights violations			1
the @entity8 @entity7 said @entity5 must be prosecuted for alleged crimes that include torture , rape and extrajudicial killings			2
" the high commissioner has consistently reminded @entity4 of its absolute obligation to investigate these well - documented serious human rights violations and to prosecute those responsible for them , " spokesman @entity13 said			1
@entity18 echoed those concerns in what it called the most important criminal case in @entity4 history			0
" this ruling is another reminder that @entity4 's justice system has almost always been on the side of the powerful , no matter how gruesome or destructive their crimes , " said @entity27 , special counsel for the organization			0
" we hope that it will be overturned on appeal			0
" @entity4 , said @entity27 , " has an obligation to its people to investigate and prosecute the grave violations of human rights under @entity5 's rule			1
" the investigative magistrate overseeing the case , carves @entity5 , ruled that @entity5 will face trial on corruption charges stemming from his 15 years in rule but not for human rights abuses , the @entity39 reported			1
@entity5 said the statute of limitations had run out on those alleged crimes			2
@entity5 , who called himself " president for life , " fled @entity4 in 1985			2
he stunned the world by returning from 25 years of exile in @entity53 to his homeland a year ago			0
within days of his return to @entity56 , he was charged with human rights crimes as well as financial wrongdoing : he allegedly embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars on which he lived in exile			2
as such , the statute of limitations has not run out on those allegations			0
@entity18 and @entity63 have documented what they call systematic violations under @entity5 's rule			0
both organizations accuse @entity5 of imprisoning and torturing hundreds of @entity4 , including journalists , and using violent means to silence voices of opposition			2
@entity63 gave the public prosecutor in the @entity5 case 100 documents that it said detailed cases of human rights violations			1
" the cases of human rights abuses we documented in @entity4 are likely to be only a small proportion of what really happened during @entity5 's rule , " @entity78 , a special adviser at @entity63 , said last year			1
" we will probably never know the true extent of the horror , but carrying out effective investigations will go a long way towards delivering justice			0
" @entity63 's documents told the experiences of cobblers , taxi drivers , filmmakers , mechanics , distillers and even hairdressers , all of whom , they say , were arrested for anti-government activity			0
@entity18 said the statute of limitations ruling contravenes the decisions of the @entity104 , by whose judgments @entity4 is legally bound			0
the @entity8 human rights office , which had offered technical assistance to @entity4 authorities to bring the case to trial , said it was deeply disappointed			1
" it is clear under international law that there is no statute of limitations for such crimes , and the @entity8 human rights office has provided technical assistance and legal advice stressing this point , " @entity13 said			1
" we urge the relevant authorities to ensure that justice is , belatedly , delivered to the many victims of human rights abuses committed under the government of mr. @entity5			1
there can be no true reconciliation and forgiveness without justice			0
