-- @entity2 movies and high - fashion runways may seem a world away from a discussion about feeding the hungry , but @entity7 - winning actress @entity6 is joining designer @entity8 in his work with the @entity10 to fight hunger			1
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity14 , the pregnant actress said that being a mother inspired her to act on behalf of hungry children because hunger often starts in the womb			1
" especially now , being a pregnant woman and already having a child ... it 's so important what happens to the baby while they 're in utero			2
and the first 1,000 days is fundamental , " said @entity26 , who 's showing only a small baby bump			0
the @entity10 is considered the @entity10 ' front - line agency in the fight against hunger			1
it brings food to more than 90 million people in more than 75 countries			1
late last year , @entity8 partnered with the @entity10 to raise awareness and funds , and now he 's bringing @entity26 on board			1
the actress has worked with the @entity39 in @entity40 , which provides shelter and assistance to women and children suffering from domestic violence			1
the @entity10 " has been a natural segue for me , " she said , " because i care so much about women and children			1
" @entity6 on pregnancy : ' biggest surprise of my life ' " i 'm a mom , and that 's first and foremost , but it gives me another reason to exist , another purpose			1
and if i know that i 'm helping one person every day in some way , that really makes me feel good , and that 's a legacy that i can leave to my children , " @entity26 said			0
for @entity62 , fighting hunger has long been a passion			0
he has worked with @entity65 's love we deliver in the @entity67 for more than 20 years to provide free , healthy food for men , women and children living with hiv / aids , cancer and other serious illnesses			1
" i 'm a guy who likes to see results			0
and ... this is a solvable problem			0
you can change someone 's life immediately and with the @entity10			2
we 're talking about doing what i 've been doing in my backyard , but globally , " @entity8 said			2
the @entity10 " can go anywhere , which is so spectacular , " he said			2
" you need to be able to shift on a dime , because there could be a hunger crisis in one part of the world and then suddenly it shifts , and it 's becoming more of an epidemic somewhere else			0
" the @entity10 says that $ 50 will feed a child for an entire school year and just $ 5 can feed a child in @entity99 for a month			2
the simple economics of those statements prompted the designer to get creative			0
product with a purpose @entity8 has designed a watch to help raise money for the @entity10			1
the @entity107 involves the sale of four special - edition 100 series watches for $ 295 each			1
a portion of the proceeds from each watch will deliver 100 meals to hungry children through the @entity10			1
" i wanted something that was direct , " @entity8 said			2
" you look at your watch , every time it says the 100 series watch , so you 're reminded that there 's the 100 meals			1
how fantastic is that ? i 'm not a scientist			0
you know , i 'm a fashion designer			0
i would n't claim to be able to figure out a cure for an incurable disease			0
but i know we can make a difference with this			0
" the fashion designer and the actress say they just want to raise awareness about hunger , and their celebrity gives them a platform to " make some noise			2
" and what about the baby ? in addition to her new work with @entity8 and the @entity10 , @entity26 is expecting her first child with @entity146 © @entity145			1
this has been the biggest surprise of my life , to tell you the truth			0
thought i was kind of past the point where this could be a reality for me			0
so it 's been a big surprise and the most wonderful , " said @entity26 , 46			0
