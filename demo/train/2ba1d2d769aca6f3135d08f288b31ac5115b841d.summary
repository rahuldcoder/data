have you ever thrown away a banana peel or dumped expired milk into the garbage ? well , if you do it in @entity6 you are in for a fine			0
under a new policy , passed 9 - 0 by the @entity9 earlier this week , those who fail to compost " food waste and compostable paper " will be penalized			1
the new program will come into effect in january 2015 for commercial establishments and residences			2
it will be enforced by the @entity18			0
@entity6 has had a similar rule for noncompostable recyclables for nine years			0
after receiving two warnings , residents and businesses will be fined $ 50 for dumpsters and a more modest $ 1 for waste at single - family homes			1
previously , the utilities commission left residents and businesses a note that asked them to compost			2
if they did not comply , the city refused to collect the garbage			2
4 ways to combat food waste at home so , why is @entity6 making residents compost ? the city was not going to meet its self - imposed goal of recycling 60 % of all waste			1
" compostables are about 30 % of what is still in the garbage and they are the largest target we have to help us reach our goals , " said @entity41 , solid waste director of the utilities commission , which asked the city council for the change			1
" also , composting food waste reduces emissions of methane , which is a strong cause of climate change			1
" although the utilities commission contends inspecting garbage and issuing fines for noncompliance will have " minimal costs " and save money in the long run by reducing landfill usage , not everyone agrees			2
" this program is not free , it costs money and nobody is looking at the real cost of this [ program ] , " said @entity65 , environment director for the conservative @entity66			1
opinion : composting in a city : are you kidding ? @entity65 said the program costs could be put to better use			1

but @entity41 said the program is worth it			0
" nine years ago , we prohibited recyclable paper and containers from the garbage and this created a significant rise in our recycling rate , " @entity41 said			0
the program is modeled on a similar one instituted in @entity94 in 2009			1
last year , then - mayor @entity95 proposed requiring @entity97 residents to compost			0
@entity97 's city council only extended the requirement to commercial establishments .			0
