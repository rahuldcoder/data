-- former @entity2 president @entity1 will consider returning to politics to save his floundering center - right party , not because he wants to but because of patriotic " duty , " according to an article to be published thursday in a right - leaning magazine			1
in an eight - page special called " in the head of @entity1 , " the former president discusses his political future in public for the first time			2
he is quoted as saying in @entity15 magazine that he has no desire to return to politics , a world that " bores him to death , " and balks at the task of " picking up @entity2 in the state where the @entity23 will leave it			1
" but , @entity1 said , " there will be unfortunately a moment when the question will no longer be : ' do you want to ? ' but ' do you have a choice ? ' " " in this case , i can not continue to say : ' i am happy , i take my daughter to school and i give conferences all around the world			2
' in this case , effectively , i will be obliged to come back			0
only because it is for @entity2			0
" according to a @entity42 released wednesday , 56 % of the supporters of his party -- the @entity40 , known as @entity40 -- prefer @entity1 as their candidate for the 2017 presidential election			1
in the article , @entity1 criticizes president @entity46 , saying the @entity23 leader " has smashed everything that i managed to build with ( @entity49 chancellor ) @entity48			1
not because he does not get along with her but because his politics are completely opposed to that of @entity49			0
" on the subject of @entity55 , @entity1 questioned the government 's purpose : " what are we doing over there ? apart from supporting coup - makers and attempting to control a country that is three times the size of @entity2 with 4,000 men ? " since being defeated by @entity46 last may -- and vowing never to return to politics -- @entity1 has kept a low profile , working at his law firm in central @entity67			1
but rumors of a comeback have intensified since the @entity40 's confused attempt to elect a successor last november , in which both candidates @entity73 and @entity74 claimed victory amid intraparty squabbling and allegations of vote - rigging			0
after a two - day gridlock , @entity74 was declared the winner			0
@entity73 disputed this and the pair eventually agreed to a re-election later this year .			0
