-- there were nights this season when college basketball was compelling , but more nights when it looked dysfunctional			1
there were nights that featured the spectacular @entity9 of @entity10 going for 39 in an overtime win at @entity12 this week , but many other nights that featured a confounding loss of artistry on offense			2
the game has wheezed and sputtered for three months			1
it dropped a few goblets of oil from the underside of the carriage with games where teams struggled to score 25 points in a half			2
i am in the business of watching sports , so perhaps that 's why so many people have said to me or sent me an e-mail disappointed at the game they watched the night before			2
@entity35 : @entity10 vs. @entity12 great defense and good defensive coaching can make games look ugly and viewers see night after night that defense has jumped ahead of offense in the college game			1
but now it 's march and the college game will fire up a brand new ride for @entity46			1
it will capture the hearts of sporting @entity49 as it winds its way through the exalted office tournament pools			2
but what to do with the old jalopy ? it needs more than new wheels and a fresh coat of paint that will come with the new season in november 2013			1
it needs a real fix			1
scoring ( points per team , per game ) could reach a low not seen since the 1952 season			1
offense is becoming a routine struggle as players cope with physical defense , tight - fisted coaches , technology and the increased size , speed and athleticism of opponents			1
@entity35 : march madness 2013 @entity75 lowered the pitching mound five inches following the 1968 season after pitchers dominated the game from their mountaintops			1
the @entity81 opened up a spigot of offense when it banned hand - checking in 1994 and forearms to the chest of ball handlers facing the basket in 1999			1
hockey started enforcing its rule book as far as restraining fouls for the 2005 - 06 season and scoring went up			1
there is a solution that would work for college basketball			1
but , first , a few that wo n't			2
unplug technology big brother is watching			0
the video - statistical knowledge teams have at their fingerprints has hindered the best - laid plans of many teams this season			1
ninety percent of teams in @entity107 men 's basketball use a service provided by @entity109 that dissects every play , every tendency of an opponent			1
@entity114 coach @entity113 said technology is invaluable in scouting an opponents ' offense and understanding the opposition 's strengths			0
defense has gotten ahead of offense partly because of this advanced scouting			0
one coach knows the other coach and his favorite plays			0
teams are not only dissecting opponents , they are creating dossiers of referees			0
what has been the tendency of a referee the last five games to how he makes calls ? well , here it is on the video			0
referee assignments are made before the season in some conferences , a few days before games in other conferences , so there is plenty of time to scout a zebra before he shows up			1
officials in basketball influence the game more than any other sport , so knowing who is calling your game or how it will be called is paramount to coaches			1
play defense without fouling defenders are loathe to give up a layup not only because it is two points but also because coaches are screamers and berate kids endlessly about defensive breakdowns			1
it 's like a slow roller through the first baseman 's legs			0
what kid wants an earful of abuse ? so the defender fouls with a slight push , which means the dunk at the rim , one of the most exciting plays in the game , is rare			0
players need to be forced by the rules to back up to keep a guy in front of them			1
let the offensive player shoot the jumper , or risk a foul when you hand check , like the @entity81			0
players have to be made to play defense with their feet by the referee			1
the benefit is coaches might actually stop working on defense 70 percent of the time in practice and work on shooting			2
if there are going to be more open shots , it makes sense to practice them			0
it would also help the college player going to the @entity81 where hand - checking is usually not allowed			1
send the players to the bench coaches want players to get physical and dare the referee to invite the wrath of the ticket buyer by whistling every chuck and hand - check			1
if the refs called everything ear muffs would have to be given out at the door and there would be maddening stop - and - go action			2
well , they need to call everything			0
stop the bullying and strip - searching of the ball handler once and for all			2
@entity223 officiating the ultimate new rule would be to put referees under one system			0
right now , they are ruled by each conference office , which is a fiefdom that is loathed to relent power			0
the @entity230 could create satellite offices around the country and assign officials to that office			0
do it like the @entity81			0
grade them , kick the worst out at the end of every season			2
the refs are independent contractors and some of them are lawyers			0
they might use their day job to protect their night job and sue to work independently			0
one coach , who did not want to be named because it might invite the wrath of refs , said consistency in officiating around the country would be enhanced if there was a centralized authority			0
enforce the rule book good luck			0
there is one rule book in college basketball , but many interpretations of that rule book			1
@entity261 , the @entity230 coordinator of officials , started a movement toward @entity264 five years ago and one of the ways to accomplish that was to ask referees to " call the rule book			2
" that means calling three seconds in the lane to eliminate the shoving for position , whistling post defenders for excessive arm bars to the back , calling hand - checking and blowing the whistle when physical defenders drive dribblers into the sidelines with chest bumps			2
i had the referee coordinator of a conference tell me that no harm , no foul is fine			0
no , it 's not , says @entity261			0
a foul is a foul			0
reduce the wrestling match in the lane @entity113 , the @entity114 coach , said the game is too physical in the paint and the contact has to be reduced			0
here 's a thought : call three seconds on the offensive player			0
he is not allowed to stand in there four seconds			0
if there is nobody in there for the defender to wrestle with you have a solution : no scrum			0
give coaches more time to work with players in the offseason @entity309 , the coach at @entity310 , said there will be a transformation in the game within two years if the @entity230 allowed college basketball coaches to work more individually with players			1
the @entity230 , of course , will tell coaches to quit spending so much time on defense in practice			2
coaches are going to be told to use their time more wisely			2
the coaches are getting some blame for the choking of offense			2
they want to let their teams run and gun , but then they see poor decision making in a fast game , which is followed by a turnover			0
turnovers do not look good when committed in front of the athletic director , who is the coach 's boss			0
@entity35 : how small ball saved @entity334 ' season the fans and media hiss at slow , deliberate play , but when a pass sails out of bounds on the break and the player tries to be the least bit creative , the player is labeled careless and it is back to walk - it - up basketball			1
now , finally , here 's the solution : the solution is a 24 - second shot clock the game will be quicker and more fun			1
it will eliminate the walk - it - up style and the boring high - ball screen and the same old offense with the current 35 - second clock			1
the coaches will have to let go of the reins and allow more freedom of movement for their players			1
" i have petitioned @entity362 for the last three years to let us go to a 24 - second clock , " said @entity361 head coach @entity360			1
" it would help our entire league in recruiting because we can be the closest thing to the @entity81			0
" more possessions equal a faster game			0
but it is not going to happen			0
the have - nots think they will be buried by the @entity378 , @entity379 and @entity380 of the world who have more talent			2
the best we will do is a 30 - second clock like the women			1
it might be that college basketball looks at @entity389 where college basketball numbers have stayed the same this year compared to last and figure the game is fine like it is			1
but , just maybe , more seasons like this last one , where scoring suffered , will convince the caretakers of the game to upgrade offense so the public does n't have to wait until march for the game to be compelling again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity401 .			1

@entity401 : college basketball " has wheezed and sputtered for three months "
writer says the new season needs a real fix when it begins in november
@entity401 : a 24 - second shot clock will be quicker and more fun
he believes coaches should allow more freedom of movement among players
