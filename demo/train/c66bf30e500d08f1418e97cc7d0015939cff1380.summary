-- investing in climate change initiatives can be a business opportunity for companies , according to the deputy chief executive of @entity6 banking giant @entity5			1
" it makes perfect commercial sense , " @entity7 told @entity0 's @entity8 on the sidelines of the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
" sustainability is important in the long term			1
" negotiators from 195 countries descended on @entity11 last week to discuss climate change and find ways to finance efforts to reduce co2 emissions			2
@entity22 said it 's important that governments take the lead on policy issues and called business people to follow suit in partnership with other organs of the society			1
" we , as bankers , will take direction from the authorities on what happens at cop 17 , we stand ready to be supportive , " he said			0
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : why does it make sense for business to be leading the way perhaps when it comes to issues about climate change ? @entity7 : i think even for business , sustainability is important in the long term , it 's important because we all want to do something about environmental degradation , acting astute in financial institutions for example			1
we want to leave our businesses in better shape than we found them for future generations but , broader than that , it 's also a business opportunity because of the various mechanisms that apply			1
@entity0 : so it need not be a drain on finance -- investing in climate change initiatives can make money			1
@entity68 : it makes perfect commercial sense			0
@entity0 : why ? give me some examples			0
@entity68 : so , here in @entity12 , we 've just been through a major program : the first part of a process in terms of which the government is allowing independent power producers to enter the grid			0
we have approved over 12 billion rands worth of these projects , we 're participating in at least half of them			0
now they may not be granted , they may not be approved by the authorities , but there 's a large number of them where we 're participating			1
we perceive this as a new asset class , consistent with sustainability			2
@entity0 : sometimes there 's a sense that if this is going to work , it 's going to be very bottom up			2
the politicians can go on talking and trying to agree on targets but it 's people on the ground , it 's businesses , that are quietly doing their own thing , and you 're helping perhaps to facilitate that			2
@entity68 : frankly , the legitimate democratically - elected government must take the lead on policy , and business as an organ of society , together with other organs of society , must follow and do what they need to do , having regard to what they do for a living			2
we , as bankers , will take direction from the authorities on what happens at cop 17 , we stand ready to be supportive , we support the white paper on climate change in @entity12			0
so my argument to you is , yes it 's important for the authorities to take the lead , business as organs of civil society must do what they need to do in buying and selling their products and they must act in consent and in partnership with society , but wanting to make money in the process -- we 're not a charity , we 're a business after all			1
@entity0 : this is the end of the year , looking back , what have been the biggest challenges for you ? @entity68 : the big challenges have been , as a banker , a difficulty in lending out money , because both corporate and consumers have been de-leveraging , they 've been borrowing less than we would like them to			1
the result of that for a bank is that we do n't make as much net interest income , we do n't generate as much revenues as we would have liked to			0
people are buying and selling fewer goods , so transactions and fees and commissions as a consequence are less			0
and yet , we 've got thousands of people that we employ -- we employ over 50,000 people throughout the world -- the bulk of which are on the @entity170 continent , they have to be paid regardless of whether you and i transact .			0
