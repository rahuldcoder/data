-- the @entity1 leads the world in the rate of incarcerating its own citizens			1
we imprison more of our own people than any other country on earth , including @entity9 which has four times our population , or in human history			1
and now , a new @entity13 report announces that we are keeping even nonviolent inmates behind bars for increasingly longer terms			1
this comes at a time when soaring costs of prisons are wreaking havoc on federal , state and local budgets , as schools , libraries , parks and social programs are slashed			2
when i graduated from the @entity30 at @entity31 in 1983 , my state spent more on higher education than prisons , a lot more			1
that equation is now reversed			0
money that could have gone into reducing skyrocketing tuition and cuts to education has instead gone to prisons and inmates			1
over the past 23 years , @entity42 constructed roughly one new prison per year , at a cost of $ 100 million each , while it built only one new public college during the same period			0
nationwide , spending on prisons has risen six times faster than spending on higher education			1
as i protest education cuts , i 'm so often told , " we just do n't have the money			1
" it 's a lie			0
we do have the money			0
we just choose to spend it on prisons			2
why is this not a front and center issue in the presidential campaign ? largely casualties of our misguided " war on drugs , " and vigorously promoted at the federal level by the " drug czar " and a $ 15 billion annual budget , the number of incarcerated @entity1 has quadrupled since 1980			1
more than two million of our people are now locked up , with another nearly five million under an increasingly restrictive system of correctional control in lieu of or after incarceration			2
criminalizing human behavior like never before , our judges are required by law to mete out increasingly punitive , long sentences , even for children			0
even after inmates are released , they remain under the heavy - handed and pricey control of the criminal justice system for years or for life , often legally barred from voting , receiving public housing , food stamps or student loans			0
forced to " check the box " on job applications that they are convicted criminals , even those who have had simple convictions like marijuana possession are often legally discriminated against by employers			0
an unemployed young man recently wrote to me about being shut out of his dream job , nursing , because of a decade - old marijuana offense			0
in fact , no one at all will hire him			0
as he languishes on a friend 's couch , he is hopeless , depressed and suicidal			0
in the @entity1 , one man out of eighteen is incarcerated or on probation or parole , and more are locked up every day			1
we are the last developed country on the planet to lock up juveniles , overwhelmingly boys , for life - without - parole sentences for crimes committed when they were minors			0
( though the @entity112 banned mandatory life - without - parole sentences for minors in june , judges may still impose the sentence as a discretionary matter			0
) here 's one stark way to understand our new normal of mass incarceration : if we wanted to return to 1970s level of incarceration , we 'd have to release four out of five people behind bars today			2
nonviolent offenders are 60 % of our prison population			1
releasing half of them would free up nearly $ 17 billion per year for schools or other worthy programs , with no appreciable effect on the crime rate			0
in fact , many studies conclude that mass incarceration is crimogenic , i.e. , locking up people for minor offenses increases crime because they become hardened behind bars			2
since few prisons offer therapy or vocational programs and children left behind in fatherless homes are more likely to grow up to become offenders themselves , the problem just gets worse			1
but we can not keep going down the road of locking up more people for longer amounts of time			2
according to @entity13 , prisoners released in 2009 served an average of nine additional months in custody , or 36 % longer , than offenders released in 1990			2
annually we now spend $ 68 billion and growing on local , state and federal corrections			0
the @entity1 public strongly supports reducing time served for nonviolent offenders			1
but candidates appear afraid to touch this touchy third rail issue , for fear they appear less than " tough on crime			2
" why does the right not consider our multibillion - dollar prison system to be the type of bloated government program ripe for cost - cutting ? why is the left so rarely concerned about the warehoused young lives and the destruction of inner city families from our culture of mass incarceration ? why do both sides accept the framing of this question , so often parroted : in these tough economic times , should we cut more social services or raise taxes ? it 's a false dichotomy			0
the third alternative is to stop warehousing our own people			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

the number of incarcerated @entity1 has quadrupled since 1980
@entity184 : we need to stop warehousing our own people , especially nonviolent offenders
she says spending on prisons has risen six times faster than spending on higher education
@entity184 : why is n't this front and center issue in the presidential campaign ?
