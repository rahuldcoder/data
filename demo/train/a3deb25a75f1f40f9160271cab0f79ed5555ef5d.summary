for a society that regards conformity as an important value , there are surprising number of @entity5 who opt for homes that defy the cookie - cutter design			1
take for example , @entity10 and his wife @entity11 who lives in a house with no interior walls , hardly any barriers and some ladders to get around			0
the young couple call their house the @entity19 -- because they need to be as nimble as one to go from one room to another			2
" we feel we 're getting in better shape these days , " says @entity22 , extolling the benefits of all the climbing around the house			0
" but we never fall			0
" radical design is featuring more and more in @entity5 's residential landscape and is a hit among the country 's young generation			1
it is as if the compact spaces the @entity5 have to live in are pushing the architects , and their clients , to think out of the box and let their whimsical ideas take off			1
says @entity22 : " i do n't know if this is a cutting edge , but this is a house where our thoughts and inspirations take place			0
" avant - garde design in @entity5 largely caters to middle class couples or families building a small house , not the typical clientele of bold architectural ideas elsewhere in the world			1
these average @entity5 home owners can afford to take more risks because , unlike many of their counterparts in the @entity56 , they do n't have to worry about long - term investment			1
" houses depreciate in value over 15 years after being built , " says @entity59 - based architect @entity58 , " and on average they are demolished after 25 or 30 years , so the owner of a house does n't need to consider what a future buyer might want			2
" it gives them a lot of creative license to design a home that 's an expression of their own eccentricities or lifestyle			1
" open a @entity5 architecture magazine or browse the @entity76 , and there are many examples of eccentric homes across the country , from strange polygonal structures to houses with no windows			1
while this conceptual @entity5 architecture could be a bit impractical , these homes are becoming more like modern - art installations breathing new life into the country 's cramped spaces			1
some of the more quirky homes are built next to plain - looking buildings			1
architect @entity95 's " @entity94 " stands out in an average @entity59 neighborhood			2
the transparent building , which he built for a young couple , lacks in privacy but conjures a sense of open elegance			2
calling the design " kind of a tree house , " @entity95 says , " we thought the whole house is like one big tree			0
you can jump onto one branch and the other branch to move around			0
" he also argues that the house fits @entity59 's character as one part of the cozy components that make up the city			0
" i think it 's a really , really nice collaboration because at the beginning , it was more simple , a bit more boring , " he says			0
" then it 's getting more exciting			0
