@entity0 -- the image lasts just four seconds , flashed on the screen during the opening sequence of a @entity6 news program posted online			1
it 's of an elderly man kneeling on a church pew , his lips moving as though in prayer , and it 's given new hope to a woman in @entity0 who has n't heard from 30 members of her family since @entity16 smashed into @entity17 in the @entity6 last friday			1
" we think this is my uncle ! they look identical ! " @entity22 wrote in an email to @entity1 , after receiving an overnight message from her sister , @entity25 , in @entity26 , who 's been scanning online news in the hope of seeing a familiar face			1
the lone , elderly man in silent prayer bears a striking resemblance to 68 - year - old @entity36 , the patriarch of the sprawling @entity38 family who all but disappeared during the storm			1
" she was staring at the video clips and he was there in one of them			0
but his wife was n't and his children were n't , " @entity22 said from her home in @entity0 , her joy of seeing her uncle tempered by the thought of those who were n't there , or could n't be seen			1
the family recognizes the church as the @entity17 , a distinctive pink @entity55 just one block from the coast where a devastating storm surge swept in , killing hundreds , if not thousands of people			2
the church withstood the storm , though its towering spire has been stripped of its roofing , as has most of the main building			0
yet , it was there that the man suspected to be @entity38 can be seen praying , as he has done countless times before			2
his family lived just streets away			2
the possible reappearance of her uncle four days after the typhoon was not the only news raising @entity22 's hopes that more relatives can be found			1
on the same day , it emerged her cousin @entity78 and her five children , aged between nine and 19 , had made it out of the storm			0
@entity22 has no idea how or where they are , but a family member passed on the news that they 're safe and have since left @entity86			1
@entity22 says she expected to feel elation after finding some members of her missing family , but days of worry have left her emotionally exhausted			1
" you think about what 's going to happen when you find them , that it 's going to be relief and joy and happiness and it was n't , " she said			2
" i checked them off the list and moved onto my uncle			0
and now i 've checked him off the list , now i 'm moving on to someone else			0
there 's so much going on , feeling relief is impossible in this situation			0
" her thoughts have now turned to her other cousin , @entity38 , his wife @entity110 , and their three young children , aged from four to eight years old			0
the @entity112 hit the @entity6 coast just before 5 a.m. last friday , flattening buildings , swamping homes and businesses with flood water and leaving a trail of destruction authorities and locals are still trying to comprehend			1
" i 'm so tired at this point			0
i 'm not negative about the situation but whatever happens , happens , at this point , " @entity22 said			2
" but i want the kids out			0
the thought of them living with bodies lining the streets -- it 's pure misery there , "			0
