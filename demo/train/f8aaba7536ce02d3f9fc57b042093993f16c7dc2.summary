@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 ethos may be centered on the pursuit of athletic excellence , but performance - enhancing drugs offer a way for competitors to gain @entity4 glory via unfair advantage			1
to the frustration of many , the use of illegal substances has marred all recent @entity4 , and @entity15 has been no different			1
two athletes , @entity18 weightlifter @entity17 and @entity19 of @entity20 , have already been sent home from the @entity23 capital after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol and the diuretic furosemide respectively			0
so what is the process of screening for banned substances and why , despite all the risks involved , do athletes try so hard to get away with using them ? the history of doping and the @entity4 according to @entity39 ( @entity40 ) the practice of using " substances and artificial ways of enhancing performance " is as old as organized sport itself			1
in @entity44 , athletes used special diets and stimulants to improve their chances of winning the athletics competitions , while roman emperor @entity49 allegedly drank a potion of wild boar 's manure to aid his performance in the @entity4			1
when @entity56 cyclist @entity55 died at the @entity57 in @entity58 , his autopsy revealed traces of amphetamine , and the following outcry led to drug testing being adopted by the world cycling and football federations -- as well as the @entity65 in time for @entity66 ' 68			1
screening for drug cheats has been a crucial process in each @entity4 since this time , and led to the @entity65 creating a prohibited list of substances the system has uncovered state - sponsored doping programs , such as those employed by @entity75 in the 1970s and ' 80s and @entity77 in the 1990s , as well as individual cases , such as the infamous @entity80 100 - meter runner @entity79 and @entity82 sprinter @entity81			1
over the last five @entity4 an average of 12 athletes per event have been found guilty of taking banned substances			2
technology has played a crucial role too -- with each advance in the screening process used by organizers , there is an advance by dope cheats in the complexity of drugs used to avoid detection			1
@entity99 ( @entity99 ) director general @entity98 told @entity2 the list of banned substances runs to 10 - 15 pages , with hundreds of drugs currently prohibited			2
" the fight continues and the sophistication continues on both sides , " he said			0
" you find that athletes and those that advise athletes are more sophisticated in what they do than they were 10 years ago			0
" what do the drugs do ? " anabolic steroids provide muscle fiber and bulk , whereas a hormone like erythropoietin ( @entity119 ) brings more red blood cells to the system , " says @entity113 , former @entity65 vice president and former president of @entity99			1
" more red blood cells brings more oxygen to the muscles , so the athlete has more energy			0
that 's why some athletes take blood transfusions before their races , to boost this count			0
" stimulants can increase heart rate , human growth hormone promotes muscle and bone growth and reduces body fat			0
it can help strength , power , stamina , improves recovery time so you can train harder and for longer			0
but archers may take drugs that have the opposite affects , to reduce the tremor in their hands , " @entity113 told @entity2			1
" they say drugs can make 1 % of a difference , but 1 % over the distance of 100m is a tenth of a second , that 's huge ! you can imagine what it would do over a marathon			1
" because all these drugs are under the radar and their use is covert we do n't have test groups to know what damage this does to the human body			2
but you could expect liver damage , high blood pressure , androgynization of females			0
if you take @entity119 your blood becomes like sludge , your heart ca n't pump this stuff through the system			0
" what is new for @entity15 ? the @entity176 is the first to use a private company , in this case @entity179 , to help provide logistics for drug screening			1
professor @entity182 , director of @entity184 's @entity183 and chief scientist for the @entity4 , is in charge of the @entity179 lab. " these laboratories are the most high - tech labs in the history of the @entity4 , analyzing more samples than ever before , " @entity188 told @entity2			1
" across the range of instruments in the lab , we reckon we can pick up things you have n't even thought of and we can test retrospectively if new drugs are developed			2
" " i think we 'll soon be away from the days where designer drugs beat the analyst			2
i 'm hoping this will be the games that actually prove that			0
" at @entity15 , the athletes themselves seal the bottles and fill in the paperwork , in order to minimize the contamination risk , and only then are the samples opened by a specialist in the testing lab. which athletes are screened ? screening operates in the following way : -- athletes are screened in the run - up to the @entity4 and can face repeat tests after the competition period of july 27 - august 12			1
-- the first five finishers in every event are chaperoned immediately to give mandatory tests , with samples of both blood and urine taken , and then from another two athletes at random			1
-- samples are collected straight after the event at the relevant venue and split into two lots : " a " and " @entity234 " -- there are also unannounced spot tests conducted at random , both inside the @entity237 and at other athlete accommodation			1
-- test results are processed with the " a " sample ( as depicted above ) usually within 24 to 72 hours -- some substances , like the hormone @entity119 , can take longer to screen			0
-- the " b " sample is retained for any further backup testing that might be needed			0
-- @entity65 officials comment only when drug tests fail			1
-- any refusal to provide a sample will lead to expulsion , as was the case with @entity253 discus thrower @entity251 ahead of the opening ceremony			0
what happens if an athlete tests positive ? if the " a " sample shows positive , the @entity65 will start its investigation procedure			2
the athlete in question has the opportunity to ask for the " b " sample to also be tested , and can be present when the sample is opened to verify there has been no contamination			0
if this also returns a positive reading , the @entity65 and the involved sport 's national association will hear the athlete 's reasoning before deciding on whether a violation has been committed			2
for those found guilty , the @entity65 will recommend sanctions to the national body			0
is enough being done ? " the equipment and technology is better in @entity1 , and the knowledge is more extensive , " @entity276 says			0
" but if you 're a sophisticated doper and you test positive , you fail two tests : a drugs test and an iq test			1
you need programs that are randomly tested over long periods			0
" we know we 're not catching all the drug users			2
we 're catching maybe 20 % of the sophisticated users , it 's a big problem			2
what 's going on now is that athletes are taking advantage of the fact you are allowed four times the amount of normal levels of testosterone if you 're competing			0
" so now they can inject a pellet into their butt which will slow - release small doses of testosterone but wo n't go over the threshold			0
we have tests to find artificial testosterone , but the games ( of catching them ) go on			1
we 're getting better , but we need to keep getting better -- and the labs need to test for everything on the list			0
" you 'd be pretty ambitious to say @entity15 was a clean games			1
there are drugs we do n't know about yet so we need to keep finding them and hunting down the distribution networks			2

artificial ways of enhancing performance is as old as organized sport itself
