-- @entity4 president @entity3 has waited too long to address the instability in @entity6 , putting at risk the efforts to stabilize the troubled country , a pair of authors said monday			1
historian @entity10 and journalist @entity11 told @entity0 's @entity12 that @entity4 policy toward @entity6 has drifted as the @entity3 administration has tried to focus on domestic priorities			1
the president is scheduled to unveil a new policy toward @entity6 with a much anticipated speech at the @entity19 at @entity20 , @entity21 , on tuesday night			1
many observers expect him to announce he will send an additional 30,000 @entity4 troops , on top of the 68,000 already in @entity6			1
" @entity3 has to make the case that we need 100,000 @entity4 troops in @entity6 , which is what it will be after this surge , in order to protect our own streets from @entity39 , " said @entity11 , staff writer for @entity27 magazine and author of the " @entity31 " blog and several books			1
" that is the case he tried to make in march , and he 's going to have to make it again , because that is his strategy			2
it 's not going to change very much			0
" @entity11 faulted the @entity44 for concentrating on domestic issues , including health care reform and @entity4 economic stability , and for the president failing to give a major speech on @entity6 since march 2009 , a silence that allowed public attention to slip			1
" it 's as if the @entity44 thought , ' one speech and then we can turn our attention to other business , because we do n't really want our first year to be about @entity6			2
we do n't want the president out there continually , you know , beating the war drums when we 've got all these other important issues , which are the issues that got him elected			0
' " but @entity6 did n't care about the @entity44 's communications strategy , and the war went downhill very fast			1
" @entity11 said that the @entity4 should look for success rather than victory in @entity6 , with " success " being defined as a relatively stable government in @entity69 capable of preventing extremists from taking over or making the country ungovernable			2
@entity72 professor @entity10 , author of the multiple - volume " @entity73 , " urged @entity3 to return to the multifaceted role he had achieved as a candidate , willing to address many issues at the same time			2
" he ca n't quite ever decide whether he 's mr. @entity77 or mr. multitask			0
he was actually elected to be president @entity81 , i think , " @entity10 said			0
" and there are certain moments in the life of our great republic , actually , when no matter what the health reform is , no matter how much in deep doo - doo the economy is , the nation really is hungry for the utterance of a commander in chief			0
" share your views on @entity3 's @entity6 decision @entity10 called on the president to aspire to be like one of the country 's greatest leaders , @entity99 , who has served as a kind of touchstone for @entity3			1
the @entity3 presidential campaign actually began on the steps of the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , in which @entity99 made his " @entity110 " speech			0
" @entity3 , you 've got to be @entity99 tomorrow night , " @entity10 said			0
" you 've got to tell the story beautifully , truthfully , honestly and bravely			0
