-- a tip from an acquaintance of one of two convicted murderers who were mistakenly released from prison led to their arrests at a @entity11 motel , the commissioner of the @entity2 said sunday			1
@entity13 and @entity14 were unarmed when they were taken into custody saturday evening in @entity17 , where they were waiting for their ride to arrive from @entity20 , @entity12 said			2
it was unclear where the men expected to go , he said			1
he said a " close associate " informed authorities that the men were in the area			1
@entity12 said they were arrested by themselves without incident at the @entity30			2
they had been in @entity32 for only 48 hours , he said			0
@entity13 and @entity14 will be held without bail and make their next court appearances friday , a @entity32 , @entity11 , judge said sunday			1
he said the two will be held with probable cause for one count each of escape			1
there will be more arrests , @entity12 predicted			0
" they had to have had help ( after their escape ) -- and a lot of help -- to get where they were last night , " he said			1
the state @entity52 -- which mistakenly released the men , though it has insisted it was through no fault of its own -- said little about the arrests			1
cell phone video obtained by @entity0 from another guest at the motel shows @entity61 marshals storming the men 's room , guns drawn			1
authorities had been searching for @entity13 and @entity14 , both 34 , after investigators discovered that the motions to reduce their respective sentences and court orders granting the requests had been forged			1
both killers had been convicted and sentenced to life behind bars without the possibility of parole within two years of their crimes			1
in september 1998 , @entity14 killed @entity76 during a home - invasion robbery attempt			0
six months later , @entity78 was gunned down on an @entity80 street corner -- shot dead , a jury determined , by @entity13			0
@entity14 left the prison in @entity83 , in the @entity84 , on september 27 , and @entity13 left on october 8 , according to authorities			1
on saturday , family members of both men denied any knowledge of the escape plans			1
the legal - looking documents the men used contained bogus reproductions of several key players ' signatures , including those of the @entity80 - area state attorney @entity96 or the assistant state attorney and judge @entity98			1
they bore the seal of the @entity101 clerk of court 's office			1
" they are excellent fakes , " @entity98 said			0
the judge said his signature is easy to find online on documents related to the high - profile trial of @entity109			2
@entity110 was acquitted in the death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity109			0
" people , particularly people with criminal minds , come up with ingenious ways to beat the system , " @entity98 said			0
" they have nothing but time on their hands to think of things			0
" he stressed to @entity0 's @entity120 on sunday that he had nothing to do with the cases in question -- that they were assigned to other judges			2
" when your name and documents that you 've signed are plastered on the internet for anybody and everybody to see , and someone with basic knowledge can paste and cut your signature , it does n't surprise me that it did happen			2
it was just a matter of time , " @entity98 said			0
" it shows that we need to do a little bit more in authentication of documents			1
" prosecutors learned about what happened after a member of @entity13 's family contacted them , @entity96 , the state attorney , said			2
an october 8 letter from the @entity52 to @entity78 's mother , @entity147 , notified her a " court order and amended sentence caused ( @entity13 's ) sentence to expire			1
" " please be aware that recent actions causing the release of this offender are beyond our control			0
nevertheless , we apologize for the delay in this message , " it said			0
@entity159 , secretary of the @entity52 , said he was confident in the procedure to release prisoners , but " obviously there was a gap somewhere			0
" from now on , prison officials will be required to check with the judge to make sure a release order is legitimate , he said			0
@entity12 said there have been two other instances in which inmates attempted to use false documents to gain release , but officials prevented them from escaping			2
both @entity13 and @entity14 appeared to play by the rules after their release			0
they went to the @entity101 jail to register as felons -- jenkins on september 30 , @entity13 on october 11 -- as required by law			0
though their releases may have initially seemed legitimate , the two convicts later were classified as escapees			0
@entity0 's @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			2
