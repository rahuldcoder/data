the @entity0 gave final approval thursday to a roughly 1,200 - page bill that promises to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986 , creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents while ratcheting up security along the @entity10 border			1
senators passed the sweeping legislation -- initially drafted by the four @entity13 and four @entity14 in the chamber 's so - called " @entity15 " -- by a 68 - 32 vote			1
fourteen @entity14 joined a united @entity13 caucus in supporting the bill , which is backed by the @entity20 and has the potential to become the crowning legislative achievement of president @entity24 's second term			1
in a @entity20 statement , @entity24 hailed the @entity0 vote as " a critical step " toward fixing what he called a broken immigration system			1
he labeled the measure that now goes to the @entity14 - controlled @entity20 a compromise , adding that " we just need @entity33 to finish the job			1
" the @entity0 vote included a rare adherence to old - fashioned protocol			1
vice president @entity37 presided in his constitutional capacity as head of the @entity0 , and senators voted one - by - one from their desks , calling out " aye " or " no. " @entity14 sen. @entity43 of @entity44 broke the drama of the moment when he mistakenly voted " aye , " then quickly asked the clerk to make it " no " as the chamber erupted in laughter			1
@entity37 tapped his gavel and called for order			0
before announcing the result , @entity37 warned against outbursts from the public gallery , but chants of " yes we can " and " @entity57 " broke out after he read the tally			0
@entity37 called for the sergeant at arms to restore order			0
" today is another historic day in the @entity0 , " said sen. @entity62 , @entity63			2
" this legislation will reunite families			0
it will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal system			0
it will spur job growth and reduce our deficit			0
and it will make us safer			0
" " the time has come to act in the interest of all @entity79 , " declared sen. @entity75 , @entity76 , a member of the @entity15			0
" i hope that message will be heard loud and clear in the @entity20 ( of representatives )			2
" historic ruling opens door for immigration for same - sex spouses most congressional conservatives , however , remain staunchly opposed to the measure , and have declared it dead on arrival in the @entity20			1
@entity24 warned in his statement that opponents of immigration reform will try even harder to derail it			1
noting the broad support for the @entity0 bill from the business community , organized labor and others , he urged people to contact their @entity20 representatives and " tell them to do the right thing			1
" republicans are sharply divided over the politically sensitive issue			0
in the wake of the @entity14 's crushing loss among @entity109 in the 2012 election , many top voices in the party have pushed for an endorsement of some form of a path to citizenship for the country 's roughly 11 million undocumented residents			2
" no one should dispute ( that ) like every sovereign nation on this planet , we have a right to control who comes in			0
but unlike other countries , we are not afraid of people coming in here from other places , " said @entity124 sen. @entity123 , the most prominent @entity14 in the @entity15 and a potential 2016 presidential candidate			0
" i support this reform			0
not just because i believe in immigrants , but because i believe in @entity79 even more			0
" for many of the @entity14 's strongest supporters , any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally is a form of unforgivable amnesty			2
they also do n't trust the @entity24 administration to fully enact the bill 's new border security measures , which are generally opposed by progressives			2
" there 's just no way i can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that today 's assurances wo n't become tomorrow 's disappointments , " said @entity0 minority leader @entity145 , @entity146			2
" we 'll never resolve the immigration problem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can prove that the border is secure as a condition of legalization			0
" @entity0 takes another step toward passing immigration reform sen. @entity162 , @entity163 , called the vote on the measure " largely symbolic " and predicted the bill would ultimately be relegated to the " ash heap of history			1
" if enacted , the measure would create a 13 - year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants , while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on @entity79 's farms			1
a recently added border security amendment -- introduced by @entity14 sens. @entity180 of @entity181 and @entity182 of @entity183 -- would require 20,000 more border agents , complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with @entity10 , and deploy $ 3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by @entity79 forces in @entity190 and @entity191			0
the amendment also strengthens eligibility verification and border entry - exit controls			0
most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the @entity198			1
while @entity182 's and @entity180 's change appeared to sway some reticent republicans in the @entity0 , top @entity199 remained opposed the overall blueprint			2
" apparently some have n't gotten the message : the @entity20 is not going to take up and vote on whatever the @entity0 passes , " said speaker @entity203 , @entity204			1
" we 're going to do our own bill ... and move the legislation that reflects the will of our majority and the will of the @entity79 people			0
" @entity20 @entity14 have indicated their intention to tackle the issue with several smaller proposals instead of one larger bill			2
@entity203 repeated his pledge to block a vote on any immigration measure that does n't have the support of a majority of @entity20 republicans			1
@entity13 contend the @entity0 version would pass the @entity20 if brought to a vote , with a united @entity13 caucus joined by some @entity14			1
the speaker also refused to take a position on whether or not there should be some kind of path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally			2
@entity13 have repeatedly warned they will not agree to a plan that lacks such a path			0
regardless , @entity203 said he hopes the @entity20 will deal with immigration reform this year			1
" i have made it clear since the day after the election that this political football should stop , and that the @entity33 should deal with this issue , " he said			0
