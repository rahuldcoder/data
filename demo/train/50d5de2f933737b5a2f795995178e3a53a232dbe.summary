when a reporter asked @entity1			0
@entity2 whether he felt @entity3 197 at the @entity4 was secure , he answered the only way he could monday			1
" in addition to the gunman , authorities said 12 people were killed and eight others injured when a shooter opened fire in @entity3 at the @entity4			1
earlier , navy vice adm. @entity14 @entity13 had said 14 people were injured			1
located in the heart of the nation 's capital , the @entity4 is home to high - level naval personnel			1
about 3,000 people work there , including junior service members and civilian employees			1
it 's supposed to be a secure facility			2
so what went wrong ? " it 'll be interesting to see as this develops who the shooter is , how he got in , those type of questions answered			0
i think right now a lot of people are wondering , you know , just how safe the building is , or how safe the office environment is , " @entity2 said			2
the @entity40 has identified the suspected shooter as @entity42 , a 34 - year - old military contractor from @entity43			1
he had access to the @entity4 because of his contracting work , and he used a valid pass to gain entry , said @entity48 , assistant director in charge of the @entity51 @entity40 field office			1
@entity2 described how access typically works			2
" i have a @entity62 card , " he said , referring to a common access card , the standard id for active duty uniformed service personnel , @entity57 , @entity59 civilian employees and eligible contractor personnel			0
audit reports @entity4 risked security to cut costs , says source the @entity54 also is the main card used to grant physical access to buildings and other controlled spaces			1
" as a military person , we all have badges that we have to key the door to get in -- that allows us automatic access to the building			0
" but again , if you 're a contractor , if you 're coming to visit the building , you can go through security and walk right in -- not walk right in , but you would check in through security , " @entity2 said			0
even to drive or walk onto the base , a person would be required to present credentials , said @entity4 capt. @entity84			2
building 197 has armed security at the door			0
" there 's a kiosk you go through , and it either gives you a green or a red light , but the green light shows that your credentials are recognized as someone who is supposed to be in that building			0
" so you have to go through a couple of layers of security to get into @entity3 -- first to get access onto the @entity4 , and then through the doors to get in , " @entity84 said			1
@entity101 @entity100 correspondent @entity99 has visited the @entity4 several times over the years for stories			1
victims identified in her experience , security is extensive			0
everyone must have clearance to be there or valid identification that allows them entry			0
if you were an employee of the facility , you would have a parking sticker and go through a checkpoint , @entity99 said			2
a guard would see your sticker , know that you were authorized to be on the compound and allow you to proceed			0
if you were a visitor , as @entity99 would be , you 'd call ahead and have an appointment			2
guards would have your name at the gate , and you would be escorted to wherever you needed to go			0
" so the question , of course , is -- how did somebody get a weapon onto the base ? " she asked			0
" look , it is always possible in these types of situations , theoretically , to find your way around security measures			1
somebody could have had a weapon in their car , unseen , hidden and taken it out			0
" there 's any number of ways it might have happened , " @entity99 said .			1
