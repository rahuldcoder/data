@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 had strong words saturday for @entity4 over what he called its unacceptable actions in @entity8 -- and threatened additional sanctions against @entity4 interests			1
speaking in @entity11 alongside @entity13 foreign secretary @entity12 , @entity0 said @entity4 was " continuing to do land - grabbing in @entity8 " even as it professed to support peace efforts			1
@entity4 's actions are " just simply unacceptable , so we are talking about additional sanctions , additional efforts , " @entity0 said			1
" we are confident that over the next few days we are going to make it clear that we are not going to play this game , not going to sit here and be part of this extraordinarily craven behavior at the expense of the sovereignty and integrity of a nation			0
" this is behavior that is completely counter to everything that the global community has worked to achieve and put in place ever since @entity33 , and i 'm confident that the @entity13 , the @entity1 and others are prepared to stand up to it			2
" he blasted @entity39 's repeated denials that it is involved in arming the separatists and sending its own troops over the border			0
in this age of technology and satellites , @entity0 said , " there is no secret " over what is taking place			0
" we know to a certainty what @entity4 has been providing to the separatists , how @entity4 is involved with the separatists , " he said			2
@entity54 and a number of @entity57 leaders have steadfastly accused @entity4 of failing to rein in separatists and of continuing to arm , supply and train them			2
@entity62 nations , the @entity1 and others have imposed financial sanctions on @entity4 interests in hopes of pressuring president @entity67 to help end the hostilities			1
@entity4 , which seized @entity8 's @entity70 peninsula in march , denies any direct involvement in @entity8 and says any @entity4 soldiers in @entity8 are volunteers fighting during their vacation time @entity0 's remarks come as a ceasefire which came into effect last sunday remains in serious doubt			1
a fierce separatist offensive to take the key strategic town of @entity80 ended only wednesday , when @entity8 soldiers were forced to retreat			1
@entity82 , a presidential adviser and assistant to @entity8 's defense minister , said saturday that 179 soldiers had died in the @entity80 area between january 18 and february 18			1
an additional 110 soldiers were captured and 81 are missing , @entity82 posted on @entity88			0
some of the missing are still on their way out of @entity80 , he said , while others have died			1
late saturday , @entity8 president @entity93 said 139 @entity8 soldiers had been released from captivity			1
the release was part of a prisoner swap between @entity8 and rebel forces in the eastern @entity101 region ; 52 pro-russian separatists were also freed , according to @entity4 state news agency @entity103			1
the toll makes the siege of @entity80 -- a town now shattered by heavy shelling -- the @entity8 military 's deadliest single incident over the past 10 turbulent months			1
@entity110 has also picked up this week in @entity112 city and clashes are reported around the southern port city of @entity115			0
@entity8 's @entity117 and @entity116 said friday there had been 300 instances in which this latest truce has been violated			2
the ceasefire agreement -- signed february 12 in @entity122 , @entity123 , among the leaders of @entity8 , @entity4 , @entity125 and @entity126 -- aimed to curb this violence			1
it is supposed to be followed by the withdrawal of heavy weaponry to create a buffer zone , the release of prisoners and steps toward new elections			0
months of devastating fighting has left nearly 5,700 people dead as of february 18 , the @entity137 @entity136 reported friday			0
more than 1 million people have been displaced			0
on friday , @entity8 marked one year since the bloodiest day of protests in @entity54 's @entity142 , or @entity142 , against the country 's then @entity4 - leaning leader and in favor of closer ties to @entity62			1
some 49 people died on february 20 , 2014 , and close to 100 more suffered gunshot wounds when , according to protesters , government snipers opened fire on them			2
two days later , president @entity152 fled the country , prompting @entity8 activists to declare " victory in the @entity142 " and promise a new day for a country long torn between its neighbors , @entity62 to the west and @entity4 to the east			1
today , the country is a powder keg driving spiraling tensions between the @entity57 and @entity39			0
in @entity39 , thousands of @entity165 supporters gathered saturday for a demonstration to counter the @entity8 commemorations			2
many waved flags and banners as they marched near @entity39 's @entity170 , while others chanted slogans including , " we wo n't give our country to the enemy " and " @entity175 in @entity4			2
" in remarks friday , @entity93 claimed @entity4 had been working toward the breakup of @entity8 since before @entity152 was ousted			1
" @entity39 was preparing to the liquidation and tearing @entity8 apart long before the victory of @entity142			0
they were expecting the fall of @entity152 and accelerated the course of events , " @entity93 said to the families of protesters who died a year ago			0
according to @entity8 prosecutors , 77 people died in total during the 2014 protests , which were sparked by @entity152 's decision to scrap a trade deal with the @entity191 and instead turn toward @entity4			1
the ensuing ouster of @entity152 triggered more turbulence and violence			0
by march , @entity4 had annexed @entity70			0
weeks later , in april , @entity196 separatist forces launched their bid to carve off the more @entity4 - leaning eastern @entity112 and @entity199 regions from the rest of @entity8			1
in a speech to a @entity11 - based defense think - tank , the @entity201 , @entity13 's senior officer in @entity203 warned that @entity4 's expansionist ambitions could pose an " existential threat " to the world			1
@entity4 is currently employing a " hybrid combination " of " coercion through rapidly generated conventional forces and subversion , through a number of means , both military and non-military , " said gen. @entity217 , @entity203 's deputy supreme allied commander @entity62			2
this hybrid strategy can be used to set the scene for a " subversive takeover of territory , " as seen in its takeover of @entity8 's @entity70 peninsula last year shortly after large - scale military exercises by @entity4 on its side of the border , he said			1
" we are today seeing conventional forces employed , albeit subject to continued brazen denials by the @entity165 , in eastern @entity8 , " he added			2
@entity4 's new strategy holds particular dangers for @entity203 , he said			0
firstly , the use of subversive tactics initially makes it difficult to identify clearly " the hand of a hostile state government " in destabilization of a country , making collective decisions harder			0
secondly , its ability rapidly to generate large scale forces " could in future be used not only for intimidation and coercion but potentially to seize @entity203 territory , after which the threat of escalation might be used to prevent reestablishment of territorial integrity , " he said			0
and , @entity217 pointed out , @entity4 is not the only threat to @entity203 states , citing also the danger posed by terror groups such as @entity257 , also known as @entity257			0
" whilst the threat from @entity4 , together with the risk it brings of a miscalculation resulting in a slide into strategic conflict , however unlikely we see that as being right now , represents an obvious existential threat to our whole being , we of course face threats from @entity257 and other instabilities to our way of life and the security of our loved ones			0
" @entity2 's @entity270 in @entity112 , @entity271 in @entity54 and @entity272 in @entity39 contributed to this report			0
@entity2 's @entity274 and @entity275 , and journalist @entity276 also contributed .			0
