@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 are chatting over beers on a hot , humid wednesday night at @entity6 , a @entity0 , @entity1 , bar and restaurant , and a common pit stop for nearby factory workers			1
both these clean - cut men sitting at the bar in polo - style shirts have a lot in common			0
they work at the nearby @entity15 steel company			0
and they both have strong opinions about who the next president should be			0
but their politics are as different as their taste in beer			0
" i 'm not for @entity26 , i 'm not for his immigration policies , i do n't particularly agree with 100 % of his economic policies , " @entity3 said			0
for the record , he 's a @entity32 guy -- and a @entity34 supporter			2
" we ca n't go further into debt , and @entity37 is putting us further and further into debt by all these stimulus plans			1
" @entity40 , a @entity41 guy , supports president @entity37			1
if it were n't for the @entity37 - backed health care law , @entity40 said his friend 's unemployed son ( a recent college graduate ) would n't have health insurance coverage			1
@entity2 poll : health care ruling has not impacted race for @entity50 , so far when it comes to the economy , @entity40 admits it 's taking too long to recover from the recession			2
but he said that " going back to the policies that got us into this mess is not the direction we want to go			0
" @entity15 supplies steel to the big three automakers -- @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 -- so @entity40 's and @entity3 's jobs are tied to the auto industry			2
both agree on one thing : the $ 80 billion federal bailout of the auto industry was good for their jobs			1
still , @entity3 looks at it through broader lens			0
at one point he said , " the other side of me says you do n't bail out a company that 's going bankrupt			0
" these two friends epitomize what we found when hitting the road in the @entity81			1
@entity2 took the pulse of voters in auto towns in @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity1 and @entity87 -- important states that could make or break @entity89 for @entity37 and @entity34			1
in 2008 , @entity37 captured all four states			1
but this year @entity86 is leaning toward @entity34 -- and @entity87 is a tossup			1
in the 12 elections between 1964 and 2008 no presidential candidate has won without winning @entity87			2
this year @entity87 has about 30,000 fewer auto manufacturing jobs than it did in 2007			1
@entity1 has 50,000 fewer automaking jobs			1
on the bright side , @entity1 and @entity87 , respectively , have seen the nation 's biggest percentage declines in unemployment over the past two years			1
make no mistake , these four states hold keys to the @entity50 because all together they have 55 of 270 electoral votes needed to win			0
as @entity37 makes a second journey down the campaign trail , he 's touting the bailout of @entity62 and @entity63 -- and you can bet he 'll continue to do so			1
@entity34 , the presumptive @entity108 presidential nominee , opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed , managed bankruptcy of the two automakers			2
watch : politics in a former @entity62 town during a stop at the @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity86 , a lot of folks with auto industry ties wanted to talk politics , including @entity121 and his friend @entity122			2
just like in @entity1 -- these two auto - industry friends are not supporting the same candidate			1
@entity122 does n't think the president deserves another four years			2
" @entity34 , i like his economical experience and his business experience , and i think that would help get our country job growth and help us get back on our feet , " said @entity122 , a retired @entity63 millwright			2
@entity121 , an electrician at one of four @entity63 plants , counters , " @entity34 might be able to create jobs , but they 're gon na pay $ 7 or $ 8 an hour and you know ... i ca n't support my family on $ 7 or $ 8 with no benefits			1
numbers do n't mean anything in the creation of jobs if they 're not quality jobs			2
" as a member of the autoworkers ' union that traditionally skews @entity151 , @entity122 said he feels like his support for @entity34 puts him in the minority			2
but other union autoworkers spoke out who take issue with @entity37 's economic policies -- particularly the auto bailout -- and are throwing their support behind @entity34			1
among them are @entity160 , who has worked at a @entity61 factory in @entity162 , @entity1 , for 16 years			2
in @entity160 's view , @entity37 should n't have bailed out the industry			1
his company , @entity61 , did not take a bailout			0
" what i object to is all of the taxpayer dollars that were used , " @entity160 said			0
" i think markets need to be allowed to work			0
and there were some fundamental problems that @entity62 and @entity63 had that really were of their own making			0
" just a few miles away from @entity160 , electrician @entity173 stood in blistering 95 - degree heat across the street from the @entity63 plant where she had just finished a long day 's work			0
after being laid off from @entity63 in 2008 and out of work for 17 months , she said she was rehired one month after the auto bailout			0
@entity2 poll : economic optimism jumping " the @entity182 support the entire state of @entity1 , " @entity173 said			1
" the auto loans did n't just help @entity63 and @entity62 ; the auto loan also helped all of our suppliers			0
it helped all the small businesses in the areas			0
" throughout this road trip in every town we visited -- large or small -- autoworkers expressed countless combinations of opinions about the state of the economy and the political direction of the nation			1
come november , after all the stump speeches across the @entity81 are said and done , many of these folks will cast their votes , hoping their candidate will take the nation 's highest office			0
some will get their way -- and others wo n't			1
no doubt it will be fascinating to watch			0
