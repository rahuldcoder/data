-- an uproar over treatment delays at the @entity3 is triggering a heated debate over whether it is too difficult to fire federal workers , with the @entity8 approving legislation on wednesday that would make it easier to remove senior executives at the agency			1
the @entity12 , sponsored by @entity14 chairman @entity13 , @entity15 , and passed overwhelmingly , would let the agency secretary immediately fire any of the department 's senior executives			1
currently , those executives get at least 30 days ' notice of potential dismissal and an option to invoke a potentially lengthy appeals process before losing their jobs			2
for months , @entity13 has argued that the @entity3 is too reluctant to fire executives , especially those connected to delays in veterans care			1
the agency is engulfed by a growing controversy over allegations it covered up excessive wait times for veterans at some @entity3 health care facilities			1
president @entity36 is resisting calls from some quarters to fire @entity3 secretary @entity39			1
he said on wednesday that he needed more time to review what was going on and promised accountability			2
how many has the va fired ? an argument for change @entity13 's proposal is a strong statement , but it would affect a relatively small group of federal workers			1
there are roughly 360 senior executives at @entity3 , according to the @entity50			1
there are 340,000 total employees			2
but the more important figure to look at may be the number of execs fired recently			0
@entity0 analysis of @entity50 data found the @entity3 fired two senior executives last year			1
and that was much higher than usual			0
during the four years from 2008 - 2012 , only one other senior executive was terminated for cause from the agency , according to the personnel data			2
the @entity3 's executive firing rate last year was in line with the 0.47 % termination - for - cause rate of the federal government overall , according to the @entity50 statistics			1
but , the trend over the past five years shows a substantial difference at the @entity3			1
from 2008 - 2013 , the @entity3 fired executives at a rate one - fourth the firing rate for government overall , according to the @entity50 data			1
and even last year , when the @entity3 was in line with the rest of the federal government on firing , critics still see that as a significant problem because the rates of termination in the federal government are substantially lower than in the private sector			1
the 0.47 % federal rate is roughly a third of that for the private sector , according to the latest @entity90 data			0
" i actually think the federal workforce would be better off with more firing or at least as much as in the private sector , " argued @entity91 of the libertarian @entity92			0
" the good workers get disheartened and demoralized if they see these non-performing workers making as much as them and they 're not doing their job			0
" the danger of politics , an argument for workers but just as some conservatives cry for removing red tape and speeding up the firing process for government executives , others insist the idea could easily harm good employees at the @entity3			1
" what happens is the politics get ahead of the facts , " said @entity110 , an attorney who has worked on federal workers ' cases for more than 30 years			0
@entity116 believes the need for potential scapegoats in a crisis could easily lead to abuse under @entity13 's bill			1
for example , he told the story of an @entity124 employee who came to his office saying others at the agency had suggested she could be fired and were pressuring her to over a recent high - profile congressional investigation of @entity124 targeting of conservative political groups			2
@entity116 looked at her case , saw no evidence of wrong doing and advised her to stay put			0
she did , and was not fired			0
" for political reasons , things can get blown out of proportion easily , " @entity116 concluded			0
" and is it good that private employers can fire people without any cause ? we should want the federal government to be a model employer			1
" others argue something more : that allowing a political appointee , like a @entity151 secretary , to fire people at will could threaten @entity154 - style democracy			2
that it could invite patronage and corruption , something that was in full bloom until president @entity160 signed the first civil service reform act in 1883			2
" it 's really important in a political system to maintain a third party review of personnel actions , " said @entity162 , president of the nonpartisan @entity163 which focuses on strengthening civil service			2
" the operations of government need to be different in some ways than they are in the private sector			0
we do n't want a government that is staffed according to political persuasion , " he said			0
@entity178 believes the system needs to change , that there may be too much red tape			0
but he argues that @entity183 needs to revamp the entire , outdated federal personnel policy for the government , not just make a sudden change at the @entity3			1
" it 's the whole system that needs to be reviewed , " he asserted			0
why the change at the @entity3 ? why now ? @entity13 insists that as it is now , the @entity3 is not a meritocracy			1
that instead , poor performers who oversee failing areas , may be rewarded with bonuses			0
" in instance after instance where mismanagement has led to veteran suffering , department officials have repeatedly pointed to non-disciplinary actions such as employee retirements and transfers or bureaucratic slaps on the wrist , " said @entity13 when he introduced his bill in march			1
he called those actions " a disingenuous attempt to create the appearance of accountability			0
" secretary wo n't quit @entity39 has not publicly commented on whether he would like more power to fire executives			1
now that the @entity8 has acted , the matter moves over to the @entity211 where @entity213 's @entity212 has introduced a companion bill			1
it 's not clear if it will be considered			0
but for now , @entity39 has no plans to fire himself , saying he is n't resigning			2
nor has he said if he is in the process of firing any va employees as a result of the scandal			0
some , including the head of the @entity224 branch where problems were first discovered , have been suspended			0
did he say anything in his testimony why he could n't ? senators asked the agency leader directly at a hearing last week on the scandal			2
" have you ever fired anyone on this issue ? " sen. @entity235 , @entity236 , questioned @entity39			0
@entity39 replied that he needed to look through the agencies records to check			0
but would he fire someone because of the scandal ? " i will do everything i can , " @entity39 demurred			2
" that 's not the question , " replied @entity235			0
" there is a process here , " @entity39 summarize , " let me not get out ahead of it			0
" @entity36 management style under fire again with @entity3			1

new : @entity8 approves a bill that would make it easier to remove executives at @entity3
rep. @entity13 says the @entity3 is too reluctant to fire executives at center of care controversy
president @entity36 promises to get to the bottom of it and hold people accountable
the agency is under fire for treatment delays and allegations of a coverup
