@entity0 -- acknowledging the toll the unrelenting nuclear crisis has had on people 's lives and livelihoods , the owner of @entity4 's stricken nuclear plant has offered money to some of those in the radiation 's reach -- an offer that one city decided to refuse			1
an official with @entity17 , which operates the @entity19 power plant , said tuesday that the utility made a " token " offer to residents in 10 communities near the plant			1
nuclear crisis explainer starting march 31 , money began going out to those in nine of them			0
but the town of @entity31 rejected @entity17 's offer , with a local official calling it too meager an attempt to make up for a drastically reduced quality of life and income			1
" our people are suffering , and unfortunately , everything we 've built is gone , " mayor @entity39 told @entity1			1
" where is our direct apology ? " @entity39 asked			0
" because the cash certainly does n't amount to much			0
" @entity17 says the amount is an initial token payment , not compensation for losses sustained as a result of the nuclear accident at @entity19			1
they promise that will come later -- after they have assessed the damage from the accident , which has spread radioactive contamination across much of the surrounding area			0
the company called the initial offer " payment for their troubles , " and would not detail how much money is being offered to each community			1
but @entity65 , who is the manager of general affairs for @entity31 , said that it was 20 million yen -- about $ 12 for each of @entity31 's roughly 20,000 residents			1
that amount of cash , said @entity65 , is " not enough			0
" and it is logistically difficult to force local governments to distribute the money , which he said should be @entity17 's responsibility			1
several officials from @entity19 , the prefecture that includes the crippled plant , took their complaints about the company and the evacuation zone to prime minister @entity83 's @entity0 office tuesday afternoon			1
" we do n't know if @entity17 understands what we 're going through , " said @entity84 , the mayor of @entity85 , one of the towns that has been evacuated since the accident			1

one week ago , a report from @entity99 estimated @entity17 will face compensation claims of 1 trillion @entity4 yen ( about $ 12.13 billion ) if the recovery effort takes two months , the financial company 's @entity0 spokesman @entity96 told @entity1			1
that figure would rise to 2.4 trillion to 3 trillion yen if the process takes six months , and up to 10 trillion yen if the recovery takes two years , according to the report			2
most likely , tens of thousands of people will have a legitimate claim to this cash			0
they 'll include those who have n't been able to work , who have been forced out of their homes or who otherwise have had their lives turned upside down in the problem - plagued , complicated struggle to contain the emission of radiation into the air , ground and water from the @entity19 plant			0
how to help the government ordered about 78,000 people who lived within 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) of the plant to evacuate , due to high air and ground radiation readings in those locales			1
another 62,000 lived within 20 to 30 kilometers ( 12 to 19 miles ) -- the so - called exclusion zone , where people have been told to stay indoors -- an official from @entity83 's office said			2
@entity31 is located just outside this 30 - kilometer radius			2
interactive map thousands of others have been affected by the crisis			0
they include fishermen , who have been told not to go within 20 kilometers of the plant and are facing consumers skeptical about the safety of local seafood , especially after authorities announced plans to dump 11,500 tons of radioactive water into the @entity145			2
farmers , too , have been hit hard by restrictions on the sale and distribution of certain crops because of radiation readings exceeding government limits			0
@entity17 itself has suffered as well			2
the company has admitted it 's been inundated by 40,000 public complaints daily coming into its offices , its stock has plummeted and its faced several protests , including one sunday in downtown @entity0 that drew about 250 people			0
last week , chairman @entity162 acknowledged the financial difficulties and reports that @entity4 's government is considering nationalizing the company			0
" ( but ) we want to make every effort to stay a private company , " he said .			0
