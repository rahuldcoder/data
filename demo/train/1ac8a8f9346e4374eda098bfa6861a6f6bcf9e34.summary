-- think back to that prehistoric era before the internet existed			0
around this time every year the dreadful reality of @entity5 shopping would dawn : you would soon have no choice but to face the music and that music would be none other than a hypnotic rendition of @entity12 following you into every store , turning you into yet another mall zombie like the rest of them			2
today , with the modern miracle that is e-commerce , most of us buy many of our gifts via computer without a single festive melody or human interaction			0
it may be a welcome modernization for consumers , but does it take a little magic out of the whole experience ? now , with an innovative new hybrid shopping concept , we 'll be able to enjoy aspects of both worlds			2
this season sees the advent of ' digital storefronts ' , giant touchscreen store windows where customers can browse through a retailer 's items with a single swipe			1
once they find something they can hit the ' order ' button and a link will be sent to their mobile phone , allowing them to pay through @entity49 or with a credit or debit card			2
" ( it ) brings the best of online and new technologies to the physical world , " says @entity52 , vice president of innovation and new ventures at @entity55 , who have recently partnered with retail experience firm @entity56 to launch a series of digital storefronts at the @entity58			1
retailers @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 have all set up ' @entity67 ' points in the mall , which provide customers with a virtual shop within a real mall			0
of the three , only @entity63 has a physical outlet there			0
" the @entity74 in @entity58 are a great alternative to empty spaces in the mall			1
the opportunity is for brands to expand their footprint by offering vertical shopping experiences			0
connected glass does n't require a square footage retail space			0
therefore , it allows retailers to have a presence in areas with heavy foot traffic , where a square footage retail space would n't be possible or affordable , " said @entity52			0
of course , with digital storefronts you still have to make the time to visit , but once you do you get all the benefits of quick browsing and purchasing that are often lacking in a traditional store			1
this way , shoppers can scroll through goods and have them sent to a pick - up point or delivered to their door , mostly with free delivery and in some cases on the same day			1
@entity105 design outfit @entity103 also recently collaborated with the online retailer , to connect their digital storefront to an option similar to @entity55 's same day delivery service , @entity110 , which delivers items in about an hour from the time of purchase			1
the company 's ' connected glass ' technology could be widely installed on unused surfaces in the future , particularly in busy airports and train stations			0
monday this week was ' @entity120 , ' normally @entity55 's busiest sales day of the year .			1
