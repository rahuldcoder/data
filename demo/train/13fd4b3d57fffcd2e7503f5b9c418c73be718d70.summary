@entity0 , @entity1 -- ex-pakistani president @entity3 acknowledged his government secretly signed off on @entity6 drone strikes , the first time a top past or present @entity1 official has admitted publicly to such a deal			1
@entity1 leaders long have openly challenged the drone program and insisted they had no part in it			2
@entity3 's admission , though , suggests he and others did play some role , even if they did n't oversee the program or approve every attack			2
in an interview this week in @entity0 , @entity3 insisted @entity1 's government signed off on strikes " only on a few occasions , when a target was absolutely isolated and no chance of collateral damage			1
" still , his admission that @entity1 leaders agreed to even a limited number of strikes runs counter to their repeated denunciations of a program they long claimed the @entity6 was operating without their approval			1
the drone strikes -- which the nonpartisan public policy group @entity34 estimates have killed at least 1,990 people in @entity1 , including hundreds of civilians -- are unpopular in @entity1			1
" today , the world superpower is having its own way , without any consent from @entity1 , " former interior minister @entity38 said last month			0
despite such pronouncements , there 's been speculation that the story might have been different behind the scenes			0
in a cable sent in august 2008 and later posted online by @entity48 , then - @entity6 ambassador to @entity1 @entity50 mentioned a discussion about drones during a meeting that also involved @entity38 and then - prime minister @entity54			2
" @entity38 suggested we hold off alleged predator attacks until after the @entity59 operation , " @entity55 wrote			0
" the @entity3 brushed aside @entity38 's remarks and said , ' i do n't care if they do it as long as they get the right people			2
we 'll protest in the @entity66 and then ignore it			0
' " unmanned @entity6 drones began launching attacks in @entity1 in 2004 , by which time @entity3 had been president for five years after taking power in a bloodless coup			1
he said that @entity1 leaders would ok @entity6 drone strikes after discussions involving military and intelligence units and only if " there was no time for our own ... military to act			1
" this happened " only rarely , " said @entity3 , who left office in 2008 and spent years in exile before returning to @entity1 last month to launch a political comeback			0
but sometimes , he said , " you could n't delay action			0
" " these ups and downs kept going , " he said			0
" it was a very fluid situation , a vicious enemy , ... mountains , inaccessible areas			0
" @entity3 said that one of those killed by @entity6 drones was @entity93 , a tribal leader accused of harboring @entity95 militants in @entity1 's western border region			1
at the time , in june 2004 , @entity1 intelligence sources said @entity93 died after @entity1 forces launched a missile at a house where he was staying			0
anti-drone bill advances in @entity102 drones -- by the numbers @entity1 military battles militants near border with @entity108 @entity2 's @entity109 reported this story from @entity1 , and @entity111 wrote it in @entity112 .			1

first on @entity2 : @entity3 says @entity1 ok *'d* @entity6 drone strikes " on a few occasions "
he says sometimes " you could n't delay , " noting the " enemy " could be *elusive* and " vicious "
@entity1 officials have long *condemned* @entity6 drone strikes and denied any role in them
a drone killed @entity126 , @entity3 says ; @entity1 had *credited* its military
