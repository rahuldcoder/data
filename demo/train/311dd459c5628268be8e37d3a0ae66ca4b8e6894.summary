@entity0 -- as soon as @entity3 touched down in @entity4 on friday , gov. @entity2 met president @entity5 on the tarmac with a plea : expand the state 's access to government - sponsored health insurance			1
the catch : @entity2 wants to do it with a conservative twist			0
at least , that 's how he 's selling his proposal			0
and his political future could hinge on whether the first - term @entity17 can convince conservatives that he 's not just rebranding @entity20			1
@entity2 has spent much of his first two years in office trying to strike a bargain on one of the health care law 's core components			2
@entity4 will expand @entity27 coverage , @entity2 says , but only if it 's allowed to do it through a tweaked version called the " @entity29 , " which also requires users to make small payments into health savings accounts			1
he spent five minutes chatting with @entity5 at the @entity34 airport , lobbying to have the @entity35 green - light @entity4 's request , before the president visited a factory in @entity40 , @entity4			1
" the president and i talked through a number of substantive issues that have arisen in our discussions over the @entity29 , " @entity2 said afterward , " and i appreciated the opportunity to call the matter to his personal attention			0
" he said he also spoke last night with top @entity5 adviser @entity50 , and will meet monday with @entity52 secretary @entity51			0
@entity2 's focus on a health care expansion is at the center of his effort to evolve from a firebrand conservative congressman to an executive with a record of accomplishment ahead of a @entity62 run that many @entity17 close to him see as a question of when -- not if			1
as he flirts with a 2016 bid , @entity2 could be the best test of whether a conservative can run nationally after expanding a government - sponsored health system			2
@entity69 faced hurdles with conservatives during his 2012 presidential bid , in part because of the health care system he put in place when he was the governor of @entity76			0
other governors who could seek the 2016 @entity17 nomination -- including @entity80 's @entity79 and @entity82 's @entity81 -- have accepted @entity20 's extension of @entity27 coverage to hundreds of thousands of their state 's residents			1
but @entity2 has taken an important extra step			0
he 's arguing that @entity4 's proposal is the solution to @entity27 's woes			1
he called @entity4 's plan " a better and more effective alternative " to traditional @entity27 in a letter to @entity5 on thursday			1
the @entity29 's key departure from traditional @entity27 is that users are required to contribute small amounts of their own money to personal health savings accounts			1
the program was developed under former gov. @entity99 and initially served about 40,000 adults under a @entity27 waiver that @entity52 granted before @entity20 's existence			2
after @entity2 was elected in 2012 , he said a slightly updated version called the " @entity104 " is the only vehicle he 'd consider for expanding coverage			0
" since its inception , the @entity29 has empowered its members to take greater personal ownership over their health care decisions and become more cost - conscious consumers of health care services , " @entity2 wrote to @entity5 on thursday			2
but some conservatives say @entity4 's changes to @entity27 are just " window dressing			1
" " it seems like he 's just sort of taken the moniker of health savings accounts and applied it to this brand new entitlement in hoping that this window dressing will make it conservative , " said @entity116 , the research director for the @entity117 , which has set up a website -- @entity125 -- blasting @entity2 's handling of the issue			1
even @entity2 's usually - reliable allies have been critical			0
@entity129 , @entity131 's @entity4 state director , called it a " troubling deviation from the solid , free - market approach @entity138 has taken on most other matters , " and said he hopes @entity2 is firm with @entity5 to keep from giving " any ground which would result in @entity135 taxpayers paying even more			1
" the criticism comes as @entity2 is increasingly hyped as a prospective nominee who both the @entity17 's base and its business wing could find acceptable			2
a 2016 run is no lock , and @entity2 has said he 'll make a decision about his future next year -- likely after the @entity4 legislature wraps up its budget - writing session in april			2
but he 's been testing the waters			0
@entity2 visited @entity151 last month and will campaign in @entity152 for gov. @entity153 on oct. 24			0
he critiqued @entity5 's handling of foreign policy during a trip to @entity157 over the summer			0
and two of his former top aides , @entity158 and @entity160 , now work within the network of conservative funding giants @entity163 and @entity164 -- a sign that @entity2 would have the financial backing for a national run			0
@entity116 said his group polled three early primary states -- @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity170 -- in august , and found that 70 percent of likely @entity17 primary voters said they would n't support a candidate who had expanded @entity27			0
" the idea that a @entity17 governor can come in and implement @entity20 and then run for president unscathed -- it seems a little ridiculous , " he said .			2

@entity2 urged president @entity5 to ok @entity4 's proposal to expand health coverage
@entity2 says @entity4 's plan is a departure from traditional @entity27 because it includes health savings accounts
but conservatives are *accusing* @entity2 , a possible 2016 @entity17 presidential *contender* , of embracing @entity20
