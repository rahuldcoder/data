@entity0 , @entity1 -- first there was the blast , and then as sight as surreal as it was ghastly			1
dozens of children , naked bar their underwear , running barefoot into the village , peppered with blood , screaming			2
after three days agonizing , the siege to end the standoff at @entity14 @entity13 , in @entity0 , southern @entity1 , began with a huge explosion in the gym where dozens of militants had herded 1,200 children and parents			1
the explosives inside had been rigged up between two basketball hoops and the hostages lined the walls of the gym			2
one witness said the blast caused it to " rain meat " inside the gym			2
those who could , ran			2
they fled between houses , stripped of their clothes because of the scorching heat they had endured in the glass - windowed gym , where many were forced to drink urine to hydrate , towards a village that had been holding its breath for over 50 hours			1
the hostage crisis in @entity0 , and the bungled , reckless operation that the @entity1 military allowed to happen , was a defining moment in @entity45 's war in southern @entity1			1
@entity47 's use of blunt instruments to fix its increasingly @entity50 rebellion in the restless @entity51 , had blatantly not worked , despite two wars to end @entity54 separatism , and had instead created a new radicalized , implacable monster , capable of blowing children to pieces , perhaps under the justification they were , in @entity0 's region of @entity61 , @entity62			1
@entity64 horror there was remarkable bravery shown by @entity1 special forces during the rescue operation , just none from their political masters			1
the siege began , but no cordon was put in place , so the media and villagers could simply walk into the school 's yard , and even the school itself , unimpeded			1
i watched the @entity83 detachment of @entity1 spetznaz race past me , headlong into the school , unsupported and outgunned			1
they must have known they were running to their deaths , but sprinted all the same			2
i watched one of them brace himself against a door frame , before turning a corner to fire			2
body after body was brought out , most shipped away by locals in cars rushed in for the purpose -- there was no triage system , just brave emergency services workers , who also died rescuing children			2
one militant was dragged from the building , his trousers pulled from his waist			2
once the locals checked he was circumcised ( and therefore , by their logic , @entity111 , and hence a gunman ) , they beat him to a pulp and left his body in the back of a truck			2
i ran into the gym while the siege was still ongoing , and its floor was a black mush of unrecognizable horror			1
the fighting went on , into the night , as one militant held out			0
@entity45 , who had , when he came to power , pledged to shoot @entity54 militants in the toilet , and who had the steel will to order a partially lethal knockout gas and swift military operation to end the siege of a @entity47 theater two years earlier , was absent from @entity0			1
he slipped in the night of the violence , visiting the wounded			0
nobody wanted to be associated with @entity136 's mess			1
troubled @entity138 plagued by violence monument to the dead it is nearly a decade ago , but still the scenes retain a revolting clarity in my mind			0
amid the shrill noise of militant threats ahead of the @entity150 , the gym in @entity0 is now steeped in silence , a monument to the dead , untouched almost			1
the body parts that still lay there the day after the bloodshed are gone			1
the victims ' clothes that someone had hung from changing room pegs when i returned three months later -- they too are gone			1
there are some structural supports to keep the building up , but otherwise it is as if @entity0 the village has shielded the school from the passage of time , perhaps because @entity0 itself is still caught in the painful task of seeking answers			1
it is not only the amorphous puzzle to find a " why " -- the only surviving gunman 's father told me passively that @entity175 said , during the @entity1 civil war , there is " white and there is red , and there always will be " , but offered little other motivation			1
it is also their still unresolved bid to find out how negotiations failed and how such a bungled , bloody operation could ever have come to be			1
@entity186 was orphaned by the blast			0
three weeks later , he pointed at the school and matter - of - factly told me his mother and father had died in the school			1
three months later , he was at the center of a custody battle between his relatives , some suggesting the large compensation payout he was getting from the state , was fueling the competition			0
today , he is 16 and towers in the gym , where he was once physically sheltered by his mother as the bomb went off			0
he says his memory is patchy , and that the dreams that used to haunt him have ebbed			0
" i do n't really remember much " , he said			0
" mother and aunt covered me up			1
everybody started to run , but the terrorists tried to stop us			0
we thought it was the end			0
" he remembers how someone sitting next to him made a run for it , and he followed , and hid somewhere			0
then , in the carnage they had begun , an uncharacteristic sign of humanity came from one of the gunmen , he recalls			0
" one of the terrorists , i think it was , gave me food and water , then the emergency services came and took me to hospital in a car			0
" today , he enjoys basketball , and hopes to avoid conscription in the army			0
he lives with his aunt , after public pressure resolved the custody dispute			0
the school he studies in , with another 124 former hostages , is lined with memorials of the spetznaz and medics who gave their lives saving others			1
teachers say they these pupils have few problems -- bar instances of " dovleniye " , a @entity1 word directly translated as " pressure , " but used inaccurately to suggest depression or anxiety			1
in fact , the building marries a cheerfulness sustained relentlessly by the teachers , with the constant remembering of the dead , as if aimed at making the survivors sit happily with their past			0
little peace the mothers of @entity0 , however , know little peace			1
anger at the government bloomed after the siege			1
they felt abandoned in the immediate aftermath , before @entity47 poured millions into the town , and its now garish graveyard , as if to compensate for their absence when it was most needed			0
those feelings of anger turned into suspicion : endless investigations have not satisfied some who believe perhaps the government knew of the gunmen 's plan and did n't act , or even ordered the first shots fired to prevent them having to negotiate with the militants			2
@entity283 , whose children survived , retains those suspicions even a decade on			0
" they started it because they could not get out of this situation in any other way			0
they did n't want to negotiate			0
without @entity45 's order , that could n't have happened			2
" for others , the lack of answers simply amplifies inexhaustible grief			0
@entity298 lost her two daughters and lights two candles for them in the driving snow			0
she cries as she talks of how she has no idea what her daughter would have looked like if she lived til today			0
she says : @entity306 does n't heal at all			0

in 2004 , @entity54 rebels took 1,200 **people** hostage at a school in @entity0 , @entity1
*hundreds* of **people** were *killed* during the *subsequent* three - day siege and military operation
