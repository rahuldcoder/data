-- president @entity1 on wednesday will assume the delicate role of comforting a nation still in shock in the aftermath of the @entity7 shootings while also transcending the tragedy to move a grieving nation forward			1
as difficult and unique as the task may be , @entity1 needs to look no further than his role model @entity11 and his @entity13 predecessor @entity12 for a lesson in how to console the country			2
both presidents were praised for the leadership they showed in the aftermath of two domestic disasters -- the challenger explosion in 1986 and the @entity22 bombing in 1995			2
" this is @entity1 's @entity25 - @entity22 moment , " presidential historian @entity23 said			1
@entity11 and @entity12 each paid tribute to the victims , gave support to the survivors and struck a tone of healing , as @entity1 will likely do when he speaks at the memorial service at the @entity33 in @entity34			1
were you affected by the shootings ? share your memories , tributes the @entity39 has n't released details of what the president will say except that he will devote most of his remarks to memorializing the victims			2
a 9 - year - old girl , a federal judge and four others were killed in the weekend shooting			2
rep. @entity49 remains in critical condition after being shot in the head			0
" @entity1 's speech will be a vigil with rhetoric that does n't soar , but touches the heart , " @entity23 said			1
" we want him to be our empathizer - in - chief			2
he 's our representative at the memorial service for how we collectively feel			1
and that 's what powerful rhetoric from presidents can do			2
" @entity11 and @entity12 both delivered speeches that were brief yet poignant when they addressed a grieving public			0
@entity11 encouraged the country to find " the courage to look for the seeds of hope			0
" in the aftermath of a bombing that killed 168 people , @entity12 told mourners , " you have lost too much , but you have not lost everything			0
and you have certainly not lost @entity76 , for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes			0
" @entity23 calls @entity12 's memorial remarks " the finest speech " he ever gave			1
" if [ @entity1 ] can get anywhere near the perfect tone touched after @entity22 , the country will be deeply grateful to him , " he said			1
but whether @entity1 's speech serves as a pivotal unifying moment in his presidency depends on his ability to put the tragedy in a larger context , said @entity91 , a professor in the political science department at the @entity93			1
" typically the shelf life of presidential speeches is pretty short , " @entity91 said			0
" on the other hand , he is somebody who ran for office as someone who wanted to change the tone in @entity100 , so it certainly could galvanize his efforts with respect to that particular goal			0
" although there is no indication that the heated political atmosphere played a part in the shooter 's motive , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on their colleagues to tone it down			0
goodwill , however , evaporates quickly in politics			0
" to expect that this speech is going to change things is a pretty high expectation , " @entity91 noted			0
@entity120 , a @entity12 speech writer , said there is a need for the president to be heard in moments such as these			1
@entity120 worked with @entity12 on the remarks he gave in the aftermath of the massacre at @entity129 in 1999 , among other speeches			0
" you are stopping to reflect on this loss , what has been lost and then all you can do is suggest the possibility of moving on			0
we are a ways from that moment ... but you can suggest that possibility of transcending this moment and finding some sort of peace in your grief , " said @entity120 , founding partner of the speech writing and strategy firm @entity137			2
@entity1 began working on his speech monday night			1
the president is expected to speak at the memorial service at 6 p.m. local time			1
while the service is open to the campus and the @entity34 community , @entity1 's words will be heard by the nation			1
" he is speaking first and most immediately to the families who are grieving , he is speaking to the local community which is badly shaken , and of course he is speaking to the national audience because we are all caught up in this together , " @entity120 said			0
and no matter what approach he takes , the president can expect his words to be scrutinized			1
" it should not have the feel of politics to it at all , but there is no question that these are political moments , " @entity120 said .			0
