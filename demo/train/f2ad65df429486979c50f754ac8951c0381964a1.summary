friday , @entity3 's @entity11 will shut its doors for good			1
@entity15 was where @entity17 and @entity18 pilots touched down after the war when @entity21 blockaded @entity3			1
the allied pilots flew in millions of tons of food , fuel and medication for an ailing population , earning themselves the title " candy bombers , " for dropping candy as they flew over the city			1
" through @entity15 , we stayed alive , " said @entity32 , 83 , who lived near the airport in @entity3 after the war			2
without the air drops , she said , the people would have starved to death			2
the airport rapidly became @entity3 's only hub for supplies , eventually carrying almost 2.5 million tons of goods into the city			1
@entity15 's massive main building -- originally designed to represent @entity6 to visitors -- remains one of the largest structures in the world			1
the @entity48 later built a basketball court and firing range at @entity15 , and hid an entire command center in the vast network of tunnels under the buildings			2
these days , however , its runways are too short for most modern civilian aircraft			2
city officials said the airport was not profitable and needed to be shut down as @entity3 builds a major new airport , @entity3 - @entity60			2
moves to close @entity15 have sparked protests from residents and aviators who thought more should have been done to preserve such an important part of the city 's history			1
see archive photos of the airport " the people want it , private enterprise wants it , all national arguments are in favor of it , " @entity69 , a local opposition leader , said last year			2
more than 100 private pilots staged a " fly - in " in september 2007 to protest the plans			1
@entity32 said @entity79 were still angry with city officials who allowed the closure			0
she blamed business leaders for putting pressure on the city to close the airport by arguing it cost too much and did n't make enough money			1
" for business people , the airport does n't mean anything , " said @entity32			0
she said they were too young to remember how important @entity15 has been for the city			0
@entity32 is among many who believe the airport should be turned into a cultural memorial			0
a memorial already exists outside the airport to remember the candy bombers , dozens of whom died flying in during bad weather or after being harassed by @entity100 fighter planes			1
" the success of the airlift made sure that the communist ideology lost its impetus , lost its thrust , because people began to realize that democracies can defend their way of life , " said @entity101 of the @entity102			0
the allied pilots , @entity32 said , were responsible for saving the city amid the @entity115 blockade			1
" the @entity115 tried with all their might to break us , " she said			1
@entity32 snuck into @entity3 from the @entity119 after the war			0
that meant she did n't have a visa and could n't receive official food rations , so she literally scraped by during her night job at a bakery			2
@entity32 said she cleaned the pans and would try to scratch off whatever food remained stuck to the sides			2
her boss would check to make sure she was n't eating any of the remnants , but @entity32 said she did it anyway , whenever her boss was n't looking			0
@entity15 's beginnings date to september 4 , 1909 , when @entity17 aviation pioneer @entity135 flew an engine - powered plane for a few minutes on the airfield there			1
it ushered in the era of aviation in @entity6 , and @entity15 eventually became @entity3 's central airport and the biggest hub in @entity145			1
the airport also became the home of @entity148 , which was founded in @entity3 in 1926			0
civilian traffic declined during the second world war and the @entity151 occupied the airport			0
the @entity17 took it over in july 1945			1
the @entity100 blockade of @entity3 began in may 1948 as an attempt to force the @entity156 powers out of that part of the city			1
they cut off rail and road links to the @entity162 , and @entity3 -- isolated in the middle of the new @entity164 -- found itself isolated even more			0
in response , the @entity165 imposed counter-blockade measures which included cutting off @entity164 communications and an embargo on @entity171 exports			0
the moves forced the @entity100 to eventually lift the blockade a year later , in may 1949			1
the last flights from @entity15 will fly just before midnight thursday , the airport authority said			0
one will be a special @entity148 flight aboard a @entity177 , a @entity179 transport aircraft			0
the other will be a @entity181 -- the same type of plane flown by the candy bombers from @entity15 some 60 years ago			0
with the closing of @entity15 , the city has two remaining airports -- at @entity188 and @entity189			0
all flights from @entity15 will move to @entity189			0
eventually , @entity188 will become the new @entity191 , or @entity192			0
it is scheduled to open in 2011 , after which @entity189 will close			2
