@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has said it will press on with its nuclear program as a response to what it described as hostility from the @entity8 after an analysis of satellite images indicated increased activity at its nuclear test site			1
" we had access to nuclear deterrence for self - defense because of the hostile policy of the @entity8 to stifle the @entity3 by force and we will expand and bolster it nonstop as long as this hostile policy goes on , " an unidentified spokesman for the @entity3 @entity14 said in a report tuesday by the state - run @entity16			1
@entity3 is short for @entity3 , @entity3 's official name			1
the top @entity8 envoy for @entity3 , @entity27 , warned @entity28 on monday that a possible third nuclear test would be " a serious miscalculation and mistake			1
" the @entity3 official suggested tuesday that a nuclear test had not originally been part of the regime 's plans			2
" we did not envisage such a military measure as a nuclear test as we planned to launch a scientific and technical satellite for peaceful purposes , " he said			2
but the statement concluded with a vague threat : " if the @entity8 persists in its moves to ratchet up sanctions and pressure upon us despite our peace - loving efforts , we will be left with no option but to take counter-measures for self - defense			1
" @entity3 launched a rocket on april 13 , which failed less than two minutes into the flight			0
it said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit , but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology			0
the move torpedoed a deal reached in february under which @entity28 agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the @entity8			2
many analysts assume an atomic test by @entity3 is just a matter of time following the failure of the rocket launch last month			0
two previous rocket launches in 2006 and 2009 were followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests			0
and activity is being ramped up at @entity3 's nuclear test site , a sign that the country is preparing for a test , according to an analysis of new satellite images by the defense publication @entity81			1
mining carts and excavation equipment at @entity85 's tunneling area can be seen in satellite images taken by @entity87 and @entity88 in the past month			2
@entity89 and debris are being removed from the tunnel in the largest quantities seen so far , according to the @entity81 assessment			0
an image from mid-april shows a full mining train , including an engine and several carts , outside of the tunnel			0
and a more recent shot on may 9 reveals new road networks at the site along with carts and a vehicle at the facility			0
in the statement tuesday , @entity3 denounced as " absolutely intolerable " a declaration from the @entity107 leaders over the weekend , which stated that @entity28 faces more isolation if it continues its pursuit of a nuclear program			1
