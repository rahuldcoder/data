he is widowed and childless			2
in his introspection and erudition , he was something apart from the usual @entity2 detective , even in a culture that created @entity65 and @entity66			1
" @entity4 is probably the most intelligent officer in modern detective fiction , " @entity67 , no mean detective writer herself , told the @entity26 in 2001			1
@entity27 was following in the @entity2 mystery tradition even as she longed to tweak it , she told the @entity26			1
" if i was starting now , i would almost certainly have a woman professional police officer " as the main character , @entity27 said			1
" but when i began , in the late ' 50s , it was a very different world			2
women in the police force mostly dealt with issues concerning women and children			2
i do n't think they were even in the detective force , so i had no choice about sex			2
" the @entity4 mysteries include " @entity85 " ( 1975 ) , " @entity87 " ( 1986 ) and " @entity86 " ( 2001 )			1

" from an early age , i used to tell imaginative stories to my younger brother and sister			0
i lived in the world of the imagination , and i did something that other writers have told me they did as children : i described myself inwardly in the third person , " she said			0
" i do n't know whether this is significant , but i think writing was what i wanted to do -- almost as soon as i knew what a book was			0
" and her subject , she said , was a natural for her			0
as she told the @entity113 , " i had an interest in death from an early age			0
when i heard , @entity136 sat on a wall , i thought , did he fall , or was he pushed ? " ironically , her breakthrough work was a @entity140 title , 1980 's " @entity142 , " which allowed her to retire to writing full time			0
