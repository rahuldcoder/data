-- if the consequences at @entity6 airport had n't been so serious , the expressions on our faces would have made the perfect @entity8 moment			1
our jaws dropped , color drained from our faces , and we had that sick , sinking feeling familiar to those who 've locked their keys in the house			2
only this was a million times worse			2
@entity17 might be able to secure exclusives with the likes of @entity21 's president or put a man on the moon ( well it could if it put its mind to it )			1
but dealing with this situation ? it was unpredictable -- and very tricky			1
because of what 's easily described as a " communications breakdown " ( the check - in clerk did n't listen and wrongly tagged our bags to our final destination , @entity34 ) our camera gear and lights were now heading in the wrong direction			1
this left us to interview the chief executive of @entity41 manufacturing giant @entity40 with little more than an @entity43 's torch app for mood lighting			1
fortunately the gravity of the situation shocked the check - in agent so badly ( her face was priceless ) that she kindly chased after said luggage in the bowels of @entity53 airport with a screed of labels to correct the mistake			2
more @entity57 : @entity59 's substance over style as the bags arrived in @entity65 , the cameraman @entity61 and @entity62 , @entity63 's presenter , were relieved			1
a close shave , nothing worse			2
that is , until we opened our camera boxes and found our batteries had been confiscated and apparently destroyed by the authorities at @entity6 's airport			2
we were told they were potentially dangerous			0
luckily , we had our camera batteries and a charger so it was just a second close shave for us			0
the batteries were returned to our @entity41 bureau a day later			1
clearly , fate was n't happy about that happy ending			0
after our interview we returned to the airport to find our flight was canceled due to fog in @entity88 , eating into our precious edit time			2
we were put on an afternoon flight			0
that was wrecked by a bomb scare , leaving us to find a hotel for the night while the authorities took five hours to deal with abandoned luggage which had a metal pipe inside			1
more @entity57 : @entity97 fractures as recession fades i was ready to shake it at someone by now , as thousands of displaced passengers surged into the airport hotels and assaulted their power sockets with assorted laptop and phone chargers			0
we do n't still know what happened to the pipe			0
amid all the calamity , our cameraman was able to shoot some of the chaos and send it back to our newsdesk , thanks to the hotel 's broadband			1
had enough of this already ? it 's not over yet			2
when we returned the following day to join a rebooked flight , we found out that was canceled due to technical reasons			0
@entity123 were very apologetic but by now my cameraman @entity61 said he was ready to start eating people			0
more @entity57 : @entity97 feels winds of change there was a sense of utter helplessness and ridiculousness			0
our updates back to @entity134 were being treated with increasing incredulity			0
eventually , happily , the @entity41 came to the rescue			1
we were rebooked on a @entity138 flight which was due to leave in what felt like two minutes , but was actually 20 minutes			0
we needed to clear security , which had the longest queue in the world			0
this was n't the @entity41 i know -- where was the predictable efficiency ? we got back to @entity88 intact , and the edit took place			1
i hope we 'll be reunited with our bags , all 14 of them , eventually			0
what have i learned from this experience ? expect the unexpected when it comes to air travel .			1

@entity0 's @entity156 team was on the road in @entity41 when they got caught in chaos
@entity0 pulls off exclusive interviews -- but sometimes travel *hiccups* makes life very unpredictable
the team 's travel plans went utterly awry amid a bomb scare , fog and baggage *problems*
@entity63 *producer* @entity170 says he 's learned one thing : expect the unexpected
