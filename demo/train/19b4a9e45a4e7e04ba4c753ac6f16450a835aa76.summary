-- for many , " e.t. : the @entity7 " remains @entity3 's most indelible film , holding a special spot in moviegoers ' hearts			2
( i know it does for me			0
) but when the movie was re-released in theaters in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary , @entity3 tried to fix something that was not broken and " updated " the movie 's visual effects			2
he gave @entity17 's face a @entity19 makeover , added back in a couple deleted scenes , and -- most controversially -- switched out the rifles held by police officers chasing down @entity24 and his bicycle buddies with walkie - talkies			1
" @entity29 " mocked the decision			0
last year , @entity3 himself even admitted he regretted making the changes , vowing that the @entity32 would just be the 1982 theatrical version of the film			1
and by gum , it 's exactly that			0
as you 'll see in the trailer for the 30th - anniversary blu - ray edition of the film , out this october , those walkie - talkies are no more			1
while the blu - ray wo n't have walkie - talkies , it will have two new bonus featurettes , one chronicling the day - to - day events of making the movie , the other a new interview with @entity3 reminiscing about the movie			1
those two deleted scenes will be available separately from the cut of the film , and many of the bonus features from the previous @entity57 release of " @entity7 " will be available on the blu - ray as well			2
