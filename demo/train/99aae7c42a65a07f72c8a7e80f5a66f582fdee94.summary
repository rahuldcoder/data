@entity0 -- documents set to be released this week by the @entity4 watchdog show that the agency targeted tea party organizations and other groups focused on government spending and the federal debt that were seeking tax - exempt status			1
@entity11 : alleged @entity4 political targeting ' outrageous ' first hearings on @entity4 targeting set for friday the @entity4 also applied extra scrutiny to applicants with statements that " criticize how the country is run " or that sought to educate the public on how to " make @entity20 a better place to live , " designations that would have included conservative political groups looking to apply for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status			2
timeline : @entity4 wrestled with which groups to scrutinize those disclosures are included in the appendix of an inspector general 's report , obtained by @entity1 , that has caused widespread anger among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as conservative groups			0
bipartisan outrage over @entity4 targeting so , what 's a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) ? a " 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) " organization is tax - exempt under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the tax code if it meets two criteria : the " organization must not be organized for profit and must be operated exclusively to promote social welfare			1
" to meet the @entity4 social welfare requirements , " an organization must operate primarily to further the common good and general welfare of the people of the community , " the @entity4 further defines this critical criterion under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) as " primarily for the purpose of bringing about civic betterment and social improvements			2
" but the @entity4 has said that " the promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office			0
" that said , " a section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) social welfare organization may engage in some political activities , so long as that is not its primary activity			2
" and , according to the @entity4 , a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) may also engage in lobbying			0
for example , guidance from the @entity4 available online suggests that an organization is likely to be deemed tax - exempt under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) if its educational activities are conducted in a non-partisan manner and if the organization is not affiliated with a political party -- even though the organization 's philosophy on the issues it is providing education about is broadly consistent with the view of a major political party			1
the same guidance also points to past rulings by the @entity4 that allowed tax - exempt status under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) for " organizations primarily engaged in advocating a particular point of view on an issue of public concern , through lobbying and public education			1
" the same guidance points out that an organization exempt under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) " may engage in political campaign activities if those activities are not the organization 's primary activity			0
" @entity101 : what 's behind the @entity4 tea party scrutiny flap			0
