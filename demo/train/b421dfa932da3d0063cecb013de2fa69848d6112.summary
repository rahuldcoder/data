what connects @entity4 enthusiasts in @entity5 busy translating the social networking site into @entity7 and a community of orthopaedic surgeons swapping ideas on how to treat spinal injuries ? @entity4 has called on its network of users to create new innovations to the site			2
they 're both examples of a worldwide phenomenon that is changing the way people -- and ultimately businesses -- develop ideas			2
@entity24 ( @entity25 ) are online communities of like - minded people working together to create innovations			1
author and scientist @entity29 originated the term			1
he describes it as a " cyberteam of self - motivated people with a collective vision			1
" these cyberteams are cropping up everywhere , unified not only by their " collective vision " but by the giant tentacles of the @entity38			0
in the case of @entity4 , they are the @entity5 users of the site who are helping to translate it into their native language			0
elsewhere , they are the surgeons collaborating on @entity46 , an online community where experts from around the world can exchange ideas for innovations in the treatment of spinal injuries			1
the potential of all this pooling of ideas is enormous , says @entity29			1
if you 're not convinced , he says , take a look at what @entity25 have already accomplished -- the creation of the @entity61 itself is the most obvious example			1
" it was developed by a network of people based all over the world working as a @entity25 , " says @entity29 , who ought to know since he was there for part of its inception			1
@entity29 was as a researcher at the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) in @entity74 15 years ago at the same time as @entity76 scientist @entity75 -- the man credited with inventing the @entity61			1
@entity75 had come over to the @entity77 from @entity78 , the @entity79 in @entity80 where the @entity61 had first launched three years earlier			1
" i had the benefit of watching him work close up for a few months , and i saw that his real genius lay in his ability to co-ordinate and incorporate the ideas of all these hundreds of other people based around the world			2
" since then @entity25 have helped create much of our online landscape			1
the web - based encyclopaedia @entity92 and the internet browser @entity94 are just two of the products whose development relies upon the contribution of a community of online users			1
@entity29 says : " i have a saying : ' do n't be a star , be a galaxy			1
' if you embed yourself in a galaxy you can go so much further			0
" @entity106 , who is from @entity80 , is not simply a delighted observer of the phenomenon			0
he was part of the network that helped develop hypertext -- online text that links to other text , like this			2
he worked with a hardcore of around 100 people worldwide , most of whom he never met and who worked on the project in their own time , and for little or no reward			0
" most of the innovation that you see on the @entity38 today was given away for nothing , " he says			0
" people did it for the sheer love of it			0
" this fraternal , almost unworldly attitude is a common feature of many @entity25			1
for the network to be successful , contributors have to operate transparently and be willing to share their knowledge			0
this philanthropic , non-hierarchical approach to innovation sounds radical in an era when the theft of ideas by unscrupulous corporations is well documented			0
however , @entity29 says the concept has a strong historical precedent in the ' @entity144 ' organization set up in @entity145 by @entity146 in the 18th century			1
one of the @entity147 and a scientist by profession , @entity146 set up the club for mutual improvement to allow people from diverse backgrounds to share knowledge and propose ideas			1
of course the idea of working collaboratively to create innovations is not new			0
taking just one example , the development of much of modern physics ( from quantum theory to the creation of the atom bomb ) owes its success to teamwork			0
the @entity167 , for example , employed more than 130,000 people at over thirty different sites across @entity170 and @entity171			0
even so , it is an approach that the business world has found hard to come to terms with			2
@entity29 says the rigid structure of many big corporations makes this free exchange of ideas difficult to achieve			1
" in order to gain control , one has to give up control			0
but the one thing managers do n't like doing is giving up control			0
" a case in point is the failure of @entity188 to take advantage of the myriad of innovations produced at the company 's research facility in the 1970s and early 1980s			1
the r&d centre known as @entity195 and located in @entity196 , @entity197 , was responsible for inventing laser printing and the @entity199 , and for pioneering the use of the computer mouse			0
@entity188 executives failed to grasp the potential of many of @entity195 's inventions and it was left to other firms to develop them fully , and enjoy the profits			2
not all firms have been quite so sluggish			0
@entity209 , the world 's biggest maker of household goods , made a commitment in 2001 to source half of all new innovations from outside of the company			2
it set up ' connect + develop ' , an initiative that allows people to submit new innovations online			2
the venture has been so successful that @entity209 now gets 42 percent of all its new technologies from outside sources			0
as a medium for exchanging ideas , the @entity38 seems almost without peer			0
@entity228 , managing director of the social networking site @entity230 , says the collaborative potential of the @entity61 has yet to be fully realized , however			1
" if web 2.0 was about sharing collective knowledge or publication , then collective action -- making decisions en masse -- will typify @entity238 , " he says			2

@entity24 ( @entity25 ) are online communities of innovators
the @entity61 and @entity92 were both developed by @entity25
author @entity29 says business needs to take notice of web - based innovators
@entity146 's club for mutual improvement is an early example of a coin
