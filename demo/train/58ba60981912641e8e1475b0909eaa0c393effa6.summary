-- " 127 hours " is n't just the name of @entity4 's @entity3 - nominated film , it also could describe the length of time he waits before delving into a new career			1
musical producer ; college lecturer , bar owner ; @entity14 greeter -- which of these titles wo n't @entity4 be adding to his résumé in the coming months ? if you guessed @entity14 greeter , you 're right -- for now			1
" i 'm doing it because i love it , " the star has said of juggling so many jobs			2
" why not do as many things i love as i can ? as long as the work is good			2
" considering all the occupations he holds , it 's tempting to blame @entity4 for the country 's unemployment problem			1
he 's absolutely everywhere these days , and just about the only place you wo n't see the 32 - year - old @entity3 nominee / host 's squinty , smirking face is on a milk carton			1
yet , as true @entity38 know , it was n't always this way			2
after gaining attention in the 1999 - 2000 tv series " @entity42 , " @entity4 embarked on a career as a " serious actor			1
" he shunned the limelight , nabbed a @entity46 for the " @entity48 " tv movie , appeared with @entity49 in " @entity50 " and headlined a string of little - seen dramas , including " @entity53 " and " @entity54			1
" " it was death , " he has said of his career path at the time			2
" i did n't want to act anymore			2
it was death doing the things i was supposed to be doing			0
i could n't make those movies anymore			0
... i had the conversation with my manager like , ' if this is what it 's gon na be , i ca n't do this anymore			0
' so , it was n't like the answer was , ' hey ! go do a bunch of crazy stuff ! ' i had to figure out how to change what i was doing			0
i had to figure out that i had to believe in my own taste			0
not believe in what you should do			0
believe in what i liked and it 's ok			0
" apparently , those likes included books , bongs and bedpans : @entity4 went back to college , made the 2008 stoner comedy , " @entity85 , " and took a role on " @entity87 " as serial killer @entity4			1
the soap - opera gig was an unheard move for a successful film actor -- seriously , can you picture @entity91 doing " @entity92 " ? -- but by 2010 , you 'd be hard - pressed to define @entity4 as a film actor anyway : he was modeling in a wet t - shirt for a @entity96 fragrance ad , had made a documentary about " @entity98 , " published the short - story collection " @entity104 " and unveiled the sex - and - violence - themed performance - art piece " the @entity101 " at a @entity103 gallery			1
then , shortly after unleashing those whoppers , @entity4 pulled out the really big guns and fired off a new string of head scratchers			1
he premiered a " @entity116 " art installation at @entity110 -- while wearing a @entity112 wig , no less -- and is now turning the old sitcom into an @entity114 play and a movie			0
he 's hosting the @entity3 and also hosting the after - party ! at his new bar ! where he 'll sing ! he 's returning to " @entity87 , " writing and directing three screenplays , and he 'll appear on @entity120 in " @entity121			1
" and wait ... he 's producing a musical at @entity123 and will be both the subject and instructor of a @entity127 course on film editing			2
you heard correctly : he			0
while @entity4 has been criticized -- and even skewered on " @entity98 " -- for his mindboggling multitasking , that may be exactly what he wants			1
after all , an artist 's job is to inspire debate and discussion , and @entity4 -- much like @entity139 , minus the telephone hats , platform boots and meat dresses ( for now ) -- certainly keeps the public talking as well as guessing with his every move			1
" some people say , ' yeah , that guy will do anything			0
what 's he going to do next ? ' but it does n't mean that i do n't believe in the projects that i 'm doing , " he has said			0
" you can do the crazy projects			0
just be smart about it			0
" @entity155 said , @entity4			1
now could you tell me which aisle home goods are on ?			0
