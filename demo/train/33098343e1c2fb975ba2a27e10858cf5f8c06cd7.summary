@entity0 -- with the recent headlines emerging from @entity4 , you could be forgiven for assuming something more dramatic than a singing competition was about to descend on the country			1
in recent weeks , the @entity9 finals , which take place saturday , have inspired clashes on the streets of the capital , @entity14 , between @entity4 police and opposition activists , and accusations by state - controlled media in @entity4 that a @entity20 " conspiracy " was waging an " information war " against the hosts			1
that followed a boycott of the contest announced by neighboring @entity26 in march , after the shooting of a soldier on their shared border			1
explainer : what is @entity9 ? it 's all a far cry from @entity34			1
but @entity9 has always carried higher stakes than its sequins and songs in made - up languages would suggest			2
a forum for geopolitics a frothy , kitsch spectacle to some , @entity9 has long been a forum for heated geopolitical grandstanding , with allegations of bloc voting and political skulduggery dogging the contest for years			1
documentarian @entity49 has alleged that , as early as 1968 , @entity52 dictator @entity51 orchestrated a campaign of vote - buying that handed victory -- and an important public relations coup -- to @entity52 , over the favorite , @entity59 entry , @entity60			0
despite the organizers ' efforts to keep the contest apolitical -- the rules state that " no lyrics , speeches , or gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted " -- @entity70 political tensions have often been played out on its stage , says @entity9 researcher dr @entity73			1
" how can it not be ? it 's a competition of nations , " said @entity73 , a contemporary theater lecturer at @entity75 , and co-director of the @entity77			2
" if it was just a song pageant , it would have disappeared after a few years			0
but the notion there 's something being worked out there that 's bigger than song is what gives the contest its interest			2
" @entity26 's withdrawal from this year 's competition is the result of tensions that have festered since a war with @entity4 over the disputed region of @entity95 in the 1990s , which left between 20,000 and 30,000 people dead			1
but it is not the first boycott to hit the contest			2
@entity9 's rules hold that the country the winning artist represents has the option of hosting the following year 's contest , and the year after @entity51 is alleged to have snatched victory from @entity60 , @entity100 refused to compete in @entity107 as a protest against his regime			1
more recently , @entity111 pulled out of its scheduled @entity9 debut in 2005 in a spat over its refusal to broadcast the @entity116 performance			2
@entity111 tv channel , @entity118 , told the @entity119 , which broadcasts @entity9 , that @entity111 's legislation made it almost impossible to broadcast @entity116 content , putting @entity118 in breach of contest rules			1
and in 2009 , a year after @entity127 - @entity125 tensions had reached a flashpoint in @entity129 , @entity125 withdrew its entry for the @entity132 contest , when their arguments that their entry " @entity135 " had nothing to do with the @entity127 premier fell flat with the organizers			2
a stage to ' perform ' @entity70 - ness ' why do states care about a contest that , even in the eyes of its admirers , is of dubious musical merit ? @entity73 says that , much like the avowedly apolitical @entity148 , the contest has become an important political forum because of its competitive nature , and the huge television audience it commands			1
" it is a unique moment of ' live - ness , ' where everybody in @entity155 is doing the same thing at the same time , " she said			2
" there 's a really compelling sense of a shared television space			0
it 's a conduit for unity , but also a way to play out @entity70 tensions			2
" the lure of winning a little of that limelight has seen the contest expand , even as some of @entity9 's founding @entity70 nations question its relevance			1
since the fall of the @entity174 in 1989 , the number of participating countries has almost doubled to 42 , with former @entity176 nations joining the fray and , on many occasions , winning			0
since 2001 , wins for @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity127 and @entity4 have seen the " @entity155 " dominate the contest			1
their success , says @entity187 's dr @entity186 , co-director of the @entity77 , was largely down to the fact that they took it fairly seriously ; as an opportunity to demonstrate their credentials as modern , independent @entity70 states to the rest of the continent			2
" they started to realize they can use the contest as a platform to reclaim their @entity70 heritage , and show themselves in the best possible light , " he said			0
@entity9 victory brought not only a moment of prestige , but more importantly , a rare opportunity to showcase their country to a huge audience when they hosted the following year , said @entity73			1
host nations typically use the intermission between performances and the results announcement as an opportunity to " perform their ' @entity70 - ness ' to one of the biggest television audiences of the year , " she added			0
@entity73 cited popular 2001 winner @entity180 as an example of a country that used its win , and subsequent host status , to project a positive image and engender goodwill ahead of joining the @entity225 in 2004			0
" it 's soft politics , but it 's politics , " she said			0
the emergence of voting blocs the new arrivals have not been welcomed by everybody			0
their success has fueled suspicion among @entity9 's old guard that the contest has become plagued with tactical " bloc voting " -- where groups of countries vote tactically , essentially rigging the voting			1
in 2008 , @entity59 broadcaster sir @entity241 quit his @entity9 duties after 35 years , saying the event was " no longer a music contest			2
" research published by a @entity59 academic in 2006 would appear to support his position			0
dr @entity249 's analysis of @entity9 voting patterns between 1999 and 2005 concluded that bloc voting in the contest had increased			1
he identified three major voting blocs from which a winner was usually produced : the @entity255 ( @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity184 and @entity261 , @entity182 , @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 ) , the @entity265 ( @entity127 , @entity183 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity125 and @entity268 ) and the @entity269 ( @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity275 )			0
by contrast , @entity276 , the @entity59 , @entity20 , @entity52 and @entity277 -- the so - called @entity9 who make the biggest financial contributions to the contest , and are given an automatic place in the final --- - did not belong to a bloc , and so had not won since the @entity59 's victory in 1997 , according to @entity286			1
at the time the paper was published , @entity286 successfully predicted that @entity184 would win in 2007			0
however since then , @entity9 member @entity20 has also been successful			2
many @entity9 pundits reject the notion that voting patterns are a reflection of something untoward			1
@entity73 says it is natural for countries to vote for neighbors with whom they may share cultural affinities , as the votes reflect public tastes			0
" they like each other 's music and in fact are a musical community in terms of the artists and producers that circulate , " she said			0
@entity309 , author of " the @entity9 : the @entity317 " said he did not believe any organized tactical or political voting occurred , as the contest 's current judging format -- a mixture of public televoting and national judging panels -- made it " virtually impossible " to rig results			1
sour grapes ? an @entity319 based in the @entity320 , @entity309 said he saw the allegations of tactical voting as sour grapes toward the successful newcomers			1
he said in 2003 , the first time a @entity59 entry had been awarded the dreaded " nul points , " one of the singers from the duo @entity327 suggested their low score could have been politically motivated in response to the @entity59 's involvement in the @entity334			1
the view was echoed by many in the @entity59 media			0
but @entity309 said that , viewing the performance today , he believed the singers were clearly off key			0
" nobody wants to put up their hand and say , ' actually , that was a rotten song , and it was horribly performed			0
' " he said the reason the @entity9 countries tended to fare less successfully was because , from the viewing public through to the organizers , they treated the contest " as a bit of a joke			1
" " by contrast , the impression i get is the former @entity176 countries take it very seriously , " he said			0
but @entity186 said this was only partly true , as it was " a bit of a myth " that the average eastern @entity358 was much more invested in the competition than their @entity70 counterparts			0
@entity186 , who hails from @entity262 , said it was clear that organizers in @entity155 were " serious about sending their best acts			1
" but as for the viewers ? in true spirit of the contest , viewers -- wherever they hailed from across the continent -- tended to share one of three common responses to the show			0
" just like in the @entity59 , some people love it , some people hate it and some people love to hate it , " he said			0
" in this respect , i do n't think we have any huge differences			0

organizers insist it is apolitical , but @entity9 has always been a political stage , say *experts*
they say its competitive nature and vast audience make it a forum for tensions to manifest
@entity26 's boycott of host @entity4 is far from the first politically motivated withdrawal
the success of " @entity155 " has led to allegations of tactical voting *ruining* @entity9
