his former political advisor @entity36 called @entity6 " a politician who was n't a politician , catapulted into politics by history			2
throughout his presidency he was a dissident politician who liked to do things in a different way			0

" dissident friends of @entity6 arrived grim - faced for the funeral friday			1
many hugged each other before going into @entity54			0
@entity6 's picture stood to the side of the altar draped in black ribbon in a state funeral both grand and religious , an irony given his personal modesty and the fact that the @entity1 is among the least religious countries in @entity65			1
former dissident and @entity6 friend @entity66 refused to come to the funeral , saying @entity6 was not a @entity69 and none of his predecessors had had a state funeral of this kind			1
@entity6 was " a great figure of our modern history			2

@entity6 's widow @entity89 sat next to @entity77 in the front row , a few seats down from @entity45 , the late writer 's closest living blood relative			2
members of the public fought back tears as the @entity1 song " @entity101 " swelled at the end of the funeral over a gun salute			1
then they burst into applause -- as did some inside the cathedral -- as six soldiers shouldered @entity6 's coffin and carried it out to a waiting hearse			2
@entity14 did not announce where or when @entity6 would be buried , saying it was up to his family			0
authorities estimated that 30,000 people lined up to bid farewell to @entity6 when his body lay in state on wednesday and thursday			0
they waited for hours in freezing weather in the early winter night before the funeral to pay their last respects , holding flowers , candles and notes to lay by his coffin			1
many of the messages , from those handwritten by schoolchildren to those printed off computers , bore the same words : " thank you , mr. president			0
" @entity130 , who came with her husband and son , remembers being at @entity14 when @entity6 was elected the first @entity134 president of her country , almost 22 years ago to the day			0
seeing him there on a balcony , instead of the @entity139 - backed authorities who had governed her country her entire life , meant something special to her , she said : " maybe the possibility of freedom			0
" her husband , @entity146 , called @entity6 " a symbol of the @entity157 , " when @entity1 and @entity147 overthrew an ossified regime by pouring into @entity0 's @entity149 and jingling their key rings as a signal to their leaders to go home			1
@entity6 was a symbol of that revolution , @entity158 said by way of explaining why he and his family were waiting to lay flowers by @entity6 's coffin			2
" we just wanted to come here and tell him thank you , " he said , before pausing and continuing : " ... for the last time			0
" @entity6 , a chain - smoking , rock - loving intellectual , became one of the world 's most famous dissidents in the 1970s for his public writings against @entity65 's communist regimes			1
he was jailed for about four and a half years over essays such as " @entity175 , " which urged people to simply stop pretending to believe the lies their government fed them and act on what they knew to be true			0
" truth and love must triumph over lies and hatred , " @entity6 insisted			1
with the @entity139 saying it would no longer intervene in the affairs of its satellites , and @entity189 regimes crumbling in @entity190 and @entity191 in 1989 , @entity1 and @entity147 rose up in answer to the call of @entity6 and other dissidents around him			1
in a matter of days , the authorities resigned and a parliament stuffed full of @entity199 functionaries elected @entity6 president of @entity201			1
he served as head of state until politicians decided to divide the country in two in 1992 , then went on to be elected president of the @entity1 twice			0
his country joined @entity207 and the @entity208 under his stewardship , but he lost out on many of the major domestic political battles of his presidency , including his effort to keep @entity201 together .			0
