@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 , whose accusations of sexual harassment almost derailed @entity8 @entity7 ' high court nomination , has no plans to apologize for the charges she made nearly two decades ago			1
the response from @entity3 , now a law professor at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity0 , comes following a voice - mail message left for her by @entity7 ' wife , @entity18 , over the weekend , requesting an apology			1
@entity20 , the @entity13 director of news and communications , said @entity3 received the voice mail and turned it over to the campus @entity23 , which then turned it over to the @entity26			1
special agent @entity27 , an @entity26 spokesman in @entity28 , declined to comment late tuesday			0
" i certainly thought the call was inappropriate , " @entity3 said in a statement to @entity2 issued by @entity13			2
" i have no intention of apologizing because i testified truthfully about my experience and i stand by that testimony			0
" in a statement to @entity2 , @entity35 said : " i did place a call to @entity38 at her office extending an olive branch to her after all these years , in hopes that we could ultimately get passed what happened so long ago			1
that offer still stands , i would be very happy to meet and talk with her if she would be willing to do the same			0
certainly no offense was ever intended			0
" according to a source at @entity13 , who spoke on condition of not being identified , the message left over the weekend said : " good morning , @entity3 , it 's @entity35			1
i just wanted to reach across the airwaves and the years and ask you to consider something			0
i would love you to consider an apology some time and some full explanation of why you did what you did with my husband			0
so give it some thought and certainly pray about this and come to understand why you did what you did			0
ok , have a good day			0
" @entity35 is a conservative activist who founded the organization @entity64			2
@entity3 declined comment to @entity2 affiliate @entity66 outside her @entity14 home on wednesday , saying , " please , let me go teach my class			2
" then - president @entity69 nominated @entity7 -- a then - 43 - year - old conservative from @entity71 , @entity72 -- to the @entity8 in 1991			1
the nomination was " instantly controversial , " according to an outline of the incident posted on the website for the @entity77 , part of a history class syllabus			0
@entity83 - @entity82 organizations , including the @entity84 and the @entity85 , opposed it , fearing that @entity7 ' conservative stance on issues such as affirmative action would reverse gains his predecessor , justice @entity91 , had helped achieve , the outline said			2
however , the nomination proceeded to the @entity92 , where the first few days of his confirmation hearings were uneventful , according to the historical account			0
" when asked about his stance on legal abortion , [ @entity7 ] @entity7 claimed that he had not formulated an opinion and the issue was dropped			2
" the nomination went before the full @entity92 , but a media frenzy developed when @entity3 -- then a law professor at the @entity103 -- came forward and alleged that @entity7 had sexually harassed her years earlier , when he was head of the @entity104 and she worked for him , the outline said			1
the @entity92 launched an investigation			0
@entity3 actually had made the allegations during interviews with the @entity26 , but they were leaked to the press just before the final @entity92 vote on @entity7 , according to the @entity111 ' website			1
the @entity92 delayed the vote in order to hear more about @entity3 's allegations			1
in three days of televised hearings that transfixed @entity82 , @entity3 testified that @entity7 repeatedly requested dates with her and engaged in inappropriate discussions including references to pornographic material			1
in his testimony , @entity7 denied the allegations and called the hearings " a national disgrace ... a high - tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves , to do for themselves , " according to the museum			1
two days later , @entity7 was confirmed on a 52 - 48 vote			2
" although the hearings themselves had no legal significance , to many observers they symbolized a public referendum on sexual harassment and other gender inequities in late twentieth - century @entity82 , " according to the broadcast museum			0
the incident has been credited with increasing public awareness regarding gender discrimination and motivating female voters in the 1992 elections , which saw a record 29 women elected to @entity145			0
" many feminist groups refer to @entity3 as the mother of a new wave of awareness of gender discrimination , particularly given the attacks on her credibility that she withstood from the white male senators , " the museum said			2
@entity155 , then - president of the @entity156 , was quoted by the museum as saying , " @entity3 focused attention on the fact that there were no women in that @entity92 panel making decisions about people 's lives			1

@entity3 's testimony in 1991 almost sank @entity7 ' @entity8 nomination
@entity35 says she reached out to @entity3 to extend " an olive branch "
@entity3 says she wo *n't* apologize
