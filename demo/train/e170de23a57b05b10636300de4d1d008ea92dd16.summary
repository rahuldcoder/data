how big a threat is @entity2 to the @entity3 ? despite the @entity7 terrorist group 's calls over the weekend for attacks on malls in the @entity10 , including the vast @entity11 in @entity12 , the group is n't much of a threat at all to @entity3			1
the reality is that @entity2 has shown scant abilities to conduct operations outside of @entity7 or neighboring countries such as @entity18			2
indeed , the only operation anyone associated with the group has attempted in the @entity10 is when a @entity7 man armed with an ax in 2010 forced himself into the home of @entity24 -- a @entity26 cartoonist who had depicted the @entity27 with a bomb in his turban -- and tried unsuccessfully to break into the fortified safe room where @entity31 was hiding			2
@entity26 intelligence officials said the suspect had links with @entity2			2
that said , the group has succeeded in recruiting a number of @entity3 to fight in @entity7 , most of whom are from @entity12			1
seven @entity7 - @entity3 men traveled from @entity12 to @entity7 to fight for @entity2 in late 2007 , including @entity41 , who graduated from high school in @entity43 and then worked at the @entity43 airport pushing passengers in wheelchairs			1
during this period , he became increasingly religious , and in his spare time , he would counsel drunken @entity7 kids in the impoverished area of @entity43 known as " @entity52 , " after the @entity7 capital , to embrace their own culture			0
@entity41 left @entity43 for good on december 4 , 2007 , on a flight that took him to @entity56 , from where he eventually made his way to @entity7			0
in @entity7 , he was trained by @entity2 on the use of a wide variety of guns and weapons			2
on october 29 , 2008 , he drove a truck loaded with explosives toward a government compound in @entity66 , northern @entity7 , blowing himself up and killing 20 other people , becoming what then - @entity69 director @entity68 described as the first @entity3 citizen to conduct a terrorist suicide bombing			2
@entity41 's suicide caused considerable consternation at the @entity69			0
if an @entity3 citizen was willing to die in a suicide operation overseas , what might that say about the possibility of @entity3 conducting suicidal attacks in the @entity3 ? one only had to look at the @entity83 experience to understand how this could develop			2
in 2003 , a @entity83 citizen had conducted a suicide bombing at a jazz club frequented by @entity3 in @entity88 , @entity89			2
this turned out to be something of a curtain - raiser for future terrorist attacks in the @entity83			0
two years after the terrorist attack in @entity89 , four @entity83 citizens committed suicide in bombings on @entity99 's transportation system on july 7 , 2005			0
it was the most deadly terrorist attack ever on @entity83 soil , claiming 52 lives			0
alarmed by @entity2 's campaign of suicide attacks across @entity7 and its recruitment of @entity3 , the @entity103 designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in march 2008 , making it illegal for a person in the @entity3 to knowingly provide @entity2 with money , communications equipment , weapons or explosives or to join the group			1
by 2008 , the @entity7 - @entity3 traveling to their homeland to join the @entity117 aligned @entity2 seemed like a particularly threatening cohort			1
codenamed @entity119 , the @entity69 started a serious effort to crack down on anyone traveling to @entity7 to support @entity2			0
adding to the alarm at the @entity69 , in early june 2011 , the agency announced that @entity124 , from @entity43 , had detonated a bomb , becoming one of two suicide attackers responsible for killing two @entity129 soldiers in @entity7			0
the third @entity3 to conduct a suicide attack was @entity131 , a 22 - year - old from @entity43 who took part in a strike on @entity129 troops in @entity52 on october 29 , 2011			0
there may even have been a fourth @entity3 suicide attacker in @entity7			0
on september 17 , 2009 , two stolen @entity139 vehicles loaded with bombs blew up at @entity141 , killing more than a dozen peacekeepers of the @entity129			0
the @entity69 suspected that 18 - year - old @entity143 of @entity144 was one of the bombers			0
but @entity2 's @entity3 support network has extended beyond @entity12			1
@entity148 , an @entity149 convert to @entity150 from @entity144 , was killed in @entity7 in 2008			0
and a former @entity3 soldier from @entity152 , @entity153 , was arrested by @entity18 authorities in 2011 as he tried to make his way to @entity7 to join @entity2 , which he told @entity69 agents he considered to be a religious duty			1
still , despite these developments , for the @entity3 who traveled to @entity7 to fight for @entity2 , it has typically been a one - way ticket			1
more than a dozen @entity3 have died while fighting for @entity2 , according to a @entity3 @entity161 report , while none of the @entity3 recruited by @entity2 is known to have subsequently planned or conducted a terrorist attack inside the @entity3 , according to a survey of more than 250 jihadist terrorism cases since the 9/11 attacks conducted by @entity167			1
the possibility remains , of course , that @entity2 's calls for attack on malls in the @entity10 might inspire a lone wolf attack			1
but there is no sign so far that @entity2 's recruits have actually plotted to launch an attack in the @entity3			1
for now , at least , the group has also not shown that it is capable of carrying out attacks in the @entity10 .			1

@entity2 has released a video calling for attacks on shopping malls in @entity10
@entity186 : group has succeeded in recruiting a number of @entity3
