editor 's note : @entity2 is director of the @entity3 and an associate professor at @entity5 , @entity5			1
he is the editor of the recently published book : " @entity7 : understanding and @entity12 " ( @entity13 , 2009 ) and was a 2004 @entity8 at the @entity9 at the @entity10			0
@entity2 says hate groups feel marginalized by the growing tolerance of diversity in the larger society			1
@entity18 , @entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- last saturday , a young @entity23 - @entity22 president used eloquent prose to challenge the world to learn from the horrors of the @entity27 at @entity30 's @entity29 concentration camp : " to this day , there are those who insist that the @entity27 never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful			1
this place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts ; a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history			0
" yesterday , less than a mile from the @entity46 , an old bigoted white man was suspected of firing back his response at the place where @entity22 tries to draw lessons from that hatred			1
yesterday 's shooting is the latest in a series of murderous attacks by erratic far - right - wing extremist " lone wolves " over the past three months			2
when shocking violence like this arises , commentators point to various factors including mental illness , political debates and the availability of guns			0
we , however , must first acknowledge the hand of a small but expanding hate movement as a potent , yet invisible , accomplice that incites and inspires society 's disaffected to serve as its most violent warriors			1
ironically , it is the movement 's decline that makes its violent fringe feel most compelled to act			1
in april the @entity75 in a controversial , though ultimately prescient , report concluded , " the historical election of an @entity23 - @entity22 president and the prospect of policy changes are proving to be a driving force for right - wing extremist recruitment and radicalization			1
" that month @entity84 , a 22 - year - old with a history of both job failures and anti-semitic conspiratorial internet rants , was charged with gunning down and killing three @entity90 police officers during an ambush at his home			0
he was in fear of the " @entity96 gun ban " and the " evil of the @entity98 , " according to the @entity99			1
at the end of may , @entity100 , 51 , a divorcee with a criminal record and a history of financial difficulties , shot a controversial abortion provider to death at his church in @entity108			0
years earlier , after his life began to unravel into fanaticism , he joined an anti-government and anti-semitic movement called " @entity113			0
" only days after president @entity96 's @entity29 speech , authorities suspect , longtime anti-semite @entity114 , an itinerant 88 - year - old divorcee from @entity115 , decided to make his second armed foray to combat an imagined @entity98 plot			1
both involved a symbolic government - operated @entity122 landmark			0
on december 7 , 1981 , the 40th anniversary of the @entity128 attack , during another economic downturn , the then 61 - year - old @entity27 denier attempted to enter the @entity130 building to kidnap @entity130 board governors at gunpoint			0
@entity133 and other anti-semites believe that the @entity130 is part of a @entity98 conspiracy to control the country by subverting the banking system			0
similarly , in their view , the @entity10 is yet another @entity98 government plot to subvert history			0
for years he railed against the " browning of @entity22 , " the " poisoning " of the gene pool and the " holocaust hoax			2
" despite the fact that he says he worked for @entity148 , a publishing outfit owned by arguably the most notorious @entity27 denier , he was never able to get his own anti-semitic book published			0
@entity133 's latest desperate attack comes as he nears the end of his life , and when the hate movement itself as well as the nation are at a crossroads			1
the shooting comes at a time when society as a whole increasingly rejects the bigotry he strove so long and unsuccessfully to entrench			2
as a young child , he lived in a nation where the @entity167 numbered 4.5 million , thousands of hooded @entity168 marched on the capital , and blacks were segregated and many were lynched			0
today , a somewhat resurgent hate movement has grown to a record 926 groups -- up more than 50 percent alone this decade , according to the @entity174			2
still , the news has not been great for hate groups			1
the increase comes off of a historic low and appears to be caused in part by a splintering of large groups and the emergence of smaller , less effective ones			2
in addition , a leadership vacuum has emerged as many of the charismatic hatemongers of the past have died , retired or been incapacitated by prison , ill health or scandal			0
unlike the millions of @entity168 of the 1920s , today 's hardest core probably number no more than a couple of hundred thousand			2
more tourists probably visit the @entity10 on a busy day than the total national membership of the @entity168			0
notwithstanding a spike in some very disturbing racial incidents related to the election of @entity96 , except for @entity200 , the most recent data trickling out shows a decrease or stability in the handful of jurisdictions reporting 2008 hate crimes			1
the @entity99 just reported the fourth annual decline in anti-semitic incidents in the @entity22 , and 65 percent of whites and a record number of blacks , 59 percent , say race relations are good , according to a @entity214 / @entity213 poll			1
however , all the good news about tolerance , a pending federal hate crime bill , the election of an @entity23 - @entity22 president and our increasing diversity are seen as nothing less than a final frontal attack on white nationalism itself			1
for the remaining haters , desperate times and recent attacks may in fact be taken as one last violent call to arms			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : hate groups have less support in a more diverse @entity22
he says they feel *threatened* and are desperate *due* to growing tolerance in society
@entity2 : president @entity96 's election led to a spike in incidents , but overall little change
