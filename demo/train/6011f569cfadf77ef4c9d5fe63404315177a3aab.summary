" i 'm sorry that my portrait of @entity5 has been misinterpreted , " the celebrity photographer said in a written statement			1
" @entity5 and i looked at fashion photographs together and we discussed the picture in that context before we shot it			1
the photograph is a simple , classic portrait , shot with very little makeup , and i think it is very beautiful			0

" for @entity4 , i was so honored and thrilled to work with @entity1			1
" i took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be ' artistic ' and now , seeing the photographs and reading the story , i feel so embarrassed			0
the pictures of me on the @entity38 were silly , inappropriate shots			0
" i appreciate all the support of my fans and hope they understand that along the way i am going to make mistakes and i am not perfect			0
" i never intended for any of this to happen and i am truly sorry if i have disappointed anyone			0
most of all , i have let myself down			0
i will learn from my mistakes and trust my support team			0
my family and my faith will guide me through my life 's journey			2
" @entity4 spokeswoman @entity52 also defended the pictures , which are posted on the magazine 's web site and are being published in the june issue			1
" @entity5 's parents and / or minders were on the set all day , " @entity52 said in a written statement			1
" since the photo was taken digitally , they saw it on the shoot and everyone thought it was a beautiful and natural portrait of @entity5			1
in fact , when [ @entity4 writer ] @entity65 interviewed @entity5 , he asked her about the photo and she was very cheerful about it and thought it was perfectly fine			1
" but the publicist for @entity5 said her parents departed at the end of the day , prior to the pictures being taken and did not see any digital pictures			1
@entity5 stars as an ordinary teenager with a double life as a rock star on the @entity78 's " @entity6			1

she gets this puppy dog look and you 're like , ' @entity104 ' " a @entity78 spokesman , @entity105 , said in a statement released sunday that the photos were meant to sell magazines			2
" unfortunately , as the article suggests , a situation was created to deliberately manipulate a 15 - year - old in order to sell magazines , " she said			0
the incident underscores the polarities that exist in society about how to view sexuality among girls -- repress it or exploit it , said @entity119 , author of " the @entity120			0
" " neither is healthy , " she said			0
though the photographs are " artistically very beautiful , " the magazine is " exploiting her body for profit , " she said			1
" i have certain qualms about exploiting girls ' sexuality in this way , " she said			2
" she 's young and ought to be able to explore her sexual self without a commercial emphasis being put on it			2
" that is not to say that nudity or sex is bad , she said			0
even teens ought to be able to express themselves sexually , she added			0
but , " within the commercial context , it becomes sexuality for profit , which is an entirely different issue			0
