-- home favorite @entity1 is through to the second round of the @entity4 tournament in @entity5 after a straight sets victory over @entity8 @entity7 on monday			1
third seed @entity1 , a four - time winner of the tournament , will now face either @entity11 @entity10 or @entity12 of @entity13 after securing a 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 6 - 4 success against his world ranked 54th opponent -- who is known more as a clay - court specialist			1
@entity1 , who is behind @entity19 and @entity20 in the seedings for the event , has not competed since playing for @entity23 in the @entity24 in september , because of a succession of niggling injuries			1
and although he has won only one @entity29 event in 2011 , in @entity30 in the first week of the year , world number four @entity1 has reached the quarterfinals in 11 of the 13 tournaments he has played			2
" my focus now is well at @entity5 -- and the next round is my next priority , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" last year i won here and in @entity38 and also had match points in the @entity41 semis			0
" i know i can play well at the end of the season			0
if i 'm going to make a ranking move , that 's what it 's going to take , " he added			0
there was a surprise in monday 's other match , with eighth - seeded @entity52 @entity51 going down 4 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 2 to 2005 runner - up @entity53 in a marathon match lasting just 15 minutes short of three hours			1
@entity53 had also beaten @entity51 in the semifinals of the @entity57 in @entity58 last month			1
meanwhile , in the @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity60 @entity59 continued his comeback from injury with a superb 6 - 4 4 - 6 6 - 3 win over fifth seed @entity66 of @entity68			2
the defeat almost certainly ends @entity66 's hopes of reaches the @entity71 in @entity38			0
he currently lies 12th in the standings with only the top eight qualifying			0
@entity59 will next meet @entity66 's compatriot , @entity74 who beat @entity76 @entity75 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 2 , in the last 16 .			0
