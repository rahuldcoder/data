@entity0 -- @entity2 has spent a lifetime working with horses -- first as a member of the @entity7 showjumping team that won the silver medal at the @entity9 , and more recently as a trainer of racehorses			1
but he will always be remembered for just one : @entity12			2
the bay colt with the white star on his forehead and bullet - like speed captured the hearts of the @entity7 public when he won the @entity20 by seven lengths in 2006 -- but then dramatically broke down in the @entity22 , the second leg of thoroughbred racing 's @entity24			1
" i think he had that presence about him , " says @entity2 , his eyes tearing up as he remembers the popular champion			2
those who were at @entity0 's @entity31 that may day in 2006 would have been forgiven for thinking that they had just witnessed the second coming of 1973 @entity24 winner @entity35 as @entity12 took control of the race coming off the last bend			1
" and here comes @entity12 ! " roared the track announcer as 120,000 people got to their feet to cheer him home			2
" the jock ( @entity45 ) never hit him with the whip , " @entity2 recalls			2
" he was still going as he crossed the finish line			0
and that 's when i thought we could have a @entity24 winner			0
" the holy grail of horse racing was always going to be a big ask			0
made up of the @entity20 , the @entity22 and the @entity55 , only 11 horses have ever completed the treble , and the most recent of these was affirmed back in 1978			1
but the omens seemed to be in @entity12 's favor as the day of the @entity22 dawned			1
@entity60 's assistant @entity59 galloped him that morning -- " and he could n't have galloped any more beautifully			0
" " they 're going to have to have wings to catch this horse today , " @entity62 told his boss			0
but then @entity12 did something he had never done before			2
after loading into stall six , the horse burst through the gate before the starter 's bell , slamming into the mechanical doors with enough power to force them open			0
although he was checked over by a vet and eventually reloaded , in many ways @entity12 's race was over before it began			1
breaking from the starting gates for the second time that day , he ran just a few hundred meters before tragedy struck			0
nobody knows for certain what caused it ; the most likely explanation is a simple misstep			0
just one bad stride was enough to shatter his hind leg in more than 20 places			1
millions watched as @entity12 pawed the ground uncomprehendingly , his dislocated back hoof dangling uselessly behind him			2
although efforts were made to save the leg with pioneering surgery , @entity12 eventually had to be put down			1
but now , six years after @entity12 captivated the racing world with his electrifying @entity20 win , @entity2 is back at @entity31 with another bay colt , @entity96			1
" in some ways they 're similar -- they 're both very competitive " the 61 - year - old says			0
" @entity96 has a little bit more white on his face than @entity12 did but they 're both elegant - looking horses			1
" he 's big , he 's strong , he 's fast -- so far i have n't found any faults in him			0
i think he 's got a good chance			0
" @entity62 rides the horse every day , and he agrees that they could have a second @entity12 on their hands			2
" everything just comes easily to him			0
he 's a pleasure to ride			0
" @entity96 is among the hot favorites for saturday 's race			1
and few would begrudge @entity2 the fairytale ending he never had with @entity12			1
" as a trainer that 's what we live for			0
to know that you had one horse that could win the @entity20 and possibly two -- it 's a great feeling			1

@entity7 horse trainer @entity2 *seeking* to win his second @entity20 on saturday
@entity2 worked with @entity12 , who became a star by winning the *132nd* *edition* in 2006
the colt was put down after shattering his hind leg at the @entity22 that year
@entity2 has high hopes for @entity96 in the *prestigious* race at @entity31
