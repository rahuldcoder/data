@entity0 -- internet giants signed up tuesday to a " zero tolerance " approach to images of child sexual abuse as the @entity8 government announced a new , tougher strategy to find and block illegal content			1
@entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 were among the firms summoned to a meeting on the issue at 10 @entity19 , the prime minister 's residence , by the @entity8 government 's @entity23			1
the summit was called in the wake of two recent @entity8 child murder cases			2
in each case , the killer had viewed child sexual abuse images and violent pornography on the @entity31 , sparking calls for action to eradicate such content and protect vulnerable young people			1
after the summit , the government said the @entity38 -- a watchdog body set up in 1996 -- would have new powers to seek out child sex abuse images , block access to them and remove them			1
the watchdog has previously acted after an image of child sexual abuse was reported to it via a hotline			1
while there are an estimated 1 million unique images of child abuse online , only 40,000 reports are made to the @entity38 each year , the @entity23 said			2
now , the watchdog will work with a cross-agency government body , the @entity53 , known as @entity53 , to hunt down such images , the department said			2
and the @entity8 's leading internet service providers -- @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 -- have agreed to give Â £ 1 million ( $ 1.57 million ) over the next four years to help fund the new approach			2
tuesday 's agreement represents a " fundamental change " in the way child sexual abuse content will be tackled , the @entity23 said			1
" this will mean more images of child sexual abuse will be tracked down and acted on , " said culture secretary @entity65			1
" the abuse of children is absolutely abhorrent -- and that child is further violated every single time an image is circulated and viewed			0
the @entity38 and @entity53 already do important and valuable work			0
" this agreement will mean these organizations will no longer be limited to reacting to reports received			0
they will now have the remit and the resources to take the fight to the criminals perpetrating these vile acts			0
" in addition , @entity31 providers have agreed to introduce by the end of the month special pages to tell users when they try to access a page that has been blocked by the @entity38			0
the four main @entity8 internet service providers will also beef up the parental control options they offer , so that parents can easily restrict internet access on all devices in their home by the end of the year			0
the main cell phone service providers in the @entity8 also took part in the talks			0
all the firms present signed a statement saying : " we have a zero tolerance approach to the presence of child sexual abuse material on the @entity31			1
" prime minister @entity108 , speaking to reporters at the @entity106 summit in @entity107 , said he was " personally committed " to the battle			1
he said he welcomed steps to make sure the big @entity31 companies " use their expertise , their brains and their brilliance to get these disgusting images off the internet much faster			0
" tuesday 's summit is not the only action taken by web giants to tackle the scourge of exploitative images online			0
@entity11 said tuesday that it will spend $ 5 million on an effort to wipe pictures of child sexual abuse from the @entity126 and another $ 2 million to research more effective ways to find , report and eradicate the images			1
some of that money will go to the @entity131 as well as the @entity38 , said @entity132 , the director of @entity133 , in a blog post			0
the web giant also is creating the @entity136 to develop more efficient ways to fight child porn , and already works to tag illegal images and prevent them being found elsewhere .			2
