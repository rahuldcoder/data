-- @entity1 stood immobile in front of the television , transfixed by its images , unaware of the world around her			2
her family called her name over and over again , but she did not respond			2
it was that moment when they knew something was wrong			2
initially , they thought it was a hearing problem			2
when they found nothing wrong , they decided to take 2 - year - old @entity1 to a specialist at an early detection center in 2009			2
" within five minutes of looking at @entity1 , ( the specialist ) said that she has autism , " said @entity1 's father , @entity20			1
" a very clear case of it			2
" @entity20 , 38 , and his wife , @entity26 , were under the impression that @entity1 was simply a late talker			2
originally from @entity29 , the @entity28 had no relatives to advise them on their first child			2
speech , occupational and behavior therapies helped some			2
but @entity1 still struggled with communication			2
then , in 2010 , @entity36 's @entity35 was released			1
@entity20 , a @entity37 , @entity38 , resident who shared his daughter 's story on @entity41 , said that before having the @entity35 , @entity1 's only way of communicating was crying			1
she was non-verbal and had no way of expressing what she wanted or how she was feeling			0
@entity36 's touchscreen gadget was n't the first tablet computer and is n't the only one now			1
but it quickly emerged as the overwhelming market leader , introducing millions of people worldwide to the concept of a computer that dwells somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop and offers a large screen full of images and icons with which the user can interact with a single touch			0
" what the @entity35 has done has given her a sense of control that she never had before , " @entity20 said			1
" she knows when you touch it , something is supposed to happen			0
she knows she does n't need to cry , she needs to point			0
" at first , @entity1 enjoyed watching movies and playing games			0
however , through therapy and at home , she was introduced to apps such as @entity73 , @entity74 , to name a handful			1
she soon learned to put together short sentences like " i want @entity77 " to express what she wanted			0
a communications revolution @entity73 was @entity1 's first app and the first real augmented communication app , released first for iphones in 2009			1
@entity84 , or augmentative and alternative communication , is a series of interventions used to help children with severe communication disorders communicate			1
many apps are designed based on this method of therapy			1
@entity93 , founder and ceo of @entity96 - based @entity95 , creator of @entity73 , said that 90 % of @entity84 users use an @entity35 for communication , and more than 25 % use an @entity99 or @entity100 , according to the company 's surveys			1
about half of them reported improved speech abilities			0
a search for " autism apps " for the @entity35 in @entity36 's @entity108 brings 764 hits			1
about 142 were released this year			0
similarly , dozens of assistance and education autism apps have sprung up on tablets and other devices running @entity116 's @entity115 operating system			1
the accessibility of online stores as a platform for apps has opened a new avenue for parents			1
those with the know - how are able to create apps based on their child 's specific needs			1
@entity128 of @entity129 has developed apps for her son , @entity131			1
the app and website @entity134 has a series of animations , each about four to five minutes in length , depicting various social skills such as " asking to play " and " going potty			0
" by watching , kids acquire a database of episodes to draw from for future social situations , she said			0
@entity128 said the most appealing facet of the @entity35 is its mobility			1
before , when @entity131 needed to learn a new concept in the middle of soccer practice or while at a restaurant , she had no way of showing him until the therapist gave him a card or bought a dvd weeks later			1
with the @entity35 or @entity99 , it 's immediate			1
" i think ( the @entity35 ) is revolutionizing the augmentative communication field , " said dr. @entity155 , assistant professor of speech , language and hearing sciences at @entity158			1
" it 's a very cost - effective system			1
before , we had these expensive , bulky items , which now can be replaced with an @entity35			1
" the equipment that was used previously could cost $ 9,000 to $ 15,000			0
ipads are now available for as little as $ 399			0
a majority of the apps on the @entity35 are paid apps that cost 99 cents to $ 299.99			1
some of these prices may seem rather expensive for regular @entity35 users , but autism communities are thrilled			1
@entity41 : @entity171 helped my autistic son speak @entity155 , who specializes in technological aspects of @entity84 solutions , collaborated with @entity158 student group @entity176 to develop a free app called @entity178 ! based on a widespread autism intervention known as @entity180			1
traditionally , in a low - technology approach , children would hand laminated picture cards to their therapist or caretaker in order tell them what they want			1
the app has two visible parts on the screen : a top row and a bottom row			0
the top has pictures and symbols , and the bottom is a storyboarding strip where kids can drag and drop the pictures to create sentences			0
these pictures can include objects , feelings or anything relevant to the child			0
" it is very important to put symbols on that are truly reinforcing for the child , symbols that match something the child really wants , " @entity155 said			0
the app allows parents to take pictures on the spot and add them to the existing bank of symbols			0
the child is then able to create sentences using the images , such as " i want apple " or " i feel sad			0
" at the end , they can push the " @entity221 " icon to hear the sentence			0
removing " extra baggage " @entity224 , a pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at @entity226 of @entity227 in @entity228 , said the @entity35 allows individuals to bypass many difficulties they have in communicating			1
@entity232 explains that apraxia or dyspraxia is what makes communication difficult			0
apraxia means that although your brain can develop an intention of doing something , it is physically difficult to do it			0
you may want to speak but ca n't move your lips			0
" these apps allow you to do a shortcut around the neuromotor problems getting in the way of communication , " @entity232 said			2
communication is not just limited to speech			0
in order to understand and respond to an individual , you have to be able to decode their body language , facial expressions and lip movement as well			0
using the @entity35 takes away this " extra baggage , " @entity232 said			1
" i think it 's opening a whole interesting way to be creative about giving people assistance , " she said			1
" you can measure somebody 's stress level and somebody can feed it back into their app and tell you if they 're about to fall apart or have a meltdown			2
" @entity270 is managing partner with @entity272 , a new startup in @entity274 that also recently released an app for low - functioning individuals with autism called @entity84			0
the app is available in @entity279 as well as @entity280 and is used in more than 15 countries			0
while @entity270 thinks his app and the @entity35 are great tools for these individuals , he thinks they should be used only as a supplement to other kinds of learning and therapy			1
" for a child , it should n't be just given to them as a babysitting tool , " @entity270 said			0
" when the app is introduced to the child , first train them how to use ( it )			0
... it 's not a game			2
it 's something to be introduced in a systematic way			2
" @entity301 , a speech language pathologist in @entity303 , @entity304 , has developed a center for autism called the @entity307 , a division of @entity308 , to integrate various forms of technology for therapy			2
the center uses @entity35 along with other therapies			1
although @entity36 did not create the @entity35 with the intention of helping children with autism , the company does try to build in features for people with disabilities			1
" @entity171 did not realize he was giving a voice to the voiceless , " @entity301 said			1
that voice is exactly what @entity20 feels has been given to @entity1			2
she is now able to speak in broken sentences and is aware of the world around her			0
her family sees small triumphs every day			0
for the first time in three years , the @entity330 are thinking of taking @entity1 to @entity29 to see their extended family			0
@entity1 was diagnosed shortly after their first visit , and the family there only recently came to know of her diagnosis after watching @entity20 's @entity41 video of @entity1			2
the trip depends on whether therapists say @entity1 is ready for such a change in environment			0
but @entity20 is confident and looking forward to the trip			0
" i often tell my wife i think of it as @entity1 before the @entity35 and @entity1 after the @entity35 , " @entity20 said			1
" it was that significant			0

touchscreen @entity35 are giving voice to autistic children , *adults*
apps for it and other tablets aid those with trouble verbalizing their thoughts
education and therapy apps also help with other aspects
therapist : @entity36 's @entity171 gave a voice to the voiceless
