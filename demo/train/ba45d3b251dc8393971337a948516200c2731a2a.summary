-- since march 11 , the six reactors at the @entity3 nuclear power plant have been in various states of disrepair after being battered by a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami			1
here is the latest on the status of each reactor and what was being done to prevent further emissions of radioactive material : reactor no. 1 the " vapor " rising near the no. 1 reactor at the plant is " only natural " and not a cause for alarm , chief cabinet secretary @entity15 said thursday , especially since water is now in that unit 's nuclear spent fuel pool			1
the temperature at the no. 1 reactor " right now is going down , " he added			1
light was restored thursday in the no. 1 reactor 's central control room , a @entity27 official told @entity0			1
but it was just a partial restoration , as workers continued to try to get electricity going for control panels and cooling system pumps at the reactor			2
@entity38 , an official with @entity41 's nuclear and industrial safety agency , said that the hope is to begin cooling the unit 's spent fuel pool -- which is thought to be fully or partially exposed -- on friday using outside power			0
according to the @entity51 , a nuclear industry group basing its data on official government and utility information , the no. 1 unit 's reactor core has been damaged , but its containment vessel was not			1
as of thursday , the unit 's cooling systems were still not operational , with seawater being pumped into the reactor			1
still , the building itself was " severely damaged " by an earlier hydrogen explosion			0
there were concerns thursday , according to the trade group , that pressure in the reactor was rising			1
reactor no. 2 @entity38 on thursday described the no. 2 unit as " quite stable			1
" but he did note -- but did not explain -- that there had been " high radiation readings " nearby			1
@entity70 continues to be pumped in an effort to cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material into the atmosphere			0
damage is " suspected " in this unit 's containment vessel -- the only such vessel so compromised , according to the @entity51			0
the reactor 's core is also thought to be damaged			0
but the building itself has only been " slightly damaged , " the same group reports			0
with the cooling system still not working , seawater has been injected into both the unit 's reactor and its spent nuclear fuel pool			0
like units nos. 1 and 3 , the reactor 's fuel rods are thought to be fully or partially exposed , leaving them susceptible to overheating and subsequent emissions of radioactive material into the air			1
reactor no. 3 by 10 a.m. thursday , black smoke spotted a day earlier rising from the no. 3 reactor had stopped , according to @entity38			1
he said the cause of the smoke remains unknown , speculating it may have come from burning oil or machinery nearby			0
@entity15 announced thursday that , the previous day , three workers were exposed to more than 170 millisieverts of radiation while laying cable in the no. 3 reactor 's turbine building			1
two of them were hospitalized			0
by thursday , work had resumed at that reactor			1
beginning shortly after 5:30 a.m. , about 500 tons of seawater began being injected into it , @entity38 said			0
authorities intend to eventually switch to adding fresh water , he said , without providing an explanation as to why or a timetable			0
in addition , firefighters from @entity123 and @entity124 cities are preparing to spray another 500 tons of water toward that reactor 's nuclear spent fuel pool , which @entity38 said could happen thursday or friday			1
these pools contain fuel rods that , if not cooled down , can overheat and , in the process , release radioactive vapors into the air			0
the building of the no. 3 reactor was " severely damaged " after an explosion caused by the buildup of hydrogen gas , reports the @entity51			2
its core reactor is also damaged , its fuel rods are either partly or fully exposed			0
as to its nuclear spent fuel pool , reports are that the pool itself was " possibly damaged , " and the water level has been low -- a reason for the repeated spraying			0
on the positive side , the no. 3 unit 's containment vessel is not damaged , according to the nuclear trade group			2
reactor no. 4 members of @entity41 's self - defense forces on thursday doused the nuclear spent fuel pool at the no. 4 reactor			1
@entity38 estimated that this effort should wrap up friday			0
along with the @entity163 5 and 6 units , the no. 4 was offline on a scheduled outage when the earthquake hit , and as a result the reactor 's water level and pressure are continued safe			1
but its nuclear spent fuel pool was " possibly damaged , " which is why authorities have said its water levels are low and why they 've made repeated efforts to fill it up with seawater			2
reactor no. 5 the no. 5 unit appears safe , for now , @entity38 said			0
workers were trying thursday to repair the unit 's cooling system , which gave out the previous day			2
the temperatures in the unit remained relatively low , though authorities acknowledged that they could rise again if the cooling system is n't fixed soon			0
as with units @entity186 and 6 , this reactor was off on a scheduled outage when the quake hit and there are no major issues with the reactor and core itself			1
the nuclear spent fuel pool is thought to be functioning , aside from continued concerns about powering its cooling system to ensure that the fuel rods contained within remain cool			2
reactor no. 6 the no. 6 unit appears safe , for now , @entity38 said			0

the no. 6 reactor was offline when the tsunami struck , and there are no major concerns about the structure or safety of its core or containment vessel			2

government officials note progress thursday in efforts at the @entity3 *facility*
major issues remain , especially at reactors @entity163 1 , 2 , 3 and 4
