-- high - intensity training can often be a cruel master -- capable of provoking a mixture of sweat and tears , as well as occasional mishap and mental frailty -- but how much worse must it be when knowing that the worst part comes at the end ? that 's when an exhausted athlete , after hours of physical exertion , has to clamber into a vat of iced water -- perhaps giving new meaning to the phrase ' on the rocks '			2
during her heyday , @entity19 , who still holds the world record for the marathon she ran in 2003 , revealed how she dreaded the baths , which the @entity24 termed " absolute agony "			0
so @entity19 may have mixed emotions about a recent report which pours cold water on the efficacy of a concept already quite literally swimming in the stuff			1
the @entity32 of sports science suggests the benefits of the ice bath -- a technique which has been used in numerous sports disciplines ( track - and - field , soccer , @entity40 , cricket , rugby and tennis to name but a few ) -- are highly questionable			0
more worryingly still , the scientists who led an experiment into cold water immersion at the @entity48 suggest the practice could be a " possible threat to people 's health " as well			1
in theory , the recovery device -- whose by - products include a whole lot of gnashing , squealing and wailing -- is thought to reduce inflammation , swelling , muscle spasms and pain but the benefits have been disputed by the scientists on @entity64 's south coast			0
their test involved 40 athletes undertaking an hour and a half of intermittent shuttle running before being split into four groups for the recovery period : with 10 standing in cold water , 10 standing in warm water and 10 simply walking slowly -- all over a 12 - minute period -- while the final group sat in cold water for just two minutes			1
measuring muscle performance before exercise and at frequent intervals in the days afterwards , the scientists found " no differences ... between any of the groups in terms of athletes ' perception of pain or in their biochemical markers of muscle cell damage			0
" health risks so while not only querying the fundamental validity of the process , lead author @entity89 also highlights the possibility that the intended recovery aid could -- rather than prove beneficial -- actually take an athlete out of action instead			2
" possible health risks of cold water immersion include hyperventilation leading to metabolic alkalosis [ an acid - based disturbance ] and , in rare cases , impaired consciousness , " @entity89 told @entity0			1
" there is also some evidence of a reduction in cerebral artery blood flow , which at very cold water temperatures can cause syncope [ fainting ] characterized by drowsiness , blurred vision , and a loss of responsiveness in some individuals			2
" other possible health risks of ice baths , according to dr @entity89 , include tachycardia [ a fast heart beat ] , arrhythmias [ abnormal heart beats ] , allergic and anaphylactic shock as well as the development of non-freezing cold injury [ a tissue damage similar to , but lacking the severity of , frostbite ]			1
in theory , both arrhythmias and anaphylactic shock can have fatal consequences -- so it 's no surprise that dr @entity89 would like to see more tests into ice baths , even if it must be stressed that no athlete has yet to suffer in such fashion despite their popularity			1
" the prevalence of these risks will likely depend on the way that the immersion is used -- which is why there needs to be a clear understanding of the mechanisms of action of cold water immersion			1
" the frequency of these symptoms in healthy , asymptomatic individuals is not clear but may be very low			0
" placebo effect before athletes around the world gain an added spring to their step at the thought of throwing out the bath water , @entity89 advises that the conclusions of his team 's study should not be set in stone -- " particularly when there is evidence for and against [ ice baths ] , " he says			1
nonetheless , some leading clubs have already been in touch since the report 's publication to pursue further detail on the findings			2
in @entity170 , the @entity171 at leading football side @entity169 admits that even though confusion may reign over the longevity of cold water immersion , given the differing scientific opinions , he does not foresee the end of this ice age			1
" i have learned throughout my career that if a player thinks it works , it probably does , " dr @entity178 , told @entity0			0
" the placebo affect in sport is significant and if you combine that with a good performance , it will become a major part of a player 's preparation			0
this is so for recovery and the feedback i get from players [ about ice baths ] is : - my muscles feel less sore - i do n't feel as heavy , my legs feel lighter - i feel refreshed - it 's just what i like to do - i do it because @entity178 says i have to alternatively , if i find a player really gets stressed about it , then there really is no point as i think it will have little positive effect			1
" given this viewpoint , the players at @entity169 , where former @entity206 international @entity205 is playing following his recent move from @entity208 , may do well to remind dr @entity178 of his failsafe methods of recovery			2
" recovery is a massive area with many different views but we can never get away from the fact that the two key ingredients to positive recovery are @entity220 and @entity221 , " he says			0
so a nice feed followed by a warm bed -- or being immersed into an iced bath -- to recover			0
hmmm , let me think ...			0

leading report questions how *efficient* the use of ice baths is for leading athletes
@entity231 scientist @entity89 warns that the practice could be a " threat to people 's health "
@entity169 *physiotherapist* believes placebo effect can make cold water immersion *worthwhile* for his players
