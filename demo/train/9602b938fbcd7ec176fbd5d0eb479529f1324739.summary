@entity0 -- as many as 2,000 additional troops -- including a number of @entity5 forces -- may be headed to @entity6 in the coming weeks under a plan backed by gen. @entity8 , @entity1 has learned			1
@entity8 has not commented publicly on the need for more troops , but a @entity5 defense official and a senior @entity13 official directly familiar with his thinking and the entire matter have confirmed details to @entity1			1
the proposal for more troops has been briefed to @entity13 officials behind closed doors			0
according to the @entity13 source , it calls for an additional 2,000 troops including at least 750 personnel to serve as trainers for @entity6 forces			1
the trainers specifically would work to teach @entity6 units how to support their operations in the field			0
the balance of the forces would work largely to counter the still significant threat posed by improvised explosive devices ( @entity35 )			0
another @entity13 official tells @entity1 " it 's highly likely " many of the additional forces will be @entity5 troops			1
some @entity13 member countries are politically ambivalent about the war , he noted			0
and practically , it is only @entity5 forces that have the most advanced equipment to counter roadside bombs in may , defense secretary @entity45 sent 850 @entity5 military trainers on a temporary deployment when @entity49 countries could not pledge enough of their own forces			2
this latest need for 2,000 forces goes beyond that to include @entity55 forces , although some small number of the at least 750 additional trainers could replace those already there			2
no final decisions have been made on any additional @entity5 troops			1
@entity13 military authorities are scheduled to meet in the coming days to try to get specific troop commitments from member nations			1
the goal is to get the matter resolved before a november @entity13 summit in which @entity5 and @entity13 military commanders are expected to discuss progress in the war			2
it is not clear whether the new effort will bring the troop levels above the 30,000 additional @entity5 forces authorized by president @entity73 earlier this year , as it will depend on how many troops the @entity13 countries contribute and the potential re-assignment of existing forces			1
the president also authorized the @entity78 at the time to deploy 3,000 forces , but more than half of those 3,000 have already been earmarked			0
@entity13 sources emphasize they believe the bulk of the additional 2,000 will likely have to come from the @entity5			1
the potential for yet another troop increase , even a relatively small one , is already being defended by @entity13			0
the senior official told @entity1 " this relatively small uplift -- less than 2 percent of the 150,000 in theatre from the coalition -- reflects the direction of the campaign : training the @entity6 security forces to prepare for transition , as well as protecting our forces			0
" a @entity5 military official also confirms that in recent weeks the discussion of the " withdrawal " of forces from certain areas of @entity6 beginning in july 2011 has taken a bit of a twist			2
the official said the withdrawal in some areas will signify that those areas may be turned over to @entity6 control , but that may not mean troops will come home			0
the latest options call for taking those troops not needed and sending them to other areas where security is still poor .			0

sources say new troops would include more trainers for @entity6 forces
@entity13 official : " it 's highly likely " many of the additional forces would be @entity5 troops
@entity13 authorities will meet soon to get specific commitments from member nations
