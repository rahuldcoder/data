-- fourteen times in nine years , sgt. 1st class @entity1 had left his family behind and headed out on deployment as an @entity12 , taking part in hundreds of combat missions in @entity8 and @entity9 , all before his 30th birthday			1
his most recent tour turned out to be his last			0
the veteran soldier 's death rattled his commanders , as well as those in his native @entity18			1
his former football coach , @entity19 , remembered @entity1 as diligent , funny , passionate and team - oriented			1
" i told my classes that i was incredibly sad to begin with and incredibly angry , " said @entity19 , who besides being an assistant coach the past 18 years is also a social sciences teacher at @entity22			2
" just the fact that it happened to someone like him -- it 's hard			1
" @entity1 , 1st lt. @entity28 and @entity29 all died saturday in @entity31 province when an improvised explosive device blew up near their assault force , according to a @entity36 news release			1
the trio 's death is far from unprecedented : according to @entity0 's count , based on @entity41 military reports , there have been 1,811 @entity41 troops killed during @entity44 , the @entity41 - led mission in @entity9 that began in october 2001			1
each person , each death , is unique			2
in @entity1 's case , that translates to a man whom his unit commander described as " irreplaceable " -- on the battlefield and in life			1
" he was one of those men who known by all as much for his humor , enthusiasm and loyal friendship as he was for his unparalleled skill and bravery under fire , " said lt. col. @entity53 , head of the @entity55 's 2nd battalion			2
" this was a ranger you wanted at your side when the chips were down			2
" @entity1 distinguished himself as a person as much as he did as a player while in high school , his former coach recalled			1
" he was just a great kid , " @entity19 said , describing his great sense of humor and engaging personality			0
" and we knew , as coaches , that no matter what , this was a kid who was going to play hard and ( all ) out			2
" @entity19 said he was n't surprised when @entity1 told him he was going to enlist			1
" it made all the sense in the world , " the coach said , given @entity1 's proven dedication to and ability to thrive as a member of a team			1
so @entity1 joined the @entity88 in july , a few months after graduating high school and not long before the september 11 terrorist attacks			1
nine months later , he became part of the @entity93 regiment			0
@entity1 was based at that unit 's headquarters at @entity96 in @entity97 , where his role was as a joint terminal attack controller			1
the person in this position often advances into harm 's way , directing allied combat aircraft on where and when to strike			2
his regiment 's commander , col. @entity106 , called @entity1 " technically and tactically competent " as well as critically important			1
" his ability to employ fire support platforms made him a game - changer on the battlefield -- an operator who , in real terms , had the value of an entire strike force on the battlefield , " @entity106 said in the news release			0
the military culture is very much ingrained in the @entity121 culture in which @entity1 grew up			2
much of the @entity122 is based there at @entity41 @entity124			0
a large @entity126 base at @entity127 is about 30 miles northwest of @entity128 , with the famed @entity129 about 11 miles south			0
the parents of many of that high school 's students -- whose enrollment was about 3,000 when @entity1 attended -- are in the military , @entity19 notes			1
yet while multiple students enlist each year , @entity1 's death is the first his coach can recall since @entity128 opened in 1990			1
@entity19 said he 'd kept in touch with his former player since graduation , knowing full well that was in special operations and in harm 's way			0
but he said neither he nor were others in the community was prepared for the news			0
" this was really hard , " @entity19 said			0
" i do n't know if we knew how to deal with it			0
" the thousands of veterans who live in the area know the dangers and trauma of war all too well			0
that 's one reason why they have made it a priority to look out for those now serving overseas , @entity158 said friday from @entity165 in @entity18			0
" the returning troops coming back home the current wars , we give them a group hug , " said @entity158 , an @entity88 veteran who served during the @entity166			2
" we 're right there , and we support them			0
" in @entity1 's case , such support now will be extended to his surviving family			1
he leaves behind his wife , @entity177 , and daughters @entity178 and @entity180 , both of whom now live in @entity182 , @entity97			0
he is also survived by his mother , @entity183 of @entity184 , @entity185 , and his brother , @entity187 of @entity18			0
according to @entity19 , @entity1 never relished the spotlight and probably would not want it now , upon his death			1
but as with other troops who have died in combat , @entity19 said , the recognition is well - deserved			0
" some of this attention would probably bother ( @entity195 ) , because he felt he was a guy doing his job , which he believed in , " the coach said			0
" but these guys are heroes			0

@entity1 was one of 3 killed days *ago* while on a mission in @entity31 province
