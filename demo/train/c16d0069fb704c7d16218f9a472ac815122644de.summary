@entity0 , @entity1 -- for the past few months , i have been trying to figure out why @entity4 is so unlikeable			1
it ca n't be because he 's rich , because there are a lot of rich people we like			1
hell , president @entity11 's rich and 56 % of the country views him favorably			1
it ca n't be because he 's @entity14 , because @entity14 do n't like him either			2
last month , when a woman reportedly asked house speaker @entity16 , " can you make me love @entity4 ? " he said , " no.			2
. the @entity19 people probably are n't going to fall in love with @entity4			1
" the latest @entity2 / @entity21 found that 48 % of @entity19 view him unfavorably , which is n't exactly breaking news because @entity4 's been unable to get much likeability traction since announcing his first run at the @entity27 five years ago			1
for a sex scandal - free politician , that 's got to be a bit perplexing			0
but then last week , the reason for the bad vibes about @entity4 became clear			2
you see , he 's been zipping across the country using president @entity11 's " you did n't build that " quote out of context for an analogy about a student who worked hard in school and made the honor roll			1
he used it again when he introduced his running mate , @entity44 last weekend			0
@entity45 : @entity4 does @entity11 a huge favor what the president said was : " if you were successful , somebody along the line gave you some help			1
there was a great teacher somewhere in your life			0
somebody helped to create this unbelievable @entity19 system that we have that allowed you to thrive			2
somebody invested in roads and bridges			0
if you 've got a business â € ” you did n't build that			0
" he also said , " the point is , is that when we succeed , we succeed because of our individual initiative , but also because we do things together			0
" @entity4 spins it to make it sound as if the president is totally discrediting an individual 's hard work , summing it up this way			1
" i realize that he got to school on a bus and the bus driver got him there , but i do n't give the bus driver credit for the honor roll , " he said			2
" i give the kid credit for the honor roll			0
" nothing 's wrong with that statement by itself			0
the problem is , we do n't live by ourselves			2
this analogy epitomizes what makes @entity4 so unlikeable to so many people , regardless of party , race , gender or socioeconomic status			1
in his mind , the world is full of bus drivers and honor roll students and the two are independent of each other , which is why he can characterize president @entity11 's desire to help those less fortunate as creating a " culture of dependence			1
" what rubs so many people the wrong way is @entity4 's inability to see that society is interdependent			1
there are moments in some of @entity4 's speeches in which he comes across like the guy who does n't wave when you let him into traffic , because in his mind , he was able to merge on his own			1
few people ever like that guy ... and this is why less than 50 % of @entity19 like @entity4			1
opinion : is @entity44 for or against @entity120 ? growing up , i rode the bus to school			0
we only had one car and both my parents had to work			0
so if it was n't for the bus i would have had to attend the neighborhood schools that were within walking distance as opposed to the special schools for high academic achievers that were an hour 's ride away			2
i worked hard to get accepted into the programs			0
i worked to stay there			0
but i would not have been able to do any of those things if it were n't for the bus drivers who made sure i got to school safe and on time			0
when you genuinely live life through a prism of gratitude , you do n't use analogies that minimize the impact others have on your life			0
when you live life through that prism , you do n't see voters and delegates , you do n't see the budget as just a bunch of numbers you have to make work			0
@entity4 does n't irk us because he was born into privilege			1
he irks us because he behaves as if being born into privilege had nothing to do with his success			0
his wife , @entity162 , was supposed to make her husband more appealing			0
now the question is : can @entity44 make @entity4 likeable ? i doubt it			2
when men like @entity44 or @entity11 or vice president @entity170 roll their sleeves up to talk to blue collar voters , it feels real because it 's coming from a real place inside			2
when @entity4 rolls his sleeves up , it 's clear he 's trying to send a message -- because his sense of entitlement and social disconnect prevents him from being the message			1
that does n't mean people wo n't vote for him in november			1
it 's just that they wo n't be doing so because they like him			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity188 : polls show @entity19 favorable on @entity11 , not favorable on @entity4
he says @entity4 's *unpopularity* stems from his sense of entitlement , *disregard* for others
he says @entity4 fails to realize that part of our *strength* is our dependence on each other
@entity188 : @entity4 's likeability problem does n't mean people wo n't vote for his ticket
