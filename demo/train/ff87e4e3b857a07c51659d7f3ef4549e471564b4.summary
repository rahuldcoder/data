-- the earthquake and tsunami in northeastern @entity3 on march 11 last year took an estimated 19,000 lives , caused the evacuation of about 300,000 people , and set off the worst nuclear accident since @entity8			1
the meltdowns of the @entity11 reactors ended @entity3 's plans to produce half of its electricity through nuclear energy			1
flotsam from 2011 @entity3 tsunami reaches @entity18 all of @entity3 's remaining reactors are offline , and experts believe that strong anti-nuclear feelings will keep them from restarting for some time			0
beyond @entity3 's shores , the crisis has pushed @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 to end their commitment to nuclear power			0
@entity11 has given @entity30 nuclear regulators four important lessons given a tendency to downplay the far - reaching consequences of disasters and outdated ways of preparing for them			1
first , we know from multiple disasters that people who live far from predetermined evacuation zones will move themselves and their families to places where they feel safe			2
we saw this during the @entity45 scare when 200,000 people in @entity47 -- far more than the 3,500 people advised to leave -- departed en masse from the area			0
these " shadow " evacuations cause gridlock and delays , impeding the evacuations that are actually necessary			2
many of the evacuees never return			0
about one - fifth of foreigners in @entity3 , many living as far as 180 miles away in @entity58 , have yet to return after the exodus following the @entity11 meltdowns			1
beyond simply relocating in the short term , anxiety about nuclear contamination caused many @entity3 mothers to permanently take their children out of @entity11 prefecture , leaving husbands with local jobs behind			1
policy makers must factor in such behaviors when planning for accidents at nuclear power facilities			2
next , @entity11 illuminated the heart - rending choices faced by first responders to disasters			1
as the scope of the 3/11 disaster became apparent , some @entity78 workers left the site of the nuclear power plant to help their own families flee the disaster			1
we saw a similar situation in @entity87 , when @entity87 police officers evacuated with their families as floodwater rose			0
of course , many first responders put their responsibilities to their communities and their posts ahead of their own self - interest			2
one @entity3 mayor stayed at city hall helping to evacuate others rather than returning to his own home to search for his wife , who had been swept away by the tsunami			0
planners must take into account the impossible choices thrust upon those on the front lines and factor in their own families ' well - being			2
third , @entity11 has underscored the ways in which formal evacuation plans are " fantasy documents			1
" @entity114 of @entity115 pointed out long ago that documents prepared by firms operating complex and potentially hazardous facilities have to turn unknown risks into known risks for their regulators			0
such plans -- which local residents may not read closely if they read them at all -- are produced to ensure that utilities follow the law			0
the @entity127 reactor , not even 35 miles away from downtown @entity128 , runs regular evacuation drills for people who live within 10 miles of the plant			1
but drawing a 10 - mile circle around a nuclear facility on a map does not contain fallout at that boundary			1
many observers protested when a @entity139 official running the country 's nuclear watchdog agency downplayed the consequences of the approaching @entity8 radiation in a tv interview			0
he seemed to imply that the health effects of the radioactive cloud from the may 1986 meltdown had stopped at the border , as if it lacked the proper visa for entry			0
radiation from the @entity11 meltdowns spread to the town of @entity155 , well outside the 20 - mile boundary set up by the @entity3 government			1
all but 100 of the town 's 7,000 residents have since moved out			0
experts continue to debate the size of safe zones in nuclear accidents			0
the @entity164 has agreed to evaluate the possibility of establishing a 50 - mile emergency evacuation zone around nuclear power plants in the @entity30			1
this is because the @entity164 itself recommended that @entity30 citizens in @entity3 evacuate from a 50 - mile zone around the @entity11 reactors soon after the accident			1
past analyses showed that more than half of the population of the @entity30 lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant			1
( check your zip code at this site to see how far you live from one			0
) a 50 - mile zone would require that millions of @entity30 be informed of their possible evacuation in the case of an accident , an outcome which would undoubtedly increase anti-nuclear sentiment			1
finally , the meltdowns in @entity11 have punctured any " 100 % safe " myths that had survived @entity45 and @entity8			2
engineers and planners need to show humility when talking about risks to an ever - more - skeptical public ; this is especially true in highly complex and interconnected nuclear facilities , which @entity196 of @entity197 recognized as susceptible to " normal accidents			2
" for some , nuclear power 's promise of a stable , carbon dioxide - free power source is worth any risks from accidents and the problem of nuclear waste storage			2
for others , @entity11 represents the third accident in an industry that has little room for error			0
we ignore these lessons and underestimate the potential consequences of the next disaster at our peril			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			0

@entity221 : the @entity11 meltdowns *reveal* flaws in nuclear disaster planning
huge evacuations caused gridlock , he says , and first responders left for their families
@entity219 : a 10 - mile evacuation radius is a " fantasy " ; at least a 50 - mile radius is needed
@entity219 : half of @entity30 lives within 50 miles of a plant ; we ca *n't* dismiss the risks
