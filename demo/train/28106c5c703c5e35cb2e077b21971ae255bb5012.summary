-- the @entity4 graduate student infected with rare " flesh - eating " bacteria has proven to be " amazingly resilient , " her father said wednesday , and a second apparent case has been reported			1
" it 's phenomenal the change we 've seen in the past week , " said @entity7 , whose 24 - year - old daughter @entity8 was on a ventilator in intensive care at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
" today , she 's actually doing very well , " he told @entity17 of @entity0 's sister station @entity19			1
" she was in high spirits			2
" the master 's student in psychology at the @entity26 school was with friends on may 1 near the @entity28 , about 50 miles west of @entity29 , when she grabbed onto a zip line			1
it snapped and she fell			0
the accident left a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close			0
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room , where doctors determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh - devouring bacteria @entity42			0
she was flown to @entity12 for surgery			1
since then , doctors have removed part of @entity7 's abdomen , amputated a leg and expect to remove her fingers , her father said			1
" we 're unclear if she actually knows about the leg , " he said			1
" right now , she does know about the condition of her hands , though			0
she knows there has been some atrophy -- or basically a loss of blood flow in that area			0
" the father said there was no immediate need for surgeons to remove her fingers , which he described as being in a state of " dry gangrene ... her fingers basically , at this point , are necrotized			1
it 's dead flesh ; they will ultimately have to be removed			1
" @entity7 , who has been on life support since may 4 , regained consciousness a week later , the school 's website said			1
she has since undergone a tracheotomy			0
" i hope it will be easier to understand her , " said @entity76 's sister @entity75			1
until now , the family has been playing a form of charades in an attempt to decipher her words , which the ventilator 's presence has been made difficult to understand , she said			1
@entity7 has been infused with 177 units of blood since she contracted the infection			1
that 's more than 168 pints ; the average human body contains about 10 pints of blood , according to @entity92			1
the bacteria are " remarkably common in the water and in the environment , " according to dr. @entity94 , an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at @entity96			0
he said it was not clear how many cases occur in the @entity101 in any given year			0
" for pediatrics , we only see two or three a year , " he said , referring to @entity96			0
" when it gets into those deeper tissues , it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition , " he said			0
" when it does that , those tissues die , and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control			0
" the infection is fatal in about one in four cases , the @entity118 says on its website			1
a similar if apparently less severe case was reported by the husband of a 36 - year - old paramedic and nurse from @entity126 , @entity127 , who gave birth to twins on may 7 at a hospital in @entity13			1
the couple had traveled to @entity29 because they had found there a doctor who was willing to perform a vaginal delivery even if the babies were in the breach position			0
some doctors prefer to perform cesarean sections in such cases			0
other than a minor tear that was sewn up and the loss of " a lot of blood " that required a transfusion , @entity142 's vaginal deliveries of twins @entity144 and @entity145 were uneventful , said her husband , @entity152 , a 42 - year - old firefighter			1
but when @entity142 failed to feel better by thursday , she checked out of the @entity29 hospital and traveled back to @entity126			0
" we discharged because we wanted to come home and see if we could get her better , because they could n't figure out what was wrong with her , " het said			0
but once she was home with her babies , @entity142 's condition worsened			2
on friday morning , " she woke up and she had a big bruise on the back of her leg and it looked like a blood clot , " @entity152 said			2
" that spot just got bigger and bigger as she laid there			0
literally , you could almost watch it grow as you 're standing there			0
" he then took his wife to @entity176			0
" one of the @entity179 doctors realized what it kind of looked like , and she went and got the surgeon , and they all made the decision that it was definitely necrotizing fasciitis , so they took her immediately to surgery , " he said			2
by then , the affected tissue " had almost encircled her leg			2
" in separate procedures on friday , saturday and sunday , surgeons cut out dead skin and tissue from both legs to keep the infection from spreading and put her on antibiotics , said @entity142			2
" it 's hopefully on its way to healing , " he said			1
" she 's sedated and on a ventilator			2
" though @entity142 's organs remain in good shape , " they told me it could still go either way , " her husband said			1
still , he added , " she 's critical , but likely she 's going to be ok			2
" @entity208 , the hospital 's public relations officer , could only confirm wednesday night that her condition was critical but stable			2
the two doctors whom @entity152 identified as having treated his wife have not responded to requests for comment			0
meanwhile , infants @entity144 and @entity145 are in the care of family and friends , @entity142 said .			0
