@entity0 -- with defendant @entity4 sitting less than 8 feet away and staring straight ahead , a star government witness in the case against @entity4 explained monday why he turned against the man he long counted among " my partners in crime , my best friends			1
" aging mobster @entity9 said he learned @entity4 was an @entity10 informant , the worst thing you could be in " @entity13 , " a part of @entity0 that prided itself on absolute loyalty			1
" it broke my heart			0
it broke all loyalties , " said @entity9 , his testimony laced with what sounded like sadness			2
late monday night , @entity4 's defense filed a motion requesting that the court inform the jury that @entity9 is a cooperating government witness and is testifying in exchange for a lesser sentence on murder charges			1
@entity9 pleaded guilty to 10 murders in 1999 and later admitted to 20 , so defense attorney @entity30 said the jury should be told to consider @entity9 's testimony with caution			1
prosecutor @entity34 responded tuesday that the defense was " playing games " and said issuing a cautionary instruction mid-testimony would " send a very bad message to the jury			0
" former bookie takes @entity4 trial down memory lane judge @entity43 did not rule on the motion but said she would consider issuing instructions regarding nonspecific witnesses when the jury is read the final charges			1
@entity4 is charged in the deaths of 19 people during the nearly two decades that federal prosecutors say he was the head of the @entity54 mob in @entity0			0
for three decades , @entity9 said , he was tight with @entity4 and @entity4 's partner , @entity55			1
" they were my partners in crime , my best friends , my children 's godfathers , " said the 72 - year - old divorced mobster who now lives on @entity57 and who sold his life story in hopes of getting it made into a movie			0
the men were so close , @entity9 even named his youngest son " @entity69 " after his two friends			0
in a flat , emotionless voice , former hitman @entity9 began to describe some of the murders he said he committed , several of them , he testified , with @entity4 along			1
@entity9 said he was the trigger man while @entity4 was backup to ensure the " hit " was successful			1
in one case , @entity4 used his car to block a target coming out a side street			0
@entity9 , who said he was firing out the back window from another car during the incident , testified that @entity4 " was afraid he was going to get shot because tracer bullets were coming out of the machine gun and flying over his head			1
" " was he angry ? " asked @entity34 , the prosecutor			0
" @entity86 was joking about it , " replied @entity9			0
a ' hands - on killer ? ' @entity9 also described the killings of two brothers after one of them had angered @entity4 's gang			1
one brother was tracked down at a restaurant in @entity97 , @entity98 , and " i shot him in the heart , " @entity9 said			0
when the other brother was killed later , @entity4 and his gang stashed the body in the trunk of a car then drove the car south and dropped it at a housing project in @entity107 where , as he had expected , " a few kids stole the car , " @entity9 said			2
under a plea deal , @entity9 was sentenced to 14 years in prison in exchange for fully testifying against @entity4			2
he served 12 years and was released in 2007			0
his testimony also was crucial against corrupt @entity10 agent @entity114 , who was found guilty in federal court on racketeering and obstruction - of - justice charges , among others			2
@entity114 served 10 years in federal prison and is now doing an additional 40 years in state prison after being found guilty for his role in the murder of @entity124 businessman and former world @entity126 owner @entity125			0
@entity55 , @entity4 's partner , is serving life terms without parole but avoided a possible death sentence by cooperating with federal authorities			2
the connection between @entity4 and @entity114 also was the focus of @entity9 's testimony monday			1
@entity9 said @entity4 grew up in the same @entity0 housing project as @entity114 , who looked up to both @entity4 and his brother @entity137 , who rose to serve as state @entity139 president in @entity98			2
according to @entity9 's testimony , when @entity114 returned to @entity0 as an @entity10 agent , he thanked " @entity142 for " keeping me honest " and told him " if there 's anything i can do ... " @entity145 said , " if you could keep my brother out of trouble , that would be a great help , " according to @entity9			1
@entity9 testified that he , @entity4 and the others agreed that @entity4 would meet with @entity114 and " be a good listener			1
" it was n't long before @entity4 was giving @entity114 money and buying gifts including unset diamonds for @entity114 to give to his fiancee as an engagement present , @entity9 said			2
prosecutors and law enforcement officials say it was the corrupt relationship between @entity4 and @entity114 that allowed @entity4 's criminal enterprise to grow and even facilitated some murders			0
the trial , which enters its fifth day tuesday , is expected to take up to three months and has the potential to reveal sensational details about the mob and @entity10 corruption , especially if @entity4 chooses to testify			1
@entity4 was in hiding for 16 years before he was captured in @entity169 , @entity170 , two years ago , living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment			0
at his july 2011 arraignment , he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts .			0
