the firebrand leader of @entity3 's left - wing @entity2 party appeared to be bracing for a bigger battle as he declared victory in sunday 's election			1
now that his party has apparently won the support of his country 's voters , @entity8 has another fight in front of him : making good on his campaign promise to renegotiate the terms of @entity3 's bailout			1
" we are regaining our lost dignity ... now that we are heard by all of @entity22 , we will fight with the same passion , the same confidence , " @entity8 told cheering supporters			1
" so let 's go and let 's all continue this beautiful and tough fight			0
" with more than 70 % of votes counted , @entity2 was officially projected to win at least 149 seats in the 300 - seat @entity30			1
exit polls also placed the party in the lead			0
but analysts cautioned that it was still too close to call whether @entity2 would win a majority of seats -- a key step that would allow the party to govern without forming a coalition government			1
@entity8 , 40 , who could become @entity3 's next prime minister , also vowed to end austerity measures			1
" @entity3 leaves behind the austerity that ruined it , leaves behind the fear , leaves behind five years of humiliation , and @entity3 moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity , " he told the crowd			1
@entity2 's pledges to try to get some of @entity3 's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate -- even if they potentially jeopardize @entity3 's place in the eurozone			1
the election could lead to a dramatic showdown with the debt - laden nation 's lenders			2
" that is a gamble that people in @entity3 seem to be prepared to take at this point , simply because the terms of its bailout have been so severe , " @entity3 journalist @entity63 told @entity4 on sunday			2
one of those people willing to take the risk is @entity72 , a former public sector employee			0
" people went bankrupt since we entered the bailout , poverty is visible across society , and i believe that hope is coming with @entity2 's program , not only for @entity3 , but for all of @entity22 , " she said ahead of the election			1
the austerity imposed by @entity3 's international creditors has cut deep			1
unemployment has soared to 28 % , and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages , pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back			0
the governing @entity90 had pointed to recent improvements in economic indicators as signs things were getting better			0
after conceding defeat sunday , outgoing prime minister @entity94 said his conscience was clear			0
" i got a country on the verge of ruin			0
i was asked to try and save it , and i did it , " he said			0
" most people did not believe we could stand strong , but we did			0
" now , he said , @entity3 is secure and " slowly walking away from the crisis			2
" " and more than anything , " he said , " i give back a country that is a member of the @entity22 parliament and the euro			0
" in his victory speech sunday , @entity8 noted that @entity3 's election could have an impact far beyond his country 's borders			1
" our victory is , at the same time , it 's a victory for all the people of @entity22 that are fighting against austerity that 's ruining the common @entity22 future , " he said			0
his message is one that has resonated in other southern @entity22 countries under the restrictions of international bailouts			0
@entity2 's victory could boost other populist parties , like @entity131 's anti-euro @entity129 in @entity132 and the @entity133 in @entity134			2
but it 's unclear how its plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out			2
is @entity8 man of the moment ? @entity4 's @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report .			2

" we are regaining our lost dignity , " @entity8 tells cheering supporters :
official projections indicate the left - wing @entity2 party has won at least 149 seats in @entity30
the party has vowed to renegotiate @entity3 's bailout and get some of its debt written off
