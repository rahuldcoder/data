-- @entity1 , especially that sweet spot halfway between @entity3 and @entity4 where small swaths of the legendary old prairies remain , is an earthly paradise			1
@entity8 live oaks spread their heavy limbs beneath cloud - spattered skies , while creeks and rivers — most prominently the meandering @entity14 — ripple alongside gently rolling pastures gilded with waving grasses			2
these natural glories are precisely what led @entity19 and @entity20 to choose the area for their @entity22 , the retreat they completed in 2001 , just after he became the 43rd president of the @entity27			1
occupying some 1,600 acres near the flyspeck town of @entity30 , about 25 miles west of @entity31 , the property is anchored by a strong but relatively modest home that quietly honors its location			1
during the eight years mr. @entity20 was in office , the ranch served as the @entity37 @entity36 and welcomed numerous heads of state — from @entity40 president @entity39 to @entity42 king @entity41 — some of whom were coaxed to join the leader of the free world as he raced along the property 's 40 - mile network of bike trails			1
and , of course , there are the well - known stories of the president spending his vacations clearing brush , often in searing heat , sometimes encouraging aides to join him			2
@entity58 : @entity59 and @entity61 's @entity60 these days the @entity62 live in @entity3 , also home to the @entity64 , which opened last year on the campus of @entity66			1
but they regularly make the trip south to @entity30 , where the former president is just as likely to be found handling a fishing rod or paintbrush as he is a chain saw			1
the ranch remains an essential getaway for the couple , a place to unwind and spend time with their daughters , @entity80 and @entity81 , as well as @entity81 's family , and to entertain close friends like @entity84 and @entity85 , prominent cultural leaders in @entity3			1
in fact , it was @entity89 who helped the @entity62 find their architect , @entity90 , a professor at the @entity91 at @entity4 's @entity92			0
" @entity84 and @entity85 love the way @entity100 buildings , " says mrs. @entity80 , relaxing on a shady terrace that overlooks a shimmering lake where her husband often casts lines for bass			0
( the largest caught to date , the former president reports , was a ten - pounder			0
) " so when we bought this property , @entity84 told me , ' i have your architect , ' and , of course , " she jokes , with a slightly arched eyebrow , " i always do what @entity84 says			0
" ( @entity89 was a member of the committee that selected @entity112 to design the @entity20 center			1
) @entity58 : @entity114 the former first lady notes that when she was growing up in @entity117 , @entity1 , her father built spec houses — " one story and low to the ground , a style you saw a lot in the ' 50s and ' 60s			2
" she and mr. @entity20 had a similar type of residence in mind for @entity30 , mainly , she explains , " because we wanted the house to fit into the landscape			1
" and she means fit literally			0
@entity90 's design carefully nestled a single - level , three - bedroom limestone structure and an adjacent two - suite guesthouse into an almost imperceptible rise amid an existing grove of live oaks and cedar elms			1
wrapped by deep roof overhangs — some up to ten feet wide — that serve to deflect the region 's broiling sunlight and torrential downpours , the dwelling features tall windows that add a romantic transparency to its unpretentious countenance			2
" we wanted to see and enjoy the beauty as much as possible , " says mr. @entity20			1
to answer the couple 's desire for indoor - outdoor living , many of the windows are also doors that open to covered terraces and walks , buffalo - grass lawns , and the tree - shaded swimming pool			2
when the doors are flung wide , the home becomes a veritable pavilion , capturing passing breezes and filled with birdsong			0
the configuration also reduces the need for internal corridors — often the @entity62 navigate the place by strolling out one door and in through another			0
" it 's slightly motel - ish , but we love that , " mrs. @entity80 says lightheartedly			2
@entity58 : @entity172 's @entity171 @entity170 the former first lady worked closely on the project with @entity90 , who found her to be a highly perceptive accomplice			0
" she has a lot of experience from seeing the carefully organized houses that her dad built , and she has a very , very good eye , " he says			0
early in the construction process mrs. @entity80 pointed out that the masons ' work on the @entity184 limestone that clads the exterior ( and some interior ) walls of the residence was absolutely perfect — and thoroughly wrong			0
the @entity62 wanted to have a subtly rustic , handcrafted look , and @entity90 had deliberately chosen to use the so - called rough - back pieces that were traditionally thrown away in the trimming process rather than smoothly finished blocks			0
" we had to take away their levels , " the architect recalls , adding that the stone was relaid the old - fashioned , slightly irregular way , with taut string and appraising eyes			0
@entity58 : @entity200 an advocate of sustainable design , @entity90 incorporated into the compound a number of green features , including a geothermal energy system for heating and cooling			1
@entity209 runs off the house 's standing - seam metal roof and into a gravel - filled moat , where it filters into a 42,000 - gallon cistern concealed beneath the rear terrace and is recycled to irrigate the lawns			2

during @entity20 's presidency , world leaders visited his @entity1 ranch
the @entity20 family regularly makes the trip from big - city @entity3 to small - town @entity30
mr. @entity20 frequently fishes and paints to unwind on the ranch
the design 's green features include a geothermal energy system for heating and cooling
