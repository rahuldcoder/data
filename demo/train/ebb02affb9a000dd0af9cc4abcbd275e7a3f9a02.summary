-- when president @entity2 commented that the @entity3 were standing around drinking slurpees while the @entity5 were busy creating real change in @entity7 , it caused quite a storm			0
now that he 's sitting down with the new @entity3 leadership this week , the so - called " @entity13 " is the talk of the nation			1
while most of us have had one of @entity18 's frozen concoctions , there 's plenty more you probably do n't know about this too cool drink			1
a @entity21 like so many great inventions , the slurpee was created by accident			1
in the late - 1950s , @entity25 of @entity26 owned an old @entity28 whose machinery was always breaking down			1
when his soda fountain went out , he improvised by putting some bottles in the freezer to stay cool			0
however , when he popped the top , they were a little frozen and slushy			0
folks loved them and started requesting " those pops that were in a little bit longer			0
" realizing he had a surprise hit on his hands , @entity25 built a machine in the back room using the air conditioning unit from a car that would create slushy soda by combining and freezing a flavor mix , water , and carbon dioxide to make it fizz			1
he held a " name the product " contest and the winning entry was " icee			0
" with help from an engineering and manufacturing company in @entity56 , the icee machine was redesigned and sold to a few convenience stores throughout the early 1960s			2
but things really took off when , in 1965 , @entity18 licensed the machine , but called the drink by a different name to make it unique for their stores			1
the name slurpee was coined by @entity67 , a @entity18 ad agency director , when he described the sound made while sipping it through a straw			1
@entity0 : 10 secret menu items at fast food restaurants kids love ' em thanks to inventive advertising aimed at the growing youth market , @entity74 were an instant hit with the @entity80 generation			0
the cups featured colorful , almost psychedelic designs , and the flavors -- " @entity84 , " " for adults only , " and " @entity86 , @entity87 " -- were edgy for the time			1
@entity18 ads were so popular that radio djs were getting call - in requests for @entity93 commercials			1
one 1970 campaign featured a full - length song , " dance the slurp , " written by one of the founding fathers of radio jingles , @entity96			2
it was released on free , promotional 45 rpm records available in @entity18 stores			1
the catchy little tune was a huge hit at the time and its influence even extended into the late - 1990s , when turntablists cut chemist and @entity108 used the song as the inspiration for their 1999 album , @entity112			1
because so few copies of the giveaway album still exist , copies of " @entity113 " regularly go for as much as $ 50 on @entity117			0
in the 1970s , @entity18 started selling special cups with images of sports stars , comic book characters , early video games , and even rock bands			1
the cups kept kids coming back to complete the entire collection			0
later , limited edition @entity74 flavors started accompanying the cups to create a complete marketing package			2
this is a tradition has continued today through promotional tie - ins with video games , professional wrestling , and extreme sports			2
in recent years , @entity74 have come in annual summer movie cups and flavors			1
dating back to 2002 , when the tie - in for " @entity142 " was a blackberry drink , the promo cups and flavors have grown more and more elaborate ( and popular )			1
the biggest hit so far has been the " @entity146 " franchise , with special collector 's cups that feature @entity150 character designs and a special helmet dome lid			2
they 've been sold on @entity117 for three times what they originally sold for in the store			0
however , for " the @entity159 's " movie in 2007 , they went beyond just redesigned cups and wacky flavors			1
@entity164 were converted to look inside and out like @entity165 , the @entity18 parody on the show , complete with " squishees , " the cartoon world 's version of the slurpee			1
the tie - in flavor that summer was @entity171 , probably one of @entity173 's favorites			2
@entity0 : sex ! drugs ! racism ! 8 controversial candies the @entity178 you 'd think the last thing @entity181 would want is a frozen drink			0
but since 1999 , @entity183 has been crowned the @entity184 with more than 188,833 @entity74 sold there every month			0
with a population of just over 675,000 people , that means over a quarter of the population enjoys a slurpee on a regular basis			2
the rest of @entity181 pales in comparison , selling only 179,900 @entity74 every month			0
@entity194 sells the most cups of any @entity197 metro area , but the largest single slurpee - selling store in the @entity197 is the one in @entity199 , @entity7 , which locals have dubbed " the @entity178			2
" overall , @entity201 sip almost 13 million slurpee drinks every month			2
and since 1966 , close to 6.5 billion slurpee drinks have been sold , enough to almost fulfill your dreams of buying the world a ( frozen ) @entity207			2
happy birthday to @entity197 every year since 2002 , on july 11 ( that 's 7/11 , of course ) , the company celebrates its birthday with " @entity18 day			1
" only in this case , the customers get the present -- free 7.11 - ounce @entity74 for the first 1,000 people through the door of participating stores			0
it 's estimated that the company gives away over 5,000,000 @entity74 to happy customers on this one day			0
but is it kosher ? in case you were wondering , almost all @entity74 flavors are considered kosher pareve ( food that is neither meat nor dairy )			0
there are a few , such as @entity230 and the @entity231 mixes , that are considered kosher dairy ( due to the chemical tagatose in the artificial sweetener ) , while others , like the popular @entity237 drink , are not certified at all			0
some @entity18 stores get the machines themselves certified kosher , which the store owners use as a selling point for their @entity244 customers			2
mixology as any regular @entity93 fan knows , one of the best parts about the self - serve drink is being able to mix flavors from different dispensers			1
according to @entity93 market research , 41 percent of slurpers never mix their flavors , 37 percent always do , and 21 percent will mix every once in a while			1
the most popular combinations use the @entity207 flavor as a base , with a fruity mix on top -- often @entity260 or @entity237			0
but of course for the really daring , there 's always the " @entity93 " -- mixing a little bit of every flavor from the row of dispensers			1
no @entity267 some of the wilder slurpee flavors on tap have been @entity270 , @entity271 ( a tie - in with @entity273 ) , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , and @entity280 ( a tie - in with @entity282 )			1
most of these and other wild and wacky flavors sound like they could come from a factory run by a guy named @entity287			0
but in fact , most are the invention of the mad scientists at the @entity291 in @entity292 , @entity293			0
( yes , they make @entity296 and @entity291 flavors , too )			0
@entity0 : unusual flavors of 10 familiar treats to create a new @entity93 flavor requires a savvy combination of science , senses , and marketing			1
one of their biggest challenges is keeping up on flavor trends , such as knowing that exotic fruits like acai , yumberry , litchi , and dragon fruit are becoming popular with consumers ; whereas previously hot flavors , like mango and pomegranate , are now commonplace			0
of course just because it 's popular does n't necessarily mean it will taste good			0
they go through numerous rounds of product testing until they get the flavor just right			0
but once they 've locked down the taste , they have to consider the name , the color , and the consistency of the mix when it 's cooled to the standard 28 Â° @entity329			2
the process can take weeks or even months to go from concept to your corner store			0
purple for the people for the upcoming @entity13 , @entity18 has offered to provide symbolic @entity74 -- red for @entity3 , blue for @entity338 , and a new flavor , " @entity340 , " which combines the two colors			2
so far , their offer has not been accepted , but some in the @entity344 say the drinks could still make an appearance			0
regardless , the pending sit - down has been reason enough for @entity18 to launch a massive promotional campaign in the form of the @entity351 , a cross-country trek from @entity18 's @entity56 headquarters to the nation 's capital , giving away free samples of their new purple drink to @entity93 fans along the way			1
this is n't the first time @entity18 has gone political			1
since the 2000 presidential election , the company has run a promotion called " 7 - election , " where customers vote by purchasing special red or blue coffee cups printed with each candidate 's name			1
the cups are scanned at check - out and automatically entered in this unscientific , but surprisingly accurate poll -- in 2000 and 2004 , the number of coffee cup votes and the number of actual popular votes for both candidates was only off by 1 or 2 percentage points			0
while 2008 's 7 - elections results were still correct , they gave the election to @entity2 by a landslide -- 60 percent to 40 percent -- when the margin was really only about 7 percent			1
