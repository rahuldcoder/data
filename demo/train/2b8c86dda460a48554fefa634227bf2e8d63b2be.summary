-- how do you imagine the computer of the future ? in movies like " @entity6 " and " minority report , " characters reach out and move virtual objects around in midair with their hands , sending windows and images sailing through @entity14 without touching a keyboard or controller			1
that future is now here			0
the new @entity19 controller , which starts shipping preorders monday and costs $ 80 , is the first commercial gadget that will bring some of that @entity23 magic to laptops and desktops			1
the screen is still two - dimensional for now , but fingers and hands are free to poke , grab and flick in @entity14 to move through applications			0
the device will go on sale at @entity33 on july 28			1
@entity0 tested out the new controller to get a taste of this touch - free future			2
( full disclosure : last month we named @entity19 as one of our 10 startups to watch for 2013			1
) here are our impressions : motion detection motion - detection sensors are presumed to be the next big input device for computers , complementing existing input technology like the mouse , keyboard , touchscreen and voice control			1
the @entity19 controller follows in the footsteps of the @entity53			1
but where the @entity53 tracks large movements for the entire body , the leap is meant for small , subtle hand movements made close to the screen			1
leap says its technology can track precise movements to within one - hundredth of a millimeter			2
optimally , the leap controller sits about an inch in front of the keyboard , lined up with the middle of the computer screen			1
its sensors can pick up movement as far as 2 feet up in the air and 2 feet out from each side of the device , creating an invisible oblong field for moving your hands around			1
the @entity80 - and @entity79 - compatible controller plugs into a usb port and is remarkably small -- close in size to a pack of gum			2
the half - inch - high and 3 - inch - long rectangle is also impressively light , weighing in at a tenth of a pound			0
the device is n't just a another way to nudge a cursor around or input data			2
" our philosophy is not that the leap is intended to replace the mouse and keyboard , " said @entity92 , @entity19 's co-founder and ceo			1
he says the leap controller can tap into a new way of working with applications that is richer than existing methods , but will never be a more efficient way to do certain tasks , like enter data into a spreadsheet			2
" the leap is not binary , " he said			0
" the mouse can only be clicking or not clicking			0
" leap has been working with developers to create apps specifically for the controller			1
the @entity19 apps are cordoned off in their own launch application , called @entity115			1
to buy new apps , you are taken to the web - based airspace store where they are sorted by category or platform			2
there are a few professional apps , lots of casual games , tools for learning a new instrument like a harp or piano , and educational programs			2
most are platform agnostic , but about 30 % are only for @entity79 or @entity80 @entity79 users can install unlock , which lets you unlock your computer by waving your hand above the controller			1
it recognizes your unique hand shape and uses it as a password			2
drawbacks using the leap to navigate this added dimension has its challenges			0
gestures are not unified across all apps			1
scrolling might be a forward circular motion with a single finger in one app , and left to right in another			2
apps include instructions , but getting the feel for each one takes time			1
the leap works best when your hands are parallel to the desk			0
if a hand is too vertical , the sensors ca n't pick out individual fingers			1
the leap sensors are extremely sensitive			1
this is great for when you want to make small precise movements , but maddeningly finicky when you 're just trying to do something simple like select a button			1
in the app @entity170 , pinning a virtual amphibian to a table to dissect it requires a steady hand			2
keeping your arms and hands very still -- a requirement in many programs to select something on the screen -- is harder and more tiring than it looks			0
leap suggests using the device with your elbows propped on the desk			0
when you are in the zone in an app -- having mastered where your hands need to be and how much movement is just enough -- the tracking can be incredibly accurate and the results impressive			0
this is best demonstrated in creative apps that help users make music or art. it 's also fun for zipping through the universe in your own private planetarium using the @entity197 app. the effort it takes to make an app decipher your @entity202 movements can make some tasks more difficult , not less			1
take the clean , simple @entity205 app for @entity19			1
the app shows one row of articles and a few simple gestures for selecting and scrolling through them			0
it takes practice to get the hang of it , and even once you do , the experience is halting			1
sometimes you 'll send the queue racing off in the wrong direction			0
other times you 'll wonder why your article - closing hand wave is n't being picked up by the controller			2
the @entity205 app hits on a common issue with many of these early leap applications : using 3 - d gestures does n't improve on many experiences			0
reading the @entity205 , playing " @entity228 " and dissecting a digital frog would all be more satisfying experiences on a touchscreen device ( or , for the latter , on an actual frog )			0
a promising future despite these limitations , the leap technology has a bright future			0
developers are working on new apps and on integrating leap support into existing ones -- the @entity243 app is an early example			0
another app called @entity246 attempts to bring leap controls to regular @entity80 and @entity79 actions			0
@entity92 said that while the company has been focusing on this controller for now , the hardware is small enough to be built into mobile devices like a tablet			0
working directly with an equipment manufacturer could result in a more controlled and consistent experience			0
the @entity19 controller is a promising foray into desktop @entity14 gesture control			1
the technology feels like the rough first draft of something that will grow more polished over time			0
it 's still young , and will hopefully improve as developers pinpoint the best ways to use it			0
the leap is a curiosity worth watching			0
but for now , do n't ditch your keyboard and mouse .			0

@entity19 controller lets you manipulate computer apps with hand gestures
using motion sensors , the controller detects your hand movements 2 feet away
navigating with @entity19 takes practice as the device can be maddeningly sensitive
the controller costs $ 80 and will be available at @entity33 starting july 28
