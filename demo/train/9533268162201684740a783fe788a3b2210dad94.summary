-- " carrying bottled water is on its way to being as cool as smoking while pregnant , " claims the video " @entity1 , " which debuted on @entity2 last month and garnered more than 450,000 views			1
is it true ? are liters of @entity9 now beyond the pale ? is @entity11 déclassé ? has bottled water become the new eco-no - no ? not quite yet			1
though water sales have seen a recent downturn , plenty of folks are still paying for their daily hydration			2
in fact , @entity20 's video points out , @entity18 buy more than 500 million bottles of the stuff every week			1
it 's second only to soda in popularity , and some industry analysts believe that by next year water will become the most - purchased beverage in the country			2
she wants to redirect the flow of water			0
the bottled water companies , the video insists , are " scaring us , seducing us , misleading us " into buying their products			1
@entity39 , the writer and narrator , gives plenty of reasons why more and more people want to " take back the tap			0
" but the @entity45 accuses the video of " numerous false and misleading statements			0
" " ' @entity1 ' takes a very cynical view of the intelligence of consumers by depicting them as being dupes and victims of industry , " said @entity48 , @entity45 's vice president of communications			2
" we think the opposite ; that consumers are really quite thoughtful in selecting and enjoying a safe , healthy , convenient , calorie - free beverage that 's delicious , refreshing and a very smart drink choice			1
" however , @entity39 argues that not only does tap water often beat out bottled in blind taste tests , but bottled is often less regulated than tap			1
tap water is monitored by the @entity64 , whose standards are generally stricter than the @entity67 , which oversees most bottled - water sales			1
also , she says , tap water is certainly cheaper -- thousands of times cheaper			1
not to mention that some of the best - selling bottled waters -- @entity75 's @entity74 and @entity76 's @entity11 among them -- are , actually , nothing but filtered tap water			1
the companies have spelled this out on labels after pressure from the consumer watchdog group @entity83			0
add the fact that , according to @entity39 , the amount of petroleum used to make water bottles every year is " enough to fuel a million cars " and that 80 percent of supposedly recyclable plastic bottles end up in landfills , you have the makings a ecological crusade			1
@entity45 counters on its website that bottled water containers are 100 percent recyclable and the bottles are " the nation 's most recycled plastic container			1
" to back up its claims , the organization put its own video " @entity102 " on @entity2			2
the bottle backlash has been bubbling up for a while			0
tapping into civic pride what the video calls " one of the dumbest moves in advertising history " happened back in 2006			0
high - end brand @entity111 started a campaign intended to tout its expensively - imported - from - the - tropics water			0
" the label says @entity111 because it 's not bottled in @entity121 , " read the copy in a series of glossy magazine ads. this did not sit well with the good people of @entity121 , @entity122 , who were rather proud of their city 's tap water			1
@entity129 director @entity128 had the local water tested against the pricey bottled stuff			2
@entity111 water had 6.31 micrograms of arsenic per liter ; the city tap had zero			2
the company disputed the findings , but the first major battle of the water wars left @entity111 looking less than pure			0
thou shalt not bottle initial organized resistance to the bottled water industry came not from the usual urban green crowd , but from @entity144 groups			1
in 2006 , members of the @entity146 pledged to avoid bottled water unless absolutely necessary			1
later that year , the @entity148 partnered with the @entity149 to produce a documentary , " @entity154 , " about the ethics of water use , which aired on @entity153			0
for many progressive people of faith , the very idea of privatizing water -- profiting from a shared natural resource -- is abhorrent			0
bottled water is not just bad for the environment ; to some , it 's a sin			1
restaurants follow suit since @entity165 started marketing its mineral water as a luxury item in the 1970s , @entity18 restaurants have made a point of offering customers bottled water with their meals			1
but then famed @entity173 chef @entity172 banned bottled water at her restaurant , @entity176 , in 2006			2
the next year she started serving patrons home - engineered sparkling water			0
other @entity180 restaurants followed suit , and the idea made its way to @entity184 , where celebrity chef @entity186 's fanciest joint , @entity187 , banned the bottle			0
the idea became fashionable enough that a 2007 article in the online magazine @entity190 talked about the " reverse snob appeal " of tap water			2
bottle bans a growing number of schools have active anti-bottled water movements			0
@entity197 in @entity198 , @entity199 , was probably the first college to ban all bottled water sales on campus , back at the beginning of 2009 ; the @entity203 did the same a few months ago			2
similar bans are being discussed at @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 , among other schools			0
local governments are also getting into the act			0
@entity211 , @entity173 , mayor @entity212 was a pioneer , forbidding the use of city money to buy bottled water back in 2007			1
@entity217 , @entity218 , followed suit the next year			0
during the recent @entity222 , @entity220 , @entity221 , started a campaign to encourage visitors to choose free local water over the bottle -- even though @entity11 bottler @entity76 was a sponsor of the @entity222			0
bottles under a microscope journalist @entity230 has turned into a hero -- and a best - selling author -- with his eco-conscious explorations of the food system ; @entity235 found fame with his anti-fast food documentary " @entity238			0
" might bottled water be the new frontier in activist journalism ? reporter @entity242 was ahead of the curve with her 2008 book " @entity249 , " a look at the people and economies behind the water industry			1
environmental scientist @entity250 has just published " bottled and sold : the story behind our obsession with @entity254 , " which includes more than 100 bottled water recalls on everything from mold contamination to algae , bacteria , glass particles and -- believe or not -- crickets			1
meanwhile " tapped , " a new feature - length documentary by @entity267 , has been screening the country with a " @entity264 " tour			0
greener bottles bottled water companies have n't simply ignored all the criticism			1
the @entity272 company , which bottles several brands of water , issued a study pointing out that water has a lower environmental impact than sports drinks and other beverages			2
both @entity76 's @entity11 and @entity75 's @entity74 have introduced new bottles that are supposedly " greener " than those used before			2
and @entity111 maintains charitable and ecological campaigns to highlight the company 's awareness			0
" @entity291 " is the view of many in the environmental movement , who believe that this is all nothing but pr spin .			0
