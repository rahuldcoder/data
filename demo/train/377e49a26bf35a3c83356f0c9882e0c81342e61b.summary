-- after five years of trying , an international group of authors have achieved their aim of taking their @entity4 to @entity5 for the first time			1
the annual traveling festival , known as @entity4 , was set up in 2008 to bring book readings and cultural events to @entity10 who otherwise had little access to the outside world			1
each year the literary festival has visited several cities in the @entity15 , but has been unable to gain permission from @entity17 to visit @entity5			1
@entity17 imposed an economic blockade of @entity5 when @entity19 took over in 2007 , which it says is needed to stop the transit of weaponry to be used by militants in attacks on @entity17 this year , the group of 37 writers , artists and community organizers applied instead to enter @entity5 from @entity28 through the @entity30 crossing , which re-opened last year			1
after a two - week wait , they were granted permission from the @entity28 @entity34 to enter @entity5			1
also on inside the @entity35 : @entity5 music students find smart ways around travel ban " we did n't know if we would get in until the very last minute , " said @entity39 , a @entity41 @entity40 author who traveled with @entity4			1
" we did n't know if we would manage until we actually crossed the border			2
" the group included @entity10 living in @entity44 , @entity15 and around the world , and prominent @entity47 authors including @entity28 @entity48 and @entity49			1
none of them had been to @entity5 before			1
they spent five days in @entity5 from may 5 - 9 , running workshops for university students , free public events and visiting refugee camps			1
also on inside the @entity35 : @entity58 artist inspired by @entity60 shoe thrower the 10 - piece @entity28 band @entity61 , which became well - known for playing in @entity63 during the @entity28 revolution , played its first concert in @entity5 to a packed hall			1
@entity68 @entity67 , an independent filmmaker and founder of @entity4 , said : " coming to @entity5 was a necessity			1
we have tried every year but always failed before			2
everything was incomplete until we came			2
" it was vital to come here because of the fact that it 's so divided and considered a separate entity , but at the same time totally connected to the @entity15			1
" in total around 2,000 @entity77 attended the @entity4 events			2
in one event , each author had 10 minutes to give the message they had always wanted to say to @entity77			0
@entity67 added : " it 's been pretty overwhelming			0
everyone is so welcoming and pleased that we have managed to get there			0
" they are very frustrated by the lack of access to the outside world			0
it 's been a very emotional trip , but overwhelmingly positive			0
" we began @entity4 as an attempt to help connect @entity95 with the rest of the world			2
lack of access to art , culture and education is a form of restriction			0
" we wanted to do what we could to support cultural life in @entity95 , and to put on a festival that would be taken for granted anywhere else			2
" @entity4 collected more than 1,500 books -- including copies of an anthology of extracts from works by festival participants -- which were distributed to cultural centers and university libraries			1
also on inside the @entity35 : unspoiled island sanctuary caught on camera @entity39 said : " there was a real thirst for any books they could get their hands on : poetry , contemporary novels , books about history and politics			0
it 's hard for people and institutions to get enough books and resources			0
" they are hungry for any kind of cultural life , as there are no cinemas and few concerts			0
" he added : " the most important thing has been meeting people and talking on a cultural level , to hear about their experiences and their isolation			0
" we have driven up and down the country and have tried to get as broad a picture as possible of what it 's like to live here			0
i did n't come to lecture people about my literature , but to find out what their experiences are			0
" palfest organizers said that on wednesday evening the closing event was shut down by the police , but added that police later apologized for the incident , saying it was an " individual error			0
" @entity4 is supported by organizations including the @entity41 @entity158 and the @entity159			2
its patrons including @entity162 novelist @entity161 , @entity41 author @entity163 and @entity41 actor @entity164			0
