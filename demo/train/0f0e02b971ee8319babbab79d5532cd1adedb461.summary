back - dated prescriptions and tipoffs to coming tests			1
former teammates of cycling superstar @entity8 recounted a wide range of techniques used to beat the sport 's drug - testing regimen to investigators from the @entity14 , which released its findings on the seven - time @entity17 winner wednesday			1
but perhaps the most effective one was the most low - tech : laying low			0
" we hid , " the report quotes former @entity23 team member @entity22			1
" at the time , the whereabouts programs of drug testing agencies were not very robust			2
" the sport 's international governing body , the @entity29 , " did not even have an out of competition testing program			0
if a tester did show up , you typically would not get a missed test even if you decided not to answer the door			0
in any case , there was no penalty until you had missed three tests			0
so , avoiding testing was just one more way we gamed the system			0
" highlights of the @entity8 report the team 's staff " was good at being able to predict when riders would be tested and seemed to have inside information about the testing , " states the nearly 200 - page decision , which was backed by hundreds of pages of supporting documents			1
during @entity8 's comeback attempt in 2009 , his @entity58 team " benefited from privileged information or timing advantages during doping control tests			1
" and in 2010 , @entity8 himself " was providing untimely and incomplete whereabouts information to @entity14 , thereby making it more difficult to locate him for out of competition testing			2
" @entity8 has consistently denied doping accusations , and his lawyer called the @entity14 probe a " witch hunt " wednesday			1
but he has stopped contesting the allegations , and he faces being stripped of his titles			0
the riders also told of timing their use of erythropoietin , or @entity74 , which boosts the number of red blood cells that carry oxygen to the muscles , to avoid detection			2
the substance was undetectable before 2000 and currently can be detected only for a short time			0
the riders cut that time further by injecting it into a vein rather than under the skin , meaning it would be gone " in a matter of hours			0
" evidence of @entity8 doping ' overwhelming , ' agency says they used testosterone in much the same way , taking small doses at night so that they could pass a drug test the following morning			1
and they also had infusions of saline solution before a test , which throws off a test that measures red blood cell concentration			0
that sometimes required fancy footwork , and there were some close calls , the riders said			0
during the 1998 world cycling championships , a @entity29 tester showed up unannounced and started setting up at a bed and breakfast where @entity8 's team was staying			2
a team doctor went outside to their car , retrieved a bottle of saline " and smuggled it right past the @entity29 tester and into @entity8 's bedroom , " the report states			1
teammate @entity120 told investigators that they later " had a good laugh about how he had been able to smuggle in saline and administer it to @entity8 essentially under the @entity29 inspector 's nose			1
" @entity8 : it 's time to move forward @entity0 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			2

" we hid " from drug tests , cyclist @entity22 told doping investigators
tipoffs and timing helped conceal drug use as well , report finds
