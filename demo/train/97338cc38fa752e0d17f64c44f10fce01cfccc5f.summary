-- the @entity1 has gotten so big it 's outgrown the trusty old television			1
today 's fans can enjoy the bloated spectacle on computers , mobile devices , @entity7 and more			1
for most , crowding around a tv with salty snacks , cold beer and good friends is still the classic way to experience @entity14 's biggest sports event			0
@entity15 has secured exclusive @entity14 broadcast rights to the game , with the telecast beginning officially at 6 p.m. et sunday , although pre-game coverage will start four hours earlier			2
@entity15 is adding a splash of high - tech wizardry to this year 's event -- being played outdoors in chilly northern @entity23 -- with infrared cameras that will show the players ' body temperatures			0
you can employ your own tech tools to enhance the @entity1 viewing experience -- especially if you ca n't get near a tv set			1
here 's a tech primer to enjoying sunday 's festivities : stream the game online both @entity34 and @entity35 will direct viewers to @entity15 's live stream of the game , hosted by @entity38			1
the @entity40 website and @entity42 app will have a free stream of coverage available to any viewers on a computer or @entity42 in the @entity14 , starting sunday morning at @entity47 and ending at 3am monday morning			1
outside of that 27 - hour window , only people who already pay for cable with a select group of providers ( @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 ) can tune in using the service			2
if you 're on an @entity62 tablet , there is no app for streaming the game , but you can attempt to view it through the @entity38 site in a browser			2
interestingly , if you are in @entity68 , you wo n't be able to view live streams of the game			1
officials said they will block live streaming over @entity72 and cellular networks in the @entity74 , @entity23 , stadium because it eats up too much bandwidth			2
watch it on ( some ) smartphones @entity15 and the @entity34 have made some interesting distinctions between smartphones , tablets and computers			0
while you can stream the game through the @entity38 website on a computer and tune in with the mobile app on an @entity42 , you ca n't do the same on a smartphone			1
the @entity34 is streaming the game through its official smartphone apps , but there are a couple of catches			2
to see the game live on a smartphone you have to be a @entity94 customer and also pay $ 5 a month for the premium features			1
the free app is available for @entity62 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity100 devices and will show scores and push custom alerts to people who are n't premium subscribers			1
if you try to work around the system by visiting the @entity38 site from a web browser on your smartphone , it will automatically redirect you to a landing page for the app. @entity34 to block mobile video streaming follow along on social media if you are more interested in crackling social commentary than in @entity116 's play - by - play call , tune into @entity7 , @entity118 or @entity119 for banter , smack talk and memes			1
the official @entity1 @entity7 account , @ @entity1 , is already posting news , photos and weather updates			1
the event 's official hashtag is # sb48 , but you can also follow @entity130 or # @entity131 ( or # @entity132 or # 12thman )			0
check this @entity7 blog post for more examples and suggestions			0
both teams have official @entity118 accounts ( @entity130 , @entity131 ) , and the same hashtags will apply			0
you also may want to follow @ @entity34 , @ @entity139 or such outspoken players as the @entity130 ' @entity141 or the @entity131 ' @entity142			0
the @entity34 is blocking live streaming inside the stadium in part to make it easier for attendees to share photos and commentary			1
let 's hope that will mean lots of real - time , insider updates from the sidelines and stands			0
listen instead of watch if you 're in a place where you ca n't watch the game -- say , at work -- but can wear discreet earbuds , @entity15 has two official options for listening			2

it will be blocked on smartphones , however			0

or , you know , dust off a radio			0
17 things in @entity180 's @entity1 lineup pricey ads and puppies for many viewers the game is just filler between splashy commercials , the halftime show ( it 's @entity188 this year ) and clever counterprogramming on other channels			1
many of the best ads are already online , where companies try to make their multimillion - dollar pitches go viral			0
you can see which brands are planning big ads and get updates as they air , on @entity199 , which follows @entity1 commercials like @entity201 does sports			2
@entity7 also is a good starting point to follow ads. and @entity205 is turning the ads into a competition with its @entity209 site			0
@entity205 will post the commercials shortly after they air and ask people to vote on their favorites			0
fans of the @entity214 , @entity216 's annual celebration of canine cuteness , can tune in beginning at 3 p.m. et sunday to get their doggie fix			0
