-- @entity2 quarterback @entity1 was fined $ 50,000 wednesday by the @entity3 for failing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he sent sexually explicit texts to a @entity8 hostess			1
but @entity3 commissioner @entity13 , citing a lack of evidence , " could not conclude that @entity1 violated league policies relating to workplace conduct , " the league said in a statement			1
the @entity3 was unable to establish whether @entity1 sent objectionable messages to @entity8 game - day hostess @entity17 in 2008 , when he played quarterback for the @entity8			1
he joined the @entity2 in 2009			0
the league also found no evidence to contradict assertions by @entity1 and @entity17 that they never even met in person			2
but @entity13 determined that " @entity1 was not candid in several respects during the investigation , resulting in a longer review and additional negative public attention for @entity1 , @entity17 , and the @entity3 , " the league said			1
the @entity3 had expanded its investigation to look into a second media report alleging further misconduct by @entity1 with other women who worked at the @entity8 ' facility during the 2008 season			1
" misconduct by @entity1 regarding that claim was unable to be substantiated because individuals with potentially relevant information declined to be interviewed or otherwise cooperate with the investigation , " the league said			1
@entity13 has told @entity1 that if the investigation found a violation of the league 's workplace conduct policies , the commissioner would have imposed a " substantially " bigger penalty			1
the league said it does n't judge private conduct or personal relationships except where that conduct or those relationships raise issues under the law or league policies			0
in the allegations involving @entity17 , the @entity3 reviewed public reports , its interviews with several individuals including @entity17 and @entity1 , communications between the two and an independent forensic analysis of electronically - stored material			1
" the investigation was limited in several respects because the conduct occurred in 2008 but was not brought to our attention until this fall			0
as a result , certain records and individuals were unavailable to the @entity3 , " the @entity3 said in a statement			0
the overall investigation took longer than expected because the league had trouble arranging interviews with key individuals and a lot of time was needed to gather stored electronic records , the league said			0
@entity13 also decided to meet personally with @entity1 and @entity17 , which added more time to the inquiry , the league said			2
there was no evidence to suggest that @entity17 engaged in any inappropriate conduct , according to the statement			0
@entity13 used the occasion wednesday to remind all @entity3 teams about improper or unlawful conduct in the workplace			2
" every member of every club 's staff should be able to work in an environment free of harassment or hostility , and one in which every employee is valued , respected , and given a full opportunity to contribute to the goals of the club and the @entity3 , " @entity13 said in the league statement			2
" our new training program on workplace conduct will help all of us to promote the right kind of environment for all employees and i intend to dedicate the fine i have imposed on @entity1 to help fund that training program			0
" @entity0 's @entity115 contributed to this report .			0
