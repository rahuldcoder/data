calling it a " good - faith effort " to help the @entity5 people , @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 released $ 250 million in economic aid sunday , with a pledge of more if president @entity9 implements economic and political reforms			1
@entity0 's announcement came after a series of weekend meetings in @entity13 with a cross-section of @entity5 and a two - hour session with @entity9 on sunday			1
" when @entity5 takes the difficult steps to strengthen its economy and build political unity and justice , we will work with our @entity23 at home on additional support , " @entity0 said in a written statement on the talks			2
but right now , @entity0 said , @entity5 needs help			2
" in light of @entity5 's extreme needs " and assurances by @entity9 that he will take the steps necessary to obtain a major loan package from the @entity34 , @entity0 said the @entity1 would provide the first $ 190 million of $ 450 million in already - promised support funds to the @entity5 government budget			1
in addition , @entity0 said , the @entity1 will provide $ 60 million in direct support for an @entity37 geared toward @entity5 's entrepreneurs and fund a higher - education initiative to help students , especially women , earn undergraduate degrees in science , technology , engineering and business			1
@entity0 said he was banking on @entity9 's assurances that he would implement " homegrown " reforms to help secure agreement with the @entity34 and " put @entity5 on the path to establishing a firm economic foundation and allow it to chart its own course			1
" @entity9 " agreed and said he plans to move quickly to do so , " @entity0 said			2
but @entity0 is not releasing all of the $ 1 billion the @entity56 adminstration pledged to @entity5 in may 2011 , after the democratic revolution that toppled longtime strongman @entity58			1
in addition to sunday 's $ 190 million , there is an additional $ 260 million in budget support funds still pending			1
and in a separate tranche of money , there is a further $ 550 million for scholarships and loan guarantees			0
release of these funds will depend on @entity9 's following through on political as well as economic steps			0
" the brave @entity5 who stood vigil in @entity72 did not risk their lives to see that opportunity for a brighter future squandered , " @entity0 said			0
" the @entity5 people must come together to address their economic challenge			0
" @entity5 's heavily tourism - dependent economy went into a tailspin when the revolution began			2
the @entity34 has offered $ 4.8 billion in loans to help revive the country 's economy , under conditions that @entity5 overhaul its finances , cut energy subsidies , raise taxes and reduce its budget deficit			1
@entity0 said @entity89 -- long @entity5 's leading ally -- still has concerns about free and fair elections , human rights , police conduct , clampdowns on nongovernmental organizations and other problems that beset @entity5 's troubled transition to democracy			1
" it is clear that more hard work and compromise will be required to restore unity , political stability and economic health to @entity5 , " @entity0 said			0
" the upcoming parliamentary elections are a particularly critical step in @entity5 's democratic transition			2
" @entity5 finance minister @entity108 said sunday that he expects an agreement between @entity5 and the @entity34 to be clinched before parliamentary elections on april 22			0
but some prominent members of @entity5 's opposition have doubts about accepting @entity34 aid because of the strings attached to it			1
the april 6 youth movement said the loan " puts the people in severe austerity measures			0
" @entity122 syndicates , independent think - tanks and @entity125 leader @entity124 have opposed @entity34 assistance			0
the conservative @entity130 @entity129 bloc opposes the loans because they require @entity5 to pay interest , a violation of their interpretation of @entity130 , bloc spokesman @entity127 said			0
former foreign minister and @entity138 chief @entity136 said in february that he supports the @entity34 package , but is " against relying heavily on the loan only			0
" @entity136 called for an international conference to help lift the economy			0
but many businessmen want the country to go ahead with the loan as soon as possible			0
and @entity108 said the government 's reform program includes sections about social justice , fighting corruption and tax reforms and that it would be implemented whether or not @entity5 comes to terms with the @entity34 .			1

@entity5 says it will impose reforms with or without @entity34 loan
@entity0 releases $ 190 million to @entity5 's government , $ 60 million for business
more money will come if @entity5 implements reforms , @entity0 says
