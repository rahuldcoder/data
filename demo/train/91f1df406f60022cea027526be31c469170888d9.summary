the investigation of the attack that killed ambassador @entity21 and three other @entity6 continues , these people said , as investigators try to build their case against @entity13 and others who authorities believe were involved			1
if @entity28 can interview @entity7 suspect , why ca n't @entity27 ? @entity31 spokesman @entity30 declined to comment as did @entity27 spokesman @entity32 in @entity16			1
