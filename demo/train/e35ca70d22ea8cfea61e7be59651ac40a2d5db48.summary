@entity1 doctors , priests , journalists and accountants will be allowed to arm themselves while at work under a controversial new gun law that takes effect in their country this month			1
under the @entity1 ' @entity16 , people working in these sectors -- along with nurses , engineers , bank tellers , and lawyers -- are considered " in imminent danger due to their profession " and will be allowed to carry small guns when outside their homes			1
to qualify for a special firearms permit , people in these professions have to pass drug and psychiatric tests , and show they do n't have any criminal convictions or pending cases for crimes with punishments of more than two years in prison			1
this relaxes the requirements of the previous gun law , the @entity16 8294 , under which they had to prove they were under " actual threat " of danger to carry a firearm			1
the regulations could be good news for reporters in the @entity1 , who live in one of the world 's deadliest countries for the media , according to the @entity44			2
some 74 journalists , mostly covering politics , have been murdered in the @entity1 since 1992 , the press freedom group says			1
in more than 70 % of cases , the killers have gone unpunished			0
with gun ownership high -- there were 1.2 million registered firearms in the @entity1 in 2012 , according to data from the @entity54 , and estimates for unregistered weapons are in the hundreds of thousands -- firearms are often blamed for violence in the country			1
during @entity63 celebrations alone , at least 30 people were injured and one infant killed by stray bullets , the police said			0
@entity1 ' authorities say the new law will help them better regulate the use of firearms and curb gun - related crimes , according to local media reports			1
the law sets harsher penalties for individuals found guilty of possessing unlicensed guns , who now face at least 30 years in jail			2
the @entity16 10591 also requires gun owners to have three separate permits : a license to own a firearm , registration for the gun , and a third permit to carry the weapon outside his or her residence			0
but not everyone who is eligible for the special permits will be rushing out to buy guns			0
catholic priests criticized the law after it was signed by president @entity94 in may last year , saying that it was contrary to their belief that society needs peace , not violence			2
" priests are supposed to be men of peace , not of war , " the @entity102 reported bishop @entity103 from @entity105 province as saying			0
" @entity107 said : ' he who lives by the sword will die by the sword			0
we should not counter violence with violence			0
" watch : video shows test firing of @entity116 - printed handgun			0

a new law in the @entity1 allows professionals " in imminent danger " of attack to carry guns
doctors , priests , accountants , journalists , and bank tellers are among those who qualify
@entity1 authorities say the law will help them to improve the regulation of firearms
