-- november 1 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : welcome to november ! and to a new week of @entity0			2
first up today , a story that spans multiple continents			1
first up : security concerns @entity22 president @entity21 : we will continue to pursue additional protective measures for as long as it takes to ensure the safety and security of our citizens			1
i have also directed that we spare no effort in investigating the origins of these suspicious packages and their connection to any additional terrorist plotting			2
@entity35 : the president 's talking about a suspected terrorist plan that spread from the @entity38 to @entity39 and almost to the @entity22 @entity40 got a tip and stopped it this past friday			1
the president mentioned suspicious packages			2
there were two of those			2
one was found on a plane in the @entity50			2
the other , on a plane in @entity53			2
each of the packages had an explosive device hidden inside a computer printer			2
officials say those explosives were designed to be set off remotely ; they could be triggered with a cell phone			1
@entity61 warned the @entity22 about the packages			1
and then @entity22 and @entity50 officials told the @entity38 nation of @entity4			1
authorities think these bombs came from an @entity68 terrorist group inside @entity4			2
the packages were found on cargo planes , but officials think the bombs might also have flown on passenger planes			1
both of them were inside packages that were headed to @entity77 , @entity78 ; never made it there			0
@entity81 looks at why someone might have wanted to send these explosives on a cargo plane			1
( begin video ) @entity86 , @entity0 correspondent : it was an intelligence tip , not a random check , that led to the discovery of the suspicious package at the airport in @entity50			0
that 's according to @entity50 police sources			1
one of the world 's top air security experts says the contents , a manipulated toner cartridge , and the origin of the package had to have set off alarms			1
some things about this particular shipment just did n't seem right to you ? @entity104 , ceo , new age security solutions : yes			0
it does n't make a lot of sense			0
@entity4 is not known to be an exporting country for the printers ' ink , certainly not to the @entity22			1
so , i think there is already something in the nature of the shipment that i would say supposed to draw our attention			0
@entity119 : @entity120 , former top @entity121 air security chief who now advises the @entity123 and @entity124 airports , says packages in cargo planes are not screened as tightly as those in passenger aircraft			1
not every package on a cargo plane is x-rayed			0
@entity120 says that 's because terrorists typically do n't want to bring down cargo planes			1
but if the intended targets are elsewhere , those procedures could change , at least temporarily			0
@entity138 officials say , because of this incident , we 'll see heightened screening of cargo at most major airports , more explosive trace detection , more use of imaging technology			0
@entity120 says areas like this in the @entity22 and elsewhere also need more security -- the perimeters around the cargo loading areas and where the planes are -- because even though they have security , they are much more out in the open			1
but a crucial screening system is in place			0
it 's called the @entity156			1
officials at the @entity158 and @entity159 tell us it 's basically an intelligence - sharing network for cargo			1
government security agencies around the world work with private companies , businesses and the transporters like @entity159 to track everything about a given package			0
( @entity171 ) @entity172 @entity35 : police investigators are trying to find out who 's responsible for a bomb that did go off in a @entity38 country this weekend			1
it happened in @entity178 , largest city in @entity5 , a nation a little bit bigger than the @entity22 state of @entity182			1
at least 32 people were wounded in the attack , some of them seriously			0
but according to police , the suspected suicide bomber was the only person killed			0
@entity187 @entity188 , @entity15 : today 's first @entity189 goes out to mr. @entity191 's 6th grade humanities block at @entity192 in @entity193 , @entity194 ! how many @entity196 seats are up for election this tuesday ? is it : a ) 33 , b ) 37 , c ) 100 or @entity199 ) 435 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! this year 's midterm elections will determine 37 @entity196 seats			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! midterm elections @entity35 : you 've been hearing about it for awhile ; now , this week , you are going to hear results			1
the midterm election is tomorrow ! voters will be heading out to polls all across the country , casting their ballots for national , state and local candidates			1
there 's a lot at stake in these elections			1
right now , @entity221 have a majority in both the @entity196 and the @entity223			0
republicans are expected to make some gains on tuesday			0
the big question is whether they 'll win enough seats to take over the majority in either of those chambers of @entity231			0
meanwhile , the candidates are still out there trying to rally up support			0
@entity235 , ( r ) senate candidate , @entity194 : i think the country needs to go in a very different direction			0
and this is really just a lot bigger than just me and one race			0
this is really about the future of this country			0
sen. @entity246 , ( @entity199 ) @entity194 : the most important thing in this election is that people have a voice and that the powerful interests that can buy ads and not tell us who they are because of the @entity256 decision should be a concern to all of us			0
shoutout @entity259 @entity260 , @entity15 : time for a @entity261 ! we asked about the @entity196 , now we want to know how many seats in the @entity22 @entity223 are up for election on tuesday ? is it : a ) 37 , b ) 100 , c ) 217 or @entity199 ) 435 ? another three seconds -- go ! the midterms will determine all 435 seats in the @entity223			1
that 's your answer and that 's your @entity261 ! web promo @entity35 : @entity223 , @entity196 and governors ' race results : @entity0 will have election outcomes later on in the week			1
meantime , the @entity277 has all your midterm info			1
you 'll find a link to that in the @entity283 section of your favorite web site : @entity285 ! @entity286 @entity35 : football , baseball , basketball : a lot of sports fans go all out when they cheer for their teams , especially when they 're at the stadium			1
in @entity7 , there 's one soccer stadium that 's looking at ways to turn all that fan energy into ... energy			1
@entity299 shows us how some fans can root for their team and the environment at the same time			1
( begin video ) @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 : in the game of football , there are few certainties , except for this : fans on their feet , pounding , jumping , never stopping for two hours ; energy for the players on the field			1
but @entity318 , who works for the @entity320 team , saw something else			0
@entity328 , @entity329 [ @entity330 ] : " there 's got to be some way to harness their energy in some sort of eco-friendly way , " she thought			1
@entity331 : it turns out , there is			0
in @entity7 , the @entity335 train began capturing the energy commuters made while walking through the turnstiles			1
and at @entity340 's main @entity307 headquarters , the company is developing its own floor panels which capture the energy of human foot traffic			1
so , @entity318 convinced the team to join in the emerging kinetic energy panel field			1
@entity320 bought 24 panels , which landed under the feet of the fan section , where @entity349 is glad his girth is helping the environment			0
@entity353 , @entity354 [ @entity330 ] : " i 'm bigger than the other fans , " he says ... @entity331 : ... pointing out that he 's able to produce more energy with each heavy jump			1
the power cord , says @entity318 , carries the fans ' energy to a power box , to batteries			1
the amount of real energy produced in this testing phase is actually quite small			2
because the last game was a tie , these three aa batteries were charged			0
but the stadium is using the energy produced for a real purpose : to power flashlights for the night games			1
just the beginning , pledges @entity375			0
do you envision a day when this entire stadium will have this type of energy flooring ? @entity328 [ @entity330 ] : i think so			2
i hope one day this system will be in every seat , producing more clean energy			2
@entity331 : the team hopes football stadiums around the world will see @entity6 's small experiment and want to jump in			2
the biggest stumbling blocks right now , practicality and price tag			0
( @entity171 ) @entity391 @entity35 : your questions			0
our very first @entity391 conversation of the school year is tonight			0
the time is 6:30 p.m. @entity38			0
the address : @entity401 / cnnstudentnews			0
i am looking forward to typing with you ! before we go @entity35 : ... though there wo n't be a photo booth like you saw in that video			0
it 'll just be us , text and our computers			0
a student recently asked me why so many of our before we go segments involve cats			0
i said it 's ' cause cats are crazy			2
this one 's just cute ! it 's an 8 - week - old lion cub , a new addition to the @entity418			2
the swimming lesson 's for his own good			2
before he 's allowed in the habitat for lions , he 's got ta prove he can keep his little head above water , in case he falls in the moat and no one 's around to fish him out			2
goodbye @entity35 : needless to say , he passed the test swimmingly , though he had to work to stay afloat ; he could n't just be lion around			2
and we 're sure when he makes his debut at the zoo , he will be lionized			0
all right , i know some of you are waiting to roar at me about those puns			0
you can on @entity391 tonight			0
i am looking forward to talking to you			0
i 'm @entity17 for @entity0 ! and we will see you either tonight on @entity391 or tomorrow , when our show returns .			0
