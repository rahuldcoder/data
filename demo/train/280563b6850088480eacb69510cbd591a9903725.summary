-- in case you think your weekends are filling up now that spring is here , consider the humdinger of a three - day stretch @entity7 coach @entity6 might face in @entity8 starting april 6			1
saturday : coach a team in the @entity11 for the seventh time , tying @entity14 coach @entity13 for the fourth most in @entity16 history			2
only @entity17 ( 12 ) , @entity18 ( 11 ) and @entity19 ( 11 ) have coached in more			0
sunday : receive official word from the @entity21 that he has been chose for induction , the highest honor in the sport			0
@entity6 is one of 12 finalists , with enshrinement in @entity28 , @entity29 , on september 8			1
monday : lead the @entity30 to their first national championship since 1986 -- and , in the process , become the first coach to win a title at two programs			2
he led the @entity37 to the 1996 title			0
this scenario is possible for @entity6 , whose top - seeded @entity30 play 12th - seeded @entity40 in the @entity41 on friday in @entity42			1
a win against the @entity44 , followed by a victory against either @entity46 or @entity47 , and @entity6 might have the most incredible @entity11 weekend for a coach in history			2
not that he is willing to consider this possibility now			0
@entity6 did n't become one of the most successful coaches of his generation -- with 660 victories at the college level and another 192 in the @entity56 -- by looking ahead			1
" not for two seconds , " he said with a smile thursday when asked about the potential for that weekend in @entity8			0
" until you brought it up , i did n't even know it was being voted on			0
" the hall selection is voted on by a committee			0
the basketball , of course , is played for the world to see			0
with the way his team has played over the past seven weeks , the @entity30 have emerged as the clear favorite in what was the most wide - open college basketball season in years			1
@entity72 : @entity6 : @entity73 since a 104 - 101 loss at @entity75 on february 9 -- an epic five - overtime thriller that ranks among the best games of the season -- @entity7 has won 12 straight games			1
only one of those , a 58 - 53 win over a @entity82 team then ranked 12th in the nation , was decided by single digits			2
@entity6 would never classify this @entity7 team as his best , not when he regularly filled @entity56 rosters while coaching the other half of this bluegrass blood rivalry at @entity91			1
but few teams have bought into his philosophy better than this one , with a relentless pressing defense and unselfish offense built around the 3 - point line			0
let the most recent victim explain : " i do n't want to put any pressure on @entity6 and his guys , but they 're special , " @entity98 said after his @entity104 team suffered an 82 - 56 loss in the third round			2
" they need a little luck like everybody does to win it all ... but i ca n't say enough about coach @entity6 and how he gets his guys to play for 40 minutes as impressive as i 've ever seen			1
" it is almost hard to believe that the still - young - looking @entity6 is 60 , that he is in his fourth decade as a coach			1
but it 's been 34 years since he took his first head coaching job at @entity117 , 26 years since he took his first team to the @entity11 with @entity119 and 17 years since he clipped the nets for the first ( and so far only ) time as a champion at @entity91			2
@entity7 is his seventh stop as a head coach , and at 12 seasons so far , his longest			1
@entity6 has taken the @entity30 to a pair of @entity126 , in 2005 and 2012 , but has never led them to a title			1
this is not only his best shot , but a team that he has enjoyed coaching like few in his career			0
@entity72 : @entity16 brackets 2013 : updated look at @entity133 " if i can keep recruiting guys like this , i want to coach until 70 and beyond , because i 've had such a blast and to see guys work that hard inside just fills you up , really does , " @entity6 said			1
" that 's not easy to do what they do			0
i do n't think in my best day as an athlete i could have done half of what these guys do in the course of a game			0
it 's really amazing what they do on the court			0
" it starts with @entity6			2
of the remaining coaches in the @entity154 , he is one of six with titles on his resume , with two -- @entity46 's @entity18 and @entity82 's @entity157 -- already @entity158			0
but few have left a bigger imprint on the game than the @entity7 coach			1
@entity6 helped usher in a new era in college basketball , recognizing before most coaches that the 3 - point line would radically change how the game would be played			1
his teams defended all 94 feet on the court , using their quickness to force turnovers and emphasizing that any open shot from behind that arc is a good one			0
he said it was a style he developed at @entity117 , a struggling program he rebuilt , when he was a 20 - something coach			2
" so i could basically make all the mistakes i wanted to and no one noticed , " he said			0
" i was continuing tinkering with the full court press , changing it , working at it			0
for the five years at @entity117 , i came up with a style of play that i stuck with from that point on			0
" or , as his point guard @entity184 said , " we can play at the @entity186 , and i guarantee you coach @entity6 will still have us pressing full court			1
" @entity72 : @entity190 to winning 2013 @entity154 the style -- and , of course , the players -- helped made him a winner at each of his college stops , and he even used it with mixed results in the @entity56			1
when the @entity30 fell behind by 16 early in the second half to @entity82 in this @entity203 championship game this season , it was the press that helped turn the game around -- and , eventually , into a 17 - point victory			1
the @entity30 are deep , talented and balanced , led by an experienced back court in @entity184 ( 9.7 points and 5.9 assists a game ) and @entity211 ( 18.4 points )			2
" from a talent standpoint ( this team ) may not even be in my top five , " @entity6 said			2
" but in terms of execution , intensity , a will to win , it 's up there			0
we do n't play the game for the lottery ( in the @entity56 ) draft			1
we play the game for @entity7 , and then our guys move on and they 're very successful people in and out of basketball			1
" i 'm just having a blast			0
the kids are just loving , loving individuals and just great to be around			0
" @entity6 has this team two victories away from another @entity11 -- and , quite possibly , a weekend like no coach in history has ever experienced .			1

@entity7 basketball coach @entity6 has 660 college - level victories and 192 with the @entity56
@entity6 's top - seeded @entity30 play 12th - seeded @entity40 friday in the @entity41
@entity6 , 60 , on his 34 - year career : " i want to coach until 70 and beyond "
@entity7 is on a 12 - game winning streak
