-- @entity3 number one 's @entity1 and @entity4 continued their successful title defenses in @entity7 thursday but the @entity9 capital again proved a less than happy hunting ground for @entity12 champion @entity11			1
his 2014 travails continued with a 6 - 3 6 - 2 defeat to in - form @entity17 @entity16 in the third round , extending his poor record at the @entity20 since the tournament switched from hard courts to clay in 2009			2
@entity11 scored an impressive victory over @entity9 's @entity25 the previous evening , but he never looked set to stage a repeat against @entity16			1
the @entity28 @entity27 has slipped to eighth in the rankings after undergoing back surgery in the autumn of 2013 and his match against @entity25 was his first in a month			1
@entity11 is also without a coach following the end of his relationship with @entity36 , but even at his best might have struggled to cope with @entity16 , who reached the final in @entity38 two weeks ago			1
" it 's tough because some days just now i 'm playing well and then the next day i 'm not playing well at all , " @entity11 told gathered reporters after his defeat			1
" even within matches i 'm playing really well for periods and then other times not great at all			0
" i need to become more consistent , " he added			0
after losing the opener , @entity11 had a break point on his opponent 's service in the second set but squandered the opportunity before sliding to defeat			1
in seven tournaments this year , @entity11 has failed to reach a final and admitted he was struggling to find answers			1
" i 'm not 100 percent sure what it is , but i need to sit down and think about that over the next couple of days and see what i need to do			0
" @entity16 will play @entity9 's @entity60 in the last eight			2
earlier , @entity1 , looking to get back to his invincible best after defeats @entity64 and @entity25 in the quarterfinals in @entity66 and @entity38 , dispatched @entity67 6 - 1 6 - 4			1
@entity1 saw his 3 - 1 lead in the second set disappear , but he reasserted his control to go through in some style			1
" during the first hour i played better than yesterday , more dynamically and with more intensity , " @entity1 told the official @entity72 website			1
" i was defending properly and knowing what was happening in every single moment			2
perhaps that 's something i was n't able to do in recent weeks , " he added			2
@entity1 will next face sixth seed @entity77 , who had to battle past @entity80 @entity79 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 in one hour and 50 minutes			1
it was his first win in three meetings with @entity79 , the turning point in the second set when he broke him for the first of three times			0
" @entity79 started really well			0
he was serving exceptionally well , playing aggressively and i could n't find a way to get into his service games , " said @entity77			0
" but , finally , i took my first break point in the second set and from that point things changed quite dramatically			0
i was happy with the way i handled the match and how i played			0
" @entity38 winner , 10th seed @entity92 also advanced to the last eight with a 7 - 6 7 - 6 win over @entity96 of @entity97			0
the @entity99 star came from 2 - 5 down in the first set to win the opening tiebreak and set him on his way to a crucial victory			0
" i 'm playing well and feeling very confident , " said the 24 - year - old			0
in the @entity106 event at the same venue , top - ranked @entity4 overcame problems on her own service in beating @entity9 's @entity110 6 - 2 6 - 3 in search of a third straight title in @entity7			1
@entity4 was broken twice in her opening three service games , but @entity110 was unable to hold on her own delivery			2
it was the same in the second set , with @entity4 broken twice more but she held on to set up a meeting with @entity117 in the last eight			2
@entity117 beat fellow @entity120 @entity119 6 - 4 6 - 3 , while second seed @entity124 had a more testing morning as she came from a set down to beat 16th seed @entity121 of the @entity123 2 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2			0
@entity126 champion @entity124 will now face @entity127 for a place in the semifinals after the @entity130 continued her superb recent form on clay with a 6 - 4 6 - 3 win over @entity135 @entity134			0
former @entity136 champion @entity127 is coming off a title success in @entity138 and used her serve effectively to see off @entity134 .			2
