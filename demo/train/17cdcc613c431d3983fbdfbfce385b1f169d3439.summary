-- a controversial law requiring adults applying for welfare assistance to undergo drug screening has gone into effect in @entity6			1
saying it is " unfair for @entity6 taxpayers to subsidize drug addiction , " gov. @entity7 signed the legislation in june			1
" it 's the right thing for taxpayers , " @entity7 said after signing the measure			1
" it 's the right thing for citizens of this state that need public assistance			0
we do n't want to waste tax dollars			1
and also , we want to give people an incentive to not use drugs			2
" under the law , which went into effect on friday , the @entity6 @entity24 will be required to conduct the drug tests on adults applying to the federal @entity30 program			2
the aid recipients would be responsible for the cost of the screening , which they would recoup in their assistance if they qualify			0
those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to receive the benefits on behalf of their children			1
shortly after the bill was signed , five democrats from the state 's congressional delegation issued a joint statement attacking the legislation , one calling it " downright unconstitutional			0
" and the @entity46 has filed suit against the state for requiring all state workers to take a drug test and is considering suing the state for drug - testing welfare applicants			2
controversy over the measure was heightened by @entity7 's past association with a company he co-founded that operates walk - in urgent care clinics in @entity6 and counts drug screening among the services it provides			1
in april , @entity7 , who had transferred his ownership interest in @entity63 to a trust in his wife 's name , said the company would not contract for state business , according to local media reports			1
he subsequently sold his majority stake in the company , local media reported			0
on may 18 , the @entity71 ruled that two conflict - of - interest complaints against @entity7 were legally insufficient to warrant investigation , and adopted an opinion that no " prohibited conflict of interest " existed			2
@entity6 is not the first state to pass such legislation			0
@entity79 passed a similar law that the 6th @entity81 found unconstitutional in 2003 since it violated the @entity83 @entity82 , which protects citizens against unreasonable search			0
the court said the law would set a dangerous precedent by allowing the government to conduct drug searches for the safety of the public without prior suspicion			0
@entity0 's @entity93 contributed to this report .			0

gov. @entity7 says the measure saves tax dollars and provides " incentive to not use drugs "
