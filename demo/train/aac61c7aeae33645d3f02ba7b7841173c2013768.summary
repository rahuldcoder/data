-- tuesday , attorney general @entity1 delivers a major speech on voting rights at the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6			1
the location is significant : in 1965 , president @entity8 signed the @entity9 into law , a landmark piece of civil rights legislation that banned the worst forms of racial discrimination in @entity16 elections			1
over the past five decades , the @entity9 and other federal and state election reforms have greatly expanded access to the ballot box			1
as a testament to their success , the 2008 presidential electorate was the largest and most demographically diverse in the history of the @entity16			2
but the protections the @entity9 affords have not lost their relevance , or their indispensability			2
in the past year , lawmakers in 40 states have introduced legislation that would make it harder for all eligible @entity32 to vote -- and harder disproportionately for people of color , @entity32 , and our seniors			1
some @entity39 states , like @entity40 , @entity41 , and @entity6 , have not only passed legislation restricting the right to vote , but also have refused to comply with their responsibilities under the @entity9			1
the law requires certain states with histories of voting discrimination to submit any change in election law to the @entity16 @entity50 for " preclearance " before it can be implemented			1
because these states for so long flaunted an obstinate refusal to allow @entity55 equal access to the voting booth , the @entity9 requires they demonstrate that new changes will not have a discriminatory effect			1
@entity41 and @entity6 both passed requirements that voters present restrictive forms of government - issued photo id at polling places , even though 25 % of african - americans and 19 % of @entity66 lack the necessary form of @entity62			0
after passing their laws , both of these states filed preclearance letters with @entity50 , but neither could explain how the new law avoided repeating an abhorrent history of discrimination			1
@entity40 severely restricted voter registration drives , although minority voters register through drives at twice the rate of white voters			0
the @entity40 also cut early voting , the process through which more than half of the state 's african - americans cast ballots in 2008			0
@entity40 implemented its restrictive bill in violation of the @entity9 and only submitted the legislation for preclearance after it was sued in federal court			2
when @entity50 questioned the discriminatory impact of these changes , @entity40 removed the most controversial parts of its law from the department 's consideration and instead asked a federal court to excuse it from its obligations under the @entity9			1
these states are seemingly unable and have clearly failed to craft election laws that will affect all equally			0
and , apparently , they do n't even want to			0
rather than work toward solutions that allow more eligible @entity32 to vote , some states have filed lawsuits arguing that parts of the @entity9 -- one of our nation 's most successful pieces of civil rights legislation -- are unconstitutional			1
ensuring that all citizens can exercise their right to vote extends beyond just those states with significant histories of race discrimination			2
in 2011 , many other states have embarked on voter suppression efforts			0
in a new report , " @entity131 , " the @entity121 and @entity122 examine the past year 's assault on voting , demonstrating that the " onslaught of restrictive measures " was " designed to stem electoral strength among communities of color			2
" this is only the latest in a series of reports highlighting the wrongheadedness of this movement against voting rights			1
earlier this month , the @entity139 's @entity138 released a major report which said @entity141 have undertaken this effort purely for partisan gain			0
earlier this year , the @entity144 also released substantial reports			0
testifying before @entity146 in november , @entity1 said that legislation aimed at voter suppression is " inconsistent with what we say we are as a nation			0
" i could n't agree more			0
@entity8 signed the @entity9 to ensure that the right to vote extended to all @entity32 , regardless of their race			2
the @entity9 was more than just another federal law ; it was -- and remains -- the embodiment of years of struggle , resulting from countless sacrifices of brave men and women who built the civil rights movement			2
we must not allow a new generation of restrictions to condition the right to vote on arbitrary qualifications and discriminatory rules			0
i welcome @entity1 's voice to the chorus of millions of @entity32 who have defended the sanctity of the vote			0
and i hope that @entity50 will continue to move our nation forward and protect every eligible citizen 's fundamental right to vote			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

the reforms of the @entity9 are under threat , says @entity179
@entity179 : lawmakers in 40 states have introduced legislation that would make it harder to vote
voting would be harder especially for people of color , the young and seniors , she says
the @entity50 must continue to *safeguard* @entity16 voting rights , @entity179 says
