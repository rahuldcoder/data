@entity11 's saga began in may , when allegations emerged that he appeared to be smoking crack cocaine on a pipe on cell phone video taken months earlier , in the winter of 2012			1
after initially denying that he smoked the drug , he admitted in november that he did			2
on the show , when asked about how he handles all the media attention he 's received in the past few months , @entity1 said he is staying focused on serving his constituents			2
" all the other stuff is nonsense , " he said			0
@entity11 got testy with the hosts when they asked him about the tape , telling them that they could talk to his lawyers if they wanted to keep asking him questions about controversy			1
" i 'm here to talk about football , " he said			0
@entity1 described what a huge pigskin fan he is			0
he said that his home is full of football jerseys and regalia , and that he used to play center			0
he also said he has a football pool in his mayoral office			2
documents : criminal suspects claimed @entity11 tried to buy damaging video the hosts asked him if he is a fan of online poker , and he enthusiastically said he is , and then told the hosts that if they came to @entity2 , he would treat them like " kings , " and maybe they 'd go out for chicken wings			1
the hosts asked him what the future holds for him			2
the " future is i 'm getting re-elected , " @entity1 replied			2
the hosts asked if @entity11 has the support of the people			1
" absolutely , " he answered			0

there 's a ton of names out there			2
" then he added : " the more the merrier			0
let my record speak for itself			0
" mayor @entity1 : a man of contrasts allegations about damaging tape the sports radio interview aired a day after the release of documents that say @entity1 tried to buy a damaging tape from criminal suspects -- months before a tape was publicized showing him smoking crack			1
that 's according to documents @entity0 obtained from @entity77 crown counsel @entity76 that are tied to a @entity79 investigation into organized crime called @entity81			2
@entity11 was n't the focus of this investigation , and he has not been charged with a crime			1
but , after allegedly interacting with several players who were involved in the probe , he ended up getting ensnared in it			0
@entity11 vows ' outright war ' after council strips his powers the mayor 's camp did not return a @entity0 request for comment			1
according to the documents , police translating a march 27 phone conversation , primarily from the @entity97 language , believed that the men were talking about " receiving an offer from @entity1 in exchange for a video			0
" the men discussed an apparent offer of $ 5,000 and a car in exchange for the video , as well as selling the tape to the @entity109 newspaper and an unnamed website			0
the court documents state : " at the end of the discussion , ( one of the men ) said he does not want to go to the media but would just see him ( believed to be referring to @entity11 ) , ... he says he 'll ask for 100 or 150 " -- possibly referring to $ 100,000 or $ 150,000			1
these conversations do n't delve into specifics about what 's on the video			1
but earlier this year , allegations surfaced in two media outlets that @entity11 had been recorded last winter using crack cocaine			1
in may , the @entity126 and the website @entity125 published stories saying their reporters saw 90 seconds of a cell phone video showing @entity11 , as the @entity126 described it , " inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe			1
" later in the video -- as described by @entity126 -- an " incoherent " man both the @entity126 and @entity125 claimed was @entity11 ranted about a number of subjects			1
after that report came out , @entity1 said he had no reason to resign			0
yet pressure on him increased earlier this fall when @entity2 's police chief announced investigators had recovered a video that purportedly showed @entity1 smoking from a crack pipe			1
the next week , on november 5 , @entity1 admitted that he 'd " smoked crack cocaine ... probably in one of my drunken stupors , probably approximately about a year ago			1
" he denied being an addict			0
even after this admission , @entity11 refused to resign			1
instead , he vowed " outright war " on the city council when , later in the month , it slashed the mayor 's budget and transferred most of his duties to the deputy mayor			1
" if you think @entity164 - style politics is nasty , you guys have just attacked @entity165 , " @entity1 said then to groans and laughter in the city council chambers			0
the mayor 's voice is less apparent in the documents released wednesday , although he is not necessarily insignificant			1
authorities say that phone intercepts from early on april 20 , for instance , indicate one woman telling a man " that @entity1 is at the residence			0
" two minutes later , at 12:54 a.m. , another man allegedly tells the first " to go to @entity178 's ... house to deliver drugs to @entity1 , " the court documents say			2
@entity11 on controversial team names whenever the @entity9 , radio hosts asked @entity1 about his political life thursday , he tried to steer the conversation back to sports			1
" mayor , what is your link to the @entity189 -- ' cause your people have told us that you actually were a @entity192 fan or you went to @entity192 camp ? " @entity1 said he went to a youth football camp in @entity195 for three years that was staffed , at least in part , by @entity189 players			0
" these guys literally taught us how to play football -- banging on your door at 7 a.m. it was great discipline at a young age , so i went back there three years in a row			0
" one of the hosts asked him what he thought about opposition to the name @entity189 , which some think is offensive to @entity212			0
" why do n't we look at the @entity213 , " @entity1 replied			0
" what are we gon na call them next , the @entity216 ? like , where do we go with this ? it 's been around for years and years and years and if they were offended they should have come out when the name was first initiated			0
you started playing -- how long have the @entity192 had their name for ? how long have the @entity225 had their name for ? how long have the @entity213 had their name for ? years and years and years and all of a sudden the politically correct people have to come out now ? i think everything 's fine and i would just stick with the name			0
