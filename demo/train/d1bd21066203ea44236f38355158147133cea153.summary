-- a celebration of specialness , @entity2 's slick blockbuster " @entity3 " presents what may be the ultimate team : half a dozen @entity9 superheroes for the price of one			1
you do n't need me to tell you it 's the culmination of a five - year plan that began with @entity17 's @entity16 taking @entity18 aside at the end of the first " @entity18 " to tip him off as to the " @entity20			1
" there is a bigger picture , he told him -- and here it is : the be-all but not ( they 're hoping ) the end - all of the current craze for @entity30 - enhanced superheroics			2
interspersing flip one - liners with a host of larger - than - life characters and the usual flurry of fight - and - flight scenes , the film is never less than amusing			1
still , it 's never more than amusing either			0
@entity39 has made it a point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the @entity47 / @entity46 @entity45 films			0
the lightness is fun but it does n't offer much of a foundation on which to build an epic			0
and let 's face it , there 's more than a whiff of opportunism about a project that pits a defrosted @entity72 hero , @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , an inventor - industrialist , @entity18 ( @entity76 ) , the pagan lightning god , @entity77 ( @entity71 ) , a scientist with anger - management issues , @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , and shield agents @entity58 ( @entity59 ) and @entity60 ( @entity61 ) against the @entity63 god of mischief , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and a legion of marauding aliens			1
in @entity79 still , @entity80 ( who shares a screenplay credit with @entity83 ) is a very sharp operator			0
he knows which buttons to press and where there 's room for a little diversion			0
the improbability of this misfit coalition becomes the movie 's most rewarding asset			2
imagine the bristling egos of so many power players cooped up in the same room ! the movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand - offs			2
not surprisingly , @entity76 's flip , cynical @entity18 ( @entity18 ) gets a good measure of the movie 's best lines , bouncing off @entity73 ' ( @entity73 ) boy scout idealism and @entity77 's guileless sledgehammer style ( sometimes literally )			1
@entity2 also crafts a couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for @entity59 's @entity58 , a far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in " @entity112			0
" but no question , the movie 's not - so - secret weapon is @entity55			1
share your review of " @entity3 " @entity56 is the third actor to play @entity55 / @entity55 in the past decade , and even though the soft - spoken star would seem to have the longest fuse ( when we first see him he 's tending to the sick in an @entity123 slum ) he 's immediately both more dangerous and more fun than either @entity125 or @entity126 in the same role			1
@entity80 gives him a long build up			0
for the first hour of the movie we 're invited to speculate along with his new allies just how much havoc @entity55 's rampaging id might cause			0
then the leash comes off ! never underestimate the entertainment value of the @entity136			0
that 's probably the most important lesson to be drawn here , and one that clearly has n't been lost on the filmmakers , who have reportedly signed @entity56 to a six - picture deal			2
beyond that , the movie wants us to believe that these action figures have learned to play nice and work as a team -- which is good news for humanity , but maybe not so promising for the inevitable sequels			2
a climax on the war - torn streets of @entity153 could almost be an extended outtake from the last " transformers " flick -- @entity2 can only push the blockbuster form so far -- but if it 's a friday night @entity160 you 're after , " @entity3 " gets the job done .			1

" @entity3 " -- interspersing flip one - liners with a host of larger - than - life characters
@entity76 's @entity18 gets a good measure of the movie 's best lines
@entity56 is more dangerous and more fun than either @entity125 or @entity126
