@entity0 -- the @entity2 passed a joint resolution tuesday supporting the limited use of @entity6 military force in @entity7 for one year -- a move sought by the @entity10 administration as it works to win clear congressional backing of the controversial @entity13 mission			1
the resolution , which explicitly rejects any introduction of @entity6 ground troops , was approved 14 - 5			2
it now advances to the full @entity18 - controlled @entity2			0
the @entity20 - controlled @entity19 rejected a similar measure last friday , but also voted down a bill restricting @entity6 involvement in the conflict			1
deep congressional divisions over the mission stem from , among other things , a belief among some representatives and senators on both sides of the aisle that the @entity33 has violated the @entity34			1
passed in 1973 , the law gives a president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending @entity6 forces to war , followed by a 30 - day extension to end hostilities			1
the combined 90 - day period ended last week without any congressional expression of support for @entity6 's role in the @entity47 - led operation			2
administration officials have repeatedly asserted that the @entity6 role in @entity7 does not meet the law 's definition of hostilities			1
the president reportedly overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the @entity55 and the @entity57 's @entity56 in declining to seek congressional authorization			2
earlier tuesday , top @entity60 legal adviser @entity59 told members of the committee that the @entity64 law does not apply to the @entity6 military intervention			1
@entity59 argued that the measure is not applicable because the @entity6 role in the mission is limited in terms of its scope , means , exposure of @entity6 forces , and chances of escalation			1
" the precedent here has been narrowly drawn , " @entity59 asserted			0
republicans on the committee did not agree			0
@entity79 sen. @entity78 , the committee 's top @entity20 , said president @entity10 's decision to intervene without explicit congressional backing was a " fundamental failure of leadership that placed expedience " before constitutional responsibility			1
" there was no good reason why president @entity10 should have failed to seek authorization " by @entity91 , he added			2
there has been a " lack of constitutional discipline " in this case			0
sen. @entity96 , @entity97 , told @entity59 he was " sticking a stick in the eyes of @entity91 , " " i think you 've undermined the integrity of the @entity34 , " @entity96 said			0
by refusing to take a tougher stance against the administration 's actions , senators are " making ourselves irrelevant " to debates over military action , he added			1
@entity59 told committee members that a " major structural flaw " of the law is that , absent explicit congressional approval , it requires an automatic termination of military engagements after 60 days			1
" you can not run these things by autopilot , " he said			0
executive and legislative branch judgment is required in each instance , he asserted			0
@entity59 , along with both @entity18 and @entity20 , acknowledged the act could be updated to reflect technological advances such as unmanned predator drone strikes -- something unheard of when the law was passed during the @entity127			0
the " language needs further clarification , " said @entity128 , the chairman of the committee			0
but for @entity91 to now " pull the rug out from under ( @entity6 's @entity47 allies ) would have far - reaching consequences , " he warned			0
the allied military effort in @entity7 , which has formal @entity137 support , was launched to protect civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by longtime leader @entity141			2
@entity143 leaders have made clear that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without @entity141 's ouster			0
the @entity33 has promised not to use @entity6 ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has nevertheless been mounting over several weeks .			2

new : the @entity2 backs limited @entity6 military action in @entity7
@entity60 legal adviser says the @entity7 mission is limited in scope , exposure of forces
key @entity20 argue @entity10 has *improperly* *circumvented* the 1973 @entity34
it requires the president to get congressional approval within 60 days after *deploying* military
