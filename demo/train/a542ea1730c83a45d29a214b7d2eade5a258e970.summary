-- owners of @entity2 and other tablet devices tend to be news junkies who are wealthier and more highly educated than than the general population , according to a new report			1
the @entity8 took an in - depth look at how people use tablets to get news			1
when the study was conducted in july , @entity13 's @entity2 made up the vast majority of tablet computers in use in the @entity18 , although @entity8 researchers also looked at people who used similar devices , such as the @entity22 , the @entity23 and even the @entity24			1
the project noted several differences between tablet users and the general @entity18 population			2
first , tablet users tend to be more highly educated : fifty - one percent have a college degree , compared with 28 % of all @entity18			1
tablet users also tend to be richer : fifth - three percent have an annual household income greater than $ 75,000 , compared with 28 % of the total @entity18 population			1
( conversely , 15 % of tablet users have an annual household income of less than $ 30,000 , while over a third of @entity18 households earn that much or less each year			1
) most tablet users have jobs : sixty - two percent are employed full time , compared with 41 % of the total population			1
along other demographic lines , tablets mostly mirror the general population in terms of gender , race and political ideology			0
but age indicates some differences : nearly half ( 46 % ) of tablet users are age 30 - 49 , while just 35 % of @entity18 are in that age bracket			1
also , only 7 % of tablet owners are age 65 or older , while 17 % of @entity18 are seniors			2
this part of the population is growing fast as baby boomers age			0
tablet users do seem to be hungry for news			1
the project notes : " about half ( 53 % ) get news on their tablet every day , and they read long articles as well as get headlines			1
" many news organizations are building and promoting their own apps specifically designed for tablets			0
the project found that about two - thirds of tablet users have a news app installed on their tablets , but that 's not where they get most of their news , even on the tablet			1
" the browser , carried over from the desktop experience , is still the more popular means of consuming news , " said the report			0
" a plurality of tablet news users ( 40 % ) say they get their news mainly through a web browser			2
another 31 % use news apps and the browser equally , while fewer , 21 % , get their news primarily through apps			0
" of course , the tablet market is shifting fast			0
right now , many smaller , cheaper tablets ( mostly marketed as e-readers , even though they really are tablets ) are hitting the @entity18 market just in time for the holiday buying season			0
@entity94 , deputy director of the @entity8 in @entity95 , says the study did take users of the @entity24 and similar modified tablets into account			2
it found that respondents used those devices to do much more than read books			0
" i certainly think that as newer tablet devices like the @entity107 come into the marketplace at a lower cost , that it opens the possibility of bringing in different kinds of people to the tablet population , especially people who are younger or not in the upper income bracket , " she said			0
the project also plans to do followup research on how tablet devices are shaping how @entity18 get news			0
" i think whether it 's called a tablet or some other name over the next couple of years , what matters is the kind of difference these devices make to the user experience , " @entity121 said			0
" people are using tablets to do different things with news than they did before			2
" the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity136 .			0
