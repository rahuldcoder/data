-- @entity1 has swept through 30 states since mid-august			1
what sets the virus apart from many others in the same family is its vicious symptoms : instead of just causing a summer cold , it sends children to the hospital -- where they often end up in the intensive care unit , struggling to breathe			1

but then the 3 - year - old got sick very quickly			1
@entity13 was in the first wave of children hit with @entity1			1
the virus struck early in states such as @entity15 , where children headed back to school last month , but it then spread to states such as @entity31 and @entity32 , where school began after @entity34			2

that night , he wheezes as he sleeps			0

august 26 @entity13 's breathing gets worse			1
" you could see him trying to pull the air in , " @entity76 recalls			0
" his nostrils flared as he inhaled , and you could see the muscles in his neck and collarbone working extra hard			0
" @entity19 adds , " i remember as a kid my goldfish jumped out of the bowl			0
that 's how he looked to me -- like a goldfish gasping for breath			0

his oxygen saturation rate is 86 %			0
healthy children 's oxygen saturation is around 97 %			2
the doctors give @entity13 oxygen through his nose			1
every two hours he gets nebulizer treatments , which are commonly used to treat asthma , to try to unclog his airways			0
@entity13 hates the mask and is n't cooperative			1
@entity13 's saturation rate goes up to 88 % , but that 's not enough			1
he 's admitted to the hospital			2
august 27 in addition to the oxygen and breathing treatments , @entity13 gets an oral steroid to help shrink the swelling in his airways			1
even then , @entity13 is still wheezing			2
" it sounded like air going through a balloon -- where you pinch the balloon and hear the squeaking sounds , " his father says			0
doctors try a " shaker vest			0
" blasts of air shake the vest , which loosens up mucus caught in the lungs			0

september 16 @entity13 has an appointment with his pediatrician , dr. @entity146			2
she gives him a clean bill of health			0
@entity13 's journey with @entity150 is fairly typical , says dr. @entity151 , division director of infectious diseases at @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity155			1
many children , however , get sick even faster			0
@entity13 was ill for about two days before he had to be hospitalized , but many of @entity159 's patients have gone from healthy to severely ill in just a day , and they arrive at the hospital barely able to breathe			1
" these kids were really struggling			0
many ca n't even speak a sentence , " she says			0
