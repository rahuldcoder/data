-- it was a penalty shootout that summed up @entity3 's season -- errant , careless and ultimately forlorn			1
this was the team that have dominated @entity8 football for years , one of the biggest on the planet			0
yet here they were , slugging it out from the penalty spot with lowly @entity14 in the semifinal of the @entity16 , with a place at @entity18 at stake			1
usually so composed in pressure situations , @entity3 's players blinked , four of them missing from 12 yards out as this interminable season took another turn for the worse			1
since @entity14 last won silverware in 1973 , @entity3 have won 25 domestic trophies , but before the end of january the only competition they are still in with a realistic chance of winning is the @entity29			1
yet the man who presided over the majority of those 25 trophies -- @entity33 -- has gone and the man who had replaced him is looking more beleaguered by the day			0
@entity35 trudged off the field as @entity14 players swarmed around their goalkeeper @entity38 , who saved the penalty that sent them to the final of @entity8 's second most prestigious cup competition			1
they will now face @entity43 in the final on march 2 while @entity3 , and @entity35 especially , will face more intense questioning about the direction his club is going in			1
" criticism is fair if you do n't win at this football club , " @entity35 told @entity49 after the game			2
" credit to @entity14 -- they played well and we did n't			2
we 've played well in a lot of games this season and not got the rewards but we did n't deserve any rewards tonight			0
" when we had the chances to get a second goal we did n't finish it off			0
i 've got no problem them getting through -- they deserved it			0
" in the end , @entity3 were fortunate to force the game into penalties after goalkeeper @entity70 fumbled a shot from @entity72 into the net -- a gaffe that appeared to have handed @entity14 victory in the final seconds of the game			1
luckily for the @entity82 keeper , just 60 seconds later a dramatic goal from @entity78 with practically the last kick of the match gave united one last shot at redemption			0
one which they could n't take			0
of @entity70 's mistake @entity35 said : " @entity35 's been really good this season			2
people do make mistakes but it was a costly one			0
that 's football and that 's the way it is just now			0
" of the four missed penalties from his side @entity35 simply added : " that was poor			2
" trailing 2 - 1 from the first leg , @entity3 took the lead on 37 minutes through @entity100 to level the scores on aggregate			1
but with no more goals at the end of 90 minutes the match went into extra time			0
knowing they needed to score to go through @entity14 piled men forward in search of a winner but no - one at @entity111 could have been prepared for the tumult that was to come			1
@entity72 , who spent five years as a @entity3 player , fired in a low shot from outside the box that @entity70 found too hot to handle			2
as @entity14 's players celebrated in front of their 9,000 traveling fans , @entity35 rolled his eyes as the prospect of a @entity18 final ebbed away			1
but just over 60 seconds later it was @entity3 's fans celebrating as @entity78 turned in a cross to lock the scores up on aggregate and send the tie to penalties			1
with the tension around the stadium palpable , the first three players to take spot kicks missed , before @entity133 put @entity3 1 - 0 up			1
but that was the only success @entity3 would register from 12 yards as successful penalties from @entity136 and @entity137 put @entity14 2 - 1 in front , either side of an @entity141 miss. @entity142 was the next player to go wide , ballooning his effort over the bar , before @entity14 's @entity145 squandered the opportunity to settle the tie			1
all of which meant @entity149 had to score to keep @entity3 in the match , but his spot kick was saved by @entity38 , sparking wild scenes of celebration from the visitors			2
@entity14 manager @entity155 , who is battling to keep his side in the @entity157 , told @entity49 : " this feeling is for the fans			2
it has been a difficult season but look at them now , this is for them			0
" to have a day of football like today is great for everybody and great for football			0
it is a great story -- let 's see if we can go one better			0
" the things that happened today were incredible but the players were outstanding , they are trying hard to learn so credit to them			0

@entity3 *knocked* out of @entity16 by lowly @entity14
@entity14 win on penalties after a dramatic finale to the semifinal tie at @entity111
four @entity3 players miss in the shootout as @entity14 win 2 - 1
result heaps pressure on beleaguered @entity3 manager @entity35
