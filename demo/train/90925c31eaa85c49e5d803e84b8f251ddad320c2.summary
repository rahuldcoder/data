@entity5 , @entity3 the rattle of ice in a stainless steel shaker heralds the first mojito of the day			1
it comes courtesy of the award - winning cocktail waitress at @entity11 ! , a private restaurant run by 41 - year - old @entity3 entrepreneur @entity12			1
" the recipe for success is maintaining the real taste of @entity3 , whether that 's in the food and drink or our taste for life , " he told me			1
businesses like @entity12 's are among the most visible examples of economic reforms -- that are fueling small , private enterprise -- already launched by president @entity28			0
@entity12 , a former sommelier at @entity5 's famed @entity29 , says he set up his own business just over two years ago in a house owned by his cousin and financed with his own savings and some investment from relatives in the @entity36			1
now small businesses like his could get substantial new cash injections thanks to measures announced by president @entity40 , which came into effect friday			0
among the changes , it will be easier for @entity36 -- and their spending money -- to come to @entity3			1
@entity3 authorities and tourism industry experts estimate that could open the door to 1 million @entity36 visitors a year , added to the expected 3 million international tourists from other parts of the world			1
equally significant , the @entity40 administration has approved a four-fold increase in remittances from @entity57 to their families in @entity3 and no upper limit on remittances destined to fund small business			1
unveiling the changes to @entity36 trade and travel policy on december 17 , @entity40 said : " we 're calling on @entity3 to unleash the potential of 11 million @entity3 by ending unnecessary resistance to their political , social and economic activities			1
" predictably the decision drew fire from some @entity36 republicans who thought the easing of restrictions would put more money into the hands of the @entity3 government , the @entity36 ' longstanding @entity79 foe			1
but perhaps @entity40 's decision over time could prove to be a backdoor to generating change on the island			0
@entity36 economist @entity85 , a former adviser to president @entity86 , once said : " economic freedom is an indispensable means to the achievement of political freedom			1
" now , with @entity40 's changes , some ordinary @entity3 could gain higher incomes because they work in the growing tourist sector , could set up private businesses , or could receive higher - value remittances from families in the @entity36			1
others may be left behind , unable to make ends meet on meager state - sector wages , currently running around $ 20 a month			2
as economic divisions are exacerbated , so is the chance of growing political divisions that could ultimately chip away at @entity3 's socialist system			1
restaurant owner @entity12 , however , does n't seem concerned			0
" if salaries start to rise and more remittances come in , then great			0
in @entity3 we do n't pay much attention to who is a first - , second - or third - class citizen			1
but if that starts to happen we 'll have to see how we deal with it , " he said			0
@entity12 is already considering the possibility of new outlets and has patented his @entity11 ! trade name with a view to possible franchise options			0
but he is convinced liberalization must be gradual and orderly			0
he does not favor a free - for - all			2
he says all his 20 staff are affiliated to the @entity3 labor federation , @entity120 , and march in the @entity122 parade to @entity5 's @entity123			2
@entity12 is a firm believer that @entity3 government reforms coupled with a bigger influx of @entity36 dollars will not undermine @entity3 socialism			1
across @entity5 , at a very different type of private business , nail salon owner @entity129 has a very different viewpoint			0
at 29 she has never worked for the state			0
she charges around $ 5 as she works quickly but precisely smoothing then painting claw - like acrylic nails			2
she seems to have a well - established clientele who drop by a side room in her ground floor apartment in @entity5			2
@entity129 expresses very little patience for @entity3 's socialist system and perhaps surprisingly is not afraid to speak her mind			2
" i am one of the capitalist generation			0
i 've never worked for the state and i believe that the capitalist generation is better than the other , " she said			0
until fairly recently , such talk would have run her the risk of being branded a counter-revolutionary by her neighbors			0
@entity129 is unabashed when she suggests her generation has little time for talk of the @entity152			0
" all that business of @entity154 and the @entity155 is a very pretty story but it 's got nothing to do with now , " she said			0
young people want to go to good places , a disco , an all - expenses paid hotel and with a state salary you just ca n't do that			2
" above her workstation , @entity129 has scratched a sign into the fluorescent light fitting			0
" a warning that @entity3 's once - cherished dream of forging an egalitarian society may be dimming .			1

@entity3 entrepreneurs hope @entity36 - @entity3 policy changes mean more chance to make money
they are confident and say they 're ready for the *challenges*
