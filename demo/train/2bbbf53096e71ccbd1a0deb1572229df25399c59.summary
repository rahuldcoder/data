@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 does n't have a booth at the @entity5 , but the company 's @entity7 software is practically everywhere			1
as expected , smartphones maintain a major presence at @entity5			2
despite @entity13 and @entity14 showcasing their wares , the announcements and excitement is all around @entity3 's @entity7			1
every new @entity17 smartphone and tablet announced by the four major cellular carriers at or during @entity5 runs on @entity7			1
@entity20 showcased four smartphones at a news event on thursday -- @entity24 's revolution , @entity26 's @entity25 , @entity28 's @entity27 and a yet - to - be - named offering from @entity30			2
touch - screen tablets were also on display with @entity30 's @entity33 and @entity28 's @entity34			2
all six mobile devices , which are slated for release in the first half of the year starting as early as march , run on @entity7			1
" at the same time that we were building out the [ @entity17 ] area @entity43 , the @entity7 operating system really became a reality , " @entity20 ceo @entity38 said in an interview on thursday			1
@entity46 announced three smartphones on wednesday , which take advantage of the carriers ' latest network protocol			2
all three , from @entity28 's @entity51 , @entity26 's @entity52 and @entity30 's @entity17 , were @entity53			1
@entity54 unveiled two new tablets -- @entity56 and @entity57 7 -- but no new smartphones at its event			0
both tablets were running @entity7			2
during the week of @entity5 , @entity61 announced one new phone , the @entity63 from @entity26 , which runs on -- take a guess			1
at @entity14 's booth , the company showcases mainly the @entity67 , alongside @entity69 phones that are already on the market			2
when questioned on phones , @entity14 co-ceo @entity71 reiterated that the company is hard at work on the next iteration of @entity69			0
it 's based on the operating system that runs the @entity67 , and these " super phones , " as he reportedly called them , will have fast dual - core processors inside			0
but @entity81 leapt past @entity14 with an @entity7 phone that packs a dual - core chip			1
thanks to the added processing power , the @entity51 can dock to a monitor or laptop shell to become a desktop computer running a modified version of @entity7			2
for @entity13 ceo @entity92 's @entity5 keynote , he focused the @entity94 presentation on applications -- now totally more than 5,500 -- instead of new hardware			1
perhaps that 's because carrier partners had nothing new to show			0
@entity92 concluded the phone portion of his keynote by announcing a new feature coming soon : copy - and - paste , something every major competitor already offers			0
needless to say , the crowd was not impressed			0
on display at its booth , @entity13 had many of the nine @entity94 devices that are already available in stores			0
though the company did n't announce new phones , a @entity13 mobile director told the @entity114 that @entity94 products would be available on @entity20 and @entity61 by june 30			1
" we 're going to be a multiple operating - system company , " @entity20 's @entity38 said			0
" we have a strong business relationship with @entity13			0
we are interested in that			0
" @entity119 : share your stories from @entity5 the variety of phone types that carriers offer is one area of competition			1
" not only do we have every major operating system , " said @entity46 marketing chief @entity127 at his company 's wednesday conference , " but we have the best smartphones for those operating systems			0
" despite these statements of breadth , @entity7 was practically the only act in town this week			1
last year , @entity3 had a table at one of the three main nightly events associated with @entity5			1
this year , the company just held a small party and rented a private meeting room			0
@entity3 is leaving it to the manufacturers to evangelize its platform			2
expecting to make money from ads , @entity3 provides @entity7 for free to gadget makers to install , tinker with and sell on phones			1
@entity13 charges partners to use @entity94 and places limits on how they can alter the software			0
@entity14 does n't license its software			0
nor does @entity153 , which did n't announce any new products or host a booth , though the company is here in @entity0 for various small events			1
@entity158 , another major smartphone maker and a longtime holdout from @entity5 , also does n't license software to vendors			1
@entity162 , like the aforementioned three , develops software only for its own hardware			0
at @entity5 two years ago , the company made a huge splash with the @entity167			2
this year , however , @entity162 has a tiny footprint at displays for its new parent company , @entity170			0
no new phones were shown			0
( @entity170 is holding an event focused on @entity162 software scheduled for next month			0
) with tablets , @entity7 is clearly rising as a top choice for manufacturers , but it 's not alone			2
@entity14 has its own , and many companies are announcing tablets with @entity179			0
the version of @entity7 made for tablets is n't ready to be demonstrated live , and only two companies say they have products to support it			1
others are showcasing @entity7 tablets , but they are based on older @entity3 software that was made for phones , which obviously have smaller screens			1
in smartphones , competitors will likely take the stage later this year to shine the spotlight on themselves			0
but at @entity5 , @entity7 is the star .			1

@entity3 does n't have a booth at @entity5 , but its mobile products are practically everywhere
during carriers ' @entity17 phone and tablet announcements , only @entity53 were there
smartphone makers like @entity7 because it 's free for them to use
