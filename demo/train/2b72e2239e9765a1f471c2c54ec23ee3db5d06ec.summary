-- @entity1 is a cautionary tale for conservatives this year			1
and those @entity4 who always argue that their party wins when it moves further to the right are going to have a lot of explaining to do after @entity8			2
polls show that " teavangelist " attorney general @entity10 is going down to a decisive defeat in the governor 's race against an exceptionally flawed @entity15 candidate , @entity14 , the former @entity16 chairman and @entity18 fund - raiser			1
the reason is simple : @entity10 is too extreme for swing voters in @entity1 -- and that neatly symbolizes the @entity4 's problem as it looks to the congressional midterms of 2014 and the presidential campaign of 2016			1
the problems have been long brewing in @entity1			2
once a @entity4 bastion , the @entity26 began to turn from red to purple in 2008 when @entity30 became the first @entity31 to win the state since @entity33 in 1964			2
but in true swing state fashion , @entity1 turned around and elected conservative @entity36 governor in 2009 ; he managed to win by 17 points , cloaking his conservatism in a family - friendly demeanor			1
@entity30 won the state again in 2012 , buoyed by demographic changes and the increasing wealth in the region around @entity43			0
nonetheless , a centrist @entity4 might still have been well - positioned to win @entity1 's governorship in this off - year election			1
but that does not remotely describe @entity10			2
a tea party favorite and self - described " @entity51 - supporting @entity50 right - to - life home - school dad , " @entity10 has built a political career on a foundation of strident social conservatism			2
proclaiming " homosexuality is wrong , " supporting abstinence - only sex education and devoting himself to abortion restrictions as a matter of faith and law , @entity10 has been eager to use political office to advance an ideological agenda			2
as attorney general he sued to stop the implementation of the @entity66 , challenged the @entity68 's fuel - efficiency standards , backed the controversial @entity70 illegal immigration law and issued a legal opinion that sexual orientation should not be included in nondiscrimination statutes for the @entity74			0
his extreme play - to - the - base conservative reputation was only accelerated by the selection at the state convention of @entity79 as his running mate for lieutenant governor			0
he 's an @entity82 evangelical pastor with a knack for saying things such as the following : @entity15 are " anti-christian , @entity86 , anti-family , anti-life and anti-god " ; " liberalism and their ideas have done more to kill black folks whom they claim so much to love than the @entity91 , lynching and slavery and @entity93 ever did , " and " @entity30 clearly has @entity95 sensibilities			0
he sees the world and @entity97 from a @entity95 perspective			0
" add this all together and you have the most far - right statewide ticket in recent memory			0
not surprisingly , centrists and other swing voters are looking elsewhere			1
libertarian candidate @entity105 is polling a respectable 10 % -- an indication of the political costs that come from such strident social conservatism , even among fellow travelers on the center - right			0
women voters are supporting @entity14 by 20 % -- a cavernous gap that reflects @entity10 's social conservative obsession			1
against almost any other @entity4 , @entity14 would be vulnerable , but not @entity10			1
october 's @entity4 - driven government shutdown caused @entity10 to play defense , reversing longtime rhetoric by suddenly denouncing the effort to force a delay in @entity66 's implementation and even refusing to be photographed with sen. @entity120 for fear of further alienating swing voters			1
at the gubernatorial debates , the defiant culture warrior was reduced to bleating about the importance of bipartisanship and compromise -- laugh lines if you knew the first thing about @entity10 's record			1
@entity10 's problems must be seen side by side with the success of another @entity4 running for governor -- @entity138			1
the @entity140 incumbent is cruising to re-election by a broad margin in a state where only 20 % of voters are registered republicans			0
he is narrowly winning nonwhite voters , and winning women by a 20 - point margin			0
the difference between the two candidates is self - evident -- @entity138 has governed as an unapologetic centrist @entity4 with a no - nonsense focus on fighting for fiscal discipline rather than an obsession with social conservatism			0
he has built cross-aisle coalitions , even on controversial policy proposals , and reached out beyond the base			0
he puts problem - solving ahead of partisanship or ideology			0
in other words , @entity138 is pretty much the opposite of @entity10 , and that 's why he is winning in an otherwise ugly year for republicans			1
conservatives will come up with lots of reasons why a swing state such as @entity1 seems to be slipping away			2
but let 's cut to the chase -- candidates who specialize only in playing to the base and pushing ideological absolutism lose			0
extremes are always ultimately their own side 's worst enemy			0
and @entity10 's last desperate attempts to present himself as a bipartisan problem - solver or a libertarian are really just evidence of the political bankruptcy of his position			1
for those conservatives who always argue that moving more rigidly to the right is the answer to all the @entity4 's political problems , the toxic @entity186 ticket is providing an enduring exhibit a in making the opposite case			2
it is an example of what not to do -- nationally and especially in must - win swing states such as @entity1			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity198 : @entity10 appears too extreme for swing voters in @entity1
*democrat* @entity14 would be vulnerable against almost any other @entity4 , he says
@entity198 : @entity10 's candidacy symbolizes trouble @entity4 faces in 2014 , 2016 elections
the run to the right shows what not to do nationally and in @entity1 , he says
