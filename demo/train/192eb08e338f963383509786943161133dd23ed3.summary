-- a riot on a tiny island in the @entity3 that killed no one would usually go unnoticed by the world			0
but when some 100 asylum seekers burned down their shelters in an @entity10 refugee processing center friday on @entity11 , it did not			1
instead , it drew attention to a new restrictive law made in @entity10 the same day banning " boat people " from living in the country			1
" as of today asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in @entity10 , " said prime minister @entity17 in a statement announcing the law			1
the asylum seekers did not revolt because of the new law , an immigration spokeswoman said			1
they may have not even known about it when the mayhem broke out			0
they are stuck on the island without papers for @entity10			1
the @entity31 has called the conditions on @entity11 " unbearable , " noting that asylum seekers have been gone on hunger strike before because of them			1
their alternatives : go back to where they came from , places such as @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , or wait in limbo on a lonely island			0
the unrest began as peaceful demonstrations earlier in the week , but then things got out of hand , the spokeswoman said			0
the new law will put more people in their position -- marooned on an island with little choice of where to go next			1
on saturday , @entity10 authorities intercepted the first boat smuggling refugees since the law was passed			1
it was sailing near the @entity61 and was crammed full with 81 people , who will face that fate			2
starting immediately , all " boat people " will be taken to the sparsely populated jungle island of @entity65 , which is a part of @entity67			1
@entity10 officials sunday said 15 @entity71 asylum seekers on @entity65 were returned home			1
middle of nowhere @entity11 , where the insurrection broke out , is the epitome of the middle of nowhere			1
it is roughly 2,000 miles from @entity10 's shores , where @entity17 said in no uncertain terms that " boat people " are no longer to tread			1
there is not much room to roam on @entity11			1
it is just three miles across at its widest point			0
and there are not many people to talk to			2
the nearly 600 " transferees , " as they are called , make up 5 % of the island 's total population			0
and they speak various languages from @entity93 to @entity94			0
more than 150 miles of open ocean separate them from their nearest neighbor , which is another tiny island			2
one - way street @entity65 presents a similar situation			0
people arriving there will have to wait for authorities to determine that they are true refugees , not just people seeking a better life in a richer country			2
" if they 're found to be genuine refugees , they will be resettled in @entity67 , " @entity17 said			0
@entity17 described the country in optimistic terms as " an emerging economy with a strong future			2
" those who settle there may find it to be more of a jungle island populated with mostly native peoples , as the @entity119 says			0
not much of a replacement for the immigration melting pot they had hoped for			0
@entity10 is prepared for an unlimited influx of new asylum seekers to the neighboring country , with its cooperation			1
" our governments will expand existing facilities on @entity65 , as well as establishing further facilities in @entity67 , " @entity17 said			0
" there is no cap on the number of people who can be transferred to @entity67			2
" those not recognized as legitimate refugees would be sent packing again			0
the government has kicked off an ad campaign on traditional and social media in various @entity142 languages to warn of the possibility of getting stuck in the new asylum cul - de - sac			0
it has drawn hefty criticism from some @entity10 politicians as being inhumane			2
as a consolation , if fewer boats arrive as a result of the policy , @entity10 plans to raise the number of legal asylum seekers it takes , @entity17 said			1
human trafficking and votes the new law is designed to discourage " boat people " from paying human traffickers thousands of dollars to ferry them to @entity10 on unseaworthy crafts			1
" our country has had enough of people smugglers exploiting asylum seekers and seeing them drown on the high seas , " said @entity17 , who previously served as foreign minister			1
he is also tired of watching @entity10 crews risk their lives to fish passengers from waters in front of the @entity61 , where rusting buckets carrying them invariably capsize			2
the number of illegal immigrants arriving by boat spiked between 1999 and 2001 , according to the @entity10 parliament , only to flatline after a few years			1
there has been a recent uptick , which has become an irritant to some @entity10			1
@entity17 , who heads the left - wing @entity179 , faces an election in september , and his opponent 's @entity182 has dominated in the polls			0
his party recently voted down former prime minister @entity186 who was widely unpopular and put @entity17 in her place to court favor with voters before time runs out			0
the new law , which @entity17 's government delivered , could also play well with more conservative @entity10 voters and garner @entity17 's party more votes			1
riots over back on @entity11 , things have calmed down			2
authorities have moved the asylum seekers to an alternative location and have set up tented temporary housing			1
the flames spared the kitchen , so there is food to go around for the " transferees			0
" and the rioters may face legal consequences for their actions , @entity10 's immigration minister said			2
they could wander from the refugee camp to jail			0
" the sort of crimes that appear to be committed are serious -- with prison sentences , " @entity212 said			0
but they have returned to the camp			0
there is no place else for them to go on the tiny island , or much of anywhere else			0
@entity0 's @entity223 reported from @entity224 ; @entity225 reported and wrote from @entity224			0

150 asylum seekers burned down their shelters in an @entity10 refugee center on @entity11
it drew attention to a new law in @entity10 banning " boat people " from living in the country
a recent uptick in human trafficking has become an irritant to some @entity10
with an election coming , the new law could garner more conservative votes
