@entity0 might be off to a slow start but it 's starting to pick up steam , at least in states that are not using the beleaguered @entity5 website			1
blocked out at @entity6 ? bypass on way soon , feds say for the past month , @entity8 has conducted a state - by - state survey to determine enrollment in the new insurance plans			1
as of tuesday afternoon , at least 133,257 people had chosen new insurance plans in the 14 states with their own signup apparatuses			1
nearly half of them were enrolled in the past two weeks			0
one of the biggest jumps is in @entity19			0
through november 2 , 35,364 @entity19 had selected private plans through the new insurance marketplace			2
less than two weeks later , the number was up to 59,000			0
the state with the second - highest enrollment is @entity25 , where at least 24,509 have selected a plan			0
the next highest enrollments are in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			0
bad news for woman cited as @entity0 success story enrollment is harder to pin down in the 36 states using @entity5 , although it 's running well behind the states with their own programs			1
as of november 2 , just 26,794 people had enrolled in the @entity5 states			2
@entity8 's current tally for this group is 43,743 enrollees , but that 's based on just a handful of states that have provided updates			1
in addition , 58,857 newly eligible people have enrolled in state medicaid programs , with another 275,131 people signed up to start @entity53 coverage on january 1 , 2014			0
@entity54 , healthy needed aside from raw enrollment numbers , the data are being scrutinized for any hints about the makeup of the newly insured			1
in its projections , the @entity59 estimated that 7 million people would enroll in private insurance plans through the marketplaces in 2014 , and that 2.7 million -- about 38 % of the total -- would be between the ages of 18 and 34			1
" there 's general agreement that we need younger and healthier people to offset the costs of sicker people coming into the system , " says @entity66 , a spokesman for @entity67 , an industry group			0
" that 's what will add more stability			0
" if the concentration of older and sicker enrollees in the new plans is too high , insurers could be forced to raise their rates , which would further discourage young and healthy people from signing up			1
taken to an extreme , this vicious cycle could -- in theory -- lead to what @entity0 critics call a " death spiral " and the collapse of the law			2
industry spokesman : too early to draw conclusions so , how 's it going ? it 's a limited picture			2
@entity97 has n't released demographic data for people signing up through @entity5 , and only three states provided their own data to @entity8			1
in those states , the number of under - 35 enrollees is less than @entity59 projected : in @entity29 , 19 % of enrollees are age 18 - 34			1
in @entity30 and @entity28 , the figures are 22 % and 23 % , respectively			0
but @entity66 says it 's way too early to draw conclusions			0
" there 's lots of evidence to suggest that people needing serious medical care are most likely to purchase insurance initially			2
those who do n't have urgent medical needs are more likely to purchase insurance later			0
" missing from @entity0 : working & middle class what 's more , age is only a piece of the puzzle			1
since those applying for insurance no longer disclose anything about their health , @entity66 says insurers wo n't have a good sense of their medical needs -- and what it will cost to cover them -- until well into 2014			0
obamacare architect : no risk of a ' death spiral ' the law 's supporters say the dire scenarios are farfetched			0
" there is essentially no risk of a ' death spiral , ' " says @entity140 economist @entity139 , who helped design the @entity0 as well as the @entity142 law on which it was modeled			1
" there are substantial risk mitigation mechanisms as well as subsidies that will attract in healthy enrollees			1
" most important , say @entity139 and @entity66 , is a section of the @entity0 under which the federal government will pick up a substantial portion of the losses for the next three years , if the program goes sour for insurers			2
there 's no precedent for a program of this size and scale , and @entity139 warns that that the early data are ripe for overinterpretation			1
while fewer young and healthy customers would mean higher premiums , " it 's hard to say how big a difference 28 % vs. 38 % makes -- we just do n't know			0
" the trends are likely to come into sharper focus in the next several weeks			0
most experts expect the pace of enrollment to accelerate , as the @entity5 website starts to function better and potential customers have more of a chance to explore their options			0
so far , by @entity8 's count nearly 900,000 people have completed applications for new insurance but have not yet selected a plan			1
poll suggests @entity0 could have cost @entity183 second term @entity185 : why @entity186 better hope @entity183 's lying @entity188 : chill -- obamacare snafus are fixable states slap insurers for misleading letters			2

a @entity8 survey shows an increase in enrollments in @entity0 in states not using the *troubled* website
as of tuesday , at least 133,257 people had chosen new insurance plans in those 14 states
limited , early data shows low numbers of enrollees under the age of 35
economist who helped design @entity0 says it has mechanisms to attract healthy enrollees
