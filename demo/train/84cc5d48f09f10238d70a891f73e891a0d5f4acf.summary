the popular pope @entity0 is taking some hits himself after some lighthearted comments that included a pretend punch to a colleague			1
the comments came while trying to make the point that free speech should have some limits , including on the right to insult another 's faith			1
speaking thursday to reporters on the plane ride to the @entity12 , the @entity0 gestured with a fake punch to demonstrate what he would do if someone were to say " a swear word against my mother			1
" most journalists interpreted it as a joke , not a justification of violence , especially since the @entity0 had also just forcefully stated that " one can not kill in the name of @entity24			2
" still , the @entity25 felt the need to clarify , in response to a later @entity1 question about the punch , that his words were " spoken colloquially " and consistent with the @entity0 's " free style of speech			1
" i do n't for one minute think the @entity0 is advocating for any type of violence , whether religiously motivated murder or sparring among friends who dis each other 's mamas			2
what concerns me is his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speech			1
" one can not provoke , one can not insult other people 's faith , one can not make fun of faith , " he said			2
" there is a limit			0
every religion has its dignity			0
... in freedom of expression there are limits			2
" the @entity0 , responding to a general question about the interplay between religious liberty and free expression , was clearly referencing the massacre of journalists at @entity64 magazine by @entity66 militants in @entity67 last week			1
although he did not say the slain cartoonists brought the attack upon themselves because of their satirical criticism of @entity72 , it 's not a huge logical leap to that conclusion and raises the likelihood of such a misinterpretation			0
let 's just say it 's not what most public relations professionals would advise			0
and while the @entity0 has been known to talk more informally with reporters on the papal plane ( his " who am i to judge ? " comment about gay @entity84 came on the return flight from @entity86 in 2013 ) , he 's still on the record and obviously aware that his words will be reported and analyzed			1
the @entity0 is not the only prominent @entity91 raising the issue			2
@entity93 , a self - appointed spokesman fighting " anti-catholicism " as the president of the @entity96 - based @entity95 , released a statement with the headline , " muslims have a right to be angry , " on the day of the killings			0
on thursday , his statement was headlined : " @entity0 sides with @entity95			2
while no one can match the offensive tone of @entity93 , who actually said @entity64 's @entity114 " did n't understand the role he played in his own death , " the gist of the @entity0 's message was the same : criticism of religion is problematic			1
as an aside , i 'll be curious to see if those who slammed @entity93 have the same harsh words for the @entity0			0
perhaps both of them should take a lesson from the response of another @entity124 , @entity125 , president of @entity127 , a progressive , evangelical community and publication			0
he had a different suggestion for how people of faith should respond to the @entity67 attacks : " @entity133 tells us to bless those who persecute us , to return love for hate and good for evil , and even to love our enemies , " @entity125 wrote			0
" loving your enemies certainly includes supporting the foundational commitment to free speech , and defending the right of free speech , even , or especially , for those who offend you			1
" i think most @entity147 catholics agree that while blasphemy -- offensive speech against @entity24 or religion -- is not particularly nice , it does not follow that it can or should be regulated or outlawed			1
in the @entity147 , the @entity152 outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952			0
i 'm hoping the @entity0 was only offering counsel to his followers , rather than advocating for any sort of legal position			0
no one has the right not to be offended			0

@entity161 : @entity0 told reporters one ca n't insult others ' faith , expression must have limits
she says he seems to believe religion should have special protections on free speech
@entity161 : most @entity147 @entity84 likely disagree -- no one has right not to be offended , even @entity0
