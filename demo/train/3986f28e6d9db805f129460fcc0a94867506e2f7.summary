@entity0 -- @entity3 's lips are firmly sealed about her @entity4 " @entity10 " moment four days ago , which could be seen as evidence that it was a stunt to promote her new movie			1
" what do you think ? " @entity3 replied wednesday night at a " to do list " screening			2
the actress ran onstage sunday as @entity16 began his acceptance speech for the @entity18			1
while holding a drink in one hand , she grabbed his golden popcorn bucket trophy with the other in a not - so - convincing struggle to get it			2
@entity4 quickly promoted the " incident , " while officially denying it was staged and insisting that @entity24 was expelled from the audience			1
the network 's website posted a story headlined " did @entity10 inspire @entity3 's @entity29 ? " @entity10 's interruption of @entity34 's speech at the 2009 @entity35 -- in which he made it clear he thought @entity37 deserved the honor more -- was soon followed by an apology tour			1

" he announced that he would " take some time off " to think about how to " make it through the rest of this life			0
" in fact , his planned three - month tour with @entity49 was cut short			0
but @entity24 is offering no apology , confession or explanation			1
her only public comment was a tweet posted monday : " thanks for the advice @ kanyewest went better than planned ! " was the struggle staged , but not with everyone looped in , so that @entity4 could deny it was a stunt without lying ? @entity24 was given the front - row center seat closest to @entity16 , whom she said she 's " known for a long time			1
" the camera did zoom in on her after she sat back down , giving viewers a clear shot of " @entity68 " scribbled across her chest			0
" that 's an interesting theory , " @entity3 said			1
" i like that one			0
" did she do it because the best way to get a @entity76 entertainment reporter to write about her is with bad behavior ? " is that true ? " she said			0
as if she did n't know			0
can she reveal anything people do n't know ? " i can play the saxophone , " she said			0
" that 's something surprising that people do n't know about me			2
" it would " be a dream come true " to play sax at the @entity35 , she said			0
why wait to be invited ? you could jump up on stage			0
" that 's true , " she said .			2
