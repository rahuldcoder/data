more than 70 others were injured by the quake			2
it struck early monday morning			1
it had a magnitude of 5.9 , so not as powerful as some of the tremors recently we 've seen from @entity38 and from @entity39 , but like those earthquakes , this one was followed by dozens of aftershocks			2

relief efforts are already getting going			2
one official said residents " are sad , but they are calm			1
" he added that the country is meeting the victims ' needs			2
just to give you some background , @entity4 was established as a country in 1923 from part of what remained of the @entity80			1
it 's home to about 77 million people			1
it 's also no stranger to powerful earthquakes			1
in 1999 , two quakes hit near @entity87 , @entity4 's largest city			1
those killed at least 20,000 people			2
monday 's tremor hit near the point where two major fault lines meet			1
it 's an area that some scientists describe as unstable			1
is this legit ? @entity95 , @entity16 : is this legit ? @entity6 is east of @entity8			1
legit ! the two countries share a border that 's more than 1,500 miles long			1
@entity99 @entity24 : the @entity100 , a militant , @entity101 group you 've heard a lot about lately has caused violence in both of those countries , and it says it 's responsible for this suicide bombing in @entity6			1
the attack happened in @entity5 , @entity6 's second - largest city			1
it 's located on the opposite side of the country from @entity8			1
the blast targeted a law enforcement agency			2
it killed at least a dozen people , injured more than a hundred others			2
many of those victims were being treated at nearby hospitals			0
a spokesman for the @entity6 @entity100 said the attack was a response to what he called @entity50 aggression against @entity124 around the world			0
a @entity6 official says the @entity100 is trying to destabilize the country			0
but the government , he says , will not let them succeed			0
@entity129 @entity24 : hopping back over that border to @entity8 , where @entity50 defense secretary @entity131 made an unscheduled visit yesterday			1
secretary @entity131 said part of the reason he was there was to get an update on @entity137			0
we 've told you a lot about that in recent weeks			0
@entity137 is a military offensive against the @entity100 ; it 's focused on the city of @entity7			1
@entity131 arrived in the capital city of @entity145 on monday			0
he was scheduled to meet with @entity129 president @entity146 as well as general @entity147 , the top @entity50 commander in @entity8			1
during the visit , the defense secretary said @entity7 is just part of the fight			1
@entity50 defense secretary @entity131 : of course , the operation in @entity7 is only one of many battles to come in a much longer campaign focused on protecting the people of @entity8			1
@entity24 : the day before @entity131 arrived in @entity8 , president @entity146 , along with @entity147 , went to @entity7 to talk to the people there about the fight against the @entity100			1
@entity161 has more on that			0
( begin video ) @entity164 , @entity165 correspondent : president @entity146 traveled to @entity7 to tell its population the @entity100 would not be coming back			1
hundreds filled a mosque to hear him speak and to tell him what they thought			0
they did n't hold back			0
they demanded schools , roads , hospitals and an honest police force			0
the president promised to rebuild their town			1
@entity146 , @entity8 president : i heard them			1
they had some very legitimate complaints			0
they felt as if they were abandoned which , in many cases , is true			0
gen. @entity147 , commander , @entity191 : what i heard today is frustrations with things that people are going to be frustrated with war			1
but there 's always frustration with the costs of war and how we operate			1
black : @entity147 's strategy is at work here : push the @entity100 out , then stay and hold the ground while local government , police and services are established			1
but the population is skeptical			0
the @entity100 have been cleared out before and allowed to return			0
( @entity210 ) @entity211 @entity212 , @entity16 : time for the shoutout ! what is this activity better known as ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it called : a ) @entity222 , b ) @entity221 , c ) popping or @entity224 ) stepping ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! what you just saw was an example of stepping ! that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! stepping controversy @entity24 : stepping 's been part of african - american culture for decades , especially on college campuses			1
around 16 years ago , one sorority at a university in @entity236 taught the members of another sorority how to step			1
but when that second sorority took the title at a national competition last month , it stepped into the middle of controversy			1
@entity245 explains why and what happened afterward			0
( begin video ) @entity245 , @entity0 anchor : this is stepping , a proud mix of tribal dance infusing military drills and popular culture			1
dominated by @entity255 fraternities and sororities for decades , until the ladies of @entity236 's @entity258 , an all - white team , stepped into a national competition and nailed it			1
@entity261 , @entity262 , radio personality : who do you all think it is ? that 's right			2
zetas , @entity269 , @entity271 , first place			0
@entity273 : their win stunned the crowd of nearly 5,000 people			0
the emcee told the audience , do n't be so surprised			0
@entity280 : i saw you			0
you 're like ... stepping is for everybody			2
if you can step , you can step			2
@entity273 : then came @entity285 and worldwide reaction			0
some said it was cultural theft : " i wish you white people would stop stealing everything from us			0
can we just have one thing for ourselves ? " " stepping is for us , not them			2
" others saw it differently , writing " imitation is the sincerest form of flattery			0
" " black , white , green , purple , who cares ? this is good stuff by young people who have worked hard			0
" @entity306 , a former stepper , was at the show and understands why people are so passionate			0
@entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 : a lot of people might feel as though someone who did n't , does not have this background , how could they truly understand what it means to be out there stepping ? at the same time , it could , on the other hand , it can make you happy to see that stepping is starting to go further than just @entity255			1
@entity273 : now adding to the intrigue , nearly a week after the competition , organizers said there was a scoring discrepancy			0
so , first place that originally went to the @entity269 , will now be shared with the @entity328 from @entity329			0
they share the title , but not the money			0
they both get $ 100,000 in scholarships			0
@entity245 , @entity0 , @entity335			0
( @entity210 ) @entity336 @entity24 : this is the kind of story we love to hear your opinions on			0
we want you to head to our web page , @entity343			0
click on our blog , from a to @entity346 , to share your thoughts			0
should stepping be exclusive ? should everyone be able to take part ? we want to know what you think			2
and remember , we only want to see your first names on our blog			0
legos for @entity38 @entity24 : in @entity355 , @entity356 , dozens of young people are involved in a contest that 's all about building something out of @entity359			1
every participant has to pay an entry fee , but the winners do n't get any money for a very good reason			0
@entity365 , @entity366 : we were trying to find a way to raise money for @entity38			2
@entity24 : and so far they 've raised more than $ 1,700 ! the little guy you saw there , @entity372 , he 's the one who came up with the idea for a @entity359 contest			1
and it 's inspiring similar events in @entity379 and @entity380 , the money going to help feed young @entity38			2
before we go @entity24 : all right , we never like to leave you without something kind of off the wall , so before we go today , our last story : we want you to brace yourselves , ' cause this is gon na get ugly			2
that is what @entity389 does best			0
the rough - looking rover won this ugly dog contest in @entity379			2
but it 's not all about repelling pooches			2
there were prizes for best costume			0
we assume he battered the competition			0
and if this guy did n't take home the title for coolest canine , we 're gon na ask for a recount			0
of course , all of this is for a good cause ; it 's to raise money for local animal charities			2
