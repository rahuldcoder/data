two members of @entity2 punk band @entity1 , who were serving two - year jail terms for their part in a performance critical of @entity2 president @entity7 , have been released from prison			1
@entity9 and @entity10 were released about two months before their prison sentences were due to end			1
the release was approved last week when @entity2 lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law announced by @entity7			1
" two months out of the almost two years that the girls have served is not much , " @entity10 's husband , @entity15 , told @entity16			1
" so the effect of this amnesty for @entity9 and @entity10 is not really felt			1
" the @entity2 government said the amnesty marked the anniversary of the adoption of @entity2 's @entity24 constitution in 1993			1
but @entity10 , released from a @entity26 facility on monday , told @entity16 she felt that the amnesty was a publicity stunt to bolster the government 's image before it hosts the @entity29 in february			1
@entity15 said much the same			0
" president @entity7 obviously used this amnesty option to ( brighten ) up his image before the @entity33 , " @entity15 said			2
@entity2 's record on human rights is in the spotlight as the country prepares to host the @entity38 in @entity39			2
@entity1 's 2012 performance of a " punk prayer " that criticized @entity7 , who was prime minister at the time , was held at a @entity45 cathedral			1
the musicians were found guilty of hooliganism			0
@entity10 went on a hunger strike during her prison term to protest what she said were poor conditions at a @entity53 prison			2
in october , she was transferred to a @entity26 facility for medical treatment , and she remained there until her release monday			0
she said monday that she is eager to help @entity2 prisoners by calling attention to conditions they face			0
but first , she said , she is looking forward to reuniting with family , including her 5 - year - old daughter in @entity63			0
in a lengthy letter in september to the news site @entity66 ( a translated version was published in @entity69 's @entity68 ) , @entity10 described " slave labor " and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury for up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties			2
@entity10 wrote that her life was once threatened and other prisoners told her she was not beaten only because of the celebrity her case has brought her			0
others are not so lucky , she said			0
prison authorities told state news agency @entity83 then that @entity10 was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment			0
@entity9 and @entity10 have young children and therefore qualified for the amnesty , @entity2 media reported			1
the new amnesty law is also expected to free some detained @entity91 activists			1
@entity92 , a former oil tycoon and @entity94 critic , was released from a lengthy period in prison last week after a pardon from @entity7			2
@entity92 had been in prison since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud			0
he was due for release next year .			0

@entity10 says she *believes* her release is *pre-olympics* publicity stunt
