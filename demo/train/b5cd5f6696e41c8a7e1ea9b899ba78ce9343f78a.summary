a former @entity1 football player has become the first to sue the university over an 18 - year academic scandal that kept athletes eligible to play sports by taking classes that never met			1
@entity7 was a football player who lost his eligibility in 2011 when he was accused of getting too much help with a paper , and was one of the first athletes revealed to have taken part in " paper classes , " for which the only requirement was completing a single paper			1
now he 's suing the university in federal court , saying @entity1 broke its promise to give him an education in return for playing sports			1
his lawsuit is a class - action suit that the other 3,100 students who enrolled in the fake classes -- nearly half of whom are athletes -- could easily join			1
" from selection of a major to selection of courses , the @entity1 football program controlled football student - athletes ' academic track , with the sole purpose of ensuring that football student - athletes were eligible to participate in athletics , rather than actually educating them , " says his lawsuit , filed thursday by the law firms of @entity32 , @entity33 & @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37 and @entity38 in @entity39 " @entity1 has reaped substantial profits from football student - athletes ' performance for the school , but it has not provided them a legitimate education in return			1
as such , @entity1 has breached its contract with @entity58 and @entity59 members , in violation of @entity36 common law , " wrote his attorney , @entity60 , who is also a professor of law at the @entity61			0
on monday , the school responded to the suit : " the @entity1 at @entity66 became aware friday of the lawsuit filed by former student @entity68			2
the @entity1 will reserve further comment until we 've had the opportunity to fully review the claims , " said @entity69 , associate vice chancellor for communications and public affairs at @entity1			0
@entity7 's story @entity7 , who spoke to @entity77 earlier this year , says he was recruited by many schools as a high school senior but chose @entity1 because he was promised a good education			1
" when the coaches and academic staff came to my house all the way in @entity88 , you know they , they was n't even talking football , they was talking academics , " he told @entity77 earlier this year			0
" so they were saying , ' you know what , we ca n't promise your son that he 's going to go to the @entity97 , but one thing that we can promise him is that he will get a college degree			0
' " that did n't happen			0
@entity7 lost his eligibility and never graduated , caught up in the paper class scandal that was known to and used by about two dozen administrators , according to a scathing independent report released last month			1
@entity7 was a pretty good student , but his grades and test scores fell much below the average student admitted to @entity1 , a top national public school with a reputation for rigorous academics and selective admission			1
@entity7 's high school @entity111 was 2.9			1
most admitted @entity1 students have high school gpas between 3.6 and 4.3 , according to the school 's website			2
the report last month by former federal prosecutor @entity118 followed an eight - month investigation and confirmed what whistleblowers had been saying : many student athletes were admitted to play sports when they were underprepared for college classes at @entity1			1
@entity7 told @entity77 earlier this year that he felt he was scapegoated in 2011 , when he was kicked off the team for cheating			0
since 2011 , when the fraud first came to light , the university has refused to acknowledge that members of the academic support staff knew about the paper classes and funneled athletes into them in the way that @entity7 described			2
he insisted they did know , and his story matched that of whistleblower @entity138 , who was also disregarded by the university administration for years and is also suing the school			0
@entity1 in january : we failed students ' for years ' @entity7 told @entity77 he had expressed interest in studying criminal justice , but was told on his first day of scheduling that he had to pick from three majors that fit his football schedule -- exercise and @entity149 , communications , and @entity151 , where the paper class scandal existed			1
@entity7 said his predetermined schedule included some of the paper classes			2
the report done by @entity118 , a partner with @entity157 , found that many of the things @entity7 told @entity77 were true			2
there were , the report said , nearly 30 staffers and administrators who knew about the paper classes , including @entity7 's academic advisor , @entity166			1
then - head football coach @entity167 also acknowledged knowing about the scheme			0
" i lost an education			0
i lost trust in the school -- someone i thought had my best interest			0
i definitely lost out on two seasons of football which would have put me in a better situation than i am now , " @entity7 told @entity77 shortly after @entity118 's report was made public			1
in the suit , @entity60 asks that a judge appoint someone to make sure that student athletes are no longer forced into certain majors as a condition of playing sports			0
" we 're not trying to vilify @entity1 , we 're trying to restore one of its greatest traditions , " @entity60 said			0
it also seeks some kind of relief for the athletes like @entity7 who did not get the education they were promised			2
" now the key is trying to make it right for those student athletes who were done wrong , " @entity60 said			0
what this could mean @entity7 's lawsuit could potentially uncover even more than the damning @entity198 investigation , which was by far the most thorough and provided a slew of information that had previously been discounted by @entity1			1
the difference is in the power of subpoena			0
@entity7 's lawyers will be able to depose people who declined to talk to @entity198 -- potentially key participants whom @entity118 called out for refusing to cooperate , like the former director of football @entity207 and the former interim head football coach @entity209			1
@entity209 is now a coach at @entity210 and @entity207 is in academics at @entity212			0
the former associate dean and director of the men 's basketball team , @entity217 , and another counselor for football , @entity220 , also refused to cooperate , according to the @entity222 report			2
@entity138 , who is suing @entity1 in a whistleblower - related lawsuit , said she also hopes to depose people who were not interviewed by @entity118 's team , such as members of the board of trustees			2
" there 's still a lot of denial , and @entity118 did not conduct his investigation with anyone under oath , nor did he have subpoena power , " @entity138 said .			0
