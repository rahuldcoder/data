-- " @entity1 to love and pleasure : a @entity6 's @entity5 " was pulled from @entity4 , a spokesman confirmed thursday , after thousands of users posted angry comments and threats to boycott the site			1
the self - published e-book was available on the site for download until late wednesday for $ 4.79			1
@entity15 spokesman @entity14 would not comment on the controversy or respond to questions about the company 's guidelines for digital publication			1
on wednesday , @entity4 defended selling the book in response to a report published on @entity24			1
" @entity4 believes it is censorship not to sell certain books simply because we or others believe their message is objectionable			1
@entity4 does not support or promote hatred or criminal acts , however , we do support the right of every individual to make their own purchasing decisions			1
" before it disappeared from the site wednesday night , the listing had more than 2,000 user comments			1
the vast majority of them condemned the book 's stated content , as well as @entity4 's decision to make it available			1
" it is illegal to molest children , and for @entity4 to promote such is insane			2
i 'm an abuse survivor , and am outraged @entity4 would choose to promote this nonsense			2
i will not be purchasing anything from your website until this is removed , " one user wrote in a comment that summed up the feelings of many others			0
in its product description , the book 's author described it as " my attempt to make pedophile situations safer for those juveniles that find themselves involved in them , by establishing certian [ sic ] rules for these adults to follow			2
" " i hope to achieve this by appealing to the better nature of pedosexuals , with hope that their doing so will result in less hatred and perhaps liter [ sic ] sentences should they ever be caught , " he said			0
author @entity72 told @entity0 that he published " the @entity1 " to address what he considers unfair portrayals of pedophiles in the media			2
" true pedophiles love children and would never hurt them , " the @entity78 , @entity79 , man said in a phone interview wednesday night			2
@entity72 , 47 , told @entity0 that he has not had sexual contact with a child as an adult , but did when he was a teenager			0
he also said he " was introduced to oral sex when i was 7 " by an older female , but did not provide specifics			0
a small contingent of @entity4 users defended the author 's right to free speech , and a discussion on the site titled " why @entity4 is @entity99 " delved into the constitutional implications of the controversy			1
others floated the possibility that the e-book was a hoax or a law enforcement trap for pedophiles			2
" while i think 99.9 percent of us object to pedophilia ( even though i think this particular book was a publicity stunt / joke ) , i think we can all agree that we do n't want someone else censoring a subject matter that we may be interested in			0
religion , atheism , homosexuality , etc. are some subjects that spring to mind ... and they have been censored in the past until we realized that it 's best to let all information in ( even if we do n't like some of it ) , rather than allow some authority or individual decide what we can and ca n't know about based on their own opinions or motivations , " one user wrote			0
in its form as a written piece , " the @entity1 " is protected under the @entity130 right to free speech , @entity0 legal analyst @entity126 said			1
child pornography is illegal as images			0
but text , which can be considered " works of advocacy , " has won protection in the courts under the @entity130 , @entity126 said			0
" there is an argument that some works of advocacy are incitement , but the courts have been very , very narrow in interpreting that as a crime , " @entity126 said			0
" i think this one is well safe under the protection of the @entity130			0
" @entity0 's @entity147 and @entity148 contributed to this report .			0

" @entity152 " no *longer* on @entity4 , spokesman confirms
by late wednesday , the listing had received thousands of angry comments
users *threatened* to boycott @entity4 until it pulled the self - published e-book
some users supported author 's right to free speech
