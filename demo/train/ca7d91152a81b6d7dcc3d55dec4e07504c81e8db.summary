before @entity1 , there was the flu -- the @entity3 flu of 1918 , which burned rapidly through army barracks , refugee camps , troop ships , all the crowded high - risk zones that @entity8 created			1
some people think it came out of @entity11			2
the first @entity13 cases developed there			2
soldiers from army camps like @entity16 , in eastern @entity11 , carried the virus to other camps around the @entity13 , and over the sea to @entity20			2
the flu of 1918 - 1919 came toward the end of the @entity8 -- which began a century ago this year -- and it killed more people than died in that conflict , more people than the @entity25 , back in the 14th century			1
in fact , nobody knows exactly how many people died around the world ; the estimates go all the way up to 100 million , which would have been 5 % of the world 's population			1
opinion : how a century - old war affects you if you lost a son in uniform in 1918 , you were equally likely to lose him to the flu as to enemy bullets ; half of the @entity13 servicemen who died were killed by the flu			1
after the virus started spreading in @entity46 , infecting and killing people in a number of countries , it was thoroughly described in the @entity3 press -- because the @entity51 got sick , and because @entity3 was not in the war , and therefore not censoring news , while the @entity20 , @entity53 , and @entity55 papers were suppressing anything which might have an effect on wartime morale or suggest vulnerability			1
and thus , as a prize of peace , @entity3 became forever connected to the most deadly pandemic of all time			1
opinion : the promise @entity8 could n't keep @entity66 is a seasonal illness			1
every year an influenza virus emerges , generally originating somewhere in @entity69 , and moves through the world , causing fever and chills , muscle pain and headache , cough and runny nose , and a certain number of deaths			2
that 's why you need to get a flu shot every fall -- it 's available now and you should make sure that you get it , and doubly sure that your children do -- because the flu virus is a particularly changeable microbe , and every year the virus is a slightly different genetic mix , and the vaccine has to be tailored to protect you			1
most years , most strains , influenza is especially deadly to the very young and the very old			1
in my pediatric clinic , we vaccinate every child starting at 6 months of age , but we take special trouble to make sure that the kids with medical problems , from asthma to congenital heart disease , get flu vaccine every year			1
the 1918 flu virus was different			2
it was deadly to young adults			1
the elderly , who are often the victims in flu season , did relatively well , perhaps because they had lived through a related strain of flu 30 years earlier , and therefore had some protective immunity			2
but people in their 20s and 30s , healthy young people , got sick in record numbers -- and many of them did not recover			2
opinion : the mighty women of @entity8 that same 1918 flu was unusually virulent , so a very high percentage of the people who got sick went on to die			1
they died because their lungs filled with fluid			2
they drowned , it was sometimes said , inside their own useless lungs			0
there are stories about how fast this influenza killed ; people got sick and died within 12 hours			1
but the @entity3 flu also looked more like a hemorrhagic fever -- that is , people died because the infection affected their ability to form blood clots and stop bleeding -- so there were people coughing up blood , or bleeding from their noses or their eyes			1
some victims ' feet turned black from internal bleeding			0
opinion : war : what is it good for ? art ! in other words , the 1918 virus behaved a little like the ebola virus , a hemorrhagic fever virus much in the news right now			2
this flu raced through classrooms and schools and theaters -- and cities			1
in @entity164 in october 1918 , every hospital bed was filled , and hundreds of people were dying every day			0
the city ran out of coffins			0
" the most terrifying aspect of the epidemic was the piling up of bodies , " @entity168 writes in his book , " @entity169			0
" " @entity174 , themselves sick , were overwhelmed			0
they had no place to put bodies			0
gravediggers either were sick or refused to bury influenza victims			0
" opinion : should nations pay the price for their leaders ' misdeeds ? all kinds of public health measures and quarantines were tried , as the epidemic raged			0
campaigns promoted face masks and targeted spitting in public with misdemeanor ordinances and fines			0
@entity195 closed its schools , theaters , pool halls , churches and bars , in a strategy called " social distancing			0
" @entity203 required businesses to stagger their hours , so that people would n't be squeezed together in rush hour commutes			0
when the @entity210 schools were closed , teachers were recruited as nurses			0
some towns attempted to keep the virus out altogether ; @entity168 tells the story of @entity215 , @entity216 , which blocked all incoming roads and warned railway passengers that if they stepped off the train onto the platform , they would be arrested			0
opinion : how @entity8 gave us ' cooties ' cities also built their public health infrastructures ; they opened emergency clinics , they strengthened reporting networks that tracked infectious diseases			1
in fact , the story of the 1918 influenza can be read -- by those who have eyes to see -- as the admittedly bloody beginning of the triumph of modern medicine , public health and scientific microbiology			0
but none of that is what saved us , not the development of a vaccine			0
we were saved because , as it does every year , the flu epidemic receded			2
maybe that intensely virulent strain of influenza virus was replaced , over time , by a less virulent strain			0
and the annual influenza story became a largely pro forma public health story : viral strain identified , vaccine manufactured , full speed ahead ! get your flu shots ! opinion : the ' bionic men ' of @entity8 in 1918 , a virus that was unusually devastating to the young and healthy came into a world which , paradoxically , had marshaled many of its young healthy citizens for military purposes			1
so the @entity8 shaped the epidemic , and the epidemic , in turn , affected the war			1
most famously , @entity13 president @entity266 came down with influenza while attending the @entity268 and had to miss days of the negotiations that ultimately resulted in the @entity270			0
every epidemic is a product of microbiology and sociology ; we look at @entity1 now and worry about an epidemic which can spread by mass air travel in an interconnected world , which circumvents some of our modern medical precautions			1
opinion : how @entity8 gave us drones but the important lessons from the 1918 epidemic are probably not specific to the virus -- or rather , they would argue for looking closely at any contagious illness and thinking carefully about true risk and true benefit			1
how is the virus actually transmitted , when does it make sense to practice social distancing , to institute quarantines , to close the schools and the pool halls and the churches ? we have microbiological knowledge that the good people of 1918 did not possess ; we have antiviral drugs and disposable personal protective equipment to be put on by everyone working with patients at risk			0
that should make us at once more fearful -- because yes , indeed , the world as we know it may end because of new and terrifying infectious agents -- and more sanguine -- because yes , we live in a world of microbes			0
they live on us , and in us , and sometimes we travel together into darkness			0
opinion : when chemical weapons killed 90,000 nothing will ever take away the threat of a new and virulent microbe			2
but we have learned a lot about building institutions to help us protect ourselves and the people we love , about public health and common sense			0
in other words , stop worrying about @entity1 , think about 1918 , wash your hands and go get that flu shot			1
photo blog : @entity8 : the @entity322 of postcards			1

@entity325 : before @entity1 , there was @entity3 flu , @entity8 - era pandemic
it killed tens of millions , more than died in war ; mainly young adults ; was similar to @entity1
one result : cities modernized medical infrastructure , strategies to stop spread , she says
@entity341 : it taught us realities of *stemming* contagion : wash hands , get your flu shot !
