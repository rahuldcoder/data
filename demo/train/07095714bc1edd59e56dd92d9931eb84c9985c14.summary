-- babies are unpredictable , messy and constantly changing			0
sleep - deprived parents struggling to make sense of their tiny humans ' behaviors are starting to take a scientific approach , collecting data in the hopes of solving problems like not sleeping through the night			2
ankle monitors are typically associated with criminals on house arrest , but the latest gadget for this generation of tech - saturated parents mimics the shackles of old -- in much friendlier colors			1
@entity20 's baby ankle monitor tracks vitals such as heart rate and body temperature , and can tell if a baby is moving or in a dangerous face - down sleeping position			1
the environmental sensor picks up on the humidity , noise levels and temperature of the baby 's room			1
best of all , it learns about each child 's behaviors over time and adjusts accordingly			0
for example , it might deduce the optimal room temperature for sleeping based on a child 's nap patterns and point out that lowering the temperature two degrees will help the baby sleep 20 minutes longer			1
or if it senses elevated noise levels , it could warn parents that their child is going to wake up unless it 's quieter			1
but are there are concerns about introducing yet another gadget into parenting			0
children are already glued to their @entity52 , parents to their smartphones			0
instead of relying on first - person observations or their own instincts , parents could use devices as a crutch			0
the promise of solving problems with enough data can also be misleading			0
for some babies , all the quantifying in the world wo n't make them sleep better			0
knowing too much about an infant 's status and vitals could put a naturally anxious parent at ease			0
or having more information could inflame worries			0
instead of sneaking in to make sure a baby is breathing , a father might spend the evening staring uneasily at an app , or compare his kid 's measurements and behaviors to other children and wonder if it 's normal			2
parents should read aloud to infants every day , pediatricians say to avoid overwhelming parents , @entity20 is n't handing over raw data about individual children			1
" that detailed information in the hands of a parent without any context will actually create fear and anxiety , " said @entity20 ceo @entity87			2
" on its own , data really is meaningless to people until they have the means to understand it			0
" while not ideal , physically attaching a device to a child is currently most efficent way to collect data			2
@entity20 's adjustable ankle bracelet is made from a soft fabric ( which is machine washable ) , and the sensor , which charges wirelessly , is medical - grade silicon			1
the white charging dish doubles as the environmental sensor , and the mobile app serves up advice and warnings			1
parents can pre-order the kit for $ 250 now and it will ship in march 2015			1
it 's not the first wearable baby monitor on the market			1
@entity117 makes a $ 200 onesie with a detachable monitor that also tracks heart rate , skin temperature , movement and sleeping positions			1
@entity124 is another baby wearable still in production that straps to the ankle and sends text alerts			2
the most popular baby names are ... @entity20 sets itself apart by returning insights instead of just data , and by looping in information about the surrounding environment like light and noise levels			1
it also uses machine learning to give tips , insight and advice based on data collected from a specific child			2
the team behind @entity20 has a lot of experience with design and integrating data with people 's everyday lives			2
the company 's early employees come from medical companies , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			0
@entity20 received $ 2.5 million in venture capital funding in 2013			1
@entity87 is confident @entity20 's baby monitor will stand out when it 's released			1
( he even tested the product on his kids )			0
the company already has four more products in the pipeline to cover older kids and the rest of the family			0
even so , he knows attaching a device to a baby is n't going to appeal to all parents			1
" it 's not for everybody			0
i think there 's a lot of parents who will never put technology on their kids			0
" @entity175 's brains are ready to bond with kids			0

the @entity20 baby monitor tracks heart rate , position and body temperature using an ankle bracelet
parents get insights and tips into their child through a mobile app
the $ 250 device will be available in 2015
