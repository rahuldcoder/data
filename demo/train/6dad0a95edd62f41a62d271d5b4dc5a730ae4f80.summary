-- the optics , as they say , were good			0
@entity4 secretary of state @entity3 and his @entity6 counterpart @entity5 smiled and joked at the @entity8 news conference that wrapped up three days of talks on how to dismantle @entity11 's chemical weapons arsenal			1
by their own acknowledgment , the framework agreed upon is very ambitious			2
it will involve ramping up the work of a little - known outfit called the @entity18 , an organization so little known that @entity3 and @entity5 both called it the @entity19 for the @entity20			0
the two sides agreed that to keep up the momentum of the process , the normal timetable for the organization 's work must be jettisoned			0
the framework notes that " the @entity4 and the @entity6 believe that these extraordinary procedures are necessitated by the prior use of these weapons in @entity11 , " carefully not assigning blame for their use			1
@entity4 , @entity6 agree to framework on @entity11 chemical weapons so expedited is this process that the @entity11 government is expected to provide a full list of its chemical weapons stocks within one week , including their " location and form of storage , production , and research and development facilities			1
" further , " the elimination process must include the facilities for the development and production of these weapons , " according to the agreement			0
the @entity52 regime may argue that parts of some facilities ( such as the @entity55 in @entity56 ) have other purposes and would therefore be off - limits to inspectors			0
that was a regular source of friction between @entity63 's government in @entity64 and the @entity66 inspectors deployed to flush out its weapons of mass destruction			2
read the framework of the agreement one critical part of the deal is that the two sides say they now have a " shared assessment of the amount and type of chemical weapons involved , " even though @entity4 officials have in recent days given conflicting views on just how much @entity11 may have and where it may be			1
for the past few months both @entity81 and @entity4 sources have indicated that the @entity52 regime has been dispersing its chemical weapons stocks			1
but @entity3 implied that the regime may have moved its chemical weapons into safer ( and therefore more accessible ) sites			1
the two sides also agreed that a @entity86 resolution will be drafted to give international blessing to the @entity18 's mission			0
@entity3 said : " we have committed to impose measures under @entity91 in the @entity86			0
" but no one expects any specific mention in that resolution of the possibility of military action			0
that option -- at least in a multilateral setting -- is a can being kicked down the road			0
@entity6 and the @entity4 have agreed that " in the event of noncompliance , including unauthorized transfer , or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in @entity11 , the @entity86 should impose measures under @entity107 of the @entity108			1
" " measures " can take the form of sanctions as well as military action			0
the @entity113 has used the formula " consequences for noncompliance , " and at the news conference @entity3 said the response of the international community would have to be commensurate with any violation			0
down the track , there may well be heated debate about what is " commensurate			0
" @entity3 stressed that president @entity125 still had the right as commander - in - chief to take unilateral action to protect @entity4 interests , but said he would not be drawn on what the remedy " might be for circumstances we do n't even know yet			2
" keep up with the latest developments in @entity11 the agreement insists on " the immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites in @entity11 , " but there are a multitude of ways to obstruct this			2
what if the regime drew rebel groups into a battle for a critical road artery that then became unusable to the @entity18 teams ? and who would protect the inspectors ? the agreement notes the " primary responsibility of the @entity11 government in this regard			1
" other logistical headaches : what sort of transport would be required to move the arsenal out of @entity11 ? given the regional neighborhood and the fact that the regime is not in control of many border crossings , shipping the agents and equipment out by air may be the preferred option			1
interestingly , the agreement specified the possibility " of consolidation and destruction in the coastal area of @entity11 , " an area largely controlled by the government			2
the greatest obstacle to the process agreed to in @entity8 is events on the ground			0
@entity18 inspectors are expected to complete their initial assessment , as well as the destruction of production equipment and mixing and filling equipment , by the end of november			1
the @entity3 - @entity5 agreement aims for " removal of the largest amounts of weapons feasible , under @entity18 supervision , and their destruction outside of @entity11 , if possible			1
" the chaotic battle - lines across @entity11 , and the need for inspectors to visit and secure perhaps as many as 50 sites across the country , may make that task formidable			1
still to be established : who would protect convoys carrying these chemical agents to a central location ? would rebel groups ( hardly a coherent force ) agree to a ceasefire where chemical weapons are being collected and moved ? the rebels ' military command has already rejected the idea of a truce			1
the @entity86 inspectors in @entity64 spent seven years trying to uncover and destroy its weapons of mass destruction program			1
there were hundreds of inspectors and technicians on the ground , part of an organization that had backroom staff , the support of the @entity86 and a substantial budget			0
while @entity63 's wmd arsenal was probably much greater than is @entity11 's , the @entity66 inspectors were not working in the middle of a civil war			2
so the @entity6 - @entity4 accord is perhaps understating the magnitude of the task at hand when it talks of " ambitious goals for the removal and destruction of all categories of chemical weapons - related materials and equipment with the objective of completing such removal and destruction in the first half of 2014			1
" the glaring " asterisk " in the framework agreement is close to the end where both sides " note that there are details in furtherance of the execution of this framework that need to be addressed on an expedited basis in the coming days			2
" but the @entity252 agreement and its annexes represent a remarkable and rapid advance in @entity4 - @entity6 cooperation on @entity11			1
both @entity3 and @entity5 stressed their constant contact on this and many other issues , with the @entity6 foreign minister pointing out that the agreement showed the @entity4 and @entity6 could get results			1
if public appearances are any guide , they have a relaxed and collegial relationship			0
and both dared to suggest that this agreement might open the window toward an even more ambitious goal , creating the conditions for political negotiations between the @entity11 government and opposition			2
@entity3 reiterated in his opening remarks that the @entity11 conflict would only be solved by political negotiation			0
both he and @entity5 spent time with @entity86 envoy @entity278 while in @entity8 , the man charged with the hitherto impossible task of bringing the @entity11 government and rebels together			0
@entity283 responds to @entity285 's op - ed , with his own			0

@entity4 , @entity6 agrees the framework is ambitious
@entity11 expected to provide a full list of its chemical weapons stocks in one week
method that will be used to transport chemical weapons is an issue
inspectors are to assess and destroy weapons by the end of november
