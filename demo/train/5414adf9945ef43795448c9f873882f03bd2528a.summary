@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 woman who stormed into a @entity0 hotel saturday , telling foreign reporters that she had been raped by government troops , has been released , and her case is being investigated , government spokesman @entity3 said sunday			1
the matter is " a criminal case against four individuals " who have an attorney , he said			1

the woman " has n't committed , you know , any particular major offense , " @entity3 said			1

" he said @entity24 and her family have been asked if they want to be interviewed by " one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family			1
" but @entity3 refused to take further questions on the issue sunday , noting that @entity1 society is " very conservative			1
" @entity2 's @entity33 , who has been on the ground in @entity0 since february 27 , cautioned against taking @entity3 's statements as fact , noting that " oftentimes what he says does n't match reality			1

@entity33 also tried to ask @entity3 about statements the spokesman made referring to @entity24 as a prostitute , but he declined to answer the question while saying , " i 'm not withdrawing from what i said			1
" " we need to protect her privacy , her daughter 's rights when she grows up , " @entity3 said			1
" we need to make this as criminal case , as legal a case as possible without talking about people 's history , their files , their previous crimes or their lifestyle			1
" @entity80 , the woman 's cousin , told @entity2 that the 30 - year - old @entity24 is single and does not have a daughter			2
