@entity0 , @entity1 -- house speaker @entity3 is trashing president @entity5 's foreign policy on the campaign trail by talking up someone @entity7 have spent years running from : @entity9			1
" does anybody think that @entity11 would have gone into @entity12 had @entity9 been president of the @entity13 ? no ! " @entity3 asked , and answered , before a group of @entity7 volunteers here			1
" even @entity11 is smart enough to know that @entity9 would have punched him in the nose in about 10 seconds ! " @entity3 said to an applauding crowd			2
@entity3 often uses colorful language to slam the president for his leadership , especially on national security			0
but to invoke @entity9 is unusual , especially since his foreign policy decisions -- namely the @entity24 war -- led to a clean @entity26 sweep in 2006			0
@entity26 took control of both the @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity9 's sixth year in office			1
@entity3 is also engaging in revisionist history of sorts , since @entity11 did in fact invade another former member of the @entity35 and key @entity13 ally , the @entity37 , in 2008 when @entity9 was president			1
@entity9 did not punch either @entity11 or then - @entity40 prime minister @entity39 in the nose			0
in fact , @entity9 was criticized at the time by some for not reacting more forcefully against @entity40			2
as for @entity3 -- he reacted in a bipartisan way back then -- releasing a joint statement with then - house speaker @entity47 and other leaders in both parties " condemning -- in the strongest possible terms -- the recent invasion of the sovereign state of georgia			0

@entity3 criticizes president @entity5 's response to @entity40 *takeover* of @entity12
he says it would *n't* have *happened* when @entity9 was president
@entity9 's response was criticized when @entity40 invaded @entity37 in 2008
