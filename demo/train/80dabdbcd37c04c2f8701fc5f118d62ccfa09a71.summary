@entity0 -- when @entity3 minority leader @entity2 announced that she would seek to keep her leadership role she stood flanked by a cheering phalanx of her female colleagues			1
@entity2 , who prior to the @entity8 's loss of the @entity3 in 2010 served as its first female speaker , sandwiched her announcement between pointed comments about the @entity8 agenda and how she sees her party 's policies as helpful to women			1
@entity2 said she would vie to keep her leadership role " in order to continue work on empowering women			2
" but as even @entity8 exult an election which saw , for the first time in history , women and minorities net the majority of @entity3 seats on their side of the aisle and a record 16 @entity8 seats in the @entity30 , political experts warn against premature celebration			1
@entity2 to run again for @entity8 leader an increase in the number of women does not automatically translate into increased political power			1
@entity8 may have been able to woo female voters and throw tremendous support behind getting women elected to office , but that " does n't mean that is how they govern , " said @entity43 , director of the @entity44 at @entity45			0
" moving forward in the direction that will improve women 's social , economic and political autonomy takes time , " she said -- time and the type of power that @entity3 @entity8 currently lack			1
new @entity53 house : women and minorities to the left ; white men to the right @entity8 are the minority in the @entity3 and do not have control of that chamber 's most powerful committees			1
that means they have far less control over the types of legislation that comes out of those committees			2
and even within the @entity8 @entity3 caucus , women are far outnumbered and outranked on some of the most powerful committees			1
" the most traditional measure ( of political power ) would be leadership positions , not just ranking positions on key committees but any membership on these committees , " @entity43 said			1
there is only one @entity8 woman , rep. @entity80 of @entity81 , on the powerful @entity82 , which oversees tax writing , revenue and entitlement programs			0
there are other male lawmakers ahead of her with seniority to serve as ranking member			0
the ranking @entity8 on the @entity94 , @entity90 , @entity91 and the @entity93 committees are also all men			0
@entity97 rep. @entity96 , one of the longest - serving women in @entity99 , is the ranking member on the @entity100			0
while the @entity30 has a greater share of women in leadership positions , there are no @entity106 women in top leadership roles			1
there are also other questions of whether women indeed have an equal place at the political table , @entity43 said			2
@entity43 added that there are questions , like who is sponsoring significant pieces of legislation ? who are the most outspoken members regarding women 's issues ? are women leading the discussions on the fiscal cliff ? with their big political win , the new @entity53 electorate has arrived those questions will perhaps best be answered when the new @entity99 convenes in january			1
however , with such dramatic demographic and ideological differences in the @entity3 â € ” women and minorities make up the majority on the left , white men are the majority on the right â € ” @entity99 is likely headed for more partisan gridlock , said @entity136 , @entity3 editor for the @entity137			2
for example , " it will be more difficult to pass a bill to address the debt , " he said			0
the two parties and their newly remade majorities also will likely be at loggerheads on such issues as entitlement spending , immigration and health care reform , political experts say			1
in the upcoming policy debates , the @entity106 side of the aisle will find it tougher to utilize their dwindled female corps to reach out to their @entity8 compatriots , political experts say			1
" for @entity106 women it was a bad night , " @entity157 , a @entity158 professor of @entity53 government , said of @entity160			0
in the @entity3 , a number of @entity106 women lost races including @entity164 , @entity165 , mayor @entity166 , a @entity167 of @entity169 descent and rising @entity106 star who was given a high - profile speaking role at the @entity173 in august			2
others , such as tea party favorite and former presidential candidate rep. @entity178 , @entity174 narrowly kept their seats			0
the majority of the @entity106 - held @entity3 seats are occupied by white men			0
rep. @entity182 of @entity0 , the @entity106 's top woman in the @entity3 , was elected @entity183 on wednesday , despite the fact that @entity186 rep. @entity185 , @entity187 's running mate , threw his support behind rep. @entity189 of @entity190			0
" they 're somewhat limited , " @entity43 said of the @entity106 leadership 's ability to put forth women on key issues			2
" only 10 % of the @entity99 is women			0
to the extent they want to be inclusive , it 's not as if there 's dozens and dozens of women who can speak for them			0
the lack of numbers hurts			0

*democrats* cheer gains of women , but experts say power is not yet among them
there are few women in either party who hold key roles on powerful @entity3 committees
true test will be increase in leadership roles , sponsoring legislation , political experts say
