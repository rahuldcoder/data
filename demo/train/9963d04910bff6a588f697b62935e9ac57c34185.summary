-- " i hate my dreams			0
they 're so ... infantile			0
" @entity4 knows what artist @entity5 would make of @entity7 's first film since " @entity8 , " but if audiences do n't go for it , we 're more likely to hear a different complaint : it 's just too darned complex			1
a spectacular fantasy thriller based on @entity7 's own original screenplay , " @entity17 " is the smartest cgi head - trip since " @entity19			1
" the premise is so out - there , it requires not just a leap of faith but also too much screen time to explain , so do yourself a favor and pay attention			0
@entity27 is @entity28 , an " excavator , " who digs around in people 's subconscious while they 're catching some zzzzs			1
this act of infiltration is " not strictly legal " ; the motive is not therapeutic but espionage and theft			0
it 's also not a solo operation			2
to do the job properly requires an " architect , " basically someone to design an appropriate dreamscape , something vivid and detailed enough to keep the dreamer 's defenses down			2
depending on the complexity of the project , it might also require a " burglar , " a " chemist " and preferably someone on the outside to administer a well - timed wake up call			0
@entity28 's partners include @entity57 ( @entity58 ) ; a newbie , @entity60 ( @entity61 ) ; @entity62 ( @entity63 ) ; and @entity64 ( @entity65 )			2
their client , @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , wants more than access to a rival industrialist 's grey matter ; he requires @entity28 to plant an idea in there that will dismantle an entire conglomerate			2
as if that were n't hard enough , @entity28 is also plagued with keeping his own demons at bay , in the form of an angry dead wife ( @entity80 )			0
@entity27 evidently has n't got " @entity82 " out of his system yet			1
a kind of meta - heist movie , " @entity17 " evokes @entity86 's cerebral sci - fi , the exploration of alternate states of consciousness , memory and fantasy			1
but these are also @entity7 's themes , familiar from the amnesiac noir of " @entity94 " and the many , varied mind - games practiced by the warring magicians in " @entity97 " as well as the psychological warfare between @entity99 and his adversaries ( fans of that series will recognize several familiar faces popping up here )			1
" an idea is like a virus , " says @entity28 , and that idea too might have been born in @entity108 or in the rabid enthusiasm that greeted " @entity8			0
" like " @entity94 " and " @entity97 , " " @entity17 " is constructed as a box of tricks			1
@entity60 ( who helped @entity113 slay the minotaur in @entity116 mythology ) devises labyrinths that are also escape hatches , and that metaphor of the maze runs through " @entity17 , " which is itself a puzzle to be navigated by filmmaker and audience alike			1
in the course of probing his subject 's subconscious , @entity28 escorts him into a dream - within - a - dream - within - a - dream			1
if it 's a little disappointing that each level plays out as a straight - up action thriller ( this guy really should get out more ) , the rules of this game are delightfully devious			2
@entity135 : share your review of " @entity17 " he has a tendency to over-complicate , but nobody bends time more ingeniously than @entity7			1
three minutes in one dream might correspond to an hour in the next , and both transpire in a matter of seconds up in the real world			2
gloriously , real world physics are refracted in the dream zones -- gravity just drops out like a faulty signal -- and if the dreamer starts to stir , the universe crumbles			0
( @entity152 : the ultimate @entity154 nightmare			0
) it certainly has n't escaped @entity7 's attention that this dream life functions as a metaphor for the movies			1
ariadne is a production designer , @entity28 an actor - director			0
extras in the dream -- ordinary passers - by -- are known as " projections , " and they become hostile if they suspect that someone is messing with their reality			0
" inception " only dabbles in the art of perception			0
for all its layering , the movie 's depth remains on the surface			0
but with its grand , clanging @entity178 score , its immense , dazzling effects and audacious storytelling , it 's the summer 's best bet to bust the blocks .			1

" @entity17 " is a spectacular fantasy thriller based on director @entity7 's screenplay
@entity27 digs around in people 's subconscious while they dream
" @entity17 " is the summer 's best bet to bust the blocks
