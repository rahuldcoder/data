@entity0 -- @entity5 's move to abolish re-education through labor camps -- under which tens of thousands have been imprisoned without trial -- may be no more than a cosmetic change , a new report from @entity3 warns			1
the human rights group says that while labor camps are being shut , research suggested that authorities are expanding the use of " black jails , " enforced drug rehabilitation clinics and " brainwashing centers " to take their place			2
" there is a very real risk that the @entity5 authorities will abolish one system of arbitrary detention only to expand the use of other types , " the report said			1
a spokesman from @entity5 's @entity29 declined to comment on the @entity3 report			1
@entity31 , @entity3 's @entity5 researcher , said the abolishment may only be a " cosmetic change just to avert the public outcry over the abusive re-education through labor system			1
" @entity5 said on november 15 that it would close its labor camps after earlier putting the policy under review , with the move hailed as the biggest change to @entity5 's criminal justice system in decades			1
detention without trial the system was set up in 1950s and allows police to detain petty offenders -- such as thieves , prostitutes and drug addicts -- for up to four years without a trial			2
according to @entity5 's @entity29 , the country had 351 labor camps at the end of 2012 , with more than 50,000 inmates			1
other estimates have put the number of detainees much higher			0
the " re-education process " has also been used to punish those detained for their political , religious or personal beliefs -- such as members of the banned @entity64 spiritual movement or petitioners with complaints against local officials , @entity3 said			0
torture is said to be rife at the camps			0
detainees have told @entity3 they were beaten , sometimes with electric batons , denied food , subjected to simulated drowning , injected with unknown drugs and subjected to the " rack " torture			0
" brainwashing centers the report said interviews with petitioners and @entity64 practitioners revealed abuses were continuing despite the closure of the camps			0
some labor camps were being re-labeled as drug rehabilitation centers and released detainees were being sent to black jails -- unofficial detention centers set up in places like hotels or abandoned buildings -- or " brainwashing centers , " another form of arbitrary detention			2
@entity64 practitioner @entity97 told @entity3 she was released from a labor camp in @entity99 in june 2013 but on her release staff from a brainwashing center were waiting for her at the gate			2
her family were able to intervene and prevented her from being taken away			0
she has since gone into hiding			0
" the @entity5 authorities must immediately end all forms of arbitrary detention and ensure that laws protecting detainees are brought into line with international human rights standards , " @entity105 said			1
" this needs to be a fundamental change in the policies that are at the root of the repression and which strip detainees of their most basic rights			0
