-- @entity1 has a schedule that rivals none			2
in the morning she has an interview with a journalist who seems to have a vendetta against her to be followed by her son 's engagement dinner , where she 'll meet her ex-husband 's buxom girlfriend			2
oh , and she has to handle a diplomatic crisis involving three innocent @entity13 journalists who are about to be executed by a foreign dictator			2
all in a day 's work for the secretary of state in the fictional world of @entity19 's " political animals			1
" the six - hour miniseries , which will premiere at 10 p.m. et on sunday , stars @entity20 as @entity1 , a former first lady who becomes the secretary of state after losing the presidential nomination			1
with " political animals , " viewers will get watch as @entity20 's character deals with her challenging political role and tumultuous family life			1
fans may recall that @entity20 once played the first lady in " @entity31 , " a 1993 romantic comedy about a presidential switcheroo			1
however , her new role as @entity1 places the actress in a more powerful leading role			1
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity20 said her new character is a no - nonsense , powerful politician who is also the head of the household			1
why summer is becoming the prime time for prime - time tv " it 's one of the richest roles i 've ever played , " she said			2
" she is kind , such a passionate politician for the right reason and her moral compass is so strong			2
she is sure - footed			2
" the @entity52 family and their collective storylines are also central to the series			1
" @entity25 " creator , executive producer and writer @entity56 said that while the show has a political theme , viewers will see more scenes featuring the @entity63 sitting around more dining tables than conference tables			1
" i was intrigued by writing about a former first family , " @entity56 said			1
" there 's this wistful quality of ' were n't we great when ... ' " @entity56 , who was also one of the creative forces behind the tv series " @entity77 , " said that the human side of those in politics is often forgotten by the general public and he wanted to capture that in this project			1
on @entity78 , art imitating political life ? " one of the things about the show is the duality about our public life , about our noble goals , dedicating our life to something , " he said			1
" but it comes as a sacrifice			0
there are things that are engaging to them			0
there are darker elements to each of their characters			0
the flawed characters are indeed aplenty in " political animals			1
" @entity1 's youngest son @entity52 ( @entity101 , " @entity102 " ) is the first openly gay son of an @entity13 president and is secretly a drug addict			0
@entity105 ( @entity106 , " @entity107 " ) is the charismatic ex-husband of @entity1 whose popularity sinks after his affairs are revealed			0
the miniseries as with other political dramas like " @entity112 , " draws some parallels to the present			1
@entity1 as the secretary of state in some ways embodies the years of the only three women to occupy the position ; @entity119 , @entity120 and currently @entity121			1
and @entity123 's unfaithfulness and @entity1 's run for president before becoming the secretary of state might remind viewers of events surrounding a certain real - life political family			1
@entity56 said the @entity130 certainly seem to mirror the @entity131 , however @entity1 's character has other influences			0
" i do n't want to be coy of @entity121 and @entity135 comparisons			0
" their resume is sort of the same and i liked the dynamic of a power couple			0
but it comes more from @entity119 's book			0
we were trying to draw ( on ) what it means to be the first female secretary of state			1
" @entity56 said that he was also interested in presenting how different personalities clash in politics , even when they are playing for the same team			2
" politically speaking , it 's not us versus them , or @entity153 versus @entity154			0
" it 's @entity153 versus @entity153			0
" for example , there is @entity1 's relationship with president @entity159 ( @entity160 , " heroes " ) who went from being her opponent in the presidential race to her boss			0
they clash over foreign policy among other things			0
" they pick the best rowers , they all realize that they are the on the same boat , " @entity160 said			0
" they had to do what they did to get to the @entity175			0
they realize that politically they enhance each other 's political power , but personally they diminish it			2
there is a respect , begrudgingly , that is fun to play with			0
" a similar tension exists initially between @entity1 and @entity185 ( @entity186 , " @entity187 " ) , the @entity189 - winning journalist who has made her career by following and criticizing the @entity130			0
@entity186 said her character of @entity185 grew up idealizing @entity1 but was disappointed when @entity1 stayed with the philandering @entity123 for as long as she did			0
summertime is a hot time for @entity19 " they are more birds of the feather , " @entity186 said			1
" what their professions are also keeps them at a certain distance			0
there is something that is connecting them			0
" @entity186 said that @entity185 becomes closer to the family in the process of an exclusive interview and the two women slowly form an unspoken alliance in a political world dominated by men			1
@entity20 said that the idea of a woman taking the political helm attracted her to " @entity25 " in the first place and she said that the format of the series will give the concept some substance			1
" i hope it will encourage more women in politics , " she said			1
" we need more women in politics			1
we do n't stand on ceremony and are not about hierarchy			0
we are much more practical because we are mothers			0
... i am hoping the show will reach women			2
women are needed in @entity231			2
