-- there 's a reason @entity3 conceived the @entity4 as a team : the menagerie of mutants are more interesting when they come in a pack			0
when the posse of super-powered outcasts was first brought to the screen by @entity15 in 2000 , @entity11 's mutton - chopped , adamantium - clawed @entity10 emerged as the stand - out super-freak			1
and @entity18 accounting being what it is , he was naturally granted his own solo encore in 2009 's underwhelming x-men origins : @entity10 , a silly spin - off that never quite came together			1
now , to wipe the slate clean , @entity11 and director @entity24 ( @entity25 ; girl , interrupted ) have teamed up to bring out the claws once again in the @entity10			1
and while it 's definitely a more entertaining and far deeper film than the last @entity10 outing , it still falls short of the top tier of @entity3 tentpoles like the fizzy @entity33 and @entity35 's @entity34			1
based on @entity36 and @entity38 's much - loved 1982 comic - book arc , the @entity10 is an existential ( and at times soddenly heavy ) story about our razor - taloned hero grappling with the burden of immortality and loss			1
but before we wade into that therapy session , the film opens with a harrowing sequence set , like most of the film , in @entity49			1
it 's @entity51 , and @entity11 's @entity10 is imprisoned in a @entity49 pow camp in @entity53 as b - 29s fly overhead to deliver the atomic bomb			1
during the blast he saves one of his captors , a soldier named @entity59 , who , during the explosion , learns of @entity10 's invincibility and ability to heal his own wounds			1
decades later , @entity10 , who has n't aged a day , has renounced violence and lives as a hirsute hermit in the @entity67			2
there , he 's tracked down by a punky , red - haired @entity49 pixie named @entity70 ( @entity71 ) , who informs him that the man he saved back in the prison camp is now a rich industrialist on his deathbed			1
he 's requesting @entity10 's presence to thank him and settle the karmic debt that he believes he owes him			1
of course , that 's not all he wants			0
@entity10 heads to @entity49 to pay his respects and discovers not only that the aging @entity59 ( @entity81 ) wants to steal the secret to @entity10 's immortality , but also that he has a granddaughter , @entity85 ( @entity84 ) , who 's about to inherit his fortune and is in need of @entity10 's unique brand of badass protection			1
why @entity10 complies is never really explained			2
regardless , @entity10 and @entity85 are on the run from a lethal posse of tattooed @entity92 and some other samurai - style baddies straight out of the @entity96 playbook , including @entity59 's femme fatale blonde nurse ( @entity97 ) who possesses certain viper - y gifts of her own			1
as @entity10 and his charge hit the road , sparks fly , ninjas attack , and @entity10 begins to experience something he never has before â € ” the actual fear of death			2
he 's been sapped of his eternal life force and now , when he gets into one of his signature slice - and - dice brawls , the wounds he suffers no longer cauterize and heal			2
he 's both physically and emotionally vulnerable			0
in other words , human			0
all of this makes for a @entity10 tale that 's more loaded with psychological questions ( his immortality is seen as a curse ) and makes the haunted character more interesting			2
still , that 's no excuse for the film 's gauzy dream sequences with @entity122 's @entity121 and its overall bloat , which leads up to a preposterous ( and endless ) final half hour			0
over the past decade , the @entity3 brand has become a virtual guarantee of box - office bang			0
but someone over at the company 's @entity128 really needs to look into tightening up these films			0
they just do n't know when to end			0
that said , it 's worth pointing out two things that the @entity10 gets right ( aside from @entity11 's always excellent , strong - and - silent - type performance as @entity10 )			1
the first is an action sequence that occurs mid-way in the film , when @entity10 is being pursued on top of a bullet train			2
by now , we 've all seen so many beat - downs atop locomotives that they 've become numbingly similar			0
but the one in the @entity10 is so frantic and adrenalized ( not to mention the only part of the film that takes advantage of @entity147 ) that the familiar becomes new again			2
the film also sticks the landing on a brief teaser scene after the end credits that hints at future developments in the @entity4 universe			0
i wo n't spoil the pleasure of what happens			0
but you have to hand it to @entity3 for managing to leave audiences breathless in anticipation of a sequel after making them sit through two - plus hours of merely satisfactory storytelling			0
