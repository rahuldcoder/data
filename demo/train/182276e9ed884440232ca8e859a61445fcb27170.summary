-- in recent days , president @entity1 has applauded efforts to bring former @entity4 gen. @entity3 and @entity6 leader @entity5 before international courts			0
it 's another indication his administration is more willing than its predecessors to promote the role of international justice in prosecuting those accused of gross human rights abuses			0
but do n't expect the @entity15 to sign up to the @entity16 anytime soon			1
the @entity16 prosecutes individuals accused of crimes against humanity , war crimes , crimes of aggression and genocide			1
it was set up at an international conference in 1998 and came into being in 2002			1
since then , 115 states have ratified the treaty -- though the @entity15 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 are not among them			1
its very existence has long been a combustible issue in the @entity15			2
president @entity34 signed the treaty establishing the @entity16 on january 3 , 2000 -- the last day it was open for signature			1
but at the same time he said he would " not recommend that my successor submit the treaty to the @entity39 " -- saying " the @entity15 should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction			1
" conservatives have long loathed the @entity16			2
sen. @entity47 fulminated against it as " an unprecedented assault on @entity15 sovereignty			2
" president @entity51 " unsigned " the treaty , concerned that @entity15 troops and policy - makers alike could face action from a politically - motivated prosecutor			1
as then - @entity68 spokesman @entity67 put it , " the president ( @entity51 ) thinks the @entity16 is fundamentally flawed because it puts @entity15 servicemen and women at fundamental risk of being tried by an entity that is beyond @entity15 's reach , beyond @entity15 's laws and can subject @entity15 civilians and military to arbitrary standards of justice			1
" however , the @entity51 administration did accept the role of the @entity16 to bring to justice the perpetrators of what it described as genocide in @entity75 , @entity76			1
in 2005 , the @entity15 abstained rather than veto a @entity78 resolution referring allegations of war crimes in @entity75 to the @entity16			1
within the current administration , secretary of state @entity81 appears the most enthusiastic about joining the @entity16			2
two years ago , at an event in @entity85 , @entity0 's @entity83 asked @entity34 whether it was more difficult to pursue human rights issues so long as the @entity15 was not a signatory			2
" that is a great regret , but it is a fact that we are not yet a signatory , " she said			0
" but we have supported the work of the court and will continue to do so under the @entity1 administration			0
" on thursday @entity34 was effusive about the capture of @entity3			0
" @entity3 's arrest serves as a statement to those around the world who would break the law and target innocent civilians : international justice works , " she said pointedly			0
@entity3 will actually be prosecuted by the @entity105 for the @entity106 , but the sentiment is clear and @entity1 echoed her view			0
" from @entity111 to the present , the @entity15 has long viewed justice for war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide as both a moral imperative and an essential element of stability and peace , " he said in a statement issued at the @entity110			1
while not expending political capital at home on a battle to ratify the @entity125 that established the court , @entity1 backed the @entity16 's decision in 2009 to issue an arrest warrant for @entity76 president @entity129 in connection with the killings in @entity75			2
the @entity1 administration also supports the involvement of the @entity16 in @entity6			2
in february , the @entity15 voted for @entity134 1970 that referred the situation in @entity6 to the @entity16 , stating that " widespread and systematic attacks currently taking place against the civilian population may amount to crimes against humanity			1
" the @entity16 's chief prosecutor has since issued arrest warrants for @entity5 , his son @entity143 and @entity6 intelligence chief @entity144			0
those who want the @entity15 to lend its full weight to the court say fears that @entity15 officials and soldiers would find themselves in the dock are overdone			0
the @entity16 is designed as a court of last resort , to take action when the host country is unable or unwilling to prosecute individuals accused of grave crimes			1
they also argue that the @entity51 administration 's refusal to sign up reinforced perceptions overseas that it was " unilateralist			0
" in a column for the @entity168 this week , lt. col. @entity164 , a serving @entity165 and senior fellow at the @entity166 , recalled a conversation he had on a recent training trip to @entity171 : " one @entity171 officer asked me , ' if the @entity15 believes in accountability over impunity , why are you not a party to the @entity16 ? ' i did not have a satisfactory answer			1
" but @entity171 and most other @entity178 states have also turned their back on the court -- for one reason : @entity29			2
@entity184 's attorney general , @entity183 , said this week : " between the @entity178 world and the court there is a big problem of misunderstanding , " saying the court was selective in its investigations			0
some @entity191 commentators point to the fact that the great majority of arrest warrants issued so far have been for @entity191			0
after the arrest warrant was issued for @entity76 leader @entity129 , a @entity76 official dismissed the court as " one of the tools of the new colonization			0
" so despite modest progress ( though as yet no convictions ) the @entity16 is far from establishing itself as a universally respected institution			0
justice -- like beauty -- is in the eye of the beholder .			0
