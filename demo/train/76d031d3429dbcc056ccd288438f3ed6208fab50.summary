what if the rev. @entity2 's spirit could appear and whisper his counsel to president @entity5 ? the visit 's timing could not be more opportune			1
today , we face the country 's worst economic crisis since the @entity12 , poverty continues to grow at home and abroad , and wars across the globe are leaving a wake of death and destruction for generations to come			0
notwithstanding @entity21 's racial progress -- most viscerally witnessed by @entity5 himself -- @entity2 's dream remains far from realized			1
@entity2 spoke some of the most mellifluous speeches of his era			2
but @entity2 could advise @entity5 on transforming that uplifting rhetoric into a long - term grassroots effort			1
beyond @entity2 's great speeches was a decades - long movement that was complex , sophisticated , forward - looking and greater than the man himself			1
when we forget @entity2 's coalition -- both in the breadth of change it demanded and in the thousands of faces and hearts dedicated to the cause -- we reduce the civil rights movement , from which we still have much to learn , into a warm and fuzzy version of the @entity2 mythology			1
@entity2 's spirit , no doubt , would advise @entity5 to press for the public option in the health care bill			1
" of all the forms of inequality , injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane , " @entity2 declared in 1966			0
the public option sharply reduces injustices in health care by offering millions of the beleaguered and the downtrodden a more transparent , accountable and affordable coverage option than the abusive , helter - skelter and often monopolistic practices rampant in the private market			0
two years after @entity2 's remarks , the year he was assassinated , he launched his @entity60 , " a multiracial army of the poor , " that marched on @entity61 to demand an @entity62 from @entity63			2
@entity2 's @entity62 called for effective government jobs programs to rebuild @entity21 's cities			1
he saw a crying need to confront a @entity63 that had demonstrated its " hostility to the poor , " appropriating " military funds with alacrity and generosity " but providing " poverty funds with miserliness			0
" his vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform : a " reconstruction of society itself " to redress the deep - rooted problems of racism , poverty and military conflict			1
this is the moment to realize that vision			0
@entity21 are at a crucial juncture when we are fundamentally redefining our country 's future at home and abroad			0
@entity2 would counsel @entity5 on how to minimize economic inequality , to boost the employment prospects of those living in marginalized communities , to increase citizens ' savings , to encourage asset building and even to resolve peacefully our two wars			2
the enormity and uncertainty haunting this recession raises important questions that @entity2 's spirit could address			1
what is the impact on unemployed and low - income @entity21 ? will the fear of projected budget deficits force government spending choices that worsen poverty or that are racially loaded , in their stinginess toward cities ? like @entity2 , @entity5 recognizes that government is n't the principal solution to unemployment and poverty , but rather a buffer from hardship and a catalyst for opportunity			1
here , the spirit and his pupil would evidently agree			0
but they could further discuss what role private business must play to help rectify this mess			0
the failures of @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 -- in addition to the @entity137 bailout -- illustrate the devastation that a culture of greed , corruption and governmental negligence can exact on ordinary @entity21			0
what specific incentives and penalties can force the private sector to act more responsibly ? unchecked free market capitalism , @entity2 maintained , can not guarantee the basic conditions necessary for ordinary people to earn a living , to acquire health care or to build wealth			0
although private industry has a forceful influence on the underpinnings of @entity21 life , that power should not dictate our political and economic well - being			0
in other words , @entity2 to @entity5 : @entity160 should lead capital , not vice versa			2
this week , @entity21 gets to pat itself on the back for living on the right side of history , racially speaking			0
@entity5 's presidency is a glorious manifestation of @entity2 's spirit			1
we are not in a post-racial era , but @entity5 's cool judgment smoothly blunts the pessimism and ill will -- from those on the left and right -- who thrive on racial conflict			2
to his credit , our brilliant , cunning president truly understands that multiracial @entity21 needs more unflinching self - examination and less empty racial bickering			2
this week 's special school lesson plans , newscasts and public ceremonies honoring the slain civil rights hero , and the 44th president 's first anniversary in office , will be full of praise and rhetoric			0
but if only the ghost of @entity2 could glide into the @entity191 and urge @entity5 to take decisive , bold action , and to dodge the status quo behavior favored by power brokers in @entity61 and on @entity137			1
if only the ghost of @entity2 could coax @entity5 to join the ranks of historically transformative leaders , including @entity198 , who galvanized movements , who put pressure on themselves , @entity63 and the public to improve our politics and economy profoundly for decades to come			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			0
