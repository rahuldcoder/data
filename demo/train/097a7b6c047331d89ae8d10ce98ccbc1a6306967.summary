call him @entity1 that 's what most people did			1
it was " @entity1 , " not " @entity6 , " and certainly not " @entity7			1
" ( he used the @entity8 because there was already an actor named @entity1 , and union rules prevent two actors from using the same exact name			1
) he did n't stand on ceremony			1
at the @entity15 , where he was an artistic director ( and where his longtime partner , @entity16 , has the same post ) , he involved himself in fundraising , directing , acting -- whatever it took			1
" i 've seen him tear tickets and seat people at @entity25 productions , " playwright @entity20 told the @entity21			1
@entity20 , also involved in @entity25 , wrote the play " doubt , " which featured @entity1 in one of the lead roles			1
sources : @entity1 dead of apparent drug overdose in @entity31 , where he was filming the final two " @entity35 " movies , a local remembered an easygoing , gracious man			1
" he was really soft spoken and kind , " real estate agent @entity36 told the @entity37			1
" i had this idea that he would be really intense , maybe , but no. i could n't see any turmoil in his eyes			1
i felt like everything was right on with him			1
" he liked to work			1
when he was n't starring in a movie , he was taking a small part			1
when he was n't making films , he was in theater			2
if he was n't performing , he would have been a teacher , he told " @entity50 " in 2000			1
he had memories of times when he was n't acting -- or working -- at all			2
" being unemployed is not good for any actor , no matter how successful you are , " he once said			1
" you always remember what it feels like to go to the unemployment office , what it feels like to be fired from all those restaurants			2
" camaraderie acting was his home			1
he knew it as a 12 - year - old watching @entity67 's " @entity66 " in his hometown of @entity69 , @entity70 , he said in a 2010 interview			2
" immediately i knew it was a place i wanted to be , " he said			2
" being around people who were doing that			2
... that 's still kind of what makes me feel comfortable			2
that 's why i 've worked with a lot of the same people over and over again			1
" @entity1 's everyman greatness at the time , @entity1 -- one of four children of a @entity83 staffer and a judge who divorced when he was 9 -- was more of an athlete , a three - sport participant			1
but a neck injury at 14 dashed his sports dreams			2
instead , he hit the stage			2
of course , it was n't all about greasepaint and cheers , he admitted to the @entity21			2
" there was this beautiful girl			2
i had a huge crush on her , and she acted , " he said			2
" it seemed like something worth giving up baseball for			2
" but he was good at acting			2
he passed an audition to a @entity101 , where he met @entity102 , who became a lifelong friend and later directed him in " @entity104 "			0
later , attending @entity105 , he took in all the theater world had to offer			0
" you 're really part of the city			0
the theater is all around you , and if you want to rub your shoulders against it , you can , and if you want to try for usher jobs , or internships at working theaters , you can			0
and i did all that , " he said			0
his other home was with his family			0
he met @entity16 , a costume designer , at @entity15			0
the pair had three children : @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
his children were all younger than 11			0
he doted on his children			0
he was regularly seen with them in his @entity129 neighborhood			0
he brought them to work			1
he noted they were unimpressed , especially with movies			0
' why are we in this warehouse ? why are n't there seats ? is n't this supposed to be a show ? ' " he recalled them asking			0
" i 've taken them and they watch for a bit and it 's like , ' yeah , great @entity146 , that was neat			1
now -- can we please go home ? ' " ' that 's what you do ' still , there was obviously a darkness to @entity1 that came through with his intensity			1
describing " @entity155 , @entity70 , " to the @entity21 , he said , " i 'd finish a scene , walk right off the set , go in the bathroom , close the door and just take some breaths to regain my composure			0
" sources : nearly 50 envelopes of suspected heroin in @entity1 's apartment in an appreciation , @entity167 film critic @entity166 recalled how @entity1 seemed to revel in the unpleasant aspects of his characters , something @entity166 noticed in 2005 's " @entity172			1
" @entity1 apparently fought director @entity67 -- a friend , mind you -- to make @entity172 more difficult , not less			1
" ever since then , i 've been conscious of how much he went out of his way to make his characters unbenign , " wrote @entity166			1
" it was central to his power as an actor , though i wonder if at times he did n't confuse self - hatred for integrity			1
" @entity1 could also be hard on himself , @entity166 added -- and @entity1 , in other interviews , agreed			1
while making 2010 's " @entity183 , " his feature directorial debut , he told an interviewer at the @entity188 film festival that he was his own worst critic			0
" i was a bad actor in front of me a lot , " he said			1
" there were some days when it was real dark			0
" in recent months , he 'd had his share of challenges			0
he was up front about his struggle with drug abuse , telling @entity199 last year he 'd gone to a rehab facility after falling off the wagon			1
according to the @entity203 newspaper @entity202 , he and @entity16 had separated last fall after 14 years together			0
observers commented that he looked disheveled at the @entity205 in january , though @entity207 's @entity206 described him as " present and engaged			0
" but if anything was wrong , he kept it to himself			0
for all his familiarity and politeness , he could be guarded			0
he left it all on set or on stage			0
in that 2010 @entity188 interview , with a touch of black humor , he talked about how hard it was to keep pushing the boulder up the hill			0
why do " @entity221 , " he asked			0
why put yourself on stage for hours , convinced you 're terrible , and wait for the approval -- or disapproval -- of the audience ? because that 's what makes it worthwhile , he said			0
" that road to death we call life can be just burgers and booze and women and smokes and tv and magazines and really bad arts , and you just go and slide right into the hole , " he said			0
" or you can go , i think i 'd better keep confronting and keep challenging and keep trying to make good stuff and working hard			0
... that 's what you do			0
if you do n't do that , it 's so easy to go to that other place			0
" on her @entity254 page , @entity251 , who co-starred with @entity1 in a 2009 production of " @entity221 , " could only quote from that @entity255 play			1
" the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree , sing all a green @entity259 hand on her bosom , her head on her knee , sing willow , willow , willow.the fresh streams ran by her , and murmur 'd her @entity268 willow , willow , @entity271 salt tears fell from her , and soften 'd the @entity274 willow , willow , willow			0
