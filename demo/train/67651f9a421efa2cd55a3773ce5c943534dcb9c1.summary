-- @entity2 's new ceo is no @entity3 , says @entity5 co-founder @entity4 , who first met @entity3 when his company employed him in 1974 as a $ 5 - an - hour developer			1
" if i were to choose somebody to run international manufacturing and processing and keep the wheels on the bus , @entity8 is about as good as anybody can get , " said @entity4			1
" but i just feel like somebody needs to stick a little bit of dynamite under his left cheek			2
" @entity4 is author of the new book , " finding the @entity20 @entity3 : how to find , keep and @entity21			1
" he spoke to @entity0 about his former employee 's legacy -- just days before the second anniversary of @entity3 ' death on october 5 , 2011 -- and what it will take for a new tech visionary to emerge today			1
to be sure , @entity2 continues to succeed			2
its new @entity29 models sold more than 9 million units in their first weekend , and the company has earned praise for overhauling its @entity34 mobile operating system			1
but @entity4 , who also founded the @entity36 's pizza franchise , said profits today are n't the same , or even as important , as success tomorrow			1
" i have a feeling -- and this is a funny thing that happens with people who are very buttoned down -- that ( @entity8 ) probably thinks he 's innovating , when in fact it 's just micro-evolution , " he said			2
" they were able to build ( the new iphones ) cheaper , which is something i would expect @entity8 to do			2
" but the market cap of @entity2 is underpinned by its innovation margin , " @entity4 said , which he believes " has a shelf life of maybe three to five years			1
then , all of a sudden , the followers have matched you feature by feature			2
" @entity4 is more impressed with @entity57 's approach , which focuses on testing new products and ideas even when some might fail			1
it may lead to some clunkers , but it 's also produced things like a self - driving car and the @entity66 connected headset			1
@entity4 says @entity66 might not be a huge seller , but it represents a big step toward creating the technology of the future			1
" i use some @entity2 products and like them , " he said			2
" but i lately have been spending much more time in the @entity57 - sphere than the @entity2 - sphere			1
" @entity4 reflected on his memories of @entity3 , who at 19 showed up in sandals at @entity5 and demanded an interview , and shared his thoughts on the future of innovation			1
on hiring the unconventional @entity3 " understand that we at @entity5 at the time thought of ourselves as being quite counterculture			1
we were really young and somewhat arrogant and we really felt that we could rewrite the rules in an absolute way			2
we took the attitude of hiring for intensity or passion			2
that really worked for us			1
we felt that we could train anybody that had the passion and fire in their belly			2
@entity3 -- actually both @entity95 ( referring to @entity3 ' longtime friend and collaborator @entity96 ) -- had passion that was a very different passion , but it was passion			1
... @entity3 loved kind of seeing the world as it could be , as opposed to what it is			1
that was an important thing about what our ethic was			0
" on why he did n't invest early in @entity2 " i did n't think that @entity3 would be a good chief executive and i did n't have the time to do it			1
i 've often thought one of the unsung heroes was actually ( early investor and second @entity2 ceo ) @entity114 , who actually provided the adult supervision for the first few years , which i think was really important			0
if i 'd invested and @entity114 had n't been there , the outcome could have been very different			0
" on ' celebrating failure ' " i do n't strive for failure			0
but what you want to do is strive for appropriate risk			0
one of the ways you can thwart appropriate risk is by making the penalties for failure high			0
it 's a little bit like the @entity127 and their idea of forgiveness and absolution and all that			0
most employees who are really good employees , if they screw up , they feel really bad about it			0
what you want to do is you want to give them absolution			0
" " i defy you to find somebody who 's known as an innovator or visionary who has n't had multiple failures			1
it 's really about doing			0
it 's really about ... being a prime mover that allows you to become a visionary			0
it 's an uncharted path , and when you 're on an uncharted path you end up in a cul de sac every once in a while			0
that does n't mean that your overall direction is n't correct			0
you just have to back up and maybe move a little bit more to the right this time , or to the left			0
" on corporate culture " a good company basically says , ' we do n't care what you do			1
we do n't care how you do it			0
you 're going to be judged on your outcomes , period			0
' when @entity5 started in @entity166 , then @entity2 , we were the first and only places where engineers did n't come to work in a coat and tie			1
so guys who are wearing shorts and t - shirts and flip - flops to work now need to say thank you very much			1
" " from a corporate standpoint , think about the difference between the way you think about @entity57 and the way you think about @entity181			1
at the outset -- eight years ago , five years ago -- @entity181 had significantly more resources that they could have been innovating with than @entity57 did			0
@entity57 has the one cash cow ( search ) , but they are planting seeds for their future that i think are extraordinary			0
" on napping at work " think of your body as your innovation instrument			0
it turns out that all kinds of cognitive functions are increased in the afternoon with just a 20 - minute nap			2
( @entity197 studies showed ) a 15 to 30 % increase in cognitive ability after a 20 - minute nap			2
it 's just silly to not do that			0
" on finding the next @entity3 " i think there are thousands of them out there			1
i think the main issue is going to be , are they going to be allowed to perform ? remember , @entity3 was at an integral point where he was product maven and had control of tremendous amounts of resources at his fingertips			1
a lot of the @entity216 out there do n't have that control , do n't have those resources at their disposal			0
they have to be given them			0
when i hear a company say ' we 'll vote on that ' or ' we 'll get consensus , ' you know that they 're going to be mediocre			2
true innovation has no consistency			0
nobody sees it until it 's done			0
