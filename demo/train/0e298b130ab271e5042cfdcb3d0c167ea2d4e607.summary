@entity0 -- a @entity3 lawyer testified friday the department does not enforce certain voting law cases when the victims are white , and called the decision to drop a voter intimidation case against the @entity9 " a travesty of justice			1
" @entity12 , who headed the department 's @entity14 section in 2008 , said he believes some senior civil rights officials at the @entity3 enforce voting cases " in a racially selective manner			1
" @entity12 testified , against the instructions of his @entity3 bosses , before the @entity21 , saying he felt obligated to correct statements made by the current voting rights section chief that race is not a factor in deciding which cases to pursue			1
@entity12 said there has been a long - held hostility by some @entity3 lawyers toward voting rights cases against @entity32 defendants			1
one staff researcher " informed me in no uncertain terms that he had not come to the @entity36 section to sue @entity32 - @entity32 defendants , " @entity12 testified			2
and the election of president @entity50 " brought to positions of influence and power within the @entity42 many of the very people who had demonstrated hostility to the concept of equal enforcement of the @entity48 , " @entity12 said			2
among those promoted was a lawyer who , @entity12 said , had prohibited him from asking job applicants if they would enforce the voting laws in a race - neutral manner			1
a @entity3 spokesman friday afternoon called the @entity21 's investigation " thin on facts and evidence and thick on rhetoric			1
" " the department makes enforcement decisions based on the merits , not the race , gender or ethnicity of any party involved , " spokeswoman @entity62 said			0
@entity71 case stemmed from an incident on november 4 , 2008 -- election day -- when two members of the party stood outside a @entity77 polling station yelling racial slurs			0
both men wore paramilitary outfits and black books ; one held a nightstick			0
no voters filed complaints in the incident , but it was captured on video and appeared on national television			0
@entity12 told the @entity21 , " white voters also have an interest in being able to go to the polls without having race - haters such as @entity94 king @entity93 -- whose public rhetoric includes such statements as ' kill cracker babies ' -- standing at the entrance of the polling place with a billy club in his hand hurling racial slurs			1
" he called it " outrageous conduct " and a " travesty of justice for the @entity3 not to allow attorneys in the @entity108 to obtain nationwide injunctive relief against all four of the defendants			0
" the @entity111 - era @entity3 charged the @entity9 and three of its members with voter intimidation , and a judge entered a default judgment against them the following april when they failed to appear in court			2
but in may of 2009 , the @entity3 dismissed the cases against all the defendants except the man carrying the nightstick			2
@entity12 declined to discuss the @entity3 's internal deliberations on the matter , saying he was honoring the department 's assertion that internal discussions are protected from disclosure			1
but he acknowledged reports that he had fought the dismissal of the charges , including one heated confrontation in which he cursed at a more senior official			0
the decision to drop the case " was intended to send a direct message " that the filing of similar voting cases " would not continue in the @entity50 administration , " @entity12 testified he said he was specifically instructed not to pursue cases against jurisdictions for having ineligible voters on their voting rolls , saying one jurisdiction had 130 percent more voters on its rolls than it had adult residents			2
but he did not ascribe racial motives to that order , saying instead he believed that his bosses would rather leave 100 non-eligible people on voter rolls rather than risk taking one person off who is eligible			0
nonetheless , he said , it is wrong to ignore voter list violations because the violations make vote fraud easier to conceal			0
@entity12 ' testimony follows that of former justice department attorney @entity161 , who also testified there was a " pervasive hostility " in the @entity3 toward enforcing voting rights cases against african - americans			1
the @entity3 friday said it is committed to the color - blind enforcement of laws			2
" let 's not forget the context in which these allegations are being made , " spokesman @entity62 said in a written statement			0
" the politicization that occurred in the @entity42 in the previous administration has been well documented by the inspector general , and it was a disgrace to the great history of the division			0
" the @entity94 case has been a contentious matter before the @entity21			0
one hearing this summer erupted in shouting between commission members , with conservative commission members accusing the @entity3 of " stonewalling " the commission 's investigation into the dismissed charges , and a liberal commission member , in turn , calling those complaints the " last gasps of a conservative majority of this commission			1

@entity3 lawyer says some civil rights cases are *suppressed*
cases against african - americans are not pursued , says @entity12
the @entity3 *criticizes* the @entity21 's investigation
