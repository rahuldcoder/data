-- the tiny puppy with the white and brown fur does n't have a name yet , just a number : 917			0
when he was found , the 8 - week - old puppy weighed less than five pounds and had been left in the scorching sun , wearing a chain around his neck that weighed four times as much as he did			0
he is one of 371 dogs seized by federal and state authorities last month in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 in what authorities say was the second largest dogfighting ring in the @entity22			1
normally , dogfighters wait until the canines are at least half a year old before they chain them and expose them to extreme heat or cold as part of a brutal program to transform the dogs into fighters , according to @entity33 ceo @entity32			1
this puppy was one of several " 8 - and 10 - week - old puppies on heavy , heavy long chains " found during last month 's raids , according to @entity32			1
@entity33 investigators were present during the raids			1
" what we saw on this property brought even our hardened investigators to their knees , so to speak , " he said			0
the dogs were placed in the temporary care of the @entity33 and the @entity49			1
more than 250 of them -- including puppy no. 917 -- were brought to a converted air - conditioned warehouse , where the @entity33 is caring for them			1
the others are in the care of the @entity56			0
this month , @entity0 was granted exclusive access to the @entity33 's rehabilitation of the former fighting dogs			1
@entity0 is not disclosing the location of the rehabilitation center for security reasons			1
not only are the dogs getting medical treatment for malnourishment and injuries sustained in fighting , @entity32 said the canines also are getting " a personal behavior modification enrichment plan to maximize each dog 's opportunity to be placed in a home			1
" the goal is to turn these fighting dogs into animals that can be pets or work as rescue and rehabilitation animals			1
" what we will do is go to each dog individually and assess their strengths and their weaknesses , " said @entity32			0
@entity84 grapples with stray dog epidemic fighting scars if he had n't been rescued , 917 and the other puppies would have likely become typical dogs bred to fight			1
some of those fights , prosecutors say , brought in as much as $ 200,000			0
getting the animal into top physical condition is often the priority for those who train fighting dogs , and that usually begins with a few months lifting a heavy chain			1
next the dog is put in " the keep , " an intensive training program before its first fight			0
when deemed ready , the dogs will be put into the " fighting pit " -- either in a test fight or " the show , " a fight in front of spectators			1
" those fights can last 30 minutes , an hour , two hours , even three hours , " @entity32 said " that 's where the physical wounds are sustained			2
" although 917 was too young to sustain injuries and scars from a fight , many of the other canines seized in last month 's raid show evidence of being in a fighting pit			1
at the @entity33 shelter , dr. @entity119 conducts an examination on one of the rescued dog			1
on the table is a dog so skinny that his ribs and vertebrae are visible through his fur			0
" he clearly has n't been well cared for , " she said			0
" his body condition score is probably 2 out of 9			0
" the cuts , scars and large tumor on his paw suggest a very hard 10 years for this animal , which likely made more than one appearance in the fighting pit			2
since arriving in the shelter , the dog has been dewormed and given medicine for fleas and to manage his pain			0
the prognosis is good : @entity147 said she believes with the proper care this dog will have a good quality of life			0
raiding the dogfighting ring last month 's raid on the dogfighting ring started with a sliver of information			1
" in 2010 we got a tip from a drug defendant that there were high - stakes dogfighting going on in @entity164 , @entity15 , " said @entity158 , a federal prosecutor in @entity15			2
that led to an investigation in @entity15 that turned up more evidence of dogfighting in nearby states			2
authorities executed 13 warrants in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , which led to 12 arrests			2
those arrested have since entered pleas of not guilty to a variety of federal charges , including conspiracy to promote and sponsor dogfights and conducting a gambling business			0
" these defendants were gambling anywhere from between $ 1,500 to $ 200,000 on one dogfight , according to our investigation , " said @entity158 , who is prosecuting the case			0
if convicted the defendants face up to 15 years in prison			0
a trial is scheduled for february			0
the government plans to forfeit the rights to the dogs and @entity158 hopes that permanent custody will go to the organizations that are currently caring for them			2
" as much as i would love to parade these horribly scared dogs through the courtroom at trial i do n't think any judge is going to let me , so i am not going to need the physical dogs , " @entity158 said			2
feds : busted dogfighters earn spot in ' lowest places in hell ' healing mental wounds the once empty @entity33 shelter is now lined with rows upon rows of cages that contain a variety of dogs of all ages			1
a walk past the cages will prompt some dogs to incessantly bark , others to jump up and down			2
the most dramatic reaction is from a black pit bull mix that appears to panic at the sight of a person			0
his ears stand straight up and he cowers in the corner of his cage as his body trembles			0
" understand that these dogs have experienced nothing but life at the end of a chain , " @entity32 explained			2
" even a water bowl is new for them ... they are afraid of everything			0
" to emphasize his point , a sign that reads " i 'm fearful , please go slowly " hangs on one dog 's cage			2
certified dog trainer @entity241 moves slowly as she works to gain the trust of an older dog that also has been labeled fearful			0
she is on her knees in a pen reserved for training and she has the dog on a leash			0
in a friendly yet calm and quiet voice , @entity249 - @entity241 repeats the phrase " good girl , good girl " while throwing treats near the animal			2
after a few minutes she asks the dog , " ready to come close ? " and she holds out an open hand with a treat in it			0
the dog takes the treat and @entity261 gives the dog a break by throwing the next treat away from her to reduce the animal 's anxiety from being so close to a human			1
the @entity33 is doing all it can to rehabilitate these dogs so they can eventually be given to organizations that will either find them a home as a pet , train them as work dogs , or put them in alternative placements such as a sanctuary			1
maybe one day , the dogs , like 917 , can have real names instead of numbers			2
" a lot of people have this misperception of fighting dogs being big brutish pit bulls that are killers , " said @entity282 , the shelter 's senior manager , who spends all day with the dogs			1
" in reality , some of these guys are traumatized from the experience they 've been through from lack of socialization , the torture			0
" while these dogs may have been saved from a life a torture , the @entity33 estimates there are more than 40,000 dogfighters in the @entity22 who are putting hundreds of thousands of animals through the brutal training to become fighting dogs			1
" this may be the second largest dogfighting bust in @entity22 history , but it 's a drop in the bucket , " said @entity32			1
" this is going on all over the @entity22 across socioeconomic lines , across racial lines , it is prevalent , it is pervasive , it is deep underground			0
" @entity0 's @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			1
