when was the last time you saw a blockbuster film that did n't include a gun ? it might be hard to remember			2
@entity6 love movies that depict violence , a new study shows ; 94 % of the most popular movies since 1985 contain at least one violent scene , and half of those involve a gun			1
for the study , published this week in the scientific journal @entity16 , researchers analyzed the 30 top - grossing films every year from 1950 to 2012			1
they identified violent sequences in each movie and noted whether the scenes included a character carrying a gun with the intention of harming or killing a living target			2
since 1950 , violence in films has more than doubled , the study authors concluded			1
perhaps more surprising is that gun violence in @entity30 films has tripled since 1985 , even exceeding the amount found in r - rated films in more recent years			1
" parents need to realize that just because a movie has been rated @entity30 does not mean that their 13 - year - old should go to see it , " study author @entity33 said			1
" we would like to see @entity38 go back to labeling movies with lots of violence , and gun violence in particular , with an r rating , just like they have been doing for explicit sex all along			1
" the average @entity6 sees seven movies in theaters every year , according to @entity49 's @entity48			0
those rated @entity30 are often the highest - grossing , bringing in about 45 % of the market share			1
the @entity52 first began using the pg - 13 rating in 1985			2
the rating urges parents to be cautious , saying " some material may be inappropriate for pre-teenagers , " but theaters do not check ids for those seeing a @entity30 movie			1
and some worry that exposing children to violence on the screen may encourage them to act it out in real life			1
" there has been a long line of research showing that continued exposure to screen violence among children , mainly on tv , predicts the emergence of later aggressive behavior , " @entity33 said			2
" we do n't know if seeing gun violence on the screen has a unique effect , but it is concerning considering that we have seen a rise in the use of guns in schools and other settings in recent years			1
" experts are still debating whether watching violent movies or playing violent games leads to real - life violence			1
in 2000 , a coalition of public health organizations , including the @entity93 and the @entity94 , published a joint statement , saying science had clearly shown " a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children			2
" they said viewing violence led children to view aggressive acts as acceptable behavior and to become emotionally desensitized			0
the effects were " measurable and long - lasting , " according to the statement			0
since then , several scientific studies have shown just the opposite			0
and the @entity94 has convened a task force to review the new evidence and potentially update its position			0
" the problem is that people are looking for a yes - or - no answer ... when there is none , " @entity112 , professor of psychology at @entity114 , wrote in an opinion article for @entity116			0
@entity112 and his colleagues recently conducted a study that showed college students who played violent video games for 20 minutes at a time for three days showed more aggressive behavior each day they played			0
" the argument i hear most often is that video games ca n't be dangerous because millions of people play these games without becoming violent , " @entity112 wrote			0
" that 's because they come from good homes , are n't victims of bullying , do n't have mental health issues and do n't have many of the other risk factors for violence			0
but what about players who are already predisposed to violence ? " those who do n't believe a link exists have crime data on their side			0
coinciding with the rise of violent video games and violence in movies is a significant decrease in juvenile violent crime			0
in 1993 , at the peak , teens aged 12 to 17 had a serious violent crime offending rate of 52 crimes per 1,000 juveniles , according to the @entity158			0
by 2011 , that number had dropped to just six crimes per 1,000 juveniles			0
while the study authors saw gun violence in @entity30 films triple , the same was not true for @entity165 / @entity30 - rated films			1
violence in r - rated films held at a steady rate while @entity170 - rated films saw a decrease over the same time period .			2

since 1950 , violence in films has more than doubled , a new study finds
in @entity30 films , gun violence *specifically* has tripled since 1985
experts are still debating whether watching violence promotes it in real life
