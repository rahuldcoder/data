@entity0 -- thousands of @entity2 filled @entity0 's @entity3 on wednesday , exactly one year after the start of the revolution that ousted longtime @entity2 ruler @entity6 but , many say , accomplished little else			1
at times the mood in the square was somber and tense amid fears that violence could break out between protesters and the military			2
many people held banners as they chanted slogans against the country 's military leaders			0
but some celebrated the anniversary and said @entity2 has progressed since @entity6 's ouster			1
" this time last year , every person in @entity2 was enslaved to @entity6 's regime , and those who dared speak or write about his tyranny paid a high price , " said @entity22 , a teacher			1
" yes , the revolution may not be complete , but i think we have come a long way , and no one can deny it			0
" are you there ? share your perspective from @entity2			0
@entity2 's revolution last year came on the heels of @entity40 's revolt that led to the ouster of that country 's leader in january 2011			1
since then , protests against longtime rulers swept across @entity46 and the @entity47 , including uprisings in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
signs of progress toward a more democratic system in @entity2 after the revolution contrasted with the feeling that the real changes protesters had hoped for have not been realized			2
@entity2 's democratically elected parliament met monday for the first time since @entity6 was ousted after decades of authoritarian rule			1
but the country 's influential military , which stepped into the vacuum as @entity6 teetered last year , retains much of the decision - making power			1
pro-democracy activists , frustrated by what they say is the slow pace of change , have clashed with the military in @entity0 's streets in recent months			1
" it is ironic that the most times i 've ever been beaten , the most times i 've ever felt the threat of danger , was after @entity6 stepped down , " @entity72 , an activist who was 20 at the time of @entity6 's fall , said in a recent interview			1
" and all of these are very basic indications that the regime that is ruling us at the moment is merely a continuation of the @entity6 regime			0
" photos : looking back at @entity2 's uprising in the recent parliamentary elections , established @entity91 parties like the @entity92 performed much more strongly than the liberal parties that represented some of the protesters			1
and a new constitution has yet to be drawn up			0
some @entity2 have said the hopes forged by protesters in the heady days of january and february last year were doomed to fall short			2
" there were too many expectations , " said @entity100 , a newspaper publisher and human rights activist			0
" raising the expectations was probably the biggest mistake , and media probably have a great part to do with that			0
" @entity109 said she was planning to spend the night in @entity3 with her friends , hoping to put pressure on military junta to reaffirm their transfer of power on time , end military tribunals of civilians , increase wages and reimburse families of the of those killed during @entity2 's upheaval			2
but most of all , @entity109 said , she wanted a guilty verdict for @entity6 , whom she said robbed the nation for decades and " watched his people die in the hundreds without ordering his soldiers to stop			2
" the ailing @entity6 is on trial on charges of corruption and ordering the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the clashes last year that led to his downfall			1
he has denied the charges			0
@entity1 's @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
