-- the mother of passenger no. 63 aboard @entity3 is unable to come out of the shadows of her son 's misdeed to mourn with the rest of the families whose loved ones disappeared on march 8			1
" as a human being , as a mother , nobody thought of me			2
i am alone with no support except for @entity15 , " she wrote after @entity0 tried to contact her about her son			2
she is suffering alone because she has shied away from the epicenter of information in @entity18			2
she is n't there to attend the briefings , or to get the grief counseling provided by @entity22			0
she is a mother whose son broke the law to get on the plane , and she is now paying for it			1
her son is 18 - year - old @entity27			1
he and his friend @entity29 , 29 , were the two @entity31 men who boarded the @entity22 flight using stolen passports , investigators say			1
they were two of the first people to come under suspicion in the plane 's disappearance			1
@entity22 says it has not been in contact with the families			0
their case is in the hands of investigators , a company representative told @entity0			2
but investigators cleared them of any wrongdoing in connection with the disappearance of the plane early in the investigation			1
@entity27 's mother is acutely aware that her son did something illegal , but she says he just wanted to explore his " beautiful dreams			1
" " i dedicated my life to my sons , and all i wanted was for them to be happy in their life			0
i wanted them to live a free life			2
i had prayed that i would see him again , but that did n't happen			0
we will see each other in eternity now			0
" going on after sudden loss of a loved one she pours out her grief with pictures of her son , messages to him and symbols of their @entity72 faith posted on her @entity74 page			2
" ... from the moment i became a mother , all i wanted and asked from @entity15 was to not see my children die before me			2
but of course that did n't happen , " she wrote			0
@entity0 met with a friend who dropped @entity27 off at the airport on march 8 in @entity18			1
the friend said that all @entity27 wanted was to find " freedom			1
" he boarded the plane with a plan to live in @entity87 with his mother and never return to @entity31 , his friend said			1
his friend did not want to be identified for fear that being associated with the men traveling on stolen passports would make him a target for harassment by authorities when he travels in and out of @entity31			2
but he says @entity27 's mother called him , looking for answers : " she was so sad			1
she was asking me , ' when my son was there , was he happy ? he was enjoying ? ' " and i said , ' yeah , as i see			2
he was happy and he was enjoying			0
' then she just said , ' thank @entity15			0
' " @entity99 has rebutted @entity101 's explanation for not checking an international database of lost and stolen passports when passengers boarded @entity3 , an omission that may have allowed @entity27 and @entity29 onto the plane			1
@entity101 home minister datuk seri @entity106 told the @entity107 last week that using @entity99 's @entity110 ( @entity109 ) database might have slowed down the process of immigration checks at airport counters			0
he said the country 's immigration equipment could not handle the global database of 40.2 million lost passports			0
@entity99 fired back , saying the problem can not be blamed on technology or the agency			0
" @entity99 's @entity109 database takes just seconds to reveal whether a passport is listed , with recent tests providing results in 0.2 seconds , " the international law enforcement agency said in a statement			1
" the fact is that the @entity127 consults this database more than 230 million times per year ; the @entity131 more than 140 million times ; the @entity133 more than 100 million times and @entity134 more than 29 million times			0
not one of these countries , or indeed any @entity99 member country , has ever stated that the response time is too slow			0
" @entity27 's @entity74 message four days before he got on the plane shows him standing below an iconic @entity101 skyscraper with the words , " feeling excited			1
" he never made it to his final destination , just like the other passengers and crew of the missing @entity22 flight			0
@entity27 's mother left this message , hoping it would not fall on deaf ears just because her son broke the law : " although he had a stolen passport , " his mother said , " he was so young with many beautiful dreams			1
i 'm a mother just like the @entity162 mothers , and i want to know what happened too			0
i trust in @entity15 and whatever he wants will happen			0
but all 239 persons are the same , maybe somebody does n't believe that			1
" 6 missteps in the investigation read the cockpit transcript flight 370 : high - tech search tools @entity0 's @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
