-- heavy flooding in @entity2 caused by torrential rains has forced mass evacuations from towns along the country 's east coast , with critically - ill patients and newborns from one hospital being airlifted to safety			1
the floods , which came in the aftermath of @entity14 , have killed four people so far , including a three - year - old boy who died after being hit by a falling tree in @entity18 , @entity2 's third largest city			1
@entity19 , a coastal town about 360 kilometers ( 220 miles ) northwest of @entity18 , was particularly hard hit , with more than 2,000 homes inundated with water and a similar number of people evacuated , said mayor @entity26			1
" we 're like a little island			0
we have water either side of us and the water is flowing rapidly , " @entity26 told @entity0 by telephone from his office in @entity19 's town center			1
" people are very bewildered			2
" some of the town 's roads were under six or seven meters of water and some one - storey houses were completely covered , @entity26 added			1
@entity19 's hospital was also evacuated as the flood waters continued to advance			1
a spokeswoman for @entity2 's @entity43 said that about 130 patients were being airlifted to hospitals in @entity18 as a precaution			1
if the floodwaters reached 10.1 meters , it would affect the hospital sewage system , making the hospital clinically unsafe , the spokeswoman said			2
" i think they are expected to rise to 9.8 meters and that 's a bit too close for comfort			2
we started transferring the most critical patients last night			0
the rest will be evacuated today			2
" around 10 newborn babies and at - risk patients were taken to @entity18 in the early hours of tuesday , while two c - 130 aircraft from the @entity60 arrived in @entity19 later that morning to evacuate the remaining patients and some pregnant women nearing full term			1
evacuations have also been ordered in the town of @entity66 in @entity67 , about 600 kilometers ( 370 miles ) north of @entity68			0
in @entity18 , residents were being asked to limit water use after a water treatment plant was clogged up by silted water			0
but the city appeared to escape major flooding after waters peaked at a lower level than forecast			0
an aerial photo taken above @entity19 posted by @entity78 on his @entity80 account showed vast swathes of land under water			2
" extent of the flooding is staggering , " he said in the post			0
prime minister @entity89 said that 100 @entity2 military personnel had been deployed to @entity19 , where the @entity91 is expected to peak at around 9.6 meters on tuesday , breaking a 1942 record			1
" currently it 's sitting at 9.525 meters , we believe it has just peaked half an hour ago			0
it 's a record for us , " @entity26 said			0
a dozen helicopters , some equipped with night vision , were used to rescue 1,000 stranded residents , many plucked from their rooftops			1
" there 's debris everywhere , the trampolines are everywhere , all the kids stuff is everywhere -- it 's just gone , " @entity103 , who was among those winched to safety , told @entity106			0
residents and officials are being particularly cautious , after flooding caused by heavy rains in late 2010 and 2011 left much of @entity115 , known as the " @entity115 " , under water			0
those floods killed 35 people			0
more areas are expected to face flooding later in the week as swollen rivers and tributaries make their way toward the coast			0
extra police have been deployed in flood - hit regions to prevent looting .			1
