@entity0 , @entity1 -- a wrenching court fight -- about who is alive , who is dead and how the presence of a fetus changes the equation -- came to an end sunday when a brain - dead , pregnant @entity1 woman was taken off a ventilator			1
the devices that had kept @entity16 's heart and lungs working for two months were switched off about 11:30 a.m. sunday , her family 's attorneys announced			2
" may @entity16 finally rest in peace , and her family find the strength to complete what has been an unbearably long and arduous journey , " the lawyers , @entity19 and @entity20 , said in a written statement			1
@entity16 was 14 weeks pregnant with the couple 's second child when her husband found her unconscious on their kitchen floor november 26			2
though doctors had pronounced her brain dead and her family had said she did not want to have machines keep her body alive , officials at @entity32 in @entity0 had said state law required them to maintain life - sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient			1
attorneys : fetus was ' distinctly abnormal ' sunday 's announcement came two days after a judge in @entity0 ordered the hospital to remove any artificial means of life support from @entity16 by 5 p.m. monday			1
earlier sunday , the hospital said it intended to comply with that order			2
" the past eight weeks have been difficult for the @entity16 family , the caregivers and the entire @entity53 community , which found itself involved in a sad situation , " a hospital statement said			1
" @entity57 has followed what we believed were the demands of a state statute			0
" the hospital acknowledged friday that @entity16 , 33 , had been brain dead since november 28 and that the fetus she carried was not viable			1
her husband , @entity65 , had argued that sustaining her body artificially amounted to " the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body " against her wishes and those of her family			0
@entity16 did n't leave any written directives regarding end - of - life care , but her husband and other family members said she had told them she did n't want machines to keep her blood pumping			2
the ethics of life support in an affidavit filed thursday in court , @entity65 said little to him was recognizable about his wife			0
her bones crack when her stiff limbs move			0
her usual scent has been replaced by the " smell of death			0
" and her once lively eyes have become " soulless			0
" the hospital 's position drew support from demonstrators outside the hospital , some of whom held signs last week that read " @entity98 stands for life " and " praying for @entity100 and family			0
" but others countered with placards bearing messages like " let @entity16 rest in peace " and " @entity107 's wishes			1
" what no one wants to talk about			0

" may @entity16 finally rest in peace , " family lawyers say
@entity16 has been brain dead since november
a hospital had kept her body on a ventilator to preserve the fetus she carried
a judge ordered that to stop by monday , and the hospital says it will comply
