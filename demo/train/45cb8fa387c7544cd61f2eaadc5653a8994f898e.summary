@entity0 -- even though the @entity5 elections wo n't be decided until the polls close tonight , the @entity3 bookies late last week started paying off bettors who predicted @entity8 would win a majority in the @entity10			1
and they stopped making new bets			0
that 's a pretty definite statement ! although i am very confident my party ( @entity8 ) will win the @entity10 , i usually like to wait until the voters have voted before taking any victory laps			1
many of my pundit friends have had a field day attempting to analyze , over the last several weeks , the early voting patterns of those of you who have cast ballots already and argue what it all means			0
i have always been more concerned with the late counting of votes rather than the early voting			0
and because so many races are so close , this is one election in which every vote can matter			1
follow the latest on the election at @entity1 's @entity32 there is an old saying in the business : " we only hold elections to see if the pollsters are right ! " and if the pollsters are right , it will be a big night for @entity8 and a lot of second - guessing at the @entity42			1
certainly viewers will know some trends and results shortly after the polls close			2
but in other cases , it will be late tuesday and maybe even sometime wednesday before we know the final results -- particularly in the @entity50 , where key @entity52 races may alter the final outcome			2
here is what 's at stake : there are 37 @entity50 races being contested ( 19 @entity59 and 18 @entity8 )			1
fourteen of those seats are open , meaning either the incumbent is not running for re-election or has been defeated in a primary			0
in order to win a @entity50 majority , @entity8 have to hold @entity66 and all their open seats : @entity69 , @entity68 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
and they must win 10 @entity59 seats			2
if any of the @entity8 seats go to @entity59 , the @entity59 will continue to hold the majority			1
everyone has all but conceded two @entity59 open seats : the @entity82 seat will be won by @entity83 gov. @entity83 , and the @entity85 open seat is likely to be won by former sen. @entity86 , also a @entity8			2
more opinion on the election the most vulnerable @entity59 running for re-election are sens. @entity90 of @entity91 ; @entity92 of @entity93 ; and @entity94 of @entity95 , the @entity50 majority leader			2
the @entity95 election is the most heavily watched race in the country , and it has been neck and neck in the polls			0
@entity94 's opponent is @entity103 , a @entity104 - backed candidate and former @entity8 state legislator			1
this race has gone back and forth , but @entity107 took a narrow lead going into the final weekend after surviving millions of dollars of negative advertisements			0
if she wins , this will be the biggest story of the night			0
the next best chances for @entity8 gains are the @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 open seats			2
the @entity50 race between @entity59 gov. @entity119 and businessman @entity120 has been a back - and - forth contest			0
if @entity120 upsets the popular governor , @entity8 are in the chase to make the @entity50 very close			1
other vulnerable democrats are sens. @entity125 of @entity126 , @entity127 of @entity128 and @entity129 of @entity130			0
here is what 's happening in the @entity10 : all 435 seats are up , and 43 seats are open ( 20 @entity59 and 23 @entity8 are not running for re-election )			1
in the present @entity137 , there are 256 @entity59 and 179 republicans			0
@entity1 has systematically chosen 100 congressional races to focus on			0
fifty are viewed as the most competitive			0
four of these are @entity8 and the rest @entity59			2
they have listed another 50 @entity10 races to watch			1
five of these are @entity8 and the rest @entity59			2
this is a far larger number than in most midterm elections , but all of these races have shown signs they are competitive			0
republicans must win 39 seats to win the majority			1
if early in the evening , @entity59 incumbents start losing in the early returns from states such as @entity0 , @entity116 , @entity70 and @entity71 , then it is likely the trend predicted for @entity8 to gain a majority in the @entity10 will come true			1
there are 16 vulnerable seats in those four states and another 11 on the watch list			0
if at the end of the night you see that either the dean of the @entity10 -- @entity167 of @entity168 who has been in @entity137 since 1955 -- or @entity170 of @entity171 has lost , then you know it 's been a historic election			1
that sums up the congressional and @entity50 races , but many states have other contests , including 37 governors ' races ( 19 @entity59 , 17 @entity8 and one independent up for election )			1
twenty - four are open seats			0
republicans are expected to easily end up with a majority of governors			1
across the country , there are 6,118 state legislative seats also being contested , along with 160 ballot measures in 37 states			0
tune in for what should be an exciting evening			0
but most of all , go vote ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity198 : @entity3 bookies already paid bettors who predicted @entity8 would win @entity10 majority
because so many races are close , this is one election where every vote matters , @entity198 says
he says republicans are expected to easily end up with a majority of governors
if @entity167 or @entity170 loses , then it 's been a historic election , writes @entity198
