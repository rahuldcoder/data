for anyone who has experienced the brutality of a bully , a blunt - talking mayor in @entity4 with a horseshoe mustache now weighs in with this bit of wisdom : " grow a pair			1
" looking and talking like an @entity11 figure , mayor @entity9 made his declaration while on the dais of the @entity14 last week			1
" i 'm against bullying , but i 'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything and the ills of the world , " @entity9 said during the @entity14 meeting			1
" ( most ) people just have to grow a pair and stick up for them damn selves			2
" @entity9 imparted his advice while discussing a proposal to create an anti-bullying safe zone for students			1
his remark immediately ricocheted around the council chambers -- and , in subsequent days , around the country			0
councilwoman @entity33 immediately challenged the mayor			2
" it 's hard to just grow a pair when you 're a 10 - year - old girl , " @entity33 shot back			2
the councilwoman 's retort was just the beginning of how the mayor 's tough - talking comments have roiled many people nationwide , especially advocates of bullying prevention			2
what 's bullying indeed , in the past few years , a robust debate has been unfolding about what is -- and is n't -- bullying			2
sponsors of @entity52 say it 's wrong to view bullying as " a childhood rite of passage " and something to make " kids tougher			0
" in fact , bullying can be a traumatic experience , causing school avoidance , anxiety , depression and loss of self - esteem			0
some researchers , however , say " bullying " has been misused and misstated in recent years -- recklessly assigned to describe mere slights , teasing or inevitable growing pains in childhood relationships			2
the bald , cigar - smoking @entity9 seemed a little wounded this week by the resulting controversy , but he was n't backing down			1
he has also received some hate e-mail			1
" of course , i wish i would have put it a little different , a little less colorful , but let 's not lose track of what the message is , " @entity9 said in a @entity75 interview			1
watch @entity9 speak about the controversy " we 're starting to define any action that is a little bit controversial as bullying , " he continued			1
" we 're not addressing the fact that the students are running to or running from ( something ) or never allowed through the zero - tolerance policies of the schools to actually stand up for themselves			0
" the one i worry about the most is physical intimidation , and that 's certainly not advocating that we meet violence with violence , " he said			0
" but if somebody puts their hands on you , it 's up to you and your friends to put a stop to this			0
" people should " just tell the bully we 're not going to put up with this , " he said			0
raising two grandchildren @entity9 has been raising two grandchildren for 10 years because he lost his daughter in a wreck			1
" i guarantee i 'm not raising them to be whiny , " @entity9 said			1
but he 's frustrated with school policies that do n't allow bullied pupils to stand up for themselves , he said			2
his grandson came home from school a month ago after he and another boy had a tussle			2
in fact , the principal called @entity9 about the incident			1
" i asked my grandson afterwards , what 'd you do about it ? " @entity9 said			1
" i did n't do anything , " the grandson told him , according to @entity9			1
" why ? " @entity9 said			1
" because i 'll get in trouble , " the grandson told him			0
@entity9 expressed exasperation -- and blamed zero - tolerance zones in school as a big part of the problem			1
those zones empower bullies , @entity9 said			1
" how do you have a safe zone when the schools are telling the kids to stand down and not really holding the bully accountable ? " @entity9 said			1
" they do n't expel them or do n't suspend them			0
they have them come back to class , and you 're brought back in the same environment			0
" when @entity9 was in 7th grade , he was bullied by " a guy that kept pullin ' a knife on me , " he said			1
" i made up excuses not to go to school			0
... i did n't tell my mom and dad what was going on , did n't tell my friends cause i did n't want them to think i was afraid of this guy , " @entity9 said			2
" finally it came to a head			0
i dropped him like a rag doll			0
everything was cool again , " he said			0
hate mail @entity9 acknowledged he 's receiving a lot of e-mail excoriating him			1
" i could show you e-mails right now that would blow your mind , " he said			0
one e-mail was profane and condemning , but @entity9 read it aloud in a @entity75 interview			1
" hey there mayor ... just reading this makes me want to throw up in my mouth , " the e-mail read , according to @entity9			1
" you have no idea what it 's like to be bullied			0
you have no idea what it takes for a 10 - year - old to stand up to someone who is picking on them			0
and you have no idea how much bad press you bring on @entity191			2
that town is a backwards bastion for bigotry , and you made it worse by becoming mayor			0
" among experts taking exception with @entity9 is @entity200 , a @entity201 human behaviorist and therapist who appears on @entity204 television programs			2
" i would like to say that the mayor is actually coming off as a bully , " @entity200 said			0
" you can very easily say ' i 'm against bullying , ' but then blame the people , the victims who were being bullied and say grow a pair			0
" what does that actually mean ? be braver and you wo n't get bullied ? i do n't think that 's how bullying works , " @entity200 said			0
" if we put responsibility on children to do an adult 's job , or to do a politician 's job or to do a teacher 's job , then what we are basically doing is asking children -- children ! -- to be adults			0
