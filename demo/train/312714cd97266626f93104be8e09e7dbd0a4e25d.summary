@entity0 -- the @entity2 gave unanimous support to an @entity6 father 's court fight to regain custody of his daughter living overseas , saying the case is still active even if the child is out of the country			1
this decision could establish important precedent on the discretion of @entity6 courts to decide where youngsters caught in parental fights should stay			2
it also addresses a key question at the intersection of @entity6 and international law			1

the jurisdictional matter before the high court involved a @entity28 sergeant from @entity29 and his @entity31 - born wife , who returned alone to her home country with their daughter , @entity34			0

the @entity63 administration supported the father and the @entity2 ultimately sided with him as well , saying his appeal could continue			0
" the @entity47 mandates the prompt return of children to their countries of habitual residence			0
