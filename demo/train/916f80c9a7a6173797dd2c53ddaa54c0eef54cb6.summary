@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 couple arrived at the @entity4 on the wrong day for a tour recently and got much more than they bargained for			1
after being screened by the @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 of @entity0 , @entity1 , were led into a lavish invitation - only breakfast where they met the president and the first lady			2
how the couple was able to get into the @entity4 event without being on the guest list was called " dumb luck " by the @entity19			1
the @entity4 is calling it a " nice gesture " and has been explaining how this incident is nothing like the breach of security that took place when @entity26 and @entity27 infamously crashed the @entity29 ' state dinner			1
the @entity19 got into the @entity4 on @entity31 , weeks before the @entity33 ' infamous party crashing			1
the couple mistakenly arrived a day early for a tour that was booked by their congressman			2
the @entity4 says it put the @entity19 through the appropriate screenings and criminal background checks before allowing them to go to the @entity31 breakfast because there were no tours scheduled that day			1
@entity44 , 67 , says the whole thing was a surprise to him because at the time he did not realize that he was at the @entity4 on the wrong day			1
@entity9 says he was standing outside the @entity4 security booth with his 62 - year - old wife when he heard : " mr. and mrs. @entity9 , you are cleared to come in			2
" they were led directly to the grand @entity52 where there was a buffet and a crowd of people , some in military uniforms , some in suits			0
@entity9 says he began to get the sinking feeling that this was not the usual tour of the @entity4			2
he went to talk to a @entity4 aide telling the staffer that he may be in the wrong place			2
the staffer , who @entity9 did not know by name , asked him if he was a veteran			0
when @entity9 said he told the staffer he was a @entity70 veteran , the staffer told him to stay for the breakfast			0
" he said , ' go with the flow , ' " @entity9 said			0
a @entity4 spokesman said it was a " nice gesture " that has been done before for those have passed security screenings			1
@entity4 spokesman @entity77 said it is not uncommon for staff to take people who are cleared for tours to other events if there is space available			0
@entity77 said the @entity84 , which @entity85 created to engage citizens in @entity4 activities , was responsible for clearing in the @entity88 , as well as the other breakfast guests			1
@entity7 spokesman @entity90 said agents performed the same screening procedures on the @entity19 that were used for other breakfast guests			0
they checked the @entity19 ' names and did a criminal background check , steps that were not taken for the @entity33 at the november 24 state dinner			1
the @entity19 ate breakfast and then were startled when @entity85 entered the room			0
they got a chance to meet the president , the first lady and the vice president , @entity9 said			0
@entity9 said he was even more startled he returned to his @entity1 home and read his e-mails with @entity109 rep. @entity108 and realized he had been at the @entity4 on the wrong day			1
" it was dumb luck that a veteran of four years was able to meet the president of the @entity109 , who i have lots of support and respect for , " @entity9 said			0
@entity2 's @entity116 and @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
