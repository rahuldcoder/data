@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity7 - @entity6 @entity5 fighters began arriving in the besieged northern @entity9 city of @entity10 from @entity1 , two witnesses said thursday , starting what analysts call a largely symbolic reinforcement of fellow @entity14 defending the town from @entity16			1
about 10 @entity5 fighters entered @entity10 from the @entity1 border in two vehicles , an activist and a @entity9 @entity6 fighter told @entity2 by phone			1
the 10 are among about 160 @entity5 troops that are expected to arrive in @entity10 after traveling from @entity7 through @entity1 , bringing heavy weapons , artillery and gear to help @entity14 in a battle against @entity16 for control of the border town			1
@entity16 , the @entity30 , has been fighting to take @entity10 for about six weeks , hoping to add it to the territory it already captured in parts of @entity9 and @entity7 for what it calls its new independent @entity37 nation			1
@entity9 has been embroiled in a three - year civil war , with government troops battling @entity16 and other rebels elsewhere , leaving @entity10 's ethnic @entity14 to defend the city , with @entity43 airstrikes -- part of a larger @entity43 - led coalition effort against @entity16 in the region -- intermittently taking out @entity16 targets in the area			1
the supplies and troops , though roughly an infantry company - sized contingent , would boost @entity10 's defenders somewhat , given that they 've seen few reinforcements since @entity16 ' siege of the city began in mid-september			1
the @entity5 troops join about 200 @entity9 rebels who , according to @entity9 rebel commander col. @entity58 , entered @entity10 at dawn wednesday			1
@entity5 troops -- @entity14 who defend northern @entity7 's semiautonomous @entity6 region -- are no strangers to @entity16 , having battled them often this year as the militant group tries to expand its @entity7 territory			1
tens of thousands of civilians fled @entity10 and surrounding areas into @entity1 to avoid the fighting			2
what impact will the @entity5 fighters have ? though the @entity14 will welcome the @entity5 , the troop movement does n't necessarily signal a major shift in the fight , analysts say			1
" in terms of a major war that 's of some significance to @entity43 national security , the arrival of 150 militiamen to an area is probably not of tectonic significance , " @entity74 , a senior fellow with the @entity75 , told @entity2 wednesday			2
most tacticians consider @entity10 to be of little inherent strategic interest in the fight against @entity16 , @entity85 defense fellow @entity84 said wednesday			1
the city has attracted a lot of international media attention , in part because it lies just across the border from @entity1 , giving journalists a clear vantage point to report on the battle there			0
@entity16 is also reinforcing its contingent in @entity10 , @entity84 said , setting out the prospect of a protracted fight over the city			2
but there is some military significance , analysts say			0
the fight for @entity10 continues to give @entity43 and allied forces the opportunity to bloody @entity16 there , and to keep its forces tied up , @entity84 said			2
" as long as the city does n't fall , it works to the advantage of the @entity43 strategy , " he said			0
" the @entity16 guys who are fighting in the city are n't available to fight somewhere else			0
" the @entity1 role with @entity16 controlling the @entity9 land surrounding @entity10 , the @entity5 's easiest path into the city was through @entity1			1
and @entity1 's decision to let the @entity5 traverse @entity1 territory represented a major policy shift			2
the @entity9 @entity6 fighters , part of the @entity120 , or @entity120 , have ties to the @entity122 , or @entity122 , which has fought a 30 - year guerrilla war against the government of @entity1 , where about 20 % of the population is @entity6			0
@entity1 , the @entity126 and @entity43 consider the @entity122 a terrorist organization			0
earlier this month , @entity1 president @entity128 said the @entity9 @entity6 and @entity16 militants were " terrorists			0
" the @entity1 government also has bristled at the @entity43 ' efforts to parachute weapons , ammunition and medicine to @entity120 fighters			0
but while @entity1 did nothing to intervene in @entity10 , @entity14 protested in @entity1 streets			0
more than 30 people were killed in cities across the country this month as ethnic @entity14 clashed with @entity142 and nationalist groups , as well as @entity1 police			0
@entity2 's @entity144 reported from near @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity2 's @entity145 and @entity146 reported and wrote in @entity147			0
@entity2 's @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
