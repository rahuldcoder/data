-- on july 23 , 1969 , as @entity2 hurtled back towards @entity3 , there was a problem -- a problem only a kid could solve			1
at age 10 , @entity6 reaches his arm into a tiny hole to fix an antenna crucial to @entity2			1
it sounds like something out of a movie , but that 's what it came down to as @entity2 sped back towards @entity3 after landing on the moon in 1969			1
it was around 10:00 at night on july 23 , and 10 - year - old @entity6 was at home with his mom and three brothers			1
his father , @entity22 , was at work			0
@entity22 was the director of the @entity25 tracking station in @entity26 , where the family was living			0
the @entity26 tracking station was to play a critical role in the return of @entity2 to @entity3			2
a powerful antenna there connected @entity25 communications with @entity2 , and the antenna was the only way for @entity25 to make its last communications with the astronauts before splashdown			1
but at the last minute on that night , a bearing in the antenna failed , rendering it nearly useless			2
to properly replace the bearing would have required dismantling the entire antenna , and there was simply no time			0
so @entity22 thought of a creative solution : if he could get more grease around the failed bearing , it would probably be fine			0
the only problem was , nobody at the station had an arm small enough to actually reach in through the two - and - a - half inch opening and pack grease around the bearing			1
and that 's when @entity6 was called in to save the day			1
@entity22 sent someone out to his home to pick up @entity6			2
once at the tracking station , @entity6 reached into the tiny hole and packed grease around the failed bearing			2
it worked , and the station was able to successfully complete its communications role in the mission			0
@entity2 splashed down safely the next day			2
at the time , @entity6 did n't think what he was doing was a big deal , and 40 years later , he 's still modest about his role in the mission			1
" that 's all i did , was put my hand in and put grease on it , " he says			0
if he had n't been there , @entity25 would not have been able to make its last communications with the mission before splashdown , but @entity6 says " it was n't life or death , [ from ] my understanding			1
" " my dad explained to me why it was important , " he says , " but it kind of caught me by surprise afterwards , all the attention			0
" ireport.com : @entity6 's firsthand account that attention came from the media and even the astronauts themselves			1
@entity6 's small but important part in @entity2 was a story told by news outlets around the world			1
he even got a nice thank - you note from @entity97 , whom he met when @entity97 went on a tour of @entity25 stations with the other astronauts to thank the staff after the mission			2
" to @entity6 , " reads the note , which @entity97 wrote on a newspaper clipping of @entity6 's story , " with thanks for your help on @entity2			1
" perhaps not surprisingly , like many other kids who grew up during the @entity110 era , @entity6 dreamed of becoming an astronaut			2
he says he remembers visiting his dad 's office to listen to astronauts communicating with @entity25 officials on the ground			0
" we could sit and listen to the actual communication with the astronauts as it was happening , and it was hard to understand , but i loved to do that , " he says			0
" on @entity26 we did n't have good television coverage , so i think i listened to the [ moon ] landing on the radio			0
to me it was a huge thing			0
" @entity6 pursued his dreams of space exploration all the way through college , where he majored in physics			2
unfortunately , he was unable to pass the vision test for the space program because of his colorblindness , but even that could n't squelch his interest			0
@entity6 went on to get his pilot 's license , and even though his career now as a gymnastics school owner is n't exactly space - related , he says that " ever since then , i 've followed the space program			1
" and as a lover of space exploration , @entity6 hopes to see more missions to the moon			0
" i think it would be an important step as far as going further , like to @entity148 , " he says			0
" i would love to see us go back to the moon			0
" but for now , on the 40th anniversary of the moon landing , he can remember the small but crucial role he played in bringing @entity2 home safely			1
" it kind of caught me by surprise , " he says , " but i 'm real proud to have been even a little tiny part of it			0

@entity6 , then age 10 , fixed an antenna important to the mission
he had arms small enough to reach *inside* the antenna
his last - minute repair helped @entity2 's safe splashdown
