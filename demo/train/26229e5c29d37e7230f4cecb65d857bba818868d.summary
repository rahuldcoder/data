@entity0 -- @entity2 has posted its narrowest trade deficit for nine months , helped by a big rise in the value of shipments to the @entity7 , which has toppled @entity8 as @entity2 's number one export destination			1
provisional figures released on thursday by @entity2 's finance ministry showed that overall exports rose 1.1 per cent in march from a year earlier to @entity13 ( $ 64bn ) , while imports -- boosted by fuel to replace idled nuclear capacity -- were up 5.5 per cent to @entity17			2
the resulting @entity19 deficit was the smallest since a small surplus recorded last june , on an unadjusted basis			0
figures for the full fiscal year to the end of march , also published on thursday , showed that @entity2 's exports to @entity8 fell 9 per cent to @entity26 , while exports to the @entity7 rose 10 per cent to @entity28			1
the data suggest @entity2 's revival under a new prime minister will rely more on the outlook in the @entity7 than in @entity8 , which helped @entity2 's export - dependent economy through the difficult @entity35 period			1
trade between @entity38 's two largest economies has been knocked by the slowdown in @entity8 and also by the effects of a diplomatic dispute between @entity0 and @entity42 over a chain of islands in the @entity45			0
meanwhile , data for march showed a revival in big - ticket orders from the @entity7			0
shipments of transport equipment and machinery accounted for 2.1 and 3.3 percentage points of the 7 per cent year - on - year increase , respectively			0
the @entity7 surrendered its position as @entity2 's top destination for exports early in 2009 , following @entity8 's aggressive fiscal stimulus amid the global financial crisis			1
monthly shipments to the @entity7 have exceeded those to @entity8 since then , but mainly during january and february , when trade patterns are distorted by @entity63 holidays in @entity8			0
@entity2 's overall trade deficit stood at @entity65 for the fiscal year ended in march , the widest since records began			1
the nation 's trade balance slipped into deficit in march 2011 , following the huge earthquake that ruptured supply chains and triggered the closure of almost all of @entity2 's nuclear reactors			2
the @entity79 deficit recorded in march , on a seasonally - adjusted basis , was the 25th in a row since then			0

@entity7 *demand* *shrinks* @entity2 trade deficit to narrowest in nine months
@entity2 's march deficit was @entity19 , or about us $ 3.7bn
@entity7 topples @entity8 as number one export destination
