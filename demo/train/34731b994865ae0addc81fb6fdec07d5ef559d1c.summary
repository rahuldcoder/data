-- a @entity2 presidential commission has uncovered more details regarding human experiments conducted by @entity2 researchers in @entity6 in the 1940s in which the subjects were exposed to sexually transmitted diseases			1
the research reaffirms much of what is already publicly known : that between 1946 and 1948 , @entity2 researchers intentionally infected non-consenting subjects in @entity6 with @entity14 , in what the commission called a " clearly unethical historical injustice			1
" the @entity2 has apologized for the incident , and the government has been sued by some of the victims and their heirs			0
president @entity23 asked the @entity24 to uncover details of the research and to assure him that current rules protect people from unethical treatment			1
the commission on monday said it had completed the first of those tasks , and will present its findings to @entity23 in september			1
" it is important that we accurately document this clearly unethical historical injustice			0
we do this to honor the victims , " said commission chair @entity37			2
" in addition , we must look to and learn from the past so that we can assure the public that scientific and medical research today is conducted in an ethical manner			0
research with human subjects is a sacred trust			2
without public confidence , participation will decline and critical research will be stopped			0
it is imperative that we get this right			0
" the scientific investigation , called the @entity54 of 1946 - 1948 , was conducted to determine the effectiveness of penicillin in treating or preventing syphilis after subjects were exposed to the disease			1
gonorrhea and chancres were also studied			0
@entity62 was a relatively new drug at the time			0
the tests were carried out on female commercial sex workers , prisoners in the national penitentiary , patients in the national mental hospital and soldiers			0
according to the study , more than 1,600 people were infected : 696 with syphilis , 772 with gonorrhea and 142 with chancres			0
the presidential commission reviewed more than 125,000 original documents collected from public and private archives around the country and completed a fact - finding trip to @entity6			1
the commission compared its findings in the @entity6 research with similar research that involved intentionally exposing inmates in @entity84 , @entity85 , to gonorrhea in 1943			1
among the commission 's findings was that many of the same researchers in @entity84 were also involved in the @entity6 research			1
" the key difference between the two research projects was that in @entity84 the prisoners were fully briefed , volunteered and gave informed consent , " the commission said in a statement			2
" a few years later , the subjects of the same researchers in @entity6 gave no consent			1
" the @entity6 research has also been compared to the @entity100 syphilis experiment in @entity101			1
during the 40 - year study that began in 1932 , doctors observed how the disease progressed in about 400 poor african - americans who already had the disease			0
the men were never told they had syphilis and were never treated for it			0
the test subjects received free medical testing , meals and burial insurance			2
after the @entity100 study came to light , the @entity2 government reached a $ 10 million out - of - court settlement with surviving study subjects and the families of those who had died in the course of the experiment .			2
