-- with their billowing sails , towering masts and long wooden hulls , 19th century clipper ships were staggering feats of design -- and @entity8 's lifeline to the world 's most exotic goods			1
@entity13 with spices , teas and chocolates from across the globe , the use of these wind - powered sailing vessels reached its peak during the late 1800 's , a period often referred to as the " @entity19			1
" abandoned in the advent of steamboats , the centuries - old transport is now enjoying a revival among cargo traders , with a new breed of merchant ships returning to wind power in an effort to promote environmentally sustainable trade			1
this week , the 32 - meter brigantine @entity31 set sail from the @entity33 to the @entity34 in an eight - month voyage transporting ale , wine , rum and chocolate -- much the same way as merchant ships would have done 150 years ago			1
named in honor of the three friends who founded the ambitious scheme , the 35 - ton carbon - neutral vessel has no motor and relies on solar - powered fridges to keep its cargo cool			1
" a lot of shipping companies are going bankrupt because fuel is so expensive , " said one of the ship 's founders and co-captain , @entity51			1
" the model we have now of shipping is unsustainable -- both for business and the environment			0
we chose a traditional rig because it 's a beautiful design and we wanted to show people sailing can still be effective			1
" from its base in @entity66 in the @entity33 , @entity63 will head to @entity67 in @entity68 where it will pick up 100,000 bottles of ale , delivering them to @entity72 in @entity73			1
from there it will sail to ports across @entity8 and the @entity34 , transporting 500 liters of wine , 50,000 chocolate bars , 4,000 bottles of rum and 5 - tons of cocoa beans in a round trip			1
all the cargo is organic , making it eco-friendly from the moment it is produced to the moment it lands on the supermarket shelf , @entity84 explained			2
" the whole chain of production is sustainable , " he said			2
" for companies , it makes their goods unique			1
it 's a little more expensive but people are willing to pay because it has no carbon footprint			0
" the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) , a green travel campaign group , is now looking to create a sustainable transport certificate , much like the " @entity102 " and " @entity103 " stamps found on other foods			1
@entity99 founder @entity106 predicts that wind - powered cargo ships will soon be the norm as the world 's fossil fuel supplies continue to diminish			1
" the accelerating rate of change in the economy and finance , the peak oil factor and the climate crisis are all tipping factors			0
if more people sense this soon , you could see a jump in sail transport investment , " he said			0
" many smaller older cargo vessels are idle today and are also being recycled -- these are realistic candidates for conversion to sail			0
" recent figures show there is much at stake when it comes to sustainable transport on the high - seas			2
around 90 % of world trade is currently carried by the shipping industry , according to the @entity135			0
the industry contributes 4 % of global carbon emissions , @entity137 figures show			0
indeed , it says that if shipping were a country , it would be the sixth - largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world			2
but it could be that the winds of change are on the horizon			0
from january next year , new @entity135 regulations will require shipping companies to cut emissions by 20 % over the next seven years and a further 50 % by 2050			0
" by 2025 all new ships have to be 20 % more efficient , so shipyards will also be compelled to produce more fuel - efficient vessels , " @entity154 of the @entity155 said			2
" what 's also important is that fuel costs have risen 400 % since 2000 -- the operating costs are huge			0
in any case , every shipping company wants to reduce its emissions			0
" with these environmental concerns in mind , @entity84 and his fellow @entity33 captains @entity165 and @entity167 set about building the @entity63 in 2007 , using the hull of a former passenger ferry in the @entity172 off the coast of @entity174			2
completed in 2009 , this is @entity176 's fourth trade trip after previous voyages across western @entity8 , the @entity34 and even delivering relief aid to @entity179 after the 2010 earthquake			1
the trio are certainly not alone in their quest to find green alternatives to the gas - guzzling cargo vessels of the 21st century			1
@entity188 wind power company @entity186 recently tested a model of its planned 100 - meter , 3,000 - ton carbon - neutral freighter			2
the ship would use 60 % wind power , relying on three computer - operated masts rising 55 - meters -- as tall as a 14 - storey building			1
this would be supplemented by a bio-gas engine converting food waste into methane ; the food waste being anything from restaurant slops to out - of - date sandwiches			0
@entity186 co-director @entity203 said the design would best suit smaller vessels , and they are now looking for between $ 30 million and $ 45 million in funding to get it off the ground			0
" in the last 100 years we 've been absolutely besotted with what oil can do for us , " she said			0
" now we 're running out of fuel and we have to be a little bit cleverer about how we deploy our ships			0
" she admits it will be a challenge changing the traditionally conservative shipping industry , but added : " if we 're looking at a new , green , industrial revolution , those early movers will benefit from being there at the outset			0
" as @entity222 der @entity51 said when the @entity31 crew first floated the idea of a engine-less cargo ship : " everybody thought it was crazy but we 've proved them wrong			1
" it 's so satisfying -- it 's part of our goal to make a transport revolution			2

@entity8 merchant ships of the @entity234 were a lifeline to world 's exotic goods
" @entity19 of @entity242 " makes a comeback with modern - day wind powered cargo ships
sailing ship @entity31 leaves from @entity33 to @entity34 on eight - month voyage
part of 21st century *bid* for environmentally sustainable travel
