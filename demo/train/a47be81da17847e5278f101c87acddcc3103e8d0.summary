@entity0 , @entity2 @entity0 feels haunted by those who are still alive in it , trapped in limbo			1
it is a place so inhumane that the noise of coalition warplanes above is of strange comfort to those there			2
the destruction so near complete , the fight is more now for victory alone , not for its spoils			2
one salient fact stands out : they have given up on hospitals inside the city			1
yes , the lightly wounded are treated by the handful of doctors who remain , but since a huge car bomb near the official border crossing with @entity25 obliterated their main hospital , they send the injured straight to the border			2
another hospital would just be another possible target for @entity30			1
in the past the @entity31 battling the militant islamists for control of the border city have claimed as many as 10,000 civilians remain inside			1
during our two days there we saw little to justify that large a figure			2
there are civilians here , but they eke out a life in the rubble , seeking food and fuel as winter looms , and likely number in the low thousands			1
there are civilians here who refuse to flee or can not			1
@entity25 has closed the western crossing point through which many refugees left -- indeed many stand there now , trying to get out , looking at the @entity25 soldiers to help			2
those inside , however , are besieged increasingly by @entity30 from all fronts			1
nothing can protect them from the indiscriminate , constant shelling			1
@entity30 forces routinely use homemade mortars : gas canisters packed with shreds of scrap metal			1
they rain down on the @entity66 civilian areas , where fighters also mix. @entity69 options in @entity2 shrivel as @entity72 , @entity71 forces make gains @entity74 , who is 12 , lists the friends who have left @entity0			1
he also shows us what they do to protect themselves when the blasts begin			1
there is no shelter , just a room in their house where their uncle told them to run			0
they show us the cushions they use to hide			1
some line the walls , others they put on top of them			0
were this a game , it would not have any rules			0
@entity100 is 60 years old and a week earlier lost one of his six daughters			0
she was 7 years old			0
he walks us to the spot where the mortar hit her			0
" three to four mortars fell near us			0
the first mortar we escaped from			0
the second mortar we escaped from			0
the third fell on us			0
" he is interrupted by the thud of another mortar landing some streets away			0
" my daughter was 7 years old ; 7 years old -- and she died			0
" they could not flee ; the 150 sheep he tends are their livelihood , as is the family car they did not want to abandon			0
the animals stand helpless , too , near the spot where @entity100 's daughter died			0
@entity100 and his family moved here when @entity30 attacked their village , 15 kilometers from @entity0			1
@entity100 must live with these decisions			0
the day before , he sat at his daughter 's grave for a half - hour			0
" she was 7 years old			0
people who saw her felt the need to lift her up and down in play			1
" the graveyard on the city 's outskirts also is a somber scene			1
it , too , is makeshift			2
rubble -- bits of cinder block -- are used as headstones			2
next to the fresh graves lies a long trench -- ready for the next wave of dead			0
it , too , is the scene of children playing , clambering around the trench			2
the conflict 's brutality may be beyond their reach , but the fight for @entity0 will decide what kind of life they could be left with if they survive			1
