-- today millions of people will go to the polls to vote in state and local elections			1
as they cast their ballot , they cast a vote for the most treasured aspect of our democracy			1
the voting booth is the one place where we are all equal -- all @entity15 are able to have an equal voice in determining the shape of our government			2
that sacred right is now under the largest assault we have witnessed in more than a century			2
through a spate of restrictive laws passed in @entity28 - led state legislatures , a disproportionate number of african - americans , latinos , people with disabilities , the elderly and the young will find voting difficult and in many cases impossible			1
these laws require a state photo id to vote , limit early voting , place strict requirements on voter registration and deny voting rights to @entity15 with criminal records who have paid their debt to society			1
@entity40 of @entity41 was born at home in 1926 , during a time of strict segregation when most hospitals did not take in african - americans			0
because @entity47 does not have an official birth certificate , he was denied the free state photo id and told it would cost $ 150 to get the underlying document to obtain one			2
it is , in essence , a modern day poll tax used decades ago to deny blacks in the @entity41 their right to vote			1
unlike @entity47 , who is not a wealthy man , most @entity15 will not have to pay more than $ 100 to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed right			0
his voice could be silenced			0
the states where restrictive laws have already passed represent 63 % of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency			1
a new documentary from @entity67 reveals strong partisan backing of these laws			2
under the pretense of safeguarding elections against voter fraud , the @entity70 , a conservative advocacy group that receives funding from the billionaire @entity72 ( who also back the tea party ) , crafted and distributed model voter @entity79 legislation introduced in more than 30 states this year			1
but widespread voter fraud is a myth			1
a report from the @entity85 says strict @entity79 verification requirements " address a sort of voter fraud more rare than death by lightning			1
" an extensive analysis of data from all 50 states by the @entity93 found that incidents of voter fraud are exceedingly rare			1
these laws harm our democracy			2
more than 21 million @entity15 do not have access to the requisite @entity79			0
the @entity99 found that 25 % of voting age african - americans ; 15 % of those earning less than $ 35,000 ; 18 % of citizens age 65 or older , and 20 % of voters age 18 to 29 do not have the requisite @entity79			2
in @entity106 , according to the @entity105 , 600,000 registered voters have no driver 's license or state - issued identification			0
in @entity113 , more than half of african - americans and @entity112 lack the required @entity79			0
students in @entity106 , @entity113 and @entity41 can no longer use their college identification to vote			2
in @entity117 , which has never required anyone over age 60 to have a photo on their driver 's license , more than 126,000 seniors now face an almost insurmountable hurdle to the polls			0
it will be significantly harder for more than 5 million eligible @entity15 voters in the states with restrictive laws to cast ballots in 2012 -- a number larger than the margin of victory in two of the last three presidential elections			1
it will also cost states money			0
@entity99 's report " what 's wrong with @entity139 " reveals that it is expensive			0
taxpayers will bear the cost of providing free ids , estimated at more than $ 20 million in @entity144 , for example , during a time of tough budget constraints			0
while a diligent effort by citizens groups compelled governors to veto photo id laws in @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity144 and @entity156 and civil rights groups are urging the @entity93 to deny approval of laws passed in @entity41 , @entity160 and @entity106 under the @entity161 , many states will reintroduce the legislation next year , just in time for the 2012 elections			1
the rev. @entity164 led a march in 1963 for jobs and freedom linking the two pillars of @entity15 's promise : economic and political democracy			0
now , the @entity172 movement has shone a spotlight on economic injustice			0
we must also occupy the vote and not allow the same corporate interests that are contributing to economic dislocation for millions of @entity15 to silence citizen 's voices in the voting booth			1
the sacred covenant of our democracy is that on @entity184 , all @entity15 have an equal say in shaping their government			0
we can not let that right be taken away			0
the very soul of our nation 's character depends on it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			1

@entity195 : the right to vote is under assault with new restrictions
@entity193 : states require photo ids , limit early voting , *ban* people with criminal records
these laws mostly affect blacks , latinos , the disabled , the old and the young , she says
these laws are meant to *prevent* voter fraud , she writes , but fraud is exceedingly rare
