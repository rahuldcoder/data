imagine : you are sitting with friends , one day in the distant future , in a space - age house , while robot servants cook dinner , fold laundry and mow the lawn			2
inevitably the question arises : " what was your first robot ? " for many -- 10 million , in fact -- the answer will be @entity13			1
the mini vacuum cleaning robot , launched in 2002 , has become an everyday fixture in homes across the world -- earning pet - names from affectionate owners and a unique place among the internet 's viral cat videos			1
@entity23 , who co-founded manufacturers @entity24 in 1990 with fellow @entity26 alums @entity27 and @entity28 , hails @entity13 as " the world 's first practical home robot			1
" the company is now hoping to infiltrate the boardroom with its wandering " @entity34 " telepresence robot , and the battlefield with its line of defense machines			0
@entity23 sat down with @entity39 's @entity38 to talk about making the sci - fi world of robots a reality			1
@entity39 : what got you into robotics ? @entity23 : i had grown up with @entity48 concepts of robots , and the labs that dr @entity27 and i worked in were focused on trying to make it real			1
in fact , our first business model was to send a robot to the moon and sell the movie rights			2
we actually got quite far			0
it did n't ultimately succeed but it did get us going , and the @entity60 rovers were impacted by the work we 'd done			0
it was very cool but not a great business			0
how did you go against the movies ' concepts of robots ? @entity48 likes to imagine robots as mechanical copies of ourselves -- which is a terrible idea			1
what did everyone think robot vacuuming was going to be ? well , they think rosie the robot from " @entity77 , " a human robot that pushed a vacuum			0
that was never going to happen			0
we know that robot vacuuming was top - of - mind in how robots were going to help our lives			2
our challenge was that we knew how to make the intelligence inexpensive -- but we did n't know how to vacuum			2
how did you learn to make @entity13 ? we entered the toy industry : we partnered with @entity91 building robot baby dolls and robot dinosaurs			1
they taught us how to manufacture very complicated electric mechanical things at a low price			0
we partnered with @entity96 , the guys that make the industrial cleaning machines , and we built giant robot cleaning machines			0
we were also building robots for the @entity101 to clear minefields			1
using that intelligence technology actually gave us the algorithms which @entity13 uses to make sure [ your home ] is thoroughly vacuumed			2
how did you name your machine ? naming is something not necessarily best left to an engineering organization			0
we had a contest inside @entity24 to figure out what we should name the robot and the best we brilliant engineers could come up with was the " @entity116			2
" what 's the future ? if you think about what robots are supposed to do in our future , we 're just about half of the way there			1
they can vacuum , they can scrub your floors -- but what about my laundry ? what about all these other things that robots are supposed to do ? what 's the next big need ? well , i think it has to do with extending independent living : allowing our ageing demographic to live independently in their homes for longer			1
what will the robot home of the future look like ? you may have a menagerie of robots that move around and do things : you may want a robot to bring you a beverage			1
you 're not going to talk to your vacuum cleaning robot : in fact you may never see your vacuum cleaning robot because ideally you come home every day and your floors are freshly vacuumed			0
you may have this robot whose mission in life is to interact with you : it can be a security guard , it can be a robot that a doctor could beam - in and control ... [ to ] see your daughter who has scraped her knee			0
there 's this human interface robot which ultimately will be at the epicenter of this robot enabled home			0
watch the video above for more from @entity23 about @entity24 .			1

roomba *creators* @entity24 *reveal* how they learned from robotic *experiments*
the algorithm that powers @entity13 's movements was developed for clearing minefields
co-founder @entity23 says @entity24 *originally* *planned* to go to the moon
the future : a " menagerie of robots " -- some friendly , some *invisible* ...
