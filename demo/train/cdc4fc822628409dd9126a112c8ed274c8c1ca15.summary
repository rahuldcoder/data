editor 's note : @entity2 is senior lecturer in economics at @entity4 economist @entity2 says the stimulus guideline should be -- first , do no harm			1
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- when libertarians question the merit of president @entity14 's stimulus package , a frequent rejoinder is , " well , we have to do something			2
" this is hardly a persuasive response			0
if the cure is worse than the disease , it is better to live with the disease			0
in any case , libertarians do not argue for doing nothing ; rather , they advocate eliminating or adjusting policies that are bad for the economy independent of the recession			0
here is a stimulus package that libertarians can endorse : repeal the @entity30 : repeal would spur investment , improve the transparency of corporate accounting , slash compliance costs , and avoid the distortions caused by the special - interest provisions in the tax code			1
repeal can work fast , by raising companies ' share prices , increasing cash flow , and allowing corporations to lessen their need for bank lending			2
thus repeal provides short - run stimulus and enhances long - run efficiency			1
recent estimates suggest that tax cuts are at least as effective as spending increases in raising gdp			2
the adverse impact on the deficit is likely to be less than the $ 300 - $ 350 billion in revenue the corporate tax takes in per year , since repeal spurs growth and therefore the revenue from other taxes			1
increase carbon taxes while lowering @entity62 : reasonable people disagree about how much the @entity64 should reduce its use of fossil fuels , but crowded highways , air pollution , and global warming all suggest that some reduction is desirable			1
the effective way to accomplish this is higher gasoline or other carbon taxes , not the messy , complicated green spending in the @entity14 plan that will morph into pork in many cases			2
if higher carbon taxes are combined with lower marginal tax rates , the private sector faces better incentives on both counts			2
this approach avoids the higher deficits implied by @entity14 's green initiatives			0
moderate the growth of entitlements : the elephant in the room amidst the stimulus debate is the impending imbalance in @entity93 and @entity94 as the baby boom generation moves into retirement			1
without reductions in benefits , taxes will have to increase substantially , generating a major drag on the @entity64 economy			1
a reasonable response is to raise the age of eligibility for @entity93 and @entity94 , consistent with the increases in life expectancy and health that have occurred in past decades			1
this restructuring would reassure markets about the @entity64 's long - run fiscal balance			1
this means foreigners will continue to be willing to hold @entity64 debt , so @entity64 borrowing costs will remain moderate			1
eliminate wasteful spending : most discussion of the stimulus focuses on areas where , according to proponents , government spending should be higher			1
much current expenditure , however , is wasteful			0
examples include agricultural subsidies , bloated transportation projects like the @entity125 in @entity126 , misguided infrastructure projects like the @entity129 levees ( why encourage people to live below sea level ? ) , ineffective weapons systems , pork barrel spending , and subsidies for @entity135 and the @entity136 ( buses are more efficient than railways , and @entity139 is more efficient than the @entity136 )			0
everyone knows the @entity64 's long - run deficit picture is dismal			1
we should address this by cutting inefficient spending now			0
withdraw from @entity145 and @entity146 : president @entity14 plans to withdraw @entity64 forces from @entity145 over the next eighteen months , while expanding @entity64 involvement in @entity146			1
it is hard to see , however , that any good arises from dragging out our @entity145 exit or from staying in @entity146			0
the government should move toward faster withdrawal , and from both countries			2
the @entity64 can redeploy these troops where useful , or release the resources to civilian uses			1
@entity159 : later this year , @entity160 is likely to vote on the card check bill , a new law that facilitates unionization			0
the law eliminates the presumption of a secret ballot , which means union organizers can pressure employees into accepting representation			0
laws that protect unions are problematic			2
unions raise wages above market levels , increasing unemployment			1
thus the @entity14 administration can signal @entity64 business that it cares about efficiency , not just redistribution of wealth , by opposing the card check bill			1
better yet , it can repeal the @entity182 , which inflates labor costs in federal contracts			2
renew the @entity64 commitment to @entity186 : one crucial danger in the current environment is that the @entity64 and other countries will embrace protectionist policies			1
the @entity64 enacted prohibitive tariffs during the @entity192 , and many trading partners retaliated			1
world trade plummeted , contributing to the economic misery			0
the @entity14 fiscal stimulus risks reviving this insanity , since both the @entity199 and @entity200 bills require that certain stimulus - funded projects use @entity64 equipment and goods			1
the administration should oppose these provisions			0
more generally , president @entity14 and his economic advisors should state -- no , scream -- that @entity64 is unambiguously committed to free trade			1
expand legal immigration : radical changes in immigration policy seem unlikely in the near future , but one specific change is compelling : an increased quota for @entity216 visas , which go to workers with technical skills seeking employment in @entity64 industry			1
the annual quota for such visas was 195,000 as recently as 2000 , but it now stands at only 65,000			0
a major increase in this quota would be a boon to @entity64 scientific and engineering productivity			1
more broadly , expanding immigration is the most effective method the @entity64 has for aiding poor citizens of foreign countries and for influencing repressive governments			2
stop bailing out businesses that took on too much risk : popular opinion blames deregulation and private sector greed for the financial meltdown , but the reality is more subtle			0
existing regulation was ineffective at preventing excessive risk - taking , and the private sector did its best to profit from the incentives that were in place			0
the extreme increase in risk - taking , however , would not have occurred absent policies that encouraged such risk ( e.g. , @entity247 or the @entity248 's reassurances about housing bubbles ) or past bailouts that cushioned the losses from private risk - taking			0
one crucial response to any crisis is learning to avoid the next one			0
the lesson this time is that rewarding risk generates more risk			0
the @entity64 should therefore stop bailing out banks , automakers , homeowners , or anyone else			2
the libertarian view , then , is that many desirable policy changes involve less government , not more			0
even changes that are inconsistent with the keynesian stimulus framework , such as reductions in military spending , make sense when the spending is wasteful			2
it is tempting to believe that every problem has a solution , but the reality is not so nice			0
it is possible , even likely , that the best we can do is fix things we know how to fix , and then get out of the way			0
this may not ameliorate the current situation , but it avoids making things worse			0
in economics as in medicine -- first , do no harm			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : key rule of stimulus plan should be : first , do no harm
he says plan should repeal the corporate income tax , raise retirement age
@entity2 says " *buy* @entity64 " rules should be avoided and free trade backed
@entity2 : government should *n't* make it easier for unions to organize
