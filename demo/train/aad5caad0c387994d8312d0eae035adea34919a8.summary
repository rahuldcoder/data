-- can anyone out there tell me how many times during this presidential election cycle the term " double - down " has been used ? my old - school hash mark technique is thoroughly inadequate to keep up with the count			1
it seems that not a day goes by without my hearing or reading , sometimes multiple times , the term " double - down			1
" one side or the other side makes a crazy statement and we wait for an " apology , " for someone to say i did not have all the information or i made a mistake or i should never have said that			2
do we get it ? we get doubling - down			1
we get @entity27 and @entity28 surrogates holding firm and " doubling - down " on factually flawed statements about the tragedy in @entity32			1
we get them " doubling down " on bizarre comments about 47 % of @entity35 feeling entitled			1
when i first noticed this term , i thought ok , they are standing firm -- with emphasis			1
it did not seem a bad term , especially when used as a matter of one 's convictions , a confident playing of the hand one has been dealt			1
after all , being flaky or bending with every wind is not a good thing			2
but we are talking about leadership here ! the leadership of a country , of a free people , of a complex , critical and changing world			0
how does " double - down " fit in these contexts ? opinion : the true difference between @entity61 , @entity27 firm , principled and resolute leaders are fine			1
but we also like our leaders to be human -- flaws and all -- self - aware in their imperfections			1
they are more trustworthy that way			0
@entity68 wrote an article late last year for the @entity72 @entity71 website entitled " @entity73 or @entity74			0
" the top 10 in recent times , according to @entity68 , include @entity77 , 1998 ; @entity78 , 1998 ; olympian @entity79 , 2007 ; sen. @entity80 , 2007 ; gov. @entity81 , 2008 ; and @entity82 , 2010 , among others			0
if you are breathing , you should have listened to or heard of one or more of these apologies and know how you reacted to them			0
while you may not agree with the list , you must agree they were pretty famous " please forgive me 's			1
" some were from leaders ; some worked and some did not			2
but they all were an attempt to close the circle on a transgression and regain trust , something we expect of a well - raised child			2
which brings me to what my @entity103 taught me : " when you mess up fess up			0
" tell the truth and tell them before they find out			0
they taught me that punishment would not go away , but would be far less severe if i told the truth about what happened and how or why i veered off the charted course			0
my parents believed in corporal punishment , so i got the message with great clarity			0
from where does this new notion of doubling - down come ? anyone who doubles - down on what everyone knows ( or will soon find out to be ) ill - informed , offensive or untenable positions , is either a fool or believes everyone else is			1
further , what kind of leader molds himself or herself in perfection and cements his or her thinking into antiquity ? a few years ago @entity133 wrote an article for the @entity135 entitled : " @entity136 ? why , when , and how an @entity137			2
" one quote from the piece is most appropriate during this election season : " questions of timing are critical			1
the longer it takes a business leader or a section manager , for example , to acknowledge his or her mistake , the more likely the undecided folks will turn against him or her			1
business leaders need to understand that if , in the end , it is going to be disclosed that they have erred , it 's better to own up as quickly as possible in order to have a hand in making repairs			1
" to acknowledge a mistake is to assert secure leadership ; to take responsibility and prescribe a corrective course of action is wise management			0
taking responsibility for an error earns the privilege of being forgiven , and thus granted a second chance			0
" opinion : how @entity27 really feels about @entity28 here are some other takes on the issue that our politicians might do well to read			1
@entity175 's article for @entity176 entitiled " @entity177 ... they apologize			2
" and for the one - minute manager fans , @entity179 has a segment on @entity182 called " leadership : the @entity184 , " in which he encourages us to become students of apology			2
he says , " learning how to apologize effectively is the real essence of strategic strength			0
" let 's reposition the notion of apology and give it the significance in our political discourse it rightly deserves			2
apology must not become a dirty word			0
the ability to apologize is a sign of leadership strength , not weakness			0
it communicates humility and acknowledges the value of others			0
it is a skill to be studied , an art to be mastered			0
it heals and strengthens individuals , communities and nations			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity216 : this election season , it seems like politicians are *continually* " doubling - down "
she says this term is meant to seem strong , but just *avoids* fessing up
she says we like strong leaders , but want them to be self - aware ; it 's not weak to admit flaws
@entity214 : the longer a leader takes to admit flaw , the more some will turn against them
