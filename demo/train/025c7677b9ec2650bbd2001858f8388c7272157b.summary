-- nearly six months after an explosion aboard an oil rig sent crude spewing from a @entity6 - owned well deep below the @entity7 , cleanup work along the @entity5 is far from over			1
rear adm. @entity8 , federal on - scene coordinator for the @entity11 spill , said wednesday that operations in some areas wo n't stop once winter hits			1
" i envision there will be some areas where cleanup will go on through winter , although there will be others that will close down within a matter of weeks , " @entity8 said			1
shoreline cleanup assessment teams still have yet to analyze 557 miles of oil - affected beaches and declare them clean			0
in the meantime , @entity8 said , oil spill response teams will be in place to clean up any residual oil as necessary			2
" what we have during this spill , this was 87 consecutive days of a major spill , reoccurring , day in and day out			0
during that phase , we were in a crisis			0
now [ crews are ] along the traditional lines , dealing with last release of oil and whether that impacted , time - consuming , labor - intensive process , " he said			0
seafood testing continues to be a priority , according to @entity8			1
@entity44 , a spokeswoman for the @entity45 , said out of more than 2,700 seafood samples that went through rigorous sensory and chemical testing , none have come up positive for the presence of oil or dispersants			2
" no samples have been taken from opened fishing areas that have n't passed those tests , " @entity52 said			0
as for the search for existing oil still within the @entity7 , @entity59 scientist @entity58 said wednesday there is an " aggressive program " of work being conducted both offshore , near - shore and within the water to locate hydrocarbons			1
@entity58 said more than 31,000 samples have been tested and are in the process of being analyzed for evidence of dispersants or oil contamination , and that the results should be released in the next few weeks			0
although it 's been nearly three months since oil has last been released into the @entity7 , @entity8 said the effects of the disaster remain substantial			1
" if you look at what a traditional oil spill has been , you know this is anything but that , " he said			0
" what 's different about this is now we have oil that 's in a very deep water column			0
" @entity8 said even though the highest concentrations of oil detected in the water column is in the parts per billion , the @entity7 seafood industry is suffering from an unfair stigma attached to its product			1
" as i 've said , and will continue to say time and again , it is the most sampled seafood anywhere on the face of the @entity97 , " the rear admiral said			2
" the science , and i 've seen it on a first - hand basis , is thorough , it 's comprehensive , and so those are some of the hardships that the @entity7 residents are trying to recover from right now , especially those who make their livelihood harvesting seafood , and then dealing with the image of that			2

federal officials say work will continue through the winter in some @entity7 areas
officials stress that seafood testing has not turned up any *problems* in fish
