@entity1 gov. @entity0 , a @entity2 hero for pushing austerity measures that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions , rallied supporters monday night , one last push before a recall that 's drawn lots of outside interest and money			1
" we ca n't spike the ball on the 10 - yard line			0
we 've got to take it all the way into the end zone , " @entity0 said in a @entity15 restaurant , within walking distance of the @entity21 ' famed @entity20			1
" because when we do it 's a win not just for us			0
it 's a win for our kids and grandkids to make sure they have a better future than the one we inherited			0
" @entity0 faces @entity30 mayor @entity29 on tuesday in a rematch of the 2010 governor 's race that he won by getting more than 52 % of the vote			1
recall vote is judgment day for @entity1 governor this time , the stakes are higher after a vitriolic campaign that epitomized the political divide across the country			2
the three most recent polls had @entity0 ahead of @entity29 , though the @entity30 mayor 's final tracking poll indicated the tightest of races -- 47.8 % to 47.7 % -- according to his @entity48 page			1
campaign finance filings definitely put @entity0 far ahead , as he 's garnered the lion 's share of the tens of millions of dollars that have come into the campaigns			2
@entity29 told supporters monday that @entity1 voters are tired of @entity0 , whom he described as " a governor who 's more interested in being the rock star of the far right			1
" at a rally outside the @entity60 building , which demonstrators occupied last year to try to block @entity0 's policies , @entity29 supporters sang union songs and waved signs opposing the governor			1
a victory by the first - term governor could give republicans a major boost in efforts to make @entity1 a battleground state in the november presidential election			2
what 's at stake in @entity1 ? president @entity75 easily won the state in 2008 , but @entity0 's unyielding commitment to fiscal austerity in the face of chaotic protests last year made him the poster child for tea party conservatism			1
along with the gubernatorial recall , voters also will decide whether @entity0 's lieutenant governor and four @entity2 state senators keep their jobs			1
does @entity75 's absence portend outcome of @entity1 recall vote ? the recall effort was spurred by a @entity0 - backed law , signed in march 2011 , to limit the collective bargaining rights of state worker unions			1
during a bitter fight over the law last year , @entity97 legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum , and tens of thousands of protesters converged on the @entity60 building in what became an occupation			2
after the law was signed , @entity97 immediately began a recall effort that eventually led to tuesday 's vote			2
the campaign has been fierce , with campaigners complaining of keyed cars , verbal harassment and a general lack of tolerance for differing opinions			0
the @entity114 on monday dispatched federal observers to monitor @entity30 polling places tuesday to ensure no voter discrimination takes place			0
a litany of @entity2 stars have campaigned for @entity0 , including fellow governors @entity121 of @entity123 , @entity124 of @entity125 , @entity126 of @entity127 and @entity128 of @entity129 , as well as @entity131 sen. @entity130 from @entity132			1
@entity133 , a conservative advocacy group built around many of the same principles as the tea party , has pumped more than $ 10 million into @entity1 backing @entity0 's policies			1
" it 's big for the people of @entity1 and their economic future , but i think it 's even bigger nationally as well , " said @entity139 , the group 's president			0
" i think every governor , every state legislator around the country is looking at @entity1 , and they 're going , ok , if i got the courage to stand up and do what i think is right to get my state moving again ... will someone have my back ? and hopefully the answer is going to be , you bet			0
" @entity29 , meanwhile , got his own high - powered support from former president @entity154 , as well as @entity156 chair @entity155 and @entity158 gov. @entity157			1
however , his campaign fundraising has badly trailed the support @entity0 received			1
the @entity161 announced saturday it is spending $ 100,000 in the last five days before the @entity1 recall vote , bringing its investment to $ 300,000			0
in addition , @entity75 never hit the trail for @entity29 , which @entity2 surmised was because the president believes @entity29 will lose			1
on sunday , @entity29 told @entity173 's " @entity172 " that his campaign never asked @entity75 to campaign on his behalf , adding that " we understand he 's got a lot going on			0
" @entity175 press secretary @entity174 acknowledged the uniqueness of the contest , while also stressing there 's no doubt where the president stands			0
" the president 's made clear all along his opposition to those who would take away workers rights -- to actions that would take away or diminish worker 's rights , " @entity174 said			0
" and he 's also made clear his support for @entity29			2
" while tuesday 's vote will culminate a two - year fight over collective bargaining rights for public employee unions , both parties are casting the debate as a larger referendum on the role of government and policies supported by both parties			0
@entity29 , however , has continually framed the race as a state contest instead of a national affair			2
" i want to make sure that everybody understands this is about @entity1 values			0
it 's not about @entity207 it 's about right here , who is going to control the future of this state , " @entity29 said sunday			0
" will it be tea party , the national right wing , or is it going to be the people of the state of @entity1 ? and i 'm putting my money on the people of the state of @entity1			2
" @entity0 has defended his budget actions as necessary for the fiscal health of his state and described his campaign as one of a strong leader who is making the necessary " tough decisions			0

" we 've got to take it all the way , " gov. @entity0 tells backers in @entity15
@entity0 is hailed by @entity2 and vilified by @entity97 for *weakening* public unions
his foe , @entity29 , says @entity0 is trying to be " the rock star of the far right "
outside money has *poured* into @entity1 *due* to the race , most of it in support of @entity0
