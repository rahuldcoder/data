-- millions of @entity1 have been shocked by the devastation caused by the tornadoes in @entity4			1
having toured the area , it 's impossible to put the scope of the damage in words			0
not just homes but entire neighborhoods are gone			0
@entity1 also may have been surprised to hear about a disagreement in @entity13 about delivering disaster aid to victims			1
the good news is this disagreement does n't exist			0
no one in @entity13 is opposing delivering aid to victims			2
in fact , there is no aid bill for @entity4 to even debate			1
the @entity24 has $ 11.6 billion available in the fund for assistance to victims in all federally declared disasters , and this is likely more than sufficient to help victims in @entity4			1
as the ranking member of the @entity33 committee that oversees @entity24 , i 'm confident @entity4 will receive the assistance it needs			1
the bad news is some in the media have persisted in reporting on this nonexistent funding fight -- although it might happen in the future if @entity24 runs out of money			1
my view is that focusing on funding questions now is premature and insensitive			0
although i 've never been shy about telling reporters and my constituents where i stand on tough questions , focusing on a fight that is n't happening is crass and irresponsible journalism			0
instead of reporting the facts about disaster spending , many news outlets have used the tragedy to talk about " dilemmas , " " binds " and " divisions " among @entity53			0
at this point , these stories are only figments in the imaginations of a few journalists and editors who are having a difficult time keeping their opinions to themselves			0
case in point is wednesday 's @entity65 story , where i learned about my alleged dilemma on tornado aid			2
but @entity68 buried the real news in the 15th paragraph , which reads : " at this point , all these questions are theoretical			0
there is no @entity4 disaster relief bill			1
there may never be one			0
... at the moment , the @entity24 has a large stockpile of funds to pay for disaster response ; members of @entity80 estimated it at $ 11.6 billion			1
" the article goes on to say that most legislators agree that the fund is adequate to handle the @entity4 disaster , and it quotes senate majority leader @entity85 as saying " right now , we do n't need the money			1
" in other words , the real news is no @entity4 disaster relief bill exists and , as @entity85 says , " we do n't need the money			1
" still , i have no objection to stating unequivocally that if @entity24 runs out of money , i will encourage my colleagues to pay for any new assistance for @entity4 , or anywhere else by reducing lower - priority spending rather than borrowing new money			1
let me explain why this principle is important			0
under congressional budget rules , if disaster funds are exhausted , @entity80 can pass an " emergency supplemental spending " bill that does not count against that year 's budget caps			1
in other words , @entity80 can simply borrow new money without setting priorities or making hard choices about where to cut the budget elsewhere			2
at a time when we 're losing $ 200 billion a year because of waste and duplication , not setting priorities does n't make sense in any circumstance			2
why respond to one disaster by creating another one for taxpayers ? some have suggested it is hypocritical for me to support disaster aid in my state after opposing the @entity126 emergency aid bill for the @entity127			1
but my position has been the same for my entire service in @entity80 , starting when i pushed for offsets to the @entity131 bombing supplemental bill in 1995			2
my position has never been to oppose all forms of disaster aid			1
my position has been to oppose politicians who use disasters to spend money that has nothing to do with helping victims of disasters			0
the hard truth is both parties have abused the emergency spending process in @entity80 for many years			2
for instance , when the @entity145 was ravaged by @entity146 in 2005 , many in @entity13 were appalled by my suggestion that times of tragedy and disaster are precisely the times for politicians to tighten their belts and make hard choices			0
one of the sacrifices i proposed was to divert funds from a $ 223 million bridge in @entity157 -- known as the " @entity158 " -- to a bridge over @entity160 in @entity161 that was damaged by @entity146			0
my colleagues fumed : how dare i force such choices ? my response was -- and is : how dare we not force such choices ? the @entity126 package , unfortunately , is another recent example			1
i supported a scaled - down $ 25 billion version of disaster aid for @entity126 , but i strongly opposed a $ 50 billion package that was an all - you - can - eat buffet for politicians and politically connected contractors			1
much of the larger @entity126 package had little to do with helping victims of the disaster			1
more than $ 5 billion was directed to the @entity177 -- more than the @entity177 ' annual budget			2
even @entity179 was in on the game			0
@entity179 said its damage from the storm was minimal , but @entity80 wanted to give it $ 15 million anyway			2
the most revealing aspect was more than 70 % of the $ 50 billion would not be spent for two years , which meant it was an economic stimulus package , not a disaster aid bill			1
i do n't believe anyone in the @entity33 wants or anticipates a @entity189 - like fight about emergency spending offsets for @entity4			2
still , if any politicians in @entity13 hope to use @entity4 's tragedy as vehicle for pork , do n't bother			0
state rep. @entity195 from @entity196 , @entity4 , put it best this week on @entity198 : " we do n't want anything			0
we do n't want anything extra			0
we just want to rebuild our city			0
and whatever they can do for us they can cough up , and whatever they do n't , we`ll make it up			0
that`s the way we roll here			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity210 .			1

sen. @entity210 : despite reports , nobody in @entity80 is debating @entity4 disaster aid
@entity210 : @entity24 has $ 11.6 billion for assistance , more than enough to help tornado victims
but if @entity24 fund runs out , @entity210 will stick by policy to deny aid without cuts elsewhere
@entity210 : i opposed @entity126 aid package because it was an " all - you - can - eat buffet "
