president @entity0 talked with @entity2 prime minister @entity1 in a call tuesday night about the threat posed by @entity6 's nuclear program , according to a @entity8 statement			1
@entity0 placed the call to @entity1 , a senior administration official told @entity11			1
the one - paragraph statement from the @entity8 , which referred to the @entity0 - @entity1 discussion as " a part of their ongoing consultations , " followed reports earlier in the day that the @entity8 had rejected a request by @entity1 to meet with @entity0 this month to discuss @entity6 's nuclear program			1
@entity11 's @entity20 , citing @entity2 sources , reported that the @entity2 were told @entity0 's schedule would not permit a meeting even though @entity2 offered to have @entity1 travel to @entity24			2
@entity0 and @entity1 are both due to address the @entity25 in @entity26 in late september but not at the same time			2
the @entity0 administration pushed back later tuesday			1
" contrary to reports in the press , there was never a request for prime minister @entity1 to meet with president @entity0 in @entity24 , nor was a request for a meeting ever denied , " the @entity8 said tuesday night in its statement , which made reference to " our close cooperation on @entity6 and other security issues			1
" @entity1 has shown growing impatience with what he says is a lack of clarity by the @entity0 administration on articulating so - called " red lines " that @entity6 can not cross if it wants to avoid war over its nuclear ambitions			1
the administration has resisted pressure to take that step			0
@entity51 intelligence officials have said they do not believe @entity6 has decided to develop a nuclear weapon , even as evidence continues to mount that they are improving their ability to do so			2
@entity6 said its intentions are peaceful			2
atomic enrichment in and of itself is not the red line , a @entity51 official told @entity11			0
but @entity2 feels a sense of urgency with negotiations aimed at curbing @entity6 's nuclear ambitions failing to produce an agreement and sanctions falling short of their intended effect			2
concerns in @entity24 that @entity2 could launch a pre-emptive strike on @entity6 's nuclear facilities prompted a wave of visits this summer to @entity2 by several top @entity0 administration officials			1
defense secretary @entity73 said that he is confident the @entity51 is capable of monitoring @entity6 and can strike militarily , if necessary			0
" we have pretty good intelligence on them , we keep a close track on them , " @entity73 told @entity81 ' " @entity80 " in an interview aired on tuesday			0
" we think we 've got the ability to be able to strike at them effectively if we have to ... whenever we have to , we have the forces in place , " he said			0
the @entity51 official , who spoke anonymously in order to freely discuss the sensitive issue , said @entity73 is " frustrated " by the partial impact of sanctions , saying he has not seen " the kind of response " that would have been expected from the @entity6 regime , given that the sanctions have been tightened			0
the @entity51 has sanctioned @entity6 banks , companies and individuals as part of an effort by western powers to pressure the @entity101 government			0
@entity1 also said sanctions were only having a partial impact			0
" the sanctions have hurt the @entity6 economy , but they have n't stopped the @entity6 nuclear program			1
that 's a fact , " @entity1 said on tuesday at a news conference in @entity108 .			0
