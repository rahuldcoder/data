one big , presumably bloody finale			0
hundreds of possible ways it could end			1
with " @entity12 " careening toward a climax sunday night , fans of the @entity7 show -- newly anointed by emmy voters as the best drama on tv -- are feverishly doing the plot - resolution math. the internet is buzzing with potential clues , predictions and crazy theories as viewers debate the most fitting way to send teacher - turned - drug - lord @entity20 into the @entity23 sunset			1
which characters will survive ? will @entity25 die , and how ? who is the vial of ricin , and the machine gun in his trunk , meant for ? what will become of wife @entity32 , son @entity25 , sister - in - law @entity33 and -- most pressing of all -- @entity34 , his tormented ex-partner in crime ? @entity37 comments by @entity38 , the show 's creator , have only stoked the speculation			1
" we worked long and hard to ensure that ... the very last episode â € ” would satisfy an audience , " he told @entity41			1
" i am guardedly optimistic that we have achieved just that			0
and furthermore , trying to be as coy as possible , trying to give away as little as possible , i feel like this ending represents on some level , however small , something of a victory for @entity20			0
" read into that what you will			0
and try to be as open - minded as possible when you watch this episode , because it may not indeed feel like a victory			2
" got that ? only @entity38 , his actors and crew know for sure how the show will end its run			1
but that has n't stopped the rest of us from trying to guess			0
here are five theories : hail the returning conqueror this one is the most obvious , and therefore the most unlikely			2
@entity25 shows up at @entity69 's compound , seeking his stolen money , and somehow takes out @entity69 , @entity71 and the rest of the neo-nazi thugs -- either with a surprise hail of bullets or a stealthy dose of poison			2
in the process , he also frees @entity34 , who either is a ) so grateful to be sprung from his hellish existence as a meth - cook slave that he walks away , or b ) so angry that he kills @entity25 right there , extracting a measure of revenge on the " mentor " who ruined his life			0
@entity87 : man of the moment shakespearean tragedy despite its comic moments , " @entity12 " at its heart is an epic tragedy with a high body count			1
in some ways it would be true to the show 's dark heart if things end bleakly for almost everyone : @entity25 's attack on @entity69 goes wrong , he and @entity34 are killed and @entity32 goes to prison or commits suicide , orphaning @entity25 and @entity104 and leaving @entity105 free to go on supplying @entity106 with crystal meth -- @entity25 's last , bitter legacy			1
@entity110 's frenemy some fans of the show think @entity25 got so worked up watching @entity113 and @entity114 -- whose lucrative @entity116 pharmaceutical company may have been rightfully his -- on " @entity117 " at that bar in @entity119 that he 's been jolted into seeking some long - repressed revenge			1
he sure bolted from the bar in a huff			0
but why would he need an automatic weapon to confront a couple of scientists ? besides , such a quest would distract from bigger potential showdowns with other characters			0
photos : memorable scenes from ' @entity12 ' expect the unexpected it would n't be a shocker to see @entity25 survive a showdown with @entity69 and crew , only to be blindsided by another antagonist			1
we 're going to assume that @entity25 -- about the only unsullied character left on the show -- is not going to suddenly break bad and kill his old man			2
but @entity32 has had a lot of time to seethe about how @entity25 destroyed their family and left her facing a prison sentence			0
as we 've seen , @entity105 is not above some ruthless maneuvers to protect her interests			0
and then there 's @entity33 -- poor , grieving @entity33 -- who now hates @entity25 to the core of her widowed soul and may want to avenge @entity152 's death			2
5 questions ' @entity12 ' must answer the " @entity155 " theory sunday 's final episode is titled " @entity155 , " which has sent the internet scurrying to decode its potential meanings			1
one resourceful writer for @entity161 has unearthed a @entity163 song , " @entity165 , " which has a character named @entity155			0
in the song a jealous cowboy kills a rival who was flirting with his love , @entity155 , in a bar			0
the cowboy flees town alone before returning for @entity155 some time later , only to be shot down in a face - off with five unseen men			0
@entity155 , says the writer , is a metaphor for @entity25 's criminal life -- the seductive power he feels when he 's earning respect and millions of dollars			2
then again , " felina " is also an anagram for " finale			0
" so it may just mean @entity38 is messing with us			1
because there 's only one thing we can say for sure about " @entity12 's " last episode : all our predictions will be wrong			1
how do you think " @entity12 " will end ? how should it end ? let us know in the comments .			1

the @entity191 is buzzing with predictions and crazy theories about how " @entity12 " will end
after five years the @entity7 show 's final episode airs sunday night
