how terrible is it to be born a girl in the world today ? the almost daily headlines about another cruel act of violence and discrimination against women -- from the kidnapping of nearly 300 school girls in @entity10 last month , to the latest gruesome stoning of a woman in @entity13 -- provide plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about women 's equality and safety in today 's world			1
the recent case of " misogynist extremism " in @entity21 , where a young man killed six people in " retribution " for all the girls who had rejected him , underscores the fact that all societies suffer from violence against women			1
indeed , the @entity30 estimates that 35 % of women worldwide experience intimate - partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime			1
a new @entity37 report estimates that in some countries , the economic toll of violence against women exceeds a staggering 3 % of gdp			1
also shocking in the 21st century is that the leading cause of death worldwide for girls ages 15 to 19 is complication related to pregnancy and childbirth , in many cases because girls are married and bearing children before their young bodies are ready			1
high rates of child marriage in some countries also limit the educational opportunities and economic independence of girls			2
add in a persistent preference for sons in @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 that has resulted in millions of " missing girls , " and the picture for girls today seems pretty grim			2
but these challenges , as daunting as they are , should not obscure the important gains that women and girls have made in recent decades -- gains that point to a much brighter future			2
first , the global gender gap in education has been shrinking : between 1999 and 2009 , the number of girls out of school dropped from nearly 61 million to 35 million , and equal numbers of girls and boys now complete primary school in @entity82 and @entity83			0
in fact , around the world , women are beginning to outnumber men at the university level -- in some cases by a wide margin			0
women 's political participation worldwide also continues to grow			0
as of july 2013 , 35 countries , including nine in @entity94 , had national parliaments with at least 30 % female representatives and several countries now include quotas to ensure women 's political participation			0
examples of women rising to the top of their fields -- just think of @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and others -- and on their own terms , are increasingly more common			0
the dire statistics we hear today about violence against women have a silver lining -- that violence is being counted -- and quantified -- which is a huge leap forward from centuries of silence and acceptance of the oppression of women			1
honor crimes and sexual violence have long gone unrecorded because such behavior is tolerated , ignored , or conveniently covered up in mostly rural communities			0
survivors often remain silent for fear their attackers will take revenge if they report the crime			0
but national and international media coverage and popular outrage are beginning to shift the dynamic			0
the proliferation of mobile phones and use of social media mean that violence and discrimination against women are increasingly reported			2
in the aftermath of the 2012 gang rape and murder of a 23 - year - old female student in @entity146 , @entity147 , journalists called me asking why are we seeing such an uptick in sexual violence against women now -- is it somehow related to globalization ? my response is that we simply have no data to conclude that the incidence of sexual violence in @entity147 is actually increasing -- reported incidents may be on the rise , but that could be because women , supported by male family members , are finally breaking the code of silence to denounce and prosecute their attackers			1
the outrage in the @entity146 case forced the @entity147 government to strengthen its sexual assault laws -- including making rape in some cases punishable by life in prison or the death penalty and increasing the minimum sentence for gang rape to 20 years			0
as depressing and disturbing as the headlines can be , news of violence , hatred , and discrimination against women is beginning to catalyze powerful change			1
so too is the growing body of evidence that disempowering women poses an enormous economic cost on society			0
there will inevitably be backlash against that change -- backlash that will take the form of deranged extremists from @entity21 to @entity10 to @entity13 -- but the momentum of positive change for women and girls in the world today is undeniable .			1

a woman in @entity13 was stoned to death , nearly 300 girls in @entity10 were kidnapped
@entity202 : despite *progress* , all societies suffer from violence against women
she says but these headlines of hatred against women are starting to catalyze change
@entity214 : that violence is being counted is a step forward from centuries of silence
