@entity0 -- global mean temperatures this year might not have scaled the record - equaling heights of 2010 , but it 's been another tumultuous 12 months			1
according to the @entity6 's ( @entity6 ) provisional status report , issued at the @entity8 climate talks in @entity9 , 2011 was the 10th warmest year on record and warmer than any other year with a @entity12 event			1
@entity12 -- an opposite weather pattern to @entity14 which cools surface waters in the eastern and @entity16 -- occurs two to three times a decade on average , says climatologist and scientific coordinator of the @entity6 statement @entity20			1
this most recent one -- which started in the second half of 2010 and continued until may this year -- has been one of the strongest in the past 60 years , says the @entity6 , and was " closely associated " with many of the regional weather events that have dominated the headlines throughout the year			1
january saw floods in northeast @entity28 -- the worst in @entity30 's capital , @entity31 since 1974 -- and deadly landslides caused by a deluge of rain in @entity35			0
the appalling disaster in a mountainous region around 60 kilometers north of @entity38 claimed at least 900 lives , according to the @entity6 , making it the single most deadly weather event of the year			2
heavy rains also caused many regions of the world to flood in 2011 including parts of southern @entity45 , @entity46 and southern states of @entity48			0
but is was major flooding in @entity50 that dominated the news as the year came to a close , wiping out more than 650 lives in @entity54 , and dozens more in neighboring @entity55 and @entity56			0
rainfall during june to september 's monsoon season in northern and central @entity54 was up to 80 % higher than the seasonal average , says the @entity6			2
the situation came to a head in october as already inundated natural waterways combined with high tides to swamp the @entity54 capital @entity64			0
among the other more notable extremes of weather in 2011 , says @entity20 , were the huge weather disparities experienced in the @entity68 the @entity6 reported 14 separate climate events this year in the @entity68 which they estimate caused losses upwards of $ 1 billion			1
heavy snow fell across southern and @entity73 states -- including @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 in february			0
april and may played host to one of the most active tornado seasons on record , according to the @entity6 , and the @entity81 suffered its worst floods in nearly 80 years			0
but 600 miles west in @entity84 a drought was taking hold and wildfires raged			0
summer temperatures in the @entity84 averaged 30.4 degrees @entity88 ( 86.7 degrees @entity89 ) -- 3 degrees @entity88 ( 5.4 degrees @entity89 ) higher than the long - term average , according to the @entity6 and the highest - ever recorded in any @entity92 state			1
all the while , many northeastern states and parts of southern @entity95 were experiencing their wettest year on record -- the most severe flooding coming in the wake of @entity100 in late august and @entity101 which followed quickly on her heels			1
elsewhere , the @entity104 endured a terrible drought which put up to 12 million people at risk of starvation until october 's rains eased the threat			0
but such was their intensity -- @entity114 , northeast @entity113 received more rain in six weeks ( 402 millimeters ) than the annual average -- it led to crop damage , says the @entity6			2
the general warming trend -- 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the 15 years since 1997 -- was highlighted by summer sea ice melt in the @entity120			1
the @entity6 reported that the seasonal minimum , reached on september 9 , was 35 % below the 1979 - 2000 average and the second - lowest on record with both the @entity123 and @entity68 passages ice free for periods during the summer			1
" our science is solid and it proves unequivocally that the world is warming ... " @entity6 secretary - general @entity128 said on publication of the provisional report			2
human activities are to blame , @entity128 says , and temperatures are " rapidly approaching " a level which scientists believe could kick - start " far - reaching and irreversible " climate change			0
final figures for 2011 's weather will be published by the @entity6 in march next year .			0
