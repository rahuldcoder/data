-- the stakes in a court hearing tuesday were as big as the star performers at the heart of the matter			0
@entity6 appealed to a federal three - judge panel tuesday , asking it to overturn @entity10 safety citations and a ban restricting how humans interact with killer whales during performances			1
@entity10 instituted the regulations after the death of veteran trainer @entity17 in 2010 , when @entity18 , the orca she had worked with for years , dragged her into the water and killed her in front of a horrified audience			1
the governmental agency said the company had violated the general duty clause of the @entity26 , saying it exposed its workers to a known hazard in the workplace			0
@entity30 , son of @entity32 justice @entity31 and former solicitor of the @entity35 @entity34 , argued in the hearing that @entity10 is overstepping its bounds and has no more of a right to impose restrictions on a specialized industry like @entity6 than it does to regulate tackling in the @entity41 or impose speed limits in @entity43			1
filmmaker : why i made ' @entity46 ' the judges peppered both @entity31 and @entity48 , who represented @entity10 and the @entity34 , with numerous questions on that analogy			1
" @entity6 created this business but can not create their own safety standard , " @entity51 said			1
the issue seemed to trouble judge @entity55			0
" it does seem giving the authority ( here ) would give @entity10 the authority over sports and entertainment industries in the @entity35 , " @entity55 told @entity51			2
@entity31 also argued that @entity10 's restrictions present a " fundamental difference " and a " stark change " in the premise of @entity6 's existing business model , which is based on exhibiting humans interacting with killer whales			1
the theme park was known until 2010 for its famous @entity71 shows , which featured amazing demonstrations of trainers surfing on orcas or being catapulted high into the air			0
" @entity10 is n't asking @entity6 to prevent all activities , " @entity51 said			1
" these are feasible reductions that we know @entity6 can do because they 're doing them now			2
" in 2010 , @entity6 was originally fined $ 75,000 for three safety violations , including one " willful " citation			1
after @entity6 appealed that decision , an administrative law judge in 2012 downgraded the " willful " complaint to " serious , " reducing the fine to $ 12,000			2
crucially , that judge sided with @entity10 's mandate to keep humans out of the water with killer whales unless there were physical barriers to reduce the risk of serious injury or death			1
@entity6 disagreed and filed its appeal with the @entity97			2
with the court - ordered restrictions , some argue that @entity6 's very livelihood is on the line			2
" @entity6 offers the public an opportunity to observe humans ' interaction with killer whales , " the company said in court documents			1
" this brings profound public educational benefit , is integral to @entity6 's care of the whales , and responds to an elemental human desire to know , understand , and interact with the natural world			1
" @entity10 argued in a response brief that such close interaction between humans and whales was not crucial to the company 's business			1
" it is clear from @entity6 's adoption of these measures that close contact of the kind that resulted in @entity17 's death is not essential to @entity6 's ability to draw visitors to its parks , to practice behaviors during shows , or to care for its whales , " the brief said			1
captive orcas have killed four people , including three trainers			0
" the ( $ 12,000 citation ) amounts to basically a very expensive speeding ticket , " said @entity136 , a partner with @entity137 who specializes in labor law			0
" the one that 's going to be harder to prove is proving this type of interaction between whales and the trainers actually makes the interactions more predictable , and by reducing that , and creating greater distances , it 's going to undermine not only the level of predictability , but it 's going to harm their ability to care for the animals and impact their operations in a more fundamental way			2
" trainers have been in " close contact with whales since the 1960s , " court documents say			0
" during this time , @entity10 could have opened an investigation at any time if it believed that close contact presented a recognized hazard			2
" @entity136 said the argument is legitimate , but @entity6 faces an uphill battle because what @entity10 has on its side is history			1
" there 's a long and well - documented track record of these types of animals behaving aggressively toward humans to the point that they 've caused a number of fatalities , not only at @entity6 , but at a number of places , " @entity136 said			2
" that is what @entity10 is going to say : ' you absolutely were on notice of this , this is absolutely a recognized hazard			0
' this kind of track record is not one you can ignore			0
so it 's very important ; it 's what @entity10 's case really hinges upon			0
" the appeal hearing , normally held in a courtroom , garnered such high interest that it was held at a public forum at the @entity197			0
the venue was the first time oral arguments for the @entity97 have been heard outside of the court			0
spectators included @entity197 law students , the general public and @entity6 employees			0
a decision is not expected immediately			0
@entity17 's death sparked the making of a documentary acquired by @entity209 called " @entity46			0
" the documentary explores the history of killer whales in captivity and incidents in aquatic parks leading up to @entity17 's death			1
@entity6 answers questions about ' @entity46 '			0
