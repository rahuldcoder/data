-- back in the day , @entity1 enriched the @entity3 language by pumping out neologisms like a maniac			0
fast forward 400 - plus years , and we do n't really have an official bard , per se -- at least not in corporeal form			1
nope , if you want to put your finger on the entity that 's currently shaping and torquing our lexicon like a game of drunken twister , you 're already there : look down at your keyboard , and then at the screen and down at your keyboard again			0
our bard would be the internet , breeding ground of such gems as " @entity24 , " " tweet , " and , sadly , " @entity26 ! ! ! ! ! " some may call the advent of internet - speak the demise of the @entity3 language , and to them we would say , " stfu			1
" last year , " unfriend " was deemed the word of the year by the @entity33			0
so , much like that tattoo of your initials you got emblazoned across your butt last summer after too many @entity41 , this new slang is here to stay			0
besides , @entity1 coined the word " puke , " so it was n't all sunshine and roses back in the 1500s , anyway			0
still , there are some internet terms that do n't quite translate when applied to real - life situations ( or , ok , any situation other than the original and intended one ) , because they 're too obtuse , redundant or just plain stupid			1
here 's our take on three of the most awkward phrases and symbols to go from screen to scene : # ah , the hashtag			2
first introduced into the @entity61 lexicon by @entity62 in 2007 , the hashtag was originally a way to tie together common threads of conversation ( e.g. , follow friday , tweets relating to events , news about natural disasters )			1
now , however , the hashtag has also become a way in which to emphasize certain ideas on the microblogging site ( " this weekend has completely murdered my soul # whiskeyandheartache ) , and , more recently , to denote sarcasm and caustic wit ( " wow , i really enjoyed that show			1
@entity77 art is totally dope			0
more free wine , however , would have made the experience much more tolerable			0
that 's all well and good in the @entity85 , but when taken into the real world , the hashtag is a bit harder to hash out			2
you see , the majority of society -- you know , the people who do n't sit in front of their computers tweeting about how " eating pancakes makes me feel like death now that i 'm 30 # notakidanymore " -- does n't understand what the hell you 're saying when you tack what amounts to a pound sign onto any given sentence / word in your correspondence ( e-mails , etc. )			2
in fact , they could get offended by what you think is an artfully punctuated joke			0
listen , we do not yet have a symbol that translates into sarcasm ( despite lofty efforts by the folks over at @entity114 ) , and the hashtag is no exception			0
so , for now , stick to being caustic and dry , and even then , watch your mouth			0
not everyone is socially fluent enough to recognize superior wit when they see it			0
# @entity80 ' ... @ @entity122 's @entity121 may have added the " @ " sign to its collection in march , but the artfully looping symbol has yet to find any real foothold in the conversational realm			1
look , it makes sense to add an @ to your name on @entity61 , and @entity132 now has a handy tagging feature that works with the addition of that particular keystroke , but referring to your friends as " @entity137 " or " @ @entity138 " in digital parlance such as e-mail or chat is just ... well ... redundant			1
you already said their name , so why do you need a directive ? even more egregious is rattling off your @entity61 handle in any person - to - person situation ( exception : at tech and social media events this rule is a little less hard and fast , given that your @entity61 handle is akin to your phone number )			1
not only does it reek of self - promotion , it 's just weird			2
and take it from us , tech and social - media experts ' behavioral standards should not exactly be your yardstick of appropriateness			2
lol hey , did you know that before " lol " came to mean " laughing out loud , " it was code for " little old lady " in the medical world ? well , unless you 're a doc alerting your compatriots to the arrival of a particularly ornery blue - haired broad , never should you stir your vocal cords to utter the phrase " lol			1
" why ? because you 're not actually laughing			2
the day that @entity161 becomes common parlance , my friends , will be the day that this whole internet @entity1 - penned comedy will become a complete and utter tragedy .			1

some internet terms do not translate when applied to real - life situations
the # has become a way in which to emphasize certain ideas on *twitter*
you can tag a name by adding @ to your name on @entity61 or @entity132
" lol " was code for " little old lady " before it came to mean " laughing out loud "
