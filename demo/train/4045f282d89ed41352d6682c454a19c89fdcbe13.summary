but a covey of conservative @entity3 opponents fueled with super pac money and jazzed by tea party frenzy forced him from the middle and into an increasingly conservative persona , culminating in his somewhat plaintive declaration that he was " severely " conservative			0
with his need to compete for the @entity3 right now ebbing , will @entity4 migrate back to the center , hoping that a good shake of the @entity25 will create a clean slate to start courting moderates and independents ? he can only wish it were that easy			1
there is little doubt that @entity4 , like most presidential candidates before him , will recast his message for a general election			1
his problem in doing so , however , is his well - established record as a political chameleon who changes colors to match the polemics of his strongest political rival			0
in a weird through - the - looking - glass transformation that echoes through @entity4 's political career , @entity46 the candidate often takes on some of the positions and personality traits of his opponents			1
when he challenged @entity50 for the @entity52 seat in 1994 , @entity4 became @entity46 , staking out a painfully sincere middle ground stance on abortion			1
watching him in debate with @entity50 , viewers can be excused for thinking they have wandered into an earlier " @entity58 " skit			0
@entity4 's tortured answer wiggles one way -- he says he will support and defend @entity61 -- then wiggles the other by saying his family , including his mom , had its own beliefs " but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter			1
and you will not see me wavering on that			0
" @entity50 puts it more simply			0
" i support pro-choice , " he says			0
" my opponent is multiple choice			0
" the line drew a burst of applause			0
@entity4 ran a similar campaign for governor in 2002 , modeling the same moderate positions of the two liberal @entity3 governors who preceded him			1
he took the same tortured tack on abortion as in 1994 ; his campaign courted @entity85 , promising , according to members who attended a meeting , to be a supporter of gay rights and to stay out of the gay marriage case making its way through the state courts			2
there was little change in his political stance in the first year of his governorship			0
no social initiatives came out of the governor 's office			1
most of his work revolved around the annual budget process , a @entity104 ritual in which the governor , @entity3 or @entity106 , presents a budget to the @entity110 legislature , which quickly dismantles the plan and replaces it with its own agenda , overriding any eventual veto attempts by the governor			1
then came two events that forced the governor out of his comfort zone of moderation			2
the first was the state 's @entity121 's 2003 ruling that a ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional			0
with his eyes already set on the @entity126 , @entity4 faced the unplanned prospect of running for president as the governor from the first same - sex marriage state in the union			1
fortunately for him , however , he had no real constitutional power to do anything other than to act as a sideline cheerleader for a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed civil unions but not same - sex marriage			0
the amendment eventually failed in the legislature			0
in the meantime , @entity4 did some executive huffing and puffing , summoning up a dusty 1914 miscegenation statute that barred out - of - state couples from marrying in @entity110 if their union was prohibited at home			1
the order was dropped after municipal clerks complained about the extra work it would bring			0
but mostly @entity4 was able to use rhetoric to play to conservatives while taking no action that would offend the liberals			1
perhaps the more significant , and less noted , event that forced @entity4 to switch his protective coloring was the resignation in september 2004 of house speaker @entity158 , a staunch social conservative who ruled the @entity161 with an iron hand			1
a singular power in the legislature , @entity158 controlled all action in the @entity126 , keeping liberal proposals from advancing out of committee			0
with @entity158 as sentinel , @entity4 was spared from making any decisions on legislation that could haunt him in @entity3 primaries			1
@entity158 's departure in advance of federal obstruction of justice charges -- he eventually pleaded guilty -- forced @entity4 to drop his @entity176 persona			1
with a more liberal @entity178 speaker in place , who is now doing time in federal prison , @entity4 had no place to hide as hot - button issues such as stem cell research , the morning - after pill and various bills on sexual orientation rights escaped the legislature and made it onto his desk			1
he faced a turning point			0
sign those bills and safeguard his position for another run for governor or oppose them to curry favor with the more conservative @entity3 voters he would need to win a presidential nomination			2
he chose the latter , beginning his long public transformation to severely conservative @entity46			2
even back then , reporters covering the @entity201 could anticipate carefully crafted statements by @entity4 on any social issue likely to come up when he shared the dais with @entity3 presidential primary rivals			2
his one major legacy as governor -- the health care reform bill for which @entity110 @entity178 now honor him -- was part of that same @entity4 political calculus			1
when he collaborated with the @entity178 leadership to pass the law , the central fixture of individual mandate was within a general @entity3 ideology for reforming health care			0
but @entity4 's dream of being the savior of the health care crisis became a nightmare when conservatives demonized a @entity178 president for the same legislation			1
@entity4 could n't get a break from his @entity110 legacy			1
in the last two years of his governorship , @entity4 was out of state campaigning for president more often than he was in his @entity231 office			2
his campaign patter often included digs at liberal @entity110 , such as the time he described himself as " a vegetarian at a cattle ranch			1
" the tactic did n't increase the love in @entity110			2
in march 2005 , he had a 55 - to - 41 favorable to unfavorable rating			0
those numbers continued to decline over the next two years			0
by november 2006 , as his term was ending , his numbers dropped to 37 - to - 52 favorable to unfavorable			0
only 29 % said they would vote for him again			0
some say @entity4 's shifting persona is nothing new to @entity247 politics			1
even @entity248 tailored his message to the audience or electorate he was trying to woo			0
but the politicians who win elections and leave legacies keep to core ideals			0
@entity4 may have such ideals tucked away in a lockbox , but who can tell ? his often ham - handed attempts to win over whatever demographic he is targeting this week creates a stink of insincerity that trails him even when he actually means what he says			2
that will be the problem for whichever @entity4 we see over the next months			2
whatever message he chooses , part of the audience will wonder if the @entity4 they are seeing will be the same one they might vote for			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity274 .			2

@entity274 : @entity4 courted conservatives ; with nomination in *bag* , what 's next ?
@entity274 : moderate @entity46 has *morphed* into @entity281 over time
@entity274 : as @entity110 governor , he was able to play to both sides for *awhile*
whatever stand he chooses , @entity274 writes , *people* will wonder if it 's the real @entity4
