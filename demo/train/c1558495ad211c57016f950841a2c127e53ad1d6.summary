-- the entryways to some of the @entity4 dorms near the corner of @entity6 and @entity7 resemble the doors of a prison			1
and if you look around , it 's clear that instead of trying to keep trouble locked in , the 123 - year - old private school is trying to keep trouble out			2
the university 's stone wall near that intersection appears to have had graffiti scrubbed off			0
and the @entity19 chose to situate its @entity20 less than a block away			0
there are bright yellow signs on nearby telephone poles with the words " safe passage " on them			0
they arrived last year after a budget crunch caused mayor @entity29 to close 50 city schools , forcing displaced students to walk not only farther from home , but across warring gang territory -- some in this neighborhood -- to attend classes			0
these students , many of whom are black and @entity39 , are supposed to stay on the " safe passage " routes to avoid being accidentally shot by fighting gangs			2
as if bullets can read signs			0
against this backdrop , the university is bidding for president @entity47 's presidential library , with a projected cost approaching half a billion dollars			1
( the deadline for bids is june 16 ; @entity51 , where @entity47 grew up , and @entity52 are also expected to make pitches			1
) and this has presented @entity47 with a political -- and arguably moral -- bind that his former community - activist self might have taken on quite differently			1
some context : @entity29 , @entity47 's friend and former @entity58 chief of staff , is despised by the black community in this town			1
and at least six shootings happened within blocks of @entity47 's @entity64 home this past weekend alone , a situation crying out for solutions and funds to pay for them			1
just to the west of @entity6 and @entity7 , the residents want the university to build a trauma center to help save the lives of the people living in the high crime / low income neighborhoods that surround it			1
currently the university 's renowned hospital is unable to treat adults injured in falls , car accidents and assaults , though it does operate a trauma center for children 16 and under			1
it had a trauma care unit in 1986 but closed it two years later because of annual losses of $ 2 million -- a combination of high volume , patients without insurance and insufficient public aid			2
this mattered , for example , to an 18 - year - old youth activist by the name of @entity96 , who in 2010 was caught in the crossfire of a drive - by shooting just four blocks from the school 's hospital , but had to be driven 10 miles to be treated			2
in 2013 , @entity104 studied gunshot wounds recorded by the @entity106 from 1999 to 2009 and found that living more than five miles from a trauma center decreases chances of survival			1
adults living on the city 's predominantly black south side do not live within five miles of such a center			2
opening a $ 700 million " hospital for the future " -- as the university did last year with its @entity116 , focused on cancer , neuroscience and advanced surgery -- while telling neighbors a trauma center is too expensive to run , is also a problem			1
and it certainly does n't help that @entity29 , the man responsible for closing so many schools in this black neighborhood , is lobbying state officials to pony up $ 100 million for the library			0
no money to educate black children safely near their homes			0
too expensive to run a trauma center to help black victims of shootings			1
but half a billion for a vanity project with the @entity47 name on it			1
with the location of the library set to be named sometime next year , it would appear the president has little choice but to avoid placing the library at the university lest he run the risk of , for one thing , making his @entity149 initiative look hollow			1
it 's either that or try to force the university 's hand -- no adult trauma center , no library			1
@entity155 is looking better and better , is n't it ? this week a local organization , stop , @entity159 , is holding a series of peaceful protests on and around the university campus to oppose putting the library there and to raise attention for the need for a trauma center			1
their demonstrations started with a sit - in on the construction site for a parking ramp near the school 's new @entity173 center			1
video shows it ended with protesters being dragged off the premises by university police for trespassing , with some protesters injured in the process			0
" the @entity4 upholds the right to peaceful and safe demonstrations , but can not allow protests that jeopardize anyone 's safety , " a statement read , adding it has established locations for demonstrations			2
" no arrests were made , and no charges have been planned			0
" and no resolution in the near future			0
" if the @entity195 cared about the safety of black kids , they would provide a trauma center , because right now in @entity201 black kids are the leading population that are suffering from trauma , " said demonstrator @entity199 , while holding an icepack on a wrist she said was injured in the skirmish			1
next to her was 18 - year - old @entity208 , whose leg was elevated on a desk , her ankle in an air cast			0
@entity159 's office is on @entity6 , just a few blocks west of the school			0
" @entity47 has made it a point in his administration to not only preserve the life of black people , but black men , " @entity216 said			2
" and the university can play a part and they 're just choosing not to			0
" she said " there 's a lot of burden " on @entity47 to push for a trauma center			1
" clearly they 're not listening to us			0
clearly they 're just going to keep pushing us around ... keep harming us until we go away			0
and we 're not going away			0
but we are getting tired and we do need help from people the university will listen to			0
and they will listen to ( @entity47 )			2
so in some respect he does owe us some attention			0
" when more than 40 people are being shot in a weekend -- some in and around that neighborhood -- as happened last month , a lot more than attention is needed			0
which could make @entity47 's return to @entity201 every bit as stressful and as political as any day in @entity246 .			2

@entity248 : violent area around @entity4 is near where pricey @entity47 library might go
@entity248 : area needs adult trauma center , cuts forced school closings ; funding needed here
he says @entity47 , the community organizer , might have pointed this out and is in *tricky* spot
@entity248 : @entity47 should avoid putting library there , or push for trauma center as a *condition*
