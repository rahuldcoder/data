-- a second half goal from @entity2 gave @entity3 to a 1 - 0 victory over an understrength @entity5 in a prestige friendly international in @entity8 on saturday			1
the slender margin of defeat flattered @entity5 , with @entity11 missing a penalty shortly after the breakthrough goal and @entity3 captain @entity14 crashing a shot against the post			1
in uncomfortable heat in the @entity19 capital , @entity3 always had the edge against and @entity5 team missing @entity22 , his defensive partners @entity23 and @entity25 and midfield stars @entity26 and @entity28			1
@entity29 was handed the captaincy armband by @entity31 and gave a wholehearted performance , nearly giving his side the lead in the opening moments as he just failed to get a touch on an inviting cross by @entity38			0
but there were few other attacking moments for @entity5 in the first half and their goal was twice threatened as stand - in central defender @entity43 twice lost possession in dangerous positions			1
a shot screwed wide by @entity47 and @entity2 's failure to find a teammate with his cross left his mistakes unpunished			2
@entity5 goalkeeper @entity52 was also forced to make saves from @entity54 and the influential @entity55			2
@entity31 would have been happy to see his makeshift men go into the break still level but the effort was undone in the 46th minute as @entity61 's clever cross underlined poor marking and @entity2 stepped in to head past @entity52			1
@entity5 should have fallen two behind after @entity65 's mistake left @entity66 and he was brought down by his @entity68 teammate @entity52			2
he was lucky to escape a red card but then watched as @entity11 made a woeful hash of the penalty			0
@entity72 had a half - chance at the far post from another @entity38 before @entity14 found space to thump a shot which beat @entity52 and crashed against the post			0
@entity5 at least pressed in the closing stages but could not forge a clear chance against the five - time @entity80 winners			2
@entity31 attempted to put a brave face on a lackluster display by his men			0
" i think we played against a @entity3 team who have the best xi in the world , " he told @entity84			0
" my first xi will be better than this one			0
but i found a lot of things positive			0

@entity94 took the lead in the 16th minute after @entity97 goalkeeper @entity108 saved @entity110 's angled shot only for @entity103 to capitalize on the rebound			1
@entity112 equalized with a penalty just after the hour mark after @entity115 had been fouled			0
but @entity116 handled in his own penalty area with four minutes left and @entity103 netted the winner			0
another prestige friendly saw @entity80 title holders @entity120 and the @entity122 draw 0 - 0 in @entity123 in a game of few chances			1
