a @entity1 company says it has made the first metal gun using a 3 - d printer , taking the debate over people 's emerging ability to create their own firearms to a new level			1
solid concepts , a specialty manufacturing company , said in a blog post it has fired more than 50 rounds from the handgun , even hitting a few bull 's - eyes at more than 30 yards			1
the pistol is a version of an @entity17 , a handgun designed by @entity19 and first used widely in the latter stages of combat stemming from the @entity22			0
it 's built from 33 mostly stainless - steel parts and has a carbon - fiber handgrip carved with a laser			0
" @entity30 - printed metal gun proves that 3 - d printing is n't just making trinkets and @entity34 heads , " the company said in the blog post			1
@entity9 went out of its way friday to point out that producing the metal gun is n't meant to advance a trend that worries law enforcement and some politicians			0
as 3 - d printers become more widespread and affordable , some envision a near future in which criminals can crank out untraceable weapons without having to leave their homes			1
" let me start out by saying one , very important thing : this is not about desktop 3 - d printers , " @entity48 , a spokeswoman for the company , wrote in the blog post			1
the metal gun was n't a move toward making firearms with a 3 - d printer cheaper or more accessible , she wrote			2
basic 3 - d printers , such as the @entity58 2 , can be bought for around $ 2,000			2
but @entity9 used a specialized , high - end printer whose cost would be out of reach of most people			0
" the industrial printer we used costs more than my college tuition ( and i went to a private university ) , " @entity48 said			1
" and the engineers who run our machines are top of the line ; they are experts who know what they 're doing and understand @entity72 printing better than anyone in this business			0
" solid concepts wanted to show that 3 - d printing is more than just hobbyists churning out plastic doodads -- it 's a viable option for serious commercial use			1
" it 's a common misconception that 3 - d printing is n't accurate or strong enough , and we 're working to change people 's perspectives , " @entity81 , a vice president at the company , said in a statement			2
in may , a nonprofit group , also from @entity1 , stirred far more controversy when it posted a video of the live firing of a plastic handgun created with a 3 - d printer			2
@entity95 , a 25 - year - old self - described anarchist , posted instructions on how to make the gun online through his nonprofit group , @entity98			0
those instructions were taken down after the @entity99 sent the group a cease - and - desist letter			0
the group 's website was shut down shortly afterward			0
