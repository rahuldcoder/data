-- a young man jangles a stack of coins , organizes his passengers like they 're shapes in a game of @entity7 , then bangs on the side of the colorful bus			1
we move off , clattering along the noisy , dusty road			2
the city is @entity13 , @entity16 's biggest and the place president @entity14 hung out on his july visit to @entity18			1
the man is the conductor and his bus is a " dala dala " -- hordes of which toot and rattle along the key arteries through @entity13 every day			1
this city is often ignored by travelers heading to @entity16 's big tourist destinations -- it 's not hard to see why			1
" @entity13 " has few obvious attractions and can get hot and sticky			2
its streets are filled with traffic , exhaust fumes and dust			0
yet it has charm and for anyone willing to experience some " @entity40 " via one of these eccentric buses , the rewards can be great			0
( " @entity40 " is the @entity16 brand of r&b / hip hop , which originates here in @entity44 , the local nickname for @entity13 )			1

more : high peaks and wildlife put @entity16 on the tourist map @entity87 market variety @entity87 market , the largest market in @entity18 , is worth the stop			0
it covers several blocks of shops , stalls and courtyards all set around an imposing indoor market built in the 1970s			1
its high vaulted arches provide an odd setting for the small hardware sellers who inhabit it			0
downstairs there 's a huge basement complex where fruit and vegetable traders dwell in semi-darkness			1
above ground @entity87 is full of color and trade in a huge variety of goods , from farming tools and food to bows and arrows			0

at the other end , their haul is cooked up in huge sizzling frying pans			0
still chewing some deep - red fried octopus , i board a dala dala moving along the seafront			1
although color - coding makes them they look like a single organized collective , dala dalas are private enterprises and feature a range of individual touches representing the owners ' tastes and allegiances			1
the most obvious of these are slogans many carry on the windshield sunshade , ranging from religious ( " @entity199 , " " @entity200 " ) to @entity198 ( " @entity201 " ) to cryptic ( " @entity202 , " " @entity203 " )			0
in this sense they 're cousins to the jeepneys of the @entity207			1
the one taking me along @entity210 front features tassels around its windows and has a sound system playing @entity40			0
the dala dala travels along the line of distinctive old colonial government buildings built by the @entity218 in the 1890s and @entity220 in the 1920s ( well preserved and used by the current @entity16 government ) followed by impressive @entity222 and @entity224 cathedrals			2
from here , it 's a short hop to the @entity227 , @entity228			2
this part of town has a different feel to the @entity232 where @entity87 is located			0

many have @entity46 security guards standing outside			0
these members of the famous pastoralist tribe ( easily recognizable by their tall , robed frames ) have been forced by drought and other factors to leave their traditional lifestyle and move to the towns and cities in search of work			0
