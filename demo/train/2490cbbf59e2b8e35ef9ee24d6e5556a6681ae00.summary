-- with at least two winners sharing a prize of more than a half - billion dollars , tuesday 's @entity2 lottery may have drawn more players than any previous drawing			1
but they may be the lucky ones , in more ways than you think			0

and most of them probably ca n't afford to play , anyway			1
still , they line up to place their dollars on the counter , all for a snowball 's chance at an instant miracle , even as that miracle has gotten harder to attain			1
lotteries and games of chance such as the @entity2 , or more traditional casinos , have come in vogue among politicians seeking to raise revenues without raising taxes			1
this seems like a net win all around — players receive the entertainment of playing and we all enjoy the benefits of higher funding for schools or other public works			1
unfortunately the reality is not so rosy			0
related : you won the big one -- now what ? those in poverty or near poverty not only are more likely to play the lottery than those with greater means , they also spend a larger percent of their money on average on these games of chance			1
some have argued that this may not be such a bad thing if the poor basically play the lottery as a cheap form of entertainment			1
however , when we look for the telltale signs of entertainment behavior , they are absent			0
we do n't see evidence that changes in the availability or price of other entertainment , movies for example , lead to changes in lotto purchases			0
rather , we find there are big jumps in lottery purchases when the poverty rate increases , when unemployment increases , or when people enroll on welfare			1
lottery playing among the poor is a @entity86 investment strategy — a small ray of hope among the hopeless			1
but this false hope is , by design , an attempt to lure the emotional decision - maker			2
recent changes in the @entity2 lottery have reduced the chances of winning in order to increase the size of the jackpot			1
by changing the range of the six possible numbers drawn -- from between 1 and 56 to between 1 and 75 -- the already improbable odds of 1 in 176 million have diminished to a virtually impossible 1 in 259 million			2
fewer big winners means larger jackpots , more hype and more players			0
and more money for the lotteries			0
related : $ 800 million in lottery prizes unclaimed such changes have occurred as the lottery commissions have become expert in swindling players out of their money			1
humans are n't particularly good at dealing with risks and gambles			0
we tend to believe that rare events are more common than they truly are			0
moreover , we do n't discern between small changes in very low probabilities			0
thus , few will have noticed that the odds of winning the lottery reduced from 0.000000006 to 0.000000004 for any given ticket			1
but our eyes are drawn to the steadily increasing prizes — prizes that are now designed to eventually exceed $ 1 billion			2
such astronomical amounts draw in even those who consider themselves very prudent			0
when the prizes get this large , many start to rationalize the purchase of a ticket			0
in the end , there are few who win money , and many who simply lose a few dollars with nothing to show for it			0
but those few dollars add up			0
for example , the average annual per capita spending on lottery tickets in @entity142 is nearly $ 800			1
that is $ 800 being spent for every man , woman and child in the state			2
that is more than six times the average per capita food stamp benefit			0
some of this $ 800 goes to schools , constituting about 1 - 2 % of school budgets in many states			2
the majority of this $ 800 , however , goes to a very small number of lucky winners who take home what seems like infinite wealth that is sure to change their life forever			2
related : no lotteries in these 7 states approximately one third of lottery winners will declare bankruptcy			2
this happens primarily because new winners are so unfamiliar with the magnitude of the money they have won , that they simply overestimate the purchasing power			0
how could i ever need to budget when i have several hundred million in the bank ? the overwhelming majority of lottery winners do n't believe they are better off for having won			1
one study finds that recent lottery winners have lower levels of happiness than do those who have recently become quadriplegic			2
apparently , winning the lottery is not what the hype would have you believe			1
personally , i would probably prefer an $ 800 tax			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

at least two people will share the $ 648 million jackpot from tuesday 's @entity2 lottery
most who play know they have little chance of winning anything
just : lottery playing by poor a @entity86 investment strategy , a ray of hope among the hopeless
