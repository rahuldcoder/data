when the " @entity2 " went into effect 20 years ago this month , @entity0 took a historic stand against gun violence			1
it was the first federal law to require that licensed dealers refer every gun sale to law enforcement for a background check			1
the law honored my husband , @entity11 , who had been shot in the head in 1981 by @entity14 , a mentally ill man who attempted to assassinate president @entity15			2
the shooting left @entity11 permanently impaired physically and cognitively			0
since february 28 , 1994 , according to the @entity18 , background checks have stopped more than 2 million gun purchases by " prohibited purchasers " like convicted felons , domestic abusers , the dangerously mentally ill and fugitives â€” people who we all agree should not have guns			2
it 's easy to imagine how many lives were saved and how many disabling injuries prevented thanks to @entity11 background checks			1
but a lot has changed over the past two decades , and people who would n't pass a background check have found other ways to procure guns easily through unlicensed sales at gun shows or on the @entity39 , where background checks are not required			1
opinion : the man who made people talk about guns the corporate gun lobby would like us to think these unlicensed sales are transactions between family members and hunting buddies , but the truth is that thousands of guns are sold legally each day without a background check , thereby potentially putting guns directly in the hands of criminals			1
in fact , websites like @entity58 boast upward of 70,000 listings from private sellers , many touting " no background check " as a selling feature			0
as a result , an estimated 40 % of gun sales today occur without a @entity11 background check			1
many of these sales have deadly consequences			0
take @entity70 , a victim of domestic violence who procured a restraining order against her estranged husband , making him unable to pass a background check			2
he bought a semiautomatic handgun from a private seller online , where he did n't need a background check			0
he used that gun to kill @entity70 and two others and wound four more at a nail salon			0
let 's think about background checks in another way			0
imagine if @entity70 's husband were on the no fly list and was one of 40 % of airline passengers the @entity89 allowed to fly without undergoing a security screening			2
would @entity0 feel safe in the air in this scenario ? not likely			0
yet that is precisely the percentage of gun purchases made daily without a background check			2
opinion : the warrior , the hero , the ' @entity100 ' so what 's the solution ? @entity103 needs to finish the job the @entity11 law so effectively started to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of people who should not have them			1
@entity103 must pick up where it left off last april when , to @entity11 's and my great disappointment , @entity114 legislation to expand @entity11 background checks fell short			1
the bill received a majority 54 votes , including the support of six " a-rated " @entity121 senators , two of whom were the lead sponsors			0
the @entity0 people support this legislation			0
in fact , 90 % of @entity0 support universal background checks covering all online sales and gun shows			1
three out of four @entity121 members and 80 % of gun owners agree that the scope of background checks needs to be expanded			1
in 2013 , after the horrific tragedy of the school shooting in @entity137 , @entity138 , eight states passed meaningful gun regulations			0
these laws could save lives and prevent injuries			0
let 's keep moving forward			0
let 's finish the job , expand @entity11 background checks and help keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people .			1

" @entity2 " went into effect 20 years ago
@entity153 : the law , which honors her husband , requires background checks
but a lot has changed , about 40 % of gun sales today have no @entity11 background check
@entity11 : @entity103 needs to finish the job the @entity11 law so effectively started in 1981
