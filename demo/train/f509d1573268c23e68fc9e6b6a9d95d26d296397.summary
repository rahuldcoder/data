-- finding a " smoking gun " linking @entity4 and @entity5 became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the @entity9 administration authorized in 2002 , a former @entity2 official told @entity0 on thursday			1
@entity12 's office ordered use of " alternative " techniques against @entity16 's recommendations , aide says			2
the allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former vice president @entity12 by @entity19 , chief of staff for then - secretary of state @entity20			1
in it , @entity19 wrote that the interrogation program began in april and may of 2002 , and then - vice president @entity12 's office kept close tabs on the questioning			1
" its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the @entity31 but discovering a smoking gun linking @entity4 and @entity5 , " @entity19 wrote in the @entity26 , an online political journal			1
@entity19 , a retired @entity33 colonel , said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials			2
he said he has been " relentlessly digging " since 2004 , when @entity20 asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at @entity4 's @entity41 prison			2
" i could n't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody , but i 'm pretty sure it 's fairly accurate , " he told @entity0			0
most of @entity19 's online essay criticizes @entity12 's recent defense of the " alternative " interrogation techniques the @entity9 administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists			1
@entity12 has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on @entity31			1
critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in @entity31 custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them			2
representatives of the former vice president declined comment on @entity19 's allegations			1
but @entity19 told @entity0 that by early 2002 , @entity31 officials had decided that " we had @entity5 pretty much on the run			1
" " the priority had turned to other purposes , and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between @entity5 and @entity74 , " he said			2
the argument that @entity4 could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as @entity5 was a key element of the @entity9 administration 's case for the march 2003 invasion			1
but after the invasion , @entity4 was found to have dismantled its nuclear , chemical and biological weapons programs , and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities			0
@entity19 wrote that in one case , the @entity16 told @entity12 's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now " compliant , " meaning agents recommended the use of " alternative " techniques should stop			1
at that point , " the vp 's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods , " @entity19 wrote			2
" the detainee had not revealed any @entity5 - @entity74 contacts yet			0
this ceased only after @entity106 , under waterboarding in @entity107 , ' revealed ' such contacts			0
" @entity110 's claim that @entity4 dictator @entity112 's government had trained @entity5 operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the october 2002 speech then - president @entity9 gave when pushing @entity116 to authorize military action against @entity4			1
it also was part of @entity20 's february 2003 presentation to the @entity120 on the case for war , a speech @entity20 has called a " blot " on his record			0
@entity110 later recanted the claim , saying it was made under torture by @entity107 intelligence agents , a claim @entity107 denies			0
he died last week in a @entity132 prison , reportedly a suicide , @entity130 reported			0
@entity134 , a counterterrorism adviser for the @entity31 - based group , called @entity106 's allegation " pivotal " to the @entity9 administration 's case for war , as it connected @entity74 to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on @entity139 and @entity140			0
and an @entity33 psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the @entity148 prison camp in @entity149 told the service 's inspector - general that interrogators there were trying to connect @entity5 and @entity4			1
" this is my opinion , " maj. @entity153 told the inspector - general 's office			0
" even though they were giving information and some of it was useful , while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between @entity164 and @entity4 and we were not being successful in establishing a link between @entity164 and @entity4			0
the more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results			0
" @entity153 's account was included in a @entity173 report released in april			0
other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence " but did not recall pressure to identify links between @entity4 and @entity5 , " the @entity173 report states			1
@entity12 criticized @entity20 during a television interview over the weekend , saying he no longer considers @entity20 a fellow @entity181 after his former colleague endorsed @entity184 candidate @entity183 in the 2008 presidential election			0
@entity19 said he is not speaking for his former boss and does not know whether @entity20 shares his views .			0

@entity19 criticizes @entity12 for defending interrogation methods
interrogations aimed at finding " smoking gun " linking @entity4 and @entity5 , he says
by 2002 , @entity31 officials decided " we had @entity5 pretty much on the run , " he says
