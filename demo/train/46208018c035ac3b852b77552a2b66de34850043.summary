-- finding superlative examples of @entity3 's national dish is n't as easy as tracking down great cheese in @entity5 or sublime sushi in @entity7			1
serving originally as cheap and filling fodder for the country 's burgeoning 19th - century working class , most of the 250 million portions of fish and chips sold today by @entity3 's 10,000 or so vendors of the dish -- " chippies " to locals -- remain unappetizing concoctions of gray - colored fish in soggy batter , accompanied by anemic chips and flaccid little sachets of ketchup			1
little wonder that so many first time visitors to the @entity3 wonder what all the fuss is about -- never mind where to find mouthwash strong enough to remove the taste of stale cooking fat from their mouths			1
that 's a shame , because some establishments are great exceptions to the mediocre rule			2
many are family - run enterprises that use local produce and provide an experience that marries the aroma of the ocean with the warmth of the hearth inside one delicious paper - wrapped package			2

the @entity83 ( @entity84 , @entity85 ) it 's smart to keep an eye on your watch if you make the journey to this ramshackle but welcoming little seafood shack near the ancient @entity94 town of @entity95 ; if your timing is off , you risk being stranded when the tide surrounds the miniscule island where the chippy perches			2
not that this would be such a bad thing , with the fabulous array of seafood to be consumed at the basic picnic tables here , from native oysters at 80p each to crab - and - lobster rolls , cockles , prawns and locally smoked salmon			2
prices are a fraction of what you 'd pay in @entity113 , and you can bring your own wine			2
we recommend : the cold seafood platter			2

we recommend : wholetail scampi with chips and salad			1

@entity151 and @entity152 ( @entity113 ) with high prices matched by low quality , the @entity153 of @entity113 is something of a fish and chip tourist trap			1

@entity194 ( @entity195 ) this prosaically named chippy in genteel @entity195 is almost as much of a local legend as the devilish imps that supposedly escaped from the city 's spectacular cathedral in medieval times			0
the preferred fish here is battered haddock -- cod typically rules in the south of @entity3 and haddock in the north			1
everything is fried to order and almost all the menu items are prepared on the premises from scratch			0
we recommend : haddock , chips and scraps ( bits of batter from the bottom of the fryer )			2

@entity222 ( @entity223 ) buried deep in the @entity224 , far from the coastline , it 's the commitment to quality ingredients that makes this chippy run by the parents of @entity3 tv presenter @entity230 stand out -- fish are delivered daily from the port of @entity233			1
the fish cakes are tire - sized , and this is just the place to try a chippy custom peculiar to the region : pouring thick gravy over the chips before consuming with the fish			1
( it 's nicer than it sounds			0
) we recommend : haddock , chips and gravy			1

haddock and cod are supplemented by sea bass and plaice			0
servers will bake rather than fry for you if the thought of an entire deep - fried fish is going to break your vow to finally lose some weight this year			2
we recommend : fish goujons , steak pudding and chips			1
