@entity1 opponents of @entity3 - backed legislation that would rein in @entity5 surveillance programs narrowly blocked the @entity6 from taking up the bill tuesday after warning it could help terrorists escape detection			1
on a tally of 58 to 42 , a procedural vote failed to get the supermajority 60 votes it needed to advance			1
supporters of the @entity16 , a rare mix of @entity18 and libertarian @entity1 , hoped public outrage over the secret mass collection of phone and @entity23 records -- revealed by former @entity5 contractor @entity24 -- would lead to passage of the reforms			1
but many opponents argued the changes would hamper the @entity5 's ability to track nimble and elusive terrorists			1
@entity32 leader @entity32 led the charge against the bill , saying the new rules would prevent the @entity36 from capturing the terrorists who killed @entity37 , a @entity36 citizen doing aid work in @entity39			1
@entity37 was executed over the weekend			0
" many of these fighters are familiar with @entity36 's intelligence capabilities , and many are savvy with communications			0
these are terrorists who know how to use encryption , and they how to change devices quickly , " he said			0
" this is the worst time to be tying our hands behind our backs			0
" " it basically takes us back to a pre- 9/11 lack of capacity to identify terrorists making telephone calls in the @entity36 , said sen. @entity56 of @entity57 , the second - ranking @entity6 @entity1			2
" i think that sort of unilateral disarmament would be bad for the country			0
" @entity62 also argued the measure should be debated and voted on in the new @entity64 next year , not by lawmakers in a lame duck session who are leaving @entity68			0
sen. @entity69 , @entity70 , the bill 's principal author , disputed the critics saying that while it puts checks on the @entity5 's powerful capabilities , it " does so responsibly			1
" " the bill contains key reforms to safeguard @entity36 ' privacy by prohibiting the indiscriminate collection of their data			2
it also provides for greater accountability and transparency of the government 's surveillance programs , " he said			2
" the bill also ensures that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep our country safe			2
" under the bill , the government could no longer store massive amounts of call information in its databases , a practice president @entity97 said he wanted to end			1
that job would fall to the large telecommunication companies			0
but the government could get permission from a secret surveillance court to review specific call information if it could show it might be linked to terrorists			1
sen. @entity105 , @entity106 , who chairs the @entity107 , said this arrangement " solves " a " very practical problem " raised by those who are uncomfortable with the government storing calling records of @entity36			0
but sen. @entity114 , @entity115 , said the public 's privacy would be better protected by strict federal government safeguards of that information than by the thousands of employees at private phone companies			2
in a statement monday , the @entity3 urged passage of the bill			1
" this legislation will help strengthen @entity36 ' confidence in the government 's use of these important national security authorities			0
without passage of this bill , critical authorities that are appropriately reformed in this legislation could expire next summer			0
the administration urges @entity64 to take action on this legislation now , since delay may subject these important national security authorities to brinksmanship and uncertainty			0
" the bill is supported by a coalition of technology companies , including @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , who have deep concerns that their customers ' privacy is being violated by the current @entity5 techniques			1
supporters suffered a setback last week when sen. @entity153 , @entity154 , who had favored the measure , announced he would not back it			0
however , other like - minded @entity1 such as sen. @entity157 of @entity57 and sen. @entity158 of @entity159 voted to advance the bill .			1

supporters of bill that would curb @entity5 fail to get supermajority of 60 votes
@entity3 , @entity18 and some libertarian @entity1 supported the bill
@entity32 leader @entity32 led the charge against the bill
under bill , government could no longer keep large amounts of call information in its databases
