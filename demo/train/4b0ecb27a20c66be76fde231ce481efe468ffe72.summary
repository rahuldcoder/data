-- she has been dreaming about this day for as long as i can remember			1
ever since she was small , my daughter @entity3 has fantasized about her wedding day			1
it took her a while , but it 's finally becoming reality			1
at the age of 32 , she has found the man with whom she wants to spend her life			1
he was born and raised right here in @entity12 , @entity13 , the same kibbutz where she was born			1
they have known each other all their lives , but since they are two years apart , they never really paid much attention to each other as they were growing up			2
all this makes it all the more special			2
our lives on the border with @entity27 , in the western @entity23 of @entity13 , are always tumultuous			2
there are times of running for shelters and explosions too close for comfort			2
but never has it been this sensitive , this close , this personally painful			2
think about your own life			2
what is the worst thing that could happen to wedding plans ? the caterer could suddenly go bankrupt ? the weather could turn bad ? can you imagine having to worry that a rocket could blow up during the reception ? or planning for the prospect of a " red - alert " rocket - warning siren going off in the middle of the vows , sending family and friends scrambling in a panic for cover ? this close to the border , we have no more than 15 seconds to make it to a shelter before the mortar explodes			1
the planning of the wedding , which has been going on for months , is an event @entity3 had been working up to -- on one level or another -- for most of her life			1
the decision to marry here , on our kibbutz , by the pool , made my heart soar			2
they have been working on their plans painstakingly , doing much of the work on their own			2
they scrimped and saved , and had friends pitch in to decorate jars with lace and paint the wall at the amphitheater at the pool , all in order to prepare a simple , low - key , beautiful wedding			1
it was meant to be on their own terms , on their own turf			2
the place where they both were born ; the place where they want to settle down and raise a brood of their own			0

invitations have gone out and loved ones have rsvp 'd			0
the caterer is set and the dress has been bought			0
tables and chairs have been ordered			0
their ceremony has been planned to the letter , with their friends and loved ones playing the leading roles			1
in short : everything is in place , all systems " go			0
" the only thing is , given the events of the past few days , we literally have to go			1
we must move the venue , because there is no way we can risk endangering the lives of our guests			0
the current situation has escalated at a terrifying rate and we can not take the risk			0
the wedding is now going to be held in @entity129 , about an hour and a half away from the original venue			1
it is a beautiful , safe place in the middle of the country -- if there really is such a thing as a safe place here in this tiny land			1
they wanted a friday evening wedding , to be married at sunset			1
it will now be in the afternoon because of logistical limitations			0
the victory of finding a safer location is bittersweet : there have not been any weddings on @entity149 for years , and this was going to be a very special , symbolic occasion for our community as well as for our family			0
the ironic truth is that , of all my children , @entity3 was the only one terrified of living here on the border with @entity27			0
she has suffered from nightmares and fears , refusing to walk around after dark on her own			0
this despite the fact that there is practically no crime in this community where everyone knows everyone else			0
she , of all the children , is the one child i never would have dreamt would be settling on @entity149 to raise a family			0
any of my other children ? maybe			0
she was just too deeply certain that terrorists would infiltrate the kibbutz and pop up right under her window			0
for years she searched , trying to find life elsewhere : in the @entity177 for a while , in the center of @entity13 -- anywhere but on the border with @entity27			0
until she came back and fell in love with a man who wants to live no place else but here			0
instead of celebrating the wedding of her dreams , we found ourselves confronted with the nightmare of having to find a secure location , and the additional significant expenses involved in moving the celebration to a safer environment			1
but we have taken those lemons and turned them into formidable lemonade			0
this is life on the border with the @entity27 : peaceful and welcoming most of the time , but occasionally , a battlefield with sirens and explosions			0
occasionally a place where we hear bombs instead of wedding bells			1
