@entity15 , an attorney representing @entity3 's family , said at a news conference in @entity17 , @entity18 , on monday that there is " ample " evidence from an independent autopsy conducted on the teen 's body to support the arrest of the police officer who shot @entity3			1
" already based on this limited information , people believe it plays into whatever theory they have about what happened , " @entity27 senior media correspondent @entity26 said			1
" because these shots were all in the front apparently , that might lend credence to people 's theories that @entity3 was going after the police officer			1
" on the other hand , " @entity26 added , " the shots were on the arms ( and head ) on the front			1
does that mean his arms were up ? " it 's a case , he said , where more information is not necessarily better information			2
therein lies some of the risk			0
" this is bound to escalate tensions , " the rev. @entity49 said			0
" this is a very provocative report			0
" accounts unclear @entity3 , an unarmed black teenager , was shot dead nine days ago by a white police officer			1

several witnesses said @entity3 raised his hands and was not attacking the officer			2
last week , the @entity78 said an original autopsy found that @entity3 , 18 , died of gunshot wounds			1
but the department would n't say how many times he was shot or any other details			0
" we are not specifying how many gunshot wounds at this point , " the department said			2
" the investigation into his death is still ongoing , and the full autopsy is not likely to be released for many weeks because multiple law enforcement agencies are now involved in the investigation			0
" the lack of information prompted @entity3 's family to request an independent autopsy			1

" the family wants to know what happened			2
and why should they just rely upon on what the authorities to tell them ? " not shot at close range according to @entity97 's autopsy , the bullets that struck @entity3 were not fired from close range , as indicated by the absence of gunpowder residue on his body			1
some of the bullets left several wounds			2
one of the bullets shattered his right eye , traveled through his face , exited his jaw and re-entered at his collarbone , according to the autopsy			0

one entered the top of his @entity3 's skull , suggesting that his head was bent forward when he was struck			1
more work to be done @entity97 intends to do much more than just the autopsy			0
he may ask questions about the officer 's gun as well			0
" is there only the police officer 's dna on that gun			0
or if there was , in fact , a struggle , is @entity3 's dna on that gun as well ? that would certainly say a lot about whether a struggle for the gun took place			1

the autopsy will be conducted by a federal medical examiner			0
