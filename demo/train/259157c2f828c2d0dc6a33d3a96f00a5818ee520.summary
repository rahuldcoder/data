-- when @entity2 completed his dramatic deadline - day transfer from @entity4 to @entity5 last month , he became the latest in a long line of flamboyant big - name players to move to the @entity8			1
most would agree the attacking prowess of the 26 - year - old party - loving , @entity11 striker would help bolster the attack of any team in the world , but it 's his ability to help decide the future of @entity18 politics that was arguably just as attractive to his new employers			1
that is because club owner @entity22 also happens to be the prime minister of @entity18 and -- according to leading commentators -- @entity5 's success has been inextricably linked to @entity22 's rise to power			1
it could be just a coincidence of course , but @entity2 's arrival , on the back of the purchase of @entity33 superstar striker @entity32 comes at an apposite time for the beleaguered statesman			1
the 73 - year - old has the support of less than 30 percent of voters according to a recent poll for the newspaper @entity40 -- following the defections of dozens of members of parliament in july and the departure of @entity45 -- a co-founder of @entity22 's ruling " @entity49 , " over policy disagreements			1
so could the capture of @entity2 help shore up @entity18 's coalition government ? there is no doubt that @entity22 is a man who stirs the emotions of his compatriots in many different ways			1
to his followers , he is an achiever			0
an innovator , somebody who has changed @entity18 culture and business practices for the better			2
a world statesman of the very highest caliber			0
to his critics , he is a chancer ; an embarrassment who continually flouts his authority with bizarre decision making amid lurid accusations about his personal life			0
and , to the supporters of @entity5 , he is the man in power			2
the owner , to be cheered when results are going well and jeered after another defeat			0
@entity78 - based football journalist @entity77 has no doubt there is a correlation between @entity22 's standing in the opinion polls and the arrival of big - name stars at his beloved @entity5			1
" @entity22 will frequently use the club to recreate a wining image for himself , " @entity77 told @entity0			2
" off the pitch , his center - right coalition government is under great pressure at the moment			0
and , on the pitch , he was forced to watch rivals @entity93 win everything last season			0
" @entity77 added : " @entity22 was also shocked by some of the banners he saw fans holding , when he turned up to watch the team train in july			2
he knew he had to buy some big names to boost his popularity , that 's why @entity2 and @entity32 have arrived			1
" @entity22 has always seen @entity5 as a huge publicity vehicle and likes rubbing shoulders with the big - name players he can attract			1
it 's all part of the image , that 's why @entity110 has twice played here			0
it boosts " brand @entity112 " when the polls suggest he needs a boost			0
" the career paths of @entity22 the politician and @entity22 the football club owner run hand - in - hand as the billionaire has unashamedly courted the popular " football " vote to achieve his political aspirations			1
when deciding to enter the political arena by creating a new party in 1993 , @entity22 chose the popular football chant " @entity126 " -- roughly translated as " @entity127 " -- a name that helped progress the businessman to the office of prime minister within a year			2
@entity22 's sudden and spectacular rise to the political summit came just as one of the greatest @entity5 sides of all time was marching towards the @entity18 league title			1
in fact , in the same may month that @entity22 was sworn into power , his @entity5 side -- boasting @entity142 superstars @entity143 and @entity144 -- thrashed @entity33 4 - 0 in one of the most devastating @entity147 final displays ever seen			1
political analyst @entity148 , dean of the @entity149 in @entity78 , told @entity0 : " the success of @entity5 definitely helped propel @entity22 's political aspirations and it is doubtful whether he would be prime minister now without that link			1
" @entity22 is a unique man			0
whatever he touches turns to gold and his only aim is to be a success			0
the split in his coalition means he has some political maneuvering to do to avoid a possible election next year			0
" but , if an election did happen , signing some big names to help @entity5 achieve success again can only help his cause with the electorate			2
" where @entity5 's transfer policy appears to differ from many of their rivals is their apparent willingness to sign players that come with " baggage " , be it big egos like @entity32 , a party - loving image like @entity2 and @entity179 , or the media frenzy that surrounds @entity110			1
it has lead to criticism that @entity22 is ultimately overseeing a short - term policy that sums up his own personality , rather than encourage the long - term success and growth that signing younger , less well - known , players could bring			2
@entity148 believes there is a reason for this			0
" @entity22 's successes have straddled politics , sport and the media			1
he brought commercial satellite tv channels into people 's homes and likes the glamour that these big stars bring to him and his team			0
" the fact that some players might have suspect temperaments will not be a concern to him			0
he just wants to win and win for the present			0
do n't forget he is not a young man			0
he wants to be around to see @entity5 win the big trophies and by signing these players it is the best way to achieve that success			2

@entity2 is the latest big - name player to be signed by @entity18 *giants* @entity5
the @entity214 striker joins @entity32 at the @entity8 for this season
the signings come as @entity22 's popularity is on the wane in the opinion polls
some commentators believe the @entity5 owner uses the club to boost his political popularity
