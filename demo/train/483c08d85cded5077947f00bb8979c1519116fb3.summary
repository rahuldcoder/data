-- in 2003 , @entity1 became the first state to legalize same - sex marriage			1
at that time , 60 % of @entity4 opposed the idea and the move provoked an immediate backlash			1
in the next year , 12 states passed constitutional amendments outlawing same - sex marriage			1
eventually 30 states , including traditionally liberal @entity12 , passed such measures			0
but since then there has been an astounding transformation of public opinion and legal thinking			0
support for gay and lesbian civil rights , starting from a much lower base than support for racial and gender equality , has risen with stunning speed			1
between 2003 and 2013 , the proportion of @entity4 supporting same - sex marriage rose 21 points nationwide , from 32 % to 53 % , writes @entity27 in the @entity28			1
even in the socially conservative @entity29 , support more than doubled , increasing from 22 % to 48 %			0
by contrast , in 1978 , 11 years after the @entity30 struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage , only 36 % of @entity4 supported such unions			1
this rapid and massive change in public attitudes toward same - sex marriage undercuts the argument that " judicial activism " has frustrated the will of the @entity4 people			1
but the legal tide has certainly turned as well			0
in the past year and a half , 42 separate court rulings have upheld marriage rights for gays and lesbians			2
because of this month 's @entity30 decision not to hear appeals of such rulings , 24 states and the @entity52 now permit same - sex marriage			1
today more than 50 % of @entity4 live in places where it is legal for gays and lesbians to wed. that will soon rise to 60 % , because the @entity30 's actions affect six other states in the judicial circuits overseen by the same appellate courts			1
many factors have contributed to these changes in public and legal opinion			0
one is the increased visibility of gays and lesbians across the culture , as more come out of the closet			2
three - quarters of @entity4 now say they have a relative , friend or co-worker who is gay and millions have become used to sympathetic gay and lesbian characters on television and to openly gay talk - show hosts and entertainers			1
it is harder to deny rights to people who are no longer faceless " others			0
" another factor in the rapid acceptance of marriage equality is the success the civil rights and feminist movements have had in establishing social equality as a moral and ethical principle			1
fifty years ago , when the @entity93 was introduced in @entity94 , congressional opponents openly vowed to resist anything that might " bring about social equality			1
" no public figure would say that today			0
even politicians who oppose measures to protect the rights of minorities , women or gays and lesbians now frame their opposition as a defense of equality against " special privileges			2
" so when advocates for social change can claim their goal is a simple matter of equity , they have an advantage they lacked in the 1960s and even the 1970s , when substantial numbers of @entity4 were still willing to admit to opposing gender and racial equality			1
a third factor behind changing public opinion has been the growing tendency to treat freedom of choice in marriage as a basic right			0
this was not the case historically			0
before the late 1960s , a majority of states had laws prohibiting marriage of whites to blacks , @entity134 or @entity135			0
twelve states forbade " drunks " or " mental defectives " from marrying			0
several states denied marriage to any person with tuberculosis			0
prisoners had no right to marry , and employers were legally entitled to refuse to hire a woman who was married , or to fire her if she married after getting the job			0
but in 1967 , invalidating anti-miscegenation laws , and in 1987 , ruling that prisoners could not be denied marriage rights , the @entity30 ruled that states could not prohibit marriages just because they disapproved of the partnership			2
once it became a violation of individual rights to prevent prisoners , inter-racial couples , flight attendants , and female teachers from marrying , gays and lesbians could argue that they , too , should have the right to marry a partner of their choice			2
ironically , the most important factor in persuading many @entity4 to support same - sex marriage may have been the dramatic changes heterosexuals have made in their own marriages			1
for thousands of years , marriage was defined as the union of two individuals who had different and unequal rights and responsibilities based on their gender			2
until the late 1970s , husbands -- but not wives -- were legally obliged to support their families , while wives -- but not husbands -- were legally obliged to perform services ( including providing sex ) in the home			0
this is why the legal definition of rape was a man 's forcible intercourse with a woman not his wife			0
it is also why a husband could sue for the loss of companionship , affection and sex ( when the actions of another deprived him of the relationship benefits he was due ) , but a wife , who was not legally entitled to such services , could not			0
in the past 30 years , however , as @entity4 have rejected such rigid gender roles , the courts have redefined marriage as a union of two individuals who have equal rights and responsibilities , and who can organize their marital division of labor on the basis of personal inclinations rather than pre-assigned gender roles			1
as late as 1977 , two - thirds of @entity4 believed that the man should be " the achiever outside the home " and the woman should take " care of the home and family			2
" today 62 % of all @entity4 prefer a marriage where husband and wife share breadwinning , child care , and homemaking			1
the more that heterosexual couples organize their own marriages without regard to gender roles , the less reasonable they find it to deny marriage to two people who happen to be the same biological sex .			2

@entity236 : since first same - sex marriage state , @entity4 attitudes have changed fast
number of @entity4 living where gay marriage legal will likely soon reach 60 % , she says
@entity236 : more high profile gays in culture ; plus civil rights , feminism widened view on social equality
@entity236 : big shifts in *concept* of equality in heterosexual marriage also helped clear path
