-- these are tumultuous times for @entity3 tennis player @entity2			1
the 28 - year - old might be the only player from an @entity6 country in the men 's draw at the @entity9 , but his first - round win over @entity11 7 - 6 , 4 - 6			1
6 - 3 has once more showcased the @entity3 's remarkable powers of perseverance in the face of injury and political turmoil in his homeland			1
professionally @entity2 has never looked back since the @entity3 revolution , which sparked the region 's @entity20 and toppled the regime of @entity24 @entity23			1
. at the start of the revolution @entity2 was ranked 342nd ; by the end of 2011 he was up to 150th ; and now , following this week 's release of the latest rankings , the @entity3 has climbed to 67th after recording his first win at @entity31			1
" i decided to come back from living in @entity34 to practise , " @entity2 told @entity0 , as he recalled the events that led to @entity23 's fall			1
" the weather is always good and i was close to my family -- then one week after i got back , the revolution happened			2
it was n't easy , but it made me feel better , and my ranking got better			0
" at first it was very hard to practize and to travel to play			2
the airport was closed , there were helicopters and shooting			0
but now it 's safe , everyone is feeling good			2
i 'm an ambassador for @entity3 and it is my source de l'inspiration			1
we have history , the desert , the sea , it 's like a paradise , really			2
" @entity57 , @entity58 @entity2 's rise up the rankings is even more remarkable given he missed two years through injury at the age of 22 -- a time when most players are establishing themselves professionally			1
" a few years ago when i was young , i was very promising , going very well , 200th in the rankings , being put forward for @entity65 , and then i had an accident			2
i injured my knee and i could n't play			2
" i spent the first year here in @entity3 with my family , but my knee was n't doing so well			1
i told my family that i would take one last chance going to @entity71			0
i went there , saw a @entity74 doctor , and after nine months i was running again			0
it was a very , very tough time for me though			0
" but a spate of injuries -- he also hurt his ankle and wrist -- badly affected @entity2 's confidence			1
" it 's true , i did n't get given much of a chance with injuries -- it was not easy for me			0
with my knee , i was sat at home unable to do anything			0
i said i would quit and work with my father in the family business			0
but then i took my last chance in @entity90 ... and thank @entity91 for that			0
" it is not just the intervention of a @entity90 doctor that provides fond memories of the @entity74 capital for @entity2 , who was born in the @entity3 city of @entity100			1
" during the war @entity103 crashed his plane in @entity100 , the town where i play , " said @entity2 , referring to the renowned @entity74 pilot , who was a keen tennis player and whom the stadium that hosts the @entity103 was named after			1
" they made a monument here for him			0
eighty per cent of clubs in @entity3 have clay courts and everyone watches @entity103			2
so far i 've played two @entity65 , and in @entity103 i won the first round , i 'm very happy			0
" carrying the hopes of a nation as well as his recent @entity65 achievements , @entity2 is making the most of his @entity9 experience , particularly given he needed a wildcard to enter the tournament			1
" i had just finished my first match at @entity31 when they told me that i had made the main draw in the @entity9			1
to win my first match at @entity31 and then to have the chance to play at the @entity9 was fantastic , i was twice as happy			1
" " i thank the @entity129 for giving me the wildcard to play at the @entity9 , it 's very important for me			1
i 'm very proud to play for my country , for @entity3 , and i hope to do good things			1
why @entity134 's friend is flying the @entity136 flag at @entity137 " it 's a very tough sensation to explain , when you hear the anthem of your country from on the podium			0
and i 'm not just representing my country at the games but also all @entity145 and @entity146 countries -- i can feel their support , it 's like a dream for me			0
" going solo it 's not just revolution and injury that @entity2 has had to overcome			1
earlier in his career he was even having to book his own hotels and train tickets as well as having to apply to enter tournaments			0
" at first i did n't have the chance to get a coach or staff			0
in the beginning it was tough , travelling alone , but then it becomes like a habit -- you 're always alone so you learn to take responsibility			0
i had to do everything myself			0
it 's a lot of small things , but it takes up a lot of time			0
" but his new - found success has brought sponsorship and that has enabled @entity177 to hire a coach and a fitness trainer , which perhaps explains his progression up the tennis ladder			0
" i 'm the new ambassador of tourism for @entity3 , the minister of tourism sponsors me , " added @entity2			1
" i would welcome everyone to @entity3 , it can be a second home to anyone			2
we have freedom and safety now			0
it will be very nice to promote @entity3 all around the world			2
the @entity9 is a dream for everyone , and i will be a part of it			2

@entity2 is the only @entity6 representative in the men 's singles @entity9 draw
during last year 's revolution in @entity3 , @entity2 rose almost 200 places in the rankings
this *summer* saw him play his first match in the @entity31 main draw
he is now sponsored by the @entity3 minister of tourism , and is an ambassador for the nation
