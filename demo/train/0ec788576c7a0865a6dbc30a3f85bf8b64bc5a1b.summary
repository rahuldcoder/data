a @entity1 mayor characterized as a " probable mastermind " in the mass abduction of 43 students has been taken into custody as authorities have tracked down a top target who eluded them for weeks -- even if they still have n't managed to locate the missing			1
@entity12 mayor @entity11 and his wife , @entity15 @entity14 -- dubbed " the imperial couple " by local media for how they presided over their southern @entity1 city -- were detained early tuesday morning at a house they had rented in @entity24 's @entity23 neighborhood			1
they did not resist arrest , authorities said			0
the couple had been staying in a house that appeared to be abandoned , and investigators first got suspicious when they saw a woman repeatedly entering and leaving the building , @entity1 attorney general @entity27 told reporters			2
that woman , @entity34 , was arrested alongside the mayor and his wife			2
authorities accused her of concealing the couple			0
their capture , which @entity41 spokesman @entity40 reported on his @entity43 account , signals a major milestone in the high - profile case			0
" i hope that this detention contributes in a decisive way to solving the investigation that the attorney general 's office is conducting , " @entity1 president @entity46 said as he praised authorities for the arrests tuesday			1
yet it 's not clear how much closer the arrests get investigators to finding the 43 students , wherever and in whatever state they now are , dead or alive			1
the victims were mostly men in their 20s studying to become teachers at a college in rural @entity62			1
on september 26 , they traveled on buses and vans to nearby @entity12 for a protest			1
they have n't been seen or heard from since			0
@entity27 has said that when @entity68 , along with @entity14 , learned the students ' protest would disrupt one of his events , the mayor ordered then - @entity12 police chief @entity74 to stop the demonstration			1
@entity27 cited information obtained from interrogated police officers and gang members			0
police blocked the highway leading into the city and shot at the students ' vehicles , killing at least one student			2
officers then took the remaining students away and , @entity27 said , handed them over to a local criminal gang known as @entity87			0
that gang not only had infiltrated the police department but was also complicit with @entity68 , his wife and the now - former police chief , according to the attorney general			1
authorities have arrested about 60 suspects , but not the most sought - after ones -- until now			0
@entity68 and @entity14 went missing only hours after the students ' reported abduction			2
on october 22 , @entity27 said his office had issued arrest warrants for them as well as @entity101 , who remains at large			0
he said they were considered " probable masterminds " of the events in @entity12			1
the case has spurred protests across @entity24 , and the governor of @entity109 state -- criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions -- has taken a leave of absence			2
@entity112 , the academic tapped to take over for gov. @entity113 , told @entity114 last month that @entity109 state faces a tough road in light of the alleged corruption and kidnappings			0
" the problem today is how to successfully face these unleashed demons , " @entity112 said before his selection as interim governor			0
" how can we rebuild the social fabric ? " opinion : where are @entity24 's lost boys ?			1

@entity24 's president says he hopes the arrests will help solve the case
