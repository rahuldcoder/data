-- @entity1 is under fire following its delayed decision to recall 2.6 million cars over a faulty ignition switch			1
the automotive giant 's ceo says she is " deeply sorry " for 13 deaths caused by the defect			2
in isolation that 's bad enough			0
but it 's been exacerbated by another recall , this time of 1.3 million vehicles beset by a potentially dangerous power steering problem			0
critics might say it 's hardly unexpected from a company that took a $ 49.5 billion @entity20 bailout in 2008 and ended up costing the @entity22 tax payer $ 10.5 billion			2
apologists claim that if @entity1 had been allowed to wither and die , it would have cost the @entity22 in the region of $ 66 billion			1
probably more important is the potential human toll -- an industrial apocalypse like this would have wreaked on @entity1 's 212,000 - strong global work force			1
then there are the millions of employees working for the various suppliers who would also have suffered			0
but was saving @entity1 , and thereby condemning it to more of the same , really the triumph that some ( mainly blinkered @entity1 management ) claimed ? in 2013 , @entity1 ' global sales were up 4 % compared with the previous year			1
that 's in a market of worldwide vehicle sales that was up 7 %			0
@entity1 's big rival @entity40 's global sales increased by 12 % over the same period			1
@entity1 has multiple problems and none of them is new			1
lack of positive image and identity is one			1
hear the words @entity50 and @entity1 together in the @entity51 and it 's usually because of mass redundancies or a factory being shut			1
of its brands , @entity55 are insipid and to sell in the required volumes they are heavily discounted and sold to rental firms , a killer for models ' retained values that increasingly savvy consumers now consider			0
the decision to import the latest iterations of @entity68 and @entity69 -- cars more worthy of the bowtie badge than the @entity72 and @entity73 we 've currently got , coincided with a @entity1 directive to withdraw @entity65 from the @entity51 by the end of 2015			1
to calm a nervy dealer network , prices in january were slashed by up to 42 %			0
you could buy a @entity81 seven - seat suv for Â £ 12,295 ( $ 20,460 ) , the sort of money that barely buys a decently equipped three - door @entity84			0
unsurprisingly at that sort of money dealers have n't struggled			0
@entity65 's february sales were up 114 % proving what @entity89 firms have known all along : workmanlike products will sell if priced correctly			0
twenty years ago , @entity1 became the first major car manufacturer in the modern era to mass produce an electric car			1
it wanted to prove the viability of the project by inviting drivers to become one of 50 to lease the impact electric vehicle			0
the project leader anticipated 80 applicants			0
in @entity105 there were 10,000			0
there was evidently an appetite for electric cars			0
management admits that now its zero and low emissions vehicle technologies have fallen behind rivals			0
defeat from the jaws of victory and symptomatic of a company lacking the vision now required to compete at the cutting edge of car manufacturing			2
@entity1 used to own @entity121 car firm @entity120			1
in 2008 it finished development on the @entity123 , a competent suv designed primarily for the @entity22 market			0
it was the sort of car that should turn a decent profit margin , perfect to help re-fill a cash - strapped company 's depleted coffers			2
@entity1 did n't launch the car until 2011			1
three years can be more than half a car 's life : the 9 - @entity123 was past - it before anyone outside @entity1 and @entity120 even drove it			1
you can almost hear the mirth from boardrooms in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and even @entity141			0
but could that be @entity1 's salvation ? as a @entity143 who has watched an entire car industry slip into foreign hands i can tell you overseas ownership has n't been too bad at making viable businesses out of @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
a fresh culture could be equally positive for @entity157 management teams have had their chance and at least 13 people have lost their lives			2
@entity1 might be too big to die			2
it 's not too big to be run properly by a foreign company			1

@entity171 says @entity1 has multiple problems and none of them is new
lack of positive image and identity is one of them , he *writes*
