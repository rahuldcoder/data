@entity0 says he was n't elected to the @entity1 to stay quiet			1
and his refusal upon entering @entity3 to observe its protocol to sit back and learn like a freshman , as expected , rubbed some of his more senior colleagues the wrong way			0
and while he has angered much of his party over his crusade against president @entity12 's health care law and the potential government shutdown it could cause , @entity0 says he 's standing for the same principles that got him elected			1
on tuesday , he took that edict to the @entity1 floor in support of his plan to defund @entity20 , saying he would speak " until i am no longer able to stand			1
" but his marathon appearance will not do anything to block @entity20 funding with a key procedural vote on the issue still scheduled for wednesday			1
instead , @entity0 said his speech was to simply " make @entity27 listen			1
" critics question his motives , though â € ” is this about his principles or about presidential aspirations ? @entity34 political analyst @entity33 said his @entity36 detractors think @entity0 is putting his political career above all else			2
" while many others have , no doubt , come to the @entity1 in the past as a springboard to the presidency , it 's hard to recall someone who has created as much controversy within his own party , " @entity33 said			1
@entity0 has been in @entity27 for less than a year , but his short stint has been an effective lesson in partisan politics			2
only history will tell , however , if his tactics will be worth repeating			0
the @entity53 @entity36 's counterparts in the @entity54 have tried 42 times to roll back @entity20 , but their efforts have gone nowhere in the @entity57 - controlled @entity1			1
@entity0 has upped the ante			1
his latest battle to disrupt @entity20 is tied to funding the government in the new fiscal year that starts on october 1			1
the @entity54 passed the measure last week			0
but @entity1 @entity57 are not about to allow the health care bill to be unraveled , therefore putting at risk a government shutdown			1
@entity0 's refusal to give up the fight has rankled many of his fellow republicans , widening divisions in a splintered party			1
democrats , meanwhile , are sitting back and watching the intraparty fight			0
who is this guy ? his effectiveness at political debate has landed @entity0 in many successful places			2
he was elected to the @entity1 in 2012 , after rebuking the @entity36 establishment and winning the @entity36 primary , paving the way to a general election victory			1
previously , he was the youngest solicitor general of @entity53 and has argued multiple cases before the @entity84			0
he got his start at @entity86 as head of the debate team and then honed his skill at @entity90			0
what 's his fight ? @entity0 did not take his @entity1 responsibilities lightly			1
as a freshman , he refused to stand on the sidelines until he 's gained a measure of seniority , a common tradition in @entity27			0
instead , he was loud and opinionated			0
" i find it amusing that those in @entity27 are puzzled when someone actually does what they said they would do , " @entity0 told @entity34 in february			2
" at the end of the day , i was elected to represent 26 million @entity105 and to speak the truth			0
you know , i think a lot of @entity109 are tired of politicians in @entity27 in both parties who play games			0
@entity0 was elected , promising to shrink government , especially the new health care law			1
that battle has been embraced by most @entity36 in @entity3 , but his latest tactic has frustrated many			2
political novice ... ? @entity120 rep. @entity119 has been an outspoken critic of @entity0 ' latest crusade â € ” at one point calling him a " fraud			1
" " whether it 's @entity125 , whether it 's kamikaze , or whether it 's @entity126 or whatever , we are going to lose this , " the @entity120 @entity36 said on @entity34 's " @entity124 " last week			0
and @entity129 sen. @entity129 of @entity130 tweeted that he " did n't go to @entity90 or @entity86 " but that he " can count " that @entity57 outnumber @entity36 in the @entity1			2
but @entity0 said to let his critics talk			2
" if you get outside of @entity27 , there is a frustration with @entity27 that is palpable			0
when you ask your constituents what are the problems you 're facing , over and over again , the answer that comes back is @entity20 is killing jobs , is taking away my health insurance , is driving up my premiums , is causing small businesses to shrink , to go out of business			2
if we listen to the @entity109 people , that should be our priorities , " he told @entity34 this week			0
still , republicans are frustrated by his insistence at fighting a divisive , losing battle			0
' do n't break filibuster ' " we are giving @entity12 the escape out , " @entity36 strategist @entity152 said on @entity34 's ' @entity153			0
' " instead of now focusing on the problems with @entity20 , everybody 's focused on the civil war in the @entity36			2
" @entity158 also noted that the numerous polls , including @entity34 's latest poll , that while the public is concerned with @entity20 , they do n't support shutting down the government over it			1
" if you want to fix @entity20 or repeal it or fix it or change it , the best way to do it is to elect more republicans			2
and the political cost of a government shutdown is really going to affect any -- any possibility of electing more republicans , " @entity158 added			1
... or political genius ? while @entity0 is ruffling the feathers of his colleagues in @entity27 , he is mobilizing the grassroots outside the @entity176			2
conservative groups are praising @entity0			2
" senator @entity0 came to @entity27 to advance conservative policies , not play by the same old rules that have relegated conservatives , and their ideas , to the back bench , " @entity178 , president of @entity179 , recently said about @entity0			1
his group helps activate grass roots republicans for conservative candidates and political causes			0
and @entity36 candidates running against @entity36 incumbents in the primaries are using @entity0 ' crusade in their races			1
@entity194 , who is running for @entity1 to replace top @entity1 @entity36 @entity195 , said in a statement that he would support " conservatives like sen. @entity0 in his fight to defund @entity20			1
" obamacare : can it be stopped ? @entity194 bashed @entity202 for coming out against @entity0 ' effort to shut down the government in order to stop @entity20			1
like so many other crucial fights , @entity195 has caved to ( @entity207 ) @entity208 on @entity20 and is refusing to fight to defund this disastrous legislation			0
" and long - time sen. @entity210 of @entity211 came out in support of @entity0			0
he is facing @entity213 , the daughter of former vice president @entity214 , in a contentious primary			0
will @entity0 be scarred or be a star ? @entity0 could alienate his colleagues to a point where he becomes marginalized and completely ineffective in @entity27			0
he has also hinted at a possible presidential run in 2016			0
if he has no support of the @entity36 , he risks being cut off from its resources and financing			0
on the other hand , @entity0 ' principled stand can help to grow a movement of disenchanted conservative voters			0
if a groundswell of conservative grassroots activists grows between now and 2016 -- and their financial support - @entity0 could have carved out a path to the @entity36 nomination			1
" i think what senator @entity0 understands is that he has more to gain from adhering to his principles , staying in touch with the grass roots here and around the country than he does being friends with other senators , " @entity233 , a leading @entity53 tea party activist who worked to get @entity0 elected , said			1
@entity0 calls for backup plan			0

@entity0 does not play by @entity1 rules , *irritating* traditionalists on both sides of the aisle
*unapologetic* , @entity0 says he was elected to do a job that includes shrinking government
@entity0 ups ante in battle to derail @entity20 , but will he chart new course or *stumble* ?
latest crusade that *threatens* gov't shutdown frustrates many -- including some in his own party
