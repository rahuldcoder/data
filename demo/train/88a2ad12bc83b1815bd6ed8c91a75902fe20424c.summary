@entity0 -- @entity2 is a country where the rule of law is selective and often unjust			1
one source of injustice is the 50 - year - old system known as " laodong jiaoyang , " or re-education through labor			1
under this system , tens of thousands of offenders are imprisoned in @entity2 without trial			1
a @entity13 report estimates that some 190,000 @entity2 were locked up in 320 re-education -- or " laojiao " -- centers in 2009			1
that is in addition to an estimated 1.6 million @entity2 convicted in regular courts and held in the formal prison system			1
the " re-education through labor " system dates back to the 1950s when the newly established communist regime swept up " counter-revolutionaries " and " class enemies " to maintain order			1
today it empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing			1
though the practice is supposedly meant for only minor offenders , critics of the system say it is often used as a tool to persecute government critics , including intellectuals , human rights activists and followers of banned spiritual groups like the @entity46 , and is a major source of human rights violations			1
professor @entity49 , a scholar at the @entity50 , a government think - tank , acknowledged that the system " has played a certain role in maintaining social order and in preventing and reducing crime			2
" however , he added , " as a compulsory re-education administrative measure , it is against the concept of law , lacks legal basis and is contrary to the principles of fairness and justice			2
it will cause political consequences if this system is not abolished			2
" @entity0 officials say some rethinking is underway			2
in a press conference last week , @entity69 , a senior official of a government taskforce on judicial reform , said the government was preparing to revamp but not abolish the system			1
@entity2 society , @entity69 said , has " reached a consensus on the need to reform the re-education through labor system			1
" opinion on @entity2 social media confirms that			1
on the @entity85 micro-blogging site , an informal poll last week showed 97 % of the nearly 13,000 respondents voted that " the laojiao system must be rescinded			2
" only 3 % opined that it is " very good , very practical and must not be rescinded			0
" public criticism of the practice resurfaced last august after @entity91 , a woman in @entity93 province , was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp after she agitated for justice for her 11 - year - old daughter who was allegedly abducted , raped and forced into prostitution by seven men			2
@entity91 's plight earned support among lawyers , intellectuals , bloggers and even the mainstream media			2
ten lawyers wrote an open letter to government agencies , arguing that the system was neither transparent nor well - supervised			2
" current regulations do not require the laojiao management committees to release a written verdict to explain how their decisions were made , so it 's difficult to know if a decision was fair , " complained co-signatory @entity109 , a @entity0 lawyer			0
within a week , @entity91 was released			0
@entity116 , a @entity117 law professor , supports the reassessment of the laojiao system			0
" the way it 's implemented , looking at the deprivation and restriction of the citizens ' personal freedom and the lack of openness , fairness and impartiality and procedural safeguards , the system itself needs to be reformed			1
" @entity2 ex-convicts who have survived years in laojiao camps have bitter memories			1
" it was physically exhausting and psychologically tough because isolation and starvation are always part of daily life , " recalled a government functionary who was jailed for four years			1
in the camp , he said he was assigned to work in a vehicle - repair workshop			0
does the system work in re-educating convicts ? " it 's hard to say , " he said			1
" different people take different lessons from their experiences , but most people leave the camp still hating the system or the government			0
" reform is always a good idea , but you can not do it without changing the whole legal system			0
" reformers propose the abolition of the laojiao system , but hardly anyone expects that to happen soon			0
the @entity2 leadership remains divided about law reform and other aspects of political reform			1
faced with growing social unrest and political instability , @entity2 's leaders have increasingly relied on criminal and administrative punishment to contain rising demands for social justice , clean government , political transparency and accountability , especially among those left behind and marginalized			1
some legal experts agree that the system will take some time to change			0
" the laojiao system should not be completely abolished , " said @entity177 , professor at @entity117			0
" instead it should be adapted and reconstituted			0
we need to take into account the protection of social order and maintenance of social stability			0
" a microblogger named @entity187 agreed and tweeted : " if re-education through labor is abolished , you will see more gangsters around the neighborhoods			1
" @entity193 , a professor at @entity194 , likened the laojiao system to an ax			0
" the ax may serve as a weapon , but we need not destroy all the axes , " @entity193 said			0
" the key is to supervise the hand that holds it			0
" but @entity49 , the researcher at the @entity50 , unequivocally rejects the laojiao system			0
" it goes against the legal system , undermines the law and harms social justice , " he posted on social media			0
" it serves as the local authorities ' tool of reprisal in the name of maintaining stability			0
it has to be abolished immediately			0
" @entity2 - watcher @entity215 said the planned reform of the system was " long overdue " but would proceed gradually			1
" as with most reforms in @entity2 , the policy thrust is to be cautious and experiment first both for people to get used to the change and then to assess whether it has been successful , " @entity215 , a professor of international affairs at @entity219 , explained			2
" i would imagine it will lead over time to its abolition			0
