@entity0 -- for at least three undecided voters , both candidates left an impression during wednesday 's debate			1
@entity6 , they said , came to play			2
@entity8 , they said , let them down			2
until late on october 3 , @entity10 , 41 , of @entity11 , leaned toward the president			0
but @entity8 's " disinterested " performance in the debate in @entity15 left him concerned			1
@entity10 said @entity8 was n't on point			1
" as the president of the @entity18 , i hate to say it , no rest for the weary , " said @entity10 , who voted for @entity8 in 2008			2
" if he 's not sharp in the debate ... what 's he going to be like behind closed doors ? " @entity24 , 66 , a @entity25 retiree , said @entity6 impressed him			1
" i was impressed , as many people were with mr. @entity6 's debating skills , " @entity24 said			2
" i thought the president for whatever reason was not on his game			0
" but polls show @entity10 and @entity24 are n't alone in their assessment of the candidates ' performances			2
unemployment rate below 8 % a boon for @entity8 , but @entity6 says not enough according to a @entity1 / @entity40 survey taken just after the debate , 67 % of registered voters who watched the debate said that the @entity6 won the contest			1
one in four said @entity8 won the 90 - minute event			2
" no presidential candidate has topped 60 % in that question since it was first asked in 1984 , " says @entity1 polling director @entity44			0
with the candidates neck - and - neck in national polls ahead of the debate , any edge is valuable , especially with undecided voters who make up somewhere between 3 % and 8 % of the electorate			1
" they 're important because with voters on both sides seemingly unwilling to switch teams , " @entity56 , a @entity57 strategist and partner at @entity59 , said , " these last undecided voters -- let 's call them the " 6 % " , will put either candidate over the top whenever they decide to break one way or the other			1
" a battleground poll of likely @entity25 voters taken ahead of the debate shows @entity8 leading @entity6 by two points with six percent undecided in the state			1
a similar poll in battleground state , @entity75 shows @entity8 leading @entity6 by two points with three percent of likely voters undecided			1
polling for undecided voters post-debate is not available			1
but will the candidates ' performances make a difference in the election ? @entity10 says it kept his vote up for grabs			2
" i 've been undecided for the longest time , " @entity10 said			0
" for the past month to six weeks i 've been leaning toward @entity8			2
" @entity10 said he was looking for @entity8 to nail down his vote during the debate			1
@entity8 , @entity10 said , did n't deliver			1
in the final days of campaign , it 's all about the slivers of voters another undecided voter , @entity92 , 26 , a @entity93 law student , voted for @entity8 in 2008			1
the @entity95 resident said ahead of the debate that he was completely neutral , but the candidates ' face off pushed him toward @entity6			1
" i 'm not happy with what @entity8 did in the past four years , " @entity92 said			2
" i think @entity6 is a viable alternative , but i do n't know what he would do specifically			1
" but he said nothing in the debate would have changed his mind " besides some extreme event like a major meltdown " by either candidate			0
in the history of televised presidential debates , only two have shifted the tide of an election -- 1960 and 2000 , according to a @entity114 analysis			0
those elections , @entity114 explains , were close -- like the election this year			0
wednesday 's debate impacted voters but it is n't likely to alter the tide			1
the debate " kept both of them squarely tied , so it did n't sway the campaign either way , " said @entity121 , dean of the @entity122 at the @entity123 , site of the debate			2
instead , voters say they are looking toward the next three debates -- two presidential and one vice presidential -- to make a decision and to clear up their concerns			0
@entity10 says that he is worried @entity6 will revert to the policies of @entity139			2
" it scares me to stick the @entity141 back in there			0
he also added that at this point in the election , he 's watching out for mistakes -- because consistency matters			0
" i hate saying this ... but i am waiting for a gaffe from one of them to say , ' oh my goodness , this is the straw that broke the camel 's back			0
' " @entity24 is looking for someone who can corral @entity156			0
" i think that the president , while it 's an important position , is not the problem here			0
it 's the @entity156 that 's the problem , " @entity24 said			0
" and you 've got to have a leader who is going to be able to abandon their extreme ideas and come together on a compromise on those positions , for instance , the national debt			0
" that was fast : @entity6 debate remarks in new @entity8 ad @entity92 wants fewer anecdotal stories , negative political sparring , and more logic and facts			1
" the person who is going to lead the free world is making low blows on stage ? " @entity92 asked			0
" that would lose my vote			0
" and what comes up in the next round of debates could be significant			0
" the second and the third debate become more critical in the minds of the undecided voters , " @entity121 said			1
those debates could bring up some of the more " volatile " issues that were n't talked about wednesday night , she said			0
" there were n't any social issues introduced , " which affect important voting blocs of women and @entity194 in swing states like @entity196 , @entity121 said			0
undecided voters who tend to vote wait until the last minute to cast their ballots , said @entity200 , professor of government at @entity202			1
" if you do n't have to buy a new cell phone for another month , you probably wo n't buy it today , " @entity200 said			0
but for @entity10 , because of the debate , he says he could n't vote today			1
" if you had me pencil in a vote today , i could n't tell you who i was going to vote for			1
" @entity210 : the ultimate undecided voter is in the @entity212			0
