@entity0 , @entity1 -- demonstrators entered their third day of a building takeover at @entity5 on saturday in protest of a tuition increase , an undertaking that a school spokesman called futile			1
the occupation of @entity11 is just one of several demonstrations across @entity15 campuses this week after the regent 's board approved a 32 percent increase in tuition thursday			0
@entity15 officials said the $ 505 million to be raised by the tuition increases is needed to prevent even deeper cuts than those already made due to @entity1 's persistent financial crisis			1
protesting students said the increase will hurt working and middle - class students who benefit from state - funded education			2
on the @entity5 campus , where building occupations began last week with a library sit - in , about 100 students staged a sit - in in the second - floor lobby of @entity11 soon after hearing that the tuition increase had been approved , according to @entity5 provost @entity37			1
the students made a list of 20 " demands " detailing how they want the administration to increase funding , spokesman @entity38 said			1
but the school has no plans to negotiate the demands with the student body , he said			2
the school just does n't have the money , he added			0
school officials hope the students realize that their demonstration is " not accomplishing anything " and is " just a disruption " to administrative duties on campus , he said			1
the administration will continue to wait out the takeover , but @entity38 said he is unsure of how long it will last			1
the school hopes the students will leave voluntarily , he said			0
