@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 should be allowed to leave @entity5 champions @entity4 for @entity6 if he wants , says @entity8 president @entity7			1
@entity4 made a formal complaint to @entity8 about @entity6 's interest in @entity3 last month			1
questioned about the protracted wrangle over the 23 - year - old 's future , @entity7 told @entity13 that the practice of binding players to lengthy contracts amounts to " modern slavery "			1
@entity3 himself later agreed with @entity7 's assessment of his transfer standoff with @entity4			1
@entity4 have vowed not to sell their star winger to @entity6 , but @entity3 has spoken of his desire to join the @entity24 champions -- although he is yet to submit a transfer request			1
he told @entity28 broadcaster @entity26 : " you know what i said , what i want and what i would like			0
let 's see , i agree completely with the president of @entity8			1
now i have to wait and see , but i do not know where i will begin the season			0
" @entity3 also added that he will be sidelined for 10 or 12 weeks while he recovers from monday 's surgery on his right ankle			2
the @entity28 winger 's future at @entity40 has been the source of heated speculation , with @entity24 giants real making clear they want to sign him at any cost			0
@entity4 made a formal complaint to @entity8 about @entity6 's interest last month , but football 's governing body said that no regulations had been broken			1
" i 'm always in favor of protecting the player , and if the player wants to leave , let him leave , " said @entity7			1
" if the player wants to play somewhere else , then a solution should be found because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then it 's not good for the player and for the club			0
" @entity3 , who hit 42 goals for @entity4 last season , has a contract until 2012 and @entity7 believes the issue raises concerns about the way transfers and contracts are dealt with in the game			1
he said he was " very in sympathy " with @entity3 over his current position			2
" i think in football there 's too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there , and putting them somewhere , " he added			1
" we are trying now to intervene in such cases			0
the reaction to the @entity81 law is to make long - lasting contacts in order to keep the players and then if he wants to leave , then there is only one solution , he has to pay his contract			1
" a @entity4 spokesperson told @entity88 : " all our players -- like at other clubs -- enter into their contracts after an open and free negotiation			1
" most of whom do after taking advice from a @entity8 - registered agent			2
many do so on a number of occasions and enjoy long and successful stays at @entity40			2
" @entity101 have warned that players are becoming ever more powerful as a consequence of the @entity105 ruling -- and played down @entity7 's suggestions they are slaves to clubs			1
communications director @entity108 , who also serves as special advisor to @entity101 president @entity110 , gave a different point of view and claimed salaries are " spiralling out of control "			2
" it would be useful to remind people that slaves in all of the slavery systems never earned a wage , " @entity108 told @entity115			0
the @entity105 ruling came into effect in 1995 , allowing players free transfers at the end of contracts , and those coming to the conclusion of their deals have become prey for other clubs			2
" it seems that both clubs and players are trying to negotiate an exit before the player is free , " said @entity108			0
" it is a consequence of the @entity105 ruling -- there is nothing we can do about that			0
" it is obvious that today players have a lot more power than they did 20 years ago , undoubtedly , and agents have a lot more power than they did 20 years ago			0
it is true that salaries are spiralling out of control			0
many clubs have pointed that out			0
" @entity7 went on to dismiss the @entity155 's much - criticised ' 39th step ' proposals , insisting plans to play competitive matches overseas -- either in the league or domestic cups -- was doomed to fail			2
he said : " the 39th game as presented will never happen			0
to my knowledge what they ( the @entity155 ) want to do is perhaps to play some of the @entity164 matches somewhere outside of @entity0			0
that 's the last information i got			0

@entity3 should be allowed to leave @entity4 says @entity8 chief
binding players to long deals amounts to " modern slavery " says @entity7
@entity3 was later *quoted* as saying : " i agree completely with @entity8 president "
