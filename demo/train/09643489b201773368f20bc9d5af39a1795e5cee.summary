in the dead of night , in the bohemian @entity2 district of @entity3 , a " guerrilla " street artist is about to start work			1
in his day job as a professional photographer he has been in riots where rocks and iron bars were being thrown			0
that has given him an almost innate sense of detecting danger , but as long as he is careful and quick , this particular installation should pass off without incident			0
he lurks in the shadows on @entity20 , near the junction of @entity22 with the tools he needs -- two stencils and two cans of aerosol paint , one black and one yellow			0
one last time , he glances up and down the street , making sure that " @entity30 " -- the name given to the @entity34 's @entity33 vehicles -- are not cruising nearby			2
with the coast clear , he gets down to work			0
ten minutes later it is done			0
he breathes a sigh of relief and steps back to admire his latest masterpiece			0
it is a stenciled image of fallen @entity43 hero @entity42			1
the @entity44 is depicted wearing that iconic yellow @entity48 leader 's jersey aerodynamically hunched over the handlebars of his bike			0
but something jars -- poking out of the disgraced cyclist 's back is an intravenous drip , a graphic reference to the 41 - year - old 's doping past that has finally caught up with him			0
@entity42 admits doping ' are there any heroes anymore ? ' in infamy , just as he did in fame , @entity42 continues to hold powerful sway over the public 's consciousness			2
over many years he had vehemently denied cheating as he bestrode the world of cycling in the process of winning seven successive @entity48 titles -- now taken away from him -- until confessing to @entity72 that he had used performance - enhancing drugs and had illicit blood transfusions			0
the credits had barely rolled on that interview before reports of book deals and film rights of his spectacular fall from grace began to emerge			2
now @entity42 has been immortalized in a piece of street art -- named " are there any heroes anymore ? " -- which is reminiscent of the subversive and polarizing exhibits of @entity90 graffiti artist @entity89 at his very best			1
" i was a keen cyclist , cycling three or four days weeks and doing a 90 - kilometer ride on a sunday , " the work 's creator " @entity93 " told @entity94 , explaining why he was moved to labor for several hours in his spare time with his scalpel to produce the two stencils that were used to create the @entity42 exhibit			1
" @entity42 was the ultimate cycling hero for me			2
he took cycling out of the geek enthusiast arena and brought it to a mainstream audience			0
people bought bikes and wore lycra because of @entity42 's profile , success and status , " says the 48 - year - old , who is also from @entity90 but moved to @entity42 in 2007			1
" i was following the story right from the start of the early drug allegations , and in conversations with friends , i 'd support @entity42 and tell them that he was just an just an exceptional cyclist , genetically designed that way			2
" i felt let down by @entity42 -- as i 'm sure fellow cyclists , sportsmen and the general public did			2
i wanted to convey that by a piece of art. " " @entity93 , " who chose that tag due to his atheism , previously ran a news photography agency in @entity127 that dealt with @entity90 's major newspapers -- hence his experience of covering riots			1
he continued to work as a photographer in the @entity43 but inspired by @entity89 -- his favorite image by the notoriously reclusive @entity136 is " @entity144 " -- he began to experiment with stencils , scalpels and aerosol cans in homage to a subculture that began on the streets of @entity143 in the 1970s			1
" the art is in the message -- it 's not about the technical quality of the piece , " said the 48 - year - old			0
" i like the simplicity of conveying a quite deep political or cultural message			0
" staying out of jail caution is the watchword when " @entity93 " heads out to pursue his alter ego 's creative impulses			2
" graffiti artists can face a $ 6,000 fine and imprisonment , and for multiple offenses it can lead to a federal court , which is very bad news , " says the artist , who has never been caught when daubing his impressions on @entity42 's walls			1
from graffiti to galleries : street vs. public art despite the risks , he loves his art so much he is considering giving up his day job as a photographer , though that depends on whether there is a demand for his work and " if i can stay out of jail			1
" his latest creation has already featured in the @entity180 as well as two @entity90 national newspapers , while the media coverage has led -- more bizarrely -- to two marriage proposals on @entity184			1
" ' @entity187 ? ' has been creating quite a buzz , " says @entity185 , editor - in - chief of the street art blog @entity22 and @entity3			0
" it could be said that ' plastic jesus ' is becoming the @entity89 of @entity42 " and , just as @entity89 has had problems with local councils cleaning up areas covered in his artwork , you might have to be quick if you want to see the latest message from " @entity93			1
" the owner of this particular wall , which is also a favored spot for other @entity42 street artists , whitewashes the graffiti away every so often ...			1
