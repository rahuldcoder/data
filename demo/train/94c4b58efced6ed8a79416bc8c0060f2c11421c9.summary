-- call it the @entity2 -- the most valuable power outage			1
for 35 bewildering minutes sunday night , the @entity2 showdown between the @entity5 and the @entity6 ground to a halt when half of the lights in the @entity10 went out			1
players stretched on the field			2
the more than 71,000 fans in attendance did the wave			0
and with no immediate explanation for the outage , social media lit up			1
from @entity20 to @entity21 , from @entity22 to @entity23 , it seemed just about everywhere in the social media - sphere somebody had something to say -- sometimes funny , sometimes not so much -- about what became known online as " the blackout bowl			1
" there were even those who felt forced to say something about being , well , forced to say something			0
" the worst part about this power outage is that people at parties were forced to talk to each other , " @entity32 , a writer for the @entity34 show " @entity40 , " tweeted			1
the brand bowl within four minutes of the outage , advertisers had sent out their first tweets			1
the funniest tweets of the @entity2 @entity47 's oreo cookie was among the first to jump on the @entity20 brandwagon , with an ad featuring the cookie on a partially blacked out page			1
" you can still dunk in the dark , " it read			1
the people behind @entity57 laundry detergent went up with a @entity20 ad that read : " we ca n't get your # blackout , but we can get your stains out			1

in fact , the outage was the no. 1 @entity20 - related moment of the @entity2 , generating 231,000 tweets per minute			1

momentum shift @entity10 mayor @entity81 promised answers			0
" in the coming days , i expect a full after action report from all parties involved			0
" the power company said it was n't to blame , and stadium officials apologized but said little else until well after the game			1
and then , in a statement hours later , @entity10 officials said a piece of equipment designed to monitor the electrical load " sensed an abnormality in the system			0
" " once the issue was detected , the sensing equipment operated as designed and opened a breaker , causing power to be partially cut to the @entity10 in order to isolate the issue , " the statement said			1
it still is n't clear what the " abnormality " was -- but more than a few people had their own suspicions			1
a majority on social media blamed it on the fans of the 49ers , who were trailing 28 - to - 6 in the third quarter before the blackout			1
photos began quickly showing up on @entity23 , @entity20 and @entity21 of the so - called hands of a 49ers ' fan reaching into electrical power box to turn off the power , with the words : " they not winning that easy			2
" conspiracy , cried a @entity5 fan on @entity21			0
" if the 49ers win after this , you all know who 's to blame			2
" even @entity127 had something to say about it , tweeting # momentumshift			2
there may be something to it			0
after the power was restored , the 49ers scored three times in just four minutes			2
then again , maybe not			0

the @entity6 won that game against the @entity144 , 20 - 3			0
blame it on @entity146 some said it was the curse of the @entity10 -- despite hosting seven @entity2 games and its more than $ 300 million renovation following @entity151			1
the stadium was built near a cemetery and @entity155 fans have long said it was the reason the team had fared so poorly			0
some on @entity20 and @entity21 joked @entity155 quarterback @entity159 was responsible , pulling the power plug to get even for the team failing to make football 's big show			1
then there were those who pointed to @entity146 , the villain in the @entity166 movie " @entity167			0
" in the movie , @entity146 mines a football field in @entity170 that explodes after a great scoring run by @entity172			0
" investigation confirms not even @entity146 's power outage attempt can save the 49ers , " said one @entity20 user with the handle @entity166			1
@entity179 's wattage the general consensus on social media appeared to be that @entity179 's high - wattage half - time performance was mostly likely to blame for the blackout			1
