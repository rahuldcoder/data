-- @entity4 's @entity3 activity - monitoring wristbands have been failing at an alarming rate			1
three review units have failed during @entity8 testing , numerous complaints of " bricked " units riddle @entity4 's user forums , and the clever health and fitness product currently receives just two out of five stars on @entity16 reviews -- 41 different user reviews were complaining of 23 bricked devices as of press time			1
today , @entity4 ceo @entity20 issued a statement on @entity4 's website explaining the cause of the failures , and offered a comprehensive , perhaps unprecedented , refund program for anyone unhappy with his or her purchase			1
apparently , problems with circuit board capacitors are to blame for the litany of units that have trouble keeping a charge , exhibit erratic data - recording behavior , or just plain stop working			1
@entity20 's message to customers reports the following : " we 've found an issue with two specific capacitors in the power system that affects the ability to hold a charge in some of our bands			2
we 're also fixing an issue with syncing related to the band hardware			2
typically , these issues surface within the first seven to ten days of use			0
the glitches are purely performance related and do not pose any safety risk			0
" when the wristband works properly , it records all your daytime footsteps , and later provides a visual report of your walking , running or hiking activity via a nifty @entity62 app interface			0
you can also set the band to give you " @entity64 " -- gentle vibrations on your wrist that compel you to get out of your seat and take a few steps			0
the up system also offers nighttime sleep monitoring , providing rich visual graphs detailing periods of deep and light sleep			0
well , that 's how the up system operates when working			2
in our experience with three different failed bands , problems ran a frustrating gamut			2
one band issued random vibrations ( even though no reminders were set ) and consistently dropped data before failing to keep a charge , and then dying completely			0
the other two bands simply exhibited syncing failures before bricking for good			0
in his statement , @entity20 says that @entity4 has " temporarily paused production " of the bands , and will once again begin taking orders after the hardware 's technical issues have been resolved			1
@entity4 's vp of @entity95 and strategy @entity96 told @entity98 , " we will bring it back as fast as we can			1
" @entity4 is also offering a " no questions asked " refund program for anyone who 's purchased an up			1
starting tomorrow and running through december 31 , 2012 , consumers who bought their up bands from authorized retailers will be granted full refunds , and -- here 's the big news -- be allowed to keep their bands			2
consumers experiencing hardware problems can also continue to receive replacement bands through @entity4 's existing warranty program			1
in fact , someone can collect a full refund , as well as receive a replacement band as long as the band qualifies under warranty			0
