-- @entity1 has been clubbed into the long grass by @entity3 after the games manufacturer ended its association with the world 's most famous golfer			1
@entity1 , 37 , won the last of his 14 major titles back in 2008 , but this year returned to world @entity9 after replacing @entity11 at the top of the rankings			2
there were 14 editions of the video game bearing his name , which was played by millions of golf fans across the world			1
writing on @entity3 's official website , the company 's vice-president and general manager @entity21 commented : " @entity3 and @entity1 have made a mutual decision to end our partnership , which includes @entity1 's named @entity28 golf game			1
we 've always been big fans of @entity1 and we wish him continued success in all his future endeavors			2
" @entity3 golf fans have always loved authentic courses and players , but they 've also asked for more choice and customization in how and where they play			2
" @entity3 had previously stuck with @entity1 through his acrimonious divorce in august 2010 at a time where several other sponsors severed ties with the @entity42			1
@entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 and @entity46 all withdrew sponsorship or did not renew their deals following the revelations of @entity1 ' infidelity and subsequent divorce from @entity52 -- costing him $ 20 million in earnings			1
from the endorsements he held in 2009 , just two remain : @entity56 , which teamed up with @entity1 when he turned professional in 1996 ; and @entity57 , a plane ownership - sharing company			2
" for most mortal sportsmen , losing the @entity3 deal would constitute a real body blow			0
at an estimated $ 6.2 million a year , it 's a very significant chunk of change , " @entity63 , ceo of @entity64 , told @entity0			0
" however , @entity1 is in a unique category in terms of earning potential from sponsorship deals -- particularly from his sportswear sponsor @entity56 , which ensures he dwarfs the majority of his peers -- in any sport			1
" so i do n't see this news being a source of sleepless nights from a financial perspective			0
however , it might be the cause of concern for the longevity and sustainability of ' @entity84			0
' " according to market tracking company @entity85 , @entity3 sold $ 771 million worth of games boasting the @entity1 name			1
@entity88 , a consulting firm which deals with the gaming market , states that @entity3 made $ 3.79 billion last year -- with its @entity91 and @entity92 games the top sellers			1
but while the loss of the @entity3 partnership should not cause major damage to the @entity1 brand , @entity63 does believe the move remains significant			1
" losing a marquee sponsorship deal says two things : first , he 's no longer the force he once was on the golf course ; and secondly , @entity3 will no doubt be replacing him with someone else , " he said			1
" @entity11 would seem the most obvious choice -- assuming his form picks up			0
so this might be perceived as the first major step in a changing of the guard			0
" losing @entity112 wo n't make much of a dent on @entity1 's bank balance , but it does make a dent on his ubiquity			0
" and that ubiquity is the single biggest reason why he 's able to command such astronomical sponsorship deals			0
" that said , a couple of major wins would surely turn the tide back in his favor			0
" @entity3 started making golf simulation games back in 1990 , with @entity28 golf coming out on @entity128 , @entity129 and the @entity130			2
in 1998 it produced the " @entity131 99 " which became a huge hit on @entity133 and blazed the trail for further success			0
but in recent years @entity3 has begun to take a step back , with the 2010 cover of the game the first to feature another golfer alongside @entity1 -- @entity141 's rising star @entity11			1
a few months later on a newer version it simply showed @entity143 , home of the masters , with no trace of @entity1 on the cover			0
@entity147 joined @entity1 on the front of " @entity149 " in the @entity42 , while @entity150 was used in the latest version .			0

@entity3 will drop the @entity1 name from its next - gen golf games
there have been 14 editions of the @entity1 game
pr *expert* believes @entity1 in unique category when it comes to sponsorship
@entity3 sold $ 771 million worth of games with @entity1 ' name on it
