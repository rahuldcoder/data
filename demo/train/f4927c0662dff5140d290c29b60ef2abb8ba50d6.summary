-- on a quiet august day i lost someone i loved very much			2
her name was @entity4 and she was a mother to me for 15 years			2
her death was sudden and unexpected , and there were still so many things she wanted to do : learn to play the piano , live in @entity10 , see the @entity11			2
i spent a long time full of grief , and then i felt gratitude for the time we had together			2
i thought about death a lot , which brought clarity to my life , the people i want to be with , and the things i want to do			1
but i struggled to maintain this perspective			0
it 's easy to get caught up in the day - to - day and forget what really matters to you			0
i wondered if other people felt the same way			1
over the past few years i 've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils , and chalk			1
this time i wanted to know what was important to the people around me and i wanted a daily reminder to restore perspective			1
so with help from old and new friends , i transformed the side of an abandoned house in my neighborhood in @entity45 into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a grid of the fill - in - the - blank sentence " before i die i want to _ _ _ _ _ _ _			1
" anyone walking by could pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space			2
it was all an experiment and i did n't know what to expect			0
by the next day the wall was entirely filled out and it kept growing : before i die i want to ... sing for millions , see my daughter graduate , eat all the candy and sushi in the world , straddle the @entity64 , be someone 's cavalry , live off the grid , build a school , hold her one more time , abandon all insecurities , be completely myself ... @entity70 : artfully visualizing our humanity people 's responses made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they consoled me during my own tough times			1
this neglected space became a constructive one where we understood our neighbors in new and enlightening ways			0
it also showed us we are not alone in our hopes , fears and struggles as we try to lead fulfilling lives			0
after receiving requests from passionate people around the world , my @entity89 colleagues and i created a toolkit and project site to help people make a wall with their community			1
you can also download all files for free to remix or create your own stencils			0
now over 75 before i die walls have been created in over 10 languages and in over 25 countries , including @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107			1
each wall is unique and reflects the people of that community , and each wall is a tribute to living an examined life			2
and by using a few simple tools like chalkboard paint and chalk , this project shows you do n't need a big budget to make a big impact			2
@entity70 : architecture that senses and responds death is something we 're often discouraged to talk about or even think about : do n't go there			0
you do n't need to think about it until you 're older			0
however , regularly contemplating deathâ € ” as @entity129 and other philosophies encourageâ € ” is a powerful and healthy tool to put daily stresses in their place , re-appreciate the present , and remember what matters most to you			0
thinking about death clarifies your life			0
in our age of increasing distractions , it 's important to find ways to step back , pause , and reflect on our experiences so we make the most of our brief and tender lives			0
it 's not our experiences that define us but what we make of our experiences that defines us as we grow and change			0
@entity70 : three warp - speed architecture tales our public spaces are as profound as we allow them to be			1
our streets , parks , plazas , and subways are for everyone , yet take a quick look at the messages on display and it seems like we only care about sexy beers and fruity shampoos			0
how can our public spaces nourish our well - being and better reflect what matters to us as a community and as individuals ? every passerby is another person full of longing , anxiety , fear , wonder , and wisdom , and there is great power in knowing you are not alone			1
with more ways to share in public space , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us become our best selves			1
