-- on your next trip , you could be checking into a wine cask , a salvaged 727 airplane , or a room where the furniture defies the law of gravity			1
the casks at the @entity10 in the @entity11 once held the equivalent of 19,333 bottles of wine			1
upside - down stay at @entity18 's @entity17 , each of the 30 rooms is weird in its own way			1
the artist - owner , @entity20 , has seen to that			1
one room , the first built , is made to look like a brightly painted medieval town , with an ultra-mini golf course surrounding the castle bed			1
another has furniture attached to the ceiling , another has coffins for beds , and still another has lion cages on stilts ( the web site claims that kids " love to sleep " in them )			2
then there 's the @entity38 , which resembles a prison , complete with a toilet next to the bed -- oh , that @entity44 humor ! 011 - 49/30 - 891 - 90 - 16 , propeller - island.com			2
a place to unwine 'd when they were owned by a @entity50 château , the four enormous casks on the grounds of the @entity10 in the @entity11 held the equivalent of 19,333 bottles of wine			1
now , after some creative recycling , it 's guests rather than booze that mellow out inside the casks			1
the richly worn and airtight oak barrels have two narrow beds , with a small sitting area outside			2
the grounds are quite close to tiny @entity10 's harbor , which was a major port in the @entity65			2
011 - 31/51 - 46 - 81 - 202 , hotel - vrouwevanstavoren.nl			1
a bad trip ( with none of the consequences ) the daughter of @entity72 's number two masterminded the @entity73 and @entity74 , a complex that more than earns its local nickname , the @entity76			2
this lsd nightmare 's three main buildings are @entity81 concrete treehouse - like growths that appear as if they flowed organically out of the ground			2
inside , the walls seem to dissolve into the floor , and right angles are avoided entirely			1
each guest room is built around a different animal theme : the @entity89 has a big - beaked bird standing atop a huge egg , while another has arm - sized ants crawling up the wall			2
the animal theme continues outside -- a large giraffe statue on the property contains a teahouse , and human - size " spider webs " are set up here and there			2
011 - 84/63 - 82 - 20 - 70			2
@entity0 : check out these unusual hotels in a league of its own @entity106 should stay far from @entity107 , named for novelist @entity108 of " @entity110 " fame			2
the 600 - square - foot lodge , a former marine lab , is 21 feet underwater , close to the bottom of the mangrove - filled @entity115 , in @entity117			0
you 'll have to know how to scuba dive to reach your room , and guests without the mandatory certification must take a course at the hotel			1
once you 've reached the lodge , which sleeps up to six , you 'll be close to angelfish , anemones , barracuda , oysters , and other creatures -- each room is equipped with a 42 - inch window , so you do n't need to be suited up to keep an eye on the neighborhood			0
305/451 - 2353 , jul.com			0
crash in a jet plane near a beach that 's within @entity138 , the @entity136 does n't lack for great sights			0
but few are as amazing as its own 727 @entity141 , a salvaged 1965 @entity143 727 - 100 that looks as if it 's crashed into the @entity145 jungle ( it 's actually mounted atop a 50 - foot pillar and reached via a spiral staircase )			1
the jet 's interior was once able to hold up to 125 passengers , but there are few reminders left of its days in the service of @entity156 and @entity158 's @entity157			0
the suite 's two bedrooms , dining area , and sitting room are now covered over entirely in teak to match the surroundings			0
guests can play " spot the toucan " on the small wood deck that sits on top of the right wing			1

your escape pod awaits colored bright - orange for easy visibility , the ' 70s - era escape pods that make up the @entity173 once hung outside oil rigs , ready to be deployed in case of an evacuation			0
recycled by self - proclaimed " garbage architect " @entity179 , the fleet of pods now rotates among different moorings in the @entity11 and elsewhere in @entity183			1
at the moment , two are in the western @entity11 town of @entity187 and another is in the @entity189			1
for a kind of @entity191 - meets - @entity193 twist , opt to book your pod with a disco ball and all the spy 's movies on dvd			0
it 's a super-kitschy nod to a similar pod 's appearance in " @entity203			0
" 011 - 31/641 - 76 - 55 - 60 , capsulehotel.info			0
on the road again imagine how much ground you could cover if you took your bed with you			0
that 's the idea behind @entity209 , a converted 25 - ton truck that 's a true hotel on wheels in @entity213			1
an awning extends out from the truck 's side to provide some @entity217 at lunchtime			0
the " kitchen " comes tricked out with fridges , freezers , and a large convection oven -- on this trip , the restaurant comes with you too , and sometimes nearby cooks are brought in to give guests a taste of the local cuisine			1
your luggage and sleeping quarters are towed behind you , in a trailer that sleeps up to 24			1
with so much flexibility , guests can see @entity213 's back country , far from crowds and sometimes any other people at all			1
the tours , which last from three days up to three months or more , have included horseback riding , vineyard tours , bird watching , and rodeos			0

where the penthouse is a trailer park @entity245 , @entity247 's sleek @entity246 hotel has a surprise on its roof : a fleet of seven @entity252 trailers , six of which were imported from the @entity255 the aluminum - clad " rooms , " which sleep two people , have been done in playful themes that incorporate icons like " @entity260 " ( a blonde wig and a bear suit are available for dress - up ) , and @entity264 and @entity265 ( the room 's white - on - white furnishings include an enormous bed , natch )			1
if you do n't want to stray as far from the trailers ' original looks , there 's the @entity274 model , an @entity276 - era fantasia with chintz , harvest - gold curtains , and flower - covered throw pillows			0

still weird ! meet the giraffes ( from the 2008 edition ) without sacrificing its estate - in - the - country dignity -- or all of it , anyway -- @entity285 in @entity286 , @entity287 , is arranged so that roaming giraffes can poke their heads into any open window or doorway with impunity and lather guests with their sticky , prehensile tongues			1
your guesthouse is their guesthouse , so the silly creatures pop up everywhere , including over the breakfast table , in the lobby , and through the curtains of the five guest rooms for adults			0
