-- unlike @entity2 , other tv networks are n't hoping to attract more than 200 million viewers as the @entity4 unfolds throughout the next 16 days			1
that said , they 're certainly not going to make the ratings game any easier on the @entity2 , which reportedly shelled out $ 1.18 billion for the @entity9 rights to air the games			1
( that 's about $ 286 million more than they paid in 2008			2
) " one of tv 's first great reality shows , " the @entity4 used to be one of the few original programs to air during the summer , said @entity18 , a curator at the @entity19			1
back then , there was hardly any effort to counter program			0
now , with competition shows such as @entity25 's " @entity24 , " @entity27 's " @entity26 " and @entity28 " -- not to mention scripted cable dramas such as " @entity30 " and " @entity31 " that often pull in up to 6 million viewers -- other networks could likely draw a substantial audience during the @entity4			1
it can be challenging for any series to go up against the @entity4 , @entity18 said , but " there is the possibility that if there 's not compelling storylines for the @entity4 , there are some real interesting shows out there ( for people to watch )			1
" one thing is for sure : @entity46 is n't holding back			2
beloved dramas such as @entity49 's " @entity48 , " @entity50 's " @entity31 " and @entity52 's " damages , " which have all embarked on their final seasons , are surely hoping for steady ratings throughout the games			2
" cable is going about business as usual , " said @entity56 , the founding director of the @entity57 for @entity58 and @entity59 at @entity60			0
" there are a lot of table scraps to be gotten			0
" the no. 1 reason broadcast networks " do n't want to completely roll over and play dead during the @entity4 , " @entity56 said , is because they have schedules they want to promote for fall			1
this is a really important time for networks to be promoting new shows , he said , which is why @entity2 plans to premiere pilot episodes for " @entity75 " and " @entity76 " directly after @entity78 coverage on august 8 and 12 , respectively			1
" the real value of the @entity4 is to use it as a venue to promote the upcoming season , " @entity56 said			1
in total , 211 million viewers in the @entity9 tuned in to the @entity84 ( with about 27 million people tuning in each day ) , making it the most - viewed tv event to date , according to @entity88			2
but that 's not always the case			2
between viewers ' fascination with @entity96 , the " magical " opening ceremony and compelling personal storylines , the 2008 games had a lot going for it , @entity18 said			1
" it goes back to the old network formula , " @entity18 added			0
" you need the compelling personality and the storylines			2
and that sort of has to develop			0
obviously four years ago , there were great numbers because of one person , @entity107 , and the series of events and expectations around him			0
" it 's too early to tell if subsequent plots -- such as @entity113 becoming the most decorated @entity78 athlete of all time or @entity117 sprinter @entity116 's record 100 - and 200 - meter dash times -- will develop at the @entity119			0
though there 's already a good deal of buzz surrounding athletes such as 17 - year - old swimmer @entity124 and 16 - year - old gymnast @entity125			0
" both @entity116 and @entity113 are back , but they 're sort of not what they once were , " @entity18 said			0
" you 're going to have to look for other people that not only are fantastic within their individual sports , but that can create that storyline			0
" even @entity2 seems unsure of what to expect , given the network 's conflicting statements regarding its expectations			1
" i know this is going to stun you , but i think these @entity4 will be huge , " @entity139 , @entity2 's president of research , said in a conference call with reporters via the @entity143			1
" without question , they 're going to dominate 17 nights of prime time			0
i believe they will rank in the @entity151 of the most - watched events in television history , with north of 200 million viewers			0
" meanwhile , @entity156 chairman @entity155 said at a june news conference , via @entity158 : " i would love to match those scenarios , though it 's unlikely			0
we are not measuring ourselves against @entity96			0
" despite garnering respectable ratings during the @entity9 trials , it 's difficult to predict how many people will tune in once the @entity4 are underway			1
and while @entity2 will likely take home a gold medal in the ratings game , other networks should n't be counted out of the games .			1

with new original programs , other networks will likely draw a substantial audience
tv , pop culture expert : even the @entity4 needs compelling storylines to *nab* viewers
@entity2 's rivals wo n't " roll over and play dead " because they have schedules to promote for fall
