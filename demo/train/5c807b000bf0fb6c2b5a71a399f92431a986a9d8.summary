-- the first - ever pictures of planets outside the solar system have been released in two studies			1
the box shows a planet orbiting the star @entity7			0
the dot shows the star 's location			0
using the latest techniques in space technology , astronomers at @entity12 and the @entity13 used direct - imaging techniques to capture pictures of four newly discovered planets orbiting stars outside our solar system			1
" after all these years , it 's amazing to have a picture showing not one but three planets , " said physicist @entity22 of the @entity13 in @entity23 , @entity24			2
" the discovery of the @entity30 system is a crucial step on the road to the ultimate detection of another @entity34 , " he said			1
none of the planets is remotely habitable , scientists said			0
both sets of research findings were published thursday in @entity40 , a journal of the @entity42			1
a team of @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 astronomers and physicists , using the @entity50 and @entity51 telescopes on the @entity52 in @entity53 , observed host star @entity30 to find three of the new planets			1
scientists estimate that @entity30 , roughly 1.5 times the size of the sun , is 130 light years from @entity34 in the constellation of @entity60			2
the individual planets in this planetary family are estimated to be seven to 10 times the mass of @entity64			0
astronomers say the star is too faint to detect with the human eye , but observers could probably see it through binoculars or small telescopes			1
" this discovery is the first time we have directly imaged a family of planets around a normal star outside of our solar system , " said @entity72 , the lead astronomer in the @entity13 lab study			1
about the same time , @entity12 astronomers using the orbiting @entity81 surprised the space community by locating a fourth planet			1
@entity12 's newly discovered planet , @entity85 , is estimated to be roughly three times @entity64 's mass and 10.7 billion miles from its host star , @entity7			0
@entity12 's images show @entity7 b orbiting the bright southern star @entity7 , which is said to be 16 times brighter than our sun and 25 light years away in the constellation @entity94 ( @entity95 )			2
" our @entity81 observations were incredibly demanding			2
@entity85 is 1 billion times fainter than the star , " @entity81 astronomer @entity97 said			2
" we began this program in 2001 , and our persistence finally paid off			0
" previous planet - hunting efforts have relied on the traditional doppler , or " wobble , " technique , which works by measuring the gravitational influence a planet exerts on its host , or parent , star			0
by studying these gravitational " tug - of - wars , " astronomers have been able to study a star 's velocity or brightness to infer the presence of a planet			2
ireport.com : are you an aspiring astronomer ? share your photos of space to determine whether the faint objects orbiting @entity30 were indeed planets and not other stars , astronomers studying the three newly discovered planets ( @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 ) compared images from studies conducted in different years			1
in all the documented pictures , the three objects were found to be orbiting in a counter-clockwise direction around @entity30 , proving that they were planets and not just background objects coincidentally aligned in the image			0
according to the the @entity139 , there have been 322 planets found outside our solar system			1
the latest findings bring that total to 326			0
the extrasolar planets found have mostly been gaseous in their composition			0
both studies indicate that direct - imaging techniques can only aid our efforts in one day finding an @entity34 - like planet .			0

astronomers have new images of four likely planets outside @entity34 's solar system
images were recorded by the @entity81 and a telescope in @entity53
the planets are probably too faint to detect with the human eye
research findings published thursday in the journal @entity40
