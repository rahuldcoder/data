the villagers had congregated at the tent , as they often did at the end of the workday , to sit and chat			0
among them were men who sold vegetables or wood			0
others mined or traded minerals used to make alloys like stainless steel			0
they were husbands and fathers , brothers and sons			0
but unlike villagers who might gather like this in many other parts of the world , these men had strange company at their customary get - together			0
they were living in @entity22 , one of @entity25 's thinly governed tribal areas bordering @entity26 and a hotbed of militancy			2
hanging above them in the evening sky were four remotely piloted aircraft			0
without warning , the aircraft unleashed a volley of missiles that struck the tent , killing eight people			0
a few minutes later , after other villagers had approached the wreckage to help the victims , the drones fired again , deepening the carnage			0
by the end , 18 people were dead , including at 14 - year - old boy , and 22 others were wounded , including an 8 - year - old girl			0
" body parts were scattered everywhere			0
bodies without heads and bodies without hands or legs , " said @entity50 , a miner and local resident who had been praying at the time of the first wave of missiles			0
@entity62 to @entity63 : drone strikes ' fueling terrorism ' ' @entity66 ? ' @entity50 's account of the attack in the village of @entity70 in july 2012 , along with those of other witnesses and victims ' relatives , form part of a report released tuesday by @entity77 titled " ' @entity66 ? ' @entity79 drone strikes in @entity25			1
" the report provides detailed information on nine out of 45 drone strikes it says were carried out by the @entity79 in @entity22 between january 2012 and september 2013			1
in some of the attacks , it says , the victims were n't members of militant groups like @entity89 or the @entity90 , but just ordinary civilians , like the workers in @entity70			2
it recounts another strike , in october 2012 , in which a 68 - year - old woman , @entity95 , was blown apart by a drone as she picked vegetables in front of her grandchildren , several of whom were injured in the attack			2
" @entity77 is seriously concerned that these and other strikes have resulted in unlawful killings that may constitute extrajudicial executions or war crimes , " the report said			1
@entity107 , @entity77 's @entity25 researcher , said that while war crimes have possibly been committed , that can not be confirmed without more information from the @entity79 government			1
leaders due to meet made public the day before @entity25 prime minister @entity114 is due to meet @entity79 president @entity116 in @entity117 , the report calls for a series of measures to bring the drone program in line with international law			1
those include conducting impartial investigations into the cases documented , bringing those responsible for human rights violations to justice and offering compensation to civilian victims ' families			0
on tuesday , @entity114 was at the @entity131 in @entity117			0
" recently our political parties in a national conference declared the use of drones is not only a continued violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve at efforts in eliminating terrorism from our country , " @entity114 said			0
" this issue has become a major irritant in our bilateral relationship as well			0
i therefore would stress the need for an end to the drone attacks			2
" @entity114 has previously called for an end to the @entity79 drone program in @entity25 , where it has stirred deep anger , and will raise the issue with @entity116 on wednesday , said @entity155 , a spokesman for the @entity25 @entity156			1
" the government of @entity25 believes drone strikes are against international law and the sovereignty of @entity25 , " @entity155 told @entity157			1
" drone strikes are counterproductive to fighting terrorism			1
" @entity25 wants to persuade the @entity79 to stop using drones , he said			1
" international opinion is against drone strikes , not just here in @entity25 , but in the world , " @entity155 said			1
" this opinion is strengthening			0
" adding to the pressure , @entity169 also released a report on @entity79 drone attacks tuesday -- this one focusing on @entity173			1
@entity174 , a senior counterterrorism researcher for @entity169 , said the group found at least two clear cases of violations of international laws of war , but those did not reach war crimes status			1
the group said four of the six attacks it had investigated " may have violated the laws of war			1
" sources : drone strikes in @entity173 kill 6 , including senior @entity187 leaders lack of @entity79 disclosure based on extensive field research , the reports underlined the difficulties of gathering information on attacks in dangerous areas of @entity25 and @entity173			1
" we found that despite assurances from president @entity116 that ( the @entity79 government is ) doing its utmost to protect civilians from harm , that in fact in many cases it is killing innocent civilians , even dozens of them , if not more , " @entity174 said			2
and both reports noted the @entity79 government 's unwillingness to talk about the cases			2
the lack of information from @entity79 authorities , @entity77 said , makes it impossible " to reach firm conclusions about the context in which the @entity79 drone attacks on @entity95 and on the 18 laborers took place , and therefore their status under international law			1
" @entity221 press secretary @entity220 rejected the idea that the @entity79 has violated any laws			1
" to the extent these reports claim that the @entity79 has acted contrary to international law we would strongly disagree , " he said at a press briefing tuesday			2
" the administration has repeatedly emphasized the extraordinary care that we take to make sure that counterterrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable law			0
" the @entity79 government has said strikes by the unmanned aircraft are a necessary part of the fight against militant groups			2
in may , @entity116 defended the drone program and disclosed the guidelines determining its use			0
he said drones would be deployed only when there is an imminent threat , no hope of capturing the targeted terrorist , " near certainty " that civilians would n't be harmed and " no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat			0
" civilian victims in @entity173 but @entity169 said the evidence it had gathered " strongly suggests " that the strikes in @entity173 it documented " did not adhere " to the policies set out by @entity116			1
the group said the attacks its report covers took place between 2009 and 2013 , killing 82 people , at least 57 of them civilians			0
the strikes ostensibly targeted suspected members of @entity187 ( @entity187 ) , but victims included women , children , truck drivers and other civilians , the report said			0
" at least four of the strikes were carried out by drones , a fifth strike by either drones or warplanes , and a sixth one by cruise missiles releasing cluster munitions , indiscriminate weapons that pose unacceptable dangers to civilians , " it said			0
the report also questioned the military validity of several of the suspected @entity89 operatives targeted			0
fear and polarization both reports describe the climate of fear created by the drones in @entity25 and @entity173 , and the polarizing effect the attacks are having on local populations			1
" the ultimate tragedy is that the drone aircraft the @entity79 deploys over @entity25 now instill the same kind of fear in the people of the @entity300 that was once associated only with @entity89 and the @entity90 , " said the @entity77 report			1
" like other forces operating in the @entity300 , the @entity79 appears to be exploiting the lawless and remote nature of the region to evade accountability for its violations , " it said			2
@entity169 described a similar situation in @entity173			1
" we @entity173 are the ones who pay the price of the ' war on terror , ' " @entity314 , a relative of a cleric and a police officer who were both killed in a drone attack in august 2012 , was quoted as saying in the report			1
" we are caught between a drone on one side and @entity89 on the other			0
" the report warned that " should the @entity79 continue targeted killings in @entity173 without addressing the consequences of killing civilians and taking responsibility for unlawful deaths , it risks further angering many @entity173 and handing another recruiting card to @entity187			1
" ' a dangerous precedent ' the reports set out a list of recommendations , primarily for the @entity79 government , but also for authorities in @entity25 and @entity173			1
more broadly , @entity77 warned that the @entity79 government may be setting a troubling standard in its use of drones that other countries could follow			1
" @entity79 policy and practice on targeted killings and drones are not only of concern in their own right : they also set a dangerous precedent that other states may seek to exploit to avoid responsibility for their own unlawful killings , " the report said			2
in @entity173 , images of the charred , shattered remains of the cleric and policemen killed in august 2012 have circulated in the village where the attack took place , the @entity169 report says			2
" now when villagers see these images , " @entity314 , the relative , was quoted as saying , " they think of @entity79			2
