@entity0 -- dressed in a wet suit , air tanks strapped to his back , poised to head overboard is an image of @entity7 most people would recognize			1
it was a routine the @entity11 explorer and conservationist repeated over and over again , hundreds , perhaps thousands of times over his long and adventure - filled life			2
but less known was that @entity7 was an inventive genius			1
" i remember most that he was enchanted with ideas ... he was almost like a little child , but he was the most creative and imaginative person i 've ever met , " says @entity19 , a close collaborator with @entity7 for more than two decades who also helped him write his autobiography			1
" he made connections that other people were slow to make			0
a scientist who would be involved and have a passion in his work could go to @entity7 and say ' @entity30 ' and @entity7 could skip to ' q ' and understand immediately the intermediary steps , " she said			2
the @entity11 practically invented scuba diving when he developed the regulator valve that made possible breathing air from tanks underwater			1
apart from his scuba equipment , which he called an " aqua lung , " @entity7 was perhaps best known for his underwater photography			1
his stunning documentaries produced for television and cinema had their origins in the adventurer 's childhood curiosity			0
" he was fascinated by film from the time he was a little child -- he actually pinched chemicals from his grandfather 's pharmacy and taught himself how to develop films and he made movies of himself and his friends , " @entity19 said			1
@entity7 's original ambitions were to forge a naval and aviation career , attending the naval academy in @entity55			1
but a serious car accident in which he broke both his arms ended any dreams of becoming a pilot			0
" he was strengthening himself by swimming and he became a naval explorer kind of by default , " @entity19 says			2
if he came to diving by accident , it was a fortunate accident indeed			0
it led @entity7 to a lifelong search to find out what lies beneath the surface of the world 's oceans			1
@entity7 's endless curiosity led him to explore ever more remote , ever deeper waters			1
but he needed something to help withstand high water pressures and capable of maneuvering silently like a diver without disturbing the aquatic life around it			0
submarines could n't work because of the turbulence and danger of their propellers			0
nothing like he had in mind existed , so @entity7 invented it			2
" he had the idea for it at lunch			0
he pulled out a saucer from under a coffee cup and then put another one on top and he said ' something like this , ' and in two weeks he had scientists working on the idea , " @entity19 said			2
with the help of @entity98 from the @entity99 , @entity7 created the " diving saucer , " or the @entity101 as it was formally known -- a two - man submarine which could dive to depths of 350 meters for several hours at a time			1
he very often insisted on testing his new devices and techniques himself , frequently risking his own life in the process			0
" here was a man who took these devices down enormous depths , not having any idea of what would happen and he had to find out for himself			0
so it was really trial and error in a very dangerous sense			0
and he always survived , " @entity19 said			2
but the @entity11 explorer 's vision was not limited to the world of diving			1
he saw the need to take on broader issues especially those concerning the environment and the seas			0
in the 1960s , he campaigned to stop underwater dumping of nuclear waste in the @entity129 and helped restrict commercial whaling in the 1980s , doing his bit to protect the world he so enjoyed exploring			1
" if somebody said : ' what do you expect to see at the bottom of the @entity137 ? ' -- which they were the first to photograph -- he would say : ' if i knew what i expected to see why would i go ? why would i even look ? ' so it was ' allez voir , ' " @entity19 says			0
" @entity147 voir " ( " go see " ) was advice that @entity7 himself followed right until the end .			0

@entity7 allied an inventive genius to his exploring and photography skills
@entity7 collaborator , @entity19 remembers the @entity11 's contributions to marine exploration
@entity7 helped design the " diving saucer " which helped further *knowledge* of ocean depths
@entity161 also campaigned to stop nuclear waste being dumped in the @entity129 in 1960s
