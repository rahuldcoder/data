-- at every international airshow , there 's a race to garner the most headlines , the most orders , the best visuals and the best sound bites			0
usually , however , @entity9 's @entity8 comes up the winner			2
this is particularly true at the @entity12 ( which starts monday and runs till friday ) , where @entity8 always makes a special push to win the headlines war			1
@entity8 , of course , is headquartered in @entity16 , @entity17 , an hour 's flight south of @entity19			1
government pressure aside from the aggressive competitiveness of @entity8 chief operating officer @entity23 , who ca n't tolerate being second at any time and who rarely misses any opportunity to tweak @entity28 , the @entity17 government is also known to pressure @entity8 to make a great showing			1
@entity28 conceded the point long ago			2
" we know @entity8 sees this as a competition on their home turf			1
in terms of orders , we see this as one week out of 52 , " admits @entity28 's vice president of marketing @entity34 , the company 's most visible communications counterpart to @entity23			1
( @entity23 's actual counterpart , @entity40 , ceo of @entity41 , tends to keep a low profile			0
) " despite the wave of orders our competition rolls out at airshows , the market has still been roughly split down the middle over the past decade , " says @entity34			0
how do you pick up a ' superjumbo ' @entity51 ? high expectations @entity23 declined in a recent interview to predict how many orders he 'll have to announce at the airshow , but skipped the @entity57 international media briefings on june 5 and 6 -- an unusual absence -- to go globe - trotting for orders in time for the show			1
he 's expected to announce hundreds			2
the @entity63 -- the new , composite rival to the @entity65 and aging 777 -- is widely anticipated to make a flyover at this year 's event			0
some question the wisdom of even a flyby , as the @entity63 will have few test flights under its wing at that point			0
@entity8 sends first @entity63 into the sky but the @entity17 government wants to showcase the plane and so does @entity8			1
@entity28 strikes back @entity28 wo n't leave all its pizzazz at home			2
the formal program launch of its 787 - 10 is expected ( although @entity28 wo n't officially say so ) and scores of orders are expected to accompany the announcement			1
@entity84 has already said it will take 30 of the airplanes			0
@entity86 is also presumed to be a launch customer			0
@entity28 is also expected to announce several customers who have signed up for " commitments " for the @entity90 , although the program launch is considered likely for the @entity92 slated for november 17 - 21			1
@entity93 ( headquartered in @entity94 ) is assumed to be a launch customer for as many as 100 of the new version of the venerable airplane			0
thus , with two new airplane programs and hundreds of orders and commitments anticipated , @entity28 could conceivably " win " this year 's show			1
but video footage and pictures of the flyby of the @entity63 will be hard for @entity28 to beat with artist renderings and sound bites			2
how will we travel 10 years from now ? other competitors @entity108 , which makes the popular e-jet in the 70 - 122 seat market , is expected to formally launch its re-engined design of the e- 175/190/195			2
( the 170 appears on its way out			0
) the upgraded e-jet will feature new wings , new systems , geared turbo fan engines by @entity119 and room for an additional eight to 12 passengers			0
@entity108 has been working diligently to line up solid orders to announce at the show			1
@entity125 , on the other hand , does n't traditionally do well at airshows			0
orders for its cseries have been few and far between at these events , in part because @entity133 securities laws require announcements within 24 hours of the signing of even letters of intent , making it virtually impossible for @entity125 to cluster announcements			0
the first flight of the @entity128 will almost certainly miss the airshow , but is expected the next week			0
@entity125 will have to be content talking about tests leading up to the first flight , revealing an unidentified customer 's identify ( possibly @entity144 , based on an executive 's slip of the tongue at an industry event ) and perhaps some small order announcements			1
so , with all this activity , maneuvering and posturing , who will " win " the @entity12 ? @entity8 , of course			1
@entity154 is an aviation writer and managing director of @entity156 , which provides consulting services to the aerospace industry .			0
