the meeting with @entity4 came three days after the @entity69 rescinded an invitation for @entity71 to speak at the @entity72 on the upcoming @entity73			1
the @entity69 decision was because of controversial comments about @entity76 by the younger @entity4			2
@entity4 's statement referred to the upcoming event without mentioning the controversy involving his son			1
" as we approach the @entity73 on may 6 , i want to encourage @entity82 everywhere to pray for our president , and for all those in positions of authority , and especially for the men and women serving in our military , " @entity4 said in the statement			2
in december , @entity71 told @entity2 's @entity92 that " true @entity76 " could not be practiced in @entity11 because " you ca n't beat your wife , you can not murder your children if you think they 've committed adultery or something like that , which they do practice in these other countries			0

the @entity69 , which oversees the @entity73 ceremonies at the @entity72 , feared that if @entity4 spoke at the @entity72 on may 6 , @entity76 militants would publicize his comments , potentially fueling tensions in @entity103 nations such as @entity119 and @entity120 , where @entity11 troops are deployed			1
@entity4 's invitation was not the only controversy swirling about the @entity73 this year			1
last week , a federal judge struck down as unconstitutional the 1952 law that established the day , saying it violated the ban on government - backed religion			0
