" i ca n't not think about the anniversary , " @entity18 told @entity2 at @entity0 's @entity19 , as the team was about to depart			1
" it 's just another weird coincidence that i 'm here on the 7th			2
i 'm flying out to do an absolute dream opportunity and i ca n't get away from the fact that it 's happened on the 7th of the 7th			2
that date seems to be quite significant in my life			0

" i think it 's my duty to go out and live life to the full , really			2
" just a day before the attacks , @entity18 watched with her colleagues on large tv screens as @entity0 was awarded the 2012 @entity73 and @entity10			1
she said she knew her colleagues were watching those same tv screens for news about the bombings a day later as she lay wounded			2

last month , @entity18 won a place on @entity32 's squad , whose members say they 're determined to compete at the @entity37 in two years ' time			1
" it 's a phenomenal achievement because the program is so new , " said team captain @entity130			2
" it 's so exciting to be part of something as new and as promising as i believe our squad is , but quite daunting to think we 're going to be facing teams that are far more experienced than we are			0
" @entity32 's women 's team faces stiff competition in @entity35 from countries like @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity146 countries , @entity130 said			1
vice captain @entity147 said she was feeling the butterflies in her stomach but believed the team could perform well			0
" we 're just a good unit , really , " @entity151 said			0
" we 're all very positive , we all stick together , we 're a nice group , we get on well together			0
so our strength , really , is that we 're all determined to enjoy the games and learn as much as we can			0
" even if the team does n't win , @entity18 said , they 're looking ahead to 2012 and hoping to represent their country on home soil			1
