@entity1 , @entity0 -- the number of stray and abandoned dogs in the @entity4 jumped by 11 percent in the past year -- the biggest surge in a decade -- possibly because of the financial crisis , a @entity4 dog charity said wednesday			1

@entity13 said local authorities picked up 107,228 stray and abandoned dogs from @entity4 streets in the past year			1
it called on the government to make microchipping compulsory for all dogs to help reunite owners with pets , whether lost or abandoned			1
" the latest stray dog survey is very disappointing , " said @entity13 , chief executive of @entity13			1
" even more tragically is the number of dogs that are being put down , which has gone up from 7,000 to just below 10,000 , a very worrying trend			2
" has recession hit your pet ? send us your thoughts the 11 percent rise is the highest yearly increase since recordkeeping began in 1997 , @entity13 said			1
the rise may be due to the financial crisis , @entity13 said			0
some households tighten their belts by giving up the dog			1
another possible reason for the jump : @entity0 and @entity41 last year changed the law to make local councils , not police , responsible for taking in stray dogs , @entity13 said			1
cash - strapped councils might lack resources to pick up or temporarily shelter dogs			2
" you 've got a lot of latchkey dogs that are just left to wander the streets , " said @entity49 , who works at the education center at @entity13			0
" their homes are n't secure , gardens are n't secure , and so they 're just left to wander around			0
" local authorities handle an average of 12 dogs each hour , @entity13 said			0
only five are reunited with their owners -- a number that could increase if more dogs were microchipped , @entity13 said			2
a microchip is an electronic device , coated in plastic , that is the size of a grain of rice			0
it is implanted just under a dog 's skin , beneath its shoulder blades , which causes no harm to the animal and can not be felt , veterinarians and campaigners say			0
the microchip carries the owner 's information , which can be updated			0
the information can be read by a scanner that works through a radio frequency .			0
