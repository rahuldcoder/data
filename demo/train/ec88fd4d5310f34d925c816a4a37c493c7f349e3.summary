-- @entity1 prevented practice for the inaugural @entity3 from being an all - @entity5 affair as he topped the timesheets after the second session			1
with three minutes of the session remaining , and with @entity8 poised to edge out @entity9 at the top of the standings , @entity1 ensured it would be a @entity13 one - two rather than a @entity5 one - two that led the way ahead of sunday 's race			1
conditions for the second 90 - minute period were markedly different to those in the first as outgoing world champion @entity8 pipped new title - holder @entity9 by just 0.096 seconds			1
earlier , as the drivers acclimatised themselves to the new @entity23 , they basked in temperatures of 35 degrees @entity25			0
it was still 31 degrees when the second session began at 5pm local time , but on this occasion the following 90 minutes would be played out under a setting sun for the first time in @entity32 history , and ultimately floodlights as day shifted into night			0
ultimately , it was @entity34 who led the way with a time of one minute 41.307seconds , over 2.5 seconds quicker than @entity8 's best earlier in the day			0
but that was no surprise as the 20 drivers grew accustomed to the track , culminating in the @entity34 ending up quicker than his @entity13 team - mate by just 0.197 seconds , with @entity42 's @entity9 0.234 seconds down on @entity1			1
@entity43 , looking for a small degree of consolation for the year by finishing second to @entity9 in the championship , was fourth quickest in his @entity47 , 0.284 seconds behind @entity1			2
@entity49 's @entity48 , who is deputising for the injured @entity50 , was fifth , followed by @entity52 's @entity51 and @entity47 's @entity53 , winner in @entity55 last time out			0
the top 10 was completed by @entity42 's @entity58 , who himself has designs on finishing runner - up to his team - mate , with @entity64 ' @entity63 ninth and @entity65 in his @entity66 10th			2
@entity68 's @entity67 finished bottom of the timesheets , but that came after blowing an engine after 13 laps			0
that is likely to incur a 10 - place grid penalty for the race as he has already used the permissible eight engines for the season			0
meanwhile , the @entity64 team have confirmed @entity81 will be their new engine supplier from next season			1
after recently ending their contract with @entity49 ahead of schedule , the news is unsurprising as @entity64 have long been touted to again join forces with @entity81 after previously working with them in 2006			2
team principal @entity64 told reporters : " @entity81 have impressed us with the quality of their technical team and convinced us their program will deliver a competitive @entity32 engine			1
" in addition , like @entity64 , @entity81 is an independent company whose owners share our passion for racing and engineering			2
" we believe that , working together , we will develop not only a competitive racing car for 2010 , but also a long - term partnership that can take on the best in @entity32			0
