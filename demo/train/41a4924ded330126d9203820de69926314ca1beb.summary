-- she was named after her mother 's friend and not the doomed @entity5 queen , though at this moment in @entity9 's history , some might think it unfortunate			1
but @entity11 does n't care what people think of her -- it 's her parents ' names that she wants to clear			1
@entity11 , 37 , watched as images of the capture of @entity19 and his wife , @entity20 , flashed across her television screen monday			1
it was difficult for her to see her stepfather and mother appear weak , haggard and , as she says , bearing signs of abuse			2
" it 's disrespectful and humiliating , " she said in a phone interview from her home in @entity29 , where she worked in the @entity9 embassy until february			1
she was n't going to serve a rebel government , she said as defiantly as her stepfather had declared his intention to remain in office			2
so she stopped going to work			2
@entity19 insisted he won @entity9 's disputed november presidential election			1
the international community , however , did not see it that way			1
the @entity40 , the @entity41 , @entity5 and other global powers threw their support behind @entity44 , a man who @entity11 said has haunted her family for many years			1
a four - month political standoff turned bloody and this week , everything ended for @entity19 when forces stormed his residence and detained him , @entity20 and several of his children			2
the grandeur that had graced the @entity54 nation 's first couple quickly faded as @entity44 's security forces took them away -- a tired , feeble man seen on television in a white undershirt and a wife in a sundress and disheveled braids			1
@entity11 was sure her father had been beaten			1
" this is tragic -- not just for my family but for the people of @entity9 , " @entity11 said			1
all her life , she had known parents who she viewed as determined to pull their nation up from the remnants of a brutal colonial history			2
all her life , she had known parents who gave their time for building a multi-party system			2
the well - educated @entity19 -- he earned a @entity75 in history -- stood up to @entity9 's first president , @entity77 , known as the father of the nation			1
@entity19 despised @entity77 's strong alliance with @entity5 , the former colonial power			1
@entity11 recalled a campus protest in the early 1990s in which her stepfather and mother were arrested			1
@entity44 was then @entity77 's prime minister			1
" it has not been easy to be in opposition , " @entity11 said			1
" they have been doing it almost all their lives			2
" so this is nothing new , " she said of this week 's events			1
@entity44 , she said , remains a puppet for the colonialists and international players who want to profit off her nation			2
@entity19 , she said , paid the price for standing his ground			2
" when an @entity54 leader comes and says , ' i want to serve my people , ' they do n't want to hear that , " she said			0
" so from the start they wanted to get president @entity19 out of office			0
" @entity11 has not been back home to @entity9 in two years			1
but she had been calling her parents as they hid in the basement of their residence			0
she worried about their safety , but they said they were fine			0
" it made me proud they are not quitters			0
they are true to the vision for @entity9 ... for independence			0
because we are not independent			0
" but on monday , the phone calls stopped going through			0
she imagined her parents ' phones had been confiscated , cut off even , because she kept hearing a message from the phone company			0
she said she has had no word of her family since their capture			2
there are many who believe @entity19 should stand trial for allegations of human rights violations			0
he may even face investigation by the @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136			0
so on wednesday , @entity11 assembled a legal team that includes @entity138 , who defended @entity140 @entity139 and once offered his services to @entity143 dictator @entity142			1
@entity11 has asked the lawyers to look into the arrest of her family and the legality of the @entity5 army 's intervention			1
she is hopeful the world will eventually see him the way she does			0
the world has called @entity19 a monster			0
@entity11 described him as affable , a man who likes to tell jokes all the time			1
the world has portrayed @entity19 as power - hungry			0
@entity11 said he was modest and humble and loved for those virtues			1
she thought this week of her childhood and how her parents used to insist their children have lunch with them every day			0
at night , her parents dabbled in politics			0
but the midday meal gave them time to delve into the loves and tribulations of their children			0
" they would not start lunch until we came back home , " @entity11 said			1
if she was out at a friend 's house , her father sent someone to fetch her			2
and , if there was no rice at the table , there was no meal , she said			0
she told these stories of her father to explain that her father is the opposite of what he has been made out to be			0
really , she said , he is not complicated			0
she quoted the @entity187 when she said no weapons formed against her parents shall prosper			0
the @entity189 , she said , will take care of her stepfather .			0

@entity11 contradicts the international *potrayal* of @entity194
she describes a loving , affable man who stood up for the good of his country
she has hired a legal team to look into whether his arrest was *illegal*
she is *adamant* about clearing her family 's name
