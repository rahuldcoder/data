@entity0 , the good news			0
news organizations -- including @entity3 , the @entity4 , the @entity5 and @entity6 -- are asking : where are the women ? they 've noticed that president @entity10 's nominees for his national security team and @entity12 , including secretary of state , @entity14 , @entity15 , and director of the cia , have excluded the talent of potential female appointees			1
as co-founders of the @entity21 , whose purpose is to make women more visible and powerful in the media , we want to say thank you for noticing			2
now , the bad news			0
president @entity10 is n't answering			2
he would n't have been re-elected without 55 percent of the women 's vote , something he earned by representing women 's majority views on issues , yet now he seems to be ignoring women 's ability to be not only voters , but leaders			1
fortunately , there are still possibilities			0
a second - term president @entity10 still has time to demonstrate his commitment to equality in a different but equally important area of the federal government , the agencies that have oversight of the media and telecom industries			1
media companies have some of the most powerful resources at their disposal in shaping attitudes and culture			1
but media culture , from our tv shows to advertising , is often deeply sexist and normalizes roles that limit everyone			0
there is a powerful " bully pulpit " effect to having women at the head of these agencies			2
four important agencies regulating media include the @entity67 , the @entity68 , the @entity69 @entity71 's @entity70 and the @entity73 's @entity72			1
one slot has already been filled by a man			0
on january 3 , @entity76 was sworn in as assistant attorney general for the @entity70			0
@entity78 : white men to fill @entity10 's cabinet that could leave three			1
we say " could " because it 's not yet 100 % clear that the heads of the @entity68 or @entity67 will be stepping down , though top appointees do shift around in a president 's second term			1
for instance , there has already been speculation that @entity91 , assistant secretary for communications and information , which manages the @entity72 , is in the running for @entity67 chair			2
why not an equally logical woman 's name ? @entity98 , who has just returned from serving as @entity69 ambassador to the @entity100 , was one of six women called qualified by the @entity102			1
others named as possible @entity67 chairs were @entity67 commissioners @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity110 administration @entity67 executives @entity108 and @entity111 and @entity10 adviser and communications expert @entity107			1
@entity10 's @entity12 shaping up to be a boys club we 're glad to say the @entity67 has had black chairmen			1
@entity117 , for example , made a top priority of closing the digital divide for african - americans and for @entity69 with disabilities			2
it 's unfortunate that there have not been more , though we live in a diverse country in which white @entity69 are about to become the minority			0
never in the 80 years of the @entity67 has a woman of any race or group been its chair , though women have been the nation 's majority for a long time			1
then there 's the @entity68 , which has broad oversight over everything from price fixing at the gas pump to whether @entity137 is a monopoly			0
it includes the @entity139 , which monitors false and deceptive advertising			0
women still have most of the purchasing power in households			0
according to @entity145 's @entity144 , 75 % of women are the primary shoppers for all household products			0
women are more likely to have the expertise for such decisions in the interest of consumers and also to be affected by those decisions			0
as we step into 2013 , @entity69 's media are still largely run by men			1
women hold only 6 % of all tv and radio station licenses			0
it 's long past the time to close the gender gap in our nation 's leadership and in the media and telecom industries ' leadership especially , where in 2011 only 28.4 % of tv news directors were women , according to the @entity21 's 2012 status of women in the @entity169 report			1
we thought president @entity10 wanted women in his inner circle			2
right now , the makeup of that inner circle looks nothing like the country .			0

@entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 : @entity10 short on women appointees
they say women helped him *win* , he must show he sees them as leaders , not just voters
they say media companies shape attitudes . he should name women to head @entity67 , @entity68
*writers* : media is run largely by men . time to close the gender gap in @entity69 media leadership
