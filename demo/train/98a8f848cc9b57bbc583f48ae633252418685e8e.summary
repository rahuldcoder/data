-- she 's been compared to the @entity2 , the @entity4 @entity3 leader , but the name @entity6 does n't ring a bell to many people outside of @entity9			1
@entity6 has been dubbed " the @entity10			1
" nevertheless , the world - famous man and the relatively obscure woman share similarities that chime with political relevance			0
a diminutive northern @entity17 resident , @entity6 has emerged as the voice of the restive but relatively unknown @entity19 , a @entity21 - speaking ethnic minority in @entity9 , and the group 's far - flung diaspora			1
and like the @entity2 , she 's revered by supporters and reviled by the @entity4 government			1
" even though one is a man , and the other is a woman , they have one thing in common , and that is they engage in activities to split the motherland and damage national unity , " said @entity26 , a spokesman for the @entity27			0
@entity6 , 62 , emerged in the world media spotlight after @entity9 blamed her for stoking july 's unrest in @entity9 's remote @entity40 , an area four times the size of @entity42 in the northwestern part of the country			1
reports vary on the number of people killed , ranging from around 200 to many more			0
the problems began in late june , after two uyghur migrant workers at a toy factory in @entity52 province were killed after a brawl between @entity54 and ethnic @entity55 -- the majority group in @entity9			1
@entity54 protested in @entity57 , the @entity40 capital , hundreds of miles from the toy factory			0
uyghurs and @entity55 reportedly attacked each other			0
@entity61 , the @entity4 government 's top official in @entity40 , accused @entity6 and the @entity63 she leads of instigating the unrest via the @entity65			1
" the violence is premeditated , organized violent crime , " @entity61 said			0
" it was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country			0
" @entity9 's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy			1
and the @entity4 government has implemented several programs designed to help ethnic minorities , but @entity6 says @entity9 still treats @entity54 as second - class citizens -- and she blames @entity9 for most of the recent unrest			1
since the violence erupted , @entity6 has worked the media with a mission , drumming up support for the @entity85 cause and shining a light on what she says are @entity9 's " unjust policies " toward her people			1
the estimated size of @entity91 in @entity9 ranges from 8 million to 11 million people , making them a distinct minority in a country of 1.5 billion people			1
@entity54 have long complained of being treated as a lesser class , but @entity9 has dismissed that charge and touted its commitment to ethnic unity			1
" let them hear our voice and raise public awareness about our situation , " @entity6 told @entity0			1
" that 's the main thing that i wish to do right now			0
" dubbed " the @entity10 , " @entity6 does n't quite fit the profile of a political firebrand			1
born in modest circumstances , @entity6 fell into dire poverty amid the late @entity4 communist leader @entity109 's forced relocation programs			1
she worked her way up from laundry worker to become a millionaire businesswoman as @entity9 opened to free enterprise			2
she amassed an empire with department stores , real estate , lumber , scrap iron , factories and other enterprises			0
she was also chosen as a member of a @entity4 @entity123 and other posts			2
however , the mother of 11 children -- some of whom are in jail in @entity9 -- was n't shy about speaking out about the conditions faced by @entity54 , such as political imprisonment			2
her activism landed her in jail in 1999 , an incarceration that attracted international attention and condemnation from rights groups and @entity139 political officials			0
@entity9 released her on medical grounds in 2005 amid pressure from the @entity143 government			1
she was granted political asylum in the @entity143 , reunited with her husband , and embarked on activist work			0
along with her role as president of the @entity63 , @entity6 is the president of the board of the @entity150 and the full - time director of the @entity152			1
those groups receive money from @entity143 taxpayers through the @entity156 , a private , nonprofit organization created " to strengthen democratic institutions " around the world			0
@entity159 , author of the " sons of the @entity161 : the rise of the @entity165 , " describes @entity6 as a skillful and hard - working activist who has done a lot for the @entity54			2
he said she is well - situated in the @entity168 area , where she has easy access to media outlets , and is a " natural focal point " for the uyghur rights cause			0
" she has a canny sense on how to get on top of the situation			0
as long as she can maintain the @entity2 - like profile , she will persist in being a spokeswoman for the @entity54 , " @entity159 said			2
@entity178 , an expert on @entity9 and its ethnic groups , described @entity6 as a significant leader who is a charismatic , determined and maternal figure who can move easily among the elites and the common people			1
she has a message that can unite @entity54 , and @entity9 's criticism of her in some ways has enhanced her stature , said @entity178 , president of @entity189 at @entity190 in @entity42			2
" she seems like somebody all @entity54 can look up to , " he said			0
he noted that her following is " quite remarkable " since she is a woman and both @entity193 and @entity4 cultures are patriarchal			2
she abhors violence and favors peaceful resolution of conflicts , @entity178 said			0
in that respect , she mirrors the non-violent sentiment espoused by the @entity2 , who wrote an introduction to @entity6 's autobiography " @entity201 , " recently published in @entity202			1
" @entity85 and the @entity204 people have a history of relationship and in modern times have shared somewhat similar experiences			0
i therefore hope that this book by mrs. @entity6 will enable the readers to comprehend the experience of the uyghur people , " the @entity2 wrote			1
@entity6 told @entity0 she has had " close communication " with the @entity2			1
she said " our philosophy in peace is the same " and said the movements of both peoples for justice are connected			0
" if the @entity9 have the authority to destroy one of them , they have the authority to destroy the other , " she said			2
@entity9 's state - run @entity226 news agency reported tuesday that @entity4 president @entity230 , in a visit to @entity229 province this week , urged all people to show mutual respect and concern			1
he also said all ethnic minorities are important members of the @entity4 family , the news agency reported in a story that did not specifically mention @entity54			2
the @entity238 of @entity9 and the government plan to emphasize more strongly developing areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and strengthen support to improve their livelihood , according to @entity226 's paraphrasing of @entity230 's remarks			1
in a recent @entity247 essay , " @entity9 's @entity248 , " @entity178 wrote that by the mid- 1980s " official minorities were beginning to receive real benefits from the implementation of several affirmative action programs			2
" they include " permission to have more children ( except in urban areas , minorities are generally not bound by the one - child policy ) , " paying fewer taxes , getting " greater access to public office , " and better education for children -- in @entity4 rather than native tongues			2
@entity6 has spent much of the last few weeks plowing through media interviews and chatting about how she juggles being the " @entity10 " with being a mother to her flesh - and - blood children			2
" my family is very supportive of my activity , " she said through a translator			0
yet she has spent time apart from her husband , also a @entity85 activist , and children because of political ferment and imprisonment			0
@entity6 says this is a " very dark time for the @entity85 people			1
" she condemned @entity4 security forces for killing and injuring uyghur demonstrators this month in @entity57			1
unrest also took place in the cities of @entity283 and @entity284 , she said			0
while she focuses on what she says is the @entity4 crackdown against @entity54 in " @entity287 " -- the name @entity54 use for the region -- she also condemned reported violence by " a number of @entity85 demonstrators			2
" " uyghur demonstrators were doubtless expressing discontent over the severe and comprehensive repression they have suffered for years in @entity287 , " she said			0
she cited " arbitrary detention , torture , and execution " the repression of their religion , " forced abortion and discrimination in several spheres , including health care and employment			0
" in her talks , @entity6 -- who sports braids and a traditional @entity85 dopa cap -- urges @entity9 to " stop the cultural genocide " and " address the legitimate grievances of the @entity85 people			1
" " i do believe that even our enemy would come dine at our table , " she said , " because what we have been doing is in a peaceful way			0
so i do believe that they would come to our table and resolve this			0
