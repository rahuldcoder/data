@entity0 , @entity1 -- for me , the issue of skyrocketing gasoline prices came into focus about four years ago , when the national average that @entity8 paid at the pump reached an all - time high of $ 4.11 a gallon			1
today , the average -- up 30 cents in the last four weeks , and 13 cents in the last week alone -- is about $ 3.70			2
in the summer of 2008 , i pulled up next to a gas pump off a major highway in @entity1 where -- apparently , a few minutes earlier -- a recreational vehicle , which held more than 100 gallons , had stopped to fill up			1
the price was still on the screen : $ 500			2
can you imagine paying $ 500 to put gas in your vehicle ? for many of us , that 's more like a monthly car payment			2
but for those who live in @entity1 -- where the car is king , public transit is spotty and the carpool lane is almost always underused -- even a tab that size hardly raises an eyebrow			2
at the gas station closest to my home in @entity0 , a gallon of gas is going for about $ 3.49 , and a full tank costs me about $ 65			2
i shell that out three or four times a month			0
prices are sky high in @entity41			1
with the average price here expected to reach as much as $ 5 a gallon by @entity46 , it 's not surprising to see more commuters jammed onto trains and hear that more of your friends are trying to work from home a few days a week			0
although my friends on the @entity54 like to think they have it easier with more options for public transportation , it 's a mistake for people to assume that higher gas prices do n't affect them			1
it 's not about geography			0
we 're all in this together			0
have you noticed the price of groceries lately , as those companies that operate delivery trucks have to spend more to stack food on supermarket shelves ? so you do n't own a car			2
maybe you take the subway to work			0
but if you have a mouth , and occasionally like to fill it with food , high gas prices should be hard to swallow			1
meanwhile , political leaders -- in both parties -- need to fill up on courage and common sense in order to work on a solution			0
president @entity82 was right to say recently that there is little a chief executive can do about gas prices			1
that said , presidential candidates should stop promising otherwise			1
at the moment , our politicians seem to be running low on ideas and yet overflowing with an eagerness to exploit the uptick in prices for their own political benefit			2
@entity96 is promising lower prices			1
he also pledges that , if elected president , he wo n't bow before a @entity100 king			0
so what ? what does that have to do with anything , beyond political rhetoric ? at the moment , our main concern -- and certainly that of our one true friend and ally in the @entity111 , @entity112 -- is n't @entity100 but @entity113			1
as part of a small group of @entity118 journalists who visited @entity112 last month , i was reminded by @entity112 officials in one briefing after another that -- were @entity113 to build a nuclear weapon -- the entire world would change			0
@entity113 president @entity124 could block the @entity125 and the rest of the world would be too frightened to do anything about it			0
that 's what we should be worried about , not whether @entity8 presidents bow before the @entity100			0
it also would n't hurt to pay more attention to oil reserves in this hemisphere			2
@entity136 is a major producer , and a friend and ally			1
the relationship between the @entity8 and @entity136 is n't perfect ; tensions recur over immigration , drugs and trade			1
each country has an annoying habit of blaming the other for its problems			0
but it 's a strong marriage that will endure			0
instead of chanting " @entity154 , baby , drill , " more of our leaders should be saying : " @entity155			0
" the @entity8 government should increase oil imports from @entity136			1
not only is it better to deal with friends than adversaries , it 's also a good way to help the @entity136 government fund its war against the drug cartels -- a battle that is , let 's not forget , fueled by another one of our addictions			1
granted , in order for the @entity8 to increase oil imports from @entity136 , our neighbor may have to increase production			1
that 's a slippery situation			0
@entity136 nationalized the oil industry in the 20th century and foreign companies are prohibited from drilling			1
but that resistance seems to be weakening			0
@entity136 's national oil company has allowed some private contracts and says its mature fields , which produce just 12,000 barrels of oil per day , could produce up to 220 million barrels of oil			1
we can have that conversation			0
and let 's face it , the @entity8 would rather work through that issue than work with countries that are hostile to @entity8			0
look at the polls , and you 'll see that one of the major reasons everyday @entity8 think we need to become more energy self - sufficient and develop a better strategy for importing oil is that they 're leery of becoming too dependent on countries in the @entity111 that are often unwelcoming , undemocratic and unstable			2
after all , no matter how much we love our cars and need our gasoline , few things are scarier than breaking down in a bad neighborhood			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : @entity208 are *fatalistic* about high gas prices , and remember 2008
even if you take the *bus* , he says , high gas prices affect the cost of food , other goods
@entity206 says presidential candidates ' promises of lower gas prices are empty rhetoric
he thinks a good move would be *negotiating* to *buy* more oil from @entity136 , a friend and ally
