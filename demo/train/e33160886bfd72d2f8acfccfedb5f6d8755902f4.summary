it 's hard not to be nervous , standing outside the @entity2 isolation wards			1
the wards are a cluster of unassuming white tents in the middle of a large field , not far from the center of the city			1
each is just big enough to hold around 10 cots			2
two layers of zippers keep the outside from getting in , and more importantly here -- the opposite			2
nobody goes inside the tent without spending 15 minutes putting on isolation gear			1
the nurse handing over my garb calls it my " space suit			2
" i ca n't help but think that going into an @entity2 isolation ward is a little bit like going to the moon			1
in @entity31 ' " @entity30 , " seemingly invincible invaders from @entity29 are laid low by @entity33 's microbes , for which they have no defense			2
with @entity2 , we humans are the invaders			1
the sense of being an alien in the world of this virus is jarring			2
outside the tent , the air is sticky and has a distinctive smell of bleach			2
the bleach is in large plastic jugs ; people use it liberally to wash their hands			2
it mixes with the smell of smoke , wafting from an enormous pit in the ground , full of smoldering ashes			2
i am told everything that comes out of these wards is burned : the suits we 're wearing , the sheets off the cots , even the human waste			1
nothing kills better than fire			2
after the 2012 @entity2 outbreak in @entity70 finally ended , medical teams scorched the earth			1
the patients inside the tent are infected with one of the most deadly pathogens in the world			1
@entity2 has no treatment , no vaccine and no cure			1
ebola : what you need to know there are at least five different strains of @entity2 , and in past outbreaks , this virus -- the @entity87 strain -- has killed as many as nine out of 10 people it infects			1
men and women , young and old			2
@entity94 geared up with @entity95 , a physician from @entity96			2
he wants to give me an idea of what it is like to walk in his boots			2
he is with @entity103 , and he has been here for three weeks , almost since the beginning of the outbreak			1
this trip is his first time seeing @entity2			1
" no family at home , " he told me , no one to dissuade him from coming here			2
he seemed a little surprised i even asked			0
in this line of work , having a family is a job liability			0
@entity95 is a different kind of doctor			0
he does n't just care for patients ; he risks his own life to help save theirs			1
sometimes , neither patient nor doctor makes it			0
since the beginning of this @entity2 outbreak , 112 people have died in @entity127 and 13 in neighboring @entity128 ; at least 17 have been health care workers , according to the @entity130 and the @entity131			1
standing outside the tent , i silently remind myself of the science and the facts , to try and calm myself down			0
the virus does not spread through the air and does n't live on surfaces for very long			0
keep your hands to yourself and stay vigilant , i remind my producer @entity141 and cameraman @entity142			0
i 'm reminding myself , too			0
there is a habit i 've had since i was a child			0
i bite my nails when i 'm nervous			0
i stare at my cuticles now ; they look dry and cracked			0
it 's not just unsightly ; it 's a potential threat , a pathway for the virus to enter my body			0
the day before , one of the doctors showed me a small cut on his hand			1
" they grounded me , " he said			0
he was not allowed in the isolation areas , because that simple cut was too big a risk			1
@entity161 : ebola a swift , effective and bloody killer before you go into the isolation ward , you stop in a separate tent to gear up			1
@entity95 and i are in one of these anterooms , dressed in scrubs and thick white rubber boots			0
we are already sweating , and we have n't even begun to put on the " moon " suits			0
it is 100 degrees outside			0
first we slip on a pair of blue latex gloves , then a thick yellow impermeable suit			0
a mask goes on , then a white hood with another mask built into it			0
a pair of large clear goggles is wrapped around the hood and then a large white apron			0
finally , we slip on another pair of latex gloves			0
not a single part of my skin is exposed			0
@entity95 triple - checks to make sure			0
it has to be this way for these doctors and nurses who knowingly expose themselves to @entity2 , dispensing medication , hanging ivs and using needles to draw blood , but you have to wonder what goes through the minds of the patients , seeing these rubber - clad aliens looming in front of them			1
imagine developing a fever , cough and muscle aches and then suddenly being isolated in a ward where your only visitors look like this			0
the patients here are sick and scared			1
the doctors and nurses write their names in large black letters on the aprons , so they can seem slightly more human to the people for which they care			1
it occurs to me that a mask , or two , should n't make a difference since this virus is n't airborne			0
i ask @entity95 , who reminds me that the average person subconsciously touches his or her face a few thousand times a day			0
the masks are reminders that nothing inside this ward is considered safe			0
who : @entity2 outbreak one of ' most challenging ' i am drenched in sweat , and i 've only been in the outer tent for five minutes			1
i 've experienced just a sliver of what goes into making rounds when your patients have @entity2			1
i wait here while @entity95 continues on , inside the quarantined space , to spend about an hour with his patients			1
before leaving the camp , i share all the latest @entity2 figures with @entity95 , and we compare notes			1
instead of the feared 90 % death rate , in this outbreak it 's running closer to 65 %			1
still terrible , no doubt , but also tangible evidence that @entity95 and his team are saving lives			1
still soaked in sweat , he smiles weakly			0
truth is , even he gets a little nervous doing this sort of work			0
but he does it so the people outside these wards , people all over the world , will never know what it 's like to be inside			1

those in @entity2 isolation wards must don isolation gear
doctors are risking their lives to help save their patients , dr. @entity161 says
more than *120* killed in outbreak in @entity127 and @entity128 ; 17 are health care workers
patients in the wards are sick and scared , @entity161 says
