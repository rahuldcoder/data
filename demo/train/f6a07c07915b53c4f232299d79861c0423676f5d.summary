@entity0 -- the partisan impasse over potential contempt proceedings against attorney general @entity4 continues following a lengthy letter from the deputy attorney general , and a blunt response from the @entity9 chairman			1
the latest volley started with a 13 - page letter from @entity4 's deputy , @entity12 , to committee chairman @entity13 , @entity14 , arguing against contempt			0
" a contempt proceeding would be unwarranted given the information the @entity18 has disclosed to the @entity9 to date , " @entity12 wrote			2
he also called such an action " unprecedented " given the law enforcement issues , and " ill - advised " given the damage it would cause to relations between the executive and legislative branches of the government			1
in the letter , @entity12 repeated @entity4 's previous admissions that " @entity33 " was fundamentally flawed as a solution to gun trafficking at the @entity32 border			1
after months of congressional investigations , the @entity18 had acknowledged that its agency , the @entity35 , made a serious tactical error in allowing guns to be purchased by straw buyers and then smuggled across the border to drug cartels			0
what was supposed to be a sting operation turned into a nightmare when about 1,000 firearms went missing during the operation and ended up in the hands of drug lords			2
the fiasco reached crisis proportions when a @entity52 @entity51 agent was slain in @entity53 near the border in december 2010 , and two of the missing weapons were discovered at the scene of the killing			2
republicans in @entity60 have been demanding answers			0
@entity13 wants any document that could shed light on the operation			0
@entity12 says @entity18 has sent tens of thousands of pages of documents , answered all the questions at hearing , and given the committee most of what it wants			0
but @entity13 says that 's not enough			0
" while the @entity9 has subpoenaed documents that address what senior officials were told about controversial gunwalking tactics during @entity33 , the @entity18 pointedly refuses to provide them or to deny senior officials were given information in the course of the @entity82 indicating the existence of reckless tactics , " a spokesman for @entity13 said wedneday			1
@entity86 @entity9 members are expected to reach a decision on voting a contempt citation by the end of may , @entity86 officials say .			1
