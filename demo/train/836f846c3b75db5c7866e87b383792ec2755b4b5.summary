-- as @entity2 debates immigration law , it can not avoid debating citizenship			2
who gets to be a citizen ? and what should citizens know , believe , and do ? under current law , would - be citizens must pass the @entity12 @entity11 , which poses factual questions about civics and history such as : " what are two rights in the @entity18 ? " they must respond with two of the following : life , liberty , or the pursuit of happiness			1
this test assumes that a competent citizen knows some basic information about the @entity12 political system			1
most @entity12 students must demonstrate similar competence			1
all @entity12 states have standards for @entity33 social studies and , typically , the teacher assesses knowledge with paper - and - pencil tests that resemble the naturalization test			1
one question is whether these requirements reflect a worthy definition of citizenship			2
should we insist on knowing generalized facts but not , for example , skills for working with other people , or values such as a commitment to other people 's rights ? another question is whether studying for short - answer tests teaches people much			1
someone could study for the naturalization test by memorizing phrases without understanding at all what they mean			2
the @entity60 provides online flashcards to help , and the same is true of multiple choice civics tests in high school			1
we could ask similar questions about the @entity65			0
when schools drop the pledge , it 's interpreted as an attack on patriotic values			0
but if there were no pledge , would we really choose to instill patriotism and knowledge of the @entity12 system by requiring students to repeat the same 31 words daily from kindergarten through senior year ? would we be satisfied if millions of elementary school students said " indivisible " every day , but hardly any of them knew what it meant ? if it is a pledge , why would we ask them to repeat it daily ? surely a promise is for keeps			1
in other words , we should be thinking about what we want citizens to know , believe and do and how to teach and promote those objectives			2
the bipartisan " gang of 8 " senators introduced an act recently , the @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity93 , that takes a promising new approach			0
it does n't mention the naturalization test at all			2
instead , it would create a new @entity12 citizenship foundation that would promote civic education for immigrants , especially low - income residents			1
those who seek " merit - based " naturalization -- jumping ahead of the queue -- would get points for " civic involvement " if they had engaged in a significant amount of community service			1
the law values an understanding of constitutional principles , but it adds community service as an element of citizenship , and it encourages better teaching approaches than using flashcards to study for a short test			1
it does n't specify those approaches but asks the foundation to look for " best practices			0
" if the new foundation becomes a reality , members should keep three principles in mind			0
first , the goal should be to encourage people who are seeking naturalization to be genuinely constructive contributors to civic life			0
memorizing a few phrases wo n't suffice to show they are capable citizens , but having the opportunity to learn advanced civic skills will help them and their communities			0
our research finds that people who are engaged with their communities tend to fare much better in school , jobs and life			0
second , although being a good citizen means supporting certain core principles , civic education should not be fully standardized			0
one size does not fit all			0
a grandmother who has fled tyranny does not need the same kind of civic education as an adolescent who was born in the @entity12 and knows only this country and the @entity158 language			1
third , an immigrant background is a civic asset			0
newcomers contribute valuable knowledge and insights from their home countries			0
most research on young immigrants finds that they flourish and contribute best if they hold on to aspects of their parents ' cultures			0
when they lose their background culture , the worst elements of @entity12 culture , such as fast food and violence , tend to affect them most strongly			1
as @entity2 debates the immigration bill , the nation 's attention will be focused on the question of who should be a citizen			0
we should not forget the equally important question of what citizens must know , believe , and do			2
for immigrants and native - born @entity12 alike , civic education should not be about passing a simple test but promoting high and diverse civic achievement			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity192 : would - be citizens must pass @entity12 @entity11 , like a high school test
@entity192 : committing to community is more important than knowing facts about civics
new *proposal* for citizenship will award those who perform community service , he says
@entity192 : becoming a citizen should be *tailored* to different *circumstances* of *applicant*
