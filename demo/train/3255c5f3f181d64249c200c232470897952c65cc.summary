@entity0 -- the @entity2 in @entity3 is distancing itself from statements made by rep. @entity5 that led to a government spokesman saying the congressman and his delegation are not welcome in the country			1
@entity2 spokesman @entity10 issued a statement saturday saying " congressional visitors do not necessarily express the views of the @entity15 administration or even a majority of @entity17			1
the visitors this weekend made that clear in their remarks			0
" in widely reported statements after a meeting friday with prime minister @entity24 , the @entity21 @entity20 said he informed the @entity3 leader that his @entity27 committee is investigating the killing of @entity30 exiles by @entity3 forces			2
@entity5 , the chairman of the @entity32 of the @entity33 , also told reporters during a news conference at the embassy in @entity0 that he suggested @entity3 repay some of the cost of the war			1
" once @entity3 becomes a very rich and prosperous country ... we would hope that some consideration be given to repaying the @entity15 some of the mega-dollars that we have spent here in the last eight years , " said @entity5 , according to the @entity40 news agency			1
@entity1 could not independently confirm the comments that were attributed to @entity5			2
multiple calls to his @entity49 and @entity21 offices were not immediately returned			0
it was unclear whether the @entity15 @entity2 recorded the news conference			1
it did not make any video or audio recordings of @entity5 's statements available to the media			2
@entity3 has informed the embassy that the delegation is no longer welcome , @entity60 , @entity3 's government spokesman , said saturday			2
" we have contacted the @entity15 @entity2 and they said the remarks of congressman @entity5 expressed his own opinion and not the official opinion of the @entity15 , " the spokesman said			1
@entity67 said the relationship between @entity3 and @entity15 is still solid and would not be hurt by @entity5 's remarks			1
@entity10 declined to confirm the conversation , saying " we do not comment on private diplomatic exchanges			0
" @entity5 's comments come at a delicate time for @entity24 , who is consulting with his government about whether to ask to extend @entity15 troops beyond a january 1 , 2012 , deadline to withdraw			1
about 47,000 @entity15 troops remain in @entity3 , down from 170,000 in 2007 , during the peak of sectarian violence			1
@entity5 's trip was characterized partly as a fact - finding mission over clashes in april between @entity3 forces and @entity30 exiles at @entity84 that left 34 people dead and more than 200 wounded			1
traveling with @entity5 were @entity87 rep. @entity86 of @entity88 ; rep. @entity89 of @entity90 , a @entity20 member of @entity5 's subcommittee ; @entity92 rep. @entity92 of @entity93 ; @entity20 rep. @entity94 of @entity90 ; and @entity87 rep. @entity95 of @entity21			1

@entity5 has said his delegation was denied permission by @entity24 to visit the camp , home to some 3,300 members of an @entity30 guerilla group that fought against @entity30 's government and were given haven by @entity109 's sunni - majority government			2
@entity3 has ordered the camp be closed by the end of the year and wants the residents to leave the country			0
the residents are refusing to budge , and do not recognize @entity3 sovereignty over their camp			0
the result has been a number of deadly clashes in recent years			0
the @entity15 considers the group , known as the @entity120 , or @entity120 , to be a terrorist organization			0
the @entity30 dissidents say they will be killed if they are returned to @entity30			0
the @entity15 has proposed a plan that would temporarily relocate the @entity120 within @entity3 , farther from the border with @entity30			2
under the plan , they would later be relocated to other countries			0
that would not include the @entity15 , since @entity15 law bars anyone associated with a terrorist organization from settling there			0
