is this the end of " @entity2 " mania ? @entity5 pop star @entity3 -- who rose to fame through his @entity9 record - breaking video " @entity2 " -- apologized friday for anti-american lyrics he rapped back in 2004			1
that performance resurfaced on @entity14 's @entity13 and then circulated widely online			2
it included lyrics calling for the death of @entity19 troops serving in @entity20 , not long after news of the brutal slaying of a @entity5 hostage by @entity20 insurgents -- an incident which sparked anti-american sentiment in @entity5			1
in his apology , @entity3 said his performance had been emotionally charged and was a response to events in the war in @entity20			1
" i understand the sacrifices @entity19 servicemen and women have made to protect freedom and democracy in my country and around the world , " he said in a statement			0
he said the song " was part of a deeply emotional reaction to the war in @entity20 and the killing of two @entity5 schoolgirls that was part of the overall anti-war sentiment shared by others around the world at that time			1
" the girls were struck and killed by a @entity19 military vehicle			0
@entity3 continued : " while i 'm grateful for the freedom to express one 's self , i 've learned there are limits to what language is appropriate and i 'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted			1
i will forever be sorry for any pain i have caused by those words			1
" while it 's important that we express our opinions , i deeply regret the inflammatory and inappropriate language i used to do so			0
" the lyrics of the song , titled " @entity70 , " were written by the @entity5 rock band @entity71 , and @entity3 was one of three performers rapping out the lyrics on stage			1
the lyrics were posted on a then - unvetted @entity13 in october			1
the @entity78 translation of the @entity5 lyrics has picked up steam online since then , drawing thousands of views , and then exploding on blogs and social media this week			1
@entity14 reached out to the ireporter who brought attention to @entity3 's anti-american lyrics , but did not receive a response			1
@entity14 was able to translate the lyrics as saying , " kill those f -- ing @entity96 who have been torturing @entity20 captives and those who ordered them to torture , " and going on to say , " kill them all slowly and painfully , " as well as " daughters , mothers , daughters - in - law and fathers			1
" @entity3 shook hands with president @entity102 over the weekend at " @entity103 in @entity104 , " a charity music concert where he performed alongside stars such as @entity107 and @entity108			2
before @entity3 's @entity104 performance , his controversial lyrics led to a petition on whitehouse.gov demanding that he be dropped from the concert			1
even as conservative websites picked up the story , the petition was deleted later in the day			0
the @entity117 website claimed that it violated terms of participation			0
commenters on the original @entity13 responded with varying viewpoints on the lyrics			2
some expressed outrage over the @entity5 pop star 's alleged call for the slaying @entity19 troops			1
commenter shin000 said on october 31 : " whatever the reason is , the fact that @entity3 insulted @entity130 and their family is changeless			2
he sang this song because of that accident and public opinion ? " others praised @entity3 for speaking up and expressing his anti-war sentiments			2
commenter @entity140 said on october 30 : " as an @entity19 , this makes me like @entity3 even more			2
glad to see he has the balls to call out @entity19 when we are doing evil			0
" other commenters lashed out at the @entity147 , saying that he misrepresented @entity3 in his @entity13 contribution			1
commenter jsong9172 said on october 30 , 2012 : " he is criticizing the @entity130 , not the country			0
do a thorough background research before you scribble something otherwise you 'd ruin one 's life			0
" after the lyrics from the 2004 performance surfaced , there was an often vitriolic response on @entity162 : " so mr. ' @entity2 ' @ psy_oppa made a song before about @entity19 and how all @entity19 soldiers should be killed ...			0
guy should flee the @entity19 now , " said @ @entity167			0
fashion publicist / reality star @entity169 said his " words against the women in my country " were " disgusting , " and referred to him as a " poseur faker freak			0
" @ eclecticbrotha defended him saying , " oh look , we 're supposed to hate @entity3 because he once joined protests against @entity19 imperialism			0
" as for @entity3 's handling of the criticism , @entity178 , a journalism teacher from @entity179 , tweeted , " his statement is lesson in good crisis @entity184 " it 's unclear what the fallout of the revelation of these anti-american lyrics will be			2
but it has us wondering -- what do you think the consequences should be ? should a rapper be held accountable for what he said in 2004 ? let 's talk about it in the comments on this story			0
you can be sure we 'll continue this conversation on @entity14 for the next few days .			0
