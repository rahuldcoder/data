-- in @entity8 's affluent @entity7 neighborhood , a green haven in the heart of the notoriously polluted megalopolis , @entity4 , 25 , and partner @entity5 , 51 , enjoy a brief respite from the limelight			2
while trying to seem tranquil while playing with their " children , " two rescued dogs and a cat , excitement is building as news of their plans to become the first married gay couple in @entity8 goes viral			2
on monday , court papers are set to publish their names as the first couple to petition for a marriage license in this conservative - leaning state , two weeks since @entity26 's @entity25 ruled unanimously that the nation should recognize gay marriages			1
" we feel anxious until we hear the results , " @entity5 said			0
" we hope we wo n't receive a legal challenge to block our dreams			0

@entity51 recognized same - sex marriages in 2009			2

@entity26 's ruling , however , does not allow same - sex marriage			1
it leaves it to judges to evaluate on a case - by - case basis			1
" it 's not like @entity47 , where the law is more evolved , @entity4 said			2
" but it 's a step ahead , " he said			2
on friday , @entity5 and @entity4 took the first legal step to legalize their union			0
holding hands and brushing off some curious onlookers in one of the city 's busiest public registries , the two delivered a petition to convert their civil union document into a marriage certificate			1
next stop , the @entity8 courts , @entity5 said			0
that is where the fate of their legal bond will be decided by a judge			0
" this is not really about us , " said @entity4 , who added that his job as an it consultant for @entity87 already allows them to have very good same - sex benefits			0
" it will be a victory for many of us , many of my friends who suffered discrimination			0

@entity5 , president of @entity103 , a large gay - activist group , said government studies show that 260 people die a year in @entity26 as a result of homophobia			1
gay people in @entity26 , as in other @entity49 nations heavily influenced by the @entity109 , continue to encounter strong resistance			1
" on one hand , we have made some considerable judicial strides , " said @entity5 , who helped turned @entity8 's gay parade into one of the world 's largest			1
" on the other , the intensity and frequency of homophobia in @entity26 is alarming , " he said			1
@entity5 was referring to a hotly contested issue by @entity26 lawmakers on the proposal to distribute the so - called " homophobia - kit " in public schools , an educational packet that includes a dvd and other information distributed through @entity26 's @entity127 to address homophobia among @entity26 's youth			1
ultraconservative lawmaker @entity131 of @entity132 , has led the outcry against the ministry 's move to deliver the packets , joining hands with evangelist lawmakers , who are growing in numbers			1
" i have now seen the most scandalous thing i have ever seen in my 20 years in politics , and of course i am not talking about corruption , which is a daily matter here in our circles , " he said			0
" @entity149 parents of 7 - , 8 - , 9 - and 10 - year - olds in public schools ! next year , your children are going to receive educational kits titled , ' combating homophobia , " @entity131 told @entity26 's @entity152 in november			1
" but what this is is an incentive to enforce homosexuality and promiscuity , " he said			0
@entity131 claimed that in one of the videos , a boy named @entity163 goes to the bathroom to urinate when he sees another boy and falls in love			0
" listen here lawmakers , this was published in our congressional papers			0
this could be your son one day , " he said			0
@entity26 minister of education @entity176 denied that the so - called " kit homophobia " circulating among lawmakers was created by his office			1
during a meeting thursday with evangelical and other conservative lawmakers , @entity176 said the kit was still being put together by his ministry			1
" yesterday , this material was delivered to the @entity127 from hired @entity186 , " @entity176 told @entity184			0
" now , we will have an internal debate within the ministry , " he said			0
while the debate heats up in conservative circles , throughout @entity26 , gay couples are trickling into local courts to fight for their marriage rights			1
" this is not about making people gay			0
this is about letting people who are gay live respectfully and in peace , " @entity5 said			0
" there wo n't be any more gays in @entity26 as a result , " he said			2
" but there will be happier ones			0
