@entity1 , @entity0 -- they walked into the office wednesday , led by @entity5 , 9 , and asked to speak to @entity0 gov. @entity6			1
he was n't in the office , the receptionist replied , apologizing			2
we 'll wait , " said one of the protesters			2
the @entity17 , like many groups and individuals appalled by @entity13 laws around the nation , are n't seeking a casual sit - down with their elected official ; rather , they want to take him to task for defending the self - defense provision			1
about 30 of them came early wednesday , and more were expected later in the day			0
" i 'm upset but i 'm not using it in , like , a physical punching way , " @entity5 explained			0
" i 'm using it in a talking and calmly way			0
" the governor was on business in @entity30 and @entity31 , and it was n't clear when he might return to @entity1			2
the @entity33 said they 'd stand vigil inside the @entity36 , outside the governor 's office , 24 - 7 until @entity6 agreed to meet			1
" we 'd like the repeal of stand your ground or some type of modification where we can hold people responsible to a level that humanity expects , where we do n't have 17 - year - olds getting gunned down with no justice for them and their families , " the group 's legal and policy director , @entity39 , said			1
@entity52 says he 'll boycott ' stand your ground ' states though @entity57 's defense never cited @entity13 laws in their case , the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations			1
the jury acquitted @entity57 of all charges in the shooting death of @entity65 , an unarmed 17 - year - old			2
the @entity0 version of the law states , " a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force , including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony			1
" eight other states have laws worded similarly , while 22 total states , including @entity0 , have laws stating residents have no " duty " to retreat from a would - be attacker , according to the @entity94			1
civil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated and are planning nationwide demonstrations			2
@entity52 is refusing to perform in any state with such a law			0
@entity101 attorney general @entity100 said the laws " try to fix something that was never broken " and now encourage " violent situations to escalate in public			2
" but just as adamantly as the laws are decried , the @entity106 has stood by the measure it helped many states adopt. " the attorney general fails to understand that self - defense is not a concept , it 's a fundamental human right , " said @entity110 , executive director of the @entity106 's @entity111			1
" to send a message that legitimate self - defense is to blame is unconscionable			1
" as for those @entity118 hoping to speak with the @entity0 governor , their protest may be futile			1
@entity6 's office noted that a gubernatorial task force recommends the law stay in place , though with minor tweaks , including limiting neighborhood watch to observing and reporting			1
@entity127 , director of @entity128 , said he doubts the protests will change anything			0
overturning laws is n't incredibly common already , and with @entity13 , there are complicating factors			2
the @entity106 is strong in the 22 states that have the laws , and " i think there is some popular appeal to the notion , the very general notion that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you should n't have to , in essence , run from crime			1
" also , the laws are relatively new , most of them enacted in the past eight years , and it 's unlikely the same legislators who put @entity13 laws on the books would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong			1
" the more common response is they 're going to dig their heels , " he said			0
as a parallel , @entity127 offered the " draconian " drug - sentencing laws of the 1980s , which hugely expanded incarceration rates , were outrageously expensive and did little in the way of improving public safety			1
yet , the country is only now examining those laws and considering their repeal			2
" i assume , in part , that 's because the people who passed them are no longer there , " @entity127 said			0
the trickiest factor , however , is that proponents and opponents of @entity13 can find in the @entity57 case facts to support their beliefs , he said			0
one side believes @entity65 attacked @entity57 , and @entity57 had no choice but to fire his weapon to defend himself			0
the other side believes @entity57 racially profiled @entity65 , followed him against a dispatcher 's order , then shot a teen who was only reacting , perhaps out of fear , to being followed			0
" you can find whatever you want to back your assumptions , " @entity127 said			0
putting on his gun policy expert hat , @entity127 said he felt the laws are a " very bad idea , " and they do n't do what they were intended to do : deter criminals and protect the citizenry			1
after @entity0 expanded its so - called " @entity192 " laws to a @entity13 provision in 2005 , the @entity190 released a report			1
it said a " diminished sense of public safety " after 9/11 , a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system 's ability to protect victims , a perception that due process trumps victims ' rights and a decrease in gun legislation spurred the creation of @entity13 laws			1
the study cited concerns from law enforcement officials , including doubts that it would deter criminals			0
" there must be appreciation among the would - be criminals that deadly force can be used against them , leading to a change in criminal behavior , " the study said			0
" unfortunately , attendees at the @entity190 symposium expressed little confidence that criminals would take the provisions of the @entity192 into consideration before committing a crime			0
" @entity127 pointed to a @entity230 study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed @entity192 or @entity13 laws from 2000 to 2010			2
researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery , burglary and aggravated assault , but there was an 8 % spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter			0
" the data are pretty compelling , showing that it increased justifiable homicides and it increased homicides overall , " @entity127 said			0
" in all likelihood , it really led to more altercations similar to the @entity252 exchange			0
" @entity2 's @entity253 in @entity1 and in @entity255 's @entity254 contributed to this report .			0

protesters *vow* to stay at @entity0 governor 's office 24 - 7 until he meets with them
22 states have laws saying residents have no " duty " to retreat from attackers
@entity106 defends laws , saying self - defense is a " human right "
gun policy expert : laws a " very bad idea , " research shows they increase homicide
