@entity0 -- as western countries remain mired in financial turmoil , business people are looking to get a foothold in @entity6 , hoping to tap its growth and expanding middle class			1
solid economic expansion , coupled with a rapid market transformation and a series of government reforms , mean @entity6 -- the world 's second - largest economy -- is no longer just a country for low - cost manufacturing			1
it is also an increasingly attractive destination to do business			0
several western companies -- including global giants such as @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- have established a presence in the country			0
but despite @entity6 's increasing influence , challenges remain for those looking to do business in the country			1
intense competition , corruption , business etiquette and language are some of the barriers that can be faced			1
here are five things you should know before doing business in @entity6			1
a mosaic of markets @entity6 is the world 's most populous nation , with its sprawling 1.3 billion people making up a highly diverse market			2
" there is no such thing as the @entity6 market , " says @entity46 , a business and brand strategist who provides advisory to global and @entity50 brands on @entity6			1
" you have to look at @entity6 more like a mosaic of cultures , " he adds			2
there is no single consumer profile , and analysts suggest companies remain flexible and innovative , while understanding how their company would fit in each specific market			1
" you need people who 've been in the market , you talk to trade associations , you talk to trade promotion bodies , you talk to people and bit by bit you get to understand the dynamics , " says @entity63 , president of the @entity64 , an independent business network promoting business relations between @entity6 and the @entity67			2
" there 's no simple answer in @entity6 -- it depends so much upon the specific market and upon the specific characteristic of your own company , " he adds			2
business culture and etiquette operating in a country with a history of thousands of years -- and ways of doing business that go back as far -- it is valuable to develop insight into @entity6 's business culture and social etiquette to avoid misunderstandings that could scuttle deals and harm working relationships			1
one key aspect of @entity6 culture is the concept of " face			0
" in " @entity6 uncovered : what you need to know to do business in @entity6 , " professor @entity98 describes face as a mix of public perception , social role and self - esteem than has the potential to either destroy or help build relationships			1
story says that a foreign ceo can give face by attending meetings , accepting invitations , providing suitable expensive gifts and showing sensitivity to @entity6 culture			0
in contrast , entrepreneurs can lose face by insulting someone in public , refusing invitations and gifts or by behaving inappropriately , like losing their temper or crying -- acts that are seen as lack of self - control and weakness			0
business outsiders can impress with their knowledge of local customs , acknowledging hierarchy , offering gifts , addressing people by their designation -- especially when dealing with state representatives -- and appreciating the food			0
such awareness of cultural nuances illustrate respect and sincere interest , says roll			0
on the flip side , @entity6 business people generally respect cultural differences and wo n't expect westerners to be fully customized to their tradition , analysts say			1
" at the end of the day , the @entity6 are very pragmatic , " says @entity63			0
" if you have something they want , they 'll do business with you no matter whether you can hold chopsticks or not			0
" @entity154 , a @entity155 veteran who 's often referred to as " mr @entity6 " for his entrepreneurship in the @entity50 country since 1993 , says developing mutual trust is key to success in doing business in @entity6			2
" the most important thing is , whoever you 're meeting with or whoever you 're dealing with , to treat them with respect , " he says			0
taking a market - based approach @entity168 businesses looking to tap the @entity6 market should be aware of local preferences , and adapt accordingly			1
for example , @entity22 started serving green tea lattes in a bid to get a traditionally tea - drinking nation hooked on coffee ; @entity176 's adapted its menu to include items like spicy chicken wings and chicken burgers in an effort to appeal to local tastes			0
" no matter how good you think your product is , no matter how well it sells in the @entity67 , the @entity185 or anywhere else , you need to really look at that product in the context of @entity6 and say is that the right product , is it too high - priced , do we need to do something different , do we need to adapt ? " says @entity154			2
procedures in @entity6 take time , patience and money @entity168 companies looking to tap @entity6 also need to show a long - term approach that will prove that they 're in the country to stay , analysts say			1
" it 's very important when a western company tries to go to @entity6 they have to realize that success in @entity6 takes time , it requires patience and it costs a lot of resources , " says roll			0

" ( @entity6 ) is growing in the field of consumer goods and it will grow fast so people have got to find a way to match the future impact of @entity6 with the current characteristics of @entity6 , " he says			1
build a strong local team newcomers wanting to crack @entity6 will need to move , get someone from their organization to relocate or find an experienced group to represent them , says @entity154 , who 's also the author of " @entity220 : how i 'm building a billion dollar business in @entity6			1
" " when you 're just starting , you 've got to recognize there 's going to be a limit to what you can do travelling back and forth to @entity6 , " he adds			0
" you 'll never going to get a deal done [ without basing yourself there ]			0
" surrounding yourself with local talent can help you break deals , understand the culture and the complexities of the market as well as compensate for the language barrier for those who do n't speak @entity236 , analysts say			2
