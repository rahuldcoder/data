everyone loves a good get - back - up , @entity3 - style story			0
but inspirational tales do n't always have to star a guy in shiny shorts -- or a big city like @entity8			0
sometimes the best against all odds tales are real ones , taking place in unsung towns , led by regular citizens energized to resuscitate once thriving destinations just as they appeared flat on the mat. even big , star - studded cities face struggles and off decades , but what 's kept @entity21 , @entity20 alive amid interstates , mega-malls , national chains and closed stagecoach routes ? the heart and hard work of historic rebound towns like these			1
@entity30 , @entity31 : the little peninsula that could then : a storied @entity35 getaway for adventure - seeking aristocrats and their servants stretching back to the @entity39 era , @entity33 suffered in the late 20th century with a 35 percent vacancy rate along its historic main drag , @entity41 , leaving locals wondering how to prevent this pretty peninsula on the far side of @entity45 from drowning			1
now : one of the country 's most successfully revitalized coastal resort communities draws crowds of vacationers and window shoppers over the boomerang - shaped @entity51 onto streets lined with flowers and fully restored classical revival - style buildings			1
wow : the iconic @entity30 ( aka " @entity56 " ) remains one of the world 's grandest landmarks and most resilient beach hotels , with a who 's who guest list of celebs and dignitaries several generations long			1
@entity66 , @entity67 : small town with big art then : in the 1980s , historic @entity70 was 20 square blocks of once - beautiful homes blighted by crime and neglect			1
its commercial center sat 70 percent vacant			0
now : more than $ 100 million in investment later , those same blocks are home to a vibrant arts and small business community that 's now listed on the @entity82			0
with brick - and tree - lined sidewalks that attract more than $ 200 million in annual tourist income , the town underwrites an @entity87 that 's drawing resident artists and international visitors , and is considered a national model for utilizing the arts for municipal resurrection			1
wow : held each may , the @entity92 was recently tapped among the state 's top spring festivals , featuring @entity96 's best art , music , theater and food			0
@entity100 , @entity101 : reborn on the bayou then : founded by the @entity103 in 1779 ( originally called @entity100 ) and home to five brick factories in the 1890s , this vintage bayou town 's main street was a barren row of boarded - up shops not long ago , with its decaying landmark art deco theater , the @entity112 , looking like the sad inspiration for a forgotten @entity115 movie			1
now : @entity100 's latest renaissance has yielded a @entity117 and a revitalized commercial district featuring hot ( and hot ) @entity123 eateries , rows of new shops and the beautifully restored @entity112 ( now @entity121 -- home to @entity123 and " swamp pop " concerts			1
wow : high points of a town tour include the pin - up antebellum mansion , @entity130 , and the original @entity132 factory and 250 - acre @entity133 on @entity134 , just seven miles down the road			0
@entity136 , @entity137 : after the flood ... cute shopping ! then : once a hospice for @entity143 casualties , this proud colonial - era city endured late 20th - century battle fatigue after getting sidestepped by a new interstate , losing its retail core to outlying shopping malls and being hit by a massive flood in the mid- 1970s that turned nearly 100 acres of its historic downtown into a temporary swamp			1
now : @entity136 is revived , with a nearly chain - proof red brick commercial district lined with indie shops , destination restaurants and weekenders from @entity157 and @entity158 ( both about an hour away ) escaping here instead of the other way around			1
wow : stroll along @entity163 's pedestrian bridges and brick pathways lined with public art and it 's hard to believe this green space was originally a flood control project			1
@entity169 , @entity170 : the mettle of nowhere then : originally a @entity175 station , this remote @entity170 town 's mineral mining fortunes boomed and busted through the 20th century , taking their biggest toll during the 1970s copper market crash			1
now : copper is back , as is gold mining , but @entity169 's latest boom is as a weekend escape between @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 ( the nearest major town , 241 miles away )			0
way out on @entity187 ( aka @entity188 ) , you 'll find wallet - friendly @entity190 imagery like the @entity191 ( from 1929 ) , the @entity193 's @entity192 ( fine dining behind bars ) and several land - of - the - lost state parks about as busy as the moon			1
wow : you can augment the @entity200 experience by boarding an authentic steam - powered train on the @entity169 - based @entity202 for a 90 - minute chug through the @entity170 's timeless outback			2
@entity205 , @entity206 : classic revivalist then : conceived in the 1870s as an " @entity209 " ( emphasizing education and culture ) by baking soda baron @entity212 , the small but big - thinking central @entity206 community gave rise to grand @entity39 homes and @entity216 before succumbing to financial hardship , deteriorating neighborhoods and 75 percent downtown vacancy in the mid- 1980s			0
now : after a magical civic recovery an hour from @entity221 , downtown @entity205 's rows of shops , restaurants and museums along @entity226 and @entity227 include the restored 1921 art deco @entity229 , nearby @entity230 and a revived @entity231 that inspired an award - winning documentary about urban renewal			2
wow : housed in the basement of an old bank building , the @entity235 has been voted @entity212 's best restaurant for more than a decade , and serves a " @entity239 " to prove it			0
@entity240 , @entity241 : revival , take two then : established as a bedroom community for @entity245 's elite in the early - mid - 20th century , @entity240 receded into drab suburb status in later decades			2
its first stab at revitalization in the 1960s -- a poorly conceived series of modernization projects dubbed @entity252 -- led only to more boarded - up storefronts over the next 20 years			0
now : unveiling its old @entity39 facades and regaining its roots as a homey , @entity258 @entity257 detour from the big city , @entity240 's four - block epicenter along @entity261 ( 35 miles from the @entity262 , and a world apart ) is lined with boutiques , foodie shops and an important microbrewery ( @entity267 's ) on @entity245 pub hop maps			2
wow : if it 's thursday between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. , it 's @entity270 ( june - october ) on @entity271 across from @entity272 -- a tradition for more than three decades			2
@entity273 , @entity274 : raising the boom then : home to a 1920s oil rush that brought high hopes , rows of new buildings and 30,000 people to " @entity274 ' @entity284 , " the golden opportunity of @entity273 's namesake gave way to the @entity285 and perpetual economic hardship			2
by 1980 , the town 's commercial district was barely ticking			0
now : thanks to one huge civic mobilization , mass restorations , a new $ 14.4 million conference facility and a roster of annual festivals , @entity273 has recouped its reputation as " the pride of south @entity274			0
" the once desolate downtown is now lined with more than 65 specialty shops , eateries , inns and the state 's only operating art deco theater			0
wow : each may , the bugs , @entity304 festival features thousands of revving motorcycles gathered for a bike show / parade and a two - day @entity309 -- all seasoned with hundreds of pounds of the region 's best crawfish			2
