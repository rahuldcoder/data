the length of the suspension was not known nor was the timing of any announcement			0
a number of news outlets reported sunday night the suspension will be for at least 214 games , meaning it would end in the 2015 season			2
@entity2 was negotiating with the 38 - year - old slugger last week about a deal for a lengthy suspension rather than a lifetime ban over the biogenesis scandal , according to several outlets			2
@entity3 is accused of having ties to the now - shuttered @entity27 anti-aging clinic in south @entity28 and taking performance - enhancing drugs			1
he has denied the accusation			0
the biogenesis scandal has already ensnared one star : 2011 @entity33 and @entity35 outfielder @entity34			0
last month , @entity34 was suspended without pay for the rest of this season for violating the league 's drug policy , baseball commissioner @entity36 announced			0

@entity3 and the league may be in for a lengthy legal fight , said @entity1 's @entity56			2
usually , suspensions related to drug offenses are made under the players ' collective bargaining agreement , allowing suspended players to keep playing while their cases are being appealed			0
@entity56 said , however , " that 's probably not going to be the case with @entity3			2
we 're expecting him to be suspended under the commissioner 's powers , which means that he would not be able to play while he 's doing an appeal , which is why the court system might get involved			0
" @entity3 is considered one of the game 's greatest sluggers			1
he has 647 home runs -- the fifth most ever -- in 19 seasons			0

he holds the largest contract ever in @entity81 sports , signing with the @entity4 in 2007 for $ 275 million over 10 years			0
@entity3 said friday he believes his contract makes him an attractive target for a baseball ban or suspension			1
" there 's more than one party that benefits from me not ever stepping back on the field -- and that 's not my teammates and it 's not the @entity4 fans , " he said			0
@entity3 has admitted using banned substances in the early 2000s but also has denied taking any after 2003			1
he has never been suspended by the league for a drug violation			0
@entity3 may not be the only player facing suspension monday as a result of the biogenesis scandal , with reports of more than a dozen others possibly being punished			1
first - time offenders receive a 50 - game suspension , so if they begin their punishments monday , they could be back playing before the opening rounds of the playoffs			1

a @entity117 circuit court judge decided last month the lawsuit could proceed			0
