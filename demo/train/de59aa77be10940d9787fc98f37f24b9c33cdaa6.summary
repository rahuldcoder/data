-- the new president of @entity2 , @entity1 , is a 9 - 11 truther who doubts that @entity5 is telling the whole story about the collapse of the @entity8			1
he believes that a @entity9 or a woman should not be @entity2 's leader			1
the ascent of his @entity13 has been widely compared to @entity15 's rise to power in @entity17 , including most recently by @entity19 nominees @entity20 and @entity21			0
@entity2 recently breached the walls of the @entity23 in @entity24 , immediately calling to mind the 1979 @entity17 hostage crisis			0
watching @entity1 take to the podium at the @entity27 wednesday for his first major address on the world stage , @entity5 could be forgiven for worrying that another @entity31 firebrand had just assumed power in @entity2 , the @entity34 world 's most populous country and its political bellwether			1
with his scruffy beard and his frequent references to @entity39 values , @entity1 bore a superficial resemblance to @entity17 president @entity41 , who had just wrapped up one of his tirades minutes earlier			1
but @entity1 is no @entity41 , as their two very different speeches made clear			0
since @entity1 took office in late june , he has emerged as a strong , politically savvy leader who has put the country 's powerful military and security services in their place			2
opinion : politics by mob in @entity55 and @entity56 in his address wednesday , @entity1 vowed to work for a @entity59 state and defend @entity39 against " obscenities " such as the film " @entity62 , " the @entity64 clip that kicked off the recent riots across the @entity13 world			1
but he also affirmed that @entity2 would abide by its international obligations , including the peace agreement with @entity69 , and urged an end to the slaughter in @entity72			1
hardly the stuff of a wide - eyed radical			0
@entity1 might yet prove to be the anti-american @entity75 ideologue that some of his rhetoric suggests , but one all - important factor suggests that he will have to rein in his worst impulses			1
@entity2 's economy is heavily dependent on tourism and foreign investment , and @entity1 knows that he will be judged primarily on how he delivers for a population still reeling from the economic fallout of the revolution			1
at tuesday 's appearance at the @entity87 , @entity1 did n't blather on about evil @entity88 and banning bikinis			2
instead , he asked for money			0
" we need assistance -- investment , technology , international cooperation , " @entity1 told his host , former president @entity92			0
that 's not the kind of thing you say if you 're looking to shut out the world , @entity17 - style			0
in his interview with the @entity104 -- his first with any paper since becoming president -- @entity1 signaled that relations with the new @entity2 would be more complicated than the days when @entity5 leaders could simply call up @entity109 and make demands			2
@entity2 is a budding democracy , and the @entity5 will have to take its people 's views into account			1
@entity1 's argument -- that " successive @entity5 administrations essentially purchased , with @entity5 taxpayer money , the dislike , if not the hatred , of the peoples of the region " by supporting dictators and @entity69 -- was merely a statement of fact backed up by poll after poll , not an anti-western bromide			1
many chuckled at his reference to the " naked restaurants " he disliked during his time as a @entity133 student in @entity134			0
but most @entity2 share his views about establishments such as @entity137 , and plenty of @entity5 do , too			0
some analysts worry that the @entity13 will seek to impose @entity39 law on @entity2 in yet another comparison to @entity17			2
but the country 's constitution has long included a mild provision requiring that laws conform in spirit to sharia , and in a follow - up question - and - answer session , the @entity104 ' interviewers noted that @entity1 had been quick to clarify that he did not support giving clerics a veto over the law			2
@entity1 even ably handled questions about president @entity154 's well - publicized remark that @entity2 is not an " ally , " responding to @entity157 ' @entity156 : " this is dependent on the definition of an ' ally			1
' the understanding of an ally as a part of a military alliance , this is not existing right now , but if you mean by ' ally ' a partnership and special diplomatic relationship and cooperation , we are that ally			0
" that sounds like a pretty clear - eyed description of reality to me			0
news : what to call @entity2 's relationship with the @entity5 finally , the @entity2 military has n't gone away , and it still gets the bulk of @entity5 aid money -- more than $ 1 billion each year			1
hundreds , if not thousands , of members of @entity2 's officer corps have fond memories of their training in the @entity5			2
when i was briefly detained during last year 's uprising , a young military police captain who had visited the @entity190 area waxed rhapsodic about the @entity192 shopping mall and an all - you - can - eat crab feast he enjoyed at the @entity195			0
the ties between the two militaries have certainly been strained by the events of the past 18 months , but not altogether broken			0
should @entity1 begin to run roughshod over the constitution or take actions abroad that hurt @entity5 interests , such as cozying up to @entity17 or aiding anti-israeli groups such as @entity204 , he will get pushback not only from his country 's generals and the @entity5 but also @entity2 's allies in the @entity209 , such as @entity210			1
@entity1 knows well that if he crosses a red line with any of those partners , the economic growth he needs will be in jeopardy			0
what happens , though , if @entity1 ca n't deliver improvement in @entity2 ' daily lives ? that 's when we might see him turn to anti-american populism and religious rhetoric to mask his failures and to cover his right flank			1
in other words , @entity5 should indeed worry about @entity2 , but they should worry most of all that @entity1 will fail -- not that he will succeed			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			0

@entity227 : @entity1 's views on 9 - 11 , women and *embassy* breach worrisome
in his @entity27 debut , he touted @entity39 values but also affirmed @entity2 's international obligations
he may be anti-american but will rein that in because @entity2 needs money from the world , he says
@entity227 : @entity1 must help his country *thrive* ; if he fails , then worry about religious rhetoric
