-- condemned for his self - confessed belief in fascist ideals , yet congratulated for acts of admirable sportsmanship			0
revered for feats of amazing skill , but reviled for violent outbursts on the pitch			0
perhaps not surprisingly @entity12 @entity11 's rollercoaster career has guaranteed the @entity12 has occupied the front and back pages of @entity16 newspapers since he first came to the @entity16			1
his appointment as manager of @entity19 strugglers @entity19 has thrust this divisive character back into the spotlight once more , with the north east club scrambling to justify his appointment following its sacking of the @entity12 's predecessor @entity25 on saturday			1
the @entity12 's arrival at @entity19 has already prompted the resignation of one of the club 's board members -- mp @entity31 , who recently decided to stand down as mp to work for @entity33 based charity @entity32			1
" in the light of the new manager 's past political statements , i think it right to step down , " @entity31 , a former @entity16 secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs for the traditionally left wing @entity35 , wrote on his own website			2
fiery temperament born in @entity44 and raised through @entity46 's youth ranks , the first half of @entity11 's career included stints with some of @entity49 's most famous clubs -- and plenty of rows with some of @entity12 's most respected coaches			1
the playmaker clashed with @entity54 at @entity55 before incurring the ire of @entity57 at @entity58 and then heading to @entity59 in 1996 where he flourished during one season with @entity63			0
if there was fire in his belly it was accompanied by sublime skill			0
when he was at @entity70 scored one breathtaking solo goal against @entity58 , running almost the length of the pitch before firing home			0
it was after swapping @entity59 for the @entity19 's @entity76 in 1997 that the complexity of @entity11 's character was laid bare			1
the @entity79 became front page news in september 1998 when he shoved referee @entity81 to the ground after being sent off in a match against @entity84			0
an 11 - match ban followed , as did his exit from wednesday with a move to @entity88 just four months later			0
during four years at @entity89 , @entity11 left an indelible mark on @entity88 and the @entity19			1
in march 2000 he scored a stunning volley against @entity92 -- widely regarded as one of the finest goals in @entity19 history -- but it was his conduct in a game at @entity97 in december of the same year which drew global admiration			2
with @entity97 goalkeeper @entity100 lying on the ground injured , @entity11 elected to catch the ball rather than head it into the unguarded net			2
his actions were met with immediate applause from fans and a @entity108 award from world football 's governing body @entity109 , citing a " special act of good sportsmanship "			2
" it was sportsmanship of the highest merit , " @entity113 , @entity88 manager at the time , said of @entity11 's act			1
" @entity11 thought the goalkeeper might have a broken leg and refused to take advantage			0
" values of civility but with @entity11 , the good and the bad must be measured against the ugly			0
after returning to @entity46 in 2004 , @entity11 made remarks which he has refused to clarify following his appointment at @entity19			1
" i am a facist , not a racist , " @entity11 once told an @entity12 news agency			2
since his appointment at @entity19 , @entity11 has insisted that he doesn ' want to talk about politics , though in 2005 he was willing to aim a straight - arm salute at @entity46 's fans which , he claimed , was directed at " my people "			1
was that a political or just a sporting gesture ? " i will always salute as i did because it gives me a sense of belonging to my people , " @entity11 told journalist @entity134 in the player 's autobiography			2
" i saluted my people with what for me is a sign of belonging to a group that holds true values , values of civility against the standardization that this society imposes upon us			0
" who @entity11 's people are is the subject of much debate , but in his autobiography he described himself as " fascinated " with @entity12 's former fascist leader @entity153 , who enacted anti-semitic laws and oversaw the deporting of thousands of @entity12 @entity156 to concentration and death camps			1
@entity11 is not the only @entity12 footballer or manager to express sympathy with @entity162 or flirted with the ideology , notably @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			1
as a club , @entity46 has been punished for racism offences four times this season			0
a statement issued by @entity19 following @entity11 's appointment declared that to suggest he held fascist or racist views was to question " the integrity of the club "			1
" i 'm not in the houses of @entity179 , i 'm not a political person , i will only talk about football , " the 44 - year - old manager told reporters at his unveiling on tuesday			1
while @entity11 faces scrutiny off the pitch , on it his new team are sinking without a trace			0
@entity19 are without a win in their last eight matches , with saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity189 -- the final act of @entity25 's managerial reign -- leaving the team one point above the relegation zone			2
as always , @entity11 plans to meet his latest challenge head on			0
" the press call me the mad @entity12 but i would confidently bet everything i have on @entity19 remaining in the top flight , " declared @entity11			1
over to you , @entity11 ...			0

@entity19 defend appointment of new manager @entity11
@entity12 is proud of his fascist beliefs and is an admirer of @entity153
" i 'm not in the houses of @entity179 , i 'm not a political person , i will only talk about football , " says @entity11 .
@entity11 's views cost his former club @entity213 a key *sponsorship* deal
