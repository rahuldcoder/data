-- while i was raised with conservative values , i grew up in a progressive town , @entity4 , where openly gay teachers were normal and a pregnancy did n't mean you had to visit a cousin in @entity9 for nine months			2
i 'm fiscally conservative and socially liberal			1
as i wait for the final presidential wrestling match monday night , i 'm three debates down , drowning in attack ads , and i still do n't know who to vote for			0
debates are great fodder for @entity16 and @entity18 's " @entity17 " ( who does n't love a good babbling - @entity21 joke ? ) , but for me , the debates have n't changed anything			0
president @entity24 is less of a rock star than he was four years ago			1
still , in comparison to @entity27 , he 's @entity28			1
i get the feeling that @entity24 has thought about the future of @entity32 youth and has made a clear effort to bring them into his cause			2
see what one undecided single woman is seeking let 's face it , it 's cool to vote for @entity24			1
this is why any young celebrity supporting @entity27 will make headlines a la @entity45 and @entity44			2
( who is @entity44 ? here comes a joke in itself : she 's best known for her role as " @entity49 " in the movie @entity51			0
) ignoring the crash - and - burn and b - list celebrities on his side , i 'm wondering : why has n't @entity27 made any effort for the youth vote ? @entity27 reminds me of everyone 's embarrassing @entity58 , who thinks gays can be " turned " and does n't understand why you ca n't roll down your windows on an airplane			1
his ultra-conservative lifestyle -- his adherence to his faith 's ban on drinking , his tendency to say " shoot " and " darn it " -- tells us he 's from another generation			0
opinion : does @entity27 ' get ' women who work ? his now infamous " 47 % " confession did n't help			1
true , 47 % of the nation was n't going to vote for him anyway , but i do n't want a president who thinks , " half of you are worthless -- but choose me ! " it 's probably not the smartest political strategy to tell people they are incapable and then ask them for their vote			1
i 'm the demographic @entity27 needs to win over : @entity84 , female , undecided			1
my conservative side wants to like @entity27 , but he 's not making it easy			1
do n't tell me you 're out of work and understand unemployment when you are worth $ 200 million and post-grads like me ca n't find a job			0
do n't say , " @entity94 , we 're going to get rid of that , " like you 're throwing out an old sofa			0
@entity94 is not a " that			0
" give me something , anything , to work with			0
a recent " @entity18 " skit had @entity101 portraying @entity24			2
he said , " there 's your choice , @entity32 : stick with what 's been barely working , or take your chances " with @entity27			2
unfortunately , that 's the best summary i 've heard of the 2012 election			0
opinion : the speech every woman should hear @entity24 , my socially liberal side supports you , but what about the national debt ? hope and change were great slogans , but they are not plans			1
fool me once , shame on you			0
fool me twice ... am i voting for you when i should know better ? @entity27 , show me you are human			2
inform me with reason but connect to me with emotion			0
use that connection to get your point across			0
i know your hair looks like it came off a @entity128 man , but there has to be more there than plastic			0
i may be young , but i 'm certainly not worthless , and i 'm not in the " 47 %			1
" in fact , i 'm the most valuable @entity32 @entity27 could have : 100 % undecided			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			2

i 'm fiscally conservative , socially liberal and undecided , says @entity135
@entity24 is now less of a rock star , but compared to @entity27 , he 's @entity28 , she says
@entity135 : i 'm the demographic @entity27 needs to win over : young and female
i may be young , but i 'm certainly not worthless , and i 'm not in the " 47 % , " she says
