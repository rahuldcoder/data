a decade ago , the @entity0 had a virtual monopoly on drones			1
according to data compiled by the @entity5 , more than 70 countries now own some type of drone , though just a small number of those nations possess armed drone aircraft			1
the explosion in drone technology promises to change the way nations conduct war and threatens to begin a new arms race as governments scramble to counterbalance their adversaries			1
late last month , @entity19 announced that it would use surveillance drones to monitor a group of uninhabited islands in the @entity23 that are controlled by @entity24 but claimed by @entity19 and @entity25			1
in august 2010 , @entity26 unveiled what it claimed was its first armed drone			1
and on tuesday , the country 's military chief , gen. @entity29 , disclosed details of a new long - range drone that he said can fly 2,000 kilometers ( 1,250 miles ) , which puts @entity34 easily in range			2
@entity36 looks to @entity37 after drone shot down but without an international framework governing the use of drone attacks , the @entity0 is setting a dangerous precedent for other nations with its aggressive and secretive drone programs in @entity46 and @entity47 , which are aimed at suspected members of @entity49 and their allies			1
just as the @entity0 government justifies its drone strikes with the argument that it is at war with @entity49 and its affiliates , one could imagine that @entity57 in the not too distant future might launch such attacks against suspected terrorists in @entity60 , or @entity19 might strike @entity62 separatists in western @entity19 , or @entity26 might attack @entity64 nationalists along its border with @entity46			1
this moment may almost be here			0
@entity19 took the @entity0 by surprise in november 2010 at the @entity68 , where it unveiled 25 drone models , some of which were outfitted with the capability to fire missiles			1
it remains unclear just how many of @entity19 's drones are operational and how many of them are still in development , but @entity19 is intent on catching up with the @entity0 ' rapidly expanding drone arsenal			1
when president @entity79 declared a " @entity80 " 11 years ago , the @entity78 had fewer than 50 drones			2
now , it has around 7,500			0
study : drone strikes kill , maim and traumatize too many civilians as @entity79 embarked on that war , the @entity0 had never used armed drones in combat			1
the first @entity0 armed drone attack , which appears to be the first such strike ever , took place in mid-november 2001 and killed the military commander of @entity49 , @entity93 , in @entity94			2
since then , the @entity95 has used drones equipped with bombs and missiles hundreds of times to target suspected militants in @entity46 and @entity47			2
@entity101 : drone debate -- who can you trust ? only the @entity0 , @entity105 and @entity36 are known to have launched drone strikes against their adversaries , although other members of the @entity109 in @entity94 , such as @entity110 , have " borrowed " drones from @entity36 for use in the war there			1
drone technology is proliferating rapidly			0
a 2011 study estimated that there were around 680 active drone development programs run by governments , companies and research institutes around the world , compared with just 195 in 2005			0
in 2010 , @entity0 - based @entity123 received export licenses to sell unarmed versions of the predator drone to @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and the @entity130			2
and in march , the @entity0 government agreed to arm @entity133 's six reaper drones but rejected a request from @entity135 to purchase armed predator drones			1
an official in @entity135 's @entity138 said in july that @entity135 planned to arm its own domestically produced drone , the @entity140			0
@entity36 is the world 's largest exporter of drones and drone technology , and the state - owned @entity145 has sold to countries as varied as @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			1
building drones , particularly armed drones , takes sophisticated technology and specific weaponry , but governments are increasingly willing to invest the necessary time and money to either buy or develop them , as armed drones are increasingly seen as an integral part of modern warfare			2
@entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity133 and @entity164 are working on a joint project through state - owned aeronautical companies and are in the final stages of developing an advanced armed drone prototype called the @entity169 , from which the @entity164 plans to derive armed drones for its air force			2
and @entity46 authorities have long tried to persuade the @entity0 to give them armed predator drones , while @entity57 owns an armed @entity36 drone designed to detect and destroy enemy radar , though it does not yet have drones capable of striking other targets			1
the @entity176 , a defense consulting firm in @entity177 , estimated in june that the global market for the research , development and procurement of armed drones will just about double in the next decade , from $ 6.6 billion to $ 11.4 billion			2
news : drones expected to hunt for suspects in @entity186 attack states are not alone in their quest for drones			0
insurgent groups , too , are moving to acquire this technology			0
last year , @entity186 opposition forces trying to overthrow the dictator @entity193 bought a sophisticated surveillance drone from a @entity196 company for which they paid in the low six figures			0
you can even buy your own tiny drone on @entity202 for $ 250			0
( and for an extra $ 3.99 , you can get next - day shipping			0
) as drone technology becomes more widely accessible , it is only a matter of time before well - financed drug cartels acquire them			0
and you can imagine a day in the not too distant future where armed drones are used to settle personal vendettas			0
given the relatively low costs of drones -- already far cheaper than the costs of a fighter jet and of training a fighter jet pilot -- armed drones will play a key role in future conflicts			0
opinion : when are drone killings illegal ? while the drone industry thrives and more companies , research institutes and nations jump on board the drone bandwagon , the @entity0 is setting a powerful international norm about the use of armed drones , which it uses for pre-emptive attacks against presumed terrorists in @entity46 and @entity47			1
it is these kinds of drone strikes that are controversial ; the use of drones in a conventional war is not much different than a manned aircraft that drops bombs or fires missiles			0
according to figures compiled by the @entity5 , drone attacks aimed at suspected militants are estimated to have killed between 1,900 and 3,200 people in @entity46 over the past eight years			0
while there has been considerable discussion of the legality of such strikes in a number of @entity0 law schools , there has been almost no substantive public discussion about drone attacks among policymakers at the international level			1
the time has come for some kind of international convention on the legal framework surrounding the uses of such weapons , which promise to shape the warfare of the future as much as tanks and bombers did during the 20th century			2

@entity271 : @entity0 monopoly on drones is long gone ; 70 nations have them
he says drones will change warfare and lead to a new arms race
@entity19 , @entity26 , @entity36 , @entity283 nations are among those with drones , he says
@entity287 : @entity0 use of drones is setting a precedent without enough discussion of the legal issues
