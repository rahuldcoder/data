@entity0 -- an @entity3 cobra that turned into a media darling after its escape and subsequent capture at @entity0 's @entity7 was named @entity8 on thursday after a public vote			1
the name is a play on the days when the snake was missing in action , zoo officials said			1
@entity7 and @entity15 asked the public to vote on the best name for the mischievous cobra			1
after receiving more than 34,000 suggestions , officials whittled the list down to five nominations before @entity8 was chosen			1
@entity8 received 15,972 votes , or 27 percent of the total vote , a zoo statement said			1
the four runners - up were @entity27 , which means patient in @entity3 , with 14,016 votes ( 24 percent ) ; @entity30 , an ancient @entity3 goddess , meaning ' the female hidden one , " with 11,672 votes ( 20 percent ) ; @entity32 , the last ruler of ancient @entity3 who supposedly killed herself by means of an @entity3 cobra bite , with 10,730 votes ( 18 percent ) ; and @entity37 , @entity38 for pure or holy and also a reference to @entity41 , with 6,777 votes ( 11 percent )			1
" now that @entity8 has received her official name and has settled into her exhibit at the @entity7 's @entity47 , the building will be re-opened to the public on saturday , april 9 and visitors will be able to see her for the first time , " the statement said			1
but an anonymous @entity52 feed on behalf of the once missing cobra appeared defiant			2
" so , the vote is in			0
they want to name me @entity8 , " the posting said			2
" but in my heart i 'll always know that my true name is mrs. @entity60			0
" the 3 - ounce , 20 - inch reptile slithered out of her enclosure on march 26 and turned up five days later after zoo officials scattered rodent - scented wood shavings to lure her out in hopes of a meal			2
zoo officials do n't know how the snake got out , director @entity69 said this week			2
" anyone who has ever dealt with snakes or kept snakes knows that they are notorious as escape artists , " @entity69 said monday			0
the disappearance of an animal whose venom can kill an elephant in three hours and a human in 15 minutes sparked more amusement than panic , drawing 200,000 followers to an anonymously authored @entity52 feed			0
it had the snake taking tours of the city and threatening to drop down the chimneys of unsuspecting city dwellers			0
all the attention has brought plenty of notice to the zoo , @entity69 said with a laugh			0
" it certainly has put us out there , " he said			0
" but we would have preferred to be out there for another reason			0
