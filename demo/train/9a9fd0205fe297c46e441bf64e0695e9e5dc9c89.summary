-- @entity1 was billed as the national testing ground on the issue of genetically modified foods , which draws spirited supporters and detractors into the debate over their effects on human health and the environment			1
if the state 's vote tally is to be believed , it appears the @entity1 wo n't get special labeling for gmo foods , as expected before the tuesday vote			1
those in favor of the initiative , however , say do n't count your genetically engineered chickens before they hatch , according to a news release that reads rather victoriously , considering the @entity1 secretary of state 's office says the measure failed 55 % to 45 %			1
" the campaign remains confident that a majority of @entity1 voters support labeling of genetically engineered foods , and optimistic about supporters getting out to vote in this off - year election , " said the yes on @entity28 release			2
" for now , the votes are too close to call , " reads the yes on i - 522 landing page			0
" over the next few days more ballots will be counted and we will keep you posted as we learn more			0
" the secretary of state 's website says 100 % of the vote has been counted			2
the vote , if confirmed , would mark a defeat for those who say gmo foods may pose health risks and lead to a spike in herbicide and pesticide usage			1
the @entity52 in october reported that @entity1 voters were in favor of the initiative by four percentage points			0
the vote would have made @entity1 the third state to require @entity57 labeling and the first to pass an initiative that will go into effect regardless of whether other states enact similar laws			1
placed on the ballot after @entity1 voters submitted more than 350,000 signatures , i - 522 " would require most raw agricultural commodities , processed foods , and seeds and seed stocks , if produced using genetic engineering as defined , to be labeled as genetically engineered when offered for retail sale			2
" yes on @entity71 says it is " motivated by a very simple principle : people have the right to know what 's in the food they eat and feed their families			0
" sixty - four countries have passed laws allowing consumers to know when there are @entity57 ingredients in their food , according to the @entity86			1
the watchdog group says the " limited data " on gmo foods indicates that the foods lead to higher risks of " toxicity , allergenicity , antibiotic resistance and immune suppression			1
" since genetically engineered foods entered the @entity103 market , herbicide use on corn , soybeans and cotton has increased by 527 million pounds , the center said , citing a study by @entity105			0
@entity106 , a @entity107 - based agricultural giant that was staunchly opposed to the measure , says on its website , @entity110 , that the crops have led to lower pesticide usage			1
the company says it 's also invested more than $ 100 million to ensure the products are safe			1
" humans , over our history , have altered all of our crops , often for taste or yield or disease resistance , " the website says			0
" before they reach the market , crops from @entity127 seeds are studied extensively to make sure they are safe for people , animals and the environment , " the @entity106 site adds			1
" today 's @entity127 products are the most researched and tested agricultural products in history			0
" opponents spent more than $ 22 million to fight the legislation -- more than triple what those in favor of labeling spent -- with only $ 600 of that money coming from within the state			2
@entity106 contributed more than $ 5 million , the @entity142 said			2
twenty - three states have pending legislation regarding gmo labeling , according to the group @entity146 to know gmo			0
@entity148 and @entity149 in june passed laws requiring labeling , but they wo n't go into effect until other states pass gmo - labeling laws			0
@entity155 last year shot down such a law with 51.4 % of voters casting ballots against it			0
the @entity103 @entity160 approved a @entity162 label for meat and liquid egg products in june , the first time the department has approved such a label from a third party			0
gmo foods were approved for human consumption in 1995 , but the @entity170 never required any labels pointing them out as such			1
follow @entity172 on @entity173 : @ @entity174 @entity0 's @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
