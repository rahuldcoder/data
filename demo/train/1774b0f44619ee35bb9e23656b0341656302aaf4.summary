-- two decades ago , i strode out of my house and knew i 'd never think of it as my home again			1
i hugged my mother goodbye and climbed into the car with my dad , my tape collection and every decent piece of clothing i owned			2
when he made the multistate drive back from dropping me off at college , the car would be empty , and the house would , to me , no longer be our family home -- just my parents ' house			1
recently , it ceased to be even that			2
a few months ago , my parents handed the keys over to a real estate agent and , for the first time in more than 40 years , were no longer homeowners			1
they headed southeast from @entity27 to a retirement community near my sister in @entity30			1
if all goes as planned , they 'll spend the rest of their days in blissful , assisted leisure			2
for them , there will be no more fussing over gutter clogs , leaf piles , loose shingles or any of the other burdens of ownership			2
while their house has weathered the passage of time well -- even gotten more elegant in the absence of two squabbling , headstrong daughters -- my mother has not			1
my dad will benefit from the on - hand help with her care , and she will be less isolated by her declining health and mobility			2
they feel freed by shedding the house and its baggage			1
i am thrilled for them -- and yet unexpectedly adrift			1
i know how lucky i was to grow up in that solid red brick house : leak - free , clean and warm enough when it needed to be			1
but i find myself not mourning its loss			0
for many people , a childhood home acts as a satellite heart , the warm and beating core of family			1
they 're at their most complete in the center of it , surrounded by loved ones , with the artifacts of an idyllic past intact			0
a visit home comforts and charges them to face the challenges of the outside world ; for me , it always chafed and drained my spirit			0
this was not the fault of the people inside			0
i was just wired incompatibly with the place i was raised			0
every room you live in preserves a frozen version of the person you once were , for better or worse			0
a few blocks from the home i share with my husband and our dogs , i can stroll by the apartment building where i spent eight bachelorette years			0
i thrived , loved , cried , created and blossomed there , and i almost inevitably light up in recollection of happy times inside that fifth - floor walk - up			0
that 's rarely the case when i think of the house where i grew up			1
i was a weird , low and lonely kid when i lived there , awkward in my own skin and aching for the day i could fly far , far away and metamorphose into the adult i dreamed of being			0
at best , the house on @entity105 afforded me refuge from a small - town suburban world that was n't especially thrilled to have me in it			1
my parents were kind and attuned enough to let me cocoon myself in the basement , setting up a painting ( and , let 's face it , sulking ) studio where i was free to make terrible art and dreadful poetry and go about the business of being a misfit teen , biding time until my escape			1
at worst , and especially after i 'd moved away and begun building a happier life , a night back in my childhood bed could easily press the air from my chest			1
the room exerted a nearly physical force on my body , and i 'd react by shutting down : sleeping too much , mostly to shield myself from the ghosts of my misfit past			0
but they 've begun to haunt my home 570 miles away			0
some parents institute a purge as soon as their children move away , unsentimentally chucking report cards , finger paintings , trophies and all the other detritus of youth			1
( " you better come get this stuff or i 'm tossing it ... " ) my parents were dedicated chroniclers of their daughters ' lives -- the good , the bad and the terribly ugly haircuts			1
in the process of streamlining their belongings , they began shipping this stuff to us			2
the @entity152 mail became a time machine , delivering odds and ends including third - grade conduct reports and an inexplicable pencil drawing of the main characters from " @entity158			0
" ( like i said , i was a weird kid			0
) rereading the " deep " and deeply hackneyed poetry you wrote in high school can take you down a peg , no matter how strong your adult self - image			0
and it 's incredibly disconcerting to see long - forgotten fossils of the past -- a spelling bee medal , a lumpy art class ashtray , a tragically dorky class picture -- existing in the same physical space as the carefully curated objects of one 's grown - up home			1
but these things are mine now to do with as i wish , to display or discard , celebrate or finally exorcise			0
meanwhile , there 's a slight pang at the loss of a place i once lived , and did n't quite love			2
i 'll never again skulk in that basement , sleep like the dead in that bed or dial that number by heart to hear my parents ' voices , but i suppose that now , home is just wherever they are			2
where is home for you , and where do you want to return to visit or stay ? please share in the comments below and participate in our @entity196 assignment .			0
