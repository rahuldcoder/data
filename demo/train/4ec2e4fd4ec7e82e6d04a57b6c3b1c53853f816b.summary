@entity0 -- people thought that as bad the @entity6 @entity5 franchise has mostly been since moving from frosty @entity7 to this steamy @entity9 locale 10 years ago , it would be hell or high water before they ever won a playoff game , much less a series			1
well , the @entity6 , after being just the second no. 8 seed to ever beat a no. 1 seed in a seven - game @entity5 series two weeks ago , are still hanging on in the @entity18 semifinals , forcing a game 7 after defeating the @entity20 95 - 83 on friday			1
and that 's where the high water comes in			2
if you walk out the front doors of @entity26 , take a right , walk 25 yards to @entity28 , walk two blocks west and roll a basketball down a hill the final block , that ball might end up in the @entity34			0
that 's because @entity36 , the @entity37 , is on @entity0 ' downtown doorstep , cresting tuesday night at 47.8 feet , way above flood stage			1
dark brown water has filtered it way into the northern parts of the city , making life miserable for thousands			2
their franchise , since moving from @entity7 in 2001 - 02 , has had a decade of heartache , from being swept in three straight playoffs from 2004 to 2006 , to majority owner @entity49 almost selling the team a couple of years later			1
the @entity52 players also understand that when the playoffs started almost four weeks ago , they were playing for themselves			1
now , they realize it 's much more than that			2
" with all the flooding , the people in our city could have easily dropped their heads , " guard @entity56 said			2
" but we feel good that at the end of the day , they 've been able to come down to @entity28 , catch a game and put a rough time behind them			0
" granted , the @entity6 have n't had much time to think about the plight of their city			1
once you 've stepped into the intense hurricane of the playoffs , it 's hard to spend a few minutes of calm in the eye			1
" the city has gone through a lot when you see all the people who 've had to relocate and move all their things , " @entity0 point guard @entity77 said			2
" that 's a tough situation , but this community has been on our side this whole roller - coaster season			2
we 're trying to do this for them			0
" whatever happens friday night , whether the @entity6 win and go back to @entity20 for game 7 , or lose to end the season , what has occurred the last four weeks has turned around the franchise			1
the city of @entity0 is a rarity in the football - crazed @entity96 , because it has always been about basketball , dating back to the days when the city 's powerhouse college basketball program , then called @entity101 , lost in the 1973 @entity103 championship game to @entity105 - led @entity104			1
from the playgrounds to the high schools to the @entity101 , the city loves its barbecue , blues and basketball			2
even when the city failed to get an @entity114 franchise when the league last expanded in 1995 , the average @entity0 sports fan always believed the city would support an @entity5 franchise			1
former @entity6 coach @entity118 , who guided @entity0 to its first playoff berth ever in 2004 when he was named the league 's @entity120 , said he 's never forgotten how much the city loved a winner and a team that played as a team			1
" every time i go into an arena with one of my guys [ former @entity52 players ] , it 's just incredible the relationship with those players and that town , " said @entity118 , now a tv analyst for @entity126 and @entity127			1
" i say it all the time : you ca n't fool the people of @entity0			0
that 's a basketball town , they understand the game all the way down to the high school level			2
" that 's why when the franchise struggled in recent years , the average @entity52 fan never thought another playoff run was possible			1
crowds dwindled , and it did n't matter what promotion was being given away at home games			0
" you ca n't fool these fans , because they know bad basketball when they see it , " said @entity154 , who was the @entity6 ' first first - round draft pick in ' 01 as they moved to @entity0 , " they were going to show up to watch a winning team			1
you were n't going to get them in the building with t - shirts and bobbleheads			0
" when the @entity6 won game 6 in @entity0 to capture the @entity168 ' series , the fans spilled from @entity26 onto @entity28 for an all - night party			1
and though the @entity6 were to fly to @entity20 the next afternoon to begin their semifinal series , @entity154 and some teammates joined in on the fun , too			1
" all the years i had been here before , i always wondered what it would be like if we won a playoff series , because the playoffs are here in may during @entity180 and the barbecue festival , " @entity154 said			2
" so when we won , i just had to go out and see			0
" since i live downtown , i just left my car here [ at @entity26 ] and walked home down @entity186			0
everybody was high - fiving me and each other			0
" @entity0 mayor @entity190 says the @entity6 style of play makes them the perfect team for his city			1
" when the @entity6 get knocked down and do n't get the foul calls they just get up and keep grinding , " @entity190 said			1
" in the game of life there are no referees			0
when you get knocked on your back you get back up			0
" star forward @entity203 recognizes how much this playoff run means to @entity0			2
never before has he felt so loved by a city after he had earned a reputation as a malcontent at his previous @entity5 stops , starting in @entity208			1
" it has never been like this anywhere else , " said @entity203 , who loves @entity0 so much that he personally pays a one - month electric bill for hundreds of struggling @entity210 during @entity211			0
" this city has embraced me			2
the people here have been great			0
" i 'm involved in the community			0
i 'm involved with the kids here			0
i think @entity218 has blessed me and he has made this work for me			0
i think this is @entity218 's plan for me to be here			0
i 'm feel like i 'm from @entity0 and this is great for our city			0
" @entity203 's community work is n't the exception among the @entity6			1
it 's the rule , and a way established by head coach @entity227 , who was on @entity208 's 1977 @entity5 champions that caused that city to fall in love with the franchise			1
" if you have good talent , you got a chance to win , " said @entity227 , 57			0
" but to give yourself a chance , you 've got to open up , you have to share the basketball with one another , you 've got to be a better teammate , you have to be a better citizen , because all of this is tied in with the sponsors , fans and the community			0
it 's all tied together			0
and in order to maximize who you are , you have to be better in all these areas			0
" that 's why friday night , with their backs to the wall , one game away from being eliminated , the @entity6 will gather down by the river one more time -- a river that is a lot closer than it was at the start of the playoffs -- and fight it out with the @entity20 to the very end			1
" this series is not over by any means , " @entity227 said after his team , coming off a three - overtime loss monday , lost game 5 on wednesday 99 - 72 at @entity20			2
" i still believe in my team , and i still believe we will come back			0
this team will fight to the end			0
" because if the @entity6 did n't know it before , they know it now -- they live in a city of fighters .			1

@entity6 are on an unlikely run in the @entity5 playoffs
players say they know how much the team 's success means to their flooded city
*grizzlies* need to win friday night to avoid being eliminated from the playoffs
