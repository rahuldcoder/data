-- look out @entity1 -- @entity2 is coming			1
the @entity3 may be four years away but coach @entity4 is already planning his team 's path to the semifinals			1
a painful defeat in the last - 16 by @entity9 in @entity10 might have ended the @entity12 dream but it has only served to further @entity4 's ambitions			1
a 1 - 0 friendly win over the @entity15 in @entity17 courtesy of @entity19 's strike gave @entity2 a winning return to action but @entity4 is already looking into the future			1
" it was possible to get into the quarterfinal , @entity4 told @entity25			2
" it was even possible to get into the semifinal in @entity10 for us which nobody would probably believed			0
but this is how i looked at it			0
" and this is our goal going toward @entity1 -- not to stop at the @entity34 and not to stop at the quarterfinals			0
" to say clearly we have four years to prepare this cycle and our goal is to go into a semifinal in a @entity3 and that means a lot of work , a lot of competition and a lot of grind			1
" the achievements of @entity4 's men at the @entity3 has increased expectation and justifiably so			1
this @entity12 team is a side which commands respect given its quality and improvement over the past couple of years			0
deprived of goalkeeper @entity56 , who has taken a year - long sabbatical from the national side to spend more time with his family , @entity55 's @entity54 was given the opportunity to shine			0
it 's a difficult job for @entity54 given the hero status @entity56 acquired following the team 's performances in @entity10			0
so impressive was @entity56 that he became a national celebrity with president @entity67 calling him directly from the @entity68 to offer his congratulations following the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity9			1
@entity56 , boasting one of the most exquisite beards in football , pulled off a record 16 saves against the @entity75 leading to @entity67 even joking he should make the goalkeeper the nation 's secretary of defense			0
but with @entity56 absent along with @entity79 , the man known as ' @entity80 ' during the tournament , @entity4 gave a chance to a number of other players			2
in a first half which meandered without much drama , it was the home side which should have taken the lead just after the half hour mark			0
a rapid counter attack ripped through the @entity12 midfield and @entity92 crossed to the far post only for @entity94 to slide his effort wide of the far post			0
that miss was to prove costly as just before the interval , the visiting team stuck the first blow			0
a dreadful error by @entity94 allowed @entity102 to run through on goal and when his effort was saved , @entity19 netted the rebound			1
@entity4 made a couple of changes at the break with @entity108 , the only @entity109 - based player in the squad , replacing @entity54 in goal and @entity113 's @entity112 coming into defense			1
but it hardly appeared to disrupt the rhythm of the team with @entity19 bringing a fine save out of @entity118 in the @entity15 goal			1
the @entity120 , which failed to qualify for the @entity3 , have set their sights on qualifying for the 2016 @entity122 in @entity123			2
it faces a difficult task after being paired with the @entity126 and @entity127 as well as @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			0
it did at least threaten an equalizer in the second half with @entity108 producing a fine save to deny @entity134 from close - range			0
the @entity137 stopper than kept out @entity139 's effort as the home side began to take control of the contest			0
with @entity2 now boasting a more youthful look following the introductions of 18 - year - old @entity145 and @entity147 teenager @entity146 , the @entity120 stepped up its game			1
@entity149 was next to go close after latching onto a poor defensive header but @entity108 stood firm to keep his side in front and secure the victory			0
@entity2 faces games against @entity155 and @entity156 next month before taking on the @entity157 in @entity158 in november			2
world champion @entity160 returned to play its first fixture on home soil since winning the @entity3 -- but it did n't exactly go to plan as it lost for the first time in 15 months			1
@entity166 's team was beaten 4 - 2 by @entity167 just 52 days after the teams met in the final at the @entity170			1
on that occasion , @entity171 scored the only goal of the game in extra-time after the contest had finished goalless after 90 minutes			2
this time around , @entity167 , without its talisman @entity177 , was led by @entity180 winger @entity179			2
the former @entity182 player , who arrived at @entity183 last week in a deal worth $ 98.7 million , set up three goals and scored one himself			0
@entity186 and @entity187 both converted chances provided by @entity179 before halftime to give the visitors a two - goal lead			2
and @entity167 continued its assault after the interval , adding two more inside the opening five minutes with @entity195 heading home a @entity179 free kick before the @entity180 star added a fourth			2
@entity160 , without a number of players who helped the team win the @entity3 following a number of retirements , hit back with @entity204 and @entity171 scoring consolation goals			1
new era ? @entity208 's new era got off to a winning start following a 1 - 0 victory over @entity210 in @entity211			1
in front of one of the lowest crowds to attend an @entity208 international game at @entity218 since it was reopened in 2007 , @entity213 's second half penalty was enough to see off the visitors			0
elsewhere , @entity1 recorded a 4 - 0 win over @entity221 , @entity222 defeated @entity128 1 - 0 and @entity127 picked a 2 - 1 win in @entity224 .			1

@entity2 defeats @entity15 1 - 0 in @entity17
@entity19 scores only goal of the game
