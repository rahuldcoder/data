-- in the three decades since he directed his first feature film , " @entity4 , " filmmaker @entity5 has crafted a diverse filmography , serving up everything from the classic " @entity9 " to the @entity11 - winning " gladiator			1
" but it 's his seminal 1979 science - fiction / horror film " @entity13 " that will be called to mind this weekend as @entity5 makes his long - awaited return to the genre with friday 's " @entity16			1
" although it 's sometimes described as a prequel to " @entity13 , " @entity5 's clarified that " @entity16 " is n't really a prequel as much as it shares " @entity13 's " dna , which in itself is enough to raise audience expectations several notches			1
scripted by @entity24 , " @entity13 's " story focused on the crew of the spacecraft @entity28 , which was returning to @entity29 when it took a detour to respond to a distress signal			2
it 's a decision that leads to devastating effects , as @entity5 made sure we understood , " in space , no one can hear you scream			0
" film fans cherish " @entity13 " now as one of a kind , but critical reaction upon its theatrical release was actually pretty mixed			0
the @entity44 called @entity5 a " very stylish director " but added that " @entity13 " was n't " the seminal science - fiction film one wants from him			1
" @entity48 , meanwhile , said the film attempted to " crossbreed the scare tactics of ' @entity51 ' with the sci - fi hardware of ' @entity53 , ' " leaving viewers with " a cinematic bastard , and a pretty mean bastard at that , " but little in the way of imagination or wit			1
that " cinematic bastard " grew legs as the years went by , and has been ranked by the @entity62 as one of the 10 best science - fiction films ever made			0
part of the success is owed to @entity69 's nightmarish alien , which @entity5 called in a recent @entity71 interview " one of the best all - time monsters			2
" without it , he went on , " i 've got a nice , very well - acted , beautifully art - directed movie , but i ai n't got that f * * * * * g heart - stopping son of a b * * * h that defies logic			0
" ( we 'd bet audiences would agree			0
) there 's also the grim outlook that @entity5 employs , which , along with his characters , helps remove any fantasy gloss from the idea of what the future holds			0
as @entity93 's @entity92 puts it , @entity5 's sci - fi was " progressively antiprogress " in a time when others were offering more optimistic perspectives			1
so while the " @entity13 " franchise moved on without him , @entity5 was still rolling the story around in the back of his mind , particularly the question of what happened to the mysterious alien pilot , or " @entity107 , " that was seen in the 1979 film			1
" i must have thought about it for three or four years and thought in all of the films nobody had asked a very simple question which was -- who is the big guy in the chair , " @entity5 told @entity109 magazine during a q&a earlier this year			0
that turned into four questions , he went on : " who are they ? why are they there ? why that cargo and where were they going or had they in fact had a forced landing ? " seeking answers , @entity128 of " @entity129 " and @entity130 were enlisted to pen the " @entity16 " script which takes place in the late 21st century , before the events seen in " @entity13			2
" with his sci - fi return , @entity5 's exploring the idea of creator vs. creation as the crew of the @entity16 heads into space seeking the origins of mankind			1
@entity143 stars as scientist @entity144 , who believes ancient cave drawings suggest the " engineers " of humans left the drawings as a kind of map to find them			0
she 's joined by her scientist boyfriend @entity151 ( played by @entity152 ) ; the captain of @entity16 , @entity155 's @entity154 ; @entity158 's corporate - minded ( and cold - blooded ) @entity156 , who watches out for the interests of the @entity160 ; and @entity162 's creepily cool android , @entity163 , who so far has been a critical favorite			0
although plot details have been kept close to the vest , " @entity16 " holds the promise of a space exploration gone horribly wrong , and reviews have been cautiously laudatory			0
the @entity170 acknowledged its technical magnificence while citing a need for more " adventurous thought , " while @entity174 praises @entity5 's ( per usual ) command of imagery , but found the movie 's " origin fable ... unwieldy			2
" time will likely tell how " @entity16 " holds up against @entity5 's other films , however , and in the meantime , sci - fi fans can take heart -- he 's already at work on a " @entity186 " sequel .			1

@entity5 's *reputation* for capturing a sci - fi story with skill and grandeur precedes him
it 's been three decades since he last created a film in the genre
this weekend 's " @entity16 " is his long - awaited return to the style
not quite a prequel , " @entity16 " has the same dna as 1979 's " @entity13 "
