secretary of state @entity0 took his case on wednesday to @entity2 , urging @entity3 not to impose new sanctions on @entity5 as talks with that country on its nuclear program heat up			1
" our hope is that no new sanctions would be put in place for the simple reason that , if they are , it could be viewed as bad faith by the people we are negotiating with , " @entity0 said before entering a closed - door briefing with members of the @entity12			1
" it could destroy the ability to be able to get agreement , " he added , " and it could actually wind up setting us back in dialogue that 's taken 30 years to achieve			0
" there 's likely to be push - back to the diplomat 's move , as several in @entity3 who still do n't trust @entity5 's leaders have said they want fresh sanctions to keep up the pressure			1
among them is sen. @entity34 , a @entity36 @entity35 , who told @entity41 's " @entity40 " program on sunday he would not wait for the next round of negotiations			2
a member of the @entity43 , @entity34 said he intends to propose a measure that would mandate more sanctions , aimed at forcing @entity5 to dismantle its nuclear program , a move that runs counter to interim steps sought by multinational negotiators earlier this month in @entity50 , @entity51			1
those three days of intense discussions involving top diplomats concluded early sunday without an agreement , though numerous key players indicated things were moving forward			0
" a lot of concrete progress has been achieved , but some differences remain , " @entity58 foreign policy chief @entity57 told reporters in @entity50			0
added @entity5 foreign minister @entity63 : " i think we are all on the same wavelength , and that 's important			2
and that gives us the impetus to go forward			0
" the next day , @entity69 signed a deal with the @entity71 agreeing to give the @entity74 nuclear watchdog agency 's inspectors access to long - unseen nuclear sites , including a heavy - water reactor in @entity77			0
yet more sanctions , not fewer , remain a consideration in @entity80			0
sanctions have long been a tool for the @entity83 , in coordination with other nations , to clamp down on @entity5 and compel it not to move toward developing nuclear weapons			1
@entity0 noted that , when he was a senator representing @entity88 , he played a part in putting such " sanctions in place in order to be able to negotiate			1
" while such measures have managed to hamper @entity5 's economy and its ability to profit from crude oil exports , they are not the goal , @entity0 said			1
that goal , rather , is to prevent @entity5 from creating nuclear weapons , something that could continue to happen even if there are no talks and no agreement			1
the framework for the current deal " will restrict @entity5 's ability to grow its program " and set the stage for " six months of negotiations on the real tough part of this , " according to @entity0			1
if @entity69 defies any deal , sanctions can be ramped up again , he said			0
" the fact is , we did n't put sanctions in place for the sake of sanctions , " @entity0 said			1
" we did it to be able to negotiate			0
" sen. @entity123 , a @entity125 @entity124 and chairman of the @entity127 , wo n't decide whether he 'll go forward with a proposal for more sanctions until after wednesday 's briefing and talks with his colleagues , a committee aide said			1
while @entity123 's views after the meeting broke were n't immediately known , several republicans on the committee did speak			0
sen. @entity137 of @entity138 left saying he is " willing to be patient " and is somewhat heartened by the fact that as long as " people are talking , there is hope for progress			0
" the @entity35 's ranking member , sen. @entity144 of @entity145 , said he still needs " to hear more , i 'm not ready to make a decision			2
" sen. @entity147 of @entity148 described the briefing as " solely an emotional appeal " that was " very unsatisfying			0
" sen. @entity151 of @entity152 accused president @entity154 's administration of appeasing @entity5 like @entity155 did @entity156 in the 1930s			2
@entity151 pushed for strong sanctions			0
" i think today is the day in which i witnessed a future of nuclear war in the @entity162 in the future ( that ) someday will be part of our children 's heritage , " @entity151 said			2
the @entity127 was n't @entity0 's only stop wednesday			2
he -- along with vice president @entity169 , chief negotiator @entity170 and @entity171 , under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the @entity175 -- also briefed @entity12 @entity177 leaders wednesday on the @entity5 nuclear talks			1
@entity179 and @entity171 also attended the @entity127 briefing , but @entity169 did not			0
after detailing these two meetings , @entity182 spokesman @entity181 addressed what the @entity83 should do regarding @entity5 during wednesday 's press briefing			1
" punishing " sanctions " forced @entity5 to the negotiating table , " he said			2
now that they are there , legislators should be mindful of what they 're doing if they are doing things that might undermine those negotiations			0
" if not at least testing the hypothesis that @entity5 is serious about resolving this diplomatically , then what option do we have left ? " @entity181 asked rhetorically			1
" and those who take that position ought to be clear that they , in essence , are suggesting that war is the only alternative			0

1 @entity35 senator will be " patient ; " another accuses @entity182 of appeasement
@entity181 : if you wo n't support talks , then you support war as only option
@entity0 says new sanctions " could be viewed as bad faith " by @entity5
*congressman* say they may propose new @entity5 sanctions as nuclear talks continue
