" i was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word -- in that i lived and worked undercover , overseas , pretending to work in a job that i 'm not -- and even being assigned a name that was not mine , " @entity3 said			1
" now , the government might deny these things			0
they might frame it in certain ways , and say , oh , well , you know , he 's a low - level analyst			0

" i 've worked for the @entity38 , undercover , overseas			2
and i 've worked for the @entity39 as a lecturer at the @entity41 , where i developed sources and methods for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world			2
