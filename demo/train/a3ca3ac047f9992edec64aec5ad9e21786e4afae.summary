@entity0 -- if your mother is one of the world 's best - loved children 's authors who has written more than 70 books and sold well in excess of 11.5 million copies , you might think about taking a different career path			1
undaunted by the success of her mother @entity13 , whose creations include @entity15 and the @entity16 , @entity11 has followed her lead			1
she has written and illustrated 25 children 's books and -- like her mother -- wrote her first book soon after having children of her own			1
now the mother - daughter team have collaborated for the first time on a new series called " @entity26 " , written by @entity13 and illustrated by @entity11 , with the first book to be published in september 2013			1
it will be the first time in a career spanning 53 years that @entity13 , 85 , has had her words illustrated by someone else			1
she said it was " absolutely marvelous " to work with her daughter			2
" i loved it , " said @entity13			1
" @entity11 's illustrations surprised as well as delighted me			1
she put things into the book i would never have dreamed of doing myself			0
" @entity11 's influence is immediately apparent : @entity13 's books are known for their realistic portrayal of everyday family dramas , from lost toys to days at the seaside			1
but , at @entity11 's suggestion , the heroes of @entity26 are two dogs in suits			1
she is used to writing about animals , while her mother never before has			0
" i just ca n't put into words how much i have enjoyed it , " said @entity11 , 50 , of working with her mother			1
" we sat at the same kitchen table working together in the house that i grew up in			0
we came up with the story together and talked about the illustrations			0
" @entity11 insists she was never intimated by following such a successful mother			2
" she is such a treasured part of so many people 's family lives , " said @entity11			1
" that does n't make me feel daunted			0
i feel 10 feet tall			0
" @entity11 is the youngest of three children of @entity13 and her late husband @entity65 and it was obvious from a young age she had inherited her mother 's talent for words and pictures			1
" i knew @entity11 was going to draw , from the earliest years , " said @entity13			1
" she was especially interested in narrative drawing - telling a story in pictures - which was just the same with me when i was small			0
" @entity11 grew up watching her mother drawing , but had no idea that she was a famous author			1
" i did n't really realize she was famous at any point when i was a child , " she said			0
" it might be because children are taken up with themselves			2
i just thought she was my mum			0
it was n't until i was grown up that i realized			0
" @entity11 also said her mother neither read her own books to her children nor taught them to draw , but remembers her work being pushed to one side of the table in their home in west @entity0 at mealtimes			1
" there was time and space to do my own thing , " said @entity11			2
" it was a hands - off , creative environment			0
" i first started writing my own stories and doing illustrations when i was five			0
i just drew and made things and when i ran out of paper i started on the walls			0
there was nothing else i ever wanted to do			0
" @entity11 went to art school and began her career painting portraits and doing illustrations for newspapers			2
but two weeks after her first child @entity108 , now 21 , was born , @entity11 began her new career as an author and wrote her first book , " @entity112 and @entity113			1
" " perhaps the huge life change of having a child revealed to me what was there all along , " she said			0
that book , like most she has written since , took between three and six months to complete			0
" i have an over-flowing waste paper basket and the words take me a really long time , " said @entity11			2
" sometimes i can spend all morning writing one sentence and all afternoon rubbing it out			0
" @entity11 is best known for her books @entity124 and @entity125 and the @entity126			1
a new book , " i heart bedtimes ( @entity125 and the @entity126 ) is due out in the @entity127 on march 28			0
her illustrations are bold , simple and are usually of fully - clothed , talking animals ; very different from her mother 's intricate and realistic drawings of children			2
at 85 , @entity13 has cut down on her traveling , but has no intention of retiring from her writing			2
" i would much rather not retire at all , " said @entity13			2
" i love working , and a full morning 's work is still very much part of my daily routine			0
" @entity13 will appear with @entity11 and her two sons @entity142 and @entity143 in a talk called " keeping it in the family " at @entity147 on march 16 .			1

her daughter @entity11 followed in her footsteps as a writer and illustrator and has written 25 books
