-- @entity2 , a well - known venture capitalist , got himself in hot water when he compared the " progressive war on the 1 % " with @entity6 ' treatment of @entity7 in @entity8 although @entity2 apologized for his comments , he stood by his main point that anger at the rich is a wrong and dangerous attitude			1
it 's easy to dismiss @entity2 ' sentiment as nothing more than the ill - advised ravings of a cantankerous , thin - skinned old man			1
but it also illustrates just how bizarre things have gotten for some wealthy people , who find themselves in a new socially constructed category and on the wrong side of a resurgent but elusive political ideal , facing off against mesmerizing populist adversaries			0
how can the " 1 % " make the best of the situation they 're in and reduce the likelihood of more embarrassing @entity2 - like incidents ? here 's my advice			1
first , remember that the 1 % is an almost meaningless moniker for a multifarious bunch of people who differ greatly in political leaning , wealth , occupation and ethics			1
yes , you are luckier , better educated and perhaps a little bit smarter than the rest , but that hardly makes you a monolithic class			0
and while there are certainly scoundrels , sociopaths , wealth addicts and @entity50 - devotees in your midst , these bad apples are far from the norm despite the attention they garner			2
you 're really just like everybody else , only richer			0
however , as " welfare moms , " " urban youth " and " unionized teachers " have long since discovered , resistance is futile once a pejorative new category bursts onto the scene			0
and you 'll only make things worse by trying to introduce something better ( @entity2 tried " successful 1 % , " which is even more objectionable because it implies the " unsuccessful 99 % " )			1
so you 're stuck with the 1 % label			1
but rather than wax nostalgic for the honorific categories of yesteryear - " global elite , " " electronic herd " and " mass affluent " -- try to remember that " sticks and stones may break your bones but names will never hurt you " while waiting calmly for the rhetorical storm to pass			2
and please do n't succumb to self - pity for suffering the indignity of guilt by association ; name - calling is nothing like stop - and - frisk , job discrimination or profiling			1
toughen up ! second , for all the easy talk about reducing inequality , its corollary -- equality -- is the most complex and controversial social ideal			0
is it equality of opportunity or income ? at a moment in time or across generations ? why is it important over and above the goal of helping those at the bottom ? but what makes equality difficult to define philosophically makes it expedient politically , because its vagueness and complexity allow it to be offered as a panacea for almost any problem			0
just accept that while it 's possible to be pro-gun or pro-choice , it 's impossible to be pro-inequality			1
and when cornered at a cocktail party , please do n't ask opponents to tell you what equality really means or to offer a coherent explanation of its causes and effects			2
equality is the zeitgeist for a period when many people feel under pressure and shafted by a system that they think you represent			0
if you sympathize , show it			1
if you do n't , keep your mouth shut			2
third , you need a grass - roots strategy for dealing with @entity131 , @entity132 and the other emerging populist rock stars			2
it simply wo n't do to continue relying on the octogenarian trinity -- @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 -- to be your friendly faces			2
nor can the job be outsourced to @entity142 staffers or lefty celebrities			0
to meet the populist media challenge will take some courage by a younger generation of 1 % democrats with charisma and a willingness to seek common ground with the populists even though by doing so they 'll be viewed by many friends and colleagues as traitors to their class			1
rather than put your head in the sand or stay safely in the limousine , get out there and make your case in the street , on tv , in bars and on the @entity165			0
but be realistic , for in the current environment the best you can do may be to get yourselves thought of as humble , competent people on a level with dentists			0
finally , be invigorated by this moment in the spotlight ! you have status to engage politically simply by virtue of your membership in a category - the 1 % - that did not even exist until 2011			1
but political winds are fickle and may soon blow you off the stage			0
as @entity180 said , " the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

*prominent* venture capitalist compares war on the 1 % with @entity189 treatment of @entity7
@entity184 : how can the 1 % avoid embarrassing @entity2 - like incidents ?
he says while you can be pro-gun or pro-choice , it 's impossible to be pro-inequality
@entity198 : if you sympathize with 99 % , show it ; if you do n't , better to keep quiet
