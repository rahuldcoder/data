-- @entity1 summed it up with one word : " no. " but , yes , the @entity4 has been buzzing about a new movement in men 's fashion			1
a movement so horrible it sort of makes me want to have a " movement " of my own			2
@entity12 , that might just be bad tilapia			2
here , we 're talking about leggings			1
with an @entity18 and that 's how you know something might possibly be a bad idea -- when you have to gender - specify the word with a different first letter			1
" there 's actually a lot of gray area when it comes to the man purse			1
it 's practical as hell			1
but it 's also ... well ... a man - purse			1
and some guys have a problem calling it that			2
@entity37 once said , " if you ca n't handle the word , do n't even carry the bag			1
what 's the big deal ? " then he went into a delightfully raunchy joke about somebody 's mother			1
nevertheless , in regards to meggings , @entity1 is n't buying what @entity54 @entity53 is selling			1
and , mind you , there really is a @entity54 @entity53			2
he 's the same guy who , 20 years ago , gave us @entity59			1
and his most recent project is outfitting @entity61			0
@entity54 @entity53 also happens to be good friends with simply ca n't be @entity53 , who i pray to every time i put on another worn - out plaid flannel shirt			0
he always responds back with , " that 'll do			0
" so , i 'm certainly not one to judge			0
i pretty much look like a homeless man , and when i go to a nice function , i step it up to homeless man who happened to find a navy blazer on the sidewalk			0
inevitably , somebody will say , " oh , you clean up nicely ! " and then i spend 30 minutes stuffing my face and growling at people in the buffet line			0
but , how could i know if meggings were for me unless i actually tried them on ? i may not be very trendy , but i do have an open mind			1
and for the sake of quality investigative journalism i was originally going to don them for an entire day in public and report back on the experience			0
however , when it came time to actually pull the trigger , i figured there 's no way i could , in good conscience , buy , wear , and subsequently return something that spent more than three hours tightly hugging my gonads			1
" sir , was there anything wrong with these ? " " was there ? no. " so , instead i just sat around the house watching @entity100 in a pair of old long johns			0
and you know what ? i 'm in			0
maybe not as a fashion statement that i 'd proudly wear out to a symphony or even , say , the vd clinic , but i simply could n't be more comfortable than i was in a t - shirt and tights			1
of course , these long johns also had the absolutely , positively , no - questions - asked requisite " escape hatch			0
" so , you could n't really bust them out in public anyway			0
thus , i 'm not sure they officially qualifying as meggings			1
and so do a lot of other people			0
but meggings are n't just about pure comfort			2
otherwise , society would simply give them the sweatpants treatment : you 'd see a guy , long past the age of maturity , walking around town in a pair of tights and you 'd say , " yup			0
" but that 's not the case			2
the reason everyone online is talking about these things is because meggings have recently become a legitimate fashion trend			1
and that 's where we have to agree to disagree			2
it all just seems a little too @entity150 - weird , and any mildly - rugged dude knows he 's engaging in questionable taste if he does something that makes @entity154 say , " yes			2
" but , sadly , meggings may have actually started right here in @entity158			2
@entity159 of @entity160 in the @entity161 wrote , " the bad news is they are on their way to @entity161 : @entity165 is already selling them on its @entity161 website , and their success in @entity170 is seen as an indication they will also prove popular here			0
" so , perhaps we 'll never really understand where it all started			0
but from skinny jeans to meggings , the only thing we know for sure ( but not really ) is that the world 's collective sperm count is slowly being compromised in the name of men 's fashion			1
and as these sexy hipsters ultimately fail to multiply , future generations will arise from the great cradle of loose - fitting sweatpants			0
the only real winner will be @entity137 .			0

" @entity192 " is @entity190 's *weekly* , *offbeat* look at items trending online
this week @entity194 looks at the rise of " meggings . "
@entity1 has one word for the men 's pants style : " no "
but , darn it , they 're probably comfortable , @entity194 says
