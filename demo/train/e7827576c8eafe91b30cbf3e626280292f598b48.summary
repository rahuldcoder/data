-- a federal judge ruled in favor of @entity4 players on monday , issuing an injunction that ordered the league 's owners to lift their lockout			1
however , @entity9 , @entity4 senior vice president of public relations , said the league will seek an immediate stay of the ruling pending an appeal			1
a lockout was imposed after talks between the players and owners broke down last month and the players disbanded their union			0
an @entity4 statement said an appeal will be on the grounds that federal law prohibits injunctions in labor disputes			1
your guide to the @entity4 talks in her ruling monday , @entity31 district judge @entity30 said the decision by the players to disband their union meant the case no longer came under federal labor law that prohibits injunctions , as claimed by the owners			1
@entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and seven other players filed the lawsuit on behalf of other current and eligible @entity4 players against the league to halt the lockout , which could affect the start of the 2011 - 12 season scheduled for september 8			1
the players also want a future trial to determine if the @entity4 lockout is in violation of federal antitrust laws			2
if the players are locked out from playing in september , it would be the first @entity4 work stoppage since 1987 , with months of labor and legal maneuvering looming for football fans already confused about how a $ 9 billion industry lacks enough money to satisfy everyone			1
the heart of the issue between the players and the owners is how to divide the league 's $ 9 billion in revenue			0
right now , @entity4 owners take $ 1 billion off the top of that revenue stream			2
after that , the players get about 60 %			0
the owners say that the current labor deal does n't take into account the rising costs related to building stadiums and promoting the game			0
the players argue that the league has not sufficiently opened up its books to prove this			0
in addition , the owners also want to increase the season by two games , which the players are against because of the risk of injuries			0
@entity4 's dirty secret : players suffer while star players earn millions of dollars each year , the median @entity4 salary is $ 790,000 and the average career lasts about four years			1
a lockout also impacts the league 's employees : the receptionists , ticket salespeople , and stadium workers			0
the @entity101 have announced that they will require all business - side employees to take a one - week unpaid leave each month during any lockout			0
the lockout will not stop the @entity4 draft , which will proceed as scheduled on april 28 - 30 , the league said .			2

the @entity4 says it will file an immediate appeal
monday 's ruling involves whether the case is still a labor dispute
the *showdown* *threatens* to delay the start of the 2011 @entity4 season
