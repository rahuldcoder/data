-- do n't let @entity3 's new " @entity2 and more " distract you			2
although an order of @entity6 might cost more than a buck now , the truth is that the @entity2 was never a bargain			0
in reality , whether you eat the fries or not , fast - food companies such as @entity3 's actually shift billions of dollars in hidden costs onto taxpayers every year			1
how ? these costs flow directly from their business model of low wages , nonexistent benefits and limited work hours , which force millions of fast - food workers to rely on public assistance to afford basic necessities such as food and health care			1
to see this business model in action , take a look inside the employee break room at many @entity3 's restaurants , where you might find a poster displaying information for a 1 - 800 " @entity37 " hotline designed to offer counseling to employees who need financial , housing , child care or other help			0
in a recent exchange on the @entity37 hotline , documented in a newly released video , an employee who has worked at @entity42 for 10 years -- yet earns the @entity44 minimum wage of $ 8.25 per hour -- is urged to find additional support for herself and her two children by paying a visit to nearby food pantries , applying for food stamps and signing up for @entity51			2
in other words , rather than sitting down with their employees to address the reality that the company 's pay scales are just too low -- and that even long - term employees ca n't get by on their small paychecks -- @entity3 's has decided to coach its workers on how to enroll in public safety - net programs to supplement their poverty - level wages			1
( @entity3 's called the video an inaccurate portrayal of the resource line			0
) in total , this business model of low wages and no benefits at the 10 largest fast - food companies costs taxpayers an estimated $ 3.8 billion each year , according to a recent report by the @entity74			1
at @entity42 , the company 's low - wage jobs cost taxpayers an estimated $ 1.2 billion a year -- twice as much as any other fast - food company			1
public safety - net programs such as the @entity80 ( commonly known as " food stamps " ) and @entity51 are crucial programs for alleviating poverty and promoting economic security in the @entity85			0
that is precisely why we can not afford to let multibillion - dollar companies drain the resources of these programs by paying poverty - level wages to millions of their workers			0
the good news is that over the past year , thousands of workers in the fast - food industry have begun organizing and staging strikes in dozens of cities across the country , calling for a living wage and the right to form a union			2
these demands should be taken seriously			0
all @entity85 -- even those who have never worked in fast food or have no plans to eat fast food -- need to recognize that the low - wage fast - food industry poses significant costs to all of us each year			1
fast - food workers should have the ability to bargain collectively for higher wages and better working conditions			1
giving workers a voice at the workplace will ensure a fairer , more democratic workplace , while keeping in check the irresponsible business model of @entity118 tapping the public safety net for billions in subsidies each year as they continue to pay poverty - level wages			0
at the same time , @entity122 should pass a long - overdue increase in the federal minimum wage , which has remained stuck at just $ 7.25 per hour -- or $ 15,080 a year -- for the past four years			0
although many companies will continue to pay as little as they can get away with , raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour , as proposed in the @entity127 of 2013 , would boost wages for 30 million workers , generating $ 32 billion in new economic growth as higher wages power greater consumer spending			2
a fairer fast - food industry that provides higher wages , promotes greater economic growth and spares taxpayers billions in costs every year sounds like a real value worth fighting for			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			0

@entity141 : fast - food companies shift costs of their low pay onto taxpayers
@entity148 : @entity3 's tip line told worker , a mom , to apply for food stamps , @entity51
low wages at 10 largest fast - food firms cost taxpayers $ 3.8 billion each year , he says
@entity148 : it would be a real value to all if fast food workers got higher wages and benefits
