-- it 's been called the " @entity3 of paleolithic art , " and it 's been closed to the public for more than a decade -- until now			1
yesterday , five members of the public who entered a draw were given a guided tour of the extraordinary prehistoric paintings within the @entity9 in northern @entity10			0
the vivid images , up to 20,000 years old , depict an extinct species of bison , wild boar and other animals , along with sprayed hand prints and engravings			0
the visit of a lucky few to the twisting , 300 - meter - long cave -- sealed in pristine condition by a rockfall for 13,000 years before its discovery in 1879 -- serves a wider purpose beyond their own amazement , however			1
small groups drawn from visitors to the nearby museum on one randomly selected day each week until august will be used to test any destructive impact a human presence might have on the ancient paintings through changes in humidity , temperature , co2 levels and microbiological contamination , the @entity29 reports			1
wearing protective clothing , masks and shoes , the visitors get a tour of the cave lasting just over half an hour , only a portion of which is to be spent gazing at the rock art. the results will help to determine whether the cave , in the @entity52 region , should be reopened to the public permanently -- a boon to the local economy but an outcome opposed by some scientists			1
dismissed as forgeries revealed in the late 19th century by an amateur archaeologist led to the site by his eight - year - old daughter , the charcoal and ochre animal studies and other figures at @entity9 were at first dismissed as forgeries			1
the images , in some cases exploiting the cave 's natural contours to create an even more lifelike effect , were deemed too sophisticated to have been produced by ancient humans			1
it was only 20 years later , when the @entity9 paintings could be compared with other recent prehistoric finds , that their extreme antiquity was accepted -- and the understanding of early humans transformed			0
the @entity9 cave was first closed to the public in 1977 , when the body heat and co2 from 3,000 daily visitors were found to be damaging the paintings			1
the site was subsequently reopened to restricted numbers , creating a waiting list of up to three years			0
in 2002 , @entity9 -- a @entity89 since 1985 -- was closed a second time when body heat , light and moisture were found to be causing a green mold to grow on the ancient works			0
campaign to reopen cave since then the @entity52 regional administration has pushed for @entity99 to be opened to the public once more			2
the goal was to achieve a " balance " between preserving the rock art and making a vital part of @entity10 's heritage accessible , the director of the @entity102 , @entity103 , told @entity0			2
however , the @entity10 government 's main research body opposes the reopening of the cave			2
" the consequences of doing so are incalculable , " @entity113 , lead researcher at the @entity114 , told @entity115			0
for the past decade , visitors to @entity9 have had to be content with replicas of the paintings -- mainly those in the cave 's main chamber -- located a short walk away in in the museum			1
" the original [ paintings ] can be thrilling because the feeling of entering the cave is difficult to reproduce , " @entity103 said			2
" but people have also felt excited going through the replica			0
" the museum also has a permanent exhibition called " @entity132 of @entity9 , " including furniture made of animal bone and antler , depicting life during the paleolithic era			0
