-- pull over for a second , @entity2			0
we know it 's hot out there			0
but @entity6 is about to decide whether your life on the road will get easier or be more difficult			1
in just over two weeks , the multibillion - dollar @entity10 will hit a financial wall			1
yes , another fiscal crisis			0
this time with the account that funds road and bridge projects			1
but unless @entity6 extends more funding by august 1 , the @entity16 says the account balance will dip too low and the agency will start pulling back on money paid to states for transportation infrastructure			1
the @entity23 on tuesday approved a nearly $ 11 billion proposal to keep the money flowing for about a year , and the @entity25 appears ready to follow up			1
take in five ways this highway crisis could affect you : 1			1
your car repair bill : seriously			0
according to @entity31 , the average @entity2 spends $ 324 a year on additional repairs and maintenance caused by poor road conditions			1
and that 's just average			0
people in @entity37 pay an estimated $ 832 a year because of bad roads , according to the nonpartisan trip organization which is funded by a variety of transit industry groups			0
it 's $ 673 in @entity43 , $ 784 in @entity44			0
it 's a lot of money			1
and now , because of the uncertainty with the @entity10 , many states have delayed repair projects slated for coming months			0
take @entity50 , unhappy owner of massive cracks and potholes from the overly long winter			0
thanks to congressional indecision , the state put off seven major paving projects and 11 other projects ( including bridge repairs )			2
that bump you feel from the road could be a crack in the @entity10			2
prices at the pump : brace yourself			0
the price of gasoline could go up			0
not because of the federal gas tax , which is the main source of money for the highway trust fund			1
@entity6 has n't raised the 18.4 - cent fee in 20 years			1
( that 's one reason the account itself is continually running out of fuel )			2
but while " tax " has become a four - letter word for some in @entity79 , states are starting to see it as a solution			2
eight states raised their gas taxes last july			0
just last month , tax - averse @entity50 enacted its first gas tax increase in 23 years			2
even conservative @entity87 lawmakers are seriously considering it			0
traffic problems : here 's where things get really interesting			2
for some , the highway funding tangle could briefly improve their traffic situation			2
for others , it means a longer wait for help			0
where will traffic improve ? in a few places where road construction crews have derailed the usual traffic patterns			1
in those places , in the very short term , a freeze in funding could also freeze the hassle and bottlenecks caused by construction			2
where will traffic take a hit ? places that need road or bridge expansions			1
a new $ 1 billion fertilizer plant is under construction near @entity120 and the state was planning to expand the nearby highway -- @entity2 61 - from two - lanes to four			1
instead , @entity125 spokesman @entity124 said the start of that work is delayed at least until october			0
so , the heavy trucks going back and forth to the fertilizer work site share the road , a smaller road , with everyone else			2
or @entity132 , which is holding its breath , waiting as long as it can before delaying any work			0
spokesman @entity135 of the @entity136 said the state is planning to take bids for new road projects next week , but wo n't act on the bids until @entity6 agrees to a trust fund deal			1
furthermore , if there 's no deal by august , @entity135 said the @entity132 may suspend some major traffic projects already underway , including the widening of a major interstate , @entity149 , to a rapidly growing @entity148 suburb			1
and in @entity150 , a state whose roads are known for their heavy traffic , " the vast majority of @entity159 's road and bridge projects " could grind to a halt , according to spokesman @entity155			1
he sent an e-mail , saying " virtually everything would be forced to stop " if the @entity10 started to run dry			0
you 've heard about the economy , right ? : you may not be a construction worker			2
but you probably are someone who realizes the @entity2 economy is still fragile			0
how much could a highway trust fund freeze hurt the economy ? you may see some figures on the @entity169 , but the truth is there is no reliable estimate for how many jobs could be affected , in part because not every state has decided exactly which projects to suspend			1
the @entity23 monday said it would mean " many thousands " of jobs			2
the @entity182 estimates 1.7 million @entity2 are directly employed in road , bridge and transit construction			1
and another 1.7 million have jobs that supported by the road construction business or infrastructure they put in place			1
just the loss of thousands of construction jobs alone -- at the height of construction season -- is something that could ripple out to everyone else in the economy			1
@entity6 keeps acting badly , operating in crisis mode : perhaps worst of all , lawmakers could walk away from this crisis , like they have from others , without any significant change in the impending fiscal problem			1
that 's true whether they meet the august 1 deadline or not			1
but there appears to be movement toward a rare bipartisan solution			0
@entity25 @entity210 leaders have agreed to pass a nearly $ 11 billion @entity23 measure that would extend the life of the @entity10 through next spring , @entity0 has learned			0
two top @entity25 @entity210 leadership sources said the plan is for the @entity25 to vote on the issue early next week			0
multiple @entity210 and @entity217 sources also said the @entity23 bill is expected to get strong bipartisan support in the @entity25			0
regardless of what happens with this deadline , the next @entity6 is likely to face another @entity10 crisis next may			1
just in time for your @entity223			0
with deadline looming , @entity225 to push infrastructure			0

federal trust fund that pays for road repairs is running out of money - fast
@entity6 facing august 1 deadline to act to avoid spending *reductions*
no action could worsen road conditions , traffic *congestion*
construction jobs and other economic *benefits* could be *casualties* of *inaction*
