the woman about whom the acerbic " @entity3 " judge once said , " we 're going to have to get a bigger stage , " has lost 75 pounds -- and hopes to lose 100 or more			1
though she has long forgiven @entity1 for his snippy comments during season five about her weight , she said she still wants to lose more in part because he is a father figure for her			2
the last time he saw her was last season when she had lost a few pounds			2
he raved about how nice she looked then			0

because my entire life , that is what i have done			0
" she named her new album , " @entity37 , " due out march 24 , after the feeling she has gotten breaking what she calls her food addiction			1
it follows a successful debut cd , " @entity47 , " of which @entity43 said , " plus - size powerhouse @entity2 ... realizes her considerable pipes and self - righteousness are best suited to @entity49 pop. " it sold more than 160,000 copies			1
the new album is full of catchy @entity49 pop tunes such as " @entity54 , " " @entity55 " and " @entity56 , " and power ballads such as " not guilty			1
" the song that is nearest to her heart is " you would n't cry , " a tune based on a fan whom @entity2 met and corresponded with who lost her unborn child			2
@entity2 said that when she went to put together a cd of songs to help comfort her friend , she could n't find anything from the child 's point of view			1

) " i think that this is a cruise ship like no other , " she said of the @entity99 cruise , a gathering of @entity49 music bands and their fans			1

the most difficult part has been to retrain her mind to turn to @entity22 instead of turning to food , she said			0
she also talked about her time on the show that brought her to @entity113 's attention			2
" @entity3 's " producers gave the fifth - season contestants a speech about being themselves , saying to not pretend to be anybody other than who you are , she said			1

she thinks her critics were too focused on her statements about not agreeing with what she calls " the lifestyle " and missed her message of love for everyone			0

" but i am still rooting for @entity140 to win , " she said			1
after being booted from " @entity3 , " many observers thought that @entity2 had a good chance of becoming a successful @entity156 artist			1
she said she considered that path ; it was all she wanted to be when she was growing up			0
but she felt a call to sing @entity49 music			1
" @entity49 music is the music that comes the most naturally for me , " she said			1
the pop world is so big , and it has been easier for " idol " alums who have pursued careers in country or @entity49 music , she said			1
