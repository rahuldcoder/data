@entity0 is sorry he gave you free music			1
more than a month after announcing that @entity6 would be giving a digital copy of @entity9 's new album , " @entity10 , " to all 500 million @entity12 customers , the group 's frontman apologized to those who considered the gift an inconvenience			1
" oops ! " @entity0 said in a question - and - answer video the band posted on its @entity19 page			1
his comments came in response to a question that called the automatic download " really rude			1
" " i 'm sorry about that , " @entity0 continued			1
" i had this beautiful idea , but ( we ) got carried away with ourselves			0
artists are prone to that kind of thing			0
a drop of megalomania , a touch of generosity , a dash of self - promotion and deep fear that these songs , that we poured our life into over the last few years , might n't be heard			0
" there 's a lot of noise out there			2
i guess we got a little noisy ourselves to get through it			0
" the free download was announced at the september 9 @entity6 event at which the @entity51 6 , @entity49 and @entity50 were unveiled , and at which @entity9 performed			1
instead of simply making it available , @entity6 automatically sent it to active @entity12 accounts , and for those whose settings allowed it , the album was automatically downloaded			2
on social media , some customers complained that the way the album was distributed was invasive			2
the release also came off as tone - deaf since it happened so soon after @entity66 's security was scrutinized for its part in high - profile celebrity photo hacks			0
despite the complaints , the supergroup 's latest was well - received by others			0
@entity6 said last week that the album had been fully downloaded 26 million times and that 81 million people had listened to at least one song			0
that 's compared with the 14 million users who had purchased a @entity9 album on @entity12 up until that point			1
in a crowded and increasingly complicated music industry , that figure still sounds like a beautiful day , even if a vocal minority of music fans still have n't found what they 're looking for .			0
