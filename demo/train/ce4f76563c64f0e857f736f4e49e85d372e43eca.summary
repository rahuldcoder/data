-- in the current nationwide series of @entity4 scandals , the real focus has to be on rethinking the system that is failing to serve our veterans and their families			1
i strongly favor secretary @entity10 resigning or being fired			2
he has clearly failed to lead and manage this vast bureaucracy			2
there are too many problems in too many places for him to remain as secretary			2
no one should believe , however , that simply replacing the secretary with a new person will solve the @entity4 's problems			1
scapegoating one or even a team of senior leaders will produce only marginal results and ultimately be drowned out by an enormous bureaucracy			2
the real challenges in developing a 21st century @entity4 are challenges of systemic reform that go far beyond any single person or even a new senior leadership team			1
the @entity4 is a classic example of the principle @entity29 , the father of the quality movement , was trying to communicate with his red bead experiment			1
@entity29 had a bin full of mixed red and white beads			0
the goal was for workers to obtain only white beads , but he required them to scoop a random assortment blindly from the bin			0
of course , they always came up with red beads as well as white beads			0
the experiment illustrated the point that organizations fail when the systems are bad , even if the workers are willing			2
trying to fix the @entity4 by replacing the secretary but not the whole system is like trying to obtain white beads by replacing the person dipping blindly into the bin			1
in private industry , businesses have used information and communications technologies to create highly reliable , efficient , personalized , and instantaneous new systems			2
the atm is a good example			0
anywhere in the world you can walk up to an @entity53 , stick in your card , and within seconds get cash from your bank account			0
there is no bank teller involved			0
there are no business hours involved			0
at most banks even deposit slips are a thing of the past			0
government bureaucracies like the @entity4 have seen little innovation			1
in many cases they have gotten worse as more layers of bureaucracy grow on top of the existing systems			2
the va may be the best place to start applying breakout thinking because of the scale of its bureaucracy and the scale of its problems			0
the @entity4 workforce is larger than the @entity86			1
more than 314,000 work full time for the @entity4 compared to 202,000 in the @entity86 ( potentially shrinking to 150,000 -- at which point there would be half as many @entity86 as @entity4 bureaucrats )			1
the @entity4 treats some six million veterans a year at more than 1,400 different sites including hospitals , clinics , nursing homes , etc. in 2013 there were nearly nine million veterans enrolled -- or better than one out of every three veterans in the @entity98			1
just the size of the @entity4 training system is enormous			1
according to the @entity4 , it helps train 90,000 health professionals every year in its medical centers			1
over 50 percent of all @entity98 physicians have had some training in the @entity4 system			1
the scale of @entity4 bureaucracy has grown dramatically			1
between 2006 and 2013 , the number of full - time employees jumped more than 40 percent , from 220,000 to 314,000			0
yet with 94,000 additional government employees , the system has not been able to match the private sector 's standard of care			0
consider the issue of waiting times for treatments			0
the national average waiting time in an emergency room is 26 minutes			0
at @entity4 facilities , veterans wait twice that time on average and that understates the problem in especially mismanaged sites			1
the @entity125 reports : " a recent inspector general investigation of a @entity4 facility in @entity128 found that up to 25 percent of patients experienced a length of stay of more than six hours on all but one of the days in a week monitored ... " during a 2011 investigation , the watchdog found that a majority of @entity137 patients had an average length of stay exceeding nine hours at a facility in @entity141 , and roughly 27 percent of veterans spent over six hours in the emergency room			1
" this means that one out of four veterans in those sites was experiencing a wait more than 12 times longer than the national average			0
that is a systems problem , not a scapegoat problem			2
simply firing a couple of managers without replacing systems , structures and culture will not solve systemic problems			1
waiting times are just the tip of an extraordinarily large iceberg			0
this map shows the serious problems at @entity4 centers around the country			1
we are finding new issues to add to the map every day			0
compounding the @entity4 challenge is the fact that it has to be considered in combination with the @entity172 's @entity171 , which serves nearly 10 million people at a cost of more than $ 50 billion a year			1
every effort to integrate @entity176 medical record systems has failed			1
the result has been an absurd process of transitioning from active duty health services to @entity4 health services			1
at a time when you can instantly make airline and hotel reservations or get money from an atm worldwide in seconds , it takes 175 days to transition a veteran 's care from the @entity172 to the @entity4			2
the @entity172 and @entity4 spent $ 1.3 billion to build a joint electronic medical record system for their health care services before the two secretaries announced in february that they were abandoning the effort			2
this is on top of the over $ 2 billion the @entity172 has spent on a failed upgrade to its own electronic medical system			0
in other words , even though military health costs are growing rapidly and taking up more and more of the @entity172 budget , the @entity176 is failing to modernize its system and to integrate it with the @entity4			1
but this is where the solution for the @entity171 and the @entity4 must begin			1
sadly , this dysfunction is not new			0
anyone upset at today 's @entity4 should consider the founding of the @entity4 in 1921 and take comfort that the admittedly appalling corruption or mismanagement we see today pales in comparison to that which marked the first two years of the original @entity4			2
the first director , @entity215 , hired tens of thousands of bureaucrats			0
many were cronies or patronage positions			0
they did such a bad job that fewer than 50,000 veterans were getting help out of more than 200,000 wounded veterans from @entity224 stole hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money as the scandal broke , president @entity226 summoned @entity224 to the @entity228 and " took him by the neck and shook @entity224 ' as a dog would a rat , ' " as @entity233 writes in her book " @entity237 , " ending the tenure of the first director of the modern @entity4			2
appropriately , @entity224 wound up in jail for this corruption			0
we can take some comfort that for all its current problems the system is vastly more honest and accountable than it was in 1921			0
now we have to have the courage to develop a system worthy of our veterans , our active duty military and their families for 2021 and beyond .			0

@entity250 : @entity4 secretary should quit , but replacing him is *n't* the solution
he says the @entity4 is so enormous and so *inadequate* that it requires a systems change
all efforts to integrate its systems with the @entity260 have failed , he says
