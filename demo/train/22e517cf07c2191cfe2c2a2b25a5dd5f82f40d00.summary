-- a panel of @entity3 judges ruled tuesday that concert promoters -- and not @entity6 frontman @entity5 -- were largely to blame for the tragic death nearly three years ago of a teenage fan of the metal band , saying the singer 's actions did not constitute a crime			1
the state attorney , who had sought a conviction for manslaughter and asked for the minimum sentence of five years , immediately appealed the decision			0
@entity18 declined to talk to the press after the trial but told the court earlier he was ready to face the music			1
" as i 've stated previously , i do not wish to avoid my responsibility , and if i thought i were guilty i would plead guilty right now , " he said			0
" i still believe i acted responsibly to protect myself , my band , our equipment , and our audience			0
i did not strike anyone or run across the stage to push anyone , " as one witness had claimed			0
@entity34 : @entity6 's @entity5 on @entity35 and @entity36 concertgoers testified in february and on monday that @entity18 had violently pushed 19 - year - old @entity38 off the stage during the band 's concert in @entity42 on may 24 , 2010 , using both hands			1
but there were stark and contradicting differences in key details as to when the young man breached the security barrier and which way he was facing when allegedly pushed , points the defense played up to create reasonable doubt in @entity53 's favor			1
what is clear is that later that evening , the @entity3 teenager -- though sober and not under the influence of any drugs -- fell on his back and hit his head , appeared to be ok but later complained of a headache , and vomited violently			1
he was rushed to a hospital , where he underwent emergency brain surgery but slipped into a coma and died several weeks later			1
an expert on biomechanics , called by @entity18 's defense , presented the results of a recreation of the fall -- in part using " fresh cadavers dead for less than 12 hours " to measure the impact on a human skull -- to the court on tuesday			2
the expert said @entity38 must have fallen backwards as he would not have had time , involuntarily , to twist around before impact			0
had the teenager fallen forward , his hands would have reflexively shot out to protect himself , he said			0
@entity81 @entity5 's @entity80 resumes in @entity42 crucially for @entity18 's defense , the expert said that had the teenager been pushed , he would not have fallen beyond the first row of fans , as two witnesses had testified			1
but state attorney @entity87 -- a bear of a man , whose forearms could not be contained by his crimson - trimmed black robe -- took great issue with the experiment , which he argued failed to recreate actual conditions and discounted the testimony of a key witness			2
the presiding judge wholeheartedly agreed with the prosecutor while noting most witnesses ' recollections were " foggy " at best			0
while video footage had captured images of @entity18 subduing an admittedly drunk and out - of - control fan named @entity105 -- who had rushed the stage three times -- the fatal moment leading to @entity38 's death was not recorded			1
the presiding judge , @entity110 , put the lion 's share of the blame for the tragedy on lax security and safety precautions at the @entity42 club , which thereby allowed fans to take to the stage			2
@entity110 said " ninety percent of the audience " must have known stage - diving was prohibited and dangerous			2
he said the teenager , who was reportedly a @entity6 fanatic but understood little @entity122 , evidently also misunderstood @entity53 's hand gesture calling for applause " that would have been absolutely understandable for @entity122 speakers " as an invitation to take to the stage			1
nonetheless , the judge said , @entity38 must have known that stage - diving was not permitted , as there was a barrier in place and security personnel who had prevented other fans from climbing over it			2
@entity137 responds to @entity138 as for the over $ 500,000 the boy 's family is seeking in damages , @entity110 said they should try to get the money from the concert promoters and organizers			1
for his part , the @entity6 singer made a heartfelt apology to the @entity149 , saying , " i can understand that pain as only the father of a dead child can			2
" " this has been a very sad and emotive experience for me , but i 've tried to remain as objective as possible because my emotions have no impact on what is for me and for the family of @entity38 the most important thing : the truth , " said @entity18			0
" he was just a boy			0
i wish he were still here			0
" @entity18 had pledged " to serve my sentence like a man " if found guilty by the @entity3 courts and to work tirelessly to prevent another such tragedy from ever occurring at a @entity6 show " or any other show " -- if found innocent			1
