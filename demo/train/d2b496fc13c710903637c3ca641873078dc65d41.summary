-- 3 - d printers are currently being used or explored by a multitude of industries -- from printing toys and automotive parts to meat and even houses			0
in medicine , they are already used to print prosthetic limbs and make patient - specific models of body parts that surgeons can use as guides during reconstructive surgery			1
it 's no surprise , then , that scientists around the world are investigating whether living cells can be used to print replacement organs and tissues			1
3 - d printing is an exciting technology that i except to play a significant role as scientists expand their ability to engineer tissues and organs in the lab. what many people do n't realize , however , is that the printer itself is not the " magic " ingredient for making lab - built organs a reality			1
instead , printers are a vehicle for scaling up and automating a process that must begin at the laboratory bench			0
before any organ can be engineered -- whether it 's printed or built by hand -- there is much groundwork that must be accomplished			2
vital to the process is a thorough understanding of cell biology			0
scientists must determine not only what types of cells to use , but how to expand them in the lab and how to keep them alive and viable throughout the engineering process			1
do they need to be imbedded in biocompatible material ? if so , which biomaterial is most suitable ? the bar for success is high -- the structures we engineer must function like native tissue			2
interactive : how 3 - d printing will reshape the world lab - built organs scientists on multiple teams have already demonstrated that lab - built organs can function quite well in patients			1
engineered airways , bladders , blood vessels and urine tubes have been successfully implanted			0
what these structures have in common is that they are a combination of cells and biomaterials made in the shape of an organ or tissue			1
in our initial experience engineering tissues , we made these @entity85 structures by hand			2
for example , by suturing a strip of biocompatible material into a tubular shape , we made scaffolds for urine tubes			0
with a pipette , cells were then added by hand to these structures			2
3 - d printers , on the other hand , offer the opportunity to very precisely combine cells and materials into the desired shape			2
the replacement tissue or organ can be designed on a computer using a patient 's medical scans			0
the computer then controls the printer as it precisely prints the desired shape and determines cell placement			0
the printers we 've designed give us the option of using two or more different cell types and placing them exactly where they need to be -- something not possible by hand			0
read this : regenerative medicine 's promising future 3 - d printers also have the flexibility of using a variety of biomaterials so that cells can be printed in either gel - like or rigid scaffolds , or printed without scaffolds			2
in addition , structures can be printed without cells , as was the case of a printed airway splint developed by the @entity133 that saved a young child 's life			1
an ultimate goal of bioprinting , of course , is to be able to print complex structures such as kidneys that can help solve the shortage of organs available for transplant			1
while i believe this is achievable , there are many challenges to overcome before this is a reality			0
oxygen supply any large organ structure -- regardless of how it is engineered -- is not like the fully functioning organ harvested from a donor			0
instead , even when printed structures are made with living cells , they must " incubate " in the body to become fully functional			1
as the scaffold gradually degrades , the cells lay down new tissue -- resulting in a new organ			0
a major challenge in tissue engineering is to supply these structures with oxygen while they integrate with the body			1
one possibility is to print small channels into the structures that can be populated with blood vessel cells			1
another option might be to print oxygen - producing materials into the scaffolds			2
while there are many challenges to solve , i believe the printing of complex organs will become reality , but not for decades			2
other projects involving bioprinting are further along and closer to benefiting patients			0
for example , for the military - funded @entity183 , our team is working to print smaller tissues , such as bone and muscle , that would be used in facial reconstruction			1
we are also working to print skin cells directly onto burn wounds			1
but implantable tissue is not the only way @entity85 printing can benefit patients			0
our team and others are using 3 - d printers to print miniature livers that have the potential to be used for drug testing			1
in addition , in collaboration with five other institutions , we are working to print miniature hearts , lungs , blood vessels and livers onto " chips " that will be connected with a blood substitute			1
called a " body on a chip , " the system has the potential to speed up the development of new drugs because it could potentially replace testing in animals , which can be slow , expensive and not always accurate			0
@entity217 is a rapidly developing field of science that obviously has many potential applications in medicine			0
even five years from now , i suspect researchers will be pursuing potential treatments that are unimaginable today			0
it is important to remember , though , that the process involves more than putting cells in a cartridge and pressing " print			2
" developments that occur at the laboratory bench are an integral part of the equation and what can be accomplished with printing depends , in large part , on advancements in cell biology and materials science			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity242 .			1

scientists are trying to use living cells to print replacement organs and tissues
we will eventually be able to transplant complex printed organs , says dr. @entity242
a major challenge is supplying these structures with oxygen while they integrate with body
