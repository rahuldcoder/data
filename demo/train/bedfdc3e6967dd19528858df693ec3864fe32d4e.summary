-- whisper it quietly , but after years of foreign domination the prospect of a @entity4 winner of the @entity5 is more than just a mere pipe dream			1
you have to rewind the clock to 1985 -- 29 long years -- to find the last time that a home winner stepped on to the podium on the @entity12 -- with @entity13 claiming his fifth and final victory			1
@entity13 is ranked among the all - time greats and one of only six men , 2014 @entity5 winner @entity18 included , to win all three of the sports major tours in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity4			1
but his legacy has been one of a steady decline with @entity29 's second place in 1997 the last time a @entity4 rider even made the podium -- until this year			1
@entity32 and 24 - year - old @entity33 may have finished around eight minutes adrift of @entity22 's @entity34 in second and third spots respectively , but that hardly mattered to a @entity4 public desperate for success			1
further hope came in the form of 23 - year - old @entity41 , who battled it out with compatriot @entity33 for the white jersey of best young rider , before coming home a creditable sixth			2
" the @entity4 , promise for 2015 , " read monday 's headline in the famous sporting newspaper @entity47 , already anticipating next year 's @entity48			1
@entity33 's burst to briefly distance @entity18 on one of the 16th stage in the @entity53 last tuesday had set home pulses racing , although the team @entity56 hope admitted he had made his move with thoughts of white rather the yellow jersey of the leader			1
" my big objective was to gain time on @entity41 , " @entity33 said after his heroics			1
he had eventually to give best to compatriot @entity32 , who despite being 37 has only been a professional on the road circuit since 2009 , having previously won a silver medal at the @entity66 in mountain biking			1
@entity32 's superior ability at individual time trialing ( racing alone against the clock ) saw him edge out his @entity4 rival but it was the young men , @entity33 and @entity41 , who hold most hope for the future			1
" it was great for the @entity4 to have two men on the podium , " said @entity74 , of @entity75			2
" with @entity79 i think they are really optimistic for next year , he 's quite a character			0
" i think the @entity5 is always better when home riders are performing well , there 's a lot more enthusiasm about the race and the @entity4 never need an excuse to be patriotic , " he added			1
over the past decade that patriotism has mostly been reserved for the never - day - die attitude of @entity90 , still making brave breakaways , for team @entity92 on this year 's tour at the age of 35			0
back in 2004 , @entity90 became a national hero when he led the tour for against the odds for 10 days with the fleeting prospect he could beat the all - conquering @entity99			0
even back then there was the suspicion -- particularly in the @entity4 media -- that @entity99 was getting extra help from banned substances , while home riders , personified by @entity90 were manifestly " pure " and free of drugs			2
with @entity99 disgraced and stripped of his seven @entity5 titles , cycling is believed to have cleaned up its act and there have been no positive tests on the 2014 edition			0
@entity74 believes the @entity4 have more to gain than most in the new era			0
" in the past nobody really knew what was going on , " he said			0
" now there are so many good signs , the @entity4 have always been anti-doping and now they are able to compete for the yellow jersey			0
" whether that 's a realistic prospect , certainly for 2015 , will depend on if @entity18 is able to repeat his outstanding performances , four stage wins included , and @entity123 and @entity124 can return with a vengeance			2
" he 's a most deserved winner , " said @entity74 of @entity34			0
" he had the yellow jersey for all but two days and his margin of victory is the second biggest in @entity5 history			0
" @entity18 's victory is also a shot in the arm for @entity22 cycling , which like its @entity4 counterpart , has been in something of a trough , hit by doping scandals and the poor state of its economy			1
despite previous victories in the @entity143 and @entity5 , he had been lightly regarded by the media , " only about half a dozen journalists attended his pre-race press conference , " said @entity74 , but proved them wrong			0
an audacious late break to win the second stage in @entity151 , @entity152 , saw him gain time on @entity123 and @entity124 and he rode brilliantly on the treacherous and cobbled fifth stage to open up a further gap			0
after his main rivals exited , @entity18 proceeded to claim a further three stage wins in the @entity158 and @entity53 and comfortably hold off the challenge mounted by his @entity4 rivals and @entity23 's @entity161			1
@entity22 's main sports newspaper @entity162 gave him top billing with a nice tribute from @entity13 , who congratulated him on the podium in @entity168			1
" throughout the tour , @entity18 has shown great wisdom , mastery , he never panicked , " he said			2
the 59 - year - old @entity13 , who works for @entity5 organizers @entity174 , will doubtless be hoping against hope that over the next coming years he will be presenting the yellow jersey on the @entity12 to a compatriot			0
it is not only @entity33 and @entity41 who could break the overseas domination of the top step of the podium			2
there are high hopes for 22 - year - old @entity184 , described by @entity13 as a " huge talent " after winning two mountain stages of the @entity5 last year			0
@entity184 was left off the @entity188 squad because it concentrated on helping @entity191 's @entity190 win four stages of this year 's @entity5 , including the blue - riband finish on the @entity12			0
@entity4 sprinting talent is also emerging , with young fast men like @entity196 , third in the points classification to @entity199 this year and @entity200 , who won three stages of the @entity143			2
whether they can challenge the likes of @entity190 and @entity205 's @entity204 , who did not make it past stage one after hitting the tarmac in @entity210 , in the future is again open to debate , but it all points to a welcome renaissance for the traditional home of cycling .			0
