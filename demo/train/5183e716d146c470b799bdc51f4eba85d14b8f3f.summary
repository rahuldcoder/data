-- after four years off of the silver screen , @entity1 made his triumphant return this weekend in " @entity4 " — and the @entity7 spy 's appeal was bigger than ever			1
the action thriller grossed a truly massive $ 87.8 million in its first three days ( and an additional $ 2.2 million during thursday night previews ) , making its debut the very best in the @entity1 series ' 23 - film history — by a huge margin			1
" @entity4 " shattered the previous opening weekend record for a @entity1 film , which was set in 2008 when " @entity17 " bowed with $ 67.5 million			1
with the lucrative @entity20 holiday on the horizon and a straight " a " @entity23 grade , it 's likely that " @entity4 " will also become the first @entity1 movie to ever pass the $ 200 million mark at the domestic box office			1
( of course , this is not accounting for inflation			0
) @entity0 critics disagree on ' @entity4 ' " @entity4 's " debut marks the seventh - best november opening weekend of all time — behind two " @entity40 " films and four " @entity34 " titles — and the film , which @entity36 and @entity37 spent about $ 200 million to make , garnered an impressive $ 25,050 per theater average from 3,505 theaters			1
" @entity4 's " per - theater average was even more impressive in @entity43 locations , where the film found $ 13.1 million ( 15 percent of its weekend gross ) from 320 screens , good for a $ 40,938 average			1
@entity48 , the sixth man to play @entity1 , has seen his popularity as the character surge since taking over the iconic role in 2006			0
his first @entity1 film , " @entity53 , " debuted with $ 40.8 million on the way to a $ 167.4 million finish			1
two years later , " @entity17 " opened 65 percent higher with $ 67.5 million on the way to $ 168.5 million total			2
( reception for the film was tepid , which is why its endurance at the box office was so much weaker than " @entity53 's			1
" ) and now " @entity4 " has improved upon " @entity62 's " opening weekend by 30 percent			1
at this rate , @entity48 's next turn as @entity1 ( due in 2014 ) could garner well over $ 100 million in its debut frame			1
@entity0 poll : ' @entity4 's ' @entity67 is ... before the weekend had even begun , " @entity4 " had already proven itself a remarkable success internationally , and it continued to do so over the past three days			2
in its third weekend of release , the film earned an additional $ 89 million , which lifts its overseas total to $ 428.6 million and its worldwide cumulative to $ 518.6 million			1
" @entity4 's " most popular international territory has been the @entity7 , where it has earned £ 72.9 million ( $ 117.5 million ) in 17 days , already establishing it as the fourth highest grossing film in @entity7 history			1
" @entity4 " will easily become the first @entity1 film to surpass $ 600 million worldwide — a testament to both the booming state of the international box office and @entity1 's enduring appeal			1
so what made " @entity4 " reach such sky - high numbers ? timing likely helped			2
though @entity37 's financial woes prevented the film from starting production on schedule , the delay may have worked in " @entity4 's " favor			2
not only were audiences ( which were 60 percent male and 75 percent above the age of 25 ) extra-eager for a new installment , but the film got to debut during the 50th anniversary year of the @entity1 franchise , which has given the character substantial publicity in 2012			1
on top of that , @entity101 's well - received theme song has also boosted " @entity4 's " profile nicely			2
it debuted at no. 8 on @entity106 's @entity105			0
' @entity4 ' : one of the best @entity1 films ever ? moreover , @entity36 aggressively marketed the film over the past two months , and @entity48 's numerous endorsement deals have kept his public profile strong leading up to the release			2
still , all these marketing and publicity efforts pale in comparison to the organic buzz that formed around " @entity4			2
" the presence of director @entity117 and @entity119 winner @entity118 gave the project an elevated pedigree , and early response to the film ranged from strong to wildly positive			0
( it currently boasts a 93 percent " fresh " rating on @entity126			0
) and , coverage in the @entity128 of the film 's boffo international business only swelled anticipation further			0
in other words , the stars aligned perfectly for " @entity4 " to have a true box office moment			1
heading into the frame , i predicted an $ 85 million opening weekend			1
' @entity4 ' : box office preview other movies at the box office held up well in the face of " @entity4			1
" @entity145 's animated " @entity144 " finished in second place , dropping by a slim 33 percent to $ 33.1 million in its sophomore weekend			0
after 10 days , the $ 165 million videogame - themed comedy has grossed $ 93.7 million , and provided it is n't utterly cannibalized by @entity149 ' " @entity148 " ( due november 21 ) , it looks to be headed for a finish in the $ 175 - 200 million range			1
" @entity144 's " weekend gross is particularly notable given the fact that it made " only " $ 7.8 million on friday			0
family films have a tendency to bring in booming bucks on saturday and hold well on sunday , and " @entity144 " was no exception			0
it increased by a whopping 87 percent to $ 14.7 million on saturday and eased just 29 percent to $ 10.5 million on sunday			0
@entity164 's " flight " descended into third place in its second frame , dropping 39 percent to $ 15.1 million — an impressive hold considering it shares an adult target audience with " @entity4			2
" @entity166 's well - received $ 31 million drama has earned $ 47.8 million after ten days , and it 's vying to become @entity168 's second $ 100 million earner in 2012 after " @entity169 , " which grossed $ 126.2 million in february			1
" @entity172 " held strong in fourth place in its fifth weekend of release			0
@entity175 ' $ 45 million @entity174 - directed feature dropped 34 percent to $ 6.7 million , bringing its domestic total to $ 85.7 million			2
over the next few weeks , a slew of expected nominations and honors at end - of - the - year awards ceremonies should help push " @entity172 " right past $ 100 million			0
rounding out the top five was @entity182 's " taken 2 , " which dipped 32 percent to $ 4 million and now has a strong $ 131.3 million total			0
the $ 45 million @entity185 thriller has proved powerful overseas as well — its international total stood at $ 217.1 million heading into the weekend			2
" @entity4 " -- $ 87.8 million 2			1
" @entity144 " -- $ 33.1 million 3			0
" flight " -- $ 15.1 million 4			0
" @entity172 " -- $ 6.7 million 5			0
" taken 2 " -- $ 4.0 million in limited release , @entity149 ' " @entity193 " got off to a tremendous start , earning $ 900,000 from 11 theaters in seven cities , enough for a stunning $ 81,818 per theater average			0
the @entity195 - helmed @entity119 contender , which earned an " a " @entity23 grade , will expand into about 1,500 locations next weekend , when it will face off against " @entity199 : breaking @entity200 -- part 2 , " which , based on early tracking reports , just may be the biggest " @entity40 " movie of them all			0
