@entity0 -- mention bedbugs and the natural reaction is to shudder and start scratching			1
but one who does n't get the heebee jeebees is @entity6 -- canine detective and professional bedbug catcher			1
trained at the @entity9 in @entity10 , the two - year - old @entity8 is all that pest controller @entity12 needs			1
with @entity6 's heightened sense of smell , @entity13 can identify bedbugs and their eggs without having to rely on the telltale signs -- feces that appear as tiny black spots that smear when wiped			1
bedbugs like to stay close to people -- " anything that is in close proximity to where we are or where we sleep , " explains @entity13 , owner of @entity27			1
" seventy percent of bedbugs tend to be quite close to us , and then within 5 foot , we 've got ( another ) 23 % , research shows , " he says			1
the remaining 7 % lurk in the extremities of a house , he says , including corners , in the fabric of the house , in the carpet , behind baseboards , behind wardrobes , and in drawers			0
the house he is investigating in @entity43 , @entity41 is empty			0
the tenants moved out when the first bedbugs appeared , leaving the landlord , who wants to remain anonymous , to deal with the problem			1
wagging her tail and pulling on the leash , @entity6 is ready to work			1
@entity13 gives the command " find your bs " and @entity6 starts sniffing			1
it is in the main bedroom that @entity6 strikes gold			1
next to the wardrobe , she steadies herself with her hind legs and furiously scratches the edge of carpet by the baseboard with her little paws			0
" good girl ! good girl ! " @entity13 shrieks and rewards her with biscuits			0
a few chomps later , @entity6 is off again			1
now that key areas have been identified , @entity13 can have a closer look to assess how bad the problem is			0
" i 'm looking for either bedbug eggs ... feces -- black spots , take a finger over it and see if it smears			1
immediately looking along here ... there 's nothing obvious here ... it could well be they are burrowed deep , " he says			0
" ah ! there you go			0
" the size of this blood - sucker is surprising -- slightly bigger than an apple seed			1
bedbugs go through five stages of its life , shedding their skin twice in each stage , as they fatten up with blood			1
they can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime			0
bedbugs can take 10 to 14 days to hatch and will lay dormant , in some cases up to a year , if they ca n't detect anyone in the room breathing			1
it is the carbon dioxide we exhale that alerts them to come and bite us			0
pest control companies like @entity27 are seeing the number of jobs rocket every year specifically to treat bedbugs			2
@entity110 has seen a 24 % increase in bedbug exterminations in the @entity113 over the past year			2
" it 's becoming more widespread			0
in recent years bedbug numbers have gone up between 100 - 500 % in @entity119 , in @entity120 and in parts of @entity122 and @entity123 " said @entity115 , news editor for the @entity117 magazine			1
" perhaps the reason they 're becoming more widespread is they 've evolved resistance from the normal pesticides that have been used to kill them off , " he speculates			0
the global resurgence of bedbugs is also related the rise in second - hand clothes and furniture shops , and an increase in travel to and from infested regions , typically along the old @entity138 to the far east			1
in the @entity140 , the problem has become bad enough that the @entity141 has convened two summits on the issue			0
the crisis is not likely to subside any time soon , scientists said at the most recent one , earlier this month			0
@entity13 gets rid of bedbugs by transforming the infested house into an oven			2
there are no chemicals involved -- just very hot air			2
that has the advantage of killing all of them , including their eggs , he says			2
working with @entity160 company @entity159 , he heats the house to 134 degrees @entity162 ( 67 degrees @entity163 ) for two to three hours			0
nothing can hide -- bedbugs , lice , mites , cockroaches , he says			2
starting at $ 2,000 for a two - bedroom house , heat treatment is faster and more expensive than chemical sprays , at $ 480			2
chemical treatment is effective but takes up to 21 days to break the life cycle of bedbugs because the chemicals can not kill their eggs			1
with heat , an infested room or house can be treated at 8 in the morning and be bug - free by the evening , @entity13 says			1
that is good news for hotels who do not want to lose money or their reputation			0
" we do get quite a lot of reports of bedbugs , " says @entity185 from the travel website @entity187			2
" of course it 's the hotelier 's responsibility to sort it out -- and quite often if they notice a review that says ' we 've experienced bedbugs , ' they have the opportunity to go on there do a right to reply and we always recommend that , " she says			2
announcing that they have had the hotel fumigated can help reassure potential guests , she adds			0
if you type in " bedbugs " on @entity187 , more than 42,000 results come up -- hotel reviews from disgruntled guests			2
the site , which has more than 40 million hotel reviews , also brings out a " dirtiest hotels " list every year , naming and shaming the worst offenders from @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity122 and @entity218			0
one hotel in the dirtiest @entity221 2011 list had the comment : " 25 bedbugs between the two of us			2
" bedbugs can spoil any holiday or business trip but there are a few myths that need to be dispelled			0
" the biggest myth is that you 've got to be a dirty person to get bed bugs -- it 's absolute rubbish because bedbugs do n't discriminate between rich or poor , dirty or clean			0
i know for a fact five - star hotels suffer from them , right down to your bed and breakfasts , " says @entity13 , adding he has treated seven hotels in @entity0 so far this year			1
and it 's very easy to pick them up , he warns			0
" we put something down ... in a hotel room or somewhere we 're staying that has a high occupancy or common turnover , and they climb on			0
they 're like little hitchhikers , " he says			0
" i 've come out of a hotel with @entity6 and she 's walked passed the baggage in the lobby and spun round and started alerting on somebody 's luggage			1
" if it feels like your hotel room has some unwelcome guests , have a look around the corners of the mattress and the bed frame for those " felt - tip " black spots and rub your finger over them to see if they smear			0
if there are no other rooms available to move into , then the safest place for you and your luggage is the bath -- bedbugs do n't like shiny surfaces .			1

one @entity0 exterminator works with @entity6 , a specially trained bug - finding dog
much of the world is experiencing a rise in bedbug infestations
@entity289 can be more effective than chemicals in killing them
like little hitchhikers , bedbugs can easily catch a ride on clothes or luggage
