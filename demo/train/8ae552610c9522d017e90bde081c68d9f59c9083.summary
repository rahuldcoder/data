@entity16 's death comes despite a public push , including a @entity19 petition signed by about 400,000 people			0
" it would be much easier to isolate or quarantine the dog just as they have the victim 's husband , " the petition stated , rather than forcing @entity26 and her husband to lose " one of the family			2
" @entity26 is a nurse 's assistant at @entity1 's @entity32 hospital , where she is believed to have gotten @entity4 while caring for missionaries being treated for the virus there			1
