-- more than 100 countries attending a conference in @entity4 , @entity1 formally adopted a treaty friday to ban cluster bombs -- a large , unreliable and inaccurate weapon that often affects civilians long after the end of armed conflict			1
cluster bombs are usually air - dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers			1
a document released by @entity1 's @entity15 says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain			1
the countries also agreed never to develop , acquire , retain or transfer cluster munitions			1
countries attending the 11 - day conference agreed to the treaty wednesday but formally signed it friday			1
the accord calls for a total , immediate ban of the weapons , strong standards to protect those injured by them , contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed , he said			2
@entity33 , coordinator of the @entity35 campaigning organization , said wednesday : " this is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons			2
" though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs , including the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord , organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance			1
" take the @entity44 , " @entity33 said			1
" almost all of its allies are here			0
they 've decided to ban these weapons			2
that 's going to make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for the @entity44 to ever use these weapons again , either on its own or in joint operations			1
" the agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years , he said			0
cluster munitions , which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets , are what the @entity68 calls a " persistent humanitarian problem			0
" most of a cluster bomb 's bomblets are meant to explode on impact , but many do not			2
estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time , the @entity76 says			2
that means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area , often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians			0
last week , acting assistant secretary for political - military affairs @entity85 called it " an absolute moral obligation " to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle			0
but he also predicted that the @entity44 would not agree to any ban			1
" we think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions ... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use , " @entity85 said			2
" the @entity44 relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy			2
" instead , he urged that the weapons be regulated " to take humanitarian considerations into account " and that " technological fixes " be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle			0
during the 34 - day war in @entity111 in 2006 , the @entity109 estimated that @entity47 dropped 4 million bomblets , 1 million of which may not have exploded , according to the @entity68			0
more than 250 civilians and bomb - disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern @entity111 since the war ended			0
cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in @entity119			1
lt. col. @entity120 , a military adviser to the @entity121 said they quickly became a major killer of civilians			0
in more than 20 countries , according to the @entity68 , cluster bombs have created lasting " no - go " areas , rendering them as dangerous as minefields			1
@entity128 is the most affected country			0
millions of bomblets dropped during the @entity130 continue to kill civilians more than three decades later			0
still , militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area , such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape			1
a single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles			0
