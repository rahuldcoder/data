-- remember those carefree days when a gallon of gas was only $ 5 ? and when you could cheerfully mail a letter for the rock - bottom price of 50 cents ? just saying those words out loud here to see what they sound like -- just trying to imagine what it will be like , 50 or 60 years from now , when @entity12 who are young today look back over their lives and recall fondly the second decade of the 21st century , when prices were low and reasonable			1
when you could actually buy a gallon of gas for five bucks , or a postage stamp for half a buck			1
back before prices started to soar			0
will it actually happen ? will the once - unheard - of prices we appear headed toward seem someday like great bargains , to be remembered warmly by @entity12 accustomed to paying $ 20 a gallon for gas , and $ 6 to mail a first - class letter ? it seems at the same time impossible and inevitable			1
if , as some experts are predicting , gas hits the unprecedented $ 5 mark this summer , it may have an impact on the presidential campaign			1
@entity0 's @entity34 , speaking on " @entity33 , " said that regardless of the reasons for skyrocketing gas prices -- tension in the @entity42 , the closing of refineries , increased demand for gas during summer vacation season -- " whether it 's fair or not , the @entity12 motoring public has always tended to blame the guy in the @entity37 for high gas prices			2
" yet , political impact in an election year aside , we seem to be about to cross some invisible symbolic line with the possibility of $ 5 - a - gallon gas and 50 - cent first - class stamps , which the @entity55 is recommending			1
it 's the definition of sticker shock , and the question is , will people accept the double whammy as something that just had to happen , or will they feel : too much is at last too much			0
we 've lost our patience			0
economists can make all the arguments they want about adjustments for inflation , but when you recall what gas once sold for , the nostalgia is not so much for a specific price point but for the freedom that came with going out for a long , casual drive without worrying it would break the bank			2
the " @entity79 " song was not directed at a nation nervous about the expense of filling up the tank			0
in 1950 , a gallon of gas cost approximately 27 cents ; by 1970 it had only gone up to approximately 35 cents			1
the highways were just waiting ; as @entity83 sang in his wonderful , if underappreciated , ode to the joys of driving , " @entity86 " : " there was no road too winding and nowhere too far / with two bucks of gas and my old yellow car			0
" you remember your time on @entity93 by the mileposts along the way -- somewhere in the back of your mind , you know the price of gas the first time you ever bought a gallon , and the price of a postage stamp the first time you were aware they existed			1
from 1932 until 1958 , the price of a first - class stamp did n't budge			1
for those 26 years , it was stuck at 3 cents			1
when it finally went up to 4 cents in ' 58 , it was major news			0
when and if a stamp hits 50 cents , no one is really going to have to ask why			2
there are fixed costs to operating the @entity55 , many of them tied to labor , and the funds to support those costs are rapidly drying up in the age of e-mail			0
in the most recent fiscal quarter , the @entity55 lost $ 3.3 billion			0
in that same quarter , the volume of mail sent was down 6 percent from the previous year			0
over the holidays , the @entity125 reported , 1.5 billion holiday cards , the kind people mail to each other , were sold -- down from 2.7 billion as recently as 1995			0
but knowing the reasons the @entity55 needs more money does not erase the fact that the 50 - cent stamp , like the $ 5 gallon of gas , takes us to a place we seldom considered we 'd be			1
and it does n't feel like this is the finish line			2
people get used to anything -- take a look at the price of a cocktail in a big - city restaurant , or a ticket to a major - league baseball game			2
yet some things -- gas , stamps -- do n't qualify as optional , discretionary purchases ; people need them when they need them , which is where the frustration comes in			2
the one - two punch of $ 5 gas and 50 - cent stamps has such powerful symbolism precisely because those two products matter so much to so many people			1
and if the day should ever come when @entity12 look back on the five - buck gallon and the half - buck postage stamp with the same wistful longing that older @entity12 today feel for the 31 - cent gallon and the 3 - cent stamp ... well , that does n't seem possible			1
but , then , neither did this			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			0

in 1950 , a gallon of gas was about 27 cents ; until 1958 , a first - class stamp was 3 cents
some experts are predicting that gas price will hit the unprecedented $ 5 mark soon
@entity173 : we seem to inch closer to an invisible symbolic line with that possibility
@entity173 : do n't be *surprised* if gas and stamp prices hit those numbers
