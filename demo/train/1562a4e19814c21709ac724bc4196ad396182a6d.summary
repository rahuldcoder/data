@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 won the @entity1 league title in extraordinary circumstances saturday courtesy of a draw at @entity0 that denied the @entity9 club the crown			1
in a breathless end to a compelling @entity14 season , the 1 - 1 draw meant @entity3 won their first championship since 1995/96 and in doing so they broke the hearts of the majority of the 98,000 fans present at the @entity20			1
it was the @entity23 defender @entity22 who wrote his name into @entity3 ' folklore , the 28 - year - old rising high to plant a header into the @entity28 net just after halftime and stun the home side who were hoping to win their fourth title in only five seasons			1
but after @entity22 had canceled out @entity36 's fabulous first - half strike for @entity28 , the defending champions could find no way back against a team which has defied the odds for most of the season			1
now @entity41 will turn their attentions to the unlikeliest of doubles as they face city rivals @entity45 in a mouthwatering @entity47 final in @entity48 next saturday			1
as a result they will not have long to celebrate this triumph , but it is nevertheless one of huge significance as it has broken the stranglehold @entity0 and @entity45 have enjoyed over the rest of @entity14 for a decade			2
the last time neither of the biggest two teams finished top of the pile was in 2003/04 , when @entity60 beat @entity28 to the title			0
@entity28 , in truth , looked a shadow of the side that has dominated @entity1 football for half a decade			2
after a season of turmoil on and off the pitch , @entity67 's side simply did not have the tactical nous or energy with which to overpower an @entity3 team who refused to bow to their more illustrious opponents			1
it has been a chastening few months for @entity0			0
president @entity78 resigned in january after allegations surrounding the acquisition of @entity82 forward @entity81 last summer , former coach @entity77 tragically passed away in april and club lynchpins @entity83 and @entity85 have said their goodbyes as they leave the @entity20 for pastures new			0
all the while @entity28 have struggled on the pitch after a superb start to the season , exiting the @entity47 at the hands of @entity3 and losing the @entity94 final to @entity45 in april , in the meantime letting the title slip out of their grasp when it was theirs to lose after a 4 - 3 win at @entity45 in march			1
down to the wire it was the league no - one could win as @entity28 , @entity45 and @entity103 all threw away points in the final few weeks of the season ; the underdogs from @entity3 blowing their first chance to win the title outright when they were held 1 - 1 at home by @entity111 last weekend while @entity28 were drawing 0 - 0 in @entity112			1
but when it came down to saturday 's once - in - a - lifetime showdown at one of the great cathedrals in world sport , @entity3 did not fluff their lines , instead producing a performance that owed more to glorious guts and determination than the glamorous ' tiki - taka ' style with which @entity28 have won trophies and hearts aplenty in recent years			2
and in a league that swung from @entity0 to @entity45 to @entity3 and back all season long , it was no surprise that the once - in - a - lifetime final day showdown saved some of its best twists and turns for the dramatic denouement			1
going into the @entity20 contest @entity41 were three points ahead of @entity28 and knew a draw would be enough ; @entity28 needed to win and they would take the title by virtue of a better head - to - head record , which is how the final standings in @entity1 are determined			1
in glorious sunshine @entity28 began brighter and @entity41 were soon rocked by injuries to two of their most decisive players , as first talismanic striker @entity145 -- reportedly on his way to @entity147 in the summer -- and then classy midfielder @entity148 limped off in tears at the prospect of their seasons being curtailed so cruelly			0
when @entity36 seized on a @entity153 chest pass in the @entity103 box after 33 minutes and rifled a ferocious right - foot shot into the roof of the net from an audacious angle , suddenly @entity28 were the ones in the driving seat			0
but they were also suddenly the ones with everything to lose , and @entity3 had clearly not come so far to be denied			0
it was the first time @entity28 had led @entity41 in a match since february 2012 , seven meetings ago , and they looked uncomfortable doing so as the visitors took the game to them with renewed gusto			0
heading into history books at the start of the second half they came out like a train , and after @entity173 -- who won the title with @entity28 last year -- struck the base of the post , @entity22 rose majestically to score the goal his career and this most remarkable of seasons will be remembered for			2
if @entity3 looked like they had thrown it away before they were not going to make the same mistake again			0
@entity81 entered the fray for @entity28 and he gave them a much greater attacking potency , but @entity185 has his team playing in his own image and they blocked and tackled and leaped and chased as if their very lives depended on it			0
@entity153 had a goal rightly ruled out for offside and @entity192 stung the palms of @entity194 in the @entity196 goal but they allowed @entity28 no closer and as the minutes ticked down , the illogical turned into the inevitable			0
the 480 - strong band of @entity41 fans -- parked right up in the gods at the imposing @entity20 -- sung their hearts out , and when the final whistle came and their coaching staff raced on to the pitch to celebrate , the players collapsed as one to the turf in collective disbelief at what they had just done			0
in the face of such heartbreak , the reaction from the @entity28 fans was magical -- they stood to a man to applaud the team that had just deposed them as @entity1 champions and even sang " @entity218 , @entity41 " as the players rose to their feet to acknowledge what was happening around them			0
if winning the league with a playing budget one - fifth the size of @entity28 's and @entity45 's is a modern day fairy tale in a sport where money increasingly talks , then this finale was pure @entity227			2
in @entity228 next saturday , the brilliant @entity185 will hope to cause yet another mighty upset and write one final , captivating chapter in the remarkable story of @entity3 's season .			1

@entity3 crowned champions of @entity1 following 1 - 1 draw against @entity0
@entity22 's second - half goal at @entity20 seals a first league title in 18 years
@entity3 will go for a historic double in @entity47 final next weekend
