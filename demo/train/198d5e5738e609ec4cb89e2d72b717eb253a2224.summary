at the end of the dinner and before the guests returned to the presidential guest lodge , @entity10 said she heard a discussion about getting diamonds to @entity5 later that night			1
@entity2 was present for " at least part " of the discussion , she said			2
@entity34 : @entity5 said diamond was from @entity2 late that night , before she or @entity5 had gone to bed , @entity10 said men in suits threw pebbles at her second - floor window to get her attention			1
they said they had a gift for @entity5			2
she said she went to @entity5 's room and told her , but @entity8 disputed her account			1
" i suggest you 're a liar , " he told @entity10 in court			0
" and i suggest that this account of what happened that night is a complete fabrication			0
" continuing the story , @entity10 said she and @entity5 went downstairs and opened the doors of the guest lodge to let the men in			1
" i think she was quite excited that , finally , these diamonds had arrived , " @entity10 said of @entity5			1
@entity57 : @entity26 's ' blood ' diamond shame the supermodel testified last week that two men knocked on her door while she was sleeping and gave her a pouch , saying it was a gift			0
she said she opened the pouch the next morning to find " dirty - looking stones " that turned out to be diamonds			0
@entity10 testified tuesday , however , that that account did n't make sense , because the men needed access through the main lodge door before knocking at a guest 's room , and there had been no one else downstairs to let them in			2
it was 1 or 2 a.m. and no staff or guards were downstairs in the guest lodge , she said			0
@entity8 asked @entity10 whether she told her famous client that she should n't have accepted a gift from two strange men in the middle of the night			0
@entity10 said she did n't do that until the morning			0
@entity5 's friend turns over diamonds to police " when i woke up in the morning , i thought about it and decided that i definitely knew it was very illegal to take diamonds out of @entity26 , " she said			1
" i do n't know how i knew that , but i knew it , and so i had a conversation with @entity5 -- most likely in her bedroom because i would have been getting her up -- and i told her that i did n't think that those diamonds should go out of @entity26			1
" @entity10 said she suggested @entity5 give the diamonds to a charity			1
@entity5 testified last week that she did not know the diamonds were from @entity2			1
she said she passed the stones to a friend , @entity102 , a trustee of the @entity103			0
she said she asked him to use the stones in a charity auction to raise money for underprivileged children			0
the @entity103 denied last week that it had ever received diamonds from @entity5			1
a police official testified friday that @entity102 had given the diamonds to @entity26 police hours after @entity5 testified about them			2
@entity2 , 62 , was president of @entity3 from 1997 to 2003			2
the war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder , rape and mutilation that occurred during the civil war in @entity19 , fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill , given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior and were often instructed to rape and plunder			0
@entity5 testifies at @entity2 war crimes trial the trial is taking place at the @entity129 - backed @entity128 , at @entity130 , @entity131			2

prosecutors had rested their case against @entity2 in february 2009 but reopened it to call @entity5 to testify after learning @entity2 had given the supermodel a diamond			2
when arguing to reopen the case , prosecutors said @entity5 's testimony would prove that the former president " used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases , " according to papers filed with the @entity129 - backed court			1
@entity2 has testified that he never handled the precious stones			0
the men who dropped off the diamonds to @entity5 never said they represented @entity2 , @entity10 testified , but @entity5 was clear about who they had come from , @entity10 said			1

at breakfast the next morning , @entity34 said , @entity5 told her the men had been sent by @entity2 and had given her a " huge diamond			2
" it was unclear why @entity34 spoke of a single diamond and @entity5 testified about several smaller ones			0
@entity8 summed up his questioning tuesday with an attack on @entity10 's testimony			1
" quite frankly , mrs. @entity10 , i suggest that your account is a complete pack of lies , and you 've made it up in order to assist in your lawsuit against ms. @entity5 , " he said			1
" put bluntly , for you this is all about money , there ai n't nothing funny			0
i have no further questions			0
" one of the judges then told a stunned @entity10 that she must respond , even though @entity8 had not prompted her			0
" i can categorically tell your honor it 's not a lie , " @entity10 said			2
i have told people after the journey in ' 97 -- people that i trusted -- this story , because it was quite funny at the time , although it 's not so funny now			0
" it 's totally the truth			0
it has nothing whatsoever to do with my business argument with @entity5 , and i do n't really see the relevance of the gentleman 's argument			2
but this is not about money , this is about a very serious matter , and i am telling the truth			0
" @entity8 said in court last week that @entity10 launched a lawsuit against @entity5 in october for breach of contract .			1
