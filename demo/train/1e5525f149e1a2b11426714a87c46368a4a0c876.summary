-- cyber criminals are setting snares that move at the speed of news			1
savvy cyber criminals are taking advantage of our increasing reliance on computers and the @entity10			1
@entity11 , a @entity12 - based antivirus maker , has been monitoring an onslaught of links with malicious software , or " malware , " on @entity16 that tag hot topics such as the @entity20 crash , the @entity22 finals , " @entity23 " runner - up @entity24 and the new @entity26			1
" cyber criminals have been targeting @entity16 users by creating thousands of messages ( tweets ) embedded with words involving trending topics and malicious urls , " @entity28 - @entity27 , a threat researcher for @entity11 , wrote recently on a blog for the company			1
the growing sophistication of malware attacks mirrors the growing threat -- and cash -- generated by online crime			1
already , cyber crime is estimated to cost companies and consumers more than $ 100 billion worldwide			1
some officials claim it has now eclipsed illegal drugs as a criminal moneymaker			1
" it 's very seldom reported ... if discovered by companies , they generally do n't want the public to know they 've been had , " said @entity50 , a computer security specialist at @entity52 who has advised two @entity55 presidents and numerous companies and government agencies			1
cyber crime is one of the few industries benefiting from the financial crisis			1
last year , antivirus maker @entity66 saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined			1
in the @entity55 , the @entity71 reported a 33 percent increase in internet crime last year			2
companies lost an average of $ 4.6 million in intellectual property last year , according to a survey of 1000 firms worldwide by @entity52 and @entity66			2
" as the economy has declined , we 've seen the threat landscape increase , " @entity79 , president and ceo of @entity66 , recently told @entity81 for @entity83 's " @entity82			0
" that increase has helped antivirus makers such as @entity66 snare record returns -- the company 's first quarter profits were 21 percent higher than same period last year			0
but companies and governments find themselves in a losing war with @entity96 - savvy criminals , experts say			2
" the fundamental fact is cyber criminals are highly organized with sophisticated corporate structures and business chains , " said @entity97 , director of the @entity98 at the @entity99 in @entity100			2
" they have r&d departments , strong distribution networks and web sites for the discerning cyber criminal , " @entity97 said			1
on these web sites , would - be criminals can purchase toolkits to learn how to side step security measures or create their own " botnet " -- referring to software that can , unbeknownst to victims , turn their computers into spamming foot - soldiers for criminal networks			1
one web site advertises software that can capture information for a popular internet secured - payment provider for $ 500 -- discounted to $ 400 for the first 100 buyers			1
skimmed credit card numbers and other personal - identity information stolen from computers also can be found for sale on web sites , @entity97 said			1
" when police shut these web sites down , they just mushroom up some other place , " he said			1
although the techniques of cyber crime have evolved , online criminals prey on human vulnerabilities like criminals throughout the ages			1
in the digital age , that means tempting with free downloads , money schemes and pornography			2
the range of tools used by cyber criminals reveals the quick evolution of the industry			2
viruses -- the first generation of the computer culprits -- are used for the computer equivalent of vandalism , as the malicious programs replicate , spread and damage computers			2
" when the company was set up , we were seeing two or three new viruses a week , " said @entity155 , chief financial officer of @entity157 - based antivirus maker @entity156			2
" now there 's a new one every two - and - a - half seconds			0
" with the arrival of spam in 2001 and 2002 , the big difference was it was commercial malware , " @entity155 said			0
" once money became involved , the level of sophistication raised a hundred-fold			2
" now the biggest threats include " phishing " schemes and " botnet " attacks			0
phishing is where criminals masquerade as a legitimate business or web site and trick victims into revealing passwords , credit card information and other personal data			1
botnet attackers commandeer personal computers as part of a large network of " zombie " computers that , on command , target companies for spam attacks to cripple it capabilities			2
botnets -- some of which are large enough to deploy tens of billions of spam e-mails a day -- are often used in extortion schemes			0
" they ring up the it manager of a company and say , ' pay us a million or we 'll take you down ' , " said @entity97 , who has worked with companies victimized by botnet attacks			0
companies often pay up and shut up , computer experts say , rather than report the crime and garner publicity that may hurt their corporate reputation			1
and unlike prankster virus - makers , these malware makers are determined to stay hidden			0
" once it became a business , then ( cyber criminals ) began to look at what companies like us were doing , and figure out weaknesses , " he said			1
" they are very customer friendly ... they sell updates , they will highlight what the product does and what antivirus software ca n't detect them			0
adding to the difficulty is the legal situation that in many jurisdictions , it is not illegal to create or sell malware			0
" it 's like the arms industry ... it 's not a crime to build and sell them , " @entity155 said			0
and because of the transnational nature of the crime , it 's extremely difficult to prosecute			0
a scan of 500 headlines on @entity10 - related arrests from newspapers around the world the past two years found about 90 percent were related to child - pornography cases			0
" child pornography is easier to prosecute because it is possible to find the evidence on the perpetrator 's computer systems , " said @entity50 of @entity52			0
cyber-criminal networks are as porous as the internet itself			0
" there are multiple jurisdictions and unless it 's an ongoing crime that uses the same path all the time , the trail goes cold quickly , " @entity50 said			0
" i may be able to trace back to a computer system , if i 'm lucky , or trace it back to a cyber cafe -- but how do i know who was behind it ? " often criminal networks are run in countries such as @entity266 and @entity267 , where government officials turn a blind eye to these activities -- so long as their victims reside outside the host country , @entity50 said			1
" for the host countries , that 's dangerous ... it 's kind of like breeding tigers in the back yard and saying , ' well , they have n't hurt anyone here yet , ' " he said			0
" @entity281 is a wonderful example ... they tolerated drug smugglers for years , and now it 's such a major problem and incredibly painful and costly to run them out			0
" i 'm not saying ( cyber criminals ) are involved in physical violence , but it 's not out of the realm of possibility , " he said			0
" what are they doing with all that money ? "			0

some officials say cyber crime has eclipsed drug trade as a money maker
latest ploy is planting malicious software in intriguing @entity16 topics
some companies give in to extortion and remain *silent* , officials say
skimmed credit card numbers can be found for sale on web sites
