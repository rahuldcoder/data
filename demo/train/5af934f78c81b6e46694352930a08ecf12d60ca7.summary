-- the mere rumor of a downgrade by the major ratings agencies is enough to send world markets into a tailspin , wiping billions off the values of global stocks			1
so what do ratings agencies do , and why are they so important ? who are the credit ratings agencies ? the " @entity15 " are @entity12 's , @entity13 and @entity14			1
all originated in the @entity16 , although @entity14 has dual headquarters in @entity18 and @entity19			0
what do they do ? before you can get a credit card , banks run a credit check on you			0
similarly , the ratings agencies run credit checks on companies , countries and financial products			1
countries are rated on a sliding scale : @entity34 for example , has a top rating ( @entity36 ) which allows it to borrow cash at cheap interest rates			0
the lower the rating grade , however , the higher interest payments a nation must pay to attract investors to buy its bonds			0
anything that slips to junk status -- as @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity49 government bonds are rated -- is considered a " highly speculative " investment			0
furthermore , the pool of eligible investors is reduced -- many institutional investors , such as government pension funds , are forbidden to invest in junk - rated bonds			0
why do they wield such power ? investors across the world look to credit rating agencies to judge where to place their bets in the market			1
for governments , the ratings agencies have a lot of power over the popularity of bonds : cash given to governments by investors that , over time , will pay a return on the original investment -- unless the government defaults			1
what does a debt rating downgrade mean ? the decisions of the " @entity15 " catalyze market moves in often unpredictable ways , creating a strong ripple effect			2
in the wake of the @entity49 downgrade last year , for example , investors across the globe started rethinking investment in other governments ' bonds and began selling off more risky investments -- throwing the @entity93 into crisis and depressing the value of the euro			0
when the @entity16 was downgraded from a top rating to a step below best investment grade last august , the market reaction was fierce			2
at the start of august , the @entity101 was trading at 12,000 ; by august 10 , days after the downgrade , the @entity101 dipped below 10,800			0
there was a similar psychological ripple through the markets after @entity13 's downgrades of @entity46 and @entity47			0
how are ratings agencies paid ? historically , they were created to give investors an unbiased assessment of investments and investors paid for access to the ratings			2
in the 1970s , however , credit rating agencies started charging the issuers of new investments fees for ratings			2
in 1975 , @entity16 legislators -- fearing a proliferation of unscrupulous ratings agencies -- designated @entity123 's , @entity13 's and @entity14 as the only ratings organizations banks and brokers could use to evaluate the credit worthiness of their products			1
what are the complaints against the firms ? critics complain the agencies have lost their ability to independently judge the risk on certain investments			1
credit ratings agencies had a starring role in the financial crisis , after the firms blessed mortgage - backed securities with @entity36 ratings -- the safest rating possible -- and fed the global mania for these risky investments			1
critics also note that the agencies are paid by the very entities they rate , raising questions about their trustworthiness			0
there are moves afoot in @entity152 to have more stringent regulation on credit ratings agencies			1
and the agencies were dealt a blow in a @entity16 court last month when a @entity16 district judge @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 , rejected " free speech " as an argument in a case against the @entity15 credit ratings agencies brought by investors who lost investment in mortgage - backed securities			1
the ratings agencies often invoke @entity170 right regarding questions about their ratings -- they are simply stating an opinion			2
it 's up to the markets to decide for themselves what to do with that information .			0
