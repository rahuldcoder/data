@entity0 -- more than two months of floods and 8 million people affected -- the disaster in @entity5 is immense ; the aid effort a challenge			1
much of the effort appears to be internally driven			1
@entity9 across the country are donating food , water and clothing to help their countrymen in the worst - hit areas			1
donations have far surpassed previous years			2
floods happen every year here , but these are the worst in half a century and have left at least 283 dead			1
the @entity5 military and aid groups share the responsibility of distributing the life - saving supplies			1
in the ancient city of @entity26 , one of the worst - hit regions , military trucks move slowly down the main street , cutting through a constant river of water , passing out aid to those who can get close			1
anyone who has a boat is using it to transport aid or to help neighbors carrying their possessions as water levels rise and engulf homes			1
those who do n't have a boat are making do with rubber tires or even slabs of @entity46			0
there is a true sense of teamwork between the communities			0
the @entity0 suburb of @entity52 is sandwiched between the overflowing @entity53 and the 2.5 - meter floodwalls that are so far successfully protecting the inner and commercial part of the capital			0
the water here has nowhere to go and levels are rising fast			1
@entity61 , 60 , has had to move into the local temple as his house is completely submerged			1
he says the situation is dire and help is not getting there fast enough to those who do n't live on the main street			0
" it 's very bad around here , " he told @entity1			0
" we do n't have enough to eat			0
" temples are playing a significant role in the disaster			1
@entity5 is overwhelmingly @entity80 and many temples , although flooded themselves , have some dry floors on higher ground and have opened their doors to those in need			1
@entity86 says it will take a long time to fix the waterlogged temple where @entity90 is staying			0
@entity91 sit in stagnant water along what was once a river bank			2
the worry is if the water does n't recede soon , the damage to these historic monuments could be permanent			2
but @entity86 's first concern is helping his community , many of whom are now sleeping in the temple			0
" whenever we get donations , we share it all with the villagers , " he says			0
the international community is responding to the disasters playing out across @entity5			0
@entity109 has donated $ 1.5 million and the @entity110 $ 1 million			2
the @entity110 is also sending 26 helicopters to help the relief effort , invaluable as more roads turn to rivers and become impassable			2
@entity116 agencies also are on standby , activating their assessment teams and contingency planning in @entity5 , @entity119 and @entity120 , according to the @entity121			0
the @entity122 has offered emergency health kits .			0

8 million people are affected by the floods , which have killed 283 people
@entity9 are leading the aid effort , providing their countrymen with food , water and clothing
temples have become a place of *refuge* for those whose homes are submerged
