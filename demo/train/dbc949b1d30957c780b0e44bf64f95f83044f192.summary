-- @entity1 tried to help struggling student - athletes at the @entity3 learn to read			1
first it was just one case , then another and another			0
seeing a bigger problem , @entity1 researched the reading abilities of football and basketball players at the @entity11 campus , and then raised the alarm when she found many with only elementary school literacy , so low they were unable to follow college courses			1
the @entity16 selected @entity1 in april as the 10th recipient of an award recognizing university faculty or staff who speak out about academic integrity at their institutions			2
many of them risked their jobs doing it			0
one of the earliest whistle - blowers was @entity29 , who in the early 1980s exposed the @entity30 for allowing football players who failed a remedial @entity33 class to play in a bowl game			1
" there is no real sound academic reason for their being here other than to be utilized to produce income			0
" @entity29 told @entity39 in 1986			1
" they are used as a kind of raw material in the production of some goods to be sold ... and they get nothing in return			0
" she was demoted and then fired , and the trauma led her to attempt suicide twice in the 1980s , once by stabbing herself in the chest with a butcher knife			1
she also sued @entity30 officials , saying she was terminated unlawfully , and won compensatory and punitive damages from a jury			2
she was later reinstated at the university and @entity30 later tightened academic standards for its athletes , the @entity57 reported in 2008			2
she was the @entity16 's first honoree in 2004			0
the group , an organization of educators and activists who push for academic reform , now annually awards its @entity66 on faculty who stand up for academic integrity			0
@entity29 died four years later , her son told @entity70 as reported by the @entity57 , of complications from alzheimer 's disease			1
the harassment that haunted @entity29 has happened to several others since			1
in the late 1990s , @entity75 was in a similar position at @entity77 -- an @entity33 teacher who saw tutors doing far too much work for athletes who were far too under - prepared for college coursework			1
in 2003 , after years of hate mail and verbal attacks , she decided to leave @entity77 because death threats mentioned her children			1
@entity75 said she was treated so badly she had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder , â € @entity89 when she resigned , she told the university in her resignation letter : " no faculty member should ever find her attempts to do her job met with institutional threats and public attacks on her character			2
" @entity77 , when contacted by @entity0 , would not say whether it still uses the system that @entity75 alleged was in place -- where a school psychologist would diagnose learning - disabled athletes and put them in a program that allowed them to forgo graduation requirements all other students had to meet			1
" many of the records i looked at revealed that these athletes came to us essentially illiterate and still left the school functionally illiterate			0
in 2009 , @entity111 , adjunct lecturer at @entity112 , told the @entity57 she was pressured to change her grading policy for basketball players who were missing classes			0
about seven months later , she was fired , and the @entity57 reported that @entity111 felt it was because she spoke out			2
the university denied that charge			0
@entity119 instructor @entity118 settled a lawsuit with the school in 2005 after alleging she was told to change grades to keep football players eligible for a bowl game			0
@entity119 admitted to some @entity126 violations in the early 2000s , and the probe went away			2
then - coach @entity128 said publicly that he knew of no cheating			0
then - chancellor @entity130 -- now the president of the @entity126 -- said at the time @entity132 and another whistle - blower were tying personal issues to @entity126 violations.â € Ž @entity1 said that since she began speaking out about what she saw at the @entity3 , she has felt harassed by the university			1
she took her grievances to a peer panel at @entity3 , but they found no evidence of retaliation.â € Ž read more from @entity1 and what @entity0 found " it 's very sad that people like @entity75 , @entity1 and others , who are dedicated to higher education , have to be subjected to this kind of intimidation for merely doing their jobs , " said @entity141 , director of the @entity16 .			0
