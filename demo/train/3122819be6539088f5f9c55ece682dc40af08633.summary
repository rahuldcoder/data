@entity0 are looking to turn up the heat on @entity2 rep. @entity2 as he heads into the final days of his runoff battle with @entity5 sen. @entity4 with two ethics complaints focused on his work at @entity8			1
both a @entity5 citizen affiliated with the @entity10 and the @entity11 filed complaints with the @entity13 on wednesday alleging that @entity2 's work for the university violates multiple ethics rules and guidelines and calling for an investigation			1
the @entity11 complaint , obtained by @entity20 , alleges that @entity2 failed to receive required approval from the @entity22 to engage in teaching activities from 2011 - 2014			1
lawmakers are banned from receiving any " honoraria " — meaning a payment for an appearance , speech or article — while serving in office , but teaching activities are exempt from that ban			0
the complaint against @entity2 also argues that his work for @entity8 did not meet the requirements to be considered teaching work , and thus was n't exempt from the ban			1
instead , it argues , his work amounts essentially to " medical services , " and so the stipend he received from @entity8 for his teaching services should be considered compensation in violation of @entity22 rules			2
that stipend was also , the complaint alleges , inappropriately left off of his personal disclosure forms			0
and it also argues that @entity2 received compensation from @entity8 for months when he did n't put in any hours there , meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the $ 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to			2
the @entity10 complaint outlines similar concerns			0
@entity2 's campaign did not respond to a request for comment			0
it 's an effort from @entity0 to highlight a late - breaking controversy surrounding @entity2 's employment with the school			1
documents published last week by a number of local @entity5 political blogs suggest @entity2 might have billed the school for more hours of work than he completed			0
@entity2 and his campaign advisers have pushed back against the allegations , arguing they 're entirely baseless and simply an effort from @entity4 's campaign to try overcome some of the deep deficit she faces in the polls			1
she 's considered a serious underdog in saturday 's showdown			2
@entity4 's campaign has vehemently denied that it had anything to do with the documents coming to light , but @entity82 , an @entity8 professor and veteran @entity5 political reporter , told @entity20 on tuesday he had heard from multiple news outlets in @entity5 that @entity0 operatives had been shopping the documents around for at least a month , and found no takers			1
he said despite the continuing developments in the situation , he thought it was too late in the race for it to change the tide			0
" it 's one of those things that i think just happened a little too late to really make a difference			0
it almost feels like last - minute desperation kind of stuff , " he said .			0
