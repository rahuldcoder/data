-- the ruler of @entity4 's prestigious @entity3 operation in @entity5 is at the center of a major doping scandal after 11 of the stable 's horses failed drugs tests			1
@entity3 said @entity11 was " absolutely appalled " after regulator @entity12 ( @entity12 ) found anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- in 11 samples taken from 45 horses from its @entity19 stable in eastern @entity20 on april 9			1
" i deeply regret what has happened , " said @entity3 trainer @entity21 , who now faces a @entity12 disciplinary inquiry , in a statement by @entity3			1
" i have made a catastrophic error			0
because the horses involved were not racing at the time , i did not realize that what i was doing was in breach of the rules of racing			0
" i can only apologize for the damage this will cause to @entity3 and to racing generally			2
" anabolic steroids work on horses as they do on humans -- helping to build strength and muscle			2
@entity39 was still legal as recently as 2008 , when @entity40 won the @entity41 and the @entity42 in the @entity43 after having regular injections			0
his trainer 's admission , and the subsequent outcry , led to the drug being widely banned			2
however , it is still legal for out - of - competition use in @entity51 , such as helping to overcome injuries			0
'' any horse that has been treated with anabolic steroids must be free of them by race day , " @entity54 vet dr @entity53 told the @entity55 on tuesday in reaction to monday 's @entity3 announcement			1
@entity3 is one of the world 's most successful stables , with more than 2,000 race wins since it was formed in 1992			2
it has been named champion @entity5 owner eight times , including last year , while @entity11 and his family have also taken the title on multiple occasions going back to the 1980s			2
@entity3 's @entity72 , unbeaten in four career outings and winner of the @entity75 at @entity19 last september , was one of the horses to test positive and will not be allowed to take part in the @entity79 at @entity19 next month			1
" @entity21 has been advised of the analysts ' findings and has been visited by an investigating officer , " said @entity80 , @entity81 for the @entity12			0
former @entity87 winner @entity85 was another horse to test positive			1
@entity85 was ridden to victory in that race by @entity90 , who worked for the @entity3 team for 18 years , but is now serving a six - month ban for doping			1
urgent review " this is a dark day for @entity3 , " said the @entity5 stable 's racing manager @entity95			1
" we are all shocked by what has happened			0
his highness @entity11 was absolutely appalled when he was told and this is completely unacceptable to him			0
" we will await the outcome of the @entity12 inquiry before taking any further internal action			0
" @entity11 has instructed me to begin an urgent review of all of our procedures and controls			0
that is already underway and we will take advice from the @entity12 in completing it			0
" the @entity12 said the disciplinary hearing will take place at the " first available opportunity			1
" " @entity117 and stanozolol are anabolic steroids and therefore prohibited substances under @entity5 @entity121 , at any time -- either in training or racing , " added @entity80 , outlining the sport 's doping rules on the @entity12 's website			1
" the horses which have produced positive tests will also not be permitted to race with immediate effect and for an extended period of time			1
" as part of the ongoing process , a decision will be made as to what period this suspension will be imposed for			0
" the @entity12 understands the importance of this process being carried out as quickly as possible because of implications for betting markets			0
" @entity21 joined @entity3 in march 2010 and won the @entity138 , one of @entity5 's five classics , in his first season			1
" news reports so far suggest this case is an aberration and is not indicative of wider use of anabolic steroids in @entity5 horse racing , " said @entity143 chief executive @entity142 .			2
