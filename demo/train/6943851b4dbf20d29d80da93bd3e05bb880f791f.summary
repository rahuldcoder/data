-- you 've heard @entity3 's songs			1
" after midnight " was done most famously by @entity4			2
" cocaine , " too			0
@entity5 had a hit with " @entity7 , " @entity9 did " @entity8 , " @entity10 performed " @entity11 , " and @entity12 has done " @entity13			0
" and you 've heard @entity3 's sound			1
it 's a distinctive groove , a smooth - shuffling gait that calls to mind a bluesier @entity17			1
@entity4 emulates it on many of his late - ' 70s records , such as " @entity21 " and " promises , " and it runs like a golden seam through several @entity25 records -- no surprise , since @entity27 's a fan			1
but you may not have heard @entity3 himself			1
oh , he won a @entity29 ( with @entity4 ) for his 2006 album , " @entity31			2
" and his new album , " @entity32 " ( @entity33 ) , has earned plenty of praise -- " ' roll on ' finds @entity3 back in vintage form , " said the @entity38 -- and even a little airplay on satellite and internet radio			1
click on the photo to hear @entity3 at work but @entity3 , 70 , has never had a hit , and he 's primarily known as a musician 's musician			1
on a recent 2Â½ - week tour , which wraps up april 15 , he mainly played 700 - seat clubs and theaters , and when it 's done , he 'll go back home to his house " on a couple acres in the boonies " north of @entity54 , @entity55 , he says			1
he likes it that way			0
a new album " is all mainly dictated by whoever 's doing my business end of it			1
every time i make an album , i go , ' that 's the last one , ' " the native @entity62 said in a voice as rich and peppery as barbecue sauce			1
" that 's somebody else 's idea to make a record and go out and play			2
i generally do n't go out and tour much anymore -- never did , much			0
i do n't really hustle that			0
... on a good day , i 'm feeling good , i say i 'll make another record and go on tour , and on a bad day , i 'll say , ' what have i committed myself to ? ' " the house , he said , " is quiet			0
and i 'm a musician			0
that 's what i like about it			2
" it 's a good place for the one - time audio engineer to tinker and compose , though he says he 's not conscious of creating the @entity3 sound			1
" it 's all accident , " he said			2
" i never know what i 'm doing			0
writing songs , you start with a clean piece of paper , so you just start screwing with it			0
most of the stuff you write , and sometimes even when you 're finished , you go , ' that ai n't worth a damn , ' but you do n't throw it away			0
" on " @entity32 , " the groove works in mysterious ways			1
" who knew , " the opening track , gains an ominous intensity : " who knew / not me , not you or anyone else / come to think of it , it 's true / we 're misinformed and always warned to look out / who knew , " he sings , a lonely sax moaning behind his voice			2
( listen to " who knew " in the @entity110 box under @entity3 's photo			1
) but the groove gives a touch of wistfulness to " down to @entity115 " and even a little dance - funk to " @entity117			1
" @entity3 comes by the variety honestly : he remembers his formative years as soaking in a brew of country , jazz and early rock ' n ' roll			1
" i 'm so old , i can remember before rock ' n ' roll come along , " he recalled			0
" when i was a young fellow , i played guitar for other people , so i 'd have to learn [ cover tunes ]			0
... so the guitar players on all those early recordings , i guess , influenced what i did			0
i never could get it exactly right the way they played it , and i guess that helped the style that evolved			0
" in 1964 , @entity3 and his friend @entity136 -- along with bassist @entity137 , later of @entity138 -- decided to try their luck in @entity141			1
@entity136 quickly became an in - demand session man , but @entity3 did n't meet with the same success and soon returned to @entity62			1
but he kept writing and recording , and after @entity136 signed him to his label , @entity147 , " after midnight " found its way to @entity4			2
the song hit the @entity150 in 1970 , and @entity3 was suddenly in demand			1
he 's put out albums every two or three years since then , but he 's just as happy to have others cover his material , particularly @entity4			2
" [ his ] recording all those songs has really helped me pay my rent , ' cause he sells a lot of records , " he chuckled			0
after more than 50 years making music , he still seems a little surprised by success , even at his under - the - radar level			2
" i was mainly entertaining myself and still am , " he said			0
" making music is fun if you forget about you 're doing it as a commercial thing			0
and i never did think that			0
a couple things became commercial , and that came as a surprise			0
" which has allowed him to keep playing and keep tinkering			0
and to keep being @entity3 , creating that groove			1
" when i approach [ a new recording ] , i always think i 'm going to sound different than @entity3 , to surprise people , " he said			1
" and when i get through , it just sounds like me , and there 's nothing i can do about it			2

@entity3 is *legend* among musicians ; wrote " after midnight , " " @entity182 "
guitarist has a distinctive , much - emulated bluesy groove
@entity3 's new album is " @entity32 , " another distinctive *collection*
