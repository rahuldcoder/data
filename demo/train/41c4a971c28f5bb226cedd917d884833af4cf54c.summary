-- the unexplained beachings of scores of dolphins over the past month along @entity5 , @entity6 , is the largest " single - species event " of its kind on record in the northeastern @entity10 , a marine mammal specialist said monday			1
a total of 129 common dolphins have been found since the animals began stranding themselves in early january , said @entity15 , marine mammal rescue and research manager for the @entity18			1
team members have been able to successfully release 37 of the 54 they were able to recover alive , but 75 others were dead or had to be euthanized on the spot , for a total of 92 dead , @entity15 told reporters in a conference call			2
specially equipped trailers have been used to treat and transport the living dolphins			2
the ones that are healthy enough are taken to the outer @entity5 coast to be released			2
nine of the dolphins have been tagged with satellite tracking devices , @entity15 said , and most of the six that are still transmitting are north of @entity5 , " where dolphins should be			1
" while dolphin strandings are not uncommon on the cape , @entity15 said this event is extraordinary in its " protracted " nature as well as the number of dolphins involved			1
" we 've seen see an ( annual ) average of 228 strandings of dolphins and seals over the past 12 years " in the @entity18 's @entity47 , which spans from @entity48 to @entity49 , @entity15 said			1
" there is a large variability year to year , " she said , but this event represents " more than half my annual average in a month			0
" @entity15 said the @entity18 staffs a 24 - hour hotline , and when they get reports " from beach - goers or anyone who finds an animal , " they alert one of their 300 trained volunteers and dispatch them to the scene			1
these responders are able to relay information about the dolphin 's species , sex and condition			2
once beached , a dolphin is vulnerable to predators and susceptible to organ damage and sunburn			0
if a dolphin is still alive , the responders get it onto its stomach , if it is not already , for easier breathing , keep away seagulls that would otherwise peck at it , and warm it with blankets or cool it with water as necessary , @entity15 said			2
necropsies have been performed on nine of the dolphins , and blood and microbial swab samples have been taken from some that were found alive , @entity15 said , but so far no pattern of disease or trauma has been found that would point to a cause			1
although the winter and early spring are the normal time of year for dolphin strandings to occur , the weather this season has been unusually warm , leading to speculation about climate change and subsequent " distribution of prey " as a possible causes			0
last week , @entity107 harbormaster @entity105 explained that usually , in the winter , " the harbor ices over and inhibits the animals from coming close to the shore			0
but now that the water is warmer , we 're seeing lots more dolphins washing up than ever before			0
" however , the @entity18 's @entity15 cautioned , while climate or other external factors such as acoustic disorientation ca n't be ruled out , " we do n't have a single answer			1
" " as time goes on we can put more of the pieces of the puzzle together , " she said			0
" the sad fact in these events is that we often never come up with that answer , and that is incredibly frustrating			0
" she did , however cite the nature of the dolphins and the geology of @entity5 as two contributing factors in these events , historically : " common dolphins are incredibly social animals and form bonds to forage for food and avoid predators , " she explained			1
those bonds , while they serve the animals greatly in the open ocean they 're accustomed to , can be devastating when the creatures are brought in contact with @entity5 's gently sloping shallows and convoluted estuaries , which are " very foreign to these species			1
" @entity15 said the event , because of its scale and duration , is taking " a huge toll " on the resources of the animal rescue and advocacy group , financially and physically			2
" this is very hard labor			0
these animals can weigh 200 or 300 pounds each , " she said			0
the organization , which gets its funding through donations and grants , has a base operating budget of less than $ 300,000 , and she estimated this event has coast " at least 50 or 60 thousand dollars , " not including staff time			0
@entity0 's @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report .			0

" it 's the largest single - species event " in the @entity47 , a marine mammal expert says
only 37 of 129 dolphins have survived to be released , says @entity18 's @entity15
necropsies have been done on nine animals ; no cause has been determined
some of the released animals have been tracked north of @entity5 , where they belong
