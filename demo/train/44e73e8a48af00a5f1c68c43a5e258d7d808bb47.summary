it claims the proposal has " already jeopardized longstanding efforts to prevent or abolish censorship in totalitarian regimes and protect civil liberties and human rights worldwide			0

restricting people 's access to information online in order to shape their views is as much censorship as the repression of free speech , it said , drawing a comparison with the governments of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0

the government 's plans include tightening the current legal definition of pornography to differentiate between sex and violent or degrading material , she told the newspaper			2
but the activists ' letter argues that " the @entity39 is not the source of violence , it is merely a medium by which violence is made apparent			0
" app stores : gatekeepers , or censors of the mobile web ? if @entity2 's government wants to protect children from learning about sex on the @entity39 , it should focus on improving sex education in homes and schools , it said			1
