@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was a mechanic , not a coal miner , but on the morning of february 19 , 2006 he had to go down into the @entity6 mine near here to fix a broken cart that could n't haul the coal out			1
five years later , @entity3 's remains are still more than 100 meters ( 109 yards ) below the ground , together with dozens of miners who worked that night			1
@entity14 , @entity3 's only son , does n't remember his father			1
he was just 1 year old when " the mine swallowed the miners			1
" so that he wo n't forget , his mother , @entity17 , sets aside part of her widow 's pension -- 2,200 pesos a month -- to buy any newspaper that publishes something about the incident			1
she cuts articles and photos , and pastes them in an album			0
that sunday , just past 2:30 a.m. , an explosion left 65 miners buried who were working inside the @entity30 mine , in the @entity1 state of @entity32 , in northern @entity1			1
the mine is owned by @entity34 , one of the largest mining companies in the country			1
then - president @entity38 never visited the relatives mourning at the mine site			1
president @entity41 has also avoided meeting with the more than 300 family members			0
after five years , the relatives and about five widows continue asking for the bodies to be retrieved from the mine			1
citing dangerous conditions , the company abandoned the attempts to pull them out			0
@entity17 says that a year and a half ago , she stopped receiving the 420 pesos the - ex governor of @entity32 sent so that the children of the miners could continue studying			1
she sells baby clothing to complement her income and keep her son in school			0
she does n't want @entity57 to be a coal miner			2
there are several versions about the cause of the incident that killed the workers			0
@entity34 says that there was an explosion caused by a ball of gas -- gas that escapes from the earth at the moment of the coal extraction -- and that as a consequence , the temperature in the mine rose to more than 900 degrees @entity76 ( 1,652 degrees @entity77 )			1
however , according to the autopsies of the only two bodies that were pulled from the mine , their deaths were caused by asphyxiation , not burns			1
those two bodies were located in the ninth diagonal tunnel in the mine			1
@entity34 says it went nearly 2.8 kilometers ( 1.7 miles ) into the mine , but had n't found the other remains			1
in february 2007 , the @entity32 state government produced 65 death certificates certified by a medical examiner , even though only two bodies had been recovered			1
with 63 bodies still underground , @entity34 decided to suspend the rescue of the bodies in april 2007			1
at that time , the company argued that according to their investigations , 25 % to 75 % of the mine was flooded and " the water possibly is contaminated by @entity99 , tuberculosis , hepatitis , that could contaminate the rescuers , their families and entire populations			1
" these findings were given to the @entity105 , which has advised the victims ' relatives			0
inspection records from a few months before the blast revealed that the ventilation system was failing and that there were problems with the electrical equipment			0
some family members say the workers complained of a strong odor of gas			0
through a spokesman , @entity34 declined to speak about the incident , citing internal policies			1
@entity121 , lawyer for the victims ' relatives in the @entity105 , said that explosions in the regions ' mines had been recorded since 1889			0
even then , the only times that bodies were left inside the mine were 1889 and 2006			1
in the rest of the cases , the bodies were always recovered , alive or dead			2
@entity121 recalled one of the biggest blasts that happened in 1969 in the town of @entity136			0
in the @entity139 mines , more than 160 people died			0
a little over a year later , all the bodies were recovered			2
" the question is n't whether @entity142 could and @entity1 could n't , because the answer that they will give is that it was different because that mine was mineral and this one was coal , and this one had gas and that one did n't			1
what you can compare is the government 's attitude , " she said			2
" neither @entity38 nor @entity41 has wanted to meet the families			2
not only that , but in coal mining region , the bodies are always rescued			1
only at @entity30 they are not			0
" in northeast @entity32 , it 's common to find someone who has a miner in the family			2
walking down the streets of towns like @entity167 , @entity0 , @entity168 and @entity169 , you can see trucks full of freshly mined coal at all hours			2
at the end of each shift -- around 3 p.m. , 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. -- trucks pass by with men whose faces are painted black by the carbon dust that fell on them during their 12 hours of work			0
nearly all the coal in @entity1 is produced in @entity32 , according to the @entity179			2
@entity180 , retired at age 67 , also was a miner			0
he worked for more than 20 years in @entity34 's mines			1
one of his sons remains inside @entity30			0
he and his wife @entity185 have traveled several times to @entity187 to participate in demonstrations in front of @entity34 and the @entity190 to plead for the excavation of their son			1
" we were recently at the @entity195 in november and what i asked for was my son 's rescue			2
i have asked for that since the beginning			0
because the mine is not a cemetery , right ? it 's for people to work in , " he said			1
" what we are asking the company and the government to do is to give the bodies to us , so we can do a holy burial and take him flowers , go see him , go visit him with his daughters , wife , sister , who also have asked for this			2
" @entity180 's son left behind a son and two daughters			2
the widow decided to invest the 750,000 pesos that the family received from the company to set up a used clothes business that she supplies from the @entity223			0
@entity17 , @entity3 's widow , knows the mining life well			2
her father , @entity225 , was also a miner			0
he mined black gold from @entity30			0
he retired several years before the blast			0
five years after the tragedy , she says some rescuers have dared to confess that at night they heard " noises like pickaxes striking on metal			0
" @entity225 thinks those were the sounds of the last surviving miners			0
" though after all that time there is no way that they could come out alive , " he stated			0
for residents like @entity180 and @entity225 , @entity30 turned from a mine into a cemetery the morning of february 19			0
