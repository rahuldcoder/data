the latest report from @entity2 @entity1 on @entity4 targeting of conservative groups - their sixth - says the tax collection agency " systematically targeted " conservative groups over the course of two years and ties the behavior to a " culture of bias " among @entity4 employees			1
@entity14 chairman @entity13 slams @entity4 officials in the report for their " inability to keep politics out of objective decisions " and points to a " general loathing " toward conservative organizations			1
the report -- @entity13 's last before he hands his gavel over to @entity26 rep. @entity25 -- also explicitly spreads the blame beyond @entity28 to seven other top @entity4 officials , singling out two former @entity4 commissioners , the agency 's chief counsel and several others			1
but @entity13 has yet to find a smoking gun linking the @entity4 's inappropriate screenings to political direction from the @entity2			1
that effort will continue under @entity25			0
" the fact - finding is not yet complete , " according to the the report			0
the @entity4 still has yet to comply with three subpoenas requesting more documents and records and under @entity25 's leadership , the @entity14 is expected to look into another 30,000 newly recovered emails to and from @entity28 , the now - former @entity4 official who has been at the center of the probe			1
the @entity47 , which will be chaired by @entity49 @entity48 in january , is also conducting an investigation			0
related : @entity2 says @entity28 emails lost in computer crash @entity53 dismissed the new report as not telling the entire story			2
" it is revealing that the @entity1 -- yet again -- are leaking cherry - picked excerpts of documents to support their preconceived political narrative without allowing @entity62 to even see their conclusions or vote on them first , " said rep. @entity56 in a statement			0
" by leaking information to reporters on condition that they not disclose it to @entity53 , republicans are intentionally bypassing the normal congressional vetting process designed to distinguish fact from fiction			0
" the report released tuesday ties the targeting of conservative groups caused by a " perfect storm of mismanagement " that extended from the bottom rungs of the @entity4 to " the very top " of the organization with " bad judgment , inexperience , and bureaucratic rigidity " at fault			1
but most of all , the report charges that @entity4 staffers inserted their own political beliefs into their jobs , allowing their liberal bias to influence professional decisions on whether groups should obtain tax - exempt status			2
" conservative organizations were not just singled out because of their political beliefs â€” they were targeted by @entity4 officials and employees who expressed a general loathing toward them even while begrudgingly admitting that those organizations were in compliance with ... the tax code , " the report reads			1
the report also reveals emails between @entity4 officials , noting an email from one @entity4 agent to another about an application from a group that had donated to a political group			1
after a first agent wrote that he was " not sure we can deny them " simply for donating to another non-profit social welfare group , another agent replied : " this sounds like a bad org ... this org gives me an icky feeling			0
" reports emerged last year that liberal groups were also singled out by the @entity4 for closer scrutiny , but the @entity14 asserted in its tuesday report that the special attention to liberal groups was for " non-political reasons " and that all seven applications that were flagged for containing the words " progress " or " progressive " were ultimately approved			1
among the senior officials blamed for the targeting or their failure to stop the selective screening of political groups , the committee calls out @entity135 , who led the @entity4 as its commissioner over the course of the alleged targeting			2
the @entity14 asserts that @entity135 was aware of the targeting and failed to do act to stop it			0
" @entity135 failed to fully inform @entity142 about the @entity4 's inappropriate treatment of conservative - oriented tax - exempt applications , despite his awareness of inappropriate treatment , " the committee report states			1
and his deputy and later successor as acting commissioner , @entity149 , also " failed to prevent targeting " and did not " promptly inform @entity142 of the misconduct , " according to the committee			0
both of their chiefs of staff are also singled out			0
the report also slams @entity157 , the director of the @entity4 's @entity159 section , for allowing @entity4 agents to use " inappropriate screening criteria			2
" @entity157 was placed on administrative leave in june 2013			0
the report also suggests that chief counsel @entity164 made a " deliberate attempt to obfuscate his role " in the scandal , saying he could not recall over 80 times in response to the @entity14 's questions .			2

the final report by a congressional committee accuses the @entity4 of having a " culture of bias " against conservatives
the report also claims @entity4 officials had a " general loathing " of conservative groups
the report singles out seven @entity4 officials in addition to @entity28
this is the sixth @entity4 report issued by @entity13 's @entity14
