@entity0 -- a new barter market in @entity0 is helping residents trade their trash for food in an effort to reduce the mountain of waste produced by the mega city			1
@entity0 's huge , infamous @entity11 landfill site was receiving 12,600 tons of waste a day -- one and a quarter times the weight of the @entity15 -- before it was shut down in december last year			1
but although the landfill is is no longer in operation , the city keeps churning out trash			0
that 's why the local government has launched several measures to reduce the waste created by the 20 million people who call the city home			0
the @entity27 began in march this year and has proved an instant hit with residents			1
@entity30 is one of thousands of locals who are now making regular visits to the market held once a month in the city 's @entity35			0
along with his housemates , @entity30 brings along glass , plastic and cardboard waste , which is separated and weighed			1
he is then given vouchers , which can be exchanged at a nearby farmers ' market			1
the vendors at the market hail from local farms , adding the benefit of attracting shoppers to locally produced food			2
for @entity30 , it 's not just about buying vegetables to eat			0
he also picks up baby lettuce plants , which he plans to grow at home and sell at the market when he visits again			0
if he does , it would bring the city 's plan full circle , essentially turning trash into food			2
@entity61 : can @entity62 solve world 's environmental problems ?			0
