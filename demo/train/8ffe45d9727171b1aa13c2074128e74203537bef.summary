@entity0 is a smart guy who knows a heck of a lot about politics and the press			1
@entity5 is also a smart guy who knows a heck of a lot about politics and the press			2
they will now be dispensing their wisdom as paid contributors at @entity12 , and i 'll be interested in what they have to say			2
but i have to ask : is @entity17 's cable channel turning into an @entity19 administration in exile ? it 's hardly a news flash that @entity12 long ago decided to be cable 's liberal bastion , a left - wing counterweight to @entity26			1
but the more the studios are populated with people who worked for the president , the more the network may seem like an off - campus adjunct of the @entity32			0
to be sure , @entity12 was already packed with former @entity34 presidential candidates , from @entity35 to @entity36			2
former party chairman and @entity39 governor @entity37 has also become a fixture , as well as former party spokeswoman @entity41			0
watch : should @entity26 have hired tarnished candidate @entity42 ? but now that the president is into his second term , there is a growing band of alumni available for pundit duty			2
@entity49 went from @entity51 's chief economist to @entity12 talking head			1
now the former senior adviser and former press secretary will be holding forth on their former boss			0
occasionally , the liberals on @entity12 criticize @entity19 from the left			1
the network 's few conservative commentators , such as former @entity62 chairman @entity61 , take aim from the right			0
but is n't that going to be considerably harder for @entity0 and @entity5 , who have devoted their lives to this president ? @entity5 tells me he sees his job " as a political analyst and as someone who has been in the room during important meetings and when big decisions are made who can convey what that 's like to viewers			1
i do n't see it either as being a cheerleader for the president or as a spokesman for the administration 's point of view			1
" watch : @entity86 launches post-affair forgiveness tour " i will be honest with my opinions and when i believe the @entity89 has made a mistake i will say so			0
i 'm sure no one in the @entity89 thought my comments on @entity94 's confirmation hearing were necessarily pro-obama			0
" @entity0 also sees himself taking a different approach : " my role is not that of a surrogate , but an analyst and commentator			2
i 'm proud of my work for and with the president			0
but in this role , i will offer observations , based on my experience over 35 years in journalism and politics , and will call them as i see them			0
" he added : " i 'd also note that @entity17 and @entity12 have , on their roster of analysts , both @entity62 and @entity34			1
" @entity12 did n't invent this practice ; @entity26 is the model			1
for a while , it served as the @entity116 administration in exile , with such loyalists as @entity119 , former @entity121 ambassador @entity120 and ex-press secretary @entity122			1
@entity26 also provided @entity116 with a spokesman when the late @entity124 made the jump from @entity127 ' network to the @entity89			1
the @entity26 payroll was soon packed with potential 2012 contenders like @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , with the latter two jumping from @entity135 's team into the presidential primaries			1
there is no question that the high - profile platform gave them a boost			0
now , @entity42 , who left the race under a cloud after denying allegations of sexual harassment and an extramarital affair , has joined the @entity26 team			2
in his first outing the other night , @entity42 said 51 % of @entity149 were " misled " into voting for @entity19 , prompting a dissent from @entity151			2
is this the kind of unvarnished analysis we can expect from @entity42 ? watch : @entity19 , @entity51 learn pitfalls of @entity157 and @entity158 chat @entity159 is not exempt from this game , having provided a home for @entity162 between his presidential runs and , later , hiring @entity116 41 lieutenants @entity164 and @entity166 , @entity169 alumni @entity167 and @entity170 , and @entity172 's press secretary , @entity171			1
the network also got into the disgraced ex-governor business through its ill - fated fling with @entity176			0
but @entity159 , at least , makes a point of tapping partisans from both sides			0
( @entity182 , for its part , brought in @entity183 from the @entity184 , and he gradually earned credibility in his new profession			0
) when networks employ active partisans such as @entity119 , who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for @entity62 candidates in 2012 and has now launched a new super pac , it 's fair for viewers to wonder whether their commentary is subjugated to an agenda			0
that was the question with @entity195 , who was recently dumped by @entity26 after acknowledging that his predictions of a big @entity198 victory were in part an effort to boost @entity62 morale			0
watch : how did @entity202 get the @entity130 story so wrong ? now that this revolving door is spinning like crazy , are current @entity19 staffers eyeing a television future ? if so , might they be a tad nicer to a future employer ? former @entity210 correspondent @entity209 was a pretty good television guest before joining the administration ; could he follow the well - beaten path to @entity12 ? and what if @entity214 gets bored giving big - money speeches ? maybe @entity0 and @entity5 will surprise me and show an independent streak as members of the commentariat			1
but having labored so long as fierce advocates for @entity19 , that could be a tough transition .			1

@entity0 and @entity5 will become pundits for @entity12
@entity226 : is @entity17 's cable channel turning into an @entity19 administration in exile ?
he says @entity12 did n't start this , @entity26 did when it served as a platform for @entity116 officials
@entity226 : as advocates for @entity19 , it might be tough for @entity0 and @entity5 to show independence
