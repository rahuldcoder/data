-- @entity1 is back -- and she means business			1
the 29 - year - old has not competed since suffering a knee injury in february and looked doubtful to ski again this year after tearing a knee ligament last month			1
@entity6 was airlifted to a hospital in february after landing heavily on the opening day of the @entity9 in @entity10			1
she underwent surgery for knee reconstruction			0
but following training runs on wednesday and thursday at @entity17 's @entity16 course , she is aiming to get back in the groove this weekend ahead of february 's @entity19			1
" you know if your body is ready or not and i know that mine is ready , " she told reporters			0
" normally this is the first downhill of the year , so for me this feels like a normal beginning of the season			0
" @entity6 , who won the @entity31 overall titles in 2008 , 2009 , 2010 and 2012 , is three race victories shy of matching the record of 62 set by @entity10 's @entity34			1
she has won 14 times at @entity16 , including a sweep of all three race titles in each of the past two years			1
the downhill races are scheduled to take place on friday and saturday with the super-g on sunday			0
" my goal yesterday was to ski solid and to ski my race line and i did that , " she added			0
" i knew that if i could accomplish all those things in one run , then i do n't need a second run			0
it 's the smart choice for me to not ski today in order to prepare for tomorrow			0
" @entity16 has always been really good to me and that 's why i really wanted to come back here			2
" with @entity52 on the horizon , @entity6 knows she must avoid any more injuries if she is to defend her @entity56 downhill title in @entity57			1
there she will aim to emulate the feat of fellow @entity60 , @entity61 , who came back the season after reconstructive surgery to win gold at @entity66 in 1998			2
but the @entity60 star has played down her chances of success -- instead focusing on ensuring she copes with her troublesome knee problem must be the priority			1
" i 'm just going to try to make sure things are good with my knee and build confidence every day , " @entity6 added			2
" right now , i 'm just going to focus on this particular moment			0
" @entity52 is quite a ways away			2
i 'm going to just stay focused on my knee and try to get my confidence back			0
