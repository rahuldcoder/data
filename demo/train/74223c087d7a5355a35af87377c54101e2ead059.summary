east of the earthquake epicenter , the long - term future of the metropolis and surrounding area looks uncertain			1
@entity7 has reported from the outskirts of the city on sunday morning describing the shell - shocked population organizing themselves to clear roads , clean up and assist official efforts in searching for missing people , while fearing more aftershocks and tsunamis			2
but even when a semblance of normality returns to the city of around one million people the disaster could compound the problems facing the region ; namely the flight of young people to larger cities and a rapidly ageing population			1
" a trend across @entity29 has been moving out of the rural areas to @entity31 , " says @entity0 correspondent @entity7			0
" the area ( around @entity2 ) has experienced a brain drain and economic drainage ( as young people leave the area )			1
it was already struggling to keep ahead and to keep the local industries going ; agriculture and fishing			2
the last thing that this community needed was for its infrastructure to be wiped out			0
" the tsunami 's destruction : before and after the capital of @entity47 , @entity2 is the largest city in northern @entity29 , less than a two - hour bullet train ride away from @entity31			1
the city lies on the flat , coastal plain between the @entity52 and the @entity53			0
most the eastern suburbs of the city hit by the tsunami are low lying with hills in the city center only around 40 meters ( 140 feet ) high			2
while far from the country 's manufacturing heartland that lies to the south and west of @entity31 , @entity2 is a regional hub with six universities around the city , which have helped develop the region 's technological industries			1
@entity47 prefecture has tried to diversify its industries away from agriculture and fishing to attract and keep a younger and educated workforce			1
the regional government also has been trying to make the area 's traditional industries of farming and fishing more attractive to a younger population , but across @entity29 approximately three fifths of farmers are over 65			1
the destruction of fishing and agriculture infrastructure may compound the difficulties the industries face , although there may be a shorter term boost , says analysts , from the @entity29 government greatly increasing public spending to rebuild			1
for those currently in the city there are more immediate problems of water , food and fuel supplies			0
schools and hospitals in @entity2 have been turned into shelters , and volunteers were handing out bottles of water , @entity0 's @entity7 reported from the city			1
" somehow we can hang in there , " says @entity105 , a native of @entity2 who has been living in @entity106 for 15 years , but in the city caring for her mother			2
" we do n't ' have any water , electricity or gas			0
they 've just announced that it could take days to get gas for everybody			0
we definitely need water and food			0
i do n't think people have enough food or water			0
people prefer to stay in the car as they 're feeling aftershocks			0
