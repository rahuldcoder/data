-- like 20 - or 30 - something singles , older men and women are dating and embracing their sexuality			1
but many older singles -- some of whom have already been down the aisle -- are n't looking to exchange their single status for a band of gold			1
some older americans are looking for companionship rather than marriage			1
" we are not aiming for great changes in the second half of life , but looking for fulfillment in who we are now , " says @entity14 , a @entity15 - based psychiatrist and author of " dating after 50 : negotiating the minefields of @entity24			1
" " not everyone wants another marriage			1
someone might want a companion for going to concerts on saturday night and not much more			2
others might absolutely want -- or not want -- sex as part of another relationship			2
" dating dynamics more than a third of @entity11 over 50 are divorced , widowed , separated or have never married , according to a tally of statistics released in 2006 by the @entity38			1
" many over 50 are no longer looking for that one person , that ' soul mate ' , " says dr. @entity40 , a marriage and family therapist based in @entity43 , @entity44 , who specializes in midlife relationships issues			1
" if you have a life that you like and things you want to do and interests to pursue , maybe you do n't want to sacrifice some of those priorities in order to be someone else 's soul mate			2
" this sentiment does n't just apply to confirmed bachelors , either			0
for many women , their careers and hobbies rank higher on their priority list than do romantic relationships , according to @entity64			0
as @entity67 , a 52 - year - old realtor in @entity68 , @entity69 , a self - proclaimed independent woman who dates but has never been married , puts it simply , " they have to make me happier than i am now on my own			1
" a 2003 @entity73 study of 3,501 singles aged 40 to 69 showed that about one - third of those surveyed were either in a relationship or dating one person exclusively			1
a comparable percentage had dated one or more people in the previous three years			2
but of those who were dating , just 8 percent listed " to find someone to marry " as their reason for doing so			2
indeed , 49 percent said they were simply looking for someone " to talk to and do things with			0
" of course , dating is n't always easy , particularly for those who may be dipping back into the dating pool after years on the sidelines			2
but there are many ways for older @entity11 to meet and get to know one another , many geared specifically to their cohort : online dating and social networking sites , like @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 help seniors find like - minded people with whom they can connect			1
travel programs , such as @entity107 offer learning adventures worldwide			0
volunteer programs , like the @entity108 , connect those with community service programs in need			0
competitive and recreational sports programs , such as @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 , and the @entity117 , target active older adults			1
institutes of higher education , such as the @entity122 's @entity121 or the @entity123 for a @entity124 , offer tuition waivers or discounted classes for seniors			0
sexual evolution or revolution ? just as older @entity11 are n't letting the years stop them from dating , they 're not letting it end their sex lives , either			1
many of the 3,005 @entity11 adults aged 57 to 85 surveyed for a study published in the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) reported having sex at least once within the past year : among the oldest group of sexually active adults , 54 percent were having sex at least twice a month , while 23 percent reported engaging in sex at least once a week			1
the study published august 23 defines sex very loosely to include mutual activity that does n't require intercourse			0
" it is time that our society 's traditional thinking that disconnects old age and sex be revisited , " says @entity146 , author of " @entity147 , @entity148 , and @entity149			0
" " we 're all living longer , so our needs to relate sexually are lasting longer			2
" but older @entity11 who are sexually active face health issues , too			1
although hiv / aids is a threat to @entity11 of all ages , about 19 percent of @entity11 infected with hiv / aids are 50 or older , according to the @entity11 government 's @entity163 ( @entity163 )			1
the @entity163 does n't break down transmission rates among this demographic -- for example , through drug use , heterosexual or homosexual contact -- but the institute does point out that older adults in general tend to know less than younger @entity11 about how @entity159 is transmitted and the necessity of using condoms			1
they are also less likely to be tested for the disease			0
aging can affect sexual performance			0
both men and women may find that it takes longer to become aroused as they grow older , according to the @entity179 ( @entity179 )			2
this may be caused by health problems like heart disease , by medications being taken to treat health conditions , or simply by stress or concerns about a changing appearance as one ages			0
the @entity179 notes that women in the midst of menopause , which causes estrogen levels to decline , may experience pain during intercourse			0
contrary to a commonly held assumption , however , a study by the @entity196 and the @entity197 in 2000 found that lower estrogen levels did not lower a woman 's libido			0
in men , aging can cause impotence			0
about 5 percent of men aged 40 report having this problem , and it increases to about 15 percent of men aged 70 , according to the @entity210			0
