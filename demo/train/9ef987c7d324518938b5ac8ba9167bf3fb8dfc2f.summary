the @entity15 arm of @entity7 frozen food firm @entity16 said it would file a legal complaint monday against the unnamed @entity11 business			1
@entity16 said it had been told that its products were being made with @entity15 beef , not @entity11 horsemeat			1
" we were deceived , " said a @entity16 @entity8 statement			1
" there are two victims in this affair : @entity16 and the consumer			2
" also , the @entity6 arm of @entity16 said saturday said it was considering legal action against suppliers , adding that early results of its internal investigation " strongly suggests " the horsemeat contamination of a beef lasagna product " was not accidental			1
" meanwhile , an emergency meeting was held in @entity0 saturday , as ministers , food inspectors and retailers grappled with a scandal that appears to be spreading across @entity41			1
environment secretary @entity42 said it was " completely unacceptable " that consumers were being sold food that contained horse in place of beef			2
@entity49 found in hamburgers in @entity6 and @entity51 the evidence so far suggests " either criminal activity or gross negligence , " he said			2
@entity42 warned that " more bad news " could come			0
@entity6 food businesses have been ordered to test all processed beef products for " authenticity " and report back to the authorities by friday			1
" i am determined that we get to the bottom of this and that any wrongdoing discovered is punished , " said a statement by @entity42 after the meeting			0
retailers in the @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity7 pulled millions of lasagna and other processed beef products off the shelves as the alarm was raised over the @entity16 lasagnas			1
the controversy comes less than a month after horsemeat was found in hamburgers sold in the @entity6 and @entity51			2
officials in @entity51 have pointed to @entity77 meat ingredients as being the source of horsemeat found in burgers there			0
the @entity82 said the evidence " points to either gross negligence or deliberate contamination in the food chain			1
this is why we have already involved the police , both here and in @entity41			2
" an agency spokesman , @entity92 , told @entity1 that participants in saturday 's meeting had agreed that " meaningful results " must be achieved by friday			1
" this concerns products that are most likely to have been contaminated , such as beef lasagne and other budget ranges , " @entity92 said			0
the meeting was about clarifying what tests are possible , what laboratory capacity is needed , and what can be done to protect consumer confidence , he said			0
horse : coming soon to a meat case near you ? " this is completely unacceptable -- this is n't about food safety but about proper food labeling and confidence in retailers , " prime minister @entity109 said friday , quoted on his official @entity111 feed			0
the revelations have thrown the meat industry into crisis and revolted many meat eaters in the @entity6 , where horsemeat is generally considered taboo , although it is commonly eaten in neighboring @entity8 , as well as countries including @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
@entity16 said thursday it had withdrawn its lasagna -- labeled with the @entity6 spelling , " lasagne " -- from @entity6 stores monday as a precaution after its @entity15 supplier , @entity134 , raised concerns about the type of meat used			1
meanwhile , @entity8 has temporarily withdrawn three ready - prepared dishes -- lasagna bolognese , shepherd 's pie and moussaka -- because of the discovery of horsemeat in purported 100 % beef products , the firm said			1
the company added , however , that the three products could still be eaten without health risk			0
responding to questions as to how long it had known about the horsemeat issue , @entity16 said it had only been alerted by @entity134 in a letter dated 2 february			2
that letter had made @entity16 " aware of a possible august 2012 date " for the contamination , the company said			2
@entity6 retailer @entity156 said it had also withdrawn two of its products , a beef lasagna and spaghetti bolognese , after supplier @entity134 " flagged concerns that the products do not conform to specification			1
" while horsemeat is not itself a food safety hazard , its unauthorized presence -- in quantities up to 100 % -- in foods purported to be made with beef has raised serious concerns			2
@entity134 has not yet responded to @entity1 requests for comment			0
chief among food inspectors ' concerns is that the illicit horsemeat could contain the veterinary drug phenylbutazone , or " bute , " commonly used to treat horses			0
neigh it ai n't so : @entity183 finds horsemeat at @entity41 supplier meat from animals treated with phenylbutazone is not allowed to enter the food chain as it may pose a risk to human health			1
@entity16 has been ordered to test the lasagna withdrawn from shelves in the @entity6 for the drug 's presence			1
@entity156 said in a statement that tests on random samples of its affected products , labeled @entity200 and @entity201 , " demonstrated that the withdrawn products contained between 30 % and 100 % horse meat			0
" this is completely unacceptable and like other affected companies , we feel angry and let down by our supplier			0
if the label says beef , our customers expect it to be beef			0
" samples of the affected @entity16 lasagna also contained between 60 and 100 % horsemeat , according to @entity6 and @entity51 food safety inspectors			1
in january , the @entity216 of @entity51 found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse dna , while 23 of them -- or 85 % -- tested positive for pig dna			0
in nine out of the 10 burger samples , the horse dna was found at very low levels , the inspectors said , but in one sample from @entity228 , @entity6 's largest retailer , the horse meat accounted for about 29 % of the burger			2
@entity228 apologized to customers after the revelation and promised action to make sure it never happened again			0
the discovery of pig dna in beef products is of particular concern to @entity237 , whose dietary laws proscribe the consumption of pig products			1
jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horsemeat			0
the @entity245 confirmed last week that a number of meat pies and similar items supplied to prisons in @entity250 and @entity251 were labeled and served as halal -- prepared in compliance with @entity255 dietary law -- but contained traces of pork dna , the @entity82 said			0
horsemeat is not commonly eaten in the @entity259 , but the country does export it to @entity261 and @entity262			0
