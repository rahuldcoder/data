-- good news : we 're not going to war in @entity4 , at least not right away			0
bad news : we 're headed to a battle inside @entity7 that will pose its own grave threat to the @entity9 and world economy			2
the most conservative republicans in @entity7 are threatening to force default on the nation 's obligations unless the president agrees to defund @entity16			1
less conservative republicans prefer a milder version of the threat : not default , but merely shutting down the government			0
either way , the country plunges into crisis -- a crisis @entity17 must eventually lose , as they have lost every previous round of this same game			2
it 's way past time for @entity17 to find a better way			1
these doomed all - or - nothing battles over @entity16 perversely strengthen president @entity30			1
as @entity17 exhaust themselves in grand debates , @entity16 fastens itself ever more tightly upon the country and the states			1
@entity16 offers large benefits to many @entity9 , and benefits once extended are very difficult to remove			1
that should have been the lesson of 2012 , and unless @entity17 get wiser , it 'll be the repeat lesson of 2016			2
meanwhile , the clock is ticking			0
a core feature of @entity30 's health plan will go into effect in bare weeks -- and all the law 's flaws continue unaddressed			1
the @entity17 challenge is to protect the country from those flaws , by concentrating on the reforms that matter most : 1 ) @entity16 's costs ; 2 ) share @entity52 's burdens more widely			1
@entity9 used to have two health care cost problems : the cost of the health care system to the total economy , and the cost of health care programs to government budgets			1
those two costs were related , but distinct			0
one example : before @entity16 , a proposal to raise the @entity64 qualification age to 67 would have saved the government money , without changing any real economic costs			2
as @entity16 goes into effect , those two costs merge into one			2
raise the @entity64 age to 67 , and @entity64 's costs may fall -- but other program costs will rise			0
an increase in health care costs anywhere will flow directly into an increase in government health care spending			0
if @entity17 want to control the cost of government , they have to change their thinking from " cut government budgets " to " reform health care delivery			1
" to date , @entity9 health care markets have done a poor job of controlling health care costs			1
that has n't been a failure @entity17 worried much about -- but they had better start , because if markets continue to fail , the alternatives will be ever more voracious health care costs or direct government control			1
now problem no. 2 : burden - sharing			0
@entity16 purports to finance itself with taxes only on upper - income @entity9			1
the revenues from these taxes will be inadequate just as a matter of arithmetic			0
worse , this mode of finance corrodes all political incentive for cost control			2
not many voters will deprive themselves of a benefit to save somebody else money			0
if @entity16 is to be part of @entity9 's future -- which is how the betting must run today -- this program that claims to benefit all should be paid for by all , as @entity111 and @entity64 are paid for by all			1
back in 2010 , @entity113 desperate for @entity17 support would happily have accepted a broader tax mechanism			2
today , of course , they have less incentive to deal			0
their voters do well out of @entity16 ; the costs are borne by those @entity9 most likely to vote @entity17			1
but there are revenue measures @entity113 would value even more highly than they value taxes on the affluent : carbon taxes , for example			0
a @entity17 plan to tax work and investment less and to tax carbon more -- and to use such taxes to support health care costs -- would appeal to @entity113 , and would unite both @entity113 and @entity17 in a shared commitment to health care cost control			1
these are real - world political tradeoffs			0
they are less exciting than the grand drama of repeal - or - bust			0
but repeal - or - bust is much more likely to produce a bust than a repeal			0
more productive is the challenge of reforming @entity16 so that the nation can live with its costs -- and so that all equitably shoulder their share of its burdens			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

@entity148 : @entity17 effort to defund @entity30 's health plan is going nowhere
he says it makes more sense to focus on the *key* flaws of @entity16
republicans should push to make sure the plan has cost - control features , he says
he says it makes sense to broaden funding so most @entity9 *pay* for it
