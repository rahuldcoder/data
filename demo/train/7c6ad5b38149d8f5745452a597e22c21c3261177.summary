@entity0 -- two of the world 's largest concrete pumps will depart the @entity6 later this week as part of the effort to resolve the crisis at @entity12 's @entity11 nuclear power plant , officials said			1
each pump weighs 190,000 pounds and has a boom reach of over 227 feet , and can pump water and concrete at massive rates			0
they will be loaded aboard enormous @entity20 cargo jets friday			1
the pumps ' manufacturer , @entity23 , said in a release the devices are normally used to pour concrete for bridges and high - rise construction projects , but can offer pinpoint accuracy " to directly target hotspots within the reactors " and help with cooling			0
there are only three such pumps in the world , said @entity23 spokeswoman @entity36			0
@entity12 prime minister @entity39 issued an emergency order to obtain a similar , smaller pump in march , approximately one week after the march 11 magnitude - 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck @entity12 and damaged the @entity11 plant			1
after the pump arrived and was used to successfully pump 150 tons of seawater into the plant 's nuclear reactor spent - fuel pool , initiatives to bring the two larger devices to @entity12 began			1
just last week , the @entity6 @entity50 was using one of the pumps at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site on the @entity54 in southeastern @entity55			0

the pumps are fully assembled and will remain so during the long journey to @entity12 , @entity36 said			2
" since they 're already assembled , that will mean no delay on the @entity12 end on getting it to the plant , " she said			2
once each machine is loaded on board @entity73 planes , one pump will depart from @entity0 , while the other will depart from @entity75 on saturday morning			1
two @entity23 technicians are traveling with each pump to train the @entity12 who will eventually be operating them , @entity36 said			0
previously , one of the pumps had been used to encase the nuclear reactor at @entity83 with concrete after the 1986 nuclear accident in the @entity86 .			0

the pumps are being loaded friday onto @entity20 cargo jets
