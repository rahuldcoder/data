-- @entity2 marine gen. @entity1 took command sunday of the @entity5 - led @entity4 in @entity6 , where he will oversee the final two years of the war and the withdrawal of nearly all troops			1
" today is not about change , it 's about continuity , " @entity1 said at a change - of - command ceremony in @entity11 attended by his predecessor @entity14 gen. @entity13 and other senior @entity5 and @entity6 officials			1
" i 'll endeavor to continue the momentum of the campaign and support the people of @entity6 as they seize the opportunity for a brighter future			0
" @entity1 replaces @entity13 , whose final days as @entity4 commander were marred by an investigation linked to the scandal that led to the resignation of his predecessor @entity28 as the director of the @entity31			1
@entity13 , who has been nominated as @entity5 's supreme allied commander , was cleared in january of allegations he wrote potentially inappropriate emails to a @entity36 woman who claimed she was being threatened by @entity38 ' mistress @entity37			1
@entity13 oversaw perhaps one of the toughest periods for @entity2 - led @entity5 troops as they battled an ever - evolving insurgency while balancing combat with diplomacy			1
reports routinely emerged of prickly relations between @entity13 and @entity6 president @entity47 , who did not attend the ceremony			1
it not uncommon for a head of state to skip a military handover ceremony			0
meanwhile , @entity6 defense minister @entity53 credited @entity13 for a drop in civilian casualties in @entity6 , saying it helped to restore public confidence in the government			2
until @entity1 's name emerged in august as the nominee for the top job in @entity6 , few people outside of the military community , had heard of him			2
@entity1 has a reputation among @entity14 as a thoughtful , calm leader with more than 22 months under his belt of commanding troops in @entity68			2
the general has no real @entity6 - ground experience			0
but his is not the first @entity4 commander to be in that position			1
before then - army gen. @entity28 took over @entity4 command , he had overseen the war in @entity6 from his perch as chief of @entity77 in the @entity2			1
chief among the issues @entity1 faces is an @entity6 government that has , at times , been critical of @entity5 forces and their actions in @entity6			2
@entity6 security forces , considered the key to the country 's success when troops withdraw by the end of 2014 , still have a long way to go before they are able to handle some operations without the help of the international forces			0
he also faces the issue of @entity6 's ongoing insurgency , including the attacks that continue to be carried out by @entity99 militants and the @entity100			0
but officials close to @entity1 have told @entity0 that the general is not going into the job blind			0
since august , he has been studying the history of @entity6 as well as the military operations since the war began in 2001 , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information			0
@entity0 's @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .			0
