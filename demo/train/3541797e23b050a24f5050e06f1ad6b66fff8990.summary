-- @entity2 president @entity1 will wake up a lame duck monday			1
how lame will depend largely on nationwide midterm elections sunday			2
@entity2 president @entity1 has three years left in his six - year term			1
on the ballot will be 500 federal legislators , six governors and mayors and local legislators in 11 states			1
although @entity1 has three years left in his six - year term and is not on sunday 's ballot , many analysts see the election as a referendum on his performance and his party 's nine - year reign on the presidency			1
by most accounts , @entity1 's party will fare well			1
" he 's going to get a positive vote , " said @entity23 , director of the @entity25 - based @entity24			1
" the nation feels he is doing a better job than they imagined he would			2
" low expectations may be understandable , given the circumstances under which @entity1 came to power			1
after a bitterly fought race that polls indicated was too close to call , the nation went to the polls july 2 , 2006 , to pick a successor to president @entity39			1
the race was so close that the results were not verified until a controversial decision two months later			2
@entity1 's margin of victory was less than 1 percent			1
losing candidate @entity44 refused to accept the results and announced himself the winner			2
fistfights broke out in the lower house , the @entity47			2
the first three years of @entity1 's tenure have not been much smoother			1
perhaps most famously , the president declared war on the drug cartels that have taken hold of @entity2 , spreading corruption , fear and violence to all corners of the nation			1
the war 's outcome remains uncertain , but there 's no doubt about the human cost : about 10,000 people have died in drug violence since @entity1 took office in december 2006			1
the political fallout also has been costly			2
one @entity68 politician said @entity2 was undergoing a civil war			2
a @entity71 report said the nation was in danger of becoming a failed state			2
@entity1 's job got tougher when the bottom fell out of the global economy late last year and the h1n1 flu outbreak drew the world 's attention to @entity2 this year			1
but @entity1 's actions in the face of such adversity have helped his standing , some analysts say			1
" @entity1 has become increasingly popular in the country because he did project a certain amount of strength in the anti-drug war , " @entity23 said			1
" he did stand up to the @entity68 on certain things , like swine flu			2
" @entity1 's aggressive management of the swine flu crisis -- in which he shut down schools , businesses and all public gatherings for more than a week to stop spread of the disease -- has given him higher credibility , said @entity100 , president of the @entity102 policy institute			1
but @entity1 's personal popularity may not help his party in the legislative elections			1
" the question is whether @entity1 has coattails , " said @entity106 , a @entity107 columnist and political talk show host			1
@entity1 is head of the @entity111 , known as @entity111			1
the other two main parties are the leftist @entity113 ( @entity113 ) , which narrowly lost the 2006 presidential election , and the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) , which had a stranglehold on the presidency from 1929 until the 2000			2
@entity111 candidate @entity118 -- @entity1 's predecessor -- broke that hold nine years ago			1
the @entity111 has the most seats in the @entity123 and the @entity47 but does not have a majority in either			2
the party could lose seats after sunday , as most polls show the @entity115 holding a slight lead			1
" we will see the resurgence of the @entity115 , " said @entity129 , a @entity130 national security adviser for president @entity131 in the late 1970s			1
the @entity113 , he said , has largely discredited itself through internal division			2
" and the @entity111 has been overseeing a government that has shunted from one crisis to another , " @entity129 said			0
still , some observers say @entity115 inroads may not make much difference			0
" it will not change the balance of power much in @entity2 , " said @entity141 , director of the @entity143 's @entity142			0
" @entity1 will still have to negotiate with one of the two opposition parties to get legislation passed			1
" @entity100 said , " it 's not going to be as critical election as everyone was predicting			0
" but as @entity1 moves into the last half of his presidency and other politicians start jockeying to succeed him , he probably will find it increasingly difficult to get his legislative agenda accomplished			1
" @entity1 will have a small window of opportunity to get in additional reforms , " @entity106 said			1
" and all of this is happening amidst a terrible economic crisis , a terrible security crisis			0
" and then there 's the issue of what many see as increasing voter distaste for the electoral process			1
" there 's a general disenchantment about the @entity111 administration for the past nine years , " said @entity169 , a professor at the @entity170			1
" they 're linked to the economic crisis , the health crisis , the security crisis			0
" but the @entity115 , he said , does n't offer much of a choice			0
" the problem here is that the @entity115 is not a new @entity115 , " @entity169 said			0
" they 're not necessarily going to imply much change or difference			0
" nor is the @entity115 united , @entity106 said			0
" everybody assumes that the @entity115 gets along			0
that 's not true , " @entity106 said , noting that the party is riven with " fractionalism			1
" most voters will just stay home			0
election officials predict a 30 percent turnout			0
others will annul their vote : they will turn in blank ballots , so officials will see that they voted but not for anyone			1
" there 's a lack of hope of making a difference with a vote , " @entity169 said			2
perhaps no one will be more interested in the results than the drug cartels			0
numerous news reports have detailed how narcotraffickers fund some candidates , intimidate others to stay out of races and bribe politicians after they have been elected			0
" the narcos definitely have taken this as another way in which they can expand their power , " @entity169 said			0
federal authorities have arrested more than 100 local officials in recent weeks on accusations that they have been taking money from drug cartels			0
the " narco - politicians " included mayors and a judge			0
@entity225 , the former mayor of a town in @entity228 state , told a major newspaper two years ago how he had to go see the local drug boss when he decided to run			2
after he won , @entity225 said , he was constantly pressured to appoint officials the drug gangs wanted			0
" if you do n't do it , they kill you , and that 's that , " @entity225 was quoted as telling the @entity238 newspaper			0
" all candidates have to suit them , whether they belong to the @entity115 , the @entity111 or the @entity113			0
the drug gangs give their approval to candidates			0
" @entity225 apparently fell out of favor			0
a group of armed men killed him in november			0
more recently , armed men opened fire last week in @entity249 state on a @entity111 candidate for the lower house			0
he escaped , but two aides were killed			0
after all this , how the election and vote - counting is carried out sunday looms as a major worry			2
no one wants to see a repeat of 2006			0
" this is a referendum on democracy , " @entity169 said			0
" [ @entity2 ] may be convinced on democracy			0
the question is whether they 're convinced that voting will lead to anything			0

president is not on ballot , but many see vote as comment on his performance
party is expected to do well despite years of troubles
@entity1 has stood strong in face of adversity , analysts say
many see increasing voter distaste with electoral process
