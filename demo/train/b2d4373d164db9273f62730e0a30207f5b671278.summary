-- since @entity2 was acquitted in the death of @entity4 , everyone has had an opinion about the verdict			1
i am not about to second - guess the jury 's decision or pass judgment on them			0
our judicial system is operating as it was designed			0
the jurors reached their conclusion based on the evidence placed before them and their interpretation of the law as it was explained			0
as human beings , we see the world through the lens of our own experiences			0
both science and history prove that we all have unconscious biases that impact the decisions we make			1
there are some who say that the @entity31 case had nothing to do with race			1
there are others who say that the case was all about race			1
one idea that has come up : " what if we reverse the races so that @entity4 was white and @entity2 was black ? " that exercise , while potent , does n't prove or disprove the relevance race played in the case			1
a more powerful approach is to totally remove race as a factor by creating a scenario in which both the perpetrator and the victim are of the same race and then see whether people change their views			2
for example : " what if @entity4 and @entity2 were both white ? or both black ? " if @entity2 and @entity4 were both white , ask yourself : would it have taken 44 days and a national protest to merely justify the arrest of a known killer ? a killer who shot an unarmed child , initially stalked that child , was charged with two previous felonies -- " battery of law enforcement officer " and " resisting officer with violence " -- was accused of domestic violence ( both charges were reduced , though some would say that 's the benefit of @entity2 having a father who is a retired judge ) and disobeyed the authorities when told not to follow the person he eventually killed			1
would authorities have not drug tested the killer but instead drug tested the victim ? would hordes of people have donated money to help the killer hire a strong defense team that eventually got him acquitted ? would society have given so much credibility to the killer 's version of the events ? many have tried to deflect the discomfort of this scenario by focusing on black - on - black crime			2
while such crime is a very serious issue that must be addressed by our society and especially the black community , turning to black - on - black crime is a form of avoidance			0
the uncomfortable truth is that very likely , most people would see the case differently if the killer and victim were both white			1
when will we reach a day when we do n't have to refer to crimes in racial terms ? in light of how much we know about ourselves on a scientific level , it is a shame that people are still so divided by race			1
in 2003 , the mapping of the human genome code proved that there are no significant genetic differences between what we call " races			0
" every human being on the planet is 99.9 % genetically identical to every other human being			0
but as societies , we live in constructs			0
for those who fear the average random black male wearing a hoodie , i can empathize with you			0
but statistically , you should be more afraid of the person you see every day in the mirror			2
according to the @entity134 , suicide is one of the top causes of death for white @entity138 ( @entity139 )			2
so , your chance of killing yourself is greater than your chance of being killed by anyone , of any race			0
let 's turn back to the question : " if the victim and the killer were both white , would society have given so much credibility to the killer 's version of events ? " i doubt that a jury so heavily made up of white mothers would have related to or felt empathy toward a man who had stalked and killed an unarmed child who could have very easily been one of their own			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			1

@entity164 asks , what if @entity4 and @entity2 were both white ?
@entity168 : the uncomfortable truth is that most people would see the case very differently
he says we all have unconscious biases that impact the decisions we make
@entity168 : when will we reach a day when we do n't have to refer to crimes in racial terms ?
