-- four grand slam finals , four heartbreaking defeats			2
@entity3 was in danger of becoming the " nearly man " of men 's tennis -- and despite his public brave face , it was taking its toll			1
" physically we go through a lot , " the 25 - year - old told @entity0 ahead of next week 's @entity12			1
" so sometimes i questioned whether it was worth it because i had lost a lot of close matches and had n't quite got to where i wanted to get to			0
" july 's defeat at @entity20 , his home grand slam , was hard to take			0
tears flowed after the final as he addressed the crowd			0
but just four weeks later , his revenge victory over longtime nemesis @entity29 on the famous grass courts earned him the gold medal at the @entity32 -- and in september @entity3 became the first @entity34 male player to win a major since @entity36 in 1936 when he lifted the @entity37			1
@entity3 crashes out in @entity38 as @entity12 finals line - up is completed his older brother and occasional doubles partner @entity41 says that @entity45 final was the defining moment in @entity3 's career			1
" i guess maybe it closed some of the doubts , i guess maybe in himself , but especially in the rest of the tennis world and in the media , " he told @entity0			0
" he 's finally got a grand slam now and hopefully that 'll be the start of many to come			0
" @entity59 , tennis correspondent for the @entity60 , has followed @entity3 's career from the start and knew only too well the self - imposed pressure and self doubt that plagued the @entity65 , who has now won nearly $ 24 million in prize money on the @entity67			1
" i can only pay tribute to his dedication to keep going , this is a tremendous affirmation of his qualities			0
it means everything to him , " @entity59 told @entity0			0
@entity3 's @entity75 success against a man who had beaten him in three grand slam finals , and his later silver medal alongside @entity79 in the mixed doubles , was made sweeter by his overwhelming support from a patriotic , flag waving home crowd			1
" i 'd probably say the @entity32 was a highlight -- not just the match but the whole two weeks of the @entity32 were just unbelievable , " he said			2
" i love sport , so as a sports fan it was great to be part of that and i love watching all the other sports whilst the tennis was on and then to win a gold medal and then a silver in the mixed was great			0
i really , really enjoyed it			0
" the man credited with helping @entity3 take the final step from nearly man to big - time winner is coach @entity100 , appointed at the turn of this year with just that in mind			1
@entity59 said it had been a " brave move " as former world no. 1 @entity100 had little formal coaching , but " the proof of the pudding is in the results			2
" in what may prove to be a good omen for @entity3 , @entity110 - born legend @entity100 lost his first four grand slam finals before going on to win eight			1
" i 'm not saying i will go on to achieve anything like that but he always wanted to keep improving , " @entity3 said			1
" he worked incredibly hard			0
he would really do anything in terms of his training and his practice			0
" that 's what i will look to tap into over the next couple of years , how to , after reaching a certain goal , how to reset your goals and how to keep getting better			0
" @entity3 will be seeking to emulate one of his best friends on the tour , @entity128 -- who will be the year - end world no. 1 for the second season in a row no matter what happens in @entity134 at the eight - man season finale			1
the @entity136 was effusive in his praise of @entity3 , who he first played at the age of 11 , following his final defeat at @entity141			2
" it is obviously nice to hear that from him , he made his big real breakthrough last year -- he had one of the best years ever on the tour so he has helped inspire me in a way to keep trying to get better and believing that you can get to the top , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 's heroics earned him a rapturous welcome in his hometown of @entity153 , scene of a 1996 mass shooting at the primary school which he attended			2
a lone gunman , @entity157 , killed 17 people before taking his own life			0
@entity3 , eight at the time , survived by hiding in a classroom			2
he has revealed since that his mother @entity161 once gave @entity157 a lift in their car while he was sat in the back			0
a stunned community united in their grief and shock but now revel in the achievements of @entity3 and his brother , who has won a mixed doubles title at @entity20			1
" i think @entity153 's only maybe 9,000 people and it 's very close - knit , especially after the bad experiences that have happened in the town in the past , " @entity41 said			0
" i think for what @entity3 's done the last few years of his career has really put a more positive light on the town and everyone 's so behind him			2
" the pair have enjoyed success as a doubles partnership , claiming two @entity67 titles , but losing in the first round of this year 's @entity32 competition			1
@entity41 has always relished the experience			0
" to be able to play high - level sport with your brother is always a cool thing to do , it 's pretty unique as well			1
" it 's a standing joke between them that @entity41 is the only one to claim a @entity20 title -- he won with @entity197 in 2007 -- but with @entity3 desperate to add to his grand slam tally it 's perhaps only a matter of time before that changes .			1
