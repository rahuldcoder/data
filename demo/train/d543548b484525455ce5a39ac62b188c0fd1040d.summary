@entity0 -- @entity2 says there are 14 million reasons why @entity5 is wrong			1
in an intraparty feud about political strategy , the @entity7 minority leader on tuesday called out the no. 3 @entity10 for saying that it was a mistake for @entity13 to focus on passing health care reform in 2010			1
" after passing the stimulus , @entity13 should have continued to propose middle class - oriented programs and built on the partial success of the stimulus , but unfortunately @entity13 blew the opportunity the @entity25 people gave them , " @entity5 said in a remarks focused on political messaging heading into 2016 at the @entity17			1
@entity26 's @entity5 added , " we took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem -- health care reform			1
" when asked whether she agreed with @entity5 's assessment , @entity33 's @entity2 did n't mince words in a written statement provided to @entity1			1
" we come here to do a job , not keep a job			0
there are more than 14 million reasons why that 's wrong , " @entity2 said			2
the 14 million figure @entity2 cites references those @entity25 who now have health care coverage since the law was enacted			2
it adds together those who have signed up through health care exchanges , those allowed to say on their parent 's health care plans through age 26 and those getting coverage through the expansion of the @entity55 program			0
@entity2 's office also maintained that the @entity57 has had a positive economic effect in terms of bending the cost curve over the long term			0
they also took issue with the notion that the @entity7 , under @entity2 's speakership , was n't focused on the economy after @entity67 was elected			1
an aide noted that the @entity7 passed a jobs bill the @entity13 - led @entity70 did not take up , and the original version of the stimulus bill the @entity7 passed was larger than the final version the @entity70 approved			0
later tuesday , an @entity7 official also weighed in			0
as did a couple of former @entity7 officials			0
an aide to @entity5 said the @entity26 @entity78 has hinted at this concern in the past			2
@entity5 supported the @entity57 , but from a political timing standpoint , he thought the party could have done other things before turning to health care			2
but in moving to stake out the party 's message going forward , @entity5 put himself at odds with @entity2 , who was one of the fiercest champions of passing the legislation through the @entity7 in 2010			1
the controversial bill passed without a single @entity93 vote , and the @entity7 @entity93 filed a lawsuit last week to challenge president @entity67 's authority to make changes to the law			0
@entity1 's @entity98 contributed to this report			0
