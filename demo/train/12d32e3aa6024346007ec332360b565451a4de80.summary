-- @entity1 holds a unique place in @entity4 's culture			1
it was a bit of an afterthought , originating in 1910 -- some 40 years after @entity7 -- after a woman in @entity9 , @entity10 , campaigned that dads needed to be honored , too , she was right			1
we could n't possibly ignore @entity13			2
we love him , too			2
he deserves more than second billing			2
still , we all know @entity15 gets the most attention			2
she gets the perfume , she gets the flowers , she gets the candy , the new dress , the heart - felt cards and even breakfast in bed , ( maybe )			2
it 's @entity13 who takes the kids and goes searching with them for @entity7 presents			1
but @entity13 ? well , he gets a tie			0
or maybe some t - shirts , golf balls , cologne , or a lounging shirt			0
a few joke greeting cards			0
@entity15 reminds the kids , and hands them a little money to shop with , saying , " get him something he 'll enjoy			1
" yeah , it will be a tie			0
or , if he 's lucky , his young ones may do a handmade gift			0
that ceramic cup that leans just slightly to the left			0
our public portrayal of fathers has shifted during my life			1
tv fathers have " evolved ' from real people like sheriff @entity55 , @entity58 's dad @entity56 and @entity59 " @entity60 , to cartoon dads like @entity62 , and @entity66 's caricatures in " @entity13 ! " and " @entity64			1
" none of the latter are exactly the firm , wise , wisdom - dispensing fathers of the " back - in - the - day " tv dads			1
but my dad was the real deal			1
and he never allowed his nine kids to forget			1
today 's fathers are having a rough go being kindly portrayed in the media			1
thank @entity78 , we do we have president @entity80 for a national model			0
he both dotes on and takes a firm loving hand to our first - family daughters			0
and every once in a while , he gets to parent a " son			0
" i recall his having a sort of father - son talk with a crying boy who 'd lost an egg at the @entity95 easter egg roll , telling him -- like a father -- to " shake it off			1
" i also recall the president saying on tv , with @entity100 sitting right beside him , ( foolish man ) that he put more thought into his gifts , than he got back -- producing a very frosty look from the first lady			0
but , it was probably true			0
it was in my family			0
there are , of course , instances of bad fathers , men who were n't up to the job			1
those who abandoned their kids , or were often drunk			1
those who were present with necessities , yet absent from their children 's lives			1
@entity78 bless them for missing out on the most rewarding parts of being a male , and @entity78 bless their kids for surviving and maturing in spite of this			1
president @entity80 knows about this -- he was raised largely without his father -- as does @entity128 , whose father died three months before the 42nd president was born			1
it 's true you never know the full depth of a parent 's touch in your life until they 're gone			0
even if you cared for them in their old age , there 's never a way to prepare yourself for the death of a parent			0
if you 're a girl , you 're always @entity132			0
you 're vulnerable , no matter how worldly , or sophisticated , or strong you 'd become along the way			0
my dad , @entity146 , let me know how proud he was , even as he kept me from being too big for my britches			1
my father would have celebrated his 83rd birthday this weekend			1
it 's been two years since his death , but i think of him every day			1
@entity146 loved sports , he enjoyed cooking and loved his family			0
and most of all , he devoted most of his life to trying to help others			0
on this @entity1 , i think of my @entity13 , my grandfathers , uncles and my two brothers who are good dads to their kids			1
i also think of all the fathers whose sons were taken in service to this nation			2
@entity146 would approve of that			0
i think of the fathers of the boys and girls killed in @entity170 , and 74 school shootings since then			2
i think of all the fathers who 've lost daughters and sons to illnesses , or accidents -- far too often a father 's only child			1
i also think of the fathers whose sons turned mass murderers , despite every effort to parent a son who 'd make a good citizen			2
there ca n't be a worse hell on earth than that			0
then , i turn my prayers and attention back to the fathers still parenting			2
i think and pray for the fathers across the nation who are raising @entity4 's next generation , and of those still advising the current , grown up , generations			2
there 's no more important job in the world than raising a child , even when you 're the president			0
there 's no more important job than being a father			2
@entity1 to all the dads , granddads and soon - to - be - fathers			1
join us on @entity213 / @entity212 .			0

@entity215 salutes her father and all the real fathers who were there for their kids
@entity1 was afterthought , but now first in her mind as she remembers her dad
