@entity0 -- more than 2 million people have signed up so far for health coverage under @entity5 , officials said tuesday in trying to put the best face forward before the controversial health care reforms fully kick in with the start of 2014			1
the enrollment figure represented a big increase after the botched launch of the system in october , but health secretary @entity13 was unable to say how many of the 2.1 million who enrolled have paid their first premium to ensure their policies take effect on wednesday			1
@entity13 and other officials also acknowledged the possibility of more potential problems , warning people to bring proof of coverage with them to their doctor or pharmacy , pay premiums when due and double - check with insurers that they are covered			0
@entity33 : starting the new year in @entity5 limbo under the reforms , @entity35 will be required to have health coverage or face a fine			1
@entity13 called the full implementation of reforms under the @entity41 a new era in health insurance , noting they mean no denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions or other discriminatory practices such as charging women more than men			0
" starting tomorrow , being a woman will no longer be a pre-existing condition , " @entity13 said on a conference call with journalists			0
the @entity5 enrollment figure is below the target of 3 million originally set by the administration for the end of december , which is halfway through an initial six - month sign - up period under the law intended to help millions of previously uninsured @entity35 get coverage			1

@entity13 said tuesday that another 3.9 million people were eligible for coverage through expanded @entity66 and @entity72 , but she was unable to specify how many have become new enrollees			0
the botched rollout of the new marketplaces on october 1 , when the @entity77 website set up to handle the enrollment failed to work properly , damaged the sign - up process until the system began working better in early december			2
@entity13 said the administration was " doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period " for people getting new coverage			2
anticipating possible problems in the enrollment system , @entity13 also advised in her blog post that " if you thought you enrolled in health coverage but are n't showing up in the system , call your insurance company directly			2

asked if the website woes in october and november could be due to attacks from outside by @entity5 opponents , a spokeswoman for the @entity98 told reporters there were technological problems but no sign of hacking			1
the health care reforms championed by president @entity108 have become the defining issue of his presidency , with @entity111 led by tea party conservatives trying to dismantle them while some democrats appearing leery of campaigning on them in the november congressional elections			0
while the @entity117 ruled the mandate to obtain health coverage was constitutional , further legal challenges are being mounted			2
also on tuesday , a group of @entity122 organizations , in an emergency appeal , asked the @entity117 to delay the @entity5 requirement that certain religious - affiliated groups provide contraception and " abortion - inducing drug " coverage to their workers			1
