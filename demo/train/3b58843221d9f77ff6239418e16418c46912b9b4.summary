-- video producer 's note : lasers are now being used to help people with disabilities communicate			0
@entity0 got a firsthand look at how this assistive technology works when @entity8 , executive director of @entity9 , gave us a demonstration of the @entity13 keyboard at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
in the above video you 'll see how the technology has given a voice to people that would otherwise have no means of communicating on computers and smartphones			2
in what other ways do you think lasers can be used to help people with disabilities ?			0

the @entity13 keyboard for the disabled can be *accessed* by laser control
@entity8 : when it comes to *jobs* and *school* , assistive technology can level the playing field
the keyboard is *designed* to limit head *movement*
