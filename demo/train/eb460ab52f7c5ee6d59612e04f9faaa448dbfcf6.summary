@entity0 -- a @entity0 judge released @entity3 from house arrest friday , after prosecutors presented evidence questioning the credibility of the hotel maid who accused the former @entity10 chief of sexual assault			1
the alleged victim , a 32 - year - old immigrant from @entity21 , admitted to prosecutors that she lied about the specifics of her whereabouts following the incident , the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms , according to documents filed in court friday by prosecutors			1
but while the case has taken a dramatic turn , it has not been dismissed , said @entity29			2
the indictment and charges -- including criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse -- against @entity3 , 62 , still stand , @entity29 said			2
his lawyers said the alleged victim told " substantial lies about her own background and the facts of this case			1
" defense attorney @entity40 commended @entity29 for doing what he said was appropriate			0
" we believed from the beginning that this case was not what it appeared to be , " he said			0
" we are absolutely convinced that while today is a first giant step in the right direction , the next step will lead to a complete dismissal of the charges			0
" @entity3 's release significantly eases the extraordinary bail conditions that had been previously ordered			1
the @entity53 financier had been released from jail on $ 6 million bail but was under house arrest in a luxury townhouse in @entity60 's @entity59 neighborhood			0
he was paying roughly $ 250,000 a month for court - ordered 24 - hour armed guards posted at the townhouse			0
the presiding judge said authorities will continue to withhold @entity3 's passport but that he is free to travel in the @entity67			1
the stunning twist in the case came after prosecutors , in the course of their investigation , discovered that the alleged victim had not been truthful in a variety of topics regarding her history and circumstances , prosecutors said in a letter submitted to the court			1
prosecutors said the woman admitted lying in her application for asylum in the @entity67 and that she had been a victim of a gang rape , providing details of that attack			2
she cried when she first told prosecutors about the rape but in a subsequent interview , she admitted the gang rape never occurred			2
she said the fabricated account on the asylum application was made with the assistance of a man who " provided her with a cassette recording of the facts " so that she could memorize them			0
the woman told prosecutors that she has declared the child of a friend as her own dependent on her tax return in order to receive a larger refund			2
she " also admitted to misrepresenting her income in order to maintain her present housing , " the prosecutors said			0
after the alleged hotel assault , the woman told prosecutors that she " fled to an area of the main hallway of the hotel 's 28th floor and waited there until she observed the defendant leave , " the prosecutors said			1
she said she then reported the incident to her supervisor			0
but in subsequent interviews , the woman admitted her testimony before the @entity124 was false ; that she " proceeded to clean a nearby room , and then returned to suite 2806 ( the room occupied by @entity3 ) and began to clean the suite before she reported the incident to her supervisor			2
" in angry remarks delivered outside the courthouse , the woman 's attorney , @entity130 , admitted problems with his client 's credibility , but the bottom line , he said was that she was attacked			1
" that was true the day it happened and it is true today , " he said , describing in chilling detail the account the woman gave of her attack and the bruising on her body			0
" she has described that sexual assault many times to the prosecutors and to me			0
and she has never once changed a single thing about that account			0
" the development is particularly stunning given prior statements by @entity0 authorities , who spoke forcefully about the accuser 's credibility , and it leaves the felony case against @entity3 teetering on collapse , despite incontrovertible dna evidence of sexual contact recovered from the hotel suite			1
" it 's just an extraordinary , extraordinary development considering this case was brought with such great fanfare by the @entity60 district attorney and they very loudly trumpeted the credibility of the accuser , " said @entity162 , @entity1 's senior legal analyst			1
" what makes it even more extraordinary is that the ( @entity159 ) evidence apparently shows a sexual encounter between @entity3 and the woman who is the maid			1
yet even with dna evidence , the prosecution is considering dropping the case			1
that shows how bad her credibility may be			0
" @entity130 , her attorney , said allegations about the woman 's involvement in drugs , published in the @entity187 , are a lie , adding that @entity189 was afraid of losing the high - profile case			2
@entity130 also said one of @entity29 's top aides is married to an individual connected @entity3 's defense team , creating an untenable conflict of interest in the case			1
@entity29 told reporters friday that @entity3 's release did not dismiss the indictment or any of the charges against the former @entity10 chief , though he did not address @entity130 's accusations of impropriety			1
the implications of the case are far reaching , especially in @entity53 , where before his arrest , @entity3 was considered a viable candidate in @entity53 's presidential election			1
the turnaround in the case comes just ahead of the july 13 filing deadline for the @entity53 presidential primaries			0
if the case collapses , @entity3 theoretically has enough time to file			1
his supporters would still like to see him run , though some @entity214 interviewed on the streets friday said even if @entity3 was cleared of wrongdoing , it was too late for him to seek office this go - around			2
still , many in @entity53 felt vindicated over concerns that @entity0 prosecutors were perhaps over zealous and that there had been a rush to judgment			0
they were shocked by widely broadcast footage of @entity3 in handcuffs in may , since a @entity53 law passed in 2000 prohibits the publication of images of suspects in handcuffs or in court in order to protect defendants ' presumption of innocence			2
@entity237 , @entity53 's former minister of culture and education , said he was very happy about the latest developments -- and hoped to see his fellow @entity241 politician make a comeback			0
" if the prosecutor and the court decide to declare the innocence of @entity3 , it will be a good day -- a good day for @entity3 himself , a good day for @entity67 justice , a good day for @entity53 and a good day for the @entity249 , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity250 in @entity0 and @entity251 and @entity252 in @entity253 contributed to this report .			0

the case has changed dramatically but has not been dismissed
@entity3 's release came after his accuser 's credibility was *doubted*
prosecutors disclosed that the alleged victim told them she lied about several matters
despite dna evidence , prosecutors now have doubts about the case
