curbing @entity1 's appetite for wild game is just the beginning of the war against illegal poaching , say conservationists			1
last week , the @entity7 of the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) clarified the country 's laws on the illegal wildlife trade			1
anyone who eats endangered species , or buys them for other purposes , is punishable by up to 10 years in jail , state - run news agency @entity12 reported			1
@entity17 , a spokesperson for the @entity18 who is based in @entity20 , told @entity21 she is " very happy " that the announcement comes with a long list of protected species			2
" the law has always been there , but the interpretation has cleared up the ambiguity			0
now it is clear that consumers have to bear responsibility			2
but we still have to watch if they will actually enforce and execute on the legislation , " she said			0
@entity1 has 420 animals on a list of officially protected endangered species			1
it includes the giant panda and golden monkey			0
many species on the list are illegally traded for their meat , organs or body fluids , considered delicacies and prized for their supposed medicinal properties			2
@entity51 to @entity1 , the endangered pangolin can be found on restaurant menus selling for as much as rmb 2,000 ( $ 324 ) a dish			1
the cuora trifasciata , more commonly known as " golden coin turtle , " is traditionally used in making a medicinal jelly			0
nowadays , both wild and farmed turtles are very expensive and less commonly used in mass - marketed medicinal turtle jellies			0
the high cost involved in feasting on endangered species means the meals are a status symbol			1
now , those hungry for a taste of the wild will have to think twice before taking a bite			0

" then @entity1 decided to destroy confiscated ivory and @entity20 will follow next month			1
so i do see a trend of stepping up efforts to protect species in the region			2
" @entity20 will burn 28 tonnes of seized ivory on may 15 , the largest stockpile to ever be destroyed			0
but @entity105 points out that consumers and retailers on the black market are only one part of the puzzle			2
" we need to see a lot of effort from many different angles in order to protect endangered species and recover the dwindling populations			1
" population decline can be due to threats to their habitat through urban encroachment , conflicts with agricultural producers , climate change , as well as poaching , " says the activist .			0
