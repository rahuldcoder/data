-- the second day of @entity1 delivered a shock in the day 's feature race , the @entity4			1
some of those in the crowd at the @entity8 course had come to see the @entity9 , arriving , as she does every day of the @entity10 , by horse - drawn carriage from @entity12			0
others had come to see the horse regarded by many as the queen of the turf : reigning @entity19 champion @entity18			1
the @entity21 filly would be the first @entity23 winner to run at the @entity10 since 1989 winner @entity24 finished last in the following year 's @entity25			2
racing in the colors of @entity29 's @entity28 operation and ridden by @entity30 , who got off to a flying start on the first day of the meeting , if she had looked carefully , @entity18 would have been greeted by a friendly face on her first trip outside @entity21			1
located in the grounds of @entity1 , nestled among the champagne bars , is a statue of her sire @entity39 , formally owned by the @entity9 herself			1
it was in the face of these omens and no small measure of hype that the racehorse of the year for 2013 ( an honor she shared with @entity49 ) took her place in the high - class field of eight			2
the 8/13 hot favorite was aiming to become just the seventh filly to win this race			0
and indeed , a filly did add her name to the record books			0
it just was n't treve			0
racing in the colors of music impresario @entity63 , it was @entity64 , whose career has been characterized by stunning highs as well as heart - breaking lows , who decided to re-write the script			1
@entity64 traveled brilliantly under regular jockey @entity72 , streaking clear in the home straight to land the race in a course record time			1
in second was @entity77 under @entity78 , with @entity18 crossing the line in third			1
the top three were all inside the old course record			2
" she 's an absolute star , " @entity72 told reporters after the race			1
" she proved today what she can do against top class horses			1
" her owner described it as the biggest win of his racing career			0
but there was concern in the @entity92 that the sparkle she showed when capturing the @entity23 by five lengths was mysteriously absent			0
" she did n't feel like @entity18 , " conceded @entity30			1
" her action on the way to the start was short and choppy and i knew in the back of my mind that i was in trouble			0
" her trainer , @entity103 , concurred : " her action was not right			0
maybe we 'll find something wrong			0
let 's take her home to @entity111 tomorrow and see how she is -- and do n't forget the winner today is a good filly , too			2
" the @entity9 herself enjoyed a day of mixed fortunes			0
in the opening race , her horse musical comedy could only finish 18th after taking a keen hold early on			0
the race was won by @entity120 for trainer @entity121			0
in the @entity123 , the day 's major handicap , a fast finishing @entity122 managed a creditable 4th behind @entity124			2
her filly estimate -- heroine of last year 's @entity1 -- will attempt to defend her @entity129 title on thursday .			1
