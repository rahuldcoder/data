-- on wednesday , president @entity1 took a meaningful step toward reshaping our nuclear arsenal in line with the reality of 21st - century security priorities			1
standing at the @entity8 in @entity9 , he announced that he would seek negotiated cuts with @entity11 of up to one - third of strategic nuclear weapons as well as address the issue of nuclear weapons stationed in @entity15			1
but we must understand that these proposed reductions are significant only if they are part of an ongoing effort to eliminate nuclear weapons altogether			1
if they serve to legitimize the indefinite retention of nuclear weapons at an " acceptable " level , the specter of nuclear catastrophe will continue to haunt humanity , for arsenals of this reduced size would still inflict unimaginable destruction across the planet			1
a study by @entity30 ( @entity31 ) showed that if only 300 warheads in the @entity11 arsenal got through to targets in @entity37 cities , 75 million to 100 million people would be killed in the first 30 minutes by the explosions and firestorms that would destroy all of our major metropolitan areas , and vast areas would be blanketed with radioactive fallout			1
in addition , the entire economic infrastructure , on which we depend to sustain our population , would be destroyed			0
the transportation system , the communications network , the public health and banking systems , the food distribution network -- all would be gone			0
in the months after this war , it is probable that the vast majority of the @entity37 population who were not killed in the initial attack would die of starvation , exposure , epidemic disease and radiation poisoning			2
even with @entity1 's proposed reductions in nuclear weapons , the @entity37 and @entity11 would each continue to possess more than triple the nuclear weapons required to cause that devastating scenario but as unimaginable as these direct consequences would be , the effects throughout the world would be even worse			1
a recent study by @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 ( @entity31 ) showed that a nuclear war , even with the reduced numbers @entity1 has proposed , would cause catastrophic global climate disruption ( @entity31 )			1
the firestorms started by these nuclear explosions would loft 50 million to 100 million tons of soot into the upper atmosphere , blocking out the sun. in a matter of days , temperatures around the world would plummet by as much as 20 degrees centigrade -- 36 degrees @entity84 -- in the agricultural regions in the interior of continents			1
the result would be a catastrophic failure of crops throughout the world and a global famine that could claim a majority of the human population			0
the existential threat to human civilization that nuclear weapons would still pose does not mean these proposed reductions are not useful			2
on the contrary , they are a critically important step to reduce the nuclear danger , and it is essential that we implement them as rapidly as possible			0
but we ca n't stop there			0
this effort must lead to multilateral negotiations involving all nuclear weapons states , negotiations that will produce a nuclear weapons convention banning these weapons once and for all			2
these negotiations will not be easy , and the treaty they produce will have to be a hard - nosed agreement that establishes mechanisms to verify and enforce compliance			0
but we do n't have an alternative			0
some say it is unrealistic to think we can eliminate nuclear weapons			2
but in truth , it is unrealistic to think we can maintain nuclear arsenals indefinitely and still avoid a nuclear conflict			1
the @entity126 51 years ago brought us to the brink of nuclear catastrophe			0
further , we know of at least five occasions since 1979 when either @entity130 or @entity131 prepared to launch a nuclear war in the mistaken belief that they were themselves under attack			2
the most recent near miss that we know about was in january 1995 , a full five years after the fall of the @entity139			0
on each of these occasions we were incredibly luck and a national security strategy based on luck is not a wise course of action			0
as long as there are arsenals of nuclear weapons , we are living on borrowed time			1
we owe it to our children to eliminate them from the world , and we should start by implementing the modest proposals made by @entity1 in @entity9 this week			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 and @entity70 .			0

president @entity1 will seek cuts with @entity11 of up to one - third of nuclear weapons
**writers** : no such thing as " acceptable " level ; even *lesser* amount could obliterate humanity
**writers** : 300 warheads would kill 100 million ; the rest would die from starvation , poisoning
we can not maintain nuclear arsenals indefinitely and still avoid a nuclear war , they say
