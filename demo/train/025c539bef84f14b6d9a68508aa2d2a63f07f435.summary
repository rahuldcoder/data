-- what does freedom mean for @entity3 ? if you asked @entity6 , a @entity7 , or a @entity9 member of @entity10 what freedom means , each would likely have a ready answer : @entity13 is individual autonomy and it is closely identified with the market			1
but with @entity3 , most @entity16 simply would not know his answer			0
in fact , the @entity19 's leadership for decades now has been unable to articulate how its goals and policies ( like universal health care ) actually connect to personal liberty			1
this is no doubt partly to blame for last week 's election results			1
in @entity16 today , the language of freedom has been ceded almost entirely to the political right			1
unless @entity19 can offer a compelling counter-narrative , they will remain on the defensive whenever they depict government as a tool for social and economic change			2
part of what makes the conservative language of freedom so politically potent is that it resonates with a problem many @entity16 face			1
in the 21st century we are faced with increasingly massive and hierarchical institutions			0
we have big business and big government , both run by a small number of highly trained professionals			2
individuals feel powerless , without meaningful voice in key institutions and subject to decisions made elsewhere -- mostly behind closed doors			0
the conservative response has been simple			0
it has been to blame government for the problem of bureaucratic growth and hierarchy			2
tea partiers hope to reverse the sense of disempowerment by dismantling state programs and deregulating the economy			2
they say they envision the marketplace as a site for free exchange by equals , in which commercial self - regulation enhances individual entrepreneurship			2
some liberals find it difficult to understand why this vision resonates with so many of their fellow @entity16 , given that it ignores the pathologies of corporate power			2
what they might note , though , is that even if this conservative response is incomplete , it at least articulates the lack of control many people experience and presents freedom as a product of individual self - rule			2
for precisely this reason , conservatives have been able to harness populist sentiment and to cast liberals as out of touch elites			0
@entity7 talk invoking the importance of " @entity90 " emphasizes how it seems to them that professionals -- not ordinary @entity16 -- are often in political charge and how liberals seem indifferent to the scale and remoteness of modern bureaucracy			1
rather than yield the language of liberty to the right , the @entity19 needs to provide a clear response -- if for no other reason than that the conservative approach is both backward looking , which is not helpful , and excludes many			1
given the dominance of finance capital , the idea of the unfettered marketplace as a site for individual empowerment is largely wishful thinking			0
even worse , in the hands of conservatives , that marketplace is also a space for zero - sum competition , in which many are left on the outside looking in			0
some @entity7 , for instance , have made this circumscribed liberty even more limited by saying that only " true " @entity16 should benefit from its blessings			1
under this view , freedom requires restrictive policies toward immigrants and other groups that they fear threaten economic prosperity or national security			0
for them , liberty is no longer a universal ideal to be practiced -- rather than just preached -- by @entity16			0
instead , liberty is a privilege of the few , one that goes hand in hand with exclusion			0
in the past , social constituencies -- such as those organized by the agrarian populists in the late 19th century , the labor movement and the civil rights movement -- articulated how freedom and inclusion could be bound together			0
for someone like the rev. @entity146 , liberty meant providing individuals with practical power over both corporate and state entities			1
but public action had a key role to play			0
if @entity19 hope to persuade @entity16 of the value of government programs , they must engage with the pervasive sense of disempowerment mined so fruitfully by conservatives			1
they need to explain why the root cause is ultimately corporate authority , not state responses			1
they also must clearly explain how securing liberty rests on exerting democratic control over mammoth private companies -- by employing government to reduce the size of banks , to roll back corporate privileges and to ensure that the public has a greater say in the most important decisions			1
today those social movements that articulated this vision of freedom are largely demobilized and it rests primarily with the @entity19 leadership to carry on their aspirations			0
the question is whether @entity3 and those around him still believe in these values , let alone are willing to defend them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 says @entity9 , @entity7 , @entity6 clear on defining freedom : free markets , autonomy
dems very bad at explaining how goals , like health *reform* , connect to personal liberty
he says right 's language ties populism to corporate freedoms not really in their *interest*
@entity185 : dems must explain link between liberty and corporate *oversight* , government programs
