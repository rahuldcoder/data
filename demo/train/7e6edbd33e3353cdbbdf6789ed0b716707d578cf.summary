@entity0 , @entity1 -- this weekend marks the end of an era for many fans of the iconic @entity6			1
the @entity0 museum dedicated to preserving the glitz , the glamour and even the gaudiness that defined the entertainer 's career is closing sunday after more than 30 years			1
despite his dynamic history , the draw of the @entity14 has been eclipsed by some of @entity0 ' increasingly lavish attractions			1
low attendance is the primary factor in the decision to close the museum , @entity20 president @entity19 said			1
@entity25 himself opened the museum in 1979 , and in its prime , it brought in 450,000 visitors a year			1
" we 've dwindled down to 50,000 , " @entity19 said			0
he blames the low attendance on the museum 's location three miles off @entity34 , commonly known as the @entity35			1
" we are just geographically not desirable , " he said			0
[ when the museum opened in 1979 ] we were n't competition for the @entity35			1
we actually complemented the @entity35			0
" @entity19 feels that the megaresort style of the new casinos of @entity0 -- with high - end shopping , an abundance of restaurants , shows and other museum - type attractions -- gives tourists everything they could need			1
" it 's kind of like going to @entity48 or @entity50 resort			2
you go there , and you do n't really have to go anywhere else			0
" if there is a bright side , it 's that since the closing was announced weeks ago , attendance has nearly tripled , according to one tour guide 's estimate			1
a significant number of this influx are locals who 've lived in @entity0 for decades but never made it to the museum			1
but positive attendance news in the 11th hour does n't change the fact that for most of the 23 employees , not only will they be out of a job , they 'll be out of a way to educate people on a man they 've come to admire			2
" i mean , [ @entity6 ] was @entity0 , " museum director @entity74 said			1
" @entity76 everything and seeing everything ... you start to believe in what a nice man he was , and you really wanted everyone to know that			0
" museum archivist and historian @entity84 has been the go - to gal for anything and everything @entity6			2
" he 's made such an impact on my life ; it 's unbelievable			2
i get kind of choked up talking about him , " she said			0
she could tell you about all sorts of things , from " @entity102 " @entity25 's early life as a piano prodigy to his prime years as the highest - paid entertainer in the world , with the highest flamboyance factor to boot			1
he was a man who , in the midst of a battle with @entity106 , sold out @entity108 's @entity107 so fast that his record still stands			2
@entity84 's very first experience with mr. showmanship himself was a night that almost did n't happen			2
" i really did n't want to go , " she recalls of the show her husband roped her into attending			0
but that evening sparked a passion , some might say obsession , for the king of bling			0
up until his death in 1987 at 67 , she attended no fewer than 50 of his shows			0
" all you need to do is go to one performance , and you want to go to every one after that			0
he just captivates you with his charm and his music			0
" after the museum closes sunday , @entity84 will continue to work for the @entity20 part - time			1
but there will be no more camera - wielding visitors oohing and aahing over @entity6 's rhinestone - studded piano , complete with matching costume and @entity134			2
see an ireporter 's snapshots of the glitzy museum the musician 's remarkable costumes became more elaborate as the decades went on , some taking more than a year to construct			1
throughout his career , he played eight major hotels in @entity0 , with his longest run at the @entity145			1
in addition to establishing the museum in @entity0 , @entity6 set up a foundation to provide scholarship money to students of the arts			1
to date , the foundation has given more than $ 6 million to more than 2,700 students			0
but what it 's able to offer these days has diminished significantly			2
two years ago , the scholarship fund amounted to $ 112,000			0
the following year , that number dropped to $ 62,000			2
@entity19 said people can rest assured that the museum 's collection -- which includes more than 60 of @entity6 's intricate eye - popping costumes , his 9 - foot mirrored @entity165 grand piano and his 7 - foot rhinestone studded @entity165 grand -- wo n't go into hiding for too long			1
a traveling tour of part of the collection is planned			1
the tour might be under way as early as summer 2011 , according to @entity173 , chairman of the @entity20 board of directors			0
a new incarnation of the museum is n't out of the question			0
" the board felt it best to close while we are still solvent and create a new business plan as we examine ways to sell our current location and search for locations that would allow for more patrons , " @entity173 said in an e-mail			0
tour guide @entity187 said he was n't terribly surprised that the museum in its current form wo n't be around forever , but he agrees that @entity6 is too much a part of @entity192 to be totally forgotten			1
" @entity0 has a history of tearing down and not preserving			2
it 's a sad commentary , but that 's what this town is about , reinventing itself , " @entity187 said			0
" i would n't be surprised if somewhere down the line , @entity6 gets reinvented again			0
by whom and how , i do n't know			0
but it is sad to see it close			0
