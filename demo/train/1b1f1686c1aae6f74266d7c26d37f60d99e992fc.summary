-- it 's been 15 years since @entity2 and @entity3 fell in love after that pivotal poetry reading in @entity6 , but fans of " @entity8 " are still talking about the pair 's epic romance			1
a highbrow , dramatic love story between two young african - americans , " @entity8 " grossed a mere $ 12 million at the domestic box office in 1997 , but it has an enduring cult following that can certainly be attributed to the film 's authenticity			1
one month after " @entity8 ' " 15th anniversary , however , " @entity18 " earned more than $ 39 million domestically in its first week			1
featuring a predominantly @entity25 ensemble cast , the film adaptation of @entity23 's best - selling nonfiction book , raises a frequent question : is @entity27 finally ready to support more movies featuring @entity25 - @entity25 love ? the creators behind these stories have hoped the answer to that question would be " yes " " a million times " before , said " @entity36 " writer / director @entity34			1
" maybe ( ' @entity18 ' ) is the spark			1
" filmmakers say @entity27 executives , often citing humble box office numbers , can be skeptical when it comes to pouring money into @entity25 productions			0
@entity46 's 2000 movie , for example , is still a fan favorite but earned just $ 27 million domestically in theaters			1
@entity49 and @entity50 , who wrote the screenplay for " @entity18 , " say it 's difficult to get financing for a black film			1
the film only had $ 12.5 million to play with , but given its box office success thus far , the men hope bigger budgets will increasingly be available to films featuring actors of color			1
with the exception of @entity64 's character , @entity63 , who was written as an @entity25 , @entity49 and @entity50 said , they " did n't know what color the whole thing was going to be going in			0
" their main concern , @entity50 said , was exploring the universal differences between men and women			0
the pair said they have an interracial couple they wanted in the film and their race " is never commented on , " but the couple 's problems stem from the fact that he refuses to grow up and be a man			2
" @entity25 filmmakers , we know the audience is there , " " @entity36 's " @entity46 said			0
" it 's just , the films that are made are not always as great as they can be , so when one fails , they think , ' the @entity25 - @entity25 audience is n't going , ' as opposed to , ' it was n't a very good movie			0
' " " @entity8 " writer / director @entity93 adds that when one action movie fails at the box office , nobody assumes it 's because people are n't interested in seeing action movies			1
but that 's been the case with romantic dramas			0
" there 's a dearth of love stories in general , " said @entity93 , who 's currently working on a " @entity8 " sequel			1
" you do n't see a lot of romantic dramas from @entity27 of any kind			0
... by the time that concept trickles down to black people , there 's nothing really			2
" most of the movies starring @entity25 casts that do feature a love story are meant to be comedic and aimed at a very specific audience , @entity46 said			0
( even " @entity18 , " which rests on its love stories , is very much a comedy			2
) and although @entity124 's films routinely attract moviegoers , studios seem to view his movies as a separate genre , she continued			0
" i would love to just obliterate this idea of black film being a genre , " she said			1
" it should n't be a genre			0
there should just be films with @entity25 casts			0
" " @entity18 " might have attracted a more mainstream audience because of the way it was marketed			2
there were advertisements for the film all over the place , @entity46 said			0
it appeared to target a much wider demographic than films like " @entity36 " and " @entity8 , " she added			2
whether the flick will continue to draw crowds in its second weekend at the box office remains to be seen , but its performance to date might be enough to warrant more films of its kind -- and quite possibly a sequel , as one of the film 's stars , @entity154 , recently suggested			1
when a movie like " @entity18 " comes out , audiences flock to theaters , @entity46 said			2
" there 's a huge audience out there , starved for content			0

after " @entity8 ' " 15th anniversary , " @entity18 " earns $ 39 million
the film 's earnings more than *doubled* its $ 12.5 million budget
*screenwriters* say it 's hard to get financing for a black film
