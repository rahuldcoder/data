-- @entity1 should be soaking in the last vestiges of her teenage years			1
for her , that would mean bringing out the vert ramp after school and skateboarding until dark			0
these days , the only thing she 's boarding is another flight to @entity11			2
this @entity13 season , the 17 - year - old model is being dogged by phrases like " it girl " and " one to watch " that are being tossed around by industry insiders			1
this week , she 's across the pond in @entity21 walking for @entity22 and @entity23 and will soon be off to @entity13 events in @entity25			1
these appearances come on the tail of spring ad campaigns for high fashion houses @entity29 and @entity31			1
" every job that i get , i feel so honored , " she said			0
" because yes , there are so , so many models that would die to be in my position on that set , doing that shoot			2
" but the @entity39 - born teen was n't always so keen on the idea of modeling , despite her mother 's urging that she had something rare , that elusive @entity45			2
" i was such a skater , tomboy girl that i was like , ' that will never be me , ' " she said			2
" i was definitely anti-girly girl , makeup , fashion , all that			1
" less than two years ago , fate stepped in wearing stilettos : @entity52 was scouted in her home state by the @entity55			1
shortly after , a representative from the @entity57 , now her agency in @entity60 , came out to scout her for a bigger market			1
last summer , @entity52 was flown out to @entity60 to try her hand at @entity13			1
but , as the end of the week approached , she had n't booked a single job			2
" it was like , ' ok , i do n't know anymore , nothing is really working out , ' " she said			0
then , she got the call for the @entity70 " exclusive " -- meaning she would open the show			1
it 's the fashion equivalent of a high school baseball player getting the call from the @entity75			1
fast - forward five months , and the laid - back skater girl says that modeling , however unlikely , is her focal point			2
( though she does , admittedly , get antsy after a while getting her hair , makeup and nails done and redone for each show			0
) " people think we stand in front of a camera for 30 seconds and that 's our day , " she said			0
" in actuality , we work really , really hard , and a lot of the money we earn , we earn it			0
" for her , that means shape - shifting from 17 - year - old tomboy to high fashion archetype			2
@entity1 , who describes her natural hair color as a " dirty blonde , auburn mix , " first dyed her mane a shocking " @entity105 " red for the @entity70 spring 2014 ad campaign , which also just happens to feature controversial star du jour @entity104			1
" i think it 's cool			0
it 's perfect to be able to stand out , " she said			0
with her neon tresses , @entity1 walked in shows for @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity70 during this month 's @entity113			1
" a lot of ( designers ) were surprised			0
a lot of them did n't like it , but i did n't really care , " she said			0
" when it comes to certain shows , obviously , this color would n't match the clothing , and it would n't look good , so i understand getting canceled for shows or not getting picked for shows			0
" that tinge of teenage rebellion is working for @entity52 , who is in high demand			2
her breakout success comes at a pivotal time , as @entity60 legislature passed a bill in november that deems models under 18 , like @entity52 , child performers			1
among the stipulations : models must obtain a permit to work in the state , employers must also be certified to employ the young models , and child performers must get 12 hours of rest between jobs			1
still , @entity52 is growing up fast in the high - stakes fashion world			1
" you drop off the teenager side of you and just go full - force into modeling and make it into a career and pursue it for a while , " she said			0
it 's a work ethos she credits to being raised by older parents , who still live in @entity39 : her mother had her when she was 43			0
" my teenage years were like when i was 10 , " she joked			0
" it helps me in this industry , because you have to act mature , take responsibility for yourself , because no one else will			0
" see all of @entity165 's @entity113 coverage .			0

@entity1 , 17 , is being called fashion 's new " it girl " model and " one to watch "
@entity52 is walking in @entity172 this week ; she walked in @entity60 as well
@entity60 legislature now *classifies* models under 18 as child performers
