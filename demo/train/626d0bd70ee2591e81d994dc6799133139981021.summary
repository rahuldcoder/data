@entity0 -- nearly 30 years ago , @entity2 was the target of a gang initiation			1
she had pulled off the highway in @entity6 , to buy something at a convenience store , when a car pulled up alongside hers			2
she noticed two 12 - year - olds struggling with something in the back seat			2
suddenly , they were pointing a gun at her			2
" i saw their faces , and they were terrified , " she said			2
then the shot rang out			2
the bullet only grazed @entity2 , leaving a scar near her nose , but the incident changed the way she thought about gang violence			1
she said she later learned from police that the children were told they had to kill someone that night or someone in their family would suffer violent consequences			2
" i was n't the victim that night , i was the collateral damage , " said @entity2 , now 50			1
" the victims were the two babies in the back seat holding the gun			2
it turned my view upside down about who the victims are			2
sometimes , it 's the person pulling the trigger			1
" more than two decades later , @entity2 was living in @entity0 when she once again had a brush with street violence			1
driving home from her job as an executive at a health - care company , she found her street blocked by police tape			1
someone her daughter knew had been killed -- the unintended victim of a drive - by shooting			2
for @entity2 , that was the turning point			1
" it was just too much , " she said			0
" too many young men were lying face down in their own blood			0
i did n't want it to be normal anymore			0
i did n't want the children to think that this was normal			0
i had to do something			0
" @entity2 quit her job , downsized her life and created the @entity63			1
since 2010 , more than 460 children and young adults have come to the center to spend their free time and escape the violence on the streets			1
" we offer a space out of the path of the bullet , where a young man can put 6 inches of cinder block between him and violence outside , " @entity2 said			1
more on @entity1 : @entity0 looks to shake @entity77 title @entity63 , which stands for @entity78 , includes fun activities such as basketball , video games and pool			1
but it also provides mentoring , tutoring and job training so that young people can set themselves on a path to a brighter future			1
" we 're empowering our young men and women to ... find out what they might want to do , " @entity2 said			1
" we work on finding our passion			0
" @entity63 draws young people from across the city , and the tensions that exist between different neighborhood factions can occasionally flare up			0
@entity2 's ultimate goal is to teach them to work through those moments without resorting to violence			1
" statistics say that overwhelmingly , the young men being murdered on the street , they know their murderer , " she said			0
" if you go get your people , and i go get my people , all we 're doing is perpetuating the cycle			0
... so our point here is to stop			0
" " our motto is ' reconciliation , never retaliation , ' and that 's a hard lesson in an eye - for - an - eye world , " she said			1
" what we do is ( ask ) ... ' how can we address this differently ? what could we do to de-escalate this situation instead of escalate the situation ? ' i constantly ask questions			0
... the young men come up with the answers			0
" sometimes , they 'll use words to calm a given situation			0
other times , they 'll have " dance - offs " or use other artistic endeavors			0
whatever the method , @entity2 knows that every situation that 's negotiated peacefully gives young people tools they can use in the future			1
" i wish i could tell you that i could get them to change their ways , ( but ) it does n't work that way , " she said			0
" we give them the space and the opportunity to make that decision			0
what i have found is that no one has ever really given them the opportunity to make the choice			0
" when i ask them why they hang out with ( me ) every friday night , they say , ' because you 're the first person who ever let us in the door			1
' that is an indictment on our society			0
" @entity2 is motivated , in part , by her religious beliefs			1
she serves as an associate pastor at a local methodist church			0
but she said she does n't force her religion on the children , and evangelizing is not allowed at @entity63			0
" many of the kids ask me , ' why are you here ? ' and i 'm honest with them , " she said			1
" i 'm here because it 's the right thing to do , and i feel like it 's what i 'm meant to do , and that has a lot to do with my faith			2
" this is a nondenominational center , but what i bring in is universal			2
it 's about leading a nonviolent life			2
" when you look at @entity2 -- a 50 - year - old white woman -- you might not think she 'd have much in common with the mostly @entity182 males that come to her center			1
but the reality is quite different			0
@entity186 , a 20 - something young man at @entity63 , said he felt an " instant connection " with @entity2 after hearing her past			1
soon after , he was showing her his own bullet wounds and telling his story			0
" i 've kind of gone through a similar situation , " he said			0
" i 've hung with the wrong crowd and did wrong things , and we all know when it 's enough , right ? " @entity196 , 20 , says the direction of his life was changed by @entity2 's message			1
" i 'm not even going to lie to you : i was on the verge of getting ready to seriously hurt somebody , " he said			0
" me and my friends actually had weapons			0
but miss @entity2 , she stopped us			1
" miss @entity2 taught me how to deal with my anger ; she taught me how to be in control of myself , ( not ) let others influence you			1
" today , @entity196 helps others at @entity63 , where he sees young people facing the same struggles that he once did			0
" i think to myself , ' that 's exactly where i used to be , ' " he said			2
" so i mentor them , i act as a role model to them			0
the little kids who come up to me , they hug me and they say they love me			2
it brings tears to my eyes at the end of the day , and it makes me happy to know that i 'm actually influencing their lives			0
" the way miss @entity2 influenced me is the same way i feel like i 'm influencing them			1
" this peer - to - peer mentoring , and the fact that the majority of the young people that come to @entity63 are referred by their friends , confirms to @entity2 that she 's on the right track			1
while she 's still in the process of assembling measurable data , she said she sees evidence of her impact every day			2
" i 've seen increases in @entity245 , kids are getting jobs , recidivism has gone down , " she said , noting that the one statistic she is most proud of is that almost all of the young people she 's helped are still alive four years later			1
" the successes of @entity63 are not necessarily going to @entity248 or getting out of the neighborhood			0
( it 's ) when a kid like @entity196 can live ( here ) and make a conscious choice every day to not be involved in the violence , spread the message of nonviolence , and work hard to get other kids to put down the gun			1
" @entity2 and her family have had to make sacrifices to keep @entity63 open , trading a five - bedroom house for a two - bedroom apartment			1
at one point , things got so tough that a woman bought @entity2 groceries with her own food stamps			1
but @entity2 said she would n't have it any other way			1
" at the end of the day , my house and my cars , that was sticks and bricks , steels and wheels , " she said			0
" the kids , they give up everything to be here			2
i ca n't do anything else but be here			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity63 website at @entity287 and see how to help .			0
