@entity0 -- with her glossy dark hair , exotic outfit and ruby - red pouting lips , she 's every inch the classic pin - up ... except , that is , for that greenish - blue skin			1
and yet her image was every bit as popular , in its day , as those of the latest @entity13 starlets			0
she is the " @entity14 , " by @entity15 , the @entity17 - born @entity16 who became king of the kitsch portrait			1
in the 1950s and ' 60s , no self - respecting suburban home was fit to be seen without a print of her on the living room wall			1
at one point , the picture was reputed to be the most reproduced image in the world ; on wednesday , the original sold for almost $ 1.5 million ( Â £ 982,050 ) at @entity30 auction house in @entity0 , far outstripping pre-sale estimates of $ 750,000			1
speaking to @entity1 before the auction , @entity32 , director of @entity33 @entity30 said that the picture 's kitschy popular appeal " is n't necessarily a bad thing			1
" " it is an extraordinary image ... and it certainly seems to have caught everyone 's eye			2
it is , i suppose , the ' @entity45 ' of kitsch , but it is a great work of art as well			2
" @entity15 's biographer , @entity48 , says the picture was " one of the most important pop culture icons " of the mid- 20th century ; @entity32 agrees , " the word iconic is so often - used and almost debased now , but this really is an iconic image			1
" the painter himself wrote that " my heart and soul went into this painting , " and whatever the secret , it was certainly a success			2
" millions of people -- perhaps your parents or grandparents -- bought a lithograph of the painting , hung it on their wall and admired it for years , if not decades , " wrote @entity48			0
" maybe you even grew up looking at it			0
" while cheap copies of the picture flooded the globe , the original disappeared from view : taken to the @entity73 by @entity15 for a hugely successful tour in the 1950s , it was bought by a young fan , and hung in the family home , a world away from the art scene 's latest fads and fashions			1
the identity of the model for " @entity14 " was a mystery for decades , too			2
after she was eventually identified three years ago , @entity1 visited @entity85 at home in @entity87			0
now in her 70s , she explained how , as a teenager , she came to pose for the painting			0
" my uncle had a laundry and i worked in the office			0
@entity15 used to pop in there every second week or so			2
he said to me , ' hello ... i 'm @entity15 ... i would like to paint you , would you like to sit for me ? " but she said that although her image went on to feature in the homes of thousands of people around the world , modeling for the picture -- for which she was paid about $ 10 -- did little to change her life , much of which was spent in poverty during the apartheid era			1
" he was n't famous			0
people hardly knew him , " she said , adding that she was no fan of the finished work : " ugh , green face ... why is my face green ? " cabaret artist @entity110 , whose entire stage show is based on the " @entity113 " of @entity15 's painting , said it was a " dream come true " to come face - to - face with her muse in @entity0 this week , ahead of the sale			1
" she 's been a constant in my life for so many years , but i did n't think i would ever get to see her in person , " she told @entity1			0
" when i was doing my research , i read that she was lost , possibly even destroyed			0
" @entity32 said the first version of " @entity14 " was indeed believed to have been ruined -- possibly by one of his enemies on the @entity128 , a world which disapproved of his decision to sell paintings through department stores , rather than galleries			2
" @entity15 had a lot of antagonism towards him ... and just before he set off to the @entity73 , a lot of his paintings were slashed			2
one of them was the ' @entity140 girl			0
' " he repainted a new version of it , and this is ... the famous version , the one from which all the prints were made , and the one everyone knows			0
the first one , no - one even knows what it looked like			0
" several other , lesser - known @entity15 pieces , including " @entity151 " and " lady with @entity153 " are also set to go under the hammer in the sale			1
there has been a massive renewal of interest in the artist 's work since a major retrospective of his work at the @entity164 two years ago -- the first time " @entity14 " had been seen in public since its sale some 60 years before			1
" prior to that , he was perhaps regarded as a bit of a joke , " @entity32 said , but the show " brought him back into the mainstream " and meant he could take his place alongside other international artists			0
" art is so subjective , " he explained			0
" some people love it , some people loathe it , but that would be the same of any work of art , be it a @entity185 , a @entity186 or a @entity15			1
" whether the artist deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as the long - time stars of the art world is a matter of personal taste , but the sale of " @entity14 " appears to have cemented his reputation as a commercial , if not critical , success .			1
