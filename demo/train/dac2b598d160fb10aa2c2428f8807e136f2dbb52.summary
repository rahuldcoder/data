-- @entity2 president @entity1 declared a state of national calamity as the death toll from @entity6 , the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the @entity2 this year , continued to climb			1
at least 540 people have died since the typhoon , known locally as " @entity11 , " hit tuesday , the @entity2 ' emergency management agency said sunday , while nearly 1,100 are reported injured			1
another 827 people have been reported missing , the @entity12 said			1
@entity1 's declaration of a state of national calamity will allow local governments to access funds for rescue , relief and rehabilitation efforts in their areas , the official @entity14 said			1
the declaration will also help national and international aid reach stricken communities , and will mean price controls are imposed on basic goods , the news agency said			2
the @entity30 said it will assist in relief operations , with an emphasis on reaching communities isolated by infrastructure damage			2
among the worst hit areas was the poor , remote @entity37 region on the southern @entity2 island of @entity39 , where thousands of flimsy houses have been ripped to shreds			0
scores of people died , many them swept away in flash floods that roared down from the hills			1
the epicenter of the devastation appears to have been in @entity48 , a town about 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) southeast of @entity49 and close to the steep mountains			0
the flash floods hit it head - on tuesday , washing away families huddled in their homes and soldiers stationed in a compound in the town			0
on friday , @entity1 visited the area , as well as @entity59 , in @entity60 , to see the destruction for himself , the @entity14 said			1
he ordered government agencies to speed up relief efforts and the reconstruction of roads and bridges to help much needed supplies and assistance reach the affected areas			1
" i have @entity39 on my mind , especially the number of people missing			2
i am hoping these people will be found safe and sound , " @entity1 was quoted as saying ahead of the visit			1
the president said he was saddened that some families would spend the holidays in evacuation centers because their homes were destroyed			2
rescuers struggle to aid @entity2 storm victims large parts of @entity48 and many of the people who lived there are now buried under mud , fallen trees and rubble , said @entity88 , an emergency response program manager for @entity90 , a humanitarian group			2
" the mood is really gloomy , " he said thursday after visiting the town , where 90 % to 95 % of the houses are believed to have been destroyed or damaged			0
residents who evaded death now lack food , shelter and , most of all , drinking water , since the nearest source is 5 kilometers away , according to @entity102			1
" they are just trying to survive , " he said , noting that the knee - deep mud in many places made it difficult to get around , with several areas of the town completely inaccessible			0
@entity6 raked across @entity39 and several other @entity2 islands before moving off into the @entity109			1
the powerful typhoon brought savage winds that uprooted entire banana plantations in low - lying areas , and relentless rain that unleashed torrents of rocks and mud down the mountainsides where shanty - dwelling miners dig for gold			0
preemptive action was taken in northern @entity39 , expected to feel the full force of the typhoon , but in the end it was the less prepared communities of @entity37 and @entity60 , further south and east , that bore the brunt			0
many people either did n't hear warnings or did n't heed them , expecting the typhoon to hit further north , as usually happens			0
the disaster has left about a quarter of a million homeless and affected more than 5 million people overall , the @entity12 said friday			0
