-- @entity1 , the man who stood on top of the tennis world after winning his ninth @entity5 title last weekend , was brought back to earth with a bump thursday			1
the world @entity8 , so dominant on the clay at @entity5 , was beaten in the first round of the @entity13 grass - court event in @entity14 , @entity15 , by a player ranked 84 places below him			1
@entity15 @entity18 required less than an hour to win 6 - 4 6 - 1 on the grass to send @entity1 crashing out of the tournament			1
the @entity25 , playing his first match on grass since he was stunned in the opening game of last year 's @entity24 , appeared to struggle with the transition			1
at @entity24 12 months ago , @entity1 was beaten by @entity28 @entity27 who was ranked 100 at the time in a five - set thriller			1
and any hopes he would be given the chance to warmup for a return to @entity33 were given short shrift by home favorite @entity18			2
@entity18 had only ever beaten one top - 10 player , @entity36 , and this result ranks as his best yet			1
@entity1 was n't the only star to falter thursday -- @entity39 , who is set to start the defense of his @entity24 title later this month , was beaten at @entity42 in @entity43			1
@entity39 was beaten by veteran @entity28 @entity44 7 - 6 6 - 2 in his second match since appointing former women 's no. 1 @entity46 as his new coach			1
the 27 - year - old , who won the @entity51 title in 2009 , 2011 and 2013 , had won his past 19 matches on grass			0
" i have only got myself to blame that i lost the first set , " the @entity54 told the @entity13 website			2
" i do n't know how many set points i had , but quite a lot of them were on my serve			0
" on this surface especially you should n't really be losing sets like that			2
for me , that 's what 's disappointing really about the match			0
then , unfortunately , got broken in the first game of the second set			0
i could n't quite get it back			0
" the 35 - year - old @entity44 's reward is a quarterfinal clash with @entity73 @entity72			1
meanwhile , seven - time @entity24 champion @entity74 survived a scare in @entity14 before booking his place in the quarterfinals with a 6 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 2 win over @entity79			0
the @entity81 ace , who has won this tournament on six occasions , will face @entity85 's @entity84 for a place in the semifinals			0
" it was slightly frustrating at times clearly , but nevertheless i served well and kept on doing my thing , " said fourth - ranked @entity74 , who lost in the last 16 at @entity5			2
" it was important to stay calm and actually i think it gives me more confidence winning this way			0
" i had to stay calm , fight through the match and find a way and then the last set and a half were much better			0
so , i 'm actually pretty happy now			0
