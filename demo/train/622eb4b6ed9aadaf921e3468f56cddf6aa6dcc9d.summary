it turns out there 's a pesky little gremlin lurking around in the @entity5 equipment room deflating footballs			1
we should have known all along there was a logical explanation for the " @entity13 " scandal gripping the @entity12			2
that 's pretty much what @entity5 quarterback @entity15 and his coach @entity16 , would have us believe after their less - than illuminating press conferences yesterday			1
both men claimed they were just as stumped as us over how exactly 11 out of 12 of the team 's footballs used afc championship game against @entity24 had been illegally deflated below regulation specs			1
" when i came in monday morning , i was shocked to learn of the news reports about the footballs			2
i had no knowledge whatsoever of the situation , " said a famously crotchety @entity16			0
" i was completely totally unaware of anything			0
" his quarterback , appearing equally puzzled , wanted everyone to know that he 's no cheater : " i would never do anything to break the rules			2
i believe in fair play			2
i have no knowledge of anything ... no knowledge of any wrongdoing ... i do n't know what happened			0
" really @entity15 ? it 's hard to believe -- almost laughable , really -- that @entity15 , who is in his 15th @entity45 season with six trips to the @entity47 and three @entity47 wins , noticed nothing wrong			2
this is a guy who 's known to micromanage every aspect of the game , including the ball			1
and he 's on record saying he prefers a soft football			1
how could a pro like this notice nothing wrong ? the @entity45 , which according to @entity58 reports , had been put on notice by the @entity60 going into the afc championship game that the @entity5 may have used " soft balls " earlier in the season , said it is conducting a full investigation but with the @entity47 less than two weeks away , we 've heard nothing from them , nor apparently , has @entity15 , he said yesterday			1
so it 's easy to understand why fans and even pro athletes are not buying @entity15 's story : " it 's obvious that @entity15 had something to do with this , " said @entity72 qb @entity71 on his @entity74 radio program , even before the @entity15 - @entity16 press conferences			2
" so for the balls to be deflated , that does n't happen unless the quarterback wants that to happen , i can assure you of that			2
now the question becomes : did @entity16 know about it			0
" the evidence is clear : eleven of the team 's balls were illegally deflated and they did n't get there by themselves			1
all the talk about cold weather being the culprit ? forget it			0
not only was the temperature in the 50s on game day , but if weather was a factor then the @entity60 ' game balls would have also deflated			1
@entity15 , always the polished pitchman , is playing the innocent victim role perfectly			0
perhaps this is all just a conspiracy put out there by @entity5 haters , @entity15 suggested yesterday			1
good try but most reasonable people do not believe in conspiracy theories			2
and hopefully , even fewer people believe in invisible gremlins			0
so there must be another explanation			2
that leaves the @entity115 spectacle in the hands of @entity45 commissioner @entity117			0
the scandal has provided plenty of jokes for late - night television and @entity122			0
but cheating in the @entity45 , a $ 9.5 billion a year industry with an overall market value of $ 46 billion for its 32 teams , is no laughing matter			0
it 's been a rough year for the integrity of the game			1
@entity117 has admittedly made botched calls over several cases involving domestic abuse , with the @entity133 scandal being the most egregious			0
and this season has been littered with debatable play - calling in crucial game situations			1
this is no time for stalled investigations			0
a ruling on @entity13 after the @entity47 would be a huge letdown , and signal that cheating , no matter how blatant , is no big deal in the @entity45			0
@entity117 should act swiftly and announce sanctions against @entity5 before the @entity47 takes place in @entity144 on feburary 1			1
fans are not the only ones calling for the commissioner to clean this mess up			0
earlier this week , @entity150 sen. @entity149 called on @entity117 to restore the credibility of the game			2
" i am seeking decisive actions ensuring all teams are playing according to the rules , " @entity149 said in a statement			0
he recommended the league work with the @entity158 to resolve the issue ahead before the @entity47			0
let 's be clear : the @entity5 are second - time offenders when it comes to cheating			1
back in 2007 , @entity16 was fined the @entity45 maximum of $ 500,000 and the @entity5 were ordered to pay $ 250,000 for spying on an opponent 's ( the @entity166 ) defensive signals			1
in the end , the team 's assistant video guy took the fall and was the only person fired in the incident			2
the @entity5 also lost a draft pick in 2008			1
" this episode represents a calculated and deliberate attempt to avoid long - standing rules designed to encourage fair play and promote honest competition on the playing field , " @entity117 said at the time in a letter to the @entity5			1
@entity117 got it right back then : he handed out the biggest fine ever for an @entity45 coach and he sent a clear message that cheating would not be tolerated , or excused away			2
this time around , despite the billions of dollars attached to the @entity47 , @entity117 needs to go further			0
at a minimum , the commissioner should : -- disqualify the @entity5 from the @entity47 -- strip the team 's @entity190 title -- fine , or suspend @entity16 , who despite his claims to the contrary should have known about the deflated balls -- and even if he did n't , he 's ultimately responsible for everything that happens on the field			1
and if it can reasonably be argued that @entity15 knew or should have known based on his @entity45 expertise that the football has been tampered with , then he too should face tough sanctions			0
since there 's no precedent for disqualifying a @entity47 team , @entity117 would have to put a plan in place			0
it makes sense to me that the next best @entity190 team would go instead of the @entity5 , which means the @entity60 would play			1
and no , it does n't matter that @entity5 beat @entity24 , 45 - 7			1
the score is not the point when a team cheats			0
and if winning -- by any means necessary -- is really all that matters these days in the @entity45 , then we might as well throw out the rule books and stop preaching about the " sanctity of the game			0
" it 's 2015 and it seems the @entity5 still think the rules do n't apply to them			1
they have n't learned their lesson			0
this time around the commissioner must send an even stronger message so there 's no confusion			0
the @entity5 should be benched for @entity227			1
( note : an earlier version of this article listed the wrong opponent to the @entity5 in the afc championship game			1

@entity233 : the @entity5 have no good explanation for deflated footballs
why should they still be allowed to play in football 's biggest game ?
