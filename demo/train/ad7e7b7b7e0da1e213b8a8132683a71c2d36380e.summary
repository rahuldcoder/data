-- an abstinence - only education program is more effective than other initiatives at keeping sixth - and seventh - graders from having sex within a two - year period , according to a study described by some as a landmark			1
the study , published in the current issue of the @entity11 , indicated that about one - third of the preteens and their young teen classmates who received an eight - hour abstinence lesson had sexual intercourse within two years of the class			1
by comparison , more than half of the students who were taught about safe sex and condom use reported having intercourse by the two - year mark , and more than 40 percent of students who received either an eight - or 12 - hour lesson incorporating both abstinence education and safe sex reported having sex at two years			1
among students who received instruction on overall good health , but not having to do with sex directly , nearly 47 percent had sexual activity in the two years after the class			1
" this new study is game - changing , " the nonpartisan @entity34 to prevent teen and @entity36 said in a statement			2
" for the first time , there is strong evidence that an abstinence - only intervention can help very young teens delay sex and reduce their recent sexual activity as well			1
" the study is " quality research " and " good science , " said @entity51 , president of @entity52			0
according to its web site , the @entity54 - based organization promotes " a more positive and realistic approach to adolescent sexual health " in helping youths make informed and responsible decisions about sex and reproduction			1
the federal government has invested heavily in abstinence - only education in recent years			1
abstinence education funding , established in the 1996 overhaul of welfare , did not allow talk of any forms of birth control other than to explain their limitations			0
critics of such abstinence - only programs said their shortcomings led to a lack of knowledge of contraception among youths who choose to be sexually active			1
president @entity79 cut funding for abstinence - only education in his 2010 budget			1
the study did not impart any moral aspects to delaying the onset of intercourse , such as portraying sex in a negative light , @entity51 said			2
nor did the abstinence lesson ask students to delay intercourse until marriage -- only until they are ready			1
instead , the scientists said , they were interested in finding the effectiveness of various programs because adolescents who initiate intercourse at younger ages have a greater risk of sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy and report more sexually risky behavior , including multiple partners			2
the study looked at 662 african - american sixth - and seventh - graders recruited from four public middle schools that serve low - income communities in an unidentified city in the northeastern @entity110			1
the adolescents were recruited between september 2001 and march 2002			0
the participants ' average age was 12.2 years , and 53.5 percent were girls			0
although all young people are at risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections and having unintended pregnancies , the study says the danger is greatest among african - americans			1
" in 2005 , " the authors said , " 17 percent of adolescents in the @entity110 were @entity106 but 69 percent of adolescents with @entity125 were @entity106			2
rates of @entity128 are the highest among @entity106 individuals and adolescents , particularly adolescent girls			2
pregnancy rates have been higher among @entity106 adolescents than among their @entity135 and white counterparts			0
" the study 's authors -- @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 -- cautioned that abstinence programs are not an effective long - term solution			2
" a common shortcoming of behavior - change interventions is that efficacy is demonstrated in the short term but disappears at longer - term follow - up , " the report said			0
" this may particularly be a problem for abstinence interventions			0
unlike many risk behaviors ( e.g. , cigarette smoking , drug use ) , sexual intercourse is an age - graded behavior ; the expectation is that people will eventually have sexual intercourse			1
" the @entity34 to @entity161 and @entity36 echoed that sentiment			0
" it is unreasonable to expect any single intervention , curriculum or program to solve the teen pregnancy problem , " the nonprofit organization said			0
" true and lasting progress requires not only good programs in schools and communities , but also supportive norms and values , informed and active parents , good health services , a positive media culture and more			0
" @entity51 , president of @entity52 , said that in his opinion , the abstinence program does not go far enough toward helping youths who are sexually active make informed choices about contraception			2
he would like to see federal funding for programs aimed at abstinence and safe sex			1
" if you 've got 24 percent of your class that 's sexually active , what about them ? " @entity51 asked			0
in addition , he said , " ok , you 're 12			0
you 've abstained until 14			0
what about the next five years ? "			0
