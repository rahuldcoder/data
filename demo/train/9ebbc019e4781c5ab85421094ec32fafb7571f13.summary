-- e-mail is not usually considered as a form of mobile communication , but new research indicates that it might be time to rethink that			0
this week , a @entity7 study indicates that @entity8 are increasingly shifting e-mail usage from their computers to their mobile phones ( smartphones as well as most feature phones support e-mail ) and tablets			1
according to @entity7 , the number of people visiting web - based e-mail sites such as @entity18 or @entity20 mail from their computers in november 2010 declined 6 % compared to the previous year			1
meanwhile , the average number of pages viewed on e-mail sites declined even further , by 15 %			0
these statistics do not include usage of dedicated computer - based e-mail programs such as @entity28 or @entity29			1
during the same period , @entity7 reports , the number of people who accessed e-mail , both web - based and via dedicated apps , from their mobile devices grew by 36 %			1
overall , males were 14 % more likely than females to use mobile e-mail			0
teens aged 12 to 17 showed the steepest declines in computer - based web e-mail usage , with drops this year of 24 % in unique visitors to e-mail sites , 48 % in total minutes spent , and 53 % in total pages viewed -- likely a result of more teens messaging through social - media tools such as @entity49			1
but during the same period , this age group showed a 6 % rise in mobile e-mail usage			1
the strongest growth in mobile e-mail usage was for mobile users aged 25 to 34 ( 60 % increase ) and 18 to 24 ( 46 % increase )			2
but even the oldest demographic studied , age 65 + , showed a 25 % increase in mobile e-mail usage			1
@entity7 's research echoes earlier research by @entity64			0
their survey found that in may 2010 @entity8 mobile users spent far more time ( 38.5 % ) doing e-mail on their phones than any other internet - supported mobile activity			1
social media was a distant second , at 10.5 %			0
@entity7 vice president @entity74 speculates that the growth in mobile e-mail usage is driven primarily by the increasing penetration of smartphones			2
but the nearly ubiquitous availability and affordability of e-mail on feature phones could also play a strong role			2
@entity85 - enabled feature phones are common and affordable from every carrier			0
often e-mail service is included with the carrier 's basic data plans			0
in some cases , activating standalone e-mail service may cost a little extra -- $ 5 to $ 10/month -- for feature phones			0
feature phone users , still the vast majority of all @entity8 mobile users , often need e-mail access and either do n't own or frequently are n't near a computer			2
so they 're often willing to pay a modest fee to get mobile e-mail service .			0
