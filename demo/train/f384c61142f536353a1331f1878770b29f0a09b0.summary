-- the old adage " beauty is only skin deep " has turned out to be true , and filmmaker @entity4 is a living witness			1
for his latest documentary , " about face : @entity17 " -- premiering on @entity7 on monday --- the lensman exposes a side of the fashion business rarely seen by the masses , in which some of the most legendary and beautiful clotheshorses open up about their triumphs and struggles in and out of the spotlight			1
@entity7 is owned by @entity0 's parent company			1
the hour - plus - long film , which debuted this year at the @entity20 , features interviews with household names like @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 alongside industry pioneers such as @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
unlike other accounts of the fashion business -- such as popular fictional films like " @entity38 , " " @entity39 " and " @entity40 " and the documentary " @entity42 " -- " about face " let the models do the talking			1
" people go into the film thinking , ' oh , it 's going to be some kind of fluffy film about the fashion world , ' and then they leave it overwhelmed , " @entity4 said from his home in @entity46			1
" i think that everyone was very honest in the film , " he added			1
" and that 's what i appreciated , them giving me their 100 %			1
they gave me a lot and were very open			2
" the film begins with 81 - year - old @entity62 candidly comparing her plastic surgery to repairing a ceiling that 's falling down			2
the @entity46 native is regarded as the world 's oldest working model and started at @entity69 at the tender age of 15			1
another eyebrow - raising moment comes with anecdotes from another octogenarian : @entity75 , who became the first ethnic model to grace the cover of @entity78 in 1959 after legendary fashion photographer @entity79 blackmailed the magazine 's publisher into putting her on it			1
three years later , the @entity85 - born beauty would become fashion editor of the same publication			1
" it started out in this ' 70s and ' 80s world , " @entity4 explained			2
" and i realized that i wanted to go deeper in front of that , and i wanted to do people from the ' 60s and even the ' 50s			2
part of that was because they are still alive			2
you can still have a first - person conversation with ( them )			2
" the auteur behind such acclaimed documentaries as " @entity102 : @entity103 , " " @entity104 " and " @entity106 " series became inspired to do the project after a chance encounter			2
his friend @entity109 , a well - known fashion hairdresser , hosted a party three years ago in @entity46 as a reunion of sorts with people from the past who were his current @entity116 friends			1
@entity4 double - parked his car to run in for five minutes and ended up staying for hours			2
" my life changed , " he said			2
" i knew a few of their names , and there were a handful of models there , and i thought , ' this could be a interesting group portrait , ' " he said			1
" and that was the beginning of what i wanted to do			2
... as i got to know them , i realized that this could definitely be a film			2
" " i liked the idea of strong women who had kind of reinvented themselves , who have gone through tremendous fame and glamour and how they deal with that			0
" the conversation around ageism is what mostly piqued his interests , he admitted			0
" that 's something i think about a lot			0
i 'm 60 years old			0
how does the world treat you as you get older ? how do you deal with the fact that you 're not the best - looking person anymore if your life is all about your looks ? " @entity24 , the first @entity150 - @entity149 woman to grace the cover of @entity69 , appears in the film , as does another black beauty ( " one - eighth @entity150 , " she clarifies in " @entity154 " ) : @entity155 , who spoke poignantly about being attacked in the racist @entity157 during her early days modeling with the @entity158			0
@entity155 would flee the @entity149 for @entity161 until women of color were represented more in fashion in her homeland			1
@entity165 revealed how her grandmother , famed fashion designer @entity166 , ended a longtime friendship with then - @entity69 editrix @entity168 after she hired her as a model for the magazine			1
@entity26 opened up about how her long - term contract as a spokesmodel for @entity174 ´ me cosmetics ended once she turned 40			0
and @entity34 , who is more known for managing and shaping supermodels ' careers , shared intimate stories about growing up in @entity180 and how her mother thought she was a prostitute when she embarked on a modeling career			0
there were a few coveted cover girls , like @entity185 , who were out of his reach			0
" i think the film covers all of the areas that i wanted to cover			0
it covers the fun of fashion and modeling and the excitement of being that beautiful and having people turning everyone 's heads , " he noted			1
" it covers the drugs , the racism and the plastic surgery , and it 's a very wide - ranging film			0
and i like that about it			0
" @entity205 , one of the top models of the ' 80s , was elated to be a part of the film and to reconnect with friends she had n't seen in years			1
" modeling is a lonely business			0
we show up for jobs by ourselves , and each day is a new venture , no team , no office camaraderie			0
to be able to take a photo with my favorite models , doing what we did best , was a great day			1
" the former @entity223 spokesmodel released her literary debut , a novel titled " beauty to die for , " this week			0
like her book -- a sudsy murder mystery -- she said " about face " offers a voice for the silent			1
people do n't know or understand how we feel as we work			0
" @entity205 recently hobnobbed with some of the film 's subjects and the @entity46 glitterati at the premiere party at the @entity238 , which will house the corresponding portrait exhibit through september			0
" how good it was to hear these women 's past and present thoughts , how everyone looked so good -- still -- and what a great thought on the part of @entity4 to think it was worth sharing , " said model @entity240 , who attended the party			0
" no matter who you are , a good story is always worth listening to , and a beauty - related issue keeps it interesting			0
" with the increasing growth and mass appeal of image - savvy social media apps and smartphones ( equipped with state - of - the - art camera lenses ) @entity4 understands his lofty position as the poster child for portraiture			0
and it 's not something he takes for granted			0
" i have been very aware of this and how the world had gotten so much faster and bigger , and if you do n't have a photo show and a movie and a book and a dvd and a cd all at once , you just get lost , and i 've been lucky as an artist , because i started out as a filmmaker but then became a photographer , so i 'm skilled in all of these areas , " he said			1
" i think , if you can , you need to be in as many mediums as possible at the same time			0
