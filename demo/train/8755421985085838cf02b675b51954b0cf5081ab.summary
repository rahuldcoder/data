@entity0 -- the classroom walls tremble as a room full of 8 - year - olds bob heads , shrug shoulders and wriggle around in sync with the thud of the bass			1
an emcee runs up to the front of the room and yells " hip , " to which the children respond , " hop			1
" and with that , the " party " has begun			2
this is obviously not a typical class			2
it is more like what one organizer calls , " a party with a purpose " : a program called @entity26 , which uses music as a vehicle to communicate health messages to children			1
" music is an extremely powerful medium , " said dr. @entity31 , founder of the program			1
" great poets have described music as being the bridge between @entity38 , but i see music as the bridge between health education and the streets			1
" for nearly a decade , @entity26 has taken public health messages -- which , let 's face it , can sound boring if you 're a kid ( or an adult , for that matter ) -- and transformed them using clever rap lyrics and infectious beats			1
when @entity31 -- whose day job is chief of staff in the @entity54 at @entity55 -- had the idea of fusing hip - hop and public health , his next thought was that he needed serious help			1
" i 'm really hopeless , " he said , laughing			2
" i 'm a neurologist ; i 'm not a rapper			2
" @entity31 needed a partner , someone with hip - hop credibility , which he knew was essential to get through to inner city children			2
after a relentless pursuit , @entity31 scored a major coup when legendary rapper @entity68 ( also known as the " @entity69 " ) agreed to work with him			2
their first project , in 2005 , was presented at 10 schools in @entity73 , teaching children how to recognize a stroke			2
the main instrument of the interventions was a video populated by colorful animated characters doing a dance called " @entity81			1
" the song 's catchy refrain is , " if he do n't sound right , then he 's doing the stroke			2
sway when he walks , then he 's doing the stroke			2
slur when he talks , then he 's doing the stroke			2
" it then urges the children to " call 911 " if they recognize those symptoms			2
after several months , the pilot program seemed to be working , according to @entity31			1
not only were kids excited -- yes , excited -- to learn about stroke , they tended to share the messages they learned with family members at home			1
in addition , there are several stories of children saving family members in the grips of a brain attack			2
one child recognized that his grandmother was having a stroke and called 911 , saving her life			1
" that 's the power of children , the potential role that children can play within the public health chain of survival , " @entity31 said			1
" that ( story ) has always stayed with me , and that 's one of the things that really keeps me going			2
" with the stroke program , @entity31 realized he had tripped over a powerful communication model that could work for a whole host of diseases and conditions			1
so , he deepened his bench , adding rappers like @entity126 , a former member of the @entity128 ; @entity129 of @entity130 ; and @entity131 , of @entity131 , to his roster			0
the crew then dug into one the of the most pressing health problems facing minority communities : obesity			1
recent @entity139 data indicate that obesity rates are falling overall , but the rates among @entity143 and @entity145 - @entity144 children are still troublingly high			0
those children also tend to live in areas saturated with fast food chains , with little access to healthy foods			0
" @entity152 , " or @entity153 in schools , the program @entity31 and his rapper colleagues developed , tries to chip away at those issues			1
" everyone remembers their favorite song growing up , " said @entity157 , director of programming for @entity26			1
" even if you 're 5 , 6 , 7 years old , you always remember the words , the melody , how it made you feel when you listened to it			0
" that 's what we 're doing with our program , " he added			1
" we take health messages and attach them to good feelings , good memories , and that makes ( children ) incorporate those messages into their lives			1
" in one video titled " watch your calories , " a cartoon character , voiced by rapper @entity180 , admonishes two children who are about to eat fatty fast food meals to " stop right there for a second			0
before you super-size that no. 5 now , check it			0
see , there 's a whole lot of stuff in that meal you do n't need			0
" a menu appears , showing the sugars , carbohydrates and fats contained in their meals			0
an embedded message in the video is menu board literacy , providing children whose main option may be fast food with the information they need to make healthier choices			0
@entity31 admits that teaching children the importance of cooking meals at home and purchasing healthy groceries would also be effective , but he says that teaching " caloric literacy " can also provide a substantive impact			0
for example , he says , cutting 100 calories a day using better menu board literacy could translate to a few thousand calories over a few weeks			0
" these small changes are meaningful , and on a population level , these small changes could have very significant impact , " he said			0
another video developed for the obesity program teaches children how to achieve their anaerobic threshold , a measure of optimal performance while exercising			1
the video , titled " @entity230 , " uses a set of musical beats as a measuring stick for how effectively a child is exercising			0
if they breathe before the beats count is up , they are over-exerting themselves			0
if they do n't breathe enough , that means they 're not trying hard enough			0
and if they breathe once at the conclusion of the beats , they 've hit their anaerobic threshold			0
it is a complex concept simplified for young people			0
" it 's using hip - hop in a positive way , to have real impact , " @entity68 said			0
" we use beats that make you really wan na move			0
you 're not just gon na sit there ; you wan na get up and do something			0
" as it turns out , the programs for healthier eating and exercise are doing much more than simply making children move			0
peer - reviewed studies conducted by @entity31 and colleagues found that immediately after caloric literacy interventions , children changed their food purchases			0
" we found that caloric purchases declined by about 25 % , " @entity31 said			0
" so they were buying more healthy items as a result of the intervention			0
" the lingering question for this intervention -- and for the @entity275 more generally -- is how to sustain this change			0
after reaching tens of thousands of children in @entity0 , @entity26 got a shout - out -- and a request to collaborate -- from the @entity280 , whose ambassador is first lady @entity283			1
what evolved from that partnership is an album , releasing monday , called " @entity287			1
" the album moves the songs beyond hip - hop into other genres ( some of the artists contributing to the album include @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 ) and will be distributed , along with a curriculum , to schools nationwide			1
@entity31 is convinced the model that began in @entity0 , with a neurologist and a few rappers , could make a powerful impact in schools across the country			1
" this really teaches us how impressionable kids are and how we have an opportunity to shape their behaviors at a young age , " he said .			1

@entity26 uses music to communicate health messages to kids
the program is coming out with an album called " @entity287 "
