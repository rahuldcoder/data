images from the conflict between @entity2 and @entity3 depict apparent civilians , innocent people caught in the middle			1
often , the dead are children			0
the @entity9 death toll in @entity10 stands at more than 1,800 , with nearly 10,000 wounded , @entity10 's @entity11 said sunday			1
more than 300 children have died , the ministry has reported , as the @entity14 repeatedly raises concerns about the high number of deaths in @entity10			1
on the @entity2 side , 64 @entity2 soldiers and three civilians have died since fighting began more than three weeks ago			1
why are the death tolls lopsided ? why so many deaths in @entity10 ? here are five reasons that dictate the brutal logic of the latest @entity27 crisis			1
uneven resources while @entity3 has shown itself to be a formidable guerrilla army , @entity2 's military dwarfs the resources available to the militant @entity33 organization , which controls @entity10			1
@entity3 does not have the sophisticated weaponry and technology that @entity2 possesses			1
consider @entity2 's @entity37 system , which intercepts and blocks incoming rockets			1
the @entity2 military has said that it has depleted most of @entity10 's rocket supply and @entity41 says more than 3,000 rockets have been fired from @entity10 at @entity2			1
unlike @entity10 , @entity2 has bomb shelters and an advanced warning system to let its population know when and where rockets are coming in			1
hundreds of thousands of people have reportedly downloaded @entity49 , a smartphone app that uses real - time information from the @entity41 and the country 's version of @entity54 to trigger a phone 's alarm when rockets are detected			2
illustrating just how powerful @entity2 is in this battle , @entity2 has been texting @entity9 ' cell phones with messages warning where the @entity2 military will strike			1
@entity9 have told @entity62 they are receiving these messages			0
@entity2 has also been doing what it calls " roof knocking " -- or dropping empty shells on rooftops -- warning those inside buildings to get out fast because a strike with explosive shells is imminent			1
" civilian casualties in @entity10 have been too high , " @entity72 spokesman col. @entity71 said in @entity73 on thursday			1
" it is clear the @entity2 need to do more			1
we want them to do more			0
" the nature of the battlefield more than 1.8 million people live in @entity10 , which is 139 square miles in total land area			1
that makes for very cramped living			0
when airstrikes happen , when shells land , having more people in a small area often means higher death tolls			2
and even if @entity9 receive and heed warnings to change locations before an airstrike hits , it 's likely they 'll have nowhere safe to run			0
there are no bomb shelters or warning sirens in @entity10			1
and it 's practically impossible to leave			2
there 's a barrier fence around the perimeter of @entity10			1
@entity2 controls all air access to @entity10 and land access along their border			1
@entity104 controls access on the southern border and that crossing is also closed			0
@entity14 schools in @entity10 -- with clear @entity14 markings -- have been turned into shelters during the conflict , and for a while they were considered safe			1
but strikes have recently hit several of those locations , killing and injuring many , including women and children			0
each side blames the other			0
in some cases , @entity2 has said @entity3 rockets were launched and fell short , landing on the schools , and stressed that it uses " precision " airstrikes			1
regarding shells that fell in the vicinity of a school on sunday , killing at least nine people , the @entity41 said it targeted three @entity129 members riding a motorcycle in the vicinity of the school			2
it said it 's reviewing the incident			0
@entity3 says @entity2 targeted the schools			1
a goal that could take time one of @entity2 's top goals is to destroy @entity3 rockets and tunnels			1
it says it has uncovered 36 tunnels running from @entity10 into @entity2 that have been used to smuggle weapons and launch attacks			1
@entity3 has released videos of militants using the tunnels for attacks			0
the main way to obliterate the tunnels is by airstrikes and artillery bombardment , and those tactics often result in collateral damage			0
the tunnels have , for some time , also been used as vital supply lines to @entity10 , through which food and other necessities have been transported			1
the tunnels were dug to get around the blockade of @entity10 , said @entity154 , the head of the @entity156 delegation to the @entity157			1
but @entity154 told @entity62 's @entity158 , who toured a tunnel , that the tunnels have also been used by a faction of @entity9 to launch attacks in @entity2			1
@entity9 parliament member @entity162 described the tunnels as a defensive tool against repeated @entity2 invasions in recent years			2
watch : @entity62 's @entity158 goes into a tunnel in @entity10 effort to protect civilians ? is @entity3 willing to put civilians in harm 's way ? that 's a controversial topic			2
last month , rockets were discovered in a vacant @entity14 school between two other @entity14 schools being used as shelters			0
it was the second such discovery at a vacant @entity14 school in @entity10 in a week			2
that is the evidence @entity2 cites to accuse @entity3 of using civilians and their institutions as shields -- a violation of international law			2
@entity2 prime minister @entity183 said on @entity62 that it was difficult to measure the bloodshed of the conflict because " @entity3 is using them , @entity9 , as human shields			2
" " we develop anti-missile systems to protect , we use anti-missile systems to protect our civilians , " he said			2
" they use their civilians to protect their missiles			0
" the @entity41 said monday it found a " @entity3 combat manual " that @entity41 says proves the group uses its people as human shields			0
a @entity62 translation of the two pages posted by the @entity41 did not find specific statements that @entity3 uses its own civilian population as human shields , but one section discusses the benefits for @entity3 when civilian homes are destroyed			0
@entity62 could not confirm the authenticity of the manual , and neither the @entity41 nor @entity3 could be reached for comment			0
experts say the situation is complex			0
@entity3 is also a political organization embedded in civilian life in the @entity9 territory , @entity9 leaders say			0
" @entity3 is a political party after all , not just a military wing			0
and it has institutions , organizations , homes " in @entity10 , said @entity220 , executive committee member of the @entity156 in the @entity221			2
she pointed out that large buildings are being hit , and many are dying inside			0
" it would be impossible at this point to say how much truth there is to the human shield argument , " said @entity227 of the @entity228			0
" that 's not going to be possible to do in the heat of the conflict			0
" the timetable is uncertain last week , the @entity2 military said it was calling up 16,000 reservists , an indication that there is likely more fighting ahead			2
@entity157 diplomacy has tried to turn the situation toward a lasting cease - fire			0
several @entity27 nations attempted to get @entity3 to agree to an @entity104 - led cease - fire while @entity157 secretary of state @entity248 met with @entity9 and @entity2 leaders last week			2
but by thursday evening , rockets were still flying and sirens were going off			0
several cease - fires have fallen apart since			0
@entity252 said in a speech recently that she felt there is a " strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated , in a manner that could amount to war crimes			0
" " i unequivocally reiterate to all actors in this conflict that civilians must not be targeted , " she said , adding , " respect for the right to life of civilians , including children , should be a foremost consideration			0

officials : more than 1,800 people have died ; 64 @entity2 soldiers have died
@entity2 has more resources , more sophisticated weapons and warning systems
in most cases , those who live in @entity10 can not simply leave
