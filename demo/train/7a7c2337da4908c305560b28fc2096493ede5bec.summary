-- @entity3 leaders @entity1 crashed to their second defeat in a week as @entity7 's first - ever @entity6 hat - trick earned them a comfortable 3 - 1 victory at @entity9			1
@entity1 had lost just once this season prior to last tuesday 's visit to @entity11 , but a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity13 followed by sunday 's reversal , means they now lead @entity15 by three points at the top -- although the @entity18 have a vital game in hand			1
@entity1 were missing their first choice central defensive pairing of @entity22 and @entity23 , and their absence showed as the home side deservedly took a two - goal half - time lead			2
@entity27 broke the deadlock in the 34th minute after some superb play from @entity30			0
the @entity32 striker twisted and turned in the area , skipping around three challenges before getting to the by - line and knocking the ball across the area for @entity7 to apply the simplist of finishes from in front of goal			0
and , just five minutes later , @entity6 doubled their advantage when @entity1 winger @entity43 inexplicably headed @entity30 's cross from the right back towards goal -- and an unmarked @entity7 was on hand to nod home his second from close range			1
@entity1 went close to pulling a goal back in the second half when @entity54 's close - range header hit the chest of @entity56 on the goal - line			0
and they were made to pay for that miss when @entity7 completed his hat - trick , again from close range , converting a 65th - minute rebound after goalkeeper @entity62 had parried @entity30 's free - kick into his path			1
@entity1 pulled one back in the final minute when substitute @entity65 nodded home @entity67 ' right - wing cross from close range , but the goal had no impact on the final outcome and @entity6 were able to give a second - half debut to record signing @entity74 -- the most expensive @entity76 player in history following his $ 55m deadline day transfer from @entity80			2
the result lifts @entity6 back up to sixth place in the table , six points behind fourth - placed @entity11 although they have played two matches more			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's poor away form , they have won just four matches on their travels , continues to hinder their title chances			2
the late afternoon game saw struggling @entity91 draw 3 - 3 at home to @entity93 in a thrilling see - saw encounter			1
the home side took the lead when @entity97 flicked home a close - range header but @entity101 striker @entity100 scored two superb goals from outside the area to give @entity93 the lead			0
remarkably they were @entity100 's first @entity3 goals of a season disrupted by injuries			0
however , @entity108 were level before half - time after @entity97 added his second from the penalty spot after @entity113 had tugged back @entity114			0
in an end - to - end match , another fine strike -- this time from @entity116 -- looked to have given @entity93 the three points that would have seen them move above @entity11 into fourth place			1
but a superb back post header from substitute @entity121 with just three minutes remaining ensured the honors finished even , although a draw helps neither side at opposite ends of the table			0
wolves remain second bottom of the table with 29 points , although only nine points separate ninth place @entity80 with bottom team @entity133			0
meanwhile , @entity93 remain fifth , level on points with @entity11 although they have played a game more than their @entity138 rivals .			2

@entity7 's first - ever @entity6 hat - trick sees his team beat @entity1 3 - 1
@entity1 lead the @entity3 table by three points but @entity15 have a game in hand
the defeat is @entity1 's second in a week following their 2 - 1 reverse at @entity11
@entity91 score a late *equalizer* to draw a thrilling game with @entity93 3 - 3
