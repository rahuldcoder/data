@entity0 left behind a 107,000 - word " story " of what the shooting suspect called his " twisted world			1
" while he e-mailed it to his parents and a therapist the day he allegedly went on a terror rampage , investigators and journalists soon found it			2
the central theme of " @entity13 : the @entity17 " is his intractable virginity , which he blamed on " the cruelness of women			1
" here are five revelations from this disturbing document : 1			2
' a bitter form of envy ' @entity0 grew up on the edges of @entity23 but was not quite a part of it			1
his father , @entity26 , aspired to make films , but he mostly directed commercials			2
his mother " dated @entity29 for a short time " and was a friend of @entity33 's , he wrote			2
his stepmother , @entity34 , acted in a few movies and was a regular on the @entity38 version of " @entity39 , " produced in @entity40			2
these connections got him into a few " @entity48 " premieres and the premiere on march 12 , 2012 , for the first installment of " @entity45 , " for which his father worked as a second - unit director			2
@entity0 wrote that the movie was " entertaining " and the premiere " was an extraordinary experience , " but he said he " felt very bitter that i was n't able to bring a girl with me as a date			1
the majority of men at the event had a date with them , and i felt so pathetic for not having a date			1
if only a girl at my collage had been attracted to me ; i would have gladly brought her to the premiere as my date			2
" he attended a private @entity63 concert the night before , thanks to wealthy friends who gave the tickets to the @entity0 family			1
@entity0 wrote about how seeing how rich families enjoy life made him resent that his " damnable mother " had not " married into wealth instead of being selfish			1
" " i could n't help but feel a bitter form of envy at all of the rich kids at the concert			2
they grew up in lavish mansions , indulged in excessive opulence , and will never have to worry about anything in their pleasurable , hedonistic lives			2
i would take great pleasure in watching all of those rich families burn alive			2
looking at all of them really drilled in my mind the importance of wealth			2
@entity0 's parents frantically searched for son during shooting " wealth is one of the most important defining factors of self - worth and superiority			1
i hated and envied all of those kids for being born into wealth , while i had to struggle to find a way to claim wealth for myself			2
i had to be ruthless , and do whatever it takes to attain such wealth			2
after all , it was my only hope of ever being worthy of getting a girlfriend and living the life of gratification that i desire			1
" @entity0 lamented being " a kissless virgin			1
' @entity106 # 9 ' advice @entity108 , who wrote and directed several movies about relationships , tried to teach @entity0 how to get a girlfriend , according to @entity0 's writing			1
@entity108 , a friend of @entity0 's father , wrote " @entity114 , " " @entity106 # 9 " and " @entity116			1
" " he wanted to help me overcome my troubles because he is a so - called expert with women			1
he even showed me pictures of all of the gorgeous women he has dated in his life , and there were a lot of them			1
" a few men who are successful with women have offered me help and advice about this in the past , but nothing ever came of it			1
i suppose they want to help because it would be a boost to their already big egos , and also because they feel sorry for me			2
people should feel sorry for me			2
my life is so pathetic , and i hate the world for forcing me to suffer it			1
i feel sorry for myself			2
" in truth , there is nothing men like @entity108 can really do to help me attract girls and lose my virginity			2
they ca n't mind - control girls to be attracted to me			0
my brief friendship with @entity108 would , however , spark a few more interesting e-mail conversations where i confide to him about how cruel i think women are by nature			1
he would only be amused by this			0
of course he would be amused			0
women were never cruel to him			1
they gave him sex and love all his life			1
" @entity154 e-mailed @entity108 's rep for comment sunday evening but has not heard back yet			0
winning a lottery : ' the only way out ' @entity0 became convinced that winning the @entity160 lottery was his destiny			1
he began obsessively playing it and even drove to @entity163 from @entity164 four times to buy @entity167 tickets			0
" i saw winning the lottery as the only way out , " he wrote			1
" i knew i was always destined for great things			0
this must be it ! i was destined to be the winner of the highest lottery jackpot in existence			1
i knew right then and there that this jackpot was meant for me			0
who else deserved such a victory ? i had been through so much rejection , suffering , and injustice in my life , and this was to be my salvation			1
with my whole body filled with feverish hope , i spent $ 700 dollars on lottery tickets for this drawing			1
as i spent this money , i imagined all the amazing sex i would have with a beautiful model girlfriend i would have once i become a man of wealth			0
" grieving father after rampage : ' when will this insanity stop ? ' after repeatedly not winning the lottery , @entity0 saw that his plan for his " @entity198 " against the world " was more real than ever before			1
" " without the prospect of becoming wealthy at a young age , i had nothing to live for now			0
i was going to be a virgin outcast forever			1
i realized that i had to start planning and preparing for the @entity198 , even though i had n't yet had any idea of what day that would be			0
@entity0 's three guns @entity0 began practicing shooting at a gun range in @entity207 , @entity164 , after failing to win the $ 120 million @entity160 lottery in september 2012 , according to his writing			1
" i had the knowledge , in the back of my mind , that the @entity198 was very possible now			0
going to the shooting range while i waited for my laptop gave me the perfect opportunity to gain some initial training in shooting guns , which will be the main weapons i use as vengeance against my enemies when the @entity198 ultimately comes to pass			0
" i walked into the range , rented a handgun from the ugly old redneck cashier , and started to practice shooting at paper targets			0
as i fired my first few rounds , i felt so sick to the stomach			0
i questioned my whole life , and i looked at the gun in front of me and asked myself ' what am i doing here ? how could things have led to this ? ' i could n't believe my life was actually turning out this way			1
there i was , practicing shooting with real guns because i had a plan to carry out a massacre			0
" rejection , jealousy and vow to kill ' beautiful girls ' his first " act of preparation " for the massacre was the purchase of his first gun , he wrote			0
" i had already done some research on handguns , and i decided to purchase the @entity248 semiautomatic pistol , an efficient and highly accurate weapon			0
i signed all of the papers and was told that my pickup day was in mid-december			0
that fell in nicely , because that was when i was planning on staying in @entity255 till			0
after i picked up the handgun , i brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power			0
" he bought his second handgun in the spring of 2013 , when he " began to seriously think about planning the @entity198 , " he wrote			0
he bought a third gun a year later			0
" i needed to buy a third handgun , just in case one of them jams			0
i needed two working handguns at the same time , as that was how i planned to commit suicide ; with two simultaneous shots to the head			0
i also needed to buy magazine clips and ammunition , as well as knives and carrying cases for my equipment			0
vengeance against men @entity0 wrote that the " first phase " of his massacre plan would be to stab his two male roommates to death			1
" these were the biggest nerds i had ever seen , and they were both very ugly with annoying voices , " he wrote			0
" if they were pleasant to live with , i would regret having to kill them , but due to their behavior i now had no regrets about such a prospect			0
in fact , i 'd even enjoy stabbing them both to death while they slept			0
" " after that , i will start luring people into my apartment , knock them out with a hammer , and slit their throats			0
i will torture some of the good looking people before i kill them , assuming that the good looking ones had the best sex lives			0
all of that pleasure they had in life , i will punish by bringing them pain and suffering			1
i have lived a life of pain and suffering , and it was time to bring that pain to people who actually deserve it			1
" the @entity312 identified the three men found dead in @entity0 's apartment as @entity315 , 20 ; @entity316 , 19 ; and @entity317 , 20			1
@entity315 and @entity316 were his roommates , while @entity317 was visiting the apartment , the sheriff 's office said			0
