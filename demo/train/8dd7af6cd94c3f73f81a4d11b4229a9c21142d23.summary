@entity0 , @entity1 left to drill and are expected to break through into the area where 33 miners are trapped by saturday , @entity1 mines minister @entity3 said thursday			1
depending on whether engineers decide to encase the rescue shaft with steel casing , the 33 miners could be extracted from the collapsed @entity12 gold and copper mine within two to 10 days after breakthrough , @entity3 added			1
the miners have been trapped in a chamber since august 5			0
they are in contact with the outside world through a small bore hole that is being used to send them food , water , supplies and other necessities			0
rescue crews have been drilling three separate , wider holes to send down a rescue capsule that will bring the men to the surface			0
those rescue attempts have been labeled @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 " we 're advancing pretty well in @entity34 we restarted the drilling process and are hoping we can get contact more or less this saturday			2
depending [ on ] if we have to change the drill hammer or not it could be a bit earlier , but we 're predicting [ the ] date for saturday , " @entity3 said			0
mine engineers will have to decide whether they need to encase the shaft with steel tubing to prevent rockfalls and further collapses as they extract the miners			1
" we have to wait two , three or four days if we do not encase and eight to 10 days if we do the encasing			1
that will be based on technical matters decided by technical experts , " he added			0
. the so - called @entity34 drill , a @entity52 t - 130 rig , hit a depth of 535 meters by 8 a.m. thursday following a 20 - hour stoppage to change drill hammers and to survey the rescue shaft with a miniature camera			1
earlier this week , the @entity34 drill cut through 53 meters in just 12 hours , which means technically it could cover the remaining 89 meters down to the miners in just 20 hours			1
one of the rescue coordinators , @entity61 , an engineer for state copper company @entity62 , said earlier this week they may encase the first 100 meters of the shaft , a process that could take just 10 hours			1
once the miners are extracted they will undergo about two hours of health checks at a field hospital that has been set up at the mine			0
they will then be reunited with one or two immediate family members			0
next , all 33 will be flown by military helicopter to the regional hospital in the city of @entity0 -- approximately a 15 - minute flight			0
@entity1 president @entity75 said on sept. 19 during his last visit to the mine that he planned to personally hug each of the 33 miners as they were pulled from the rescue shaft			1
he is due to depart on a government tour to @entity83 mid-month			0
first lady @entity84 is expected to arrive at the @entity12 mine sometime friday , @entity3 said			2
" her plan is to spend some time with the miners ' families , " he said			2
@entity89 , sister of trapped miner @entity90 , said relatives would begin a vigil thursday night that they will keep until a drill breaks through to the miners .			2
