@entity0 -- @entity2 plans to hold special courses to train government leaders in ways of managing online public opinion , according to a report in state - run media			1
the report by the @entity11 new agency said @entity2 had one billion internet users " making the shape of our society more complicated ... managing online public opinion has already become a central fixture of managing our society			1
" management of the @entity21 is now a " big task for all of our country 's leaders , at every level , " the report added			1
the six - day course -- to run from march 27 to april 1 -- aims to use " use case studies , simulations , group discussions " to train " government organs and administrative units " who would be examined and awarded a certificate ranking them either an analyst or manager of " internet public opinion			2
" ' directing ' discussions according to the course website , the program shows ways of directing online discussions on " mass incidents " -- shorthand for civil unrest and rioting that breaks out periodically in @entity2 towns and cities -- and even uses discussion on the @entity51 of the 1960s and 1970s as an example of a contentious social issue			1
the @entity2 government has only just permitted discussion of the tumultuous political period , which was marked by paralyzing social upheaval			1
another part of the course discusses the influence of popular bloggers -- called " @entity65 " users on @entity64 -- who must maintain a sense of " social responsibility " in their posts , according to the program website			1
" @entity65 should proactively conform to state management departments in striking down rumors and purifying the online environment , " it stated			1
spread of rumors @entity2 's president @entity78 has tightened controls over the internet since coming to power in 2012 , bringing in tough legislation to control the " spread of rumors " online			2
last year , the @entity85 issued new guidelines stating that any false defamatory post online that is viewed 5,000 times or forwarded 500 times could be deemed " severe " and result in a prison sentence of up to three years for the culprit			0
microblogging has exploded in @entity2 in recent years , presenting a serious pressure point to a government that has built an industry around restricting comment			1
microblogging campaigns have targeted corruption , suspicious lawsuits , kidnapped children and the plight of activist lawyers			0
despite this , however , large @entity21 companies such as @entity64 and @entity104 employ content monitors to make sure their sites do not contravene @entity2 information laws			2
according to @entity2 internet entrepreneur @entity111 , the banks of censors are often regarded by @entity21 companies as simply a requirement in @entity2 of doing business in a new industry			2
" almost half the team at @entity64 are engaged in monitoring content at some level			0
even so , @entity120 is very bold but they are under pressure as well -- they still have to be responsive to the government			0
@entity125 , @entity124 banned unrestricted social networking sites such as @entity125 and @entity124 are banned on mainland @entity2 and only determined or relatively wealthy individuals use virtual private networks ( @entity129 ) to get around the @entity2 internet restrictions , which have been dubbed " the @entity131			0
" even so , cracks have occasionally appeared in the wall			0
according to a report in @entity0 's @entity136 , @entity134 could soon lift a ban on internet access within the @entity139 , allowing access to @entity125 , @entity124 and newspaper website @entity142			0
" in order to welcome foreign companies to invest and to let foreigners live and work happily in the free - trade zone , we must think about how we can make them feel like at home , " the report quoted a government source as saying			0
" if they ca n't get onto @entity125 or read the @entity142 , they may naturally wonder how special the free - trade zone is compared with the rest of @entity2			0
