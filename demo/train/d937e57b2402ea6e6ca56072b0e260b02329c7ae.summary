@entity0 -- @entity2 looked to capitalize on its early sales lead in the console wars at its @entity6 media briefing on monday , repeating the mantras of " first , " " better " and " only on " as selling points for its @entity9			1
hours earlier , rival @entity11 stuck strictly to games for the @entity14 in a similar briefing			0
but @entity2 's presentation included new hardware and non-gaming services as well as promises of exclusive titles and titles that will launch on @entity9 before coming to other consoles			1
@entity23 , president and ceo of @entity25 , said the company aims to make the @entity9 " the best place to play			1
" @entity28 , a video game columnist for the @entity30 , noted that the more inclusive presentation was a bit of a switch with @entity11 , which last year focused on the @entity14 's entertainment potential while , in some eyes , giving games less than their due			0
" @entity2 pulled a 180 and switched roles , " @entity28 said			2
" last year , they did n't talk very much about the ( services and non-game content )			0
" he added , though , that " there was a lot of good content , games-wise " to go along with the extras this year			0
one of the biggest crowd reactions of the presentation came when " @entity48 " was announced for november			1
@entity49 , the lead character in the puzzle - platform series , will get three new friends to join him in amazing new worlds , as well as the 8.7 million levels created by current " @entity48 " players			2
and a never - before - seen trailer , created using the @entity9 , announced that " uncharted 4 : a thief 's end , " will be arriving for the console in 2015			1
on the hardware front , @entity2 announced that @entity61 will be available in the @entity62 later this year			1
already available in @entity63 as @entity64 , the $ 99 micro-console will allow users to play more than 1,000 games on their television and stream music and video from sites like @entity72			0
a new " @entity73 also will be released later this year , bundled with the action shooter " @entity75 , " which will be released in september			0
the surprise success of the @entity77 -- a $ 60 add - on to the console -- and @entity79 , @entity2 's attempt at a virtual - reality headset , also got mentions			2
other announcements included a partnership with @entity84 that will let players automatically upload video to the site , a video - streaming service ( @entity89 ) and two pieces of original entertainment -- a movie based on the " @entity97 " series and an animated series based on the graphic novel " @entity96			1
" " the thirst for innovation at @entity73 is tremendous , " said @entity98 , president and ceo of @entity25			0
@entity9 sales jumped out to a quick lead over the @entity14 when both consoles were released in november , and it has outsold @entity11 's offering for four straight months this year			2
it 's worth noting , though , that both are outselling their last - generation counterparts to date , and that @entity9 is currently available in more countries than the @entity14 .			0
