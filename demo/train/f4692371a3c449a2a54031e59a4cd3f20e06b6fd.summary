president @entity0 appointed me as the nation 's first director of national drug control policy -- or " drug czar " -- in 1989			1
we took on many big fights , the largest of which was the cocaine epidemic spreading from the jungles of @entity12 to the streets of the @entity14			0
we conducted an all - out assault on drugs through tough enforcement measures and public education			0
contrary to " war on drugs " critics , drug use and addiction dropped across the country			1
the issue of marijuana legalization was far less prominent than it is today , although even then , some argued that we should experiment with legalization			1
i told them not on my watch ; the cost to society would be too great			1
if you do n't want to take my word that it can be harmful , perhaps you 'll take @entity35 's			1
in a recent interview , the world - famous pop star admitted she was heavily addicted to marijuana			2
" i have been addicted to it and it 's ultimately related to anxiety coping and it 's a form of self - medication and i was smoking up to 15 or 20 marijuana cigarettes a day with no tobacco , " she said			1
" i was living on a totally other psychedelic plane , numbing myself completely			0
" @entity35 said she was speaking out to bust the myth that marijuana is just a harmless plant			1
" i just want young kids to know that you actually can become addicted to it , and there 's this sentiment that you ca n't and that 's actually not true			2
" today a fully functioning experiment in legal marijuana for adults is going on in @entity60 and another one is set to begin later this year in @entity62			1
@entity63 once remarked that in our democratic republic , the states are the laboratories of democracy			0
we are running a few labs now and shall see what happens			0
but , as with any public debate , we need to hear all sides			0
so far , the advocates of marijuana legalization have dominated the public arena			2
it 's certainly had an effect			2
according to a new @entity80 poll , a majority of @entity14 support legalizing marijuana			2
but where are the voices of the wounded ? where is the outrage from the families who have been hurt ? we know they are out there			0
more americans are admitted to treatment facilities for marijuana use than any other illegal drug			1
i 've talked to parents all over the country who lost children to drug abuse -- not to marijuana alone ; though in many cases it was a gateway drug or part of their deadly drug concoction			1
people have been deeply hurt by drug related accidents or spent thousands of dollars on drug rehabilitation			2
we need to hear their voices			0
during my tenure as drug czar , i traveled to more than 120 communities to see firsthand the impact of illegal drugs			1
among those visits was a trip to @entity118 to take part in drug busts in some of the city 's most broken and dangerous neighborhoods			1
not once during that visit did a parent or community leader advocate for legalization or loosening drug restrictions			2
rather , they wanted the drugs confiscated and drug dealers locked up			2
they knew the damage drugs had inflicted on their children and communities			0
that same evening @entity135 held a discussion on drugs and law enforcement			0
there i listened to scores of academics argue for legalizing or decriminalizing drugs			0
it 's hardly an exercise in intellectual rigor for those in the middle - and upper - class who live in areas with little crime and violence to be willing to experiment with drug legalization			1
they live far removed from the realities of the drug trade			2
but travel to its core , to the slums and projects run by ruthless drug dealers , and these intellectuals may rethink their position			2
it 's a myth that marijuana , because it is not as harmful as cocaine , heroin or some other illegal hard drugs , is safe or safe enough to warrant legalization			1
opponents contest that marijuana has n't ravaged communities or that the drug itself is n't to blame			1
but that 's not true			0
it 's ravaged the community of the young			0
marijuana is the most widely used drug in the country , especially among young people			1
according to the 2012 @entity183 on @entity184 and @entity185 , " of the 7.3 million persons aged 12 or older classified with illicit drug dependence or abuse in 2012 , 4.3 million persons had marijuana dependence or abuse , " making marijuana the drug with the largest number of people with dependence or abuse			1
the medical community has warned about the danger			0
a recent @entity198 study found that marijuana users have abnormal brain structure and poor memory and that chronic marijuana abuse may lead to brain changes resembling schizophrenia			1
the study also reported that the younger the person starts using marijuana , the worse the effects become			0
in its own report arguing against marijuana legalization , the @entity208 said : " heavy cannabis use in adolescence causes persistent impairments in neurocognitive performance and @entity215 , and use is associated with increased rates of anxiety , mood and psychotic thought disorders			0
" the country can ill - afford a costly experiment with drugs			0
while we are undergoing a national debate over improving health care costs and education performance , legalizing marijuana will undercut those vital missions			0
we will wait and see what @entity60 's and @entity62 's experiments hold , but i expect that after several years , we will see marijuana use rise dramatically , even among adolescents			1
the states will come to regret their decisions			0
as the late , great political scientist @entity237 remarked , " the central problem with legalizing drugs is that it will increase drug consumption " -- and all its inherent harm .			0

@entity243 , nation 's first " drug czar , " believes legal marijuana is bad for society
@entity243 says @entity35 agrees that pot is addictive and not just a harmless plant
@entity243 : medical studies find chronic use leads to abnormal brain structure , bad memory
@entity243 : @entity60 and @entity62 will come to regret decision to legalize pot for adults
