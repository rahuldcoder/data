-- when @entity2 has come and gone , and the turkey gorge is over , you 'll probably open up your refrigerator and find all sorts of tinfoil - wrapped casseroles and a lingering eau de sage			1
what 's a severely yammed out but unwasteful eater to do ? that 's where @entity11 comes in			1
@entity13 is the winner of season 5 of " @entity16 " and host of the @entity18 show " @entity19			1
" she gives us her five tips for @entity2 leftovers			1
freeze while fresh why wait until your turkey has aged two extra days until you realize that you are in over your @entity2 head ? on @entity2 , as you are cleaning up after dinner , immediately cube up half the remaining turkey and package it up into quart - sized freezer bags , about a cup or two each portion , depending on the size of your family			1
label and freeze , and now you 'll have the freshest leftover possible that becomes an easy ingredient in the freezer just waiting to have a second life a month or two down the road in another recipe : pasta , soup , savory pies , omelets , etc. 2			1
tired of turkey ? trick your tastebuds my saturday strategy for the turkey i still have around ? go ethnic or regional with these creative ideas			1
think @entity51 ( turkey pad @entity51 , for instance ) , @entity54 ( turkey taquitos ) or @entity57 bbq ( pulled - turkey sandwiches )			1
a whole different flavor profile will break the mold on @entity2 flavors , and you 'll fool your palate into thinking your dish is a fresh new idea , not a recycled leftover			1
@entity67 's gone , but what about all the rest ? repurpose your sides we all have side dishes that we make out of tradition , but that are n't eaten quite as much as we would hope			0
the result is leftover overload ! cranberry sauce is a major culprit in my house			1
the solution ? think of cranberry sauce simply as a tart fruit , and use as you would use any other			0
make a yogurt parfait , or toss with apple slices and make a cobbler or crumble , or heat up and pour on vanilla ice cream and top with toasted pecans for a sundae			0
you can even make a fantastic sweet - heat salsa ( perfect with my turkey taquitos , above )			1
the other major leftover is the ( in ) famous yams			2
one idea : think breakfast ! make a delicious maple - yam compound butter and serve with scones or waffles			0
turn sweetened yams into a filling for empanadas , or make cinnamon bran muffins with them			2
on the savory side , try swirling some yams into your leftover mashed potatoes for a delicious marbled potato side dish			1
( i know ; i did n't give you any ideas for stuffing			0
but if you have stuffing leftovers , you need a new recipe			0
ingredients are leftovers too , so scan the fridge remember one of my cardinal rules of saving grocery dollars : wasted food is the most expensive food you buy , no matter how cheap it was at the store			2
so , be sure to check your refrigerator for lurking ingredients on their last legs so that you can leverage all your leftovers instead of tossing them			2
use that leftover heavy cream you bought for mashed potatoes to make a quick homemade spicy butterscotch pudding			2
use half a sour cream container to make your mom 's crazy @entity138			0
find a way to use up the other half ( those taquitos bail us out yet again ! )			2
a good general strategy is to check your refrigerator weekly ( ideally just before menu planning or grocery shopping ) , and pull any ' must - use ' ingredients front and center of the fridge so you do n't forget about them			0
feel good about less sometime between @entity151 and the @entity152 , do a major purge of stuff you do n't need and donate it			0
and if you are feeling the squeeze of the economy as we head into the holidays , volunteer at a homeless shelter , food bank or soup kitchen			0
there is nothing like helping those who are less fortunate than you to make you feel grateful for what you do have , which will curb overbuying ( and overcooking ) and keep the holidays focused on what matters : the people in your life			0
and while it 's too late to change how much food you bought for this year , maybe next year this strategy will have you just buying slightly less			0
but this year , it will make us grateful for having leftovers at all , even if we do n't turn them all into a taquito .			0
