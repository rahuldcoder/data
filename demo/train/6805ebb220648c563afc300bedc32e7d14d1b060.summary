-- for the first time , newly released search warrant documents show why authorities began investigating former @entity5 star @entity4 as a possible suspect in an unsolved @entity8 double homicide in july 2012			1
the warrant and accompanying eight - page affidavit do not state whether @entity4 is believed to have been directly involved in the drive - by shooting , nor is there a suggested motive			1
but as @entity0 has previously reported , a grand jury has been looking into whether @entity4 played a role in the drive - by shooting , according to law enforcement sources			2
no charges have been filed and authorities have not commented publicly on the investigation			0
that 2012 shooting is separate from a 2013 killing in which @entity4 is charged and awaiting trial			1
@entity4 , 23 , was indicted for first - degree murder and weapons charges by a different grand jury in august , 2013 , in the shooting death of his friend @entity27			1
@entity4 has pleaded not guilty			2
the former @entity30 ' tight end was arrested in late june , 10 days after authorities say @entity27 , a 27 - year - old semi-pro football player , was killed in @entity31 , @entity32			1
the search warrant and affidavit reveal that an anonymous tipster contacted police days after @entity27 's execution - style shooting to talk about the separate drive - by shooting the previous year			1
a man who was identified as a security supervisor at a nightclub in @entity8 tipped off authorities that he " had knowledge the two incidents were related , " according to the newly released search warrant , which was executed in december			1
when a dispatcher asked how the tipster knew about two incidents that occurred nearly a year apart , the caller said , " someone accidentally spilled the beans on me , " according to the warrant 's affidavit , which did n't elaborate on that point			2
in the affidavit , a detective wrote that the man had " very specific details " about a suspicious vehicle with @entity61 license plates , and information about the date , time , and place of the 2012 double homicide			1
the man told detectives his source for the information was a patron of the nightclub who he knew as " b " or " @entity73 " the affidavit said that , before the tipster 's call , @entity8 detectives involved in the 2012 drive - by investigation were watching tv news reports when they heard that @entity4 was a possible suspect in @entity27 's murder			1
the detectives remembered seeing @entity4 on the nightclub 's surveillance video screened in july , 2012			1
these two disparate pieces of information prompted police to take a closer look at surveillance videos already examined , including those from another nightclub , called @entity90 , and a nearby parking garage , according to the court documents			0
judge seizes home of @entity4 after going back to the surveillance tapes , authorities recognized @entity4 driving a silver @entity97 into a parking garage just after midnight on july 16 , 2012 , the warrant states			1
about a half hour later , @entity4 is seen with another man later identified as @entity102 following the soon - to - be victims of the double homicide and two other men as they entered the nightclub @entity90 about midnight , the affidavit adds			1
ten minutes later , " after consuming two drinks , " @entity4 is seen leaving @entity90 with @entity102			2
at about 2:20 a.m. , a video reviewed by police showed the same silver suv looping around the block " at a very slow rate of speed " after the victims leave the club and enter a parking garage , the documents show			0
a short time later , police said , victims @entity120 and @entity121 , were fatally shot in a 2003 @entity122			0
two others in the car survived			0
there is no video of the shooting			0
one of the survivors told police that just before the gunfire , an suv was stopped next to them at a red light			0
according to the documents , another witness came forward on july 19 , 2012 , days after the double homicide			1
a man told police he and a friend saw a @entity138 or @entity97 suv with @entity61 plates pull next to his car , then run a red light the night of the double homicide			1
the driver was described as a " light - skinned @entity145 man with short hair , " the documents state			0
at the next intersection , the witness said , the same suv pulled next to a @entity122			0
then , according to the warrant , the witness heard six quick gunshots , pulled up to the @entity122 , and saw the wounded men inside			2
at the time , @entity8 police asked the public to be on the lookout for a light - colored or silver suv but were unable to locate the vehicle with @entity61 plates			2
that changed after @entity27 's murder when the focus on @entity4 as a possible suspect in @entity27 's death led police to his uncle 's home in @entity168 , @entity169			0
who was @entity27 inside the uncle 's garage , authorities discovered a silver @entity97 with @entity61 license plates , according to sources			0
as @entity0 has previously reported , law enforcement sources believe it is the same vehicle described in the unsolved double homicide in @entity8			1
the warrant confirms the vehicle is the same suv given to @entity4 by a dealership return for promoting its business			2
police have since recovered a .38 caliber handgun they 've identified as the murder weapon in the unsolved double homicide in @entity8			1
but police have not established a connection between the gun and @entity4			0
@entity4 hit with wrongful death suit @entity102 , the man identified by the document and law enforcement sources as being with @entity4 in the club the night of the double homicide , is suing @entity4 for allegedly shooting him in the face last year in @entity195 after they left a @entity198 strip club			1
according to law enforcement sources , @entity102 has testified before separate grand juries investigating the unsolved @entity8 homicides and @entity27 's murder			0
however , before @entity102 appeared before the grand juries , he was jailed in @entity169 because he failed to show up despite a subpoena			0
the new court documents state while in jail , @entity102 's calls were routinely recorded			0
according to the documents , when a correction 's officer listened to the conversations -- five of them in october , 2013 -- he heard @entity102 " discussing details of the @entity8 homicide investigation			2
" the affidavit does n't reveal who he was talking to or exactly what was said			0
@entity102 's attorney did not respond to a @entity0 call on thursday			0
he previously has declined to address any details about his client beyond acknowledging the lawsuit .			0
