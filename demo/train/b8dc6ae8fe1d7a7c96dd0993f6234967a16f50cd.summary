-- @entity2 's dismal start to the @entity4 season continued on saturday as the reigning champions slumped to a 1 - 0 against @entity6 at the @entity7			1
@entity9 international @entity8 scored the only goal of the game in the second minute to lift @entity6 to third in the table with eight points and leave @entity2 languishing in 10th with four -- their worst start to a season since 2001 - 02			1
@entity18 's attempts to get @entity2 back in level terms were thwarted by @entity20 in @entity6 's goal before the break and @entity24 's double substitution at halftime -- new signing @entity26 and @entity28 replacing @entity29 and @entity30 -- made little impact			1
" right now i have no team			0
we are a team without concentration			0
at halftime , i changed two players and wanted to change six , " @entity24 said			0
to make matters worse , arch rivals @entity37 recorded their fourth straight win of the season on saturday -- running out 4 - 1 winners against @entity42 -- to open up a gap of eight points over @entity2			1
@entity46 full - back @entity44 opened the scoring for @entity37 in the 32nd minute before @entity48 , who came on as a substitute in the 59th minute , bagged two goals in the final quarter of the match			2
the first came from the penalty spot in the 74th minute -- after @entity55 had been brought down by defender @entity56 -- before he side - footed a second goal four minutes later			0
@entity58 -- who also came on as a substitute -- rounded off a resounding win for @entity62 's men with a injury - time strike			1
the only downside was the early departure of @entity66 , who limped off in the 57th minute			0
" the most important thing is we have 12 points from 12 , we tried to control the game and we could have scored a few more			0
we 'll see tomorrow how long @entity66 will be out , it 's a problem , he gives us a lot of organisation at the back and is very important for us , " @entity62 said			2
in saturday 's other fixtures , @entity76 are up to second after beating @entity78 3 - 1 while @entity79 recorded their first win of the season with a 2 - 1 win against @entity83 .			2
