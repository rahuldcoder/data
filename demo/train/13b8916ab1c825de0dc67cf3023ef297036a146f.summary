last week , president @entity0 came to my country , @entity3			1
president @entity4 and our people received him with great pride , but it is unlikely @entity0 heard anything about our government 's plan to give a great chunk of land that has been the @entity15 tribe 's home for millennia , to a hunting company from the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
the hunters want this land to kill our lions and leopards and this deal will take away 40 % of our grasslands and forested mountains that we call home			2
it threatens the wildlife and the @entity15 's very existence			1
we want @entity0 and the international community to know our story and help stop our eviction			0

the @entity38 moved us 50 years ago from what is now the @entity41 park and subsequent governments have consistently restricted our grazing rights			0
a large amount of land next to our community near the @entity41 has already been handed to the hunters from the @entity18			2
we often see @entity49 royalty arriving in their jumbo jets and then driving around in jeeps shooting anything they see moving and they keep wanting more			0
the government uses our faces on tourism posters and brochures for @entity3 , yet president @entity4 has said that our way of life is a thing of the past and we should live in the modern world			1
but without our land and our traditions , what are we ? most people in @entity69 raise cows and goats to pay for food and education for our children			1
without grazing lands , many @entity15 men have felt pressured to move to the city to take jobs as security guards			2
the women are left behind to raise our children and grandchildren and despite their hardship they are fighting to preserve our way of life			0

thousands of our men , women and children have traveled for days to meet government officials to state our case			2
three hundred @entity15 women marched on the capital @entity97 to protest , and in may , all of our community elders camped outside the prime minister 's office in the capital for three weeks , demanding the @entity18 deal be abandoned			2
we are sure our brothers and sisters across the world can help			0
after we started an international campaign with @entity109 more than 1.7 million people around the world joined our cause			1
today we are at home in our lands but fear that tens of thousands of villagers in our community could soon be evicted			0
a commitment from @entity4 can easily save us from the terrible fate that has befallen so many great tribes of the world			0
we know that the battle for our lands will not be easy , but as long as the government knows that the world is watching we will be safe			0
with that kind of attention , we have hope that our ancient way of life on our traditional lands will yet survive in the 21st century .			0
