-- it 's almost unfathomable to believe that @entity2 could n't have seen this coming			1
earlier this week , in an open letter to @entity7 , the @entity5 singer - songwriter offered the lately controversial pop star such tough - love advice as " you do n't need to let the music business make a prostitute of you " and " they 're there for the money ... " and " kindly fire any --- who has n't expressed alarm , because they do n't care about you			1
" @entity19 has certainly seemed to ask for such admonition -- and warning			2
in recent weeks , she 's shocked the world with antics that have included a seamy , hypersexual awards show performance , a music video in which she swings around naked on demolition equipment and licks sledgehammers , and a @entity33 photo session in which she 's depicted smoking blunts and violating herself with a red bodysuit			0
she has officially , and unfortunately , ushered the word " twerking " into the vernacular			0
in return , she 's been called " crude , " " a hot mess , " and a lot worse			0
she 's also gotten immense attention , which is , of course , the point of all of this			0
when in a recent @entity51 interview @entity19 said that @entity2 's 1990 video for " @entity52 " helped inspire her own video for her new single , " @entity49 , " @entity2 , it seems , saw an opening			1
she swiftly posted a 1,000 - word letter to her website and @entity58 page , issued , she claimed , " in the spirit of motherliness and love " and telling the younger musician why and how she should value her body , which is " for you and your boyfriend " and not the music honchos who " will be sunning themselves on their yachts in @entity70 , which they bought by selling your body			1
" but by choosing to hand down her advice in such a public forum , @entity2 effectively proved that the aspiring yacht owners are n't the only ones out to get something from @entity19			1
she easily could have sent @entity19 a private letter			1
instead , @entity2 chose to initiate a very public shaming			2
that , of course , provoked an aggressive response , igniting a woman - on - woman battle likely as damaging to young female onlookers as @entity2 's condemnation of @entity19 ' self - exploitation			1
once again , we have women beating down on other women			0
a near - teenager under attack , @entity19 responded like any near - teenager under attack might : instantly and cruelly			1
she compared @entity2 to troubled actress @entity95 , tweeting a screen shot of messages @entity2 had posted to @entity98 two years ago about her own emotional health			2
then she said she was too busy to get into it with @entity2 , because she had a " @entity102 " gig to prep for			2
@entity2 's sympathy for @entity19 , a " victim " in her eyes only hours earlier , immediately turned far less understanding as she threatened legal action if @entity19 did n't apologize and remove the tweets			1
she then mocked @entity19 in an objectifying way that was particularly ironic given such missives in her original note as " you are worth more than your body or your sexual appeal " and " women are to be valued for so much more than their sexuality			0
" she wrote that @entity19 " can take five minutes today between g - string ( effing ) changes to publicly apologize			2
" that 's not to say @entity2 does n't have a point -- or a good one			1
she has called for a public discussion of how male executives at record labels manage young female stars and whether their decisions are always or ever in a star 's best interest			0
after all , who is looking out for @entity7 ? certainly not her parents and certainly not the men from her record company , who are making a ton of money off of her			0
@entity134 , best known for guiding the career of @entity136 , is heading @entity19 , surely he must know there can be a price to pay when the act overshadows the talent			0
there is a shelf life on outrageous behavior , as so many young stars have found out who came before @entity7			0
so , one might give @entity2 the benefit of doubt			0
she was concerned for @entity19 and thought , somehow , that insulting her in a public forum was the quickest and most direct way to reach her			0
but by assuming that @entity19 is n't in charge -- or , more poignantly , suggesting to @entity19 that she was n't in charge -- and by inviting a global audience to sit in on the belittling , @entity2 was very carefully and specifically asking for a fight			1
and a fight she got			0
the letter could have been the best and most honest advice @entity19 has ever received , but delivery -- and intention -- matters			1
and @entity2 was n't in it just for @entity19 , now was she ? for fans of @entity19 , the best bet is to focus on the music			1
@entity19 might not be role model material at the moment , but if you do n't look to her for more than catchy tunes , there 's less chance that she 'll disappoint			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			0

@entity2 posted an open letter to @entity7 telling her she 's a victim
@entity173 : @entity2 could have told @entity19 privately
she says now we have a woman - on - woman battle
@entity173 : @entity2 makes good points , but delivery and intention matter
