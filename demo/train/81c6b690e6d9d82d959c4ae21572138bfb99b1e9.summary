parents are usually the first to show off pictures of their kids , but that role has been reversed in a new breed of style blogs in which children submit nostalgic and stylish photos of their parents from back in the day			1
blogs like my @entity17 , the @entity19 , my parents were @entity21 and dads in short shorts allow proud children to submit nostalgic pictures of their parents to put on display for the world			1
" similar to the way that young people look to celebrities as style icons , more people are looking to these attainable vintage fashions from their parents and there is a growing population of people who prefer these classic looks , " said @entity28 , editor of the trend forecasting newsletter @entity30			2
what is so unique about these blogs is that the photos celebrate just how cool today 's offspring think their parents are			1

during a recession , folks are more likely to indulge in the kind of nostalgia these old pictures evoke			2
" @entity89 of uncertainty make you long for the past , and the nostalgia of these pictures makes people feel safe , " said @entity85 , editor - in - chief of @entity87 and @entity88 magazines			2
" and a bit of nostalgia is inspirational in fashion these days , because it seems more affordable			2
" the web site dads in @entity23 , started by marketing manager @entity99 , 26 , and painter @entity100 , 26 , has a genesis similar to my @entity17 , the @entity19			1
" on a summer road trip we were looking through an old photo album and discovered a shot of a dad in bright yellow shorts mixed in with seemingly normal family photos , " @entity99 said			1
" the mom claimed the shot was an ' accident ' and that she was just ' testing the camera			0
' upon further investigation , we noticed a lot of our friends had similar ' accidents ' in their old photo albums , and thus the blog was born			1
" dads in @entity23 has had more the 50 submissions of dads wearing above the knee pants , with more pouring in every day			2
how do parents feel about being exposed in all their youthful glory and occasional fashion disasters on the internet for all to see ? " the blog is great fun for me and the nostalgia is a trip , " said @entity128 about her debut on my @entity17 , the @entity19			1
