when it comes to energy , @entity2 , a @entity12 state senator , and @entity1 , a @entity14 congressman , both have controversial positions to defend to voters			1
@entity2 elaborated on her position to shutter the @entity18 , a move that critics say will make @entity5 more polluted			1

" @entity1 accused his @entity12 opponent of not wanting to ensure the cleanliness of the country 's air and water			1
@entity1 himself was put on the defensive when he was asked why he had switched his position from supporting the construction of the @entity22 to opposing it			1
" when the pipeline was first proposed and we were first asked to vote on it , a lot of promises were made about what was going to happen with the oil produced in that pipeline and the jobs it created , " @entity1 said			1
" but the more i looked into it and the more i talked to @entity23 , there was no guarantee that the oil produced and sent through that pipeline was going to stay in the @entity55 and benefit @entity55 consumers			0
and there was no guarantee that a lot of jobs would be create for @entity23			0
" the pipeline , which has yet to receive federal approval , would not run through @entity5 , although the @entity62 of @entity5 strongly supports the measure as a part of their platform			2
at the center of the energy debate , the candidates swapped jabs about another kind of green : special interest dollars			2
@entity1 accused @entity2 of favoring the interests of the oil industry over those of the alternate energy because she is backed by oil money			1
@entity2 said the @entity18 overreached when the federal agency sent workers to @entity5 to manage the water supply of agriculture producers , and accused @entity1 of supporting the agency because he is backed by wealthy environmentalists			1
the two candidates displayed a smaller gap in positions when it came to foreign policy			0
both expressed concern over vetting and arming @entity94 rebels to fight @entity95 there			0
@entity2 and @entity1 's parties differ greatly on immigration , but in this @entity100 race , the difference was a matter of degrees			1
the @entity12 said she is opposed to amnesty for undocumented immigrants already in the country but would not vote to repeal an @entity108 administration program that grants relief to some youths who were brought illegally into the country as children			0
@entity1 went a step further , saying that the @entity114 , as the program is known , is working well for @entity23			2
" i 've talked to young people in @entity5 who are using it ... and i 've seen what it 's done to give them hope and opportunities to get a job and make a better future for themselves and their families , " he said			0
for much of the election , @entity1 has tried to shake his white collar image , after he made comments suggesting that sen. @entity129 was merely " a farmer with no law degree			2
" @entity2 capitalized on that gaffe last night			2
" i am a young woman who grew up on a southwest @entity5 farm drinking well water			0
my father is a farmer , and our farmers are some of the best conservationists out there			0
" but @entity1 bit back			2
" that 's why my ancestors came from @entity141 during the potato family , settled across the river in @entity144 to start a better life for themselves			0
than they moved to @entity5 to start a farm			0
my great - great - grandfather died breaking that prairie			0
" on debate night , a new @entity151 poll showed the candidates in a dead heat			0
