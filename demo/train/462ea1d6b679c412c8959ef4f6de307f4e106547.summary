editor 's note : @entity2 is host of the @entity4 show , " issues with @entity2 , " a topical event - driven show with a wide range of viewpoints			1
@entity2 is the author of " secrets can be murder : what @entity12 's @entity11			1
" @entity2 says tougher penalties are needed to keep sex offenders from committing more crimes			1
@entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- early last month , beautiful 25 - year - old @entity19 went missing			1
her family holds out hope she is still alive			1
an aspiring dancer from @entity24 , @entity22 moved to @entity17 to pursue her career			1
on december 2nd , she went to the posh @entity28 nightclub @entity26 to blow off some steam with her friend			2
security video shows @entity22 leaving the club with convicted sex offender @entity33 , according to the @entity34			1
@entity34 officials confirmed that @entity33 then drove @entity22 about an hour away toward his apartment			2
@entity22 was reported missing the next day			2
@entity17 state police searched @entity33 's apartment and court documents indicate officers observed apparent bite marks on @entity33 's hand and scratches on his back and shoulder			2
according to court records and state police , large pieces of carpet were missing from his apartment and days later , carpet pieces that seemed to match @entity33 's were found on the side of a nearby road			2
search parties have been combing roads , woods , and swampland , and police divers searched for clues in a nearby lake , but the search has gone cold in recent weeks			2
@entity33 is in jail for violating probation and is a suspect , but he has not been charged in @entity22 's disappearance , according to state police			2
@entity19 is still missing more than a month later			2
her family has joined search efforts in @entity17 and prays they will find her alive , but police are treating the case as a homicide			2
the worst part about this tragic story ? it may have been preventable			0
@entity19 had no idea she was leaving that club with a sex offender			1
after all , most of them look pretty normal			0
few fit the @entity78 stereotype of the creepy guy wearing a trench coat and driving a white van			0
@entity19 may have been unaware who she was with that night , but the legal system certainly knew him			0
@entity33 previously pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault , including one count of masturbating in front of two women			0
and he was violating probation			0
and he had an outstanding warrant for allegedly exposing himself to a woman in a mall parking lot			0
@entity33 has n't been convicted of anything in this case or charged in @entity22 's disappearance , but even if he is innocent , the larger question of how the criminal justice system deals with sex offenders remains a vital issue			1
in a sane world , @entity33 is not a free man on that night , able to allegedly target @entity19			0
but we do n't live in a sane world			0
we live in a world where sexual assault is business as usual			0
where 's the outrage ? the @entity22 case is a microcosm of a societal problem			0
as a nation , we must realize there is no such thing as a " minor " sexual offense -- because sex offenders often start small and graduate to more serious crimes			1
according to a 2003 @entity122 study , 78 percent of imprisoned sex offenders had prior arrests and 28 percent had prior arrests for sex crimes			1
according to the same study , one quarter of men serving time for rape and 19 percent of those serving time for sexual assault had been on probation or parole at the time of the offense that landed them in prison			0
sex offenders start off by nabbing the easy prey -- committing the so - called " minor " sexual offenses like flashing random women , or the crimes @entity33 committed			1
then , after getting away with it or receiving a slap on the wrist , they become hungrier and develop into full - fledged predators			0
and it 's only when they sink their teeth into their prey that the legal system finally brings down the hammer			0
but it 's too late			0
to stop this progression , we must start treating all sexual offenses as major crimes			1
in the same @entity122 study , on average , the sex offenders served less than half of their sentences			1
so basically that means @entity164 served more of her sentence than the average person convicted of a sex crime does			1
i 'm glad our justice system has its priorities straight			0
the simple answer is to take all sex offenders off the streets , from the moment they commit the first " minor " offense			1
i 'm not just talking about putting them behind bars			0
we need to rehabilitate these predators at the earliest stage possible , before their behavior worsens			0
and if the prisons are too crowded to hold them , how about releasing some of the nonviolent drug offenders to make some room ? they ca n't be worse than sex offenders on the prowl who , compared with non-sex offenders released from prison , are four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime , according to a government study			1
this problem is out in the open			0
but how many @entity200 will it take to before politicians and judges see it and are willing to do something about it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : sex offenders are often let out on the street too soon
victims *pay* the price for *inadequate* *punishment* and rehabilitation , she says
@entity2 says we must treat all sex offenses as serious crimes
