he 's broken every record in the book and won a glut of @entity4 and world titles , but even at the age of 40 , @entity6 has no intention of resting on his laurels			1
" a day without running is not a good day , " the @entity11 athletics legend told @entity12 's @entity13			1
" running , you continue until you die			1
" which spells bad news for his fellow competitors , although @entity6 does acknowledge he will have to call it quits at some stage			1
" competition stops somewhere , but when i do n't know , " he says			2
" what i 'm thinking now , is that i want to break all the @entity25 records -- over 40 , over 50 , over 60			1
" i do n't know how long i 'm going to live after this , but i hope the next 100 years ! " he adds , breaking into his trademark grin			2
" the smiling assassin " -- as he was once famously dubbed -- has been dispatching his opponents with ruthless efficiency for over two decades and is hugely popular wherever he runs , not least among his dedicated following of @entity11 fans bedecked in their country 's green , yellow and red			1
" @entity6 , @entity6 " will be the chant as their hero winds up the pace before unleashing his trademark blistering finish to leave rivals trailing			1
his longtime @entity43 manager @entity42 summed it up perfectly : " his smile makes athletics smile			2
" throughout his glittering career stretching over two decades , @entity6 has proved an impeccable ambassador for track and field			1
despite increasing business commitments , he is finding time to pass on that experience to pass on to the next generation -- acting as a mentor for 14 young athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds for the @entity58 4teen program ahead of the @entity59			1
those youngsters , who came from around the world , would do well to heed his renowned sportsmanship , because win or lose it was always with that smile on his face			2
" of course there is disappointment when you lose a race , " he told @entity12			2
" for me , it 's in my character , maybe i can say good character			2
" glittering career disappointments have proved few and far between since his first competitive race at the age of 14 and while still in his teens he captured a 5,000/10,000 meters double at the world junior championships in @entity80			2
the next year in 1993 saw @entity6 's senior breakthrough as he claimed the first of four straight 10,000m world championship titles after a battle royal with @entity86 @entity85 in @entity87			1
his world - record - breaking spree started in 1994 , covering distances from 2,000m on an indoor track to the full 42 km of the marathon			1
watch : the best long distance runner ever ? @entity6 rates his 5,000m performance at the weltklasse meeting in @entity95 in 1995 as his " most memorable achievement " -- he smashed the record of @entity86 's @entity98 by nearly 11 seconds with a time of 12 minutes 44.39 seconds			1
" that was amazing , " he said			0
metronomically lapping the 400m track at just over four - minute mile pace for over three miles , he says that as he ran the beat of the 1995 hit song " @entity108 ( @entity107 - @entity106 - @entity105 ) " kept ringing around his head			2
" it 's nice music , if 's fast written , that 's why i could break a world record , by that music , " he recalls			2
" i 'm a @entity108 ! @entity115 and then you know the timing and at the same time your style changes immediately			0
" @entity4 gold @entity6 won his first @entity4 gold at @entity122 ' 96 over his favored 10,000m distance , just edging out his arch - rival @entity124			1
four years later , in @entity125 , he became only the third man in history to retain that title -- the @entity86 again the victim			0
" i won that race nine - hundredths of a second from @entity124			1
that was really the one still i love to watch			0
it was a very special moment			0
" by the time the @entity135 came around , the balance of power had shifted to his compatriot @entity136 , and @entity137 came fifth as he missed out on a hat - trick , but by then he had already turned to road running and marathons			1
@entity4 gold over the classic distance has eluded him ; he decided against competing in the marathon in @entity144 in 2008 because of the air quality , and was controversially left out of the @entity11 team for the @entity147 last year			1
but over distances from 10 km through half - marathon and the full marathon , the records have tumbled			1
successive wins in the @entity154 marathon in 2007 and 2008 each came with world bests , the second of two hours three minutes and 59 seconds -- the first man under the two hours four minute mark			2
@entity108 rhythm for the longer distances , he says the @entity162 tune is replaced by the need to set the perfect pace and to keep a close eye on the opposition , often years younger			0
" you are just thinking about your race			0
who is next to you , who is behind you , who 's in the race , how fast does he run , what is the way breathes , " he reveals			0
" when you run a marathon especially , the first 15k they 're perfect , but the things happen after 20k			0
you can look and see , ' oh this guy , now he 's getting tired , ' so it 's easy to beat him			0
" years of disciplined training , getting up at 5 a.m. each morning , have left @entity6 a battle - hardened veteran and have helped him in his life outside of track and field			1
watch : @entity6 dominates @entity186 marathon two grueling training sessions are interspersed by a day spent in his office -- he employs over 500 people in range of enterprises based right across @entity11			1
he is usually in bed by 10 p.m. after spending time with his wife and family -- he has a son and three daughters			0
@entity6 certainly knew the value of hard work from his formative years , growing up in humble surroundings in the town of @entity201 in @entity202 , living nearly 2,500m above sea level			1
one of 10 children , he used to run several kilometers each day to school and back to his family 's small farm			0
early inspiration inspired from an early age by the 5,000/10,000 @entity4 double of great @entity11 runner @entity212 " @entity215 " yifter in the 1980 @entity214 -- " i was dreaming to be like him " -- @entity6 acknowledges that his environment was the perfect platform			1
" we live at altitude , we were born in altitude , " he says			0
" going to school , helping our parents , fetching water from the river			0
my training started when i was two			0
it was part of my life			0
" but @entity6 is concerned that the neverending trail of talent from his country , characterized by the likes of @entity136 and women 's champion @entity232 , could be under threat from increased affluence -- welcome though that is in a country which has suffered so much			1
" life is changing a little bit			0
that 's why it 's very difficult to produce more long - distance runners from @entity11 , " he says			1
" the more good things you have , the less athletes you have			2
you do n't see so much athletes from @entity246 ( the capital )			2
you do n't see so much athletes from the city , most of our athletes they come from the countryside			2
" with his ambassadorial work , @entity6 is doing his best to make sure the conveyor belt of champions continues for a while yet			1
role model " it 's important to inspire people			0
without a role model it 's not an easy job , " he says			0
" i 'm teaching everybody how they become successful			0
one is to be disciplined			0
second , commitment or a goal , and third is hard work			0
" he has one key message to his youngsters and the wider public : " win for yourself			0
" " what is that ? sometimes you know people promise to stop smoking , to stop drinking , to stop taking drugs			0
but they , after one day or after two days , they can not , which means they 've lost for themselves			0
" i ask people win themselves first , which means you can win anything that you dream , that you plan , what you want			0
this really is my tip for everyone			0
" @entity290 to his incredible talent and will to win , @entity6 has certainly " won for himself " in bundles down the years -- dominating distance running and becoming one of the most recognizable sportsman on the planet			1
judging by his recent performances -- winner of april 's @entity300 half - marathon , third in a world - class @entity301 10 km last month and smashing the best for a 40 - year - old at the distance -- @entity6 will be delighting his fans for a few more years to come as he sticks to his endearing philosophy for life .			1
