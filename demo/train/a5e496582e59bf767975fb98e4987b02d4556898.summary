when the community organizer walks down her block in @entity6 's @entity5 neighborhood , she is reminded of the officer who was shot there			0
violence even surrounded her high school			1
shots constantly rang out around the streets by the school building			0
her junior year , a police car crashed right in front of her class			0
" the violence is something we deal with daily and it 's a real struggle , " @entity17 said			1
" you get scared and youth here are angry when their friends are shot			0
the violence really does something to a person			1
" " it 's sometimes bigger than the crime itself , " @entity17 said			0
" it affects you more , maybe even more than the person injured , because it lingers			0
" studies show her experience is shared by thousands of @entity39 who live in tough urban areas			1
a growing number of programs treat post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity44 ) in war veterans			1
but far fewer treat @entity39 who suffer from the ptsd that comes with their zip code			1
and this kind of @entity44 may be affecting even more people			1
@entity44 can directly hurt a person 's brain by messing with the amygdala -- the part of the brain that triggers a chemical to release to help you decide between " @entity56 " in a threatening situation			1
if someone is exposed to prolonged , repetitive , or extreme trauma , the amygdala stays in alert mode			0
and the neurons , the pathways to this part of the brain , lose their ability to recover			1
a person 's memory becomes corrupted like a bad computer hard drive and it can hurt a person 's ability to separate out new experiences and determine whether they are safe or dangerous			1
the longer a person stays in the hyper - vigilant mode , the greater the chance of permanent damage			0
in a child , damage can be magnified and lead to problems like dissociative identity disorder			0
@entity6 anti-violence program did n't do much , audit finds a recent study that ran in the @entity83 found that you do n't even need a direct experience of a violent crime to be hurt by it			1
when there is a perception that there is disorder in a particular neighborhood , it causes some residents to suffer from @entity44			1
while the overall rate of violent crime has gone down in the @entity39 -- so much that some sociologists call this the era of the " @entity99 " -- there are still pockets where violent crime is so concentrated that neighbors ca n't escape it			0
after interviewing some 8,000 people in @entity111 , @entity106 professor of psychiatry dr. @entity107 and his colleagues say that they are seeing evidence of higher rates of ptsd in this urban population than in war veterans			1
this is -- well , it is not an epidemic of violence , that is not the right term for this			1
this is a pandemic , " @entity107 said			0
an epidemic is concentrated in a particular region			0
a pandemic is spread over a wider geographic area and impacts a much larger population			0
" we are seeing the same ( high instances of ptsd ) in cities like @entity134 and @entity6 and @entity135 " in surveying patients picked at random from @entity111 's @entity137 -- one of the busiest @entity140 trauma centers in the @entity39 -- @entity107 and his team found that at least half knew someone who had been murdered			1
some two - thirds said they had been victims of a violent assault			0
a third had been sexually assaulted			0
this wide range of trauma experience meant that 32 % of this population suffered ptsd symptoms			1
in continuing these surveys , the team wants a better scientific understanding about the lasting consequences of living in violent neighborhoods , @entity107 said			1
" we find you do n't only lose a generation to this violence , " in terms of the people who are directly hurt , he said			1
instead , " you are losing multiple generations ( to the violence ) in these war - torn inner cities			1
" " with pandemic levels of disorder there are serious consequences , " @entity107 says			0
the violence " makes it harder for kids to go through school or to play by the rules			1
it makes it harder for a parent to get a job or avoid addiction to drugs			0
" community leaders often talk about education being key to lifting people from poverty , but @entity107 believes that wo n't be enough			0
" it is important to have programs like @entity187 to help begin to break the cycle of poverty with education , but if we are not doing something for people 's mental health , we may not be able to change this cycle , " @entity107 said			1
the chances that young men who experience trauma in their neighborhood will end up in jail are astronomically high , studies show			1
studies have also shown a high correlation between neighborhood disorder and physical abuse			2
there are further cognitive consequences as well			2
a study by @entity208 , a @entity209 sociology professor , found that some neighborhoods in @entity6 have seen high violent crime rates for decades			2
frequent violence has dramatically limited academic achievement in these neighborhoods			2
exposure to violence is associated with cognitive and emotional stress that can lead to reductions in working memory			1
another study looking at local violence in @entity6 found that children who lived within 1,500 feet of a homicide had lower verbal and impulse control scores a week after the incident happened			1
tests of older students showed similar results			0
she survived a standoff with a gunman -- could you ? this concept that " deteriorated " neighborhoods have an impact on one 's mental health is not new			0
at least 70 years ago , @entity6 school researchers @entity238 and @entity240 went through 30,000 psychiatric hospital admission records			0
they found high rates of substance abuse and even schizophrenia in these neighborhoods			2
later studies found that high rates of depression were also common			1
one compounding problem is that there is an overall element of mistrust in rougher neighborhoods , studies show			1
people feel powerless to change their overall circumstances ; therefore , ptsd -- which carries symptoms of hyper - vigilance , social separation and avoidance -- may amplify that mistrust			2
in an absence of a national public policy to address this serious problem , there are a handful of nonprofits that have overcome some of that neighborhood mistrust			0
@entity270 , one of those nonprofits , takes a public health approach to violence prevention			2
epidemiologist dr. @entity270 started the program after returning from @entity276 , where he had been fighting tuberculosis and @entity279 epidemics			0
when he returned to @entity6 , he saw similar patterns in outbreaks of violence and thought an epidemiological approach may stop it			2
@entity270 concentrates its efforts on those who are at highest risk to cause violence			2
workers living in the tougher @entity6 neighborhoods listen for trouble			2
when they hear rumblings about a fight brewing , they intervene , talk to involved parties and try to mediate the problem before it escalates into violence			2
they also work with at - risk individuals to develop a plan to reject violence , whether that be through anger management , job training or substance abuse programs			1
" if we can stop the violence and stop people 's exposure to the violence early , we reduce its impact from spreading through the community , " said @entity307 , @entity270 spokesman			2
@entity17 , meanwhile , is turning her experience growing up in a tough neighborhood into motivation to organize it			0
she 's led highly visible protests to raise awareness of the consequences of violence			2
" i always believe in hope , and i feel as an organizer that we 've got to reinvest in these communities so that more of us wo n't have to continue to live this way , " @entity17 said			0
mother loses both sons in 19 days to gun violence @entity107 hopes there will be some kind of public policy initiative to address the consequences of violence before it is too late			2
" by having a lifetime of trauma baggage and coming from multiple generations with trauma baggage , this is hard to overcome without help , " @entity107 said			0
there will be trouble , he said , " if we do n't start paying attention soon			0
" more from the series : how you make moral judgments this is your brain on knitting			0

an @entity111 survey found half of *respondents* knew someone who had been murdered
a number of programs treat veterans ' ptsd , but few help urban @entity44
urban violence reduces cognitive ability in those living near it , studies show
