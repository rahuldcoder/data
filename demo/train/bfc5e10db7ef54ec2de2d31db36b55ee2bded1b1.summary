-- so , where 'd everybody go ? baseball 's @entity4 ' attendance is down 8,290 per home game from a year ago			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , each down more than 4,000			2
@entity9 , more than 3,000			2
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , 2,000 - plus			1
@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 ...			2
down , down , down , down , down , down , down , down			2
like they say , come on out , good seats still available ! as baseball 's yearly @entity26 gets under way tuesday night in @entity29 , we will be bombarded with a lot of talk about what a great young star this guy is , or that guy is			1
" you 'll be hearing a lot about this guy			0
" " this kid 's going to be around a long , long time			0
" " he 's got ' future @entity40 ' written all over him			0
" of course we will			0
never mind all the one - season wonders			1
the flashes in the pans			0
the golden boys who turned to rust			0
the @entity46 who were barely seen or heard from again			0
it 's a frat party and everybody 's up for it			0
@entity50 has never been better -- at least that 's what somebody will tell you and sell you			1
seventeen of the game 's 30 teams have poorer attendance than a year ago at this time			1
@entity60 television ratings get more disappointing year after year			0
household - name players -- i mean popular and scandal - free ones like @entity65 and @entity66 -- have come to the ends of their careers , with no clear heir - apparents			1
is there a star player of today you 'd go out of your way to see ? " hey , @entity74 is in town ! " " you wan na go to the ballpark tonight and see @entity78 ? " those are your all - star starting pitchers			1
would you recognize either one if you saw him coming toward you on the street ? @entity50 is losing its luster			1
as ticket prices get higher , interest goes lower			1
as options on television expand , baseball 's grip on the @entity89 public gets ever more slippery			0
tv 's audience for game 1 of the @entity95 between the @entity96 and @entity97 came to approximately 25.4 million viewers			1
when the same two teams met in the @entity60 last october , game 1 's viewership was pegged at around 15 million			1
one year earlier a series between the @entity103 and @entity10 attracted the worst tv ratings of any @entity60 in the past 30 years			0
players of great prowess and promise do still come along			1
a kid can capture imaginations in the blink of an eye			0
they also can vanish from the radar just as quickly			0
@entity122 now seems two - thirds the superstar he used to be			2
prince @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 ... not exactly the game 's hottest names anymore			2
was n't he the pitcher we were all waiting for ? we 're still waiting			2
@entity133 do not come along every day			0
oh , he is n't nearly as famous nationwide as @entity134 think he is			1
you could go months in @entity136 or @entity137 or @entity138 without meeting a soul who cares that this is @entity66 's last season , let alone anyone who could tell you who " the captain " is			1
yet he is a rarity in baseball indeed , particularly in this era -- a standout from beginning to end , as well as a guy who never gave us cause to question what kind of guy he secretly must be			0
he 's been about as controversial as a @entity153			0
@entity50 could use more like him			1
they had better show themselves soon , too , because fewer and fewer people are watching			2
you 'll hear somebody tonight call it the national pastime , but let me assure you of something : this nation can find other ways to pass the time .			0

@entity167 : attendance at @entity50 games is way down for many teams
he says all - star game tuesday held against *backdrop* of waning interest , *dearth* of big stars
he says players of prowess come along , but with fewer viewers , they do n't get famous
@entity167 : players like @entity66 do n't come along . we need more of them
