-- the @entity2 government has barred the country 's airlines from complying with a @entity6 charge on carbon emissions , escalating a dispute that officials have warned could turn into a trade war			1
@entity2 airlines had previously said they would not pay the @entity6 carbon tax , but the formal prohibition by the @entity14 , or cabinet , puts @entity16 in direct opposition to @entity18			1
the announcement , published on monday by @entity20 , the official news agency , comes a week before @entity2 and @entity22 leaders are to meet at a summit and just days after @entity24 , @entity2 's premier , said @entity16 was looking to provide more financial support to help @entity22 out of its debt mess			2
the @entity28 has notified all @entity2 airlines that , without government approval , they can not join the @entity6 emissions trading scheme or charge customers extra because of it , @entity20 said			1
the impact on @entity2 airlines with routes to @entity22 was unclear			1
although the @entity6 's carbon scheme went into effect for airlines on january 1 , @entity18 has not started charging them yet			1
but all airlines using @entity6 airports have been brought into the scheme			2
those that do not comply face fines while persistent offenders could be banned from @entity6 airports			0
" @entity2 hopes that @entity22 will directly address our concerns , in light of the overall situation of global climate change , the sustainable development of international aviation and @entity2 - @entity22 relations , " the @entity2 aviation authority said			0
it also said the @entity6 should adopt a " practical and constructive attitude " to come up with a solution that would be acceptable to both sides			0
it added what appeared to be a veiled threat : " @entity2 will consider additional measures to protect the interests of our citizens and our companies "			0
the @entity2 @entity66 , an industry group , said last year that @entity16 might sue the @entity6 over its carbon plan			1
but the prospect of a legal battle dimmed after the @entity70 ruled against a challenge brought by @entity73 airlines , saying the carbon trading scheme did not infringe on the sovereignty of other nations			0
although the aviation industry only accounts for about 3 per cent of global carbon emissions , its share is growing quickly and the @entity6 believes its carbon trading scheme is an important part of the fight against climate change			2
@entity2 state media have called it a " trade barrier in the name of environmental protection " and the foreign ministry has upbraided the @entity6 for its " unilateral " imposition of the carbon scheme			2
when @entity93 chancellor @entity92 visited @entity16 last week , @entity24 said @entity2 might contribute more to rescue funds that are aimed at resolving the @entity22 debt crisis			0
premier @entity24 is scheduled to meet @entity97 © @entity96 , @entity99 president , and other @entity22 leaders at a bilateral business summit next week in @entity16 .			0
