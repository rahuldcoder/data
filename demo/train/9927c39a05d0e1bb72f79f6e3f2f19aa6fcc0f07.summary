@entity0 , @entity1 -- vice president @entity3 has lashed out at @entity1 prime minister @entity4 , predicting that @entity1 could soon return to widespread sectarian violence that could require the return of @entity8 forces			1
" @entity4 is pushing my country to reach a turning point with deeply sectarian dimension , " the @entity10 vice president told @entity2 on sunday during an interview in the semiautonomous @entity13 region in the north , where he has fled so that government forces loyal to the @entity17 prime minister can not execute an arrest warrant for him on charges of running a death squad			1
he expressed concern that @entity8 " will face the same problem as they faced in 2003 , " when a @entity8 - led coalition invaded @entity1 , toppling the regime of @entity29 and unleashing a wave of sectarian violence			1
and he said he did not understand how @entity8 president @entity31 is able to characterize @entity1 as a free , stable and democratic country			1
" what sort of @entity1 we are talking about ? " he asked			1
" how the @entity8 will feel proud ? how the @entity8 administration is going to justify to the taxpayer the billion of dollars that has been spent and at the end of the day the @entity8 saying , ' sorry , we have no leverage even to put things in order in @entity1 ' ? " though @entity1 's instability may not affect this year 's election campaign in the @entity8 , " it is going to affect the @entity8 interest in the region , and they should be very much concern about that , " @entity3 said			1

he accused @entity4 of having " put my home and my office under siege " during the three months before he fled to the @entity71 resort about 400 km ( 250 miles ) north of @entity72			1
" i kept patient on that , hoping that @entity4 is going to behave sensibly sometime , and things aggravated , " @entity3 said			1
asked whether @entity4 is becoming a dictator , @entity3 was blunt : " what sort of explanation could i give for a real and serious power consolidation ? " he asked			1
" what could the average @entity1 people or the @entity8 citizen ... say for the prime minister to be chief in command , the minister of defense , the minister of interior and the chief of the national security ? " the charges appear to have been based on the confessions of three security guards for @entity3			1
