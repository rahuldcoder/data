@entity1 gov. @entity0 on monday stood by his criticism of so - called " no - go " zones in @entity5 , where sovereign nations allegedly cede authority to @entity9 immigrants , a controversial idea that many critics say is overblown			1
and the potential 2016 @entity13 presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants ' insistence on " non-assimilation , the fact that " you 've got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values , " which he called " dangerous			0
" @entity0 has the reputation of policy wonk among @entity13 and boldly told @entity13 officials during a 2013 address to the @entity30 that they " must stop being the stupid party " and needed to " stop insulting the intelligence of voters			1
" asked by @entity2 's @entity34 whether he would walk back his comments on no - go zones , made in a speech to the @entity38 in @entity39 earlier that day , @entity0 said , " not at all			1
" @entity41 guest wo n't apologize for @entity43 remark " and i 'm also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical @entity50 is a grave threat , we need @entity9 leaders to denounce the individuals , not just the acts of violence , " he said , adding that " it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation " of immigrants in the @entity47			1
but pressed for specific examples of such no - go zones , @entity0 demurred , saying he had met with " elected officials and others " to discuss them and noted a report in @entity63 tabloid the @entity62 that purported to highlight the challenges facing law enforcement in such areas			1
" i knew by speaking the truth we were gon na make people upset , " @entity0 told @entity34			1
@entity0 was also unable to offer examples during an earlier interview with @entity2 's @entity72 , saying that he 's " heard from folks here that there are neighborhoods where women do n't feel comfortable going in without veils ... we all know that there are neighborhoods where police are less likely to go into			1
" " i think that the radical @entity81 absolutely wants to pretend like this problem is not here			0
pretending it 's not here wo n't make it go away , " he told @entity72			0
pressed for details , @entity0 said only , " i think your viewers know absolutely there are places where the police are less likely to go			2
" and asked whether that feeling may be caused by high crime rates , rather than the @entity9 population in the area , @entity0 said , " this is n't a question			1
" " i know the @entity81 wants to make this into an attack on religion and that 's not what this is			0
what we are saying , it 's absolutely an issue for the @entity63 , absolutely is an issue for @entity47 and other @entity5 and @entity108 nations , " he said			0
during his @entity39 speech , @entity0 said , " in the @entity111 , non-assimilationist @entity9 establish enclaves and carry out as much of @entity114 law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home , " according to prepared remarks			1
" it is startling to think that any country would allow , even unofficially , for a so - called ' no - go zone			0
' the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom , " he said			0
@entity0 also suggested the rise of such no - go zones has contributed to growing anti-semitism throughout @entity5 , which has prompted many @entity133 to emigrate from their home countries			1
" how does such evil rise again in democratic countries ? " @entity0 asked			2
" i believe it is because radical islamists have been given too wide a berth to establish their own nation within a nation , " he said			0
@entity9 leaders need to " condemn anyone who commits these acts of violence , and clearly state that these people are evil and are enemies of @entity50 , " he added			2
the idea of " no - go zones " sparked controversy last week when a @entity152 commentator raised the prospect of areas in @entity155 , @entity63 , @entity156 and @entity157 where those countries ' governments " do n't exercise any sovereignty , " and which instead are run largely by @entity9 immigrants			1
the commentator also mentioned whole cities " where non-muslims simply do n't go in , " in particular the city of @entity166 in the @entity63			2
@entity63 prime minister @entity167 later pushed back on the idea , calling the commentator " a complete idiot			2
" " when i heard this , frankly , i choked on my porridge and i thought it must be @entity174			0
this guy is clearly a complete idiot , " he said			0
the @entity152 commentator later apologized to @entity166 for labeling it a no - go zone , but stood by the idea that such areas exist			1
@entity152 , however , issued a formal apology for the remarks , with host @entity184 retracting the comments as " regrettable errors " and saying the network " deeply regret ( s ) the errors and apologize ( s ) to any and all who may have taken offense			2
" @entity191 : @entity152 apologizes 4 times for inaccurate comments about @entity9 in @entity5 but a @entity0 aide said the governor stuck largely to the text as prepared , which included the criticism of the zones			1
and the remarks have drawn praise from conservatives and attacted national media attention at a time when the potential presidential contender is looking to raise his profile in time for a @entity208 bid			2
@entity210 columnist @entity209 called it a " brilliant take on radical @entity50			0
" " it is the toughest speech i have read on the whole issue of @entity50 radicalism and its destructive , murdering , barbarous ways which are upsetting the entire world , " @entity209 wrote in an op - ed. democrats , though , knocked @entity0			1
" it 's no surprise that @entity0 would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people -- this is exactly what we 've come to expect from @entity0 here at home , " @entity221 spokeswoman @entity220 told @entity2			0
" @entity0 is just embarrassing himself			0
he is abroad while @entity1 is facing a budget crisis of his own making -- he ca n't even govern his state , he is the last person we want wading into foreign policy			0
" opinion : @entity0 does n't know what he 's talking about			0

@entity1 gov. @entity0 decried " no - go zones , " where sovereign governments cede authority to @entity9
a @entity152 commentator sparked controversy when he mentioned the idea last week , which has been *debunked*
@entity0 stuck to his speech , however , and drew praise from conservatives
