@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 administration on wednesday slammed @entity6 's pugnacious rants toward @entity1 and the @entity7 and a @entity9 intelligence official called the strident remarks worrisome			1
" the ratcheting up of rhetoric is of concern to us , " the official said			1
the question is whether this is " just rhetoric , " he said			0
or , " are things happening behind the scenes indicating the blustering has something to it			0
" another @entity9 official said there is a lot of uncertainty about @entity6 's intentions			1
" @entity6 is not a paper tiger so it would n't be smart to dismiss its provocative behavior as pure bluster , " that official said			2
@entity9 says it sent @entity33 stealth bombers over @entity1 " what 's not clear right now is how much risk ( @entity6 leader ) @entity37 is willing to run , to show the world and domestic elites that he 's a tough guy			1
his inexperience is certain -- his wisdom is still very much in question			0
" @entity6 earlier said it was cutting off a key military hotline with @entity1 amid high tensions between the two sides			1
" under the situation where a war may break out any moment , there is no need to keep north - south military communications , " the head of a @entity6 delegation told the @entity1 by telephone wednesday , according to the @entity6 's state - run @entity49			1
there are several hotlines between @entity58			0
earlier this month , @entity59 disconnected a @entity61 hotline that ran through the border village of @entity63 and was used by officials on both sides , according to the @entity66			2
and senior @entity9 officials do not believe the cutting off of some communication by @entity6 in itself is indicative of more dramatic action or is conclusive			1
the officials note that @entity6 has cut these links before , some of them multiple times			2
" it 's part of the current threat - of - the - day pattern			0
i would n't extrapolate it to anything more conclusive , " one official said			0
" they want attention and they want to scare people both inside and outside their country			0
" officials see steps such as cutting off communication are more substitutes for doing other more dangerous things rather than precursors to more dangerous things			0
" that is certainly our fervent hope , " the official said			0
analysis : what 's @entity37 up to ? at the same time , there is concern about a @entity6 miscalculation during this time			2
the officials said the lack of communication could complicate and hamper the ability of all nations involved ( including @entity6 , @entity1 and the @entity9 ) to control and moderate any action -- and cycle of reaction should one begin as the result of a @entity6 miscalculation			1
the @entity109 linked its move to annual joint military exercises by @entity1 and the @entity9 , which it has cited in a string of threats against the two countries in recent weeks			1
tougher sanctions approved by the @entity117 also may have fueled its anger			0
" it is important the @entity9 send a message			2
in terms of the military side , the @entity9 has clearly sent a message , " the intelligence official said			1
" when people engage in this sort of rhetoric , you ca n't appear as if you are not responding , " the official said			2
the intelligence community has been providing the @entity4 administration with assessments of @entity37 's control of the regime , but the official would not provide any details of that assessment			2
administration officials also regretted the tough talk from @entity59			0
@entity141 spokesman @entity140 cited " more bellicose rhetoric and threats ( that ) follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others			2
" @entity147 , @entity148 principal deputy press secretary , said the @entity9 is committed to ensuring the security of its allies , such as @entity1			1
" @entity152 are not going to achieve anything through these threats and provocations			0
they 're only going to further isolate the @entity152 and undermine international efforts to bring peace and stability to northeast @entity160 , " @entity147 said			0
@entity162 spokesman @entity161 spoke on the government 's nuclear threats to the @entity9 and " its more achievable threats to attack @entity1 military units and shell border islands			1
" " we take their rhetoric seriously , whether it 's outside the norm which it sometimes is , or seems to suggest a more direct threat			0
and if you look at what they 've said recently , it 's been extremely provocative , threatening and bellicose			0
and it 's a complete mystery to me why they would deem it in their own interest to launch this type of rhetoric at us and our allies , " @entity161 said			0
@entity6 nightmare : experts ponder potential conflict the @entity109 's announcement wednesday appeared likely to affect the movement of people in and out of the @entity190 , a joint economic cooperation zone between the two @entity192 situated on the @entity6 's side of the border			1
" the measure taken by @entity6 is not beneficial for the stable operation of the @entity190 , and we urge them to withdraw the measure , " the @entity66 said			2
on thursday morning , the day after the @entity109 said it was severing the line , @entity1 workers were able to cross the border and enter the industrial zone , the semiofficial @entity1 news agency @entity199 reported , citing the @entity205 office in @entity206 , near the border			1
an initial group of 197 workers went over the border at 8:30 a.m. local time ( 7:30 p.m. wednesday et ) after @entity6 gave the regular approval for their movement by phone through the industrial district 's management committee , @entity199 said			1
a total of 530 @entity1 were due to enter the @entity190 complex on thursday , and 511 are scheduled to come back into @entity1 , according to @entity199			1
@entity6 's threats : five things to know a symbol of @entity1 cooperation , the @entity190 complex is also seen as an important source of hard currency for the regime in @entity59			1
the @entity109 previously cut off the @entity190 military hotline in march 2009 -- also during annual @entity9 - @entity1 military exercises -- but later reinstated it , according to @entity199			1
the slew of recent fiery rhetoric from @entity59 has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the @entity9 and @entity1 , as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the @entity235 in 1953 is no longer valid			1
behind the veil : a rare look at life in @entity6 on tuesday , the @entity109 said it planned to place military units tasked with targeting @entity9 bases under combat - ready status			2
most observers say @entity6 is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile , but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower , including medium - range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles			0
the heightened tensions on the @entity252 came after the @entity6 carried out a long - range rocket launch in december and an underground nuclear test last month , prompting the @entity117 to step up sanctions on the secretive regime			0
