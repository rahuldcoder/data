-- @entity4 @entity3 @entity2 candidate @entity1 says in a campaign ad that @entity7 incumbent @entity6 is the " best friend an illegal alien ever had			1
" according to her , he tolerates illegal people " sneaking " across the border and receiving " illegal @entity12 benefits			1
" one @entity7 commercial is n't much better			0
rep. @entity14 of @entity15 has a spot accusing his opponent , @entity17 , of helping illegal immigrants stay in the @entity19 and running a website offering advice on how to seek amnesty			1
not to be outdone , @entity24 candidate @entity23 calls for " closing the border			0
" she argues we need to stop illegal border crossings before any other legislative action is taken on immigration			2
explainer : illegal immigration 101 these and other appeals heard on the campaign trail this year are inflammatory and move the immigration issue in the wrong direction			1
they are based on erroneous assumptions and misguided arguments			0
these claims play to popular fears and emotions rather than reasoned debate over the controversy			0
similar to the views of many @entity19 , candidates are exaggerating the cost of immigration and underestimating its benefits			1
critics assume we can solve the illegal immigration problem through strict law enforcement and putting more money into border protection			2
spending on customs and border security rose from $ 7.4 billion in 2002 to $ 17 billion so far in 2010 , according to the @entity57 , yet we still have more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the @entity19			1
part of the misunderstanding is that 40 percent of those folks are here not through illegal border crossings but from overstaying visas			0
they came to @entity19 through lawful means , but did n't leave when their visas ran out			2
@entity69 arrived before 2000 , according to research by the @entity71 , so tougher border enforcement will not eliminate undocumented visitors			0
click for more commentary on timely topics in terms of the drain on government resources , skeptics fail to understand that many illegal immigrants actually pay taxes			1
they incur sales taxes on purchases , property taxes when they rent or buy homes , income taxes when they are employed , and @entity12 payments for jobs			1
a study by the @entity91 , for example , found that undocumented immigrants have contributed an estimated $ 120 billion to $ 240 billion to the social security trust fund , even though they are ineligible to receive @entity12 benefits			1
research by the @entity96 estimated that immigrants contributed $ 37 billion annually to the country 's overall economic activity			2
@entity19 cities with the biggest increases in numbers of immigrant workers also have the fastest growing economies			2
rather than a drag on economic growth and job creation , as is commonly thought , immigrants help spur economic growth through employment , tax payments and consumer purchases			0
immigrants are vital to @entity19 innovation and entrepreneurship			2
they perform jobs in agriculture , hotels , restaurants and constructions that many @entity19 do n't want			2
at the high - skilled end , they set up businesses and create high - paying jobs			0
one quarter of the technology and engineering businesses launched in @entity19 between 1995 and 2005 had an immigrant founder			0
in @entity131 , that number was 52.4 percent			0
these are not isolated stories			0
@entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , and @entity137 are among the companies with immigrant founders or co-founders			0
where would the @entity19 economy be if @entity134 were based in @entity143 , @entity135 in @entity144 , @entity136 in @entity145 , and @entity137 in @entity146 ? there would be far fewer jobs and much less technology innovation in the @entity19			1
to be sure , these ventures have come through the efforts of legal , and not illegal , immigrants			0
but , some of the crackdowns on undocumented workers , such as the @entity157 law , create a chilled climate for those here illegally , possibly persuading other immigrants to take their energy and innovation to other countries			0
it is time for candidates and political leaders to tell the real story about immigration			0
even though illegal immigrants enrage many @entity19 , it would be prohibitively expensive to deport 11 million people			1
as a vivid illustration of this point , the @entity172 found that mass deportations would cost $ 285 billion over five years , or an average of $ 900 for every @entity19			1
if people actually are worried about government cost , they should support the creation of a pathway to citizenship based on paying back taxes , learning @entity184 and collection of a serious fine for illegal entry			1
experts say that a full path to legalization would add $ 1.5 trillion to the @entity19 economy over the next decade			1
it would be cheaper to legalize illegal immigrants than keep them underground and outside the mainstream economy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity198 : campaign ads appeal to fears on immigration and *spread* bad *information*
illegal immigrants pay taxes , give billions to @entity12 but never get benefits , he writes
@entity196 notes the cost of deporting the 11 million illegal immigrants would be *astronomical*
path to citizenship would add $ 1.5 trillion to the @entity19 economy over 10 years , he says
