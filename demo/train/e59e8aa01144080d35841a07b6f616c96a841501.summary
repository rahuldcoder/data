-- @entity1 has vacationed in the @entity2 four times , and his experience entering the country has " steadily declined			1
" " last time , i was made to feel most unwelcome , " wrote @entity1 , a general manager from @entity6 , @entity7 , via e-mail			1
" i understand the huge levels of paranoia that exist in the @entity2 , but a bit of training in welcoming visitors ( and their money ) to the @entity15 might go a long way , " he wrote			2
after a long overseas flight , visitors to the @entity2 just want to land on terra firma , get some rest and get on with their business or leisure activities			1
but there are a few more hurdles to getting out of the airport , and a survey released tuesday suggests that clearing @entity27 is a big one			2
the government 's recent forced budget cuts are likely to make @entity27 lines still more daunting			0
" when you 're greeted with something that 's less than welcoming , that first taste in your mouth is quite disconcerting , " said @entity32 , chief operating officer of the @entity33 , the industry trade group that conducted the survey in partnership with @entity35			0
in the survey , 43 % of the travelers who have visited the @entity2 said they would discourage others from making the trip because of the entry process			1
the survey , which included responses from 1,200 overseas travelers , also found that more than two out of five potential business travelers wo n't come to the @entity2 in the next five years for the same reason			1
about 64 % of responders said they were frustrated by long lines and wait times			0
the survey was conducted in 2012 , before the forced government spending cuts under the sequester went into effect on march 1			0
yet the government spending cuts are likely to make the entry process " exponentially worse " for travelers , @entity32 said			1
automatic budget reductions must be applied to nearly every @entity60 program , including @entity27 , and " will negatively affect the mission readiness and capabilities of the men and women on our front lines , " the agency said in a statement responding to questions about sequestration			0
" @entity27 is working to minimize impacts to travelers to the greatest degree possible while maintaining the highest standards of security			0
" from march 5 to 11 , passengers on 260 flights experienced customs wait times of more than two hours , with some waits lasting more than three hours , the agency said			0
the @entity33 estimates that losing overseas travelers to bad experiences or word - of - mouth is costing the economy at least $ 95 billion in total output and more than a half million jobs across the economy			2
customs and @entity89 , which has developed programs in recent years to speed entry for trusted travelers who undergo prior screening , interviewed more than 25,000 travelers at @entity2 airports in july and august 2012 for its second customer satisfaction survey			1
" the survey is expected to be released this spring ; however , early results indicate that a large percentage of travelers agree the @entity27 process made them feel welcome to the @entity2 , " @entity27 said of its survey			1
overall , international arrivals to the @entity2 are up			2
the @entity104 expects 23 % growth in the number of annual international visitors by 2016			0
that number includes arrivals from @entity110 and @entity111 , which account for much of the growth			0
overseas arrivals , excluding @entity110 and @entity111 , are also up , but the @entity2 ' market share of overseas travelers has dropped from 17 % in 2000 to 12 % in 2011 , @entity32 said			1
@entity33 puts forward a three - pronged approach to welcoming international travelers to the @entity2 : promoting the @entity2 to international visitors , easing the process for getting visas and making the entry experience a smooth one			1
to compete with other countries in promoting tourism , the @entity2 ' first national tourism corporation , @entity15 , was established through the @entity123 in 2010			2
the @entity124 has done " tremendous work " in speeding up the visa process , @entity32 said , and posts visa interview wait times on consulate websites			0
@entity27 needs to adopt similar transparency , he said , in addition to committing to 30 minutes or less to process each arriving traveler and hiring an additional 1,000 officers to make the entry process more efficient			1
in an era when @entity60 secretary @entity136 has cautioned travelers to expect long airport security and customs lines because of worker overtime cuts and furloughs , finding the estimated $ 150 million to pay for those additional workers seems unlikely			0
@entity2 travel says easing the entry process is worth the investment			1
" it 's time to get this fixed , " @entity32 said			0
" our economy ca n't afford this kind of inefficiency			0
" what do you think ? what have you experienced in the @entity2 or other countries ?			2

survey : entry process is turning travelers off visiting the @entity2
overseas visitors have *increased* , but @entity2 market share is dropping
