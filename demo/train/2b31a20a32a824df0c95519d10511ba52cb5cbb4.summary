-- the @entity1 has decided it wo n't referee charges -- and countercharges -- of spying between the @entity5 and the @entity6			1
the @entity5 's general counsel and inspector general each made criminal referrals to the @entity1 seeking an investigation of whether @entity6 staffers obtained unauthorized access to classified documents related to the agency 's now - defunct post- 9/11 interrogation program			1
soon after , @entity6 chairman @entity16 went to the @entity6 floor to accuse the agency of spying on computers used by committee staffers at a @entity5 facility to investigate the @entity23 - era interrogation program			1
now , the @entity1 has notified the @entity5 and the @entity6 committee that it ca n't find enough evidence to warrant a full - blown probe			1
" the department carefully reviewed the matters referred to us and did not find sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal investigation , " @entity1 spokesman @entity27 said			2
@entity16 's office did n't immediately comment			0
critical report on @entity5 the unusual dispute has raised tensions between the agency and lawmakers charged with overseeing its activities			0
the committee has produced a 6,300 - page report on the program , which critics say violated prohibitions on torture and exceeded legal guidance from the @entity1			0
the @entity48 and the @entity5 are reviewing an executive summary of the report to remove classified information before it can be released			2
the documents that prompted the dispute relate to an internal review by former cia director @entity55 and , according to the agency , were intended to help summarize material it was providing to the committee for its investigation of the program			1
the documents were plainly labeled as for internal use and were not supposed to be reviewed by the committee , according to the @entity5			2
@entity16 said @entity6 staffers found the documents in the course of their work that were put in the computer system either on purpose by a whistleblower or perhaps in error , and that they corroborated some of the committee 's findings that the agency now says it disagrees with			1
she said committee staff routinely sees such documents and did n't violate any classified restrictions			2
senate majority leader @entity77 said thursday he believes the @entity6 has handled the matter appropriately			0
" i think what the @entity5 did to my senators is wrong			0
i 'm going to drop it at that , " @entity77 said			0
@entity84 sen. @entity83 of @entity85 said , " i still believe the @entity5 's entry into our computers was unacceptable perhaps even unconstitutional and we should n't let this drop until we have some sort of fundamental resolution of what happened			1
this was n't the first time this occurred and the division of powers in our nation 's constitution is at some risk here			0
" @entity83 said it 's time for the @entity48 and the @entity5 to release the portions of the @entity6 's report under review			1
@entity16 is usually one of the intelligence community 's staunchest allies in @entity109			0
@entity5 says it acted properly @entity5 director @entity110 has disputed @entity16 's accusations of agency wrongdoing in uncovering @entity6 staff access to the internal report			1
speaking to the @entity115 in march , he said , " when the facts come out on this , i think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong			0
" @entity125 , a @entity5 spokesman , said in an op - ed published in @entity127 in march that the agency acted properly after it discovered @entity6 staffers may have accessed and retained sensitive documents stored in a @entity5 computer network			1
" these documents were privileged , deliberative , pre-decisional executive branch material that implicated separation of powers concerns , " @entity125 wrote			0
" because we were concerned that there may have been a breach or vulnerability in the @entity5 local area network on which @entity5 stored these documents , @entity5 information technology specialists were asked to conduct a limited review to determine whether these files were located on the side of the @entity5 network the committee was authorized to use			2
that review appeared to confirm the committee 's unauthorized access to the documents			0
" @entity152 looks into dispute between @entity5 , @entity6			2

*prosecutors* say it ca n't find enough evidence to merit a full investigation
@entity5 sought probe of whether @entity6 staffers *improperly* accessed classified documents
the issue arose during @entity6 review of documents related to @entity5 's interrogation program
