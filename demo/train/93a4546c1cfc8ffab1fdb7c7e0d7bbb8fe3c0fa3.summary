when @entity1 becomes a major @entity0 cable channel , as it plans , some @entity0 are likely to click past it , recalling the alleged anti-american tone by the @entity6 network during the @entity8 war a decade ago			1
" my guess is that when people hear about @entity1 , they will not be paying attention to the news quality or correspondents , " said media analyst @entity9 , a retired professor at @entity11 at @entity12			1
" they will just hear @entity20 , and say it 's an @entity22 country and it 's full of terrorists and ... therefore bias in the news , " he said			2
the @entity20 government owns @entity1			2
others , however , may find any past political slants overshadowed by a newscast striving toward @entity0 standards			1
viewers may be curious just to hear @entity33 , which will have access to millions of @entity0 homes now that the traditional arabic - language network this week acquired current tv , once owned by former @entity0 vice president @entity38 and others			1
" i think it 's a very , very well - done news network , " said media expert and former @entity42 correspondent @entity41 of @entity43 in @entity44 , where he listens to a related network , @entity46 , now available in a tiny fraction of @entity0 markets			1
@entity46 also is live - streamed at no cost online and provides insight into what the bigger , new @entity33 will look like , he said			0
the emergence of @entity1 as a major @entity0 cable network has resurrected debate about past accusations of anti-american bias during the @entity8 invasion under president @entity59			1
the @entity59 administration excoriated the @entity22 peninsula 's network for broadcasting @entity64 videos			0
today , evidence of @entity0 antipathy at the @entity69 network has dissipated significantly , though not entirely , several analysts say			1
" it has obviously been demonized by our politicians for almost a decade , " said @entity70 , a former @entity71 producer and a media expert			0
he noted how an @entity1 cameraman was detained for six years at the @entity77 prison camp at @entity78 , @entity79			2
but @entity1 's current @entity81 broadcast is " excellent , " without the bias alleged by @entity0 politicians , said @entity70 , author of the roryoconnor.org blog and a contributor to @entity1 's website			1
he disputed conservatives ' portrayal of @entity1 as a " terror network " and propaganda outlet			2
other analysts , however , say @entity1 continues to telecast content that they deem to be anti-american			1
" surely they will be careful in the beginning			0
they will try to prove that they are a professional channel that 's objective , " said @entity94 , president of the @entity95 , which has gathered several @entity1 video clips in recent years that the institute says show anti-american bias			1
@entity94 is a former chief counterterrorism adviser to @entity103 prime ministers @entity102 and @entity104			0
" it 's much less anti-american than in the past , and the @entity81 ( broadcast ) is a soft version " of the @entity69 telecast , @entity94 continued			0
" but this is the government of @entity20			0
it 's to discuss the government of @entity20			0
it 's a policy arm of the ruler of @entity20			0
" spokesmen for @entity1 could n't be reached by @entity114 for comment			2
in language that will surely be open for debate once @entity33 enters @entity0 homes , @entity94 used strong words in describing the @entity20 government			1
" @entity20 , after all , is a dictatorship , and in a dictatorship , they use media as an arm of foreign policy , be it @entity22 or @entity129 foreign policy or an international one , " he said			0
the @entity20 government 's decision to bring @entity1 into @entity0 homes is a provocative political maneuver -- as well as an emerging business strategy now being pursued by other government - sponsored networks , experts said			1
" can i note the unusual nature or essential weirdness of a former vice president of the @entity0 selling his network to an @entity22 - based network that is owned by a foreign government ? " said media expert @entity138 , host of the weekly @entity114 program " @entity141			1
" @entity1 has always been regarded as something of a vanity venture by the wealthy emir of @entity20 , which is home to the world 's third largest gas reserve and is spending billions of dollars on its public image profile by sponsoring sports events at home and in @entity158 , experts said			1
" @entity1 has been trying and failing for years to get on television here in the @entity0 , " media writer @entity159 of @entity160 told @entity114			1
" for the most part , @entity1 is buying this for the real estate because it 's beachfront real estate			2
" @entity41 , of @entity43 , referred to how @entity1 reportedly paid $ 500 million to acquire current tv , whose access to 60 million households is now expected to be largely transferred to @entity33			1
" if you have bottomless pockets , it does n't make any difference what you pay or how you go forward , " @entity41 said			0
" i think the assumed price of $ 500 million is absurd for what they got			0
on the other hand , it makes no difference to the emir of @entity20 because it 's chump change to him			0
" but one cable company has balked at carrying @entity33 : @entity184 stopped carrying @entity185 upon the announcement of the @entity1 deal			2
a @entity184 spokeswoman said that past bias allegations against @entity1 did n't factor into the firm 's decision			1
analysts agreed , saying the company could be leveraging @entity33 , seeking to get a per - subscriber payment for the cable firm in exchange for carrying the channel			2
" this has nothing to do with politics			0
we treat @entity1 like any other network , " said a @entity184 spokeswoman			0
" we will look to gauge our customer interest in @entity33 and assess whether it is a good value for our customers			0
" commentary : why @entity1 has set its sites on the @entity0 @entity33 is n't an isolated phenomenon			1
another government - sponsored media outlet that has ventured into @entity0 broadcasting is @entity214 's @entity213 , launched last year			2
" the @entity214 have about a similar coverage of the @entity0 media market as @entity1 does right now , " @entity41 said			1
" they are using a soft diplomacy and no one is saying it 's a propaganda outlet			0
their approach is very thoughtful , but it 's all @entity214 and that 's what people are hungry for			0
" @entity41 wondered why @entity33 would plan to produce 60 % of its content in the @entity0 , as it has said , when @entity1 has increasingly become renowned for its coverage of the @entity227 , especially during the recent @entity229 revolutions			1
politics aside , @entity33 will find @entity0 audiences to be tough customers			2
the @entity22 royal - family - owned network will be entering a tumultuous , fragmented marketplace for news programming where the top - ranked cable news shows garner ratings only in the hundreds of thousands at any one time , not millions , analysts said			1
furthermore , access to 60 million homes does n't guarantee that many people will be watching the program , analysts said			0
international newscasts in particular can also be a hard sell , experts said			0
" a lot will depend on how much appetite there is in the @entity0 market for international news			1
a lot of these organizations have cut back on that , " @entity138 said			0
carriers " are getting hate mail from some viewers who do n't want to see it on their cable lineup , " the @entity160 ' @entity159 said about @entity1			2
" but money can change a lot of these problems and they have a lot of it			0

media analysts say the past @entity267 bias of @entity1 has largely *subsided*
but one group collects @entity1 video clips that it says show bias
the decision to bring @entity1 into @entity0 homes is a political maneuver , some say
the new venture will find the cable news market *competitive*
