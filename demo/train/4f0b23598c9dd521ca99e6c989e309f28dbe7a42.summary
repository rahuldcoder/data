-- @entity1 has applied for a patent on metered , pay - as - you - go computing			1
under a @entity1 proposal , consumers would receive heavily discounted pcs , then pay fees for usage			1
@entity11 patent application number 20080319910 , published on christmas day , details @entity1 's vision of a situation where a " standard model " of pc is given away or heavily subsidized by someone in the supply chain			1
the end user then pays to use the computer , with charges based on both the length of usage time and the performance levels utilized , along with a " one - time charge			1
" @entity1 notes in the application that the end user could end up paying more for the computer , compared with the one - off cost entailed in the existing @entity17 business model , but argues the user would benefit by having a pc with an extended " useful life			1
" " a computer with scalable performance level components and selectable software and service options has a user interface that allows individual performance levels to be selected , " reads the patent application 's abstract			1
the patent application was filed june 21 , 2007			0
" the scalable performance level components may include a processor , memory , graphics controller , etc. @entity43 and services may include word processing , email , browsing , database access , etc. to support a pay - per - use business model , each selectable item may have a cost associated with it , allowing a user to pay for the services actually selected and that presumably correspond to the task or tasks being performed , " the abstract continues			1
@entity57 to @entity1 's vision is a security module , embedded in the pc , that would effectively lock the pc to a certain supplier			2
" the metering agents and specific elements of the security module ... allow an underwriter in the supply chain to confidently supply a computer at little or no upfront cost to a user or business , aware that their investment is protected and that the scalable performance capabilities generate revenue commensurate with actual performance level settings and usage , " the application reads			2
' a more granular approach ' according to the application , the issue with the existing @entity17 business model is that it " requires more or less a one chance at the consumer kind of mentality , where elasticity curves are based on the pressure to maximize profits on a one - time - sale , one - shot - at - the - consumer mentality			1
" @entity1 's proposed model , on the other hand , could " allow a more granular approach to hardware and software sales , " the application states , adding that the user " may be able to select a level of performance related to processor , memory , graphics power , etc that is driven not by a lifetime maximum requirement but rather by the need of the moment			2
" " when the need is browsing , a low level of performance may be used and , when network - based interactive gaming is the need of the moment , the highest available performance may be made available to the user , " the document reads			2
" because the user only pays for the performance level of the moment , the user may see no reason to not acquire a device with a high degree of functionality , in terms of both hardware and software , and experiment with a usage level that suits different performance requirements			0
" by way of example , the application posits a situation involving three " bundles " of applications and performance : office , gaming , and browsing			0
" the office bundle may include word - processing and spreadsheet applications , medium graphics performance and two of three processor cores , " the document reads			0
" the gaming bundle may include no productivity applications but may include 3d graphics support and three of three processor cores			0
the browsing bundle may include no productivity applications , medium graphics performance and high - speed network interface			0
" " charging for the various bundles may be by bundle and by duration			0
for example , the office bundle may be $ 1.00 [ 68 pence ] per hour , the gaming bundle may be $ 1.25 per hour and the browsing bundle may be $ 0.80 per hour			0
the usage charges may be abstracted to ' units / hour ' to make currency conversions simpler			0
alternatively , a bundle may incur a one - time charge that is operable until changed or for a fixed - usage period , " the document reads			2
@entity1 's patent application does acknowledge that a per - use model of computing would probably increase the cost of ownership over the pc 's lifetime			1
the company argues in its application , however , that " the payments can be deferred and the user can extend the useful life of the computer beyond that of the one - time purchase machine			2
" the document suggests that " both users and suppliers benefit from this new business model " because " the user is able to migrate the performance level of the computer as needs change over time , while the supplier can develop a revenue stream business that may actually have higher value than the one - time purchase model currently practiced			1
" " rather than suffering through less - than - adequate performance for a significant portion of the life of a computer , a user can increase performance level over time , at a slight premium of payments , " the application reads			1
" when the performance level finally reaches its maximum and still better performance is required , then the user may upgrade to a new computer , running at a relatively low performance level , probably with little or no change in the cost of use			0

@entity1 has applied for a patent on metered , pay - as - you - go computing
under its plan , a standard pc would be given away or heavily subsidized
consumers would then pay regular fees to use the computer
charges would be based on length of usage time and @entity17 performance levels
