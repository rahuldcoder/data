-- at the funeral of @entity3 president @entity2 , his good friend , @entity5 president @entity2 , was photographed embracing @entity2 's bereaved mother , in a show of compassion and support			1
back home in @entity11 , @entity2 was immediately bashed by newspapers and by conservative politicians who cited a religious prohibition against touching a woman who is not your wife or a relative			1
while theology is a factor , there may have been a deeper message to this backlash from @entity11 : that it 's no longer cool to be supporting @entity2 , his family and political allies , and that this alliance , like others cultivated by @entity2 , may be in jeopardy			2
@entity2 put great effort into his friendship with @entity5 and into a broader alliance with other states in @entity34 , with both efforts motivated in part by opposition to the @entity39 ' international role			1
@entity2 's death is certainly changing the political calculus in @entity3 , but will it also result in a broader shift that could realign much of @entity34 and affect attitudes toward , and relationships with , the @entity39 ? the answer is likely " yes			1
" first , the grouping of nations previously opposing the @entity39 under @entity2 's leftist alliance -- namely the " @entity50 " alliance , comprised of @entity3 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 -- could well wither away , due to @entity3 's ongoing recession and fears that alliance members will no longer have @entity3 's financial backing			1
when combined with reports of @entity2 's expressed desire to strengthen ties with the @entity63 administration , regional hostility towards the @entity39 may decline			1
since assuming office in 1999 , @entity2 viewed @entity65 as an oppressive force manipulating @entity34 politics while keeping the region underdeveloped through its dependence on @entity39 resources			1
in response , @entity2 approached like - minded leaders to build a coalition challenging the regional influence of the @entity39			1
by 2005 , @entity54 , @entity53 , @entity51 , @entity75 and @entity52 joined @entity2 's coalition , which led to the formation of the @entity78 of the @entity79 , also known as @entity50			1
@entity50 served as an alternative to the @entity81 of the @entity79 , with an explicit focus on poverty reduction , but it also facilitated the unification of these nations in their anti-american sentiments			0
with @entity2 gone , however , there may be no one left who has the clout to keep financing this alliance			2
@entity3 is @entity50 's largest financier , contributing millions in aid to its members as well as oil at low prices			2
but @entity3 may believe that with ongoing poverty and inequality , their country 's needs are more important than those of @entity2 's small club of nations			1
this situation worries @entity50 members			0
according to @entity107 of the @entity108 , while @entity54 and @entity52 are independently wealthy and not financially dependent on @entity3 , @entity51 and @entity53 are			0
@entity51 receives roughly 100,000 barrels of @entity3 oil a day , while @entity3 accounted for $ 8.3 billion of @entity51 's $ 20 billion in foreign trade in 2011			0
@entity2 also paid approximately $ 6 billion annually for 40,000 @entity51 doctors and nurses , according to @entity114			0
@entity51 citizens fear that @entity2 's death will push them back to the days of the @entity118 recession , when @entity119 gradually withdrew its funding for @entity51			1
meanwhile , @entity53 has received approximately $ 500 million a year in loans and oil credits , increasing to $ 609 million in 2011 , while earnings from agricultural exports to @entity3 increased from $ 2 million in 2006 to $ 300 million in 2011			0
but alliance members also realize that they have options			0
@entity53 's economic minister , @entity127 , recently stated that it 's time to diversify @entity53 's economic relations with @entity130 , @entity131 and the @entity39 , mainly because @entity53 has " to anticipate that @entity50 is not going to be permanent			2
" @entity51 may also seek to strengthen its relations with @entity133 , its second - largest trade partner in the region			0
in fact , both governments already have plans to engage in several trade and infrastructure projects and are ramping up trade , mainly in sugar exports			0
@entity52 and @entity53 are working more closely with @entity133 in helping to construct hydroelectric energy plants and chemical industries , respectively			0
in addition to strong economic growth rates , @entity133 president @entity146 's policy commitments to the poor and enhanced control over key economic sectors , such as oil , may provide a more appealing leftist model			0
in recent years , @entity2 was also interested in improving relations with the @entity39			2
he saw president @entity63 's re-election victory as an opportunity to strengthen diplomatic ties			0
@entity2 once commented : " i wish we could begin a new period of normal relations			0
" @entity2 was so committed to this endeavor that even from his hospital in @entity51 , he authorized his second in command , vice president @entity164 , to start negotiating with the @entity165			0
while it may seem that @entity164 may have a difficult time working with the @entity39 , considering his accusations that the @entity39 has historically plotted against @entity3 and the recent removal of @entity39 diplomats from @entity171 , it appears that this was mainly done to gain the trust of @entity2 political supporters in order to secure @entity164 's position as the next president			1
@entity39 diplomatic officials view @entity164 as a pragmatist and the fact that he was supportive of initiating closer ties with the @entity39 last year suggests that this could continue , especially in light of @entity3 's economic troubles and the need to increase revenues through trade			2
@entity2 's passing should motivate the @entity39 to seek a new partnership with @entity3			1
first , secretary of state @entity189 should reopen the @entity39 embassy in @entity171 , which has been closed since 2010 , while assigning diplomats who are committed to engaging in peaceful dialogue and political and economic cooperation			0
second , @entity189 should take this opportunity to strengthen cooperation over issues that can provide mutual benefits in the areas of national security and the economy , such as counternarcotics , counterterrorism , as well as sustaining oil trade : the @entity39 currently imports just under 1 million barrels a day from @entity3			2
but the @entity39 should also see this situation as an opportunity to strengthen its ties with other nations , such as @entity51			0
with the likely decline in economic assistance to @entity51 from @entity3 , @entity51 president @entity208 may consider stepping up negotiations with the @entity63 administration over the @entity39 embargo , human rights and the release of @entity34 prisoners , such as @entity217			1
@entity2 is gone , but the @entity39 ' commitment to peaceful democratic relations persists			2
going forward , the @entity39 should explore ways of strengthening its ties with @entity3 and other @entity34 nations			1
but this is not a one - way street : @entity164 in @entity3 will also need to find ways to strengthen his government 's ties with the @entity39 , which may be a balancing act if he wants to sustain his government 's good relations with @entity5 , particularly after @entity2 leaves office			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234			0

@entity234 : @entity2 *criticized* back home for *hugging* @entity2 's mother
he says support in @entity5 may be waning for alliance with @entity3
@entity242 *bankrolled* anti- @entity39 alliance , but new leaders may not want to , he says
@entity234 : nations in @entity34 may see benefits of improved relations with @entity39
