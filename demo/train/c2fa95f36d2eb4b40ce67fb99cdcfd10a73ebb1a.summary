@entity0 will be the first to tell you just how tough he was			1
raised to never run from a fight , @entity0 started running with a gang at 14			1
with his father in prison and absent from his life , the gang was everything to @entity0			1
" it gave me a sense of being , " said @entity0 , now 31			1
running with the @entity10 in the @entity12 neighborhood of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity0 says he felt the need to prove himself			1
" i had to make myself meaner and tougher , " he said			2
he got his first gun at 16 and admits " shooting people and running away from the police " were his adrenaline			2
@entity0 thought he might one day get shot and killed			1
he never expected to get shot and paralyzed			1
what happens when you do n't die ? it was around midnight on october 9 , 2004 , when @entity0 returned home after a car chase with rival gang members			1
thinking he 'd lost them , he was outside chatting with a friend when two men walked by			2
he thought they were neighbors until they opened fire			0
@entity0 was hit with a barrage of bullets , one severing his spinal cord			1
" it never entered my head about being paralyzed or anything , " @entity0 said recently as he maneuvered his wheelchair down the street , pointing to the corner where he was shot			1
" it was right there			0
that 's where i ended up getting shot ... i fell into the street right here , " he said			2
for @entity47 , a former gang member from @entity49 's northwest side , the memory of the moment he was shot is just as clear			1
on may 6 , 1998 , from the driver 's window of his car , @entity47 watched a rival step out of an alley , raise his pistol and fire a single shot			1
the bullet went through the seat and hit @entity47 in the spine , he said			1
one bullet was all it took			0
when doctors told @entity47 he 'd never walk again , his whole world shattered			1
before that moment , he thought he was invincible			0
a double life @entity47 says he joined a gang for protection			1
he was a skinny , scared 15 - year - old in a neighborhood where there were shootings nearly every day			0
he could n't get to school without being harassed , chased , or beaten up , he said			0
after joining the gang , @entity47 felt he was leading a double life			1
he maintained a good gpa at school , and at home he was a caring son and a good brother for his younger siblings , @entity47 said			1
but out on the streets , he said , " i made less than favorable decisions			0
" @entity47 said he was trying to leave the gang when he was shot			1
whether it 's drug dealing or gang activities , the outcomes you hear about are always the same , @entity47 said			1
" you only hear about death or jail			0
you never hear about this disability , " he said			2
lifelong disability and health care for @entity47 and @entity0 , permanent disability and lifetime health care are their new reality			1
according to the @entity99 , acts of violence , primarily gunshot wounds , are the third leading cause of spinal cord injury among @entity103 adults			0
experts say young , uninsured men are affected disproportionately			0
the cost to society is huge			1
health care can cost up to a $ 1 million per patient in the first year alone , and up to $ 181,000 for each year after that			1
dr. @entity110 , head of rehabilitation at @entity49 's @entity112 , says nearly half of all spinal cord injuries that come through the hospital 's trauma unit are the result of gunshot wounds			0
" imagine being fully independent , get a gunshot wound and all of a sudden you 're paralyzed , you ca n't work , you ca n't take care of bodily functions ... that 's what we 're dealing with , " @entity110 said			1
everyday tasks are beyond challenging			0
for @entity0 , just going to the bathroom is difficult			1
" it really humbles you , " he said			0
and being intimate with another person ? " that scares the hell out of me , " he said			0
" i have very , very low self - esteem			0
" @entity0 lives on his own in a small house that is barely wheelchair accessible			1
still , he insists on doing most things himself			0
" just because i 'm in a wheelchair , " he said , " if i do n't do something and have to ask someone else , it 's like giving up			0
" his biggest health threat , he says , is the bedsores he gets from being in his chair			2
when we visited @entity0 , he had just come home from the hospital after one of his bedsores became infected			1
@entity0 underwent several surgeries ; part of his hip bone had to be removed			1
dr. @entity152 , director of the trauma center at @entity49 's @entity112 , said the majority of the patients his center treats survive their injuries but are left with long - term disabilities			0
a high price to pay @entity0 no longer looks at the medical bills that come			1
he knows he can not afford the cost of his care			1
in the first year of his recovery , @entity0 estimates , he had more $ 1 million in health care bills that were passed on to taxpayers			1
the ongoing cost of hospital stays for bedsores , he says , is about $ 40,000 a year			2
" there is a financial cost for those injured in gun violence , " said @entity170 , director of the @entity171 at @entity172 in @entity49			2
because victims are " disproportionately young and uninsured , " she said , " the cost is borne by the rest of us			2
" @entity47 was 17 and uninsured when he got shot			1
he feels those paralyzed by gun violence are forgotten victims			2
" every once in a while you 'll see or hear something in the news about the aftermath , but not enough , " he said			0
@entity47 believes if people were more aware of the cost to society , more might be done to find solutions to the violence			1
" everybody is a victim of their circumstances			0
... whether it 's bad role models or just poverty , the help is not there that we need , " he said			0
the bystander @entity205 , 56 , was an innocent bystander when a bullet struck him while he was driving in a @entity49 suburb on may 3 of this year			0
" all of a sudden a big boom , big sound and then pain like a big punch through my left shoulder , and i lost control from my neck down , " @entity205 said			0
gun violence , unfortunately , is nothing new to @entity205			0
at age 7 , he says , he was playing outside his house in the suburbs just south of @entity49 when a bullet pierced his upper thigh			0
he survived that -- and he survived being shot again this time			2
but the most recent bullet has left @entity205 a quadriplegic			0
these costly , life - changing injuries affect not only those caught up in street wars , but also those who have nothing at all to do with the violence			0
@entity205 is a pastor , a high school math teacher and a father who was in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
" you know , i do n't hold any bitterness or anger			0
i just want the violence to stop , " he said , as a tear rolled down his cheek			0
from gang war to peace @entity0 and @entity47 take full responsibility for their situations and acknowledge their role in the violence			1
but today , both are working to fight violence on the streets of their respective cities			0
@entity0 works at the @entity251 in @entity13			2
that job -- and the people he meets through it -- give him reason , he says , to go on			2
" i can give up , just sit on disability and just not do nothing with my life and stay home and just freakin ' fade away , " said @entity0			1
" i 'd much rather do something , and this is why i do the work i do now			2
" " as long as i stop one kid from going down the wrong path , then -- bang -- i already saved a life , " he said			2
@entity47 mentored young men who were making mistakes similar to those he made and helped those with spinal cord injuries			2
he just graduated with a master 's degree in social work , and he 's working full - time as an admission coordinator at @entity275 in @entity49 until he gets his license to practice social work			2
" they say everything happens for a reason			0
this might be my reason			0
just so i can prevent somebody from following my same road , " he said			0
blame weak gun laws for holiday violence , @entity49 's top cop says ptsd from your zip code : urban violence and the brain			0

former gang members @entity0 and @entity47 were paralyzed after being shot
permanent disability and lifetime health care is their new reality .
the cost of care is huge -- for the victims and society
@entity0 and @entity47 now work to help others make the right choices
