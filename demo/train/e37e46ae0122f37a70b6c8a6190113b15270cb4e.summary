-- thousands marched in @entity2 this weekend to call for action to counter climate change			1
with organizers estimating 35,000 people filling the @entity7 , the forward on @entity10 march was said to be the biggest demonstration thus far in support of this issue			0
" while they were fighting for equality , " the rev. @entity14 told the crowd , comparing them to those who took part in the march on @entity2 for civil rights in 1963 , " we are fighting for existence			2
" the protesters have support from president @entity24 , who announced that he wants to make climate change a major issue in his second term			1
during his inaugural and @entity30 addresses , the president did not shy away from this controversial subject			0
but persuading @entity32 to pass this kind of legislation will be extremely difficult			2
photos : 40,000 rally to stop @entity38 pipeline standing tuesday before visibly unhappy house speaker @entity39 , @entity24 pointed to the recent natural disasters we 've seen and spoke about the science of the environment , calling on @entity32 to act -- or threatening to do so himself if they refuse : " we can choose to believe that @entity45 , and the most severe drought in decades , and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence			1
or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it 's too late			0
republicans kept their hands in their pockets			0
if @entity24 can persuade @entity32 to take action on climate change , it would be one of the biggest accomplishments of his administration			1
but unlike some of the other issues that he has tackled -- including health care -- climate change is extraordinarily difficult since the benefits to voters are not immediate and not necessarily visible			1
his mission could be made more difficult if he decides to approve the proposal for the @entity38 , which would run from @entity71 to the @entity72			0
environmental groups that backed the president 's re-election strongly oppose the project			2
to break through the gridlock on this issue and to persuade some of the congressional republicans to start clapping , @entity24 will need more than crisis and science			2
the march this weekend must be the first of more organized grass - roots protests , not just on the mall in @entity2 but in the districts and states of key members of @entity32			1
most of the biggest policy breakthroughs in recent history have depended on strong grass - roots mobilization			1
in 1935 , @entity32 passed the @entity93 , which created the @entity94 and legitimated unions			2
this mobilization of industrial workers who would form the cio was pivotal in providing president @entity100 with the strength he needed to take on business with enormously controversial legislation			0
several decades later , the @entity104 only came about because local activists , led by prominent leaders such as rev. @entity107 , forced the @entity108 and @entity32 to deal with the issue of racial equality over their deep political reservations			2
while both presidents @entity112 and @entity114 were concerned about the huge risks that pushing for civil rights posed for the @entity53 ' stronghold in the @entity118 -- still the electoral base of the party back then -- both were finally moved to take action because of the valiant efforts of grass - roots activists who placed pressure on them and on uncommitted legislators			1
the civil rights movement changed public opinion and made inaction politically unacceptable			0
conservatives have also depended on the grass roots to mobilize support for their issues			2
president @entity136 's drive for deficit - inducing tax cuts and deregulation might not have worked if it were not for the grass - roots conservative activism of the 1970s that pushed national debate to the right			1
in the past few years , tea party activists have succeeded in moving the @entity145 toward an agenda of deficit reduction even at a moment when the key problem is generating economic growth and lowering unemployment rates			0
environmental organizations have created a vast organizational infrastructure since the 1970s and remain a huge presence in @entity2			2
but in recent years , they have been less effective at developing the same level of grass - roots energy as earlier movements , including their own in the 1970s			1
climate change has too often been an issue that is @entity2 - focused rather than grass - roots focused			1
instead of having former vice president @entity163 be the face of efforts to counter climate change , @entity24 needs the images of local protesters gathering to make sure that @entity32 deals with the issue			1
@entity24 , a former community organizer , knows this as much as anyone			0
he has seen the profound effect tea party activists have had on the @entity145 , much to his consternation			0
as @entity178 political scientist @entity177 has written , " to counter fierce political opposition , reformers will have to build organizational networks across the country , and they will need to orchestrate sustained political efforts that stretch far beyond friendly congressional offices , comfy board rooms and posh retreats ... insider politics can not carry the day on its own , apart from a broader movement pressing politicians for change			0
" @entity190 explains convincingly that one of the reasons for the failure of cap and trade legislation was that climate reformers focused their energy on @entity198 lobbying rather than mobilizing support in local communities			0
members of @entity32 know that climate change legislation does n't offer tangible benefits to voters , so they 're unlikely to act unless they feel pressure from activists in their districts			1
sens. @entity212 , i - @entity209 , and @entity210 , @entity211 , have taken the lead on the issue by putting forth a bill to impose a tax on the country 's largest polluters , requiring them to pay $ 20 per ton of carbon and methane emissions , a sum that would rise over time			1
under their bill , the government would invest the money in developing renewable fuel and more efficient energy policies , including a plan to weatherize more than a million homes			0
if the administration is going to build support for a version of this legislation , it will need support from the bottom , not just the top , in swaying and pressuring senators who will be leery about taking on this issue			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242			0

thousands marched in @entity2 to seek action on climate change
@entity242 : president @entity24 called action on issue a *priority* in last week 's speech
convincing @entity32 to pass a bill on climate change is a heavy lift , @entity242 says
@entity242 : grass - roots organizing will be *crucial* to passage of a bill
