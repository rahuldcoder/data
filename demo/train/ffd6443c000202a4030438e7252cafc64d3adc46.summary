-- it 's been a busy year for the @entity3 royal family			1
the @entity4 and the @entity5 alone covered almost 48,000 miles to undertake 804 official engagements between april 2011 and the end of march this year			0
so who pays the bills ? prince @entity11 ' office at @entity12 released its annual review friday , shedding light on how money is spent on the couple , as well as princes @entity17 and @entity18 and , of course , the newest addition to the family , @entity22 , @entity22			1
as the queen 's eldest son , @entity11 , @entity4 , is mostly funded by the @entity25 , a private estate consisting of more than 200 square miles of agricultural , commercial and residential land mostly in southwest @entity29			0
in the 2011 - 12 fiscal year , the prince 's private income from the duchy rose by 3 % to slightly more than $ 28.5 million			0
he received an additional $ 3.42 million in public funding from @entity35 and government departments , a year - on - year increase of 11.8 %			0
with more private and public income , prince @entity11 ' household spending increased by 4.1 % to $ 15.3 million , and all 135 full - time staff members received a pay raise of 3 %			2
nine of those employees work for @entity17 and @entity18 , and for @entity22 , @entity22			2
so what is the expense of the royal family 's newest member ? " it 's actually quite minimal , " said prince @entity11 ' communications secretary , @entity57 , " there 's been quite a lot of focus on things like clothes but actually , when you look at the numbers , it 's mostly absorbed into the existing expenditure			1
" a royal aide added that it would be " rather impolite " to disclose how much money had been spent on the dresses that hit front pages of newspapers around the world every time @entity22 steps out in public			1
what we do know , though , is that prince @entity11 pays for his daughter - in - law 's outfits for official engagements out of his private income			0
anti-monarchy groups such as @entity73 have criticized the royal family for using public money to travel			1
" prince @entity11 gives little back to the country yet has a deeply held sense of entitlement when it comes to accessing public funds , " chief executive @entity76 said friday			0
" we believe time is long overdue that the government brought royal spending under proper control			1
" however , @entity57 maintains : " members of the royal family do a huge amount of work			1
... we really feel it 's fantastic value for money			2
as it happens , 90 % of it is his ( prince @entity11 ' ) own income , so it 's not coming from central government coffers			0
" royal aides champion the continued success of the prince 's group of 16 charities as the greatest example of the royal family giving back to the public			1
between april 2011 and the end of march this year , the @entity4 directly or indirectly raised more than $ 200 million for his charities , which support young people , the environment and enterprise			0
after last year 's royal wedding and the recent @entity114 celebrations , polls have showed that the @entity3 royal family is as popular as ever			2
riding high on that wave is the household of the @entity4 , as exemplified by the 76,825 letters received from the public in 2011 - 12			2
that is more than double the mail from the previous year .			0
