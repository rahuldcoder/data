-- a mentally disabled woman and her daughter were held in an @entity5 apartment crowded with people and animals for more than a year , forced to perform manual labor and threatened with dogs and snakes to keep them compliant , authorities said tuesday			1
federal prosecutors said the people accused of holding the pair in @entity15 , about 60 miles south of @entity16 , collected the woman 's government benefits and beat her in order to get painkillers for themselves			1
they kept her in a room with a free - ranging iguana and ordered her to feed the reptile fruits and vegetables her daughter was denied , according to court papers			1
sometimes their captors ' pit bulls got table food while they had to eat from cans , according to an arrest affidavit quoting witnesses			1
" the living conditions were simply subhuman , " said @entity33 , @entity34 attorney for the @entity35			1
" ( we 're ) talking about people who were locked in rooms , forced to work all the time , people who were threatened and beaten and injured , people who were exploited , people who had their money and benefits stolen , sort of used as pawns to get drugs , " he told @entity0 's @entity37			1
" and the worst part of all this is , you know , they tried to rob the victims of their basic human dignity			2
so almost everything they did was to prey on them , prey on their vulnerabilities and exploit them			2
" the mother and daughter were sometimes forced to eat dog food , according to a law enforcement source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation			1
they were also frequently denied access to the bathroom , @entity65 special agent @entity64 told reporters			2
" they were physically punished for toiletry accidents , " he said , " and they were threatened not only with weapons but also with vicious animals , to include pit bulls and pythons			0
" family and attorney deny accusations three people -- 26 - year - old @entity80 , 31 - year - old @entity81 and 33 - year - old @entity82 -- were arrested and charged with forced labor			1
@entity86 is facing an additional count of witness tampering , and another arrest could come soon , the @entity34 attorney 's office in @entity16 said			2
@entity86 's mother , @entity90 , told @entity0 's @entity91 that the accusations are false , and that the alleged victim was allowed to leave the apartment whenever she wanted			1
" there are so many lies going on , " she said , accusing investigators of trumping up the case to draw attention to the small city of @entity15			0
" she was giving them a couple hundred dollars a month for staying there			0
she was getting her own food			2
she was n't being starved , " @entity86 's mother said			1
her son , she said , is devastated by the accusations			2
" he 's devastated that all of this is being said about them			2
they have some pit bulls and snakes , so they are making them out to be evil because they have that , " she said			0
he always has since he was a kid			0
" an attorney for @entity86 told @entity0 affiliate @entity120 that the allegations are ludicrous			1
" she had opportunities to leave			0
she left several times and came back			0
so this was a mutual arrangement for her , " attorney @entity124 told @entity120			0
" i do n't like that the federal prosecutors held a press conference to pat themselves on the back			0
" attorneys representing @entity81 and @entity82 could not be immediately reached by @entity0 for comment			1
prosecutor : ' they treated her worse than they treated the animals ' but a criminal complaint filed this week alleges that the mother and her daughter were padlocked inside the bedroom they shared			1
" these individuals in this case preyed upon a human being 's disability and her desire to protect her child , the most fundamental of human traits , " @entity33 said			2
the suspects " used that to force her into servitude , to work like an animal , and indeed , as the complaint alleges , they treated her worse than they treated the animals that were in that house			2
" @entity81 and @entity86 are a couple but are not married , @entity65 spokeswoman @entity160 said			0
@entity82 was a friend of theirs , she said			0
before they were allegedly forced into servitude for two years , the victims knew their alleged captors , the law enforcement source said			1
the woman was identified in court papers only as " @entity170 " investigators stated @entity86 and @entity81 persuaded her to move into the apartment they shared with @entity81 's four sons and " numerous " animals , knowing she " suffered from a cognitive disability and received monthly public assistance payments			1
" that was in may 2011			0
her plight came to the attention of authorities in october 2012 , when she was arrested for trying to steal a candy bar from a store			0
then she was arrested on a state child - welfare charge as part of the case , @entity15 police chief @entity183 said			0
" the officers that took that complaint detected that there was other issues aside from the shoplifting , " @entity183 said			0
he said officers had had " numerous involvements " with the people involved , " and in the course of interviewing her , they discovered the rest of these facts slowly			0
" according to prosecutors , @entity86 showed police a mobile - phone video of @entity170 beating her child			0
@entity170 told police that she had been told to do so by @entity205 and @entity81 and that @entity86 threatened to show police the video if she " messed up " or went to authorities			0
@entity170 was released from jail in february after being sentenced to time served on the abuse charge , and her daughter is now in foster care , said @entity212 , a spokesman for the @entity34 attorney 's office			1
once the full picture emerged , @entity15 police called in the @entity65 , " and shortly after , the suspects were indicted , " @entity183 said			2
' all of us ... need to work on being better neighbors ' @entity86 and @entity81 kept tabs on the woman and child with a baby monitor , with @entity81 taking the woman 's government benefit cards , authorities said			1
" @entity86 and @entity81 forced @entity170 to clean the house , do laundry , walk to the store to do their shopping and care for their numerous pit bulls and reptiles , " the prosecution statement said			2
her child was kept in the apartment when she was sent to the store , they said			0
tuesday 's announcement comes more than a month after the rescue of three women from a @entity16 home where police said a man had held them captive for about a decade			2
authorities believe there is no connection between the @entity15 investigation and that case , the law enforcement source said			1
@entity33 , the federal prosecutor , said tuesday 's arrests are part of a broader push to crack down on what he called " modern - day slavery			1
" " we need your help in these efforts			0
law enforcement can not do it alone			1
all of us in the northern district of @entity5 need to work on being better neighbors , " he said			0
" we need to ask questions , hard questions , when we see something that does n't look right			0
we need to not be afraid to pick up the phone and to call law enforcement			1
we need to not be afraid to ask those simple questions -- is everything ok ? is there some way i can help you ? as @entity276 and as @entity34 , that is who we are , and it is our duty			0
