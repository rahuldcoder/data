-- the 10 - year - old @entity2 girl went to the @entity3 on a prayer of maybe , just maybe , meeting the @entity5 this week to deliver an important message			1
her prayer was answered , against all odds			0
but for a while , @entity10 ' pilgrimage seemed doomed when a bystander pushed the little girl in a pink hat out of the way as the @entity5 approached a @entity3 grandstand filled with supplicants and the faithful			1
" i had to get through a fence , and i was waiting for a long time , " said the 10 - year - old girl from @entity20 , @entity21 , near @entity22			2
" but when @entity26 was getting near me , there was a woman who pushed me because she did n't want me there because @entity26 was coming near			1
so i started to cry because when she pushed me , it did hurt			0
" a @entity30 saw the weeping child and gave her a front - row position to see @entity26			1
pope @entity26 barely saw @entity35 standing eye - high at a white - draped railing			1
the family now has photographs of the extraordinary encounter between their small daughter and the people 's @entity5 , who 's increasingly shown a penchant to enter a crowd and mingle			1
it was then that @entity35 delivered a message that she had carried for more than 6,300 miles			0
" i told him , ' please help my family because we are suffering and my dad is suffering deportation and it 's not fair			1
other children are suffering because their parents are getting separated , ' " @entity10 recounted			1
she was referring to how @entity2 immigration policy -- a vexing issue that has left @entity61 polarized and gridlocked about how to reform it -- breaks apart families by deporting parents who are undocumented immigrants while allowing their @entity2 - born children to remain in the country , left in the care of relatives or on their own			1
her message on wednesday just happened to be delivered as president @entity70 was about to visit @entity26 at the @entity3			1
in fact , the two leaders discussed immigration reform on thursday , though no formal agreements were made , the @entity3 said			1
@entity35 even gave the @entity5 a simple gift during their chance meeting			1
the offering was a cloth napkin , embroidered with an image of two birds , made by @entity35 's mother			0
the birds represented her mother and father			2
also embroidered on it was a legend : " @entity89 , " it said			0
but that nest is n't complete because her father faces deportation			2
" @entity26 had it in his hand , " she said of the napkin			2
" i told him about my family , and that 's when he blessed me and touched my head			2
" the girl was flanked by chaperones and fellow members of a group called @entity106 ( @entity107 ) , which trekked to the @entity3 to bring attention to @entity2 immigration reform efforts			1
to get the @entity112 - born @entity5 's attention , they carried a banner that stated in @entity114 : " dear pope @entity26 , help us legalize our parents			1
" @entity118 , @entity35 's mother , said she 's so happy that her daughter was able to talk to the @entity5			1
" she told me what happened and what she told the @entity5			2
i am so proud of her and she represents other kids who are in the same situation , " the mother said			0
@entity35 's father , @entity126 , 43 , was arrested in @entity127 , @entity128 , for driving under the influence last september , said @entity131 officials			2
he was later convicted of the charge , officials said			0
at the time , @entity126 was working a construction job , said family attorney @entity134			2
the father was then transferred to @entity136 because there was no @entity131 detention center in @entity128			0
" the police took him into custody and forgot about him for two months , " @entity134 said , " he was recently turned into @entity131 when the police filed the deportation proceedings two weeks ago			0
" @entity134 said he spoke to the judge a week ago and presented the family 's situation			0
the judged asked for the family to post bail of $ 15,000 but the family 's attorney was able to reduce the bond to $ 5,000			0
@entity134 said @entity35 's father was released on bail friday , but the family still faces a legal battle in his ongoing deportation proceedings			1
@entity134 hopes to transfer his case to @entity22 and said mr. @entity126 will be returning home with his family this weekend			0
@entity35 's visit was part of a campaign where 11 immigration activists , plus some relatives , traveled to @entity165 hoping to talk to @entity26 and ask him to speak to @entity70 about immigration reform			1
@entity167 of the @entity168 said archbishop @entity169 has been a big supporter of children like @entity35 and their crusade for reform			0
earlier this year @entity169 relayed more than 1,000 letters to @entity26 from children whose families members were facing deportation or were deported			1
" archbishop @entity169 met @entity10 at the @entity178 and thinks she is poised and articulate and has never met anyone like her , " said @entity167			2
@entity169 helped the group by sending a letter to the @entity3 requesting 17 tickets for the group , so they could have a viewing space wednesday outside the @entity3 , @entity167 said			2
the 17 tickets were granted			0
but @entity35 was lucky enough that she was able to get very close and deliver her message			0
the @entity168 believes that this visit to @entity165 will open a dialogue on how important immigration reform is			1
" @entity35 's story will help see the suffering caused in families by a broken immigration system , " said @entity167			0
the archbishop also posted a comment on his @entity198 page			0
" please keep praying for @entity35 and for all the families who are suffering because of our broken immigration system , " he said			0
@entity35 hopes that her messages will be heard			0
" i am very proud of myself because i already accomplished my mission , that was to talk to him and to please stop deportations because the kids are suffering , " she said .			0
