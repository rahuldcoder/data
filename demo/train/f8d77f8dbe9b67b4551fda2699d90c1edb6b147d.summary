@entity0 -- umbrellas , yellow ribbons , numbered codewords and tangles of phone cords : these are the distinctive sights of the dramatic protest unfolding beneath @entity0 's spectacular skyline			1
here are some of the defining images to have emerged from the days of pro-democracy protest that have rocked the semi-autonomous @entity14 territory , and the reasons behind them			1
the umbrella the key symbol of the protests that have upended @entity0 is the humble umbrella			1
since it was used to shield protesters from the tear gas and pepper spray deployed by police , the umbrella has become a ubiquitous sight on the frontlines , and given the movement its name			1
protesters are bringing in umbrellas in bulk and distributing them for free , sleeping under their shelter and writing slogans on them			2
@entity35 , an assistant professor of law at the @entity36 , said the umbrella was not only functional but had " a certain emblematic resonance in that it 's a symbol of passive resistance			1
" " @entity0 is a city that periodically takes refuge under umbrellas against seasonal typhoons that threaten the city			1
the turmoil is another storm @entity0 is trying to weather , " he said			1
@entity0 artist @entity46 has been generating protest art by running a social media " competition " to create a lasting logo for " the @entity49 " ( the prizes being " justice , democracy and freedom " )			1
he said the way the umbrella was used brought an " enormous feeling of brotherhood			2
" " tank man -- that was one guy standing in front of a tank , " says @entity60			0
" the umbrella represents people working with each other to form a defensive shield			1
if you see a piece of the shield ripped away by the police , it will be replaced by another			2
" it was a strong image with an inherent contrast , he said			0
" it 's a soft thing but it 's also very hard in terms of our determination to win this battle			2
" yellow ribbons yellow ribbons are tied to barricade railings , pinned on shirts , and decorate social media profiles			2
long an emblem of suffrage movements internationally -- particularly tied to women 's suffrage -- they have been adopted by @entity0 's protesters as a symbol of democratic aspiration			1
" not everyone can be there on the front lines , " says @entity60			0
" the ribbon is a way to show your support			0
" black tees the student protesters are mostly dressed in black t - shirts			1
@entity103 has traditionally been worn at the city 's annual protests to mark the @entity107 massacre ; @entity60 says they also represent " sorrow and darkness " regarding the use of force on peaceful demonstrators			1
numbers the protest site reads like a telephone directory of numbers , emblazoned on notes and posters plastered around the streets : 689 , 926 , 8964			0
they also figure heavily in social media posts about the protests			2
the numbers are a form of shorthand common to @entity14 political culture in @entity0 and in mainland @entity14 , explains @entity60			1
in the mainland , he says , due to censorship , " you have to speak in a curveball way			0
there 's a lot of coded words they use because they can not express it directly			2
" although no such censorship exists in @entity0 , the same political shorthand is commonplace , said @entity35			1
dates are often used : # 926 refers to september 26 , when the protests kicked off , # 8964 to the date of the @entity107 crackdown			2
@entity0 chief executive @entity143 , the main target of the protesters ' ire , has his own code : 689			1
it refers to the number of votes he received from @entity0 's 1,200 - strong election committee to rise to office as the territory 's leader			1
" they use it to question his legitimacy because he was voted for by only 689 people in @entity0 , " said @entity60			1
" they call him that to remind people he does n't represent all of us -- there 's 7 million of us here			0
" protesters devoted a bus in a blockaded area to @entity143 , plastering it with messages to the chief executive			0
above the bus 's windshield , the route number was changed to " 689 , " the destination to " @entity176			0
" supplies the protest sites are notably orderly , well - organized and clean			1
volunteers hand out free bottled water , snacks , towels and medicine			0
bananas are dispensed , as are loaves of breads and saltine crackers			0
demonstrators bring carts laden with grocery bags of supplies , which are dispensed for free to whoever needs them			0
trash is sorted into three piles for recycling -- plastic , paper and garbage -- and volunteers patrol with plastic garbage bags to collect trash			0
homemade protection after @entity0 protesters were tear gassed on sunday , many improvised their own protection , using some of the materials circulated by the @entity209 movement			1
solutions included wrapping exposed skin in @entity213 plastic wrap , or using swimming goggles and plastic ponchos			0
charging stations some people that live close to the protests are offering to let protesters charge their cell phones			1
they post signs with their contact numbers if people need to use their power supply			0
volunteers have brought power strips and extra chargers so protesters can stay connected			0
phones have played an invaluable role throughout the protests as information is shared through social media			0
@entity235 rumors that the cell phone network would be shut down sparked a massive rush in @entity0 to download the @entity235 messaging app. the app allows users to message each other without @entity244 or cell data connection			1
the demand has been so great that @entity246 , the ceo of the @entity248 company @entity247 which developed the app , has come out to @entity0 during the protests			1
the protesters are well organized and well prepared , said @entity246			2
" they knew that at some point the cellular networks would be shut down or just be overloaded by number of people in the same place , so they know that @entity258 is a way to remain connected and communicate			0
" with one caveat -- all conversations on @entity261 are public because any user can join the messaging rooms			0
candles are long out of vogue as phones are easy , convenient and a non-fire way of providing light in a massive night gathering			0
photographed from above , the glowing screens of mobile phones held aloft by the sea of protesters ' have created an enduring image of the demonstrators ' solidarity			0
effigies @entity0 chief executive @entity143 has been the main target of the protesters ' anger , with calls for him to resign circulating among the crowds			1
a gigantic , enlarged effigy of @entity143 's head , replete with fangs , has been a distinctive sight on the streets during the protests			2
protesters chant in @entity293 , " step down , step down ! " when they see it			0
anthem the rousing anthem , " do you hear the people sing " from the revolution - themed musical " @entity300 , " has been adopted by the protesters			2
the slogan is painted on a poster hanging from a prominent bridge and has been played by a string quartet on the streets			0
in the musical , the song is sung as @entity310 revolutionaries prepare to rebel against the government .			0

the umbrella has emerged as the defining symbol of @entity0 's democracy protests
it became a symbol of passive resistance after they were used to shield against tear gas
a distinct visual language has emerged , including numbered codewords , black t - shirts
the protesters are *highly* organized and *cooperative* , sharing food , water , electricity supplies
