-- a @entity3 man pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter with the use of a gun tuesday in the shooting death of a man who he claimed sexually abused him as a teen , a prosecutor said			1
the plea comes less than a week before @entity14 ' first - degree murder trial was supposed to start for the slaying of @entity16 , a neighbor from his childhood and a family friend whom @entity14 claims began molesting him when he was 11 years old			1
under the terms of a plea deal , @entity14 , now 32 , faces anywhere from probation to 10 years in prison for shooting the former boy scout leader and local businessman last year in his home in the @entity3 community of @entity29			1
lawyers will return to court april 20 to place a statement of facts on the record before judge @entity35 decides on the final sentence			0
" there 's some relief that we know we wo n't lose him for the rest of his life , but there 's also a lot of anxiety about what the judge is going to do , " said @entity14 ' sister , @entity37			1
" i wo n't have closure until he 's home , " she added			2
" but even when he 's home , it 's still not going to be closure			2
we need to get him into treatment so he can get help			0
i feel like this is only the beginning			0
" since his arrest , @entity14 ' family has waged a tireless campaign to reduce the charges and raise awareness over child sex abuse , earning support from members of the community and giving rise to more sex abuse allegations against @entity16			1
@entity16 used his position as a boy scout troop leader and as active neighborhood father to win the trust of @entity14 and other young boys , @entity37 said			1
he took the boys on camping trips or hikes , gave them alcohol or drugs and molested them , @entity37 alleged			2
the alleged sexual abuse waned as @entity14 grew into adulthood , but @entity16 continued to call him and visit the home where @entity14 lived with his wife and infant daughter			1
the continued contact drove @entity14 to the breaking point , his sister said			2
@entity14 was under the influence of alcohol the night of february 8 , 2009 , when he drove to @entity16 's mobile home with a loaded gun and shot him in front of his wife , @entity90 assistant district attorney @entity89 said			1
the prosecutor said she consulted with the victim 's family and reached what they thought a jury may have found -- that his level of intoxication placed the crime more along the lines of an " emotional decision rather than an intentional first - degree murder			1
" @entity109 said she has received four reports of sexual abuse involving @entity16 , which factored into the decision to strike a plea deal even though she could not prove they were true			1
" when you have other victims coming forward , that does lend credibility to that scenario , " she said			0
" these people have written me letters and said this has happened , and i have no way of showing this has happened , but it has been put out there			0
" the slaying victim 's wife , who lived next door to @entity14 ' family and has known the defendant since he was a child , said she had no reason to doubt his claims of abuse			1
" i love this young man and feel he needs counseling more than anything , " @entity16 's wife said in an e-mail			1
she requested that her name not be published			0
" i can not condone what @entity14 has done , but i do understand it			2
i believe he took the wrong avenue by taking the law into his own hands			0
like most of this community , i do not feel he deserves 50 years in prison			0
unlike most of this community , i feel he should serve some time , but not much			0
" the case , with its suggestions of long - buried secrets , has rocked @entity29 , a former logging community that has become a coastal tourist destination			2
another longtime @entity29 resident has come out publicly with allegations of abuse against @entity16			1
" i was a reserved kid , some considered me a loner ; i just kind of kept to myself as a kid , and he would play on that , " @entity157 said in an interview in march			0
" he 'd give me pot and beer , and he 'd get me stoned and a little drunk , and he took advantage of me that way			0
" @entity157 said the abuse began when he was 15 and continued on and off until he was 19 , but the emotional trauma lingered for years , driving him to substance abuse and suicide attempts			0
he said he brought the allegations to @entity171 in 2001 but nothing happened			0
" all those years , i wanted to forget about and push it away with alcohol because you 're supposed to be a man			0
and then , when police did n't do anything , that pushed me even further down the hole			0
" repeated calls for comment to the @entity183 and the @entity184 , which handled the investigation of @entity16 's death , were not returned			1
@entity157 said his ability to stay sober for more than two years braced him for news of @entity16 's death			1
" when i got news that he 'd been shot , the first thing i thought was , ' who got him ? somebody got him			0
who else did he do it to ? ' " @entity16 's second wife , @entity195 , who divorced him in 1980 , said she also went to @entity171 in the 1990s after she was told that her ex-husband had sexually abused her son years ago			1
" it could 've been stopped a long time ago but the police did n't take me seriously when i reported it because they said the statute of limitations was up by the time i found out what happened to my son , " @entity195 said in a phone interview tuesday			0
@entity195 said she has long felt indifference toward her ex-husband but worried about the effects of his death and the abuse allegations were having on their children , now adults			1
" it 's hard for them to cope because they 're friends with @entity14 , they knew him , " said @entity195			2
" @entity16 's their father and he 's their friend			1
they 're having a hard time separating their father from the pedophile			0
" members of the community also expressed shock that a " normal " guy like @entity16 , a small business owner who installed the blinds in your home after you bought them at his furniture store , was capable of such horrific acts right under their noses			2
" here we have this man , and he 's being the normal , small - town businessman , and he 's following all the cultural paths available and all the norms , so when you have people coming forward and saying this man is doing something to me that 's outside the norm , there 's a tendency to not listen closely or to ignore it , " said @entity234 , a hospital employee who has lived in @entity29 most of his life			2
" i guess we are to blame in a way , for thinking that this could never happen in our town			0

@entity14 was set to stand trial for first - degree murder next week in @entity16 's death
@entity14 says @entity16 molested him as a teen , emotionally tormented him as an adult
many in community support @entity14 ; other adult men say @entity16 abused them as children
