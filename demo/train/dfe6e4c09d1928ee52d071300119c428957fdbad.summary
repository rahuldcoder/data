-- as a frequent flier i have a laundry list of complaints about the process of flying , and that list has just been made longer by the @entity7			1
my biggest complaints used to include flight staff who do n't enforce carry - on restrictions and the people who stow their enormous carry - on baggage sideways			1
but these pale in comparison to the @entity7 's new measures			1
these represent another episode in the pointless frustration show that the @entity7 puts on to make us feel as though we 're safe			1
this month the @entity7 introduced full - body scans that are little more than the realization of the back - of - the - comic - book fantasy of x-ray specs			2
these new full - body scans will do nothing for our security , nor will the invasive pat downs that will be waiting for those who refuse the scans			0
opinion : what if we had no air security checks even before the backscatter x-ray machines roll out to all the airports in @entity34 ( they are in 70 airports so far ) , i am actively looking for people to make a bet with me about the future of these machines			1
specifically , i will bet that we will catch more @entity7 employees guilty of inappropriately forwarding full - body scans of celebrities or attractive women than we will terrorists			2
additionally , i think i speak for all travelers when i wonder why we have full - body scans , yet will still have to put our shoes through the x-ray machine			0
if the @entity7 is going to have an x-ray photo of my private parts , i would hope that this sacrifice of personal freedom would at least allow me the luxury of wearing my shoes through the metal detector			2
ultimately , the truth is that the @entity7 has done little or nothing to keep our skies safer than they were before 9/11			1
a quick look back at recent history reveals that in the years since 9/11 our best anti-terrorism efforts have come from brave , average civilians on flights			2
the shoe bomber and the @entity67 bomber were both brought down by average citizens , not the @entity7 or their ridiculous policies			1
i understand that the @entity7 is not implementing these measures to punish fliers , but rather doing everything in its power to prevent a terrorist attack on an airplane			1
i commend their mission , but i do not commend the directions they are taking to achieve it			0
sadly , the @entity7 is engaged in the same game as the @entity82 -- that is trying to solve a problem retroactively			1
the frightening truth is that the people who use drugs in sports and the terrorists intent on destruction will always be one step ahead of the slow , bureaucratic agencies in charge of policing them			0
the doping agency ca n't test for a steroid until it knows it exists			0
in much the same way , the @entity7 can not adequately respond to a terrorist threat until it knows it exists			2
sadly , the only way to know it exists is when someone fails in his attempt to do damage			0
more opinion on topics in the news for example , the @entity7 allows us 3 ounces of liquid on a domestic flight			0
so , presumably , if terrorists wanted to get , say , 12 ounces of dangerous liquid through security , they would have to go through the difficult process of booking four tickets			0
these measures are ultimately nothing more than a show to make us feel more secure			0
the truth is that the security of flights will be determined by the level of competency of our intelligence services and the bravery of average @entity34 , not by a silly scan and a ban on water bottles			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity132 .			0

@entity132 says new @entity7 measures make his other flying complaints pale by comparison
he says they wo n't work ; besides , post- 9/11 terror tries were *thwarted* by *passengers*
@entity7 strategy *similar* to sports *anti-doping* : tries to solve a problem retroactively
@entity132 : security depends on competence of intelligence services , average @entity34
