@entity0 -- with @entity3 meeting this week in @entity0 to discuss the war in @entity5 , @entity1 reached out to some everyday @entity5 - @entity6 to see what they think			1
what should be the next step ? what do they hope will result from the summit ? and what is the key to restoring peace after 10 years of bloodshed ? here are five perspectives from @entity5 who live in different areas of the @entity20			1
@entity21 owns a restaurant in northwest @entity0			1
he is from @entity23 in northern @entity5			2
" i was ( in @entity5 ) in 2002 , 2004 , 2007 and just last november			2
every year , it gets worse			0
people are upset , people are suffering			1
... both sides ( are ) losing life			0
" the war is not the solution			2
there is no way you can win the war by this kind of force			0
@entity3 has so many mistakes in @entity5			1
on the other side , suicide ( bombers ) , innocent people died			0
" ( i 'm hopeful ) , but at this summit i do n't think @entity3 is going to pull out from @entity5			1
" @entity45 is author of " @entity46 : the @entity47			0
" he is from @entity49 , @entity5 , 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) southwest of @entity50			2
" ( under @entity3 ) , a few roads have been built , no doubt			2
but come on , these are nothing compared to the $ 500 billion we supposedly spent in @entity5			2
" the solution ( to the war ) is an indigenous peace process			1
i call it the indigenous peace jurga			0
these are jurgas at the village level , at the district level , at the province level , at the zonal level all over @entity5			2
they include tribal leaders , they include insurgents and ( foreign - educated @entity5 expatriates )			1
let us lead the peace process			1
" @entity73 owns a jewelry store on @entity0 's north side			2
" all the companies ( @entity3 ) hires , who owns the companies ? @entity6 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83			1
why do n't you hire @entity5 ? if you want to stop them from war , give them jobs			1
... " my family , we have a lot of kids , no school			0
we need good schools , we need a system			0
" @entity96 is a network engineer originally from @entity50			0
" there 's been certain progress , there are schools built			0
but at the same time , what they promised was stability and peace			0
after years of war , they have n't done as promised			2
" if @entity3 pulls out , there will be civil war , there will be anarchy			1
if they do n't , the violence will continue			0
" @entity3 needs to focus on @entity83 , not @entity5			1
@entity83 is where the @entity113 came from and where support ( for it ) comes from			0
( @entity3 ) needs to have a greater debate that involves regional powers like @entity83 , @entity119 and @entity120 , which still has influence			0
" @entity122 is executive director of the @entity123 , a nonprofit based in @entity0			0
she is originally from @entity50			0
" there is a lot of money floating around ( in @entity5 )			0
however , i believe the money should be spent to help the people of @entity5 with education / schools , job development , health care and child care			1
" it is vital that the people of @entity5 develop skills and obtain the tools to move past 2014 and work independently toward the betterment of @entity5			1
with the proper funding and tools available to the people , i trust that @entity5 can improve after 2014 and the lives of innocent @entity5 would be spared			1
