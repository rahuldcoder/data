-- it is the question that has followed @entity3 for the past four years , the answer to which will not truly be known until the final for the men 's 100 meters sprint in @entity7 has been done and dusted			1
just how fast could he have run on that night in @entity9 ? it seems a crazy thing to ask			0
after all , the @entity12 smashed the world record with a time of 9.69 seconds , winning gold and saving the @entity17 ' marquee sport from itself after successive drug scandals			2
and he has run faster since , setting a new record a year later at the @entity21 with a time of 9.58 seconds			2
more : artist turns @entity3 into street hero but @entity9 was much more than a world record			1
it was the manner of his victory that catapulted him into the kind of international fame not seen in track and field since the @entity35 @entity17 legend @entity34			1
not only did he blow the rest of the field away , he cantered across the line with 20 meters to go , chest turned to the cameras , arms wide open			0
a new hero other athletes past and present , not to mention the @entity46 president , derided his showmanship			0
but the public had made their mind up			0
they had a new hero			0
" my one aim was just to be a champion			0
that is what i came here to do , " @entity3 , then 21 , said after the race			1
" i told you i was going to be number one and i did just that ... it was crazy , phenomenal			0
" ever since he has rightly been heralded as the greatest sprinter of all time			0
but the celebration and the criticism left that one question hanging in the air			0
just how fast could he have run ? the press , coaches and fellow athletes all speculated			0
the trainer credited with @entity3 's rise , @entity75 , suggested that he could have run under 9.6 seconds			1
the @entity78 's @entity77 , which deemed the issue of such importance that it dedicated some of the finest minds on the planet to the quandary , predicted that he would have run 9.55 seconds			2
now all the talk is of this sunday 's 100m final at @entity88			1
is 9.4 possible ? @entity3 could become the first sprinter since @entity34 to defend an @entity17 100m title			1
but no one is talking about 9.69 , 9.58 or 9.55			0
now @entity3 is looking at breaking the record again and seeing if the human body can be pushed further , through the 9.4 second barrier			1
" everyone has been talking about 9.4 all season , " @entity3 explained in an interview with @entity0 in july , when asked whether he could run that time at @entity88			2
" if it 's possible i am the one			2
" one study by @entity101 mathematicians at @entity102 concluded that , theoretically , @entity3 's dream could be realized			1
" according to our results this is achievable , " the co-author of the report @entity106 said in an interview with @entity108			0
" the absolute limit for a world record at the moment is 9.36 seconds , " he added			2
the theory , along with @entity3 's rhetoric , sounds fine			1
but the reality is that @entity3 comes into the @entity17 having struggled with injuries this season and seen a genuine threat to his title emerge in the shape of training partner @entity123			1
" he [ @entity3 ] has had some problems this year , " 200m @entity17 champion @entity124 told @entity0 's @entity125 this month			1
" but he can still run two tenths ( of a second ) quicker than anyone else ... he does n't need to be 100 per cent			0
" winning would be enough of an achievement , one that would bookend and incredible four years since his record run in @entity9			2
that run transformed @entity3 's life			1
he is now mobbed wherever he goes , adorns billboards from @entity137 to @entity138 and has written his first autobiography			0
as former @entity17 gold medalist @entity140 remarked during a recent interview with @entity3 for @entity0 , the @entity12 is the most famous athlete , not just in the world , but of all time			2
where it began @entity3 's journey began , like many other world record sprinters , in the @entity12 district of @entity150 where other greats such as current @entity17 women 's 200m champion @entity152 also have roots			1
although he was @entity156 , @entity155 was also born here			0
it is an area famed for breeding sprint stars thanks largely to a fiercely contested four - day race championships where crowds of up to 30,000 fill the national stadium in @entity162			2
over a million people watch the young sprint hopefuls live on tv for what is often the springboard towards the @entity17			0
" i feel we push our young athletes , " @entity3 told @entity0 when asked why @entity12 produces so much sprinting talent earlier this year			2
" there is this thing called the @entity173 in @entity12 , which showcases the talent			0
the level of competition is really high because it pushes you every day to be the best in your event , in your class			0
" @entity3 came on to the sprint world 's radar at the @entity182 when , at just 16 , he posted times in the 200 and 400m good enough for the @entity17 finals in @entity185 three years earlier			1
going pro he went pro a year later but his failure in the 200m at the @entity189 helped him to recalibrate his life and focus on his training			0
coach @entity192 eventually allowed @entity3 to run the 100m too , a discipline seen as too difficult for a man the size of @entity3 ( he is six foot three inches tall ) to excel in			1
it was a path that would take him to his coronation in @entity9 , where he also won gold in the 200m and 4x100m relay in world record times			0
yet four years on and the task of becoming only the second man -- after @entity34 -- to retain the 100m @entity17 title has become far harder than many people thought it would be			1
many expected @entity3 to dominate the games for years to come			2
but the emergence of his compatriot @entity123 -- who beat @entity3 in both the 100 and 200m at the @entity12 @entity17 trials this year -- has added the one ingredient needed in any classic final : a genuine rival that could prevent him from equaling @entity34 's record			1
" we 're training partners so we 're really close , " @entity3 says of @entity123 , who won the 2011 world 100m title after his compatriot 's false start in the final			1
" we laugh even when we 're warming up			0
we 're cool but as soon we 're getting on the track line up it 's a different story			0
" in 1988 @entity34 had his own fierce rival from @entity150 : @entity124			2
@entity34 famously came second in the @entity228 final and only became the first man to win back - to - back @entity17 100m titles by default after @entity124 failed a drugs test			1
@entity34 was handed the medal in his hotel			2
a rival to @entity34 @entity34 is sceptical that @entity3 could match his achievement			1
" @entity34 is totally preoccupied by @entity3 and sees him not as a successor but as a rival to his legacy , " says author @entity237 , who recently wrote a book about the 1988 final called " @entity239 in @entity240			1
" " when i asked him about @entity245 he said , ' it will be really tough for him , no one has defended an @entity17 title before			0
' @entity237 pointed out to him that he had , technically , defended his 100m title at @entity228 and @entity34 corrected himself : ' i said no one else but me ! ' " @entity3 and @entity123 have none of the enmity that @entity34 and @entity124 had , but if @entity3 can defend his @entity9 title then it would surely stand above @entity34 ' achievements , simply because that second gold medal in @entity228 was won in such unprecedented circumstances			1
" there 's no way to describe it			0
for me it is amazing to think that i am faster than everybody , " @entity3 said when asked how it feels to be the fastest man in the world			2
the worry for @entity3 is that @entity123 is n't his only rival			1
@entity35 sprinter @entity266 has run the second fastest time ever			0
the 2004 @entity17 champion @entity267 , also from the @entity35 , is returning after a doping ban while fellow @entity12 @entity269 once held the world record himself			0
anyone of them could snatch gold if @entity3 's injury problems are worse than his bravado suggests			1
that tongue in cheek bravado might have helped make @entity3 such a star ; but the @entity12 is not afraid to show a more serious side when he talks about the sprint challenge ahead			1
" all i can say , " @entity3 told @entity0 last month , " ( is ) @entity281 , let 's go if you want a piece of me			1
" four years later , under the intense pressure only an @entity17 100m final can bring , we may finally know how fast bolt really can run			1
the stage is set for for the most eagerly awaited track event at an @entity17			0
and no one , even given the talk of injuries , should discount that come sunday , the world would have witnessed the fastest race in history too .			0

@entity3 could make history during this *weekend* 's 100m final
he *'d* match @entity34 ' record of back - to - back 100m titles
but he has friend @entity123 hot on his heels
could either one of them break the 9.4s barrier ?
