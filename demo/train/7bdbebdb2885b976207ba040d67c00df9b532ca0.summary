a phenomenal thing has happened in @entity2 : progressive advocates and conservative forces have united around legislative action supported by the strong majority of the @entity8 people			1
groups as disparate as the @entity10 and @entity11 on the left and the @entity13 on the right ; @entity16 sen. @entity15 and @entity18 sen. @entity17 ; and over two - thirds of the @entity8 people all support major overhauls to @entity8 's criminal justice system			1
as do , presumably , the 2.2 million @entity8 ensnared in our nation 's costly and counterproductive current prison system			1
so what 's stopping reform ? one man : @entity28			1
@entity28 is the senior @entity16 senator from @entity29			1
he was first elected to @entity30 in 1975 , serving first in the @entity31 before going to the @entity32 in 1981			2
that means @entity28 's been in @entity30 long enough to have been there when the idea of mandatory minimum sentences for federal criminal convictions was first introduced			1
in the 1980s , @entity30 passed so - called " mandatory minimums " as part of the national war on drugs , supposedly to make it easier to keep traffickers and kingpins locked up			0
yet by basically any measure , mandatory minimums have been a maximal failure			0
yes , nationwide the crime rate has declined in the past 40 years			0
but a new study confirms that @entity8 's drop in crime had very little , if anything , to do with mandatory sentencing laws and the increase in incarceration			1
for instance , while incarceration played a small role -- estimated at around 5 % -- in the drop of crime rates between 1990 and 1999 , it had ostensibly no effect between 2000 and 2013			0
meanwhile the federal prison population has grown from 20,000 prisoners in the 1980s to over 200,000 prisoners today			0
with states also passing mandatory sentencing laws , the prison population overall has skyrocketed			0
today , the @entity8 has more people behind bars than any other country in the world			1
one out of every 100 adult @entity8 is in prison or jail			1
and the laws have had a disproportionately harsh effect on communities of color			2
for instance , on average , black male offenders are given sentences 20 % higher than white males			2
meanwhile federal prisons are overcrowded by 40 % , and incarceration costs eat up 25 % of the @entity86 's budget			0
the federal government could be investing more in public infrastructure jobs and higher education , since employment and education have proved to decrease crime rates dramatically			0
instead , politicians are slashing food stamps and public assistance funding while spending $ 29,000 per year per inmate in federal lockup			0
and as the conservative writer @entity103 wrote in @entity104 , " when @entity99 and @entity100 both think the same bill is a good idea , you might think it would have legs			0
" yet it would appear @entity28 just does n't wan na change the rules			1
@entity28 is the chair of the @entity109			1
simply put , given the generally powerful position of committee chairs on @entity112 , if @entity28 does n't want reform to happen , it wo n't			1
this past may , @entity28 gave a floor speech voicing his strong opposition to the " @entity116			2
" @entity28 connected @entity8 's drop in crime over the past decades partly to the use of mandatory minimum sentences			1
citing a year when the number of state and federal prisoners had dropped , @entity28 argued there was a corresponding rise in crime despite other contradictory evidence			2
@entity128 , @entity28 said , " the only tool @entity30 has to make sure that federal judges do not abuse their discretion in sentencing too leniently is mandatory minimum sentences			1
" in @entity28 's world , the war on drugs is working and mandatory minimum laws are a tool for combating liberal activist judges			1
given such illogical conclusions , one might jokingly ask whether @entity28 is crusading against drugs or using too much of them himself			2
but to anyone paying attention , what seems illogical is @entity28 's ability to stand in the way of a strong bipartisan coalition of his colleagues and the overwhelming weight of factual evidence and public support			2
it 's yet another reason @entity2 seems so dysfunctional			0
it 's one thing when one party in the majority passes , say , health care reform and then the other party stubbornly votes over and over again -- over 50 times -- to repeal the law			2
that 's undeniably pointless and absurd but can at least be chalked up to petulant partisanship			0
yet here we have that rarest of species in @entity2 , agreement -- and in alignment with facts and popular opinion			0
the idea hat one person can stand in the way is insane			0
this is n't what our @entity172 had in mind			0
this is n't a checks - and - balances democracy			0
it 's more like a monarchy , where @entity28 is king			2
over 2 million @entity8 may continue to waste away in our bloated and broken prison system , and more will probably join them , merely because the way @entity30 does business gives so much power to committee chairs such as @entity28			1
until there 's a way around that , @entity2 will seem broken , too .			0

@entity188 and right have united against harsh @entity8 minimum sentences
