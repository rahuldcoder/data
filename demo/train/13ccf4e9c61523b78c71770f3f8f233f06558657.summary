-- we arrived in @entity3 's capital city , @entity4 , on january 22 , a four - person emergency assessment team rapidly deployed by @entity6			1
with violence raging throughout the country as @entity10 and @entity3 forces fought to take back control of areas seized by @entity14 rebels earlier this month , we had no time to waste			1
fighting had already displaced more than 10,000 people by the time we arrived ( an estimated 25,000 to date ) , adding to the more than 460,000 @entity3 who fled their homes because of violence in 2012			1
even before january 10 , more than 2 million @entity3 were at risk of food insecurity and an estimated 1.5 million at risk of epidemics , according to the @entity24 @entity23			1
in this dire humanitarian and volatile security context , we immediately began advancing north to reach areas affected by the latest conflict and assess the most urgent humanitarian needs on the ground			1
@entity3 , particularly the northern part of the country , poses enormous challenges for organizations seeking to help those who need it			1
humanitarian access is extremely limited , making the presence of relief and aid agencies very sparse , despite vast need			2
we have faced tremendous challenges traveling through conflict - affected areas : strict military checkpoints , impassable roads and rivers , unpredictable security dynamics , and , worst of all , the ever - present possibility of scattered @entity14 rebels along the route			0
but we 're working together with local authorities , @entity24 agencies and nongovernmental organization partners to gain access to previously unreachable areas and ensure that critical health and nutrition needs are being met			1
on january 28 , local authorities granted our team access to the town of @entity60 to conduct the first humanitarian assessment there			0
we had only four hours to get in and out			0
@entity60 was the first town captured when armed @entity14 rebels who control northern @entity3 began aggressively moving south on january 10 , triggering @entity10 military intervention			2
beginning with airstrikes on january 11 , @entity10 and @entity3 military forces fought intensely against the @entity14 rebels in @entity60 for more than a week , forcing many of the town 's residents to flee their homes			2
@entity10 and @entity3 forces retook @entity60 from the rebels on january 18			2
most of the town 's residents had returned by the time we were allowed in to assess critical needs , and life was beginning to return to normal			0
but there were still many signs of the conflict			0
the road leading into the town was littered with burned - out pickup trucks and shrapnel			0
we even found an unexploded bomb in one home we visited , quickly warning the family of 17 to stay clear before reporting the bomb to the @entity10 military to be rendered safe			0
similar threats of unexploded ordinances and remnants of @entity14 rebels will persist throughout @entity3 , even as military operations begin to wind down			2
we met with community leaders to discuss @entity60 's most urgent needs , involving all sectors of the community , including the mayor , women 's groups , local health associations and youth groups			2
we also visited homes to see firsthand the household - level impact of the conflict			0
hunger and food insecurity are major concerns in @entity60 and throughout @entity3			2
@entity60 's market was closed for a month because of instability in the region , cutting off access to food and compromising many people 's livelihoods			0
the town 's school remains closed , but health and nutrition services have started reopening with the support of local @entity124			0
we 're now on our way to @entity126 , which was just retaken by @entity10 and @entity3 troops			1
@entity126 is one of the three northern regions controlled by @entity14 rebel groups since an april 2012 coup that effectively split @entity3 into two			1
thousands of displaced families are expected to be returning home in the coming days , likely overwhelming critical services that have been weakened since being cut off from the world 10 months ago			1
we 've heard reports that the rebels looted health clinics , damaging and even destroying some			0
many doctors and nurses have fled south or across the border to @entity142 , leaving limited support for the local population			1
as soon as we gain access to @entity126 , we 'll conduct rapid assessments of its health facilities to determine the most pressing needs before initiating emergency response activities to provide staff , equipment and medication			1
we 'll also assess the town 's nutrition and water needs , sharing our findings with @entity24 agencies and @entity124 partners to facilitate a coordinated humanitarian response			0
after @entity126 , we 'll continue north , heading deep into formerly rebel - held territoryâ € ” areas @entity124 have been cut off from for monthsâ € ” to reach those most in need			1
to help us help the estimated 4.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in @entity3 , donate to our emergency response fund			0
