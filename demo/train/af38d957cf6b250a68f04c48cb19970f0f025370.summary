-- when you hear " trick or treat " this year , think " nudge			2
" from economists who study how we actually behave , as opposed to how we 're supposed to behave , " nudge " is shorthand for the growing body of research showing how small design changes in supermarkets , schools , offices and homes can lead to meaningful behavior changes			1
help ca n't arrive soon enough			1
with @entity16 generating $ 2.5 billion in candy sales , candy dishes are filling up fast			1
confronted by thousands of new calorie missiles staring at us from our desks and break rooms , we usually try two ways to manage risk			2
first , we hope once again to exert self - control and willpower , believing that the hyper - rational part of our mind can win out over the weaker devil within us that really wants that miniature chocolate bar to fill the midafternoon lull			1
@entity31 and @entity32 are economists whose work shows this approach is a loser			1
we are , in @entity31 's words , " predictably irrational			2
" absent a nudge , what we are supposed to do and what we really do are two different things			2
which brings us to the second option : someone attempts to pass a new rule banning candy , birthday cakes and cookies			1
from babies to @entity51 , no one likes to have choices taken away			2
just ask the @entity53 , which has found itself on the losing side of the " bake sale battles			0
" nudges represent a third way forward , where we change the conditions in which we live , work and play			1
as a result of these design changes , we make different and healthier choices -- unconsciously , in most cases			1
nudge solutions acknowledge our frailty : that we are n't likely to make the smart choice on our own			1
yet these innovations avoid the policy and political fights that come with @entity72 - style soda bans			0
5 scary good healthy @entity16 treats in a new book , " @entity75 : mindless eating solutions for @entity82 , " @entity76 , director of @entity78 's @entity77 , lays out all kinds of practical nudge solutions			1
" becoming slim by design works better than trying to become slim by willpower , " @entity76 writes			1
" it 's easier to change your eating environment than to change your mind			0
" let 's start with that office candy dish , an armory for @entity16 treats			1
" the most dangerous candy dish is one that is close , clear and chocolaty , " according to @entity76 's hidden - camera monitoring of office workers			1
here 's where design matters			1
when the candy dish is within easy reach , just beyond the keyboard , workers eat an average of nine pieces of candy per day			1
putting the candy dish in a desk drawer cuts consumption to an average of three pieces per day			1
@entity76 saw similar reductions with the candy dish placed on a table top at least 6 feet away			1
while nudge solutions can help us manage our personal candy battles , the real impact occurs when school cafeterias and other large institutions adopt the practices			2
without removing any junk food or banning any items , @entity76 and his colleagues have tested nudge solutions in real school lunchroom settings			0
fruit consumption more than doubled			0
more kids picked white milk over sugary drinks			0
simply changing the names of some of the items and switching the order of menu options on the lunch line led to healthier choices			0
they managed all this without any fights over what kind of food would be available			0
chocolate milk , which contains more sugar , is a sore point for some nutrition directors			0
@entity76 reports that when schools ban chocolate milk , fewer kids drank milk at all			0
more of them took white milk but threw it away			0
and some kids stopped eating lunch , due to the hassle			0
" when we make chocolate milk less convenient , even simply putting white milk in the front of the cooler and chocolate in back , sales increase by 30 to 40 percent			0
no front - page stories creating movie - ready bad guys out of well - meaning local dietitians			0
" all this promising news can be hard for traditional advocacy leaders wedded to nutrition strategies that attempt to hammer a rational food orthodoxy into our collective consciousness			2
but challenging the status quo is a good thing			0
the 2009 book , " nudge : improving decisions about @entity178 , " by @entity179 and @entity180 , makes the case why nonprofit organizations , foundations and government agencies should replace stale program strategies with more promising nudge innovations			0
the only certainty is that willpower and prohibition have not worked so far , and there 's no reason to believe we will become predictably rational			2
so let the nudging begin			0
join us on @entity190 / @entity189 .			0

as @entity16 approaches , the lure of the office candy dish grows
@entity195 says the traditional approach of *relying* on willpower does n't work
studies have shown that design changes can affect behavior more *effectively* , he says
