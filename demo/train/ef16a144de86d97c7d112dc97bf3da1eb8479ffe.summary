-- the debate over what is happening inside @entity3 should now end			2
a new report by three veteran war crimes prosecutors , released exclusively by @entity0 and @entity6 , offers what appears to be irrefutable evidence of systemic war crimes by the regime of @entity3 president @entity11			1
any fair observer can no longer doubt the prosecutors ' findings of " the smoking gun " of widespread crimes against humanity			0
@entity3 human rights activists have long been documenting cases of methodical torture and execution carried out by members of the @entity3 regime			1
organizations such as @entity25 have also documented shocking crimes from their own independent investigations			0
but none of these efforts has managed to capture the essence of what is really taking place in @entity3 as much as the new report authored by @entity34 and @entity35 , chief prosecutors of the war crimes tribunal for @entity38 , and @entity39 , lead prosecutor against former @entity42 president @entity41			2
although their report relies solely on a low - ranking member of the @entity11 regime , the accompanying evidence of 55,000 horrific photographs documenting the death of more than 11,000 detainees constitutes overwhelming proof			1
opinion : @entity3 shows peril of @entity55 's growing power as @entity34 said , " this is direct evidence of the regime 's killing machine			1
" now there can be little denying that the violent campaign orchestrated by the @entity11 regime is indeed tantamount to genocide			1
with close to 130,000 deaths , 2 million refugees in neighboring countries and more than 5 million internally displaced victims , @entity3 's civil war has indeed evolved as a reaction to a campaign of mass murder and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the @entity11 regime in mid- 2011 to quash the largely peaceful protest movement			1
some in the @entity72 may stand behind the @entity11 regime even today , and many elements from the country 's minorities , including the @entity76 to which the @entity11 family belong , work with the opposition , but the sectarian character of the struggle and the relevance of the @entity84 divide must be recognized			1
the overwhelming majority of victims are from an @entity88 @entity84 background			0
the @entity76 fear blowback should the regime collapse			0
the @entity11 regime has long survived by manipulating the fears and concerns of the country 's minorities , relying on members of the @entity76 community to control the levers of power within state institutions , especially military and security , and portraying itself as a protector of minorities			2
change , many fear , might bring a backlash against them			0
now , after close to three years of bloodshed , a systematic campaign of terror and mayhem ( with mainly @entity84 victims ) -- and with the emergence of extremist groups , including @entity113 , among the rebels -- minorities who fear that a rebel victory will subject them to revenge appear justified			0
the political process needed at this stage must aim to end the ongoing genocide and hold its masterminds accountable			0
only then can there be meaningful talks about ending @entity113 's presence , especially after new revelations that @entity128 intelligence agencies have detected signs of cooperation between the @entity11 regime and @entity113 's @entity3 affiliates in their fight against moderate rebels			1
as the parties meet soon in @entity136 to discuss a solution to @entity3 's crisis , balancing the needs of the country 's various minorities should come at the expense of neither the aspirations of pro-democracy advocates nor the demands for justice			1
meanwhile , equating a systematic and premeditated campaign of terror that exploited the full might of the state with random violations committed by rebel groups ( who often fail to coordinate their activities , even as they fight in the same neighborhoods ) will serve to make reaching a viable agreement well - nigh impossible			0
true , war criminals need to be brought to justice no matter to which camp they belong , but we should not be surprised if the majority came from the ranks of the @entity11 regime			1
nor should we be loath to holding @entity11 himself accountable			0
those who propose giving @entity11 and his top commanders ' immunity from prosecution to get to a cease - fire agreement forget that , with so many victims and the country 's growing communal divides , there is an immediate need for justice			1
only then can serious work on rebuilding inter-communal bridges truly begin			0
the images of the 11,000 detainees who died in @entity11 's concentration camps cry out for simple justice , not oblivion			2
they demand that we hold the criminals accountable , not for sweeping the truth under the rug			0
achieving this may not be convenient , but it is necessary , both for strategic and moral reasons			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 and @entity190 .			2

@entity189 , @entity190 : report appears to show proof of @entity3 regime torture
they say the regime 's violence is tantamount to genocide ; @entity11 has sown sectarian war
they say @entity136 goal must be : end killing , bring *guilty* to justice , especially in regime
writers : @entity209 should not get immunity ; rebuilding @entity3 society needs accountability
