-- in a presidential primary season distinguished so far by the absence of substantive debates , the controversy over whether @entity2 and his partners at @entity4 should be considered job creators or job destroyers raises a profoundly important issue			1
beyond the concerns about the loss of @entity14 jobs to off - shoring or automation and the food - fight tactics of @entity2 's rivals is a legitimate question about what kind of capitalism 21st century @entity14 should want			1
the choice is between " stakeholder capitalism " and " shareholder capitalism			1
" according to the theory of stakeholder capitalism , corporations are and should be quasi-public entities with responsibilities to the nation - state and to the communities in which they are embedded			2
the corporation should make a profit and provide a fair return to investors			0
at the same time , workers who contribute their labor to the company have a legitimate interest in it as well as investors who provide capital			0
managers serve the company and the country , not merely the investors			0
in the theory of " shareholder capitalism , " the corporation exists solely for the purpose of the investors , whom the managers serve as agents			2
in shareholder capitalism , short - term profits are the only goal , and if that means laying off workers instead of retraining them or reassigning them , breaking up the company and selling the assets to enrich private equity partners and shareholders , so be it			2
the stakeholder conception of the firm is still the norm in @entity62 and @entity63 , as it was in mid- 20th century @entity14			1
but beginning in the 1970s , the shareholder conception of capitalism prevailed in the @entity14			2
from the perspective of shareholder theory , private equity firms like @entity2 's are promoting efficiency , even as they make short - term profits by dismantling or destroying companies and laying off their workers			0
from the different perspective of stakeholder capitalism , the emphasis on short - term profits for investors at the expense of all other considerations , including the well - being of employees and local communities , has been a tragic mistake			0
what are the implications ? if @entity14 continues to favor shareholder capitalism , there is no guarantee that policies to favor @entity14 business will preserve or create jobs or help anyone other than investors			1
on the other hand , if the @entity14 were to move away from shareholder capitalism toward stakeholder capitalism , the law might limit hostile takeovers of companies or require workers and even local governments to have a say in corporate decisions			1
in some cases this might preserve jobs and factories at the expense of innovation and efficiency			0
as a practitioner of the shareholder capitalism of the last generation , @entity2 as president would probably support policies that assume that the short - term interests of investors like @entity4 are identical to the long - term interests of the economy			1
by the same token , he would probably resist policies that increased the influence of managers , workers and local communities over companies at the expense of shareholders and financiers			0
nominated as secretary of defense by president @entity134 in 1953 , former @entity130 ceo @entity129 , a symbol of old - fashioned stakeholder capitalism , told the @entity135 that " i thought what was good for the country was good for @entity130 and vice versa			2
" does @entity2 , today 's symbol of shareholder capitalism , believe that what is good for @entity4 is good for @entity14 ? if he wins his party 's nomination and this year 's presidential election , @entity14 will find out			1
