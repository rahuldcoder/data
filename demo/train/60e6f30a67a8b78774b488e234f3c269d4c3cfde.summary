finding the most famous chimpanzees in the world is a task that would test the most intrepid of explorers			2
reaching the picturesque hinterland of @entity6 in @entity7 is just the start			1
a two - hour boat ride across the vast waters of @entity11 follows			0
finally , we disembark and begin to trek through the dense forests of @entity6 for a further hour before the chimps in question are finally glimpsed			1
peering through branches towards the canopies , we spy a mother and her two young boys feasting on palm nuts			0
it was close to this spot in 1960 that the @entity23 , the @entity24 primatologist widely regarded as the world 's foremost expert on chimpanzees , began her near 55 - year study of one specially selected chimp family			1
@entity23 , now 80 years old , would sit for hours and observe the complex social structures and interactions of her subjects			1
the research of that one family and the subsequent generations it has spawned continues to this day , providing ever more fascinating insights into the behavior of the closest living relatives of human beings			0
the magic of @entity6 " the magic of @entity6 is two factors , " said @entity43 , a phd candidate at the @entity44 , here to study the chimps			1
" it 's the opportunity to be here with a well - habituated group of chimpanzees , to come into the forest every day with knowledgeable field assistants			1
it 's ( also ) the long term data , because @entity23 started this study in the early 60s			1
" " we have this incredible opportunity to know the chimps here now , and also their mothers and fathers and their grandmothers and all this incredible information that we have on them			2
" researchers like @entity43 come from all over the world to study the chimps at @entity6			1
there are an estimated 100 chimpanzees there today , broken up into three different communities			2
the group @entity23 studied has the most , with around 60 members			1
meat eaters even after 50 - plus years , researchers are still surprised by what they learn			2
before the program began , chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but @entity23 saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat			1
this is a trait we observe as we watch a group of chimps track @entity87 monkeys swinging in the trees above them			1
we also see another industrious bunch fashion tools to try dislodge termites from beneath a mound			0
according to senior researcher at the @entity97 , dr @entity98 , activities like these display a high level of intelligence			0
" they 're so much like humans			0
there are so many similarities in what they do , the relationships they have to each other , just all kinds of ways , there are subtle communications between them , " @entity98 said			0
he points to the example of how chimps will look to reconcile and embrace one another after a fight or confrontation			2
" they have reassurance and forgiveness of things which go wrong , " he said			0
human threat despite the behavioral and genetic similarities , however , the chimps proximity to rural human settlements can often be problematic and detrimental to their own well - being			2
" in some places that they live , there are lions , leopards , pythons			0
but on the whole , probably their main enemy is something like me , humans , " @entity98 continued			0
" ( some ) people hunt chimps for eating , some places they get bits of chimps for cures , even witchcraft , and for a while there was a trade in baby chimps for their medical research and things like circuses and zoos			2
" in the dense forest and woodlands of @entity6 , chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior			1
but that 's not always the case in other sectors of the @entity7 bush where large swathes of land have been transformed for agricultural purposes			1
this has resulted in a huge number of trees being cut down that would otherwise offer shelter for communities of chimpanzees			2
sadly , the best habitats for chimps are often also the best habitat for the likes of nomadic herders			0
sustainable farming recognizing these problems , the @entity44 is working to teach the local population about sustainable farming so the forest is preserved			0
through the @entity181 , they aim to show villagers that sustainable agricultural techniques can bring both more income and a more vibrant habitat for all species			0
preventing deforestation also has the knock on effect of ensuring sediments from the forest continue to run into @entity11 , maintaining the finely balanced ecosystem beneath the water and the trade of the fisherman in lakeside communities as a result			0
these deep environmental connections are enough to convince some that chimpanzees are key to the future of rural @entity7			1
" in my opinion , chimps are important for the country 's economic growth , " said @entity202 , a @entity181 forest officer			0
" they can be used as a national symbol for tourist attraction into this area of @entity7 , generating income which should later be used for sustainable development of the communities			1
" " they are also important in that their habitat , if well conserved , can act as good vegetation covering for the forest			0
" " but also again , chimps are a global species , so they have to be kept for generations and generation to come			0
" that 's a sentiment that @entity23 herself would be sure to endorse .			1

@entity6 in @entity7 home to a very special group of chimpanzees
chimps here have been under observation for 55 years by primatologist @entity23
