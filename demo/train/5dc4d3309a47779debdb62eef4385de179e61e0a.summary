-- this morning , around 10 a.m. , i was 10 years old again			2
at that hour , the space shuttle @entity2 , mounted atop a @entity4 jetliner , soared over @entity5 and the @entity6 on the way to its permanent home at the @entity10 's @entity9 at @entity11			1
i had walked over from my apartment complex toward @entity14 along the @entity15 to see this double - decker aircraft flying over my head , and stared agog at it like the goofy space - age nerd boy of 50 years ago , face pressed against a black - and - white television screen , listening , back then , to the voice of @entity4 media spokesman @entity22 count backward to zero before a ballistic missile boosted a @entity25 astronaut into low @entity27 orbit			1
read more about the shuttle 's destination back then , it was hard not to imagine that by 2012 we would have a permanent multinational lunar base from which ships with people would be traveling every other month to @entity35 -- and from there , maybe , to one of @entity39 's potentially habitable moons			1
we can see those things better than we once did , thanks to things like the @entity43 , which would n't be working now unless people went up in shuttles for repairs and maintenance			2
but we 're nowhere near being ready or , worse , willing to go there ourselves			0
spot the shuttle , share a photo with @entity50 i have many friends who think that 's just fine			1
they 're a lot like the friends i had back in the ' 60s who believed i was a ninny for gaping at space walks and rendezvousing spaceships , while billions of those dollars were more urgently needed on the ground for such things as education			2
maybe they 're right , i sometimes thought			0
i do n't think that anymore , having read in " @entity64 " ( @entity65 ) , a recently published collection of articles by astrophysicist and @entity70 director @entity69 , that only 4 % of the @entity72 budget during the 1960s went toward meeting president @entity75 's goal of landing men on the moon before 1970			1
he also writes that even with the shuttle program in place , along with all those satellite repair missions , the $ 100 million operating budget for @entity4 represents six years of the agency 's total funding and that said funding amounts to " one half of one percent of [ a @entity72 citizen 's ] tax bill			1
" which still sounds like too much to some			0
but think of what , ultimately , we 're buying with that money			0
i 'm not just talking about all that ancillary technology generated by space travel that eventually improves people 's lives			1
i 'm talking about something more intangible and , yet , more vital to our basic needs			0
i believe it was n't just coincidence that both the space race and the civil rights movement reached their respective apogees at roughly the same time : the late 1950s and early 1960s			1
think about the integration of @entity109 starting barely a month before the @entity111 launch of @entity112 , which galvanized the @entity72 , pushing it toward not just sending its own satellites , but also getting busy with improving and funding math and science education			2
i also think about the morning of may 5 , 1961 , the day that @entity116 was scheduled to become the first @entity72 to fly into space , an act that would help commit his country to a full - fledged moon race			1
that same morning , newspapers all over the country showed a picture of a bus set ablaze by white racists wishing to quell a movement by black and white civil rights activists to ensure racially integrated travel on interstate bus lines in the @entity130			1
at the time , the tendency was to think of such events as being at best mutually exclusive			0
i think they are now both logical and synchronous outgrowths of the human impulse to break down barriers and move ahead			0
the less afraid we are to think outside the box scientifically , the less afraid we are of other barriers , other things that constrict our natures			0
this week , @entity141 celebrated the 65th anniversary of @entity143 breaking the color barrier on april 15 , 1947			0
seven months later , almost to the day , @entity145 poked a hole in the sky with a rocket plane and broke the sound barrier			0
i do not say one event led directly to the other ( not necessarily , anyway )			0
but i do think both were driven by the same insistent energy to fly higher , push harder , maybe even make ourselves better people in the very long run			0
i will try very hard not to consider @entity2 's last touchdown as the end of something , though i still fear it may signify @entity160 -- not just of a dream , but of our very capacity to dream			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			2

@entity165 : he *'ll* watch as space shuttle is flown above @entity6
he says as a boy he was entranced with promise of space travel
he says @entity72 early space progress *tracked* with civil rights movement
@entity176 : @entity2 's exit may signal end of @entity72 's capacity to dream
