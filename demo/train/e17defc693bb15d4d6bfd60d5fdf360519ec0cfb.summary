the @entity0 recently approved the budget designed by rep. @entity2 , a leading contender for the @entity4 presidential nomination in 2016			1
@entity2 claimed that his budget is balanced and " harnesses the power of economic freedom and respects the dignity of every person			2
" but the problem is that it fails on basic math and will likely put @entity12 back in the budget wars			1
moreover , it signals that @entity2 has big ambitions , including running for president			2
will @entity2 's budget plan help him succeed ? it 's hard to say			1
@entity19 want members of @entity21 to work together			0
in a @entity26 poll after @entity22 's @entity24 address , 67 % said they want " bipartisan compromise with @entity21 on major issues			0
" @entity2 's budget rejects compromise in favor of appealing to hard core @entity4 values			1
the @entity0 's passage of @entity2 's budget indicates that we are being dragged back into ideological battles that most @entity19 reject			1
this budget wo n't go anywhere in the @entity37 , as it breaks last year 's fragile compromises that avoided a government shutdown and threatened a dangerous default of @entity19 's debt			0
passing this budget also means @entity21 will pass very few or no appropriations bills , with lawmakers posturing and casting symbolic votes as the 2014 midterm elections approach			0
unlike the current budget deal that was reached last fall , which cuts defense and domestic spending equally , @entity2 would increase military spending and provide large tax cuts for millionaires , with deep cuts in non-defense spending footing the bill			2
but the @entity0 can not cut enough discretionary spending to fund @entity2 's budget			1
so it attacks @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , with a plan to increase the @entity61 eligibility age and turn it into a voucher program			0
breaking @entity19 's health and income security programs is the long - term political game for @entity4			2
the smarter ones know they can not achieve budget balance and more tax cuts for the wealthy by cutting only domestic discretionary spending , which is just under 17 % of the total federal budget			0
how can @entity2 claim that his budget is balanced ? by invoking what used to be called " voodoo economics " -- assuming budget cuts and unfair tax cuts will unleash economic growth and generate adequate tax revenue			0
former reagan administration economist @entity84 has criticized this approach as " just another way for @entity4 to enact tax cuts and block tax increases			0
it is not about honest revenue - estimating ; it 's about using smoke and mirrors to institutionalize @entity4 ideology into the budget process			1
" of course , @entity2 is n't stupid , so why the phony budget math and the return of voodoo economics ? because it serves his presidential ambitions			1
@entity2 's budget satisfies two wings of @entity4 true believers -- budget balancers , and anti-tax zealots who want not only no new taxes , but further tax cuts for the wealthy			1
these groups used to fight with each other about deficits , but modern @entity4 politics have united the two positions			0
since @entity2 's budget will not likely pass the @entity37 , it is really an attempt to strengthen him in the 2016 @entity4 primaries , where candidates will ignore basic math and pretend they can balance the budget solely through spending cuts and still have money left over for regressive tax cuts			1
this is a key @entity4 battle , and the shocking response is that other @entity4 conservatives say @entity2 did n't go far enough			2
@entity124 called @entity2 's plan a " joke , " because it does not deal adequately with " wasteful government overspending			1
" when it comes to basic math , the @entity4 budget debate reminds one of the movie , " @entity133 , " or " phony and @entity134			1
" and compared to @entity124 , @entity2 might in fact look like a reasonable budget analyst			0
but his ideas are deeply dangerous			0
even if you think balancing the budget is the most important economic challenge we face ( it is n't ) the numbers simply do n't add up			0
true budget balancers and fiscal conservatives , who would be looking for both spending cuts and increased revenue , have virtually been driven out of today 's @entity4			2
this happened in @entity149 where moderate @entity4 worried that deep tax cuts would harm the state 's finances and gut basic services like education			2
but they were defeated in primary elections by more strident @entity156 , backed by the deep pockets of the @entity159 brothers and other big money interests			0
so @entity2 's budget is best viewed as his opening shot in the 2016 presidential contest			1
to win the nomination , he must appeal to the most uncompromising elements in his party			0
@entity167 once again is playing second fiddle to intra-party @entity4 battles , and those battles could drag all of us back into the divisive and unproductive budget wars of the past several years .			1

the @entity0 recently approved the budget designed by rep. @entity2
@entity176 : @entity2 's *proposal* fails on basic math and will restart budget wars
he says @entity2 is signaling his presidential ambitions by appealing to @entity4 radicals
@entity176 : @entity4 intra-party battles *continue* while moderates lose out
