-- the first weekend in december is a notoriously weak one at the box office , and , true to form , most movies faced harsh declines this weekend after the record - breaking @entity5 frame			1
but @entity13 's animated musical " @entity11 " managed to score a not - so - severe 53 percent fall to $ 31.6 million this weekend , which sent it past " @entity10 " and straight into the no. 1 spot on the chart			1
" @entity11 " has earned $ 134.3 million after 12 days in wide release , 39 percent more than 2010 ′ s " tangled , " which had earned $ 96.6 million at the same point in its run			1
the film will match its $ 150 million budget by this time next week , and if it maintains its current pace ( which seems likely given its " @entity22 " @entity23 ) , " @entity11 " could be headed for a finish of about $ 280 million			1
movie review : ' @entity11 ' the film 's box office success is sending its soundtrack into the upper echelons of the music charts			1

in second place , " @entity35 : catching fire " fell 64 percent to $ 27 million , giving the blockbuster a $ 336.7 million domestic total after just 17 days			1
" @entity10 " is still playing about $ 34 million ahead of " @entity35 " at the equivalent point in its run , but as evidenced by this weekend 's drop , it 's falling faster than that film , too			1
" @entity10 " appears likely to finish with just about $ 400 - 410 million , matching " @entity35 ' " $ 408 million total			1
worldwide , though , " @entity10 " will be much , much bigger			0
it 's already earned $ 673 million , and it will take just a few days for the film to blitz past " @entity35 ' " $ 691 million global haul			1
