it was a very telling mini-scandal , the faux - fury over @entity4 's short visit to @entity5			1
first there was the phony claim that @entity5 television had blurred the first lady 's image in its transmission of the @entity13 ' condolence call on the kingdom			1
then came the kerfuffle over her outfit			2
was she insensitive in not wearing a headscarf ? should she had worn black ? then , finally , we heard the questions about whether she committed an etiquette no - no when she shook hands with the new @entity5 monarch , @entity26			1
none of these accusations and claims amount to much on their own			2
but there is a reason , a very good reason , why social media turned its attention sharply toward @entity4 in @entity5			1
the presence of an @entity37 first lady on @entity5 territory embodies the intense unease that surrounds @entity37 and @entity41 relations with the @entity5 kingdom			1
@entity5 can be the most hospitable people in the world , and they are friends of the @entity37			1
but all is not well with the relationship			0
the spectacle of @entity37 and @entity49 leaders lavishly praising and courting the @entity5 royals is a most unsettling one			1
@entity37 - @entity5 relations present a profound moral dilemma for @entity37			1
they constitute a classic example of the tough choices a nation faces when its ideals clash with its interests			0
the @entity37 wants to have good relations with @entity5 , not only because it has a lot of oil , but because it is one of the most powerful countries in the @entity65 and the two countries share many strategic goals			1
the @entity37 needs @entity5 -- and @entity5 needs the @entity37 at the same time , many of @entity5 's practices stand in direct violation of @entity37 's -- and the world 's -- most cherished values			1
values or interests : that is the question			0
let 's now put an end to the discussion about @entity4			1
she did absolutely nothing wrong			0
in fact , the claim that her attire and performance created a firestorm in @entity5 is plainly false			1
by some counts , there were some 1,500 tweets with the @entity90 hashtag # ميشيل_أوباما_سفور , which means roughly # michelle_obama_unveiled			0
that is hardly a @entity92 , considering that @entity5 has more than 5 million @entity94 users			1
second , the first lady followed protocol			0
@entity5 law does not require foreign visitors to wear a hijab , the @entity101 headscarf			1
this was no protocol breach , and it was also not an unusually courageous move on her part			0
countless prominent women have appeared in public meeting @entity5 royals without wearing headscarves			1
we 've seen @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , among others , visit the kingdom in @entity41 attire			0
finally , that handshake : the @entity26 would not have shaken hands with @entity4 if he had not wanted to do so			2
in fact , we saw an endless parade of dignitaries shake the president 's hand and walk right past the first lady , bluntly , rudely , ignoring her			2
that is a breach of etiquette			0
but it was not committed by the first lady or by @entity26			0
so it looks like this is the scandal that was n't			2
a non-tempest , if you will			0
but there was a teapot			0
the story made headlines because people in the @entity37 and in the @entity141 feel a scandal in the relationship , because much of what goes on in @entity5 is an affront not just to @entity41 principles but to human rights conventions endorsed by most of the world			1
and some of the most egregious violations of those values are perpetrated against @entity5 women			2
for decades @entity5 women have protested the indefensible rule that bans them from driving , making @entity5 the only country in the world with such a ban			2
a @entity5 woman is required to have a male relative as a " guardian " who must approve her travel and other key decisions in her life			2
@entity5 women are required to wear the abaya , a head - to - toe cover , and many wear a niqab , which covers the face			1
the fact that they dress differently is not in itself a rights violation , but the fact that they have no choice in the matter is			0
@entity5 women , who are intelligent , strong , competent , mature , capable of making decision for themselves as well as any @entity5 man , are treated in many cases as if they were children			2
but it 's not just women whose rights , as defined by international standards , are violated			2
there is no freedom of religion in the kingdom , where everyone by law must be a muslim and the public practice of other religions is forbidden			0
and freedom of expression is severely restricted			0
@entity194 , who sought to promote a discussion about social and religious issues on his website , was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for " insulting @entity101 , " and showing disobedience			0
he suffered the first 50 lashes a few weeks ago , and the international outcry , combined with the toll it took on his health , led the government to put the rest of the sentence on hold			0
then there are the public beheadings after questionable legal proceedings			0
already 16 people have been beheaded this year			0
there were 87 such punishments last year			0
so what is the @entity37 to do ? cooperation with @entity5 is crucial in restoring stability to the @entity65 , in fighting @entity218 and other terrorist groups , in keeping oil prices low to pressure @entity221 and @entity222 , and in a number of other high - priority items on the world 's agenda			1
the answer is a frustrating balance of realism and idealism			0
the answer requires acknowledging -- in private and in public , as @entity113 has done -- that we find some of their practices unacceptable , along with an open and unapologetic defense of the principles of equality and basic freedoms			0
the @entity37 can not sever relations with @entity241 , and the truth is that it can not force the @entity5 to change , but keeping quiet on the matter is an unseemly capitulation			1
a condolence call was not the time for public criticism , and @entity4 's presence in @entity241 was a meaningful sign that the @entity37 believes women belong in the public sphere			1
the scandal was a sign of the frustration people feel with this ethical dilemma .			1

@entity258 : @entity4 's not wearing headscarf in @entity5 is a faux - scandal
kerfuffle really shows @entity37 ethical dilemma in dealing with a *repressive* regime , she says
