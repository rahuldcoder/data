-- @entity1 versus @entity2 , capitalism versus communism : the @entity5 lasted from the end of @entity7 until the fall of the @entity9 in 1991			1
yet this war was at its height in the 1960s			2
that 's the decade the @entity15 played out , the @entity13 entered the @entity16 to fight communist forces there , and president @entity18 sent a team of @entity21 exiles into @entity21 's @entity22 to try to overthrow leader @entity23			1
here are five other momentous events of the 1960s @entity5 that you might not know : 1			1
the @entity9 shot down an @entity13 plane and captured the pilot the @entity13 had been flying @entity30 spy planes over the @entity9 for some time to see if the @entity9 were aiming missiles at @entity13 and to snap photos of local newspaper headlines			1
the @entity34 told president @entity35 that its sophisticated aircraft , which reached altitudes of up to 70,000 feet , could not be shot down			0
but on may 1 , 1960 , @entity30 pilot @entity38 disappeared on a flight over @entity40			0
@entity38 had been shot down and captured , and @entity9 leader @entity41 made the wreckage a public exhibition			1
a humiliated @entity35 was forced to admit the @entity13 had , in fact , committed espionage			1
@entity41 threatened to " bury " @entity13 three days after meeting @entity23 for the first time , @entity41 visited the @entity47 on september 23 , 1960			1
the @entity9 leader believed communism was the future and that @entity13 needed to be contained			1
in his address to the @entity52 , the @entity9 leader threatened to " bury " @entity13			1
@entity18 did n't mention a single domestic issue in his inaugural speech newly elected @entity18 felt his job was to run the @entity5 and defeat the @entity40 , which he made clear in his january 20 , 1961 , inaugural speech , stating : " let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , uphold any foe , to assure the survival and the success of liberty			1
the space race made @entity13 fear for their lives when @entity9 pilot @entity70 became the first person to enter outer space on april 12 , 1961 , orbiting the @entity73 in one hour and 48 minutes , @entity13 worried the @entity13 could no longer protect its people			1
some thought if you could put a man into space , you could put a nuclear warhead into space			2
@entity41 reacted by saying , " now let the capitalist countries try to catch up			0
" opinion : @entity84 's empire building is not a new @entity5 5			2
panic over a soccer field led to the @entity15 when a @entity34 consultant spotted soccer fields along the coast in @entity21 in september 1962 , he became concerned because , as he put it , " @entity21 play baseball , @entity40 play soccer			0
" the @entity34 analyst had deduced that the field indicated the presence of a @entity9 military camp nearby			2
@entity18 approved @entity30 flights over @entity21 but did n't want to get sucked into another @entity22 , the failed invasion to overthrow @entity23 in april 1961			0
photographs convinced @entity18 that the @entity40 were putting missiles in @entity21			0
after @entity13 intelligence indicated which @entity13 regions were vulnerable to a possible nuclear attack from @entity21 soil , @entity18 feared that 30 million @entity13 lives were in danger			1
was it really a simpler time ? your ' 60s family photos , revealed @entity18 did not want to attack @entity21 , but he was worried about the survival of the human race			2
he imposed a blockade , and on october 22 , 1962 , he announced to the world that large , long - range weapons of sudden destruction posed a threat to @entity13			2
when @entity40 sent 25 ships toward @entity21 , the @entity118 thought it was the early stages of @entity121 at the last minute @entity9 ships turned around			1
for the first time , @entity41 acknowledged the presence of @entity9 missiles in @entity21 , but argued they were merely defensive , and promised to remove them if @entity18 promised not to invade @entity21			2
@entity128 : @entity18 planned to get out of @entity129 it 's impossible to know where we 'd be today had @entity18 not gone to @entity133 in 1963			0
until that year , the president had treated @entity129 as a second - tier issue			0
he was dealing with @entity21 , @entity136 and domestic matters			0
he also felt the people of @entity129 ought to defeat the communists themselves			0
while the @entity9 supported @entity129 , the @entity13 supported the @entity140			1
and fears cropped up that if @entity144 fell , the rest of @entity143 was vulnerable , as well as @entity145 and @entity146			0
when the @entity144 government was overthrown just weeks before @entity18 's fateful trip to @entity133 , he told an aide he would begin to discuss getting out of @entity129 in 1964 , after his re-election			0
most historians agree that @entity18 would never have done what @entity153 did , which was trust the military implicitly			0
@entity18 was skeptical of military advice			0
in his december 17 , 1963 , address to the @entity52 , president @entity153 told a nation in mourning : " @entity13 wants to see the @entity5 end			1
we want sanity and security and peace for all			0
and above all president @entity18 i am sure would regard as his best memorial the fact that in his three years as president the world became a little safer , and the way ahead became a little brighter			0

the early 1960s were the most intense years of the @entity5
