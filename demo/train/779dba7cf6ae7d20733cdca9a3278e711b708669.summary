@entity0 -- four of the 10 @entity3 rescue teams mobilized in the hours following the earthquake in @entity5 are returning home tuesday -- having never traveled farther than their local airports			1
federal government officials said the four -- including teams in @entity12 , @entity13 and two in @entity15 -- were not flown there because @entity5 could not " absorb " them and because they were being held as relief for crews that made it into the country			1
disaster experts said a bottleneck at the main airport in @entity24 could have prevented the crews from entering @entity5 quickly , but they scoffed at the suggestion that the teams , skilled in locating and freeing people entombed in collapsed buildings , should be held in reserve			2
" that 72 - hour window [ in which most rescues are attempted ] is not some casual number , " said @entity31 , director of the @entity32 at @entity33			2
" it 's actually a very serious [ calculation of when most lives can be saved ]			0
" @entity40 : search the list of the missing and found @entity31 said it made no sense to withhold @entity46 team resources until the latter days of a disaster			0
a second expert said the @entity3 has an additional 18 @entity50 teams it could have drawn upon if reserves were needed			1
in the event of earthquakes , moving @entity50 teams should be the " highest possible priority , " and the only limitation should be insurmountable logistical ones , @entity31 said			0
the @entity59 trains and funds the nation 's 28 @entity50 teams , but in @entity5 they have been working under contract with the @entity64 , the @entity65 organization heading the relief effort			1
see how rescuers race against time @entity64 spokesman @entity69 said the agency made the decision to withhold the four @entity3 teams " in consultation with the @entity5 government			1
" the relief effort is at this point " prioritizing the shipments of life - sustaining commodities , including food , water and medicine			0
" the @entity50 teams specialize in rescuing people in collapsed structures			0
the teams typically have about 80 members and travel with food , bedding and generators so they will be self - sustaining and will not be a drain on the communities they are trying to help			0
full coverage @entity96 updates asked monday on @entity97 " why the four @entity3 teams and some teams in @entity100 had not been brought to @entity5 , @entity101 , the @entity3 ambassador to the country , said , " i 'll be honest with you			1
i have n't heard those stories about the search - and - rescue teams not being mobilized down here			2
" @entity101 said he would look into the issue , adding the teams may have been held back because of capacity issues			0
he also said there are " limitations on where these people can go , where they can set up , where they can bed down			0
" a @entity64 spokesman suggested monday that the 43 teams that traveled from around the world to help @entity5 were sufficient			1
they include 1,739 first responders and 161 canines			2
@entity69 said @entity64 directed @entity59 to prepare four more teams for possible deployment to " ensure that any additional search - and - rescue needs could be met immediately upon request			1
" based on postings on their web sites , the teams thought they were going to @entity5 , until being told to stand down monday .			0

officials say @entity5 could not " absorb " the additional four @entity3 teams mobilized to help @entity5
@entity33 expert says teams should have been sent within first 72 hours
@entity3 ambassador to @entity5 says he 's *unaware* that search teams mobilized but stayed in the @entity3
there are more than 1,700 rescuers , 161 canines already in @entity5 , @entity64 official says
