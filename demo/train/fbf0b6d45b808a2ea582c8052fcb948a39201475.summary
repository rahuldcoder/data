-- @entity1 called his poem " stupid			1
" officials at his @entity5 high school called it hazing and harassment			1
the 16 - year - old lineman was kicked off the @entity11 football team earlier this week after he read a lament about his squad 's 1 - 7 season for an @entity16 composition class			1
the kicker : he was suspended from school for four days			2
@entity1 said he was n't hazing or harassing anyone , and he did n't mention any names in his poem			1
here 's the text of " stupid : " losing season , favoritism , @entity26 passes from best friend to best friend			2
continuously doing what does n't work , the inability to separate being a father and a coach			0
dropped passes , but yet still the " superstar , " yeah , right			0
where 's my scholarship ? i can drop passes , run backwards , @entity39 tackles , and be afraid to take a hit			0
that 's top of the line @entity45 1 material right there			2
if that 's what they wanted , they definitely got it			0
this whole town will be glad when he is gone			0
for anyone who does n't understand what i am saying ? @entity57 's screwed ! according to @entity0 affiliate @entity59 , principal @entity58 said @entity1 was suspended because he " wrote a mean and disrespectful poem about another student and our athletic director / head coach			1
" @entity65 , @entity1 's mother , told @entity59 she met with @entity58 on monday and was told the poem was bullying			1
but on thursday , @entity1 was told he was back on the team in time for the last two games of the season and could come back to school			1
@entity71 , superintendent for @entity72 , said after reconsideration , @entity1 's punishment had been reversed			1
@entity1 , a junior , had already served two days of detention , but they will be expunged from his record			2
he seemed a little unsure as to what type of reception he would get from his teammates when he returned to the locker room , but hoped for the best			0
" i have n't really gotten to talk to any of them yet about what they feel			0
if -- i mean , i 'm sure they 'll all be happy i 'm able to come back and everything , but i have n't heard anything , " he told @entity0 .			0
