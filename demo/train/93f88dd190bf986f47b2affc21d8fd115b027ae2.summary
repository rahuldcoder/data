@entity0 -- military hardware that can be used in nuclear devices and ground fighting can be easily purchased in the @entity7 and shipped overseas , a government investigation revealed thursday			1
this inclinometer , which can be used in homemade bombs , was easily bought and shipped overseas			2
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) watchdog agency set up fake companies to obtain military and dual use items -- which have both military and commercial use -- in the @entity7 and ship them overseas , according to a report made public at a @entity18 subcommittee hearing			1
the domestic purchases allow buyers to avoid @entity7 restrictions on sales to foreign entities , it noted			1
items purchased in the bogus transactions included parts for making nuclear devices and guiding missiles that could carry nuclear warheads , as well as night - vision devices , body armor and other hardware for ground combat , said the report provided to the @entity36 subcommittee			1
" there appears to be a gigantic loophole within our laws that makes it easy for our enemies to get hold of our superior military technology and use it against us , " said rep. @entity37 , @entity38			1
@entity47 , a @entity10 managing director who led the 13 - month investigation , said it found " sensitive dual - use and military technology can be easily and legally purchased from manufacturers and distributors within the @entity7 and illegally exported without detection			1
" he stressed that no laws were broken by any of the companies that sold items to the undercover @entity10 operation , and that the magnitude of trying to check all overseas travelers and shipments made it impossible to halt illegal export of the items under current law			1
committee members said the lack of regulation or export controls made the situation particularly troubling			0
" the scandal here may be what is legal , not what is illegal , " said rep. @entity71 , @entity72			1
however , he warned against excessive regulations that could stifle necessary commerce in items used by law enforcement , medical and other industries			0
@entity47 held up some of the items purchased by undercover investigators , including a small device that looked like a spark plug called a triggered spark gap			2
the item has medical applications and can also be used to detonate a nuclear weapon , he said			2
@entity47 also displayed a small device called a gyro chip that can be used to steer guided missiles			0
other items on display in the committee room included some used in improvised explosive devices ( @entity98 ) that target @entity7 soldiers in @entity100 , as well as sophisticated body armor and night - vision devices			1
undercover investigators complied with all required checks in purchasing the equipment , @entity47 said , including the submission of end - user agreements that forbid exporting the equipment or using it in any nuclear , biological and missile weapons			2
such documents amount to an " honor system " pledge , rather than any enforcement mechanism , he said			0
the only further checks involved are confirming the validity of credit cards and the existence of web sites , @entity47 said			0
most of the transactions took place by e-mail and telephone calls			0
" the kind of front company we used and the kind of scheme we used is the kind being used by terrorist organizations today , " @entity47 said			0
" this was not a hypothetical situation ; this is being done			0
" the investigation shipped some of the dual - use items to " a country that is a known trans - shipment point for terrorist governments and foreign governments attempting to acquire sensitive technology , " @entity47 said			2
he declined to name the country , but said it was in southeast @entity143 and that the shipments were simple packages labeled documents and sent by regular mail			0
" as @entity10 proves , a cardboard box and the @entity151 is all it takes to move dual - use items out of the country , " said rep. @entity148 , @entity149			1
one of those duped by the investigation -- @entity157 , a technology dealer in @entity159 -- told the committee he complied with all required checks in selling an f - 16 engine computer to what he thought was a legitimate @entity7 buyer			1
asked by @entity37 why anyone other than the military would need such a device , @entity157 said his customers often are museums , collectors and film companies seeking authentic items			0
@entity157 said existing regulations were counter-productive , with seemingly harmless items associated with military gear more tightly controlled than the dual - use items of the investigation			0
at the same time , he said , making the system too restrictive would harm the competitive ability of @entity7 manufacturers			2
export laws in the @entity7 have remained virtually unchanged since the sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , @entity183 - @entity182 of the @entity10 told the committee			1
she called for a " holistic " approach involving all agencies charged with security and commerce for an issue involving billions of dollars in exports .			0
