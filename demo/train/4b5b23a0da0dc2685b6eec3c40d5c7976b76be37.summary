-- @entity1 is in a state of political turmoil sparked by prime minister @entity5 's call earlier this week for a referendum on the latest bailout package from @entity8			1
a confidence vote in his government is scheduled for friday night -- in the meantime , uncertainty rules			1
the crisis is unfolding as leaders of the @entity17 group of nations meet in @entity19 , @entity20 , for economic talks , amid fears that a debt default in @entity1 could send shock waves through the global economy			2
so what could come next for @entity1 ? analysts see several potential scenarios			2
the vote of confidence in @entity5 's government is expected to go ahead as planned , despite discussions thursday on the formation of an interim coalition or national unity government			1
if he wins the confidence vote , he could claim a fresh mandate for his ruling @entity40 party -- although even some within his party think its days in charge are numbered			1
@entity46 lawmaker @entity45 told @entity1 state tv channel @entity47 that ideally @entity5 would win the vote , but a national unity government would then be formed			1
if he loses the vote , the government would go into caretaker status until early elections can be held , said @entity53 , senior fellow and director of the @entity55 at the @entity56 and a former @entity58 deputy assistant secretary of state			1
" what 's a foregone conclusion is that @entity5 would have to step down and allow a technocratic government that would receive the full support of parliament to be that caretaker , " she said			1
in another scenario , the leader of the main opposition @entity66 said thursday that his party could enter a coalition government with the @entity40 party , as an interim stage leading to new elections			1
@entity5 's office said he is prepared to enter a national unity government with the opposition , but rejected the condition that early elections be held			1
opposition leader @entity76 later thursday said @entity5 should step down and called for snap elections within six weeks			1
under @entity1 law , a vote can not be held until at least 30 days after elections are called , meaning that the @entity1 people would go to the polls in early december at the soonest			1
in that case , it would be likely that the conservatives would win the most votes but would not have a parliamentary majority , forcing them to form a coalition government , said @entity90 , an assistant professor of politics at the @entity92 in the @entity93			0
that coalition could include far - right parties or @entity40 , but with the @entity66 lawmakers in the driver 's seat			0
the conservatives have said @entity1 needs to bargain harder with @entity8 on any deal			2
another scenario is that @entity40 and the conservatives join in a longer - term grand coalition , or unity , government			2
that option would give greater stability , as it would avoid elections , and could ensure that @entity1 stayed in the euro and the @entity109 , said @entity90			1
as for the planned referendum , the likelihood of it taking place appears to be diminishing			0
@entity5 told his cabinet thursday he was backing off from a referendum vote because the opposition @entity66 had agreed to the need to pass austerity measures required by the bailout			1
and the office of finance minister @entity120 said friday he had confirmed to the @entity121 that the referendum had been scrapped			0
that news would certainly come as a relief to @entity8 's leaders			0
@entity127 chancellor @entity126 and @entity20 president @entity128 warned @entity5 in @entity19 wednesday that @entity1 would have to leave the euro zone if voters rejected the bailout plan			1
but @entity1 could find it hard to put the cat back in the bag now it 's been allowed out , @entity132 said			1
although some observers say the referendum will not survive if @entity5 does not , she foresees a scenario where the @entity1 people demand a say in decisions that will affect them , and their country , for decades			1
she warns it could also lead to the governments of other countries , such as the @entity147 and @entity148 , facing calls for difficult decisions to be put them to a referendum			0
the recent crisis has prompted talk of a " democracy deficit , " she said , as people in the different countries within the @entity109 complain that they have no say in important issues			0
@entity159 of @entity8 's wishes would come at a substantial cost for @entity1			2
at stake is a deal that would wipe out 100 billion euros in @entity1 debt , half of what it owes to private creditors , and a promise of 30 billion euros from the public sector to help pay off some of the remaining debts			2
that makes the whole deal worth 130 billion euros ( $ 178 billion )			0
if its people vote " no " to the bailout plan , @entity8 leaders have made clear they will not hand over a sixth tranche of @entity8 funds from a previously agreed bailout			2
the @entity1 government is expected to run out of money in mid-november , and that 8 billion euro ( about $ 10.9 billion ) tranche is needed to keep it afloat			1
there are already signs that @entity1 's domestic banking system is starting to seize up amid the doubts over future @entity8 funding , @entity132 said			2
as for the euro zone -- the group of 17 @entity8 nations that use the euro as currency -- the top priority will be to stop the turmoil in @entity1 spreading beyond its borders			2
ahead of the @entity17 , @entity58 president @entity196 made clear that the stakes were high for everyone and that " contagion " must be prevented			0
" the most important task for us is to resolve the financial crisis here in @entity8 , " he said , adding that the @entity58 will " continue to be a partner with @entity8 to resolve these issues			0
" @entity207 , research director in international economics at the @entity210 - based @entity209 think tank , said it was imperative that a robust firewall be put in place around @entity1 to stop other countries being dragged down			0
such a firewall would include a better - funded @entity8 bailout find and flexible credit for countries caught up on the margins of the crisis , she said			0
she predicts that whatever the fate of @entity5 's government , @entity1 is likely to be in a state of political paralysis for some time			1
@entity8 must put provisions in place to allow @entity1 to leave the euro , if that becomes necessary , with minimum damage , she said			0
" the priority now is to focus not on @entity1 but on the rest of @entity8 , in particular @entity148 , which is the country most likely to be affected , " she said			0
a joint statement from @entity234 president @entity233 and @entity121 president @entity235 at the @entity17 reiterated @entity8 's commitment to keeping the euro zone above water			0
" @entity8 is fully aware of its responsibility in these difficult times			0
we , as the world 's largest market , have to play a major role in the global recovery , " they said			0
@entity0 's @entity246 contributed to this report .			0
