a lab mix - up involving a deadly flu virus strain added to the @entity3 's public relations nightmare this summer			1
on friday , the public health agency released the results of its internal investigation into the incident , along with a series of reports on actions being taken to ensure lab safety protocols are being properly followed			2
in may , @entity3 lab workers unintentionally mixed a low pathogenic , or non-dangerous , avian influenza virus sample with a potentially deadly virus called @entity16 , then shipped the sample to an external lab run by the @entity20 @entity19			1
the @entity16 strain has killed millions of birds and infected more than 600 people over the last decade			2
but no one appears to have been at - risk of being infected during the incident since the sample was stored and shipped properly , according to the @entity3 reports			2
" the contamination most likely happened due to the failure of a laboratory scientist to adhere to established best practices and the absence of an approved laboratory team - specific protocol for the work being done , " the reports concluded			1
dr. @entity38 , the @entity3 's director , found out about the @entity16 incident nearly six weeks after it happened , something he called at the time " most distressing			1
" this delay in reporting the cross-contamination was due to " a lack of awareness and understanding about reporting requirements for @entity47 , " according to the reports			0
around the same time he heard about the flu incident , @entity38 was dealing with the possible exposure of up to 86 of his workers to anthrax			0
anthrax investigation turns up ' distressing ' issues at @entity3 @entity55 , who headed the @entity56 and @entity57 involved , submitted his resignation in july			0
he had been reassigned from his post in june after the anthrax incident was made public			0
@entity3 lab director resigns after anthrax incident the @entity3 says the potential anthrax exposure happened between june 6 and 13			1
the bioterrorism lab had been preparing anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the @entity3 's @entity69 campus and failed to deactivate the samples adequately			1
according to another @entity3 investigation report , the exposure happened because the lab did n't use an approved sterilization technique			1
it did n't have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed , and there was a limited knowledge of peer - reviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous			0
the lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe			0
bottom line : " the scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated , " @entity38 said last month			1
it " should have happened , and it did n't			0
" as a result of these problems , the @entity3 has stopped transferring materials in and out of its highest - level labs			0
" the moratorium will remain in place pending lab - by - lab review of policies and procedures for laboratory safety and security , " the @entity3 says			2
@entity3 's lab problems have ripple effect on other outbreaks @entity38 plans to appoint a @entity3 director of laboratory safety , and establish a working group to review safety protocols			1
" the work of safety is never complete , " dr. @entity109 , interim director of laboratory safety , said in a statement			0
" we will continue to take all necessary steps to maintain safety and advance @entity3 's critical laboratory science work , so that @entity3 labs are the most scientifically rigorous and the safest in the world			0
