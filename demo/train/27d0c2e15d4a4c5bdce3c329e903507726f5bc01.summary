-- @entity1 is fast becoming the @entity2 of ivory			1
as one of the chief gateways to mainland @entity6 -- the world 's largest market for ivory , according to animal welfare groups -- @entity1 has seized tons of what @entity6 collectors call " white gold			1
" in the last six months alone , more than six tons of elephant ivory worth close to $ hk50 million ( $ us6.5 million ) was confiscated in @entity1			1
in one shipment alone , @entity1 authorities seized 3.8 tons of tusks , equivalent to one - sixth of the total illegal ivory confiscated worldwide last year			1
where this ivory is stored in @entity1 is a closely guarded secret			1
" for security reasons , we are not in a position to disclose further details of the keeping premises and the seized items , " a spokesman for @entity1 's @entity24 told @entity0			1
with a black market price of almost $ 3,000 a kilogram , @entity1 's authorities are taking no chances			1
" the keeping premises are equipped with adequate security measures such as security guards and cctv surveillance , " he said			0
but high - profile thefts in @entity41 and @entity42 have highlighted the security headache and the drain on resources that ivory stockpiles pose for countries			0
" for many countries where ivory is detected entering the country illegally and seizures take place , especially involving large amounts of ivory , there is the very real possibility , given its current high value and the expense involved with maintaining security , of it finding its way onto the market , " said dr @entity48 , the @entity49 for the wildlife trade monitoring network traffic			2
" a number of countries have come out and acknowledged that they have lost ivory from stockpiles , " she added			0
part of the problem , she said , was that countries are only required by international agreements on animal trade to report the weight rather than the number of tusks confiscated			2
" if ( countries ) have to provide detailed records including the number of pieces as well as the weight of individual items , it makes it easier to verify and also allows more information to be used in analysis such as transportation trends , " she said			0
scientists have begun a program of mapping poaching hotspots by analyzing dna from seized tusks			0
for @entity96 , regional director for the @entity97 , stockpiles are an invaluable resource in creating a crime database			0
" there is a lab that has been set up in the @entity102 in the @entity103 where they have already constructed a map of @entity93 which will help them pinpoint which country the ivory came from and where the poaching hotspots are , " she told @entity0			0
@entity110 said that more often than not , poaching is repeated in the same areas			0
information of this type helps law enforcers to choke off the trade at source			0
while the @entity1 stockpile is among the best protected in the region , and authorities have been quick to cooperate with the dna database program , @entity110 said stockpiles in general present a risk			1
" we feel that confiscated ivory requires a lot of capacity to keep it in a secure location and leaving it in these places will always tempt people to get their hands on it			0
" according to the @entity134 on @entity135 ( @entity136 ) which wrapped up in @entity137 this week , a large amount of confiscated @entity140 ivory goes missing every year			2
" the size of ivory stockpiles in many countries in and outside @entity140 , and their possible contribution to the illegal ivory supply chain , remains another important gap in the current understanding of the dynamics of the illegal ivory trade , " a report unveiled at @entity136 -- entitled " @entity142 , @entity143 " -- stated			1
" this gap could be substantially narrowed through mandatory , regular inventorying , " it said			0
" forensic techniques may help to establish the extent to which ivory in illegal trade is derived from poaching or was leaked from official stockpiles			1
" the report said the number of large - scale seizures of ivory ( more than 800kgs ) destined for @entity166 had more than doubled since 2009 , reaching an all - time high in 2011			1
illegal ivory trade activity has more than doubled since 2007 and is now over three times larger than it was in 1998 , the report said			1
the report also said that highly - organized criminal networks operate with relative impunity to move large shipments of ivory to markets in @entity166 as a result of weak governance and collusive corruption at all levels			2
while ivory has since 1989 been on @entity180 of @entity136 -- which outlaws its international trade -- critics blame a one - off sale of ivory stockpiled in @entity140 to @entity6 and @entity185 in 2008 for the latest spike in illegal ivory trading			1
as elephant numbers increased following the ban , @entity136 officials agreed to the sale of 68 tons of ivory from stockpiles in the hope that regulated ivory would flood the market , putting further pressure on poached ivory			2
the paper trail set up by the @entity6 government to cover the newly regulated ivory products became the perfect cover for illegal traders			1
a flurry of false documentation branded poached ivory legal for trade and elephants have been slaughtered in greater numbers than ever			2
in one case reported by the @entity213 , the employees of a major @entity6 ivory distributor were able to register and legalize ' new ' , or illegal ivory , simply by declaring to provincial customs authorities that they had forgotten to register ivory before the ban , but wanted to " register it now			1
" according to @entity136 figures , the number of slain elephants in @entity140 was estimated at 17,000 in 2011 , 7.5 % of the continent 's elephant population			0
conservation groups say nothing short of a complete ban will halt poaching			1
meanwhile , alternatives such as mammoth ivory -- legal because the mammoth has been extinct for more then 4,500 years -- has done little to stem the poaching , claim experts , instead fueling demand for ivory products			2
a report on the mammoth ivory trade commissioned by @entity236 in 2010 found that buyers of mammoth ivory were sometimes undiscriminating about the provenance of the piece			2
" some buyers of mammoth ivory items may notice that the quality of elephant ivory is usually superior for larger pieces and may switch to elephant ivory objects , which might encourage more elephant poaching , " the report said			0
" if mammoth ivory objects were to be introduced into @entity140 , businessmen might try to use them as a cover for their illegal elephant ivory objects ; small items can be difficult to distinguish			0
" in @entity1 , one of the main hubs for @entity256 's $ 20m - a - year mammoth tusk industry , finding mammoth tusks that are large enough to sculpt is becoming increasingly difficult			2
" ( @entity261 ) can only work in summer because the tundra in @entity256 is frozen for the rest of the year and even then they 're having to dig deeper to get the larger tusks , " said one @entity1 trader who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity surrounding all ivory trade			1
" it seems like all the bigger , easy - to - get pieces have already been extracted			0
" despite the legality of the mammoth tusk industry , he said people still come into his shop on @entity1 's fine arts and antiques strip on @entity274 asking to buy elephant ivory			2
" many times , many times ( people ask for ivory )			0
do they know it 's illegal ? some do , some do n't , " he said			0
conservation groups have now targeted what they call the " gang of eight " nations at the center of the illegal ivory trade -- @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity6			1
@entity296 , a senior @entity136 official , said the convention 's ruling committee had " run out of patience " over the ivory issue and last week it moved to toughen up action against the worst offending countries			0
at its final session in @entity137 , @entity136 delegates approved a decision to demand an action plan from the so - called " gang of eight " to reduce the trade in ivory within 12 months			2
if these countries do not meet these targets , delegates said , they would likely be hit with sanctions barring their own legal wildlife and plant trades			0
@entity317 's elephant and rhino expert @entity315 said it was time for countries on ivory trade routes to produce blueprints for curbing the ivory trade			0
" we 've seen trade in illegal ivory double since 2007 and the illegal killing of elephants double since 2005			1
we 're really at the highest levels of illegal killings and illegal trade in two decades , " @entity315 told @entity0			1
" there is a general sense that things are beginning to spin out of control			0
" he said that while @entity6 demand was driving the trade due to its increased economic power and its history of ivory consumption , no other country was doing more in terms of making seizures			1
" unfortunately , it 's just not yet registering a deterrent effect , " he said .			0

@entity1 has amassed a stockpile of tons of seized illegal ivory
last year , authorities seized more than six tons of ivory destined for @entity6
conservation groups say demand in @entity6 is driving the illegal trade
