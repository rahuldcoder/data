-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 got involved in the " @entity4 " controversy thursday by tweeting his response to @entity7 's decision to suspend @entity8 for his inflammatory remarks in a recent @entity11 interview			1
" i remember when tv networks believed in the @entity13 , " he wrote , adding , " it is a messed up situation when @entity16 gets a laugh , and @entity8 gets suspended			1
" the truth is it is a messed up situation when a governor rumored to have his sights on the presidency does n't understand the breadth of the @entity13			1
the @entity23 did not send officials into the office of @entity26 , president of @entity27			0
the @entity28 did not threaten to put @entity8 away , and the @entity29 did n't freeze his bank accounts			2
this is what the @entity13 protects us from -- laws being made that restrict freedom of religion , the press and / or speech			1
it does not protect us from how society responds to the expression of one 's religion , the press or speech			1
@entity8 's boss punished him for his remarks			1
now for those out of the loop , @entity8 -- a 67 - year - old @entity2 native and a star of " @entity4 " who holds a master 's in education -- said , " i never , with my eyes , saw the mistreatment of any black person , " and the black people he worked with " were godly ; they were happy ; no one was singing the blues			1
" he also compared homosexuality to bestiality and quoted a @entity65 verse that essentially said anyone who is an adulterer -- which according to @entity68 , includes " anyone who marries a divorced woman " -- is going to hell			0
there 's a lot to chew on in the interview			1
( to his credit , @entity8 issued somewhat of a mea culpa which , in part , read , " we are all created by the @entity80 and like him , i love all of humanity			0
we would all be better off if we loved @entity82 and loved each other			0
" ) but the interview had a lot for some to be offended by , especially given the number of black , gay and divorced people there are in the @entity90			0
and while conservatives such as @entity93 want to drape @entity8 's remarks with the banner of @entity96 , the truth is not everyone who identifies as a @entity96 subscribes to anti-gay beliefs			1
just as not everyone who identifies as a @entity96 believes black people were happier before the civil rights movement or that marrying a divorced woman is adultery			0
this variation in religious expression in general and @entity96 denomination in particular are also protected by the @entity13			2
not that it really matters			0
@entity8 did n't falsely yell fire in a crowded theater -- which @entity112 @entity111 said was not protected by the @entity13 back in 1919 -- so he is legally free to say whatever he wants to @entity11 about anyone he wants			1
but that does not mean he is protected from how people react to what he says			0
or those who make decisions about advertising			0
this is where @entity1 -- as well as those who believe @entity8 's suspension violates his constitutional right to free speech -- get it wrong			1
you can say some stupid stuff -- whether it 's @entity131 dropping the n - word , @entity133 dropping the f - word , @entity135 using a derogatory word for @entity138 people as he talks about @entity139 -- or @entity140 infamously saying , " ' i think that if rape is inevitable , relax and enjoy it			0
'' -- and the @entity13 will keep you from going to jail			2
but it is not a get - out - of - jail - free card in the eyes of society			2
and if you do n't believe me -- try walking into your boss ' office and call him or her a big fat idiot with ugly children			0
then see if " freedom of speech " helps you keep your job			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			2

" @entity4 " star suspended *due* to controversial remarks in @entity11 interview
@entity158 says it 's a mistake to say the tv network is violating @entity13
@entity13 stops government from limiting free speech , he notes
@entity158 : @entity171 does n't prevent society from responding to hateful speech
