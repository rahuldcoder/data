-- he might have walked alone in a crowd of 15,000 fans , but for one @entity6 soccer fan that lonely experience has resulted in internet stardom			1
the unusual story of @entity11 , who was the only @entity12 supporter to turn up to the club 's top - level away game earlier this week , has swept around the world			1

" when i travel to away matches , there 's about 200 or 80 of us but on monday , because of the time of the game and the location i thought i would n't find more than five or six people there , " he said			2
" when i got there i found out i was the only one			0
i understand that it 's cold now , it 's a long drive plus , the economic crisis does n't help , so people are not moving en masse as you would expect			2
i was lucky because i 'm used to traveling and just happened to be in the area			0
" the stewards at @entity47 gave him the option of sitting in the main stand , but @entity11 chose the deserted away end			2
@entity52 squeeze into @entity54 knockout stages " the home fans started booing , shouting and insulting ... the usual , " he said			0
" but when i saw that the @entity12 players were warming up i shouted out to them saying , ' guys , i 'm all alone here			2
alone ! you can hear me now but you wo n't be able to hear me once the game starts ! ' " when the home fans eventually understood what was happening , they gave me a huge round of applause			0
they were cheering even though @entity19 lost the game in the end			0
they were actually really nice -- they offered me food and coffee and the club manager gave me a shirt , which was nice			0
" @entity11 has since been swamped with media requests as the popularity of his story grew			1
he said he has been invited to a @entity75 game in @entity76 by broadcaster the @entity77 , @entity12 officials have asked him to come to the club 's next home match and @entity6 tv stations " keep calling me			1
" " i do n't think it 's that big a story -- there are so many keen fans that really never miss a game , so i 'm sure i 'm not the first one ! " he said			1
@entity12 , which last season finished third in @entity92 to qualify for the preliminary rounds of @entity95 's top club competition this term , has an average home attendance of 18,000			2
monday 's 2 - 0 win at @entity19 lifted the team into the top half of the table , with captain @entity102 among the scorers			1
he personifies the fierce loyalty the club inspires , refusing lucrative offers to join bigger sides			0
@entity11 , meanwhile , is happy to support anything from his home region			0
" i 'm not a representative of the @entity12 fan club , i 'm just passionate about all things that my region has to offer -- from sports to food and everything inbetween , " said @entity11 , who hails from the town of @entity111			1
" i 've been a @entity12 fan for years , since i was a little boy			1
@entity12 represents my region : if you come from @entity120 , you have to be a @entity12 fan			1
" i always carry a flag and my scarf with me in the car			0
whenever there is a sporting event that involves people from my region i just go along , because i 'm very proud of my origins			0
