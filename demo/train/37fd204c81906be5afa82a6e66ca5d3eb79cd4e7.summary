@entity0 -- @entity2 wo n't know which candidate will represent the state in the next @entity5 until december			0
@entity7 sen. @entity6 and @entity8 rep. @entity8 will face off in a december runoff , @entity1 projects			1
the two candidates also faced off against another @entity15 , tea party - backed col. @entity12 ( ret			0
) in @entity2 's " jungle primary " system			1
the system gave candidates from both parties a chance to slug it out together instead of settling on a nominee in the summer like most states			0
but one candidate has to hit 50 % of the vote to avoid a december runoff			1
the polls have favored a runoff for weeks now , with the no. 3 candidate @entity12 pulling enough votes from the right to keep @entity8 neck - and - neck with @entity6 and below the 50 % threshold			1
@entity6 's rough fight for re-election came amid sagging approval for president @entity37 in the state , where only 40 % of @entity2 voters approved of @entity37 according to a @entity1 / @entity41 poll			2
the three - term incumbent even tied @entity37 's unpopularity in the state to racism in the @entity46 last week			0
" i 'll be very , very honest with you			0
the @entity46 has not always been the friendliest place for african - americans , " @entity6 told @entity49 ' @entity48 , while also citing @entity37 's moratorium on off - shore drilling and energy issues as the " number one " issue for why @entity54 do not like the president			0
" it 's been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader			0
" and while @entity8 hammered @entity6 over those comments , he faced heat over racially - tinged remarks in september when he said @entity68 " runs the @entity66 like a plantation			1
" like many other democrats with tough reelection challenges , @entity6 has kept @entity37 at arm 's length and has sought to deflect @entity15 attacks tying her to the president			2
@entity6 has also faced attacks from her @entity15 opponents over her reputation as one of the @entity66 's most frequent flyers -- billing the federal government more than $ 47,000 in flights in 2013 alone			1
and in september , @entity6 's campaign reimbursed the federal government more than $ 33,000 in flights that should have been billed to her @entity66 office			2

with no candidate reaching the *required* 50 % threshold , the @entity66 race is headed for a dec. runoff
sen. @entity6 will face off against @entity15 rep. @entity8
*tuesday* 's race was a " jungle primary " where candidates from both parties slug it out together
