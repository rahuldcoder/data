@entity0 -- @entity2 and four of her siblings sent a scathing letter to the men who control @entity8 's estate , accusing them of fraud and of abusing their mother			1
" this has to stop now : no more ! ! " the @entity8 siblings wrote in the letter obtained by @entity1			1
the letter also suggested that their mother , @entity15 , suffered a " mini-stroke " recently , which her lawyer quickly disputed			1
@entity19 , fans mark @entity8 's death three years later the controversy even led @entity22 , the late pop star 's 14 - year - old daughter , to use her @entity25 account to weigh in			1
" i am going to clarify right now that what has been said about my grandmother is a rumor and nothing has happened , she is completely fine , " @entity26 tweeted			0
relations between the @entity33 and executors @entity34 and @entity36 have been strained for most of the three years since @entity8 's sudden death from an overdose of an anesthetic used as a sleep aid			2
the letter mostly repeats allegations made by family members , but it also threatens new legal action against @entity34 , an entertainment lawyer , and @entity36 , a music executive , who worked with @entity8 at several points in his career			1
" we know there is most certainly a conspiracy surrounding our brother 's death and now coarse manipulation and fear are being used to cover it up , " they wrote			1
" your heartless pursuit of wealth , fame and power is at the expense of our family , whose deepest desire is to give to the world a gift of hope , love and unity through our music			1
" @entity70 decries ' speculation ' over son 's death it was signed by @entity2 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			1
@entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 did not sign it , nor did parents @entity83 and @entity15			2
" we are saddened that false and defamatory accusations grounded in stale @entity90 conspiracy theories are now being made by certain members of @entity8 's family whom he chose to leave out of his will , " estate spokesman @entity85 said in a statement to @entity1			1
" we are especially disheartened that they come at a time when remarkable progress has been made to secure the financial future of his children by turning around the estate 's finances as well as during a time when so many of @entity8 's fans , old and new , are enjoying his artistry through exciting new projects			1
" the will , which was validated in probate court in the months after @entity8 's june 25 , 2009 , death , put all @entity8 's assets into a trust that benefited his mother , @entity111 ; his children , @entity113 , @entity26 and blanket ; and charities			2
@entity34 and @entity36 were named as executors			0
the signature page indicated that @entity8 signed the will in @entity0 on july 7 , 2002 , on which date the @entity119 say he was in @entity121			0
the siblings ' letter charged that " without question , it 's fake , flawed and fraudulent			1
" @entity126 sues her former accountants " according to what is witnessed in the document , it is impossible and illogical that he could have been in two places at one time , " the letter said			2
" we have evidence that undoubtedly supports and proves that @entity8 was absolutely not in @entity0 , @entity136 , on the date his signature reflected in the will at hand			0
" they also questioned why their brother would name as executors someone he disliked			2
" our brother told us , in no uncertain terms and without hesitation in the months prior to his death , that he despised both of you and that he did not want either of you to have anything to do with his life or estate for that matter , " the letter said			1
" we know that and you know that			0
" courts have already settled the matter , the estate spokesman said			2
" any doubts about the validity of @entity8 's will and his selection of executors were thoroughly and completely debunked two years ago when a challenge was rejected by the @entity167 , the @entity168 and , finally , the @entity136 @entity169 , " @entity85 said			2
the @entity8 brothers and sisters also accuse @entity34 and @entity36 of abusing their 82 - year - old mother through lies and manipulations			0
" your actions are affecting her health , and on top of that , we 've just found out she recently had a mini-stroke			0
please understand , she 's not equipped to handle the stress load you are putting on her , " her children said			2
" she feels , as she has said , ' i 'm stuck in the middle			0
' she too knows and acknowledges the will was forged			0
she wants to do the right thing , and move in the direction of justice for her son and family , yet she fears the @entity196			2
" @entity15 's lawyer @entity197 disputed that she was in poor health			0
@entity199 cancels tour dates " mrs. @entity2 is extremely lucid and does a great job caring for @entity8 's children , " @entity197 said wednesday			1
the siblings also attacked @entity197 , @entity15 's manager , @entity205 , and adviser @entity206 for discouraging her from joining their challenge of the will 's validity			1
" instead , her so - called advisers are convincing her to let them negotiate ' deals ' with @entity34 and @entity36 on her behalf , or is it on the behalf of all of you , " they wrote			0
" her advisers ' loyalty seems to be skewed by the percentage you offer them , preventing them from advising her properly			0
" @entity197 responded that he 's always been available " to speak with or meet with any of mrs. @entity2 's children to answer any questions they might have			1
it is unfortunate that they have n't taken me up on the offer			0
" " anyone who actually knows me knows my only loyalty in this matter is to @entity15 , and the public record of my success for her speaks for itself , " @entity197 said			0
he pointed to success in paying off her $ 14 million civil court judgment to a @entity238 company , persuading the estate not to sell the family 's @entity241 mansion and " helping get her family allowance increased almost tenfold , to name a few			1
" @entity246 keyboardist @entity245 dies the siblings ' letter told the executors they have " dishonored everything our brother stood for			1
" " your greed and hasty business decisions have shown that you have no regard for the preservation of his legacy , nor the quality of work that he exemplified , " they said			0
" you have disrespected our parents and family too many times			0
we do not respect you as executors , and we do n't respect the projects and choices you 've made , nor do we appreciate the public perception that the jackson family is behind all of this , exploiting @entity8 our brother for financial gain , when it 's the two of you and your affiliates who do so			1
" finally , the five @entity119 wrote that they would " take every appropriate action to seek justice and to see to it that the truth be known			0
" " be informed , we are considering retaining a law firm , @entity280 , who have advised us on the potential criminal misconduct in your actions			0
we will hand this over to proper authorities , " they wrote			0
@entity85 said the executors " have diligently carried out their fiduciary duties as well as their obligation to @entity8 to make sure that his estate benefits the only family members he named in his will , his mother and his three children			1
