@entity0 never led a civil rights march , launched a boycott or gave a speech before a cheering crowd of protesters			1
but his impact on @entity7 was as profound as virtually any civil rights leader , says @entity9 , a sociologist who grew up watching " @entity10			1
" @entity0 ' groundbreaking tv show did n't just captivate african - americans -- it tied white and black @entity7 together in a way that had not been done before , says @entity9 , who teaches a course on hip - hop at the @entity16			1
" he was an ambassador , the pope of soul , " @entity9 said			1
" for a lot of suburban whites living in segregated @entity7 , this was their first exposure to this exciting new world of movement and energy			2
he made black culture more accessible			0
" @entity0 , who hosted " @entity10 " for 22 of its 36 years on the air , died tuesday			1
police reports indicate he died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound			0
the suave @entity0 was known by an entire generation of african - americans as the dapper host of " @entity10 " who signed off each show by blowing a kiss and declaring , " we wish you love , peace and souuuullll			1
" most of the tributes to @entity0 that poured in following his death focused on his contribution to music			1
others said his legacy was bigger than sound			0
cultural impact of ' @entity10 ' @entity48 , co-founder of @entity49 , which produced the theme song for " @entity10 , " says @entity0 was a great contributor to @entity7 , not just black , culture			1
" @entity10 , " like @entity54 and @entity55 , is an @entity7 brand , @entity48 says			1
" @entity10 " traditions , like dancers gathering to cheer on fellow dancers as they shimmied down a dance line , are now a part of pop culture			2
" no matter where you go in this world , people are doing the ' @entity10 ' dance line , " he said			2
" what 's a party without the ' @entity10 ' dance line ? " @entity48 still sounded stunned after hearing the news about @entity0			1
" unbelievable , " he said			0
" that was my man			0
" singer @entity72 told @entity73 that @entity0 was an unsung hero whose show amplified the message , " i 'm black and i 'm proud			1
" " he encouraged us to be ourselves , " she said			0
" we 're going to give you this platform and you go out and do your thing			0
" sociologist @entity9 said that message -- be black and proud -- drove the civil rights movement			1
and just as the civil rights movement overturned segregation , @entity0 erased cultural barriers that separated white and black @entity85 living apart in their own cultural cocoons			1
" i see @entity0 as a civil rights activist , " said @entity9 , author of " @entity87			2
" " the civil rights movement changed the legal structure ; @entity0 changed the cultural structure			1
changing the culture can change hearts in a way that protests ca n't			0
" @entity0 first changed television			2
tv had not been known as friendly terrain for @entity85 before " @entity10			2
" blacks were often seen in caricatured roles -- as minstrels , servants or outlaws			0
they were seen through the lens of white @entity7			2
" @entity10 " changed the focus			2
it lifted the veil on black @entity7 and showed blacks being themselves , and not as whites imagined them , said @entity9			1
" the show introduced the notion that blacks were creative , we have something to offer and we 're not going anywhere			0
and if you give us a chance , you might like some of our moves , " @entity9 said			0
@entity0 offered white @entity7 a new way to see black men , @entity9 says			1
he was n't a sidekick or servant , nor was he angry			0
" he walked a tightrope , " @entity9 said			0
" if he was too in - your - face , he would have been offensive on television , or too accommodating he would have been perceived as an @entity127			0
" he was soooo cool			0
" the cool apparently was n't an act to those who knew him and knew how he launched " @entity10			1
" the man behind the voice @entity0 took a big risk to start " @entity10			1
" he was a former insurance salesman who entered broadcasting in the mid- 1960s			0
he gave up a steady paycheck as a salesman because he 'd often been told he had a wonderful voice for broadcasting			0
he was inspired by another television music host			2
" almost all of what i learned about mounting and hosting a dance show i learned from @entity143 , " the producer and host of " @entity146 , " he once told @entity140			2
@entity0 was used to taking risks -- he used $ 400 of his own money to shoot a pilot and faced skepticism at many turns			2
yet he had an edge -- " @entity10 " was a novel idea			2
there had been any number of radio programs focusing on black music and black listeners , but " @entity10 " was the first nationwide black - oriented music - variety tv show			1
it was also one of the most successful tv programs ever : to this day , its 35 years in syndication are a record			0
" if you 're an @entity85 of a certain age , ' @entity10 ' was as important to your weekend mornings as your milk was to your cereal , " broadcasting personality @entity164 wrote in 2010			2
@entity0 also was a shrewd businessman			2
he used a partnership with @entity172 and @entity174 - based cosmetics company @entity173 to take the show national in 1971 after a year 's run in @entity174			0
he also stayed true to his market -- and by doing so helped popularize @entity85 - @entity7 artists among a wide audience			0
he gave a number of black performers their big break , including @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 -- the latter two as dancers			0
@entity10 's fashions the fashions on " @entity10 " were almost as important as the music			1
every saturday , teenagers all across @entity7 tuned in to see what the " @entity10 " dancers were wearing			1
viewers even paid attention to the commercials , where companies sold black beauty products such as @entity198			0
" it was appointment television in our household , and the clothes were talked about as much if not more than the new dance moves , " said @entity204 magazine editor @entity203			0
" the style of ' @entity10 ' is a book , a movie , a documentary in and of itself			0
it was flashy , it was big , it was bold , it was sexy -- and frankly it was a way that i think many in @entity7 had n't seen african - americans look			0
to just even see people from another part of the country -- people forget how revolutionary that was back in the ' 70s			0
" no matter how popular " @entity10 " became , @entity0 never forgot those who worked behind the stage , said @entity225 , author of " a @entity226 on @entity227			1
" " he wanted to make sure that he had african - americans involved in every level of production			0
he had @entity85 - @entity7 directors , and of course he had @entity85 - @entity7 dancers , " @entity225 told @entity73 's @entity231			1
" if there had not been a ' @entity10 ' there would not have been a whole network like @entity238 that tries to do on a network level what @entity0 did on a program level			1
" in his later years , @entity0 became an elder statesman for the black music scene			1
he would show up at awards shows -- impeccably tailored as usual -- to receive accolades for " @entity10			1
" looking at him then , it was hard to imagine the risks he took when he started " @entity10			0
" but @entity249 's @entity248 remembered			0
once , @entity250 -- then the biggest name in soul music -- wondered how @entity0 would succeed			1
" who 's backing you on this ? " he asked @entity253 repeatedly			0
" it 's just me , @entity250 , " @entity0 answered			1
@entity0 ' wonderful voice -- like the music and style of " @entity10 " -- is now a permanent part of @entity7 's soundtrack .			1

" @entity10 " host @entity0 ' impact on @entity7 was bigger than music
" he was an ambassador , the pope of soul , " one sociologist says
show 's message was " i 'm black and i 'm proud , " @entity72 says
stars and fans *praised* his cool persona , boldness and cultural " tightrope " act
