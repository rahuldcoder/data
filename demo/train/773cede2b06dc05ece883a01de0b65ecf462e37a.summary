-- @entity1 are revolting -- against their leaders and established political parties , against an austerity plan ' made in @entity5 ' , and against a future that promises declining living standards and shriveling public services			1
within the past few days , @entity9 have fled to opposite ends of the spectrum , with significant numbers voting for far - left and far - right parties that were but specks on the political landscape two years ago			1
the @entity16 turfed out the president who wanted to make them more competitive and less indebted -- and voted for a candidate pledged to reversing the recent rise in the retirement age			1
two million voters deliberately spoiled their ballot papers after the leader of the far - right @entity25 said that 's what she would do			2
in local elections in @entity31 both parties in the ruling coalition were rebuffed			1
the left and protest groups did well in @entity34 's local elections monday , with former prime minister @entity36 's party taking a beating			1
comedian @entity38 , who wants @entity34 to default on its debt , took 21 % of the vote in the city of @entity43			1
and in @entity5 sunday , chancellor @entity44 was snubbed in a state election -- voters apparently weary of @entity5 's hard - earned " fiscal rectitude " being tarnished by those spendthrift @entity49 types			1
even if @entity1 is financially out of intensive care -- after a series of summits that basically endorsed @entity5 's blueprint for the future and sought to stabilize the banking system -- the economic and employment outlook remains grim			1
in response to popular discontent , the rhetoric is changing : less stress on austerity , more on engineering growth			0
hence @entity44 's olive branch to @entity16 's new @entity72 president , @entity71 : " we are talking about two sides of the same coin -- progress is only achievable via solid finances plus growth			2
" but one @entity44 ally -- @entity74 of the @entity75 -- was less tactful			0
" there will not be new public programs to boost activity , such as the ( opposition ) @entity5 @entity81 and @entity71 are calling for , " he told a @entity5 newspaper			2
@entity71 has vowed not to endorse the @entity83 's treaty on fiscal discipline without new growth initiatives			0
if he means it , the markets wo n't like it			0
chances are , according to @entity90 of @entity91 , that it was fodder for the campaign trail			0
" his @entity83 growth agenda means little in actual policy substance , " @entity90 wrote monday			0
" a shift in policy rhetoric , which @entity5 chancellor @entity44 has already been tacking toward , should prove sufficient to keep relations on track			1
" so , discard a crisis in @entity105 - @entity5 relations , and look for a vague compromise instead -- plus a guerrilla war on whether the @entity108 should be in the stimulus business			1
whatever government is formed in @entity9 , and it will likely be a makeshift coalition , it wo n't push @entity1 into diluting the medicine			1
the options for whoever takes office in @entity116 are stark : stay the internationally - prescribed course and receive further support ; or go cold turkey and exit the eurozone			0
the @entity9 electorate , after seeing their incomes fall ( on average ) by nearly one - third in three years , are in a foul and volatile mood			1
and next month , whoever is in power in @entity116 has to find another $ 15 billion in spending cuts to keep international creditors happy			2
this might politely be described as uncharted waters			0
the old parties of center - left and center - right are short of a parliamentary majority even if they agree to combine , while @entity136 , replete with its neo-nazi symbolism and threatening a war on immigrants , suddenly has 21 deputies			1
the headline in the @entity9 newspaper @entity142 monday , with no hint of hyperbole : " @entity145			2
" essentially , the @entity1 politicians so reviled by the voters have little room to maneuver			2
neither @entity5 nor the financial markets will entertain increased borrowing or backsliding on targets to cut deficits			2
@entity5 proposals for labor reforms to make @entity1 more competitive are a long - term enterprise			1
so is chipping away at public debt that has swollen over the past decade and more			0
in @entity9 and across much of @entity1 , younger voters are suffering the highest rates of unemployment and are flocking to the political margins			1
in the 17 countries of the eurozone more than one - tenth of the labor force is idle , according to the latest statistics from @entity165			0
fifty one percent of @entity166 under 25 are out of work while @entity34 unemployment hit a 12 - year high in march			1
@entity166 's new @entity171 government has intensified spending cuts and is putting pressure on the spendthrift regional governments to get their budgets balanced			0
in january , the central government had to step in to ensure the city of @entity178 could repay a $ 160 million debt to @entity180 , while @entity166 banks have suffered a sharp rise in bad loans , and property prices continue to crumble			0
@entity34 's situation is similarly parlous			2
its technocratic government is trying to identify spending cuts to avert a rise in the top rate of sales tax ( known as @entity192 ) to 23 %			0
the government expects the economy to contract 1.2 % this year -- hardly the sort of performance that will get people back to work			0
writing in the @entity200 last october , former @entity31 prime minister @entity199 described a @entity1 scenario that seemed like the economic equivalent of @entity204 's " @entity203			1
" the southern states " must devalue their living standards and promote reforms to enhance efficiency			0
meanwhile , wages must fall , unemployment will rise and social unrest will increase			0
the severity of this medicine may not be bearable in a liberal democracy			0
" and when @entity199 was prime minister , he was never one to exaggerate .			0

political leaders who supported austerity , cuts suffer election defeats across @entity1
*anti-austerity* votes seen in @entity16 , @entity9 , @entity31 , @entity34 and even @entity5
far - right , far - left and protest groups do well
but whoever is in power austerity seems to remain the key economic policy
