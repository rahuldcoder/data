if you thought the @entity1 was rough , " @entity6 " promises more blood and brutality when it returns to @entity4 for its fourth season on sunday night ( april 6 )			1
the season picks up in the aftermath of the devastating wedding reception from hell , which proved , in case it was still unclear to anyone , that in the world crafted by novelist @entity15 in his " @entity17 " fantasy series , no one is ever safe			1
unlike some series , this season does not take long to heat up			1
in @entity21 , brutal @entity19 ( @entity20 ) is due to be married in an elaborate affair that will bring together a slew of characters , some old and some new , to -- er -- celebrate			1
what could possibly go wrong ? for one , siblings - with - benefits @entity29 ( @entity30 ) and @entity31 ( @entity32 ) are back together for the first time since @entity29 was captured , and partially butchered , in season three , with all the awkwardness that entails			1
we 've already seen that @entity36 ( @entity37 ) ends up in major trouble ( what else is new ? ) and that new character @entity40 ( @entity41 ) -- will be attending the joyous occasion with less - than - love in his heart for the @entity44			1
as for our other main players : @entity47 ( @entity46 ) , with an army of freed slaves at her back and a trio of increasingly formidable dragons to keep in line , confronts the promise , and pitfalls , of her ascent to true power			1
after narrowly missing a longed - for reunion with her family , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) and @entity60 ( @entity61 ) face what comes next			1
as bits of her back story come together , @entity58 will become arguably season four 's first true scene stealer			1
at @entity71 , the coming war between the wildlings and the @entity70 simmers to a boil , with @entity73 ( @entity74 ) caught awkwardly in the middle			1
look for this conflict to spur some of the epic battle scenes the series , and @entity15 's novels , are known for			1
and what of the @entity81 ? elsewhere , @entity82 ( @entity83 ) is down but not out after his defeat on the @entity85 and turns increasingly to the creepy " @entity86 ( @entity87 ) for answers			1
@entity89 , with @entity90 and friends , continues his mystical trip north to seek what his " green dreams " really mean			1
and , for those of us who can stand to look , we 'll see the continuing travails of poor , tortured @entity98			1
in september , i hosted a pair of panels at @entity102 with cast members from the show			1
@entity107 ( lord commander @entity108 ) , @entity111 ( @entity112 , the @entity113 whose actions lead to chaos at @entity115 ) and @entity116 ( wildling @entity117 ) talked about what it means to be a part of the massively popular series			1
below are some excerpts from those panels : ( editor 's note : contains spoilers for season three of the show			1
) on what has made the show beloved by so many fans : @entity129 : if i knew that , i 'd be a really rich man			1
i have worked on lots of historical stuff , but i think " @entity6 " ticks so many boxes for so many people			1
and its production values are so high , continuously			1
it 's just set a new standard for that sort of television			1
as far as identifying what it is , i think these shows come along once in a lifetime that people just embrace and it becomes something really special			2
the books that @entity15 had written were so well - loved by so many people , and ( show runners ) @entity149 and @entity151 brought that to the screen so beautifully			2
@entity153 : i think it 's because it 's got that " @entity157 " magic , with just a hunk of sex and death thrown at it			2
and i think that 's something we all have a link to and it 's also how i imagine the medieval world to be -- brutish and short and sexual			2
@entity129 : when you said that it was " @entity157 " with great sex and violence thrown at it -- well , the sex bit missed me			2
i am the only guy there who 's got this crew of guys and we 're all celibate			2
on the intense fan reactions to the show : @entity153 : when you 're working you do n't think about what something means			2
you 're just thinking about playing a moment , and a truth			2
i can see now that it means a lot to so many people and that 's humbling			2
but in the moment you 're just trying to do the best job you can			2
@entity129 : when we were doing it , i had no concept about how huge it was going to become			2
i do n't know if anyone did			2
but from reading the part of @entity108 , i just loved the character			2
he was the one who stood out to me as a man of such innate dignity			2
it was just a joy to play			2
on memorable moments from the set : @entity153 : we skinned a rabbit			1
... ( a forest ranger ) just plunked a rabbit in front of me and @entity208 ( @entity207 , who plays @entity209 ) and he showed us how to do it			0
and , it was fine			0
but when we did it on the day , after skinning 40 rabbits and pulling their heads off ... all of it congealed			1
it was a hot day and by the end of the day , i had flies all over my hands			0
i did go a bit mad			0
i had , like , three showers			0
everyone thinks fish smell and you do n't really think about meat			0
meat , by the end of the day , is horrible			0
i was , like , " out , damn spot ! " pulling their heads off as well -- that was pretty interesting			0
we ran out of rabbits , so sometimes we had to kind of plunk bits of the bodies back together			1
it was a special day			0
@entity111 : i wanted to talk about pig s * * * , if that 's all right			1
that 's what i noticed most in @entity241			0
it 's like this really glamorous show and i turn up and it 's like , literally , 3 - feet depth of pig mess everywhere			1
i could n't believe it			0
i only had a week there and i was like , " i 'm done			0
" on how he learned his character would die @entity129 : i 'm a dedicated fly fisherman			0
i fish quite a lot up in @entity252 for steelhead			0
and my fishing buddy who 's a few years older than me , @entity256 -- he has n't read many books in his life			0
but when i said i 'm doing this thing , " @entity6 , " he said , " oh , man			1
i 'm going to get these books			0
" we 'd be standing up to our waist , trying to catch steelhead in the river ... and he 'd say , " well , i got to chapter 23 last night			0
you 're still there , kid			0
" and then it came to book three and he says , " i ca n't see you anywhere , man			0
he 's not talking about you			0
" so that was my conduit to learning where my career was going -- this old guy standing next to me while we were fishing			0
on the show 's @entity279 - winning costumes @entity129 : as you get helped into the leggings and the big leather chest piece and then the cloak , you can feel the sort of gravitas of the character coming			0
even the way you walk is informed by these things that drag along behind you ; you 're almost pulling your cloak behind you			0
costuming is a hugely important part of building the character and i would n't have it any other way			0
it does help , although at times it can be a bit annoying and cumbersome			0
it must have been about 50 - 60 pounds when it was on			0
as you see , i 'm a lightweight kind of guy ( his agency says he is 6 - foot - 1 and weighs about 240 pounds )			1
but i know when i was wearing all the costume and i was about to get on my horse , he looked really , really unhappy			0
@entity153 : with every single character you play , your costume is your outward appearance to the world			0
... that immediately determines how the world , and you yourself , see you .			0
