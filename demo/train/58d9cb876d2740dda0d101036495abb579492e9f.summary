... i might not have learned these things , " @entity5 once said in 2000 during an interview with the @entity47			1
he said reading biographies helped him realize problems make some people , while destroying others			2
his mother and eldest son both died while he was imprisoned			0
while he had ample reason to remain bitter about his mistreatment , instead he wrote in " @entity62 , " his 1995 autobiography , " @entity55 is itself a tremendous education in the need for patience and perseverance			0
it is , above all , a test of one 's commitment			2
" do n't judge a book by its cover " i have been surprised a great deal sometimes when i see somebody who looks less than ordinary , but when you talk to the person and he ( or she ) opens his mouth , he is something completely different , " @entity5 said in the same interview about how his prison experience taught him to respect even the most ordinary people			1
@entity79 , an associate professor of communication at @entity81 in @entity82 said avoiding the temptation to put people in narrowly fixed categories is one of @entity5 's greatest legacies			1
" people are complex and dynamic , capable of change and evolving , " @entity79 said			0
it would have been easy for @entity5 to become and remain jaded after what he had experienced , @entity79 added			1
even for the people who kept @entity5 locked up , the former president said they were n't bad people			1
" mr @entity5 was at pains to point out that not every prison warder or apartheid official was bad			1
this view was underpinned throughout by his assertion that to get along in life one should see the good in all people , " said a @entity98 of @entity100 statement on a collection of writings about his prison time			0

" you want to create an atmosphere where you can move everybody toward the goal you have set for yourself			0
" remaining focused on a goal despite adversity requires a deep level of commitment			0
ask anyone whose ever overcome great odds to achieve their version of greatness			0
@entity79 said different situations are going to draw different things out people , but it 's never as simple as distilling the experience down to a " type of person			1
" practically none of us knows how we will react in complex situations and interactions			0
change yourself first " one of the most difficult things is not to change society -- but to change yourself , " @entity5 said in 1999 at a tribute to billionaire businessman @entity144 , who had made his @entity146 residence available to @entity5 as a retreat after his prison release in 1990			1
while @entity5 clearly fought for change in the world he lived in , he also changed himself			1
while imprisoned , he reflected on his " wild man " behaviors			0
he also said he neglected to show any gratitude to those who had helped him when he was poor , after he experienced some success as a lawyer			0
@entity79 points out his change from violence to peace was profound			0

" he was keen to dispel any notion of sainthood that might be bestowed on him			0
to this day , @entity5 's weaknesses , his turbulent youth and his sometimes tempestuous relationships with women can still detract from the iconic status that @entity5 achieved in his own lifetime			1
" but , the responsible airing of his weaknesses -- including his own acknowledgment -- in fact humanized @entity5 and focused on his extraordinary strength of character and commitment in overcoming both his weaknesses and adversity in his own lifetime			2
it augmented @entity5 's greatness			1

" before meeting visiting dignitaries or political adversaries in five - star hotel conference rooms , @entity5 made sure to approach the security guards , servers and other workers outside to shake their hands , @entity235 wrote			2
they went wild when @entity5 concluded his final statement during a conference by offering his hand to @entity256 , @entity22 's last apartheid - era president , as an expression of unity , saying that despite their differences , he was willing to work with his adversary			1
@entity263 had little choice but to grasp it			0
" i look at not only how people treat me , but how they treat others , " @entity79 said			0
" sometimes this ( how they treat others ) is more important			0
" a simple handshake , @entity79 said , can convey to others that the person making the gesture is demonstrating the belief that , " this person has value , has a perspective			2
" maintain a sense of humor " you sharpen your ideas by reducing yourself to the level of the people you are with and a sense of humor and a complete relaxation , even when you 're discussing serious things , does help to mobilise friends around you			2
and i love that , " @entity5 said in a 2005 interview , published by the @entity290			2
at election rallies in 1994 , @entity235 wrote , @entity5 repeatedly elicited trilling howls of ululation from women of all ages when he explained how voters should search their ballots for the picture of the " very handsome young man " -- referring to himself -- to mark their support for the @entity301			2
