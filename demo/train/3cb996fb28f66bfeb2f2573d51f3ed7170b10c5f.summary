@entity0 , @entity1 -- every day , before sunrise , @entity3 wakes to pray , then spends hours more singing praises to @entity6 under a tree outside her home			1
she reflects on the setting and thanks @entity6 for the beautiful environment around her in this small @entity13 town			0
but this @entity15 woman was n't always at peace with herself , or her religion			0
her 55 years have been a journey from wanting to be white to being proud to be black ; from the urban @entity19 to the @entity20 ; from studying religions to finding a community in @entity23			1
as a young girl in the 1960s , " i would have done anything in the world to be white with blue eyes and blonde hair with small lips , " @entity3 said			1
" i did n't hang out with girls who were dark like me , because i felt like they were ugly like me			0
" she became more comfortable with her race as a teenager , when she heard a different message : @entity37 singing " say it loud , i 'm black and i 'm proud ! " " i was , like , ' wow , this is interesting , ' " she said			2
" i started getting rid of [ my relaxed hairstyle ] and accepting my hair natural , and i was a little bit more comfortable with myself			0
" but her pride in her roots did n't fill the void she felt in her heart			0
she was still searching for connections that transcended ethnicity			0
her mother , a @entity49 , encouraged @entity3 to visit various churches around her home in @entity52 , some led by @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
she was 17 when a blind date with a @entity15 man ended at a mosque			2
" i heard the adhan [ call to prayer ] playing , and i saw the people with their long garbs on , and the sisters -- and i just did n't want to leave , " she said			0
that same year , she embraced @entity23 , attracted to the message of peace and its disregard for color			1
" @entity23 helped me to identify with the beauty within as well as outside			1
... it balanced me out because now i understand who i am as a human , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 ' spiritual journey had only begun			2
at age 42 , she moved from @entity52 to @entity1 to escape the crowds of the city with her four children			2
she did n't know of a mosque in the little town where she 'd settled , @entity0 , but was reluctant to go 30 miles south to @entity79			1
so , she prayed about it			0
one day , @entity3 said , she saw men in kufis , traditional @entity84 skullcaps , building what looked like a little house on what had once been known as the " whites - only " side of @entity0			1
she discovered it was to be a mosque , just as she 'd prayed for			2
today , the mosque , @entity93 , is a small white brick building whose members are mostly @entity96			1
they practice mainstream @entity23 , like 2.45 million other @entity96 muslims , not @entity97 , a separate religious tradition associated with black @entity15			1
here , they marry @entity23 ritual , racial understanding and traditional southern culture			1
at the mosque , @entity3 met a spiritual mentor , sheikh @entity103			1
@entity104 was born in @entity105 , @entity106 , and came to @entity1 in 1994 after marrying an @entity96			1
" i belong to a very large family , and generation after generation all we have done is to lead people to the way of @entity6 , " @entity104 said			0
" so , when i got here , the first thing i wanted was a mosque where i can call the people to @entity6 and teach them @entity23			1
and that is what i do			0
" he opened the mosque in 1996 , with five people			2
the congregation now consists of more than 150 members			0
@entity3 was among its first members			2
she was initially attracted to the mosque 's welcoming nature , open - door policy and community outreach			2
over the last 14 years , the mosque has assisted thousands of people in need , many of them homeless and ex-convicts			0
" anybody , @entity15 , @entity136 , you know , @entity96 , @entity138 - @entity96 , anybody who comes and knocks on that door and said ' i 'm hungry , ' or ' i ca n't pay my light bill , ' or ' i need to lay down here and sleep , ' we do n't care who you are , where you come from			1
you could be the worst crook in the world , we really would n't know , " said @entity147 , the prayer leader of the mosque who fills in when @entity104 is absent			0
the mosque 's fusion of black @entity96 and @entity23 culture has allowed members like @entity3 to harmonize her identity and connect with a message of unity			1
" when i came and listened to the sheikh and he spoke about @entity6 and the @entity162 , it was n't about ' black power this , ' and ' black man that , ' " @entity3 said			2
" it was about humanity			0
" it 's like you have a veil when you come into the mosque and all of a sudden the veil is lifted and you can see like you 've never seen before			0
" the center is a unique cultural crossroads in the @entity178 , said @entity179 , an instructor at @entity180 in @entity181 , @entity1 , who has studied the mosque and how its members incorporate @entity23 rituals into their daily lives			1
" when you go for their @entity189 [ holiday ] dinners in particular , this is where you really see both southern hospitality emerge and ... southern home cooking , but everything 's halal , so it shows that religious mandating as well , " said @entity179			2
" [ it ] represents a growing trend in contemporary @entity15 communities in the @entity201 in terms of that fusion of traditional cultures with the @entity96 culture , while maintaining a pride in their @entity23 identity			1
" @entity3 enjoys the duality and expresses her culture through her clothing , head scarf and singing @entity84 - influenced @entity23 prayers , a practice uncommon in other mosques			1
" it makes me feel happy			0
it makes me feel a serenity that words can not describe , because i 'm closer to @entity6 with the community , " she said			0
" everyone is singing and praising @entity6 together			0
" for @entity3 , finding a mosque in the rural @entity20 was key to her inner peace			1
it fulfilled the spiritual companionship she 'd been seeking for years , she said			0
" this community means a family that i never had and a strength that i never knew , " she said			0
" [ it ] meant opening up doors that were shut in terms of my self esteem , in terms of my direction , my aim ... my destiny			0
" she paused to rearrange her scarf , and her eyes began to water			0

@entity3 *struggled* with her race and religious identity early in life .
in rural @entity0 , @entity1 , she joined a mosque that helped her feel whole .
the *predominantly* @entity96 , 150 - member mosque combines traditional @entity23 with southern culture .
