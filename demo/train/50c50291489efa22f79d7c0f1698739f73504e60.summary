-- @entity1 has n't released an album since 2006â € ²s " @entity3 , " mostly because he has been distracted by the business of being @entity1			1
that tends to fill one 's day with acting in @entity8 - winning films , dropping into the occasional snl sketch , hosting a golf tournament , sometimes going to the @entity11 and being engaged to @entity12			0
it 's a busy life , which is why our eyebrows raised when we saw these quotes from a producer named @entity18 , who claims to be working with @entity1 on a series of songs for a " crazy " new album			1
considering @entity1 's stature and the types of people he has worked with in the past , why would he hook up with a dude nobody has ever heard of ? it turns out ... he would n't			2
according to @entity1 's publicist , there are currently no plans for a new album , though @entity1 is working with @entity34 on tracks for " @entity36 " ( he appeared on each of the first two installments of the series )			1
but as for other music , " that 's it , " said the spokesperson			0
that makes a lot more sense for @entity1 , who 's now pretty much entirely focused on acting			2
in fact , he 's currently in @entity47 with @entity48 filming the movie " @entity53 , " which would certainly get in the way of his being in the studio			0
so while the idea of a new @entity1 album is titillating ( especially for those of us still obsessed with " @entity59 " ) , it will have to remain a fantasy for now			2
but it does bring up a good question : what other musicians have walked away on top the way @entity1 did ? while he has n't been completely invisible ( he has dropped in on tracks for @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity34 and @entity69 , among others , since the release of " @entity3 " ) , he has pretty much put the idea of an album on the back burner â € ” though he may be dipping his toe into the world of film scores			1
