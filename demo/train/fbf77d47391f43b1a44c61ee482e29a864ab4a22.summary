-- as harrowing images from the @entity2 grieve the world , notice something that is n't happening : we are not hearing much debate about the connection between tropical cyclones and global climate change			1
in 2007 , the @entity10 released a report warning that rising temperatures would lead to more frequent and violent storms			1
last year , the panel tempered that conclusion			2
while warmer water makes cyclones more likely -- and while a higher sea level makes these tropical storms more dangerous -- changes in wind patterns might counteract those dangers			2
for @entity23 in particular , 2013 has proved the calmest hurricane season since 2002			2
yet hurricanes are only one example of an extreme weather event			2
in january 2013 , the @entity28 surveyed shocks around the world : " @entity31 is enduring its coldest winter in nearly 30 years			2
@entity33 is in the grip of a dreadful heat spell			2
eastern @entity36 is so freezing -- minus 50 degrees @entity37 , and counting -- that the traffic lights recently stopped working in the city of @entity40			2
" " @entity42 fires are raging across @entity43 , fueled by a record - shattering heat wave			2
@entity45 was inundated by unexpected flooding in september			2
a vicious storm bringing rain , snow and floods just struck the @entity50			0
and in the @entity23 , scientists confirmed this week what people could have figured out simply by going outside : last year was the hottest since records began			0
" when we talk about climate change , we are talking about two issues that are too often treated as one : is climate change occurring ? if so , is it changing because of human activity ? the strong passions aroused by question 2 - and the huge economic interests at stake - can lead people to prejudge question 1			1
and within question 1 are two further subquestions : how harmful is climate change ? how rapidly is the change coming ? greenhouse gases near record 39.6 million tons in 2013 some wisdom on these questions may be found in an important new work of history , " @entity75			1
" it 's @entity77 's examination of the last great climate shock experienced by human beings : the @entity78			1
after a half millennium of very benign temperatures , the @entity80 began gradually to cool after about 1550			0
slow cooling plunged into deep freeze in about 1620			1
over the next half - century , the peoples of the @entity80 suffered climate catastrophe after climate catastrophe : over the winter of 1620 - 21 , the @entity88 dividing @entity89 from @entity90 ( in modern - day @entity91 ) froze for the one and only time in recorded history			1
the summer of 1627 was the wettest recorded in @entity89 for 500 years , followed in 1628 by one of the coldest summers recorded			0
in 1641 , the @entity97 that connected @entity98 -- the planet 's greatest city -- to its food supply in southern @entity31 dried up for lack of rain , again for the only time in recorded history			0
@entity31 suffered repeated crop failures through the 1640s because of patterns of drought and excessive rain			0
1641 saw the third - coldest summer recorded in the @entity80 ; 1642 , the 28th coldest ; 1643 , the 10th coldest			0
crops failed across the @entity111 and central @entity89 three harvests in a row			0
the winter of 1649 was the coldest recorded in @entity31			0
in 1657 , @entity116 froze solid , and farther south , people could walk across the ice of the @entity119			0
the next year , 1658 , the @entity120 froze so hard that a @entity122 army and all its artillery could march over what is usually ocean water the 20 miles from @entity126 to @entity127			0
@entity128 recorded 109 days of frost in 1666 - 67 , compared to an average of 63 days in recent years			0
@entity132 's @entity131 froze so hard that thousands of people could use it as a walkway for six weeks during the winter of 1683 - 84			0
these extreme events are just a few of the hundreds of individual examples cited in @entity77 's deeply learned history of the period			0
" @entity75 " was published this spring by @entity141			1
@entity77 is best known as a military historian specializing in the @entity143 , the conflict that ripped apart @entity144 between 1618 and 1648 , killing maybe one - third of the population by violence , hunger and disease			0
climate change : why nations , not global talks , are leading the fight now in a hugely ambitious , late - career work spanning the entire globe , he synthesizes the horrifying violence that erupted across @entity157 during the coldest and hungriest years of the @entity78 : the overthrow of @entity31 's @entity159 and conquest of the world 's most populous country by invaders from @entity164 ; civil wars in @entity166 and northern @entity167 ; the collapse of @entity170 power ; pogroms against the @entity172 of @entity173 , the worst mass killing of @entity172 between the @entity175 and the @entity176 ; @entity178 's merciless war upon the @entity179 ; the destruction of @entity128 , till then @entity89 's largest state ; the @entity183 rebellion in @entity184 ; the @entity132 civil war ; @entity187 's rampage through @entity188 ; the successful @entity191 and doomed @entity190 rebellion against the @entity192 -- all of it accompanied by pestilence and famines , culminating in the last great bubonic plague epidemic in @entity89 history in the 1660s			1
@entity89 enjoyed only three years of complete peace between 1600 and 1700			0
historians are familiar with the statistic that one - third of @entity144 died during the @entity143			1
@entity77 suggests that this figure could be extended across almost the whole landmass from @entity205 to the @entity206 , with @entity31 suffering most and worst			1
the @entity78 was obviously not man - made			0
the sun emitted a little less energy in the 17th century than we are used to , and more volcanoes erupted than usual			1
for tens of millions of human beings , the consequences of these unexpected events was miserable and fatal : death by violence , death by disease , death by hunger			1
@entity77 hammers home the lesson again and again : what matters most about climate change is not how it is caused , but how fast it takes place			1
our contemporary debates over climate all seem to take for granted that change will unfold gradually over the next century , granting us all plenty of warning and time to react			1
in the 17th century , the catastrophe arrived astonishingly fast -- in one human lifetime -- and human beings adapted by dying in droves			1
there is in @entity77 's telling only one exception to the unhappy story : the @entity239 of the shoguns , where effective leaders found ways to manage and mitigate disasters they could not understand			0
if preparedness for the worst was possible for some human beings in those prescientific days , surely it is possible for more of us in our advanced age ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			1

@entity251 : when we *discuss* climate change we act as if we have decades to prepare
he says climate can change astonishingly fast , as it did in global cooling of 17th century
the results were *devastating* , as millions died in famines and war , he writes
@entity268 : " @entity75 " chronicles *tremendous* human suffering as result of climate
