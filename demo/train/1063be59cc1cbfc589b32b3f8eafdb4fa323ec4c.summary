-- what must it be like to step to the plate for your first appearance as a major - league baseball player and knock a grand - slam home run into the far reaches of the seats in @entity10 ? or to walk onto a @entity12 field for the first time in your life , receive a kickoff while standing in the end zone , and return it 103 yards for a touchdown ? very few people know that feeling -- the feeling of , against all probability , achieving magnificence on the very first try			0
when he died earlier this month at the age of 86 , most of the obituaries and remembrances were centered on his role as the lovable , quietly wise sheriff @entity30 in the long - running television series " the @entity32			1
" which only made sense : that program , and that character , were so popular that when people hear @entity24 's name , they almost automatically also hear in their heads the peppy , whistling theme music from the show			1
he , and the show , symbolized a sunny @entity44 that thrived on common sense and good intentions			0
yet , in the minds of some of us , @entity24 's crowning achievement came at the outset of his career , the first time he appeared in a motion picture			2
the job he did was so stunning -- and so directly opposite in tone from the sheriff @entity24 character that would later define him -- that watching the movie today is a revelation			1
the movie was called " @entity60			1
" those of you who have seen it are likely nodding your heads in appreciation right now ; those of you who have n't are in for a treat			0
you thought you knew how good the guy was at his job ? just wait			0
you wo n't have to wait long			0
as part of a tribute to @entity24 's career , @entity70 is presenting a special airing of " @entity60 " wednesday at 8 p.m. et. @entity70 and @entity0 are corporate siblings , but i would be recommending " @entity60 " to you if i 'd heard it was being screened in a church basement , or in the most rundown revival theater on some desolate downtown corner			1
released in 1957 , the movie told the story of @entity83 , a drifter we first see in a rural @entity86 jail cell			2
he is interviewed by a small - town radio reporter played by @entity88 , and the film follows his rise to radio , and then television , stardom , and what eventually transpires			1
@entity24 made audiences love him as the kindly sheriff @entity32 ; as @entity60 , he had the courage as an actor to dare audiences to hate him			1
you can not take your eyes off him			0
in his may 29 , 1957 , review of the movie in the @entity104 , critic @entity101 wrote that screenwriter @entity105 and director @entity106 had managed to " spawn a monster not unlike the one of @entity108			0
" and as you watch the first - time movie actor @entity24 , @entity101 wrote , " you know you are in the vicinity of someone who has white lightning for blood			1
" @entity105 was on a remarkable three - year run at the time ; between 1954 and 1957 he had a hand in three unforgettable movies about the dark side of @entity44 life : " @entity124 " with @entity121 , " @entity123 " with @entity122 , and " @entity60			1
" as laceratingly first - rate as @entity105 's writing and @entity106 's direction were , the film would not have worked had the lead actor failed to be convincing as a person whose hungers were so self - centered and all - consuming that he would do anything and step on anyone to get what he wanted			2
@entity24 pulled it off seamlessly : as you watch him , you understand how the smiling , aw - shucks , i 'm - just - a - country - boy @entity60 could cynically use the then - new medium of national television to become as powerful as the president , while privately holding his viewers in utter contempt			1
@entity24 looms physically large , and his menacing grin springs from the screen ; this is , at its core , a horror movie , and @entity24 plays it as such from the first frame in which we see him			2
the movie did only tepid business upon its release , and -- in retrospect , this is astonishing -- was not nominated for a single @entity157			0
the next year @entity24 starred in the amiable military comedy " @entity159 , " and by 1960 " the @entity32 " was on network television and he was on his way to sweet , gentle fame , under blue skies and white clouds			2
as @entity44 says goodbye to him , and to his worthy acting career , i hope -- especially if you have never seen it -- that you 'll take the time to watch him in " @entity60 , " filmed before his own face had become universally recognizable			2
you 'll not only be honoring his life			0
you will be doing something that none of us , when given the opportunity , should ever pass up : witnessing greatness			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity24 .			0

@entity178 : when @entity24 died , most recalled him as the aw - shucks *sherriff* @entity30
but a stunning *performance* he gave earlier in his first film was the *antithesis* of his tv role
in " @entity60 " @entity24 played a drifter - turned - star , an oily , monstrous character
@entity178 : @entity24 owns the movie ; you should see it to understand how good @entity24 was
