-- just one day after the @entity2 announced that airline travelers would soon be able to keep their personal electronic devices on throughout their flights , two airlines made changes			1
on friday , a @entity9 flight from @entity10 to @entity11 became the first commercial flight to allow " gate - to-gate " use of such devices , the airline said			1
@entity15 also announced that it modified its rules regarding electronic devices as soon as it could			1
until now , passengers in the @entity19 were prohibited from using the devices until their plane rose above 10,000 feet			0
a ban on using cell phones for voice communication remains in effect			0
the @entity2 announcement came thursday , and that same day , @entity9 asked to be allowed to implement the new rules			1
the @entity2 gave its approval friday , and the airline implemented the rules immediately			2
@entity15 confirmed through its @entity31 account that the @entity2 approved its plans , too			2
the @entity2 refused to say which airlines had applied for permission and which were granted permission , saying the agency prefers that the airlines release that information			0
when it announced the changes , the @entity2 predicted that airlines would apply the new rules by the end of the year			1
the @entity2 , following months of study by a group of aviation experts , said that airlines can allow passengers to use portable electronic devices such as tablets , laptop computers , e-readers and cell phones in airplane mode throughout the flight , with some circumstantial restrictions			2
the @entity2 had long said that using electronic devices during takeoff and landing posed a safety issue and that radio signals from the devices could interfere with an aircraft 's communications , navigation and other systems			0
but a panel the @entity2 established last year to study the issue concluded that most commercial airplanes can tolerate radio interference signals			0
@entity0 's @entity68 and @entity69 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity2 this week announced that airlines can allow *expanded* electronics use
@entity9 and @entity15 say they are the first to move on the new rules
flights from that airline now allow devices to be on throughout the flight
