the @entity0 on wednesday approved president @entity2 's request to arm and train @entity4 rebels in the fight against @entity6			1
with significant opposition to the proposal in both parties , the vote was 273 -156			1
more than one third of the @entity0 -- 71 republicans and 85 @entity13 -- voted no. many @entity12 argue the strategy is n't tough enough to defeat @entity6 ; many @entity13 worry the plan could drag the @entity16 into another long military engagement			1
the proposal would authorize the @entity19 to provide assistance to " appropriately vetted " members of the @entity4 opposition and require the administration to give @entity24 a detailed plan for helping the rebels before that assistance could begin			1
the @entity28 will vote thursday on the proposal			1
@entity29 : @entity16 ground troops to fight @entity6 , if necessary @entity0 @entity12 leaders scheduled an extended debate that stretched over two days			2
most measures are only discussed for one hour with only a handful of people participating			0
but since so many @entity0 members were elected after @entity24 weighed in on @entity37 , close to 100 @entity13 and @entity12 came to the @entity0 floor to explain what amounted to their first vote on an international conflict			1
it was a debate that highlighted unusual alliances			0
conservative @entity12 who want more aggressive military action joined progressive anti-war @entity13 worried about another @entity16 intervention and opposed the measure			0
but backing the plan were hawkish @entity12 members and @entity13 who argued the proposal to send @entity4 groups into the fight against @entity6 would send a message to international partners to join the effort			1
the vote came as an amendment to a spending bill to keep the government funded through mid-december			0
it was a vote to grant the new authority to president @entity2 , but did n't include any new money			0
the administration has adequate resources for its current airstrike campaign and the program to assist the rebels in an existing fund covering overseas operations			0
the measure would let the @entity19 transfer money from that account as needed			0
notably , some war veterans on both sides of the aisle argued forcefully against giving the new authority to the president			1
@entity13 rep. @entity78 of @entity79 , who fought in @entity37 , said the goals of the president 's plans to arm @entity4 were " unrealistic " and pointing to @entity37 and @entity83 , said sharply , " clearly our leaders have not learned their lessons			1
" @entity87 @entity12 rep. @entity86 , who fought as a @entity88 in both @entity37 and @entity89 , said that while he did support arming @entity4 rebels last year , the sectarian violence has worsened and now he has " no confidence we are arming the right people			2
" but another veteran , rep. @entity96 , @entity96 , who flew missions over @entity37 , warned that not giving this authority would send a worrisome signal to @entity16 allies in the region that are battling the terror group			0
others argued this was a time to unite behind the president to show the international community that the @entity16 was moving against terrorism			0
the third - ranking @entity0 @entity12 , rep. @entity108 , warned " the threat of @entity6 is real and growing and it 's not just limited to the @entity110			2
" the @entity112 congressman said while @entity24 was giving this authority to the administration , " there 's got to be a give and take , " and said the provisions added by the @entity12 would give the legislative body oversight over the new operation with the @entity4 moderates			2
@entity24 is expected to debate a broader war authorization after the midterm elections .			0
