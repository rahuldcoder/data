-- everything is on fire in " @entity3			1
" @entity7 , as the mighty @entity4 ( otherwise known as the dude who slayed the @entity6 ) , takes on a two - headed griffin - like creature that trashes a village with its incendiary breath			1
the spears and tridents that various warriors keep clutching glow in their fists like molten iron			2
and the film 's most deluxe monster is @entity20 ( father of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 ) , who , after being overthrown and imprisoned , has now risen up in the form of a really , really gigantic giant made entirely of volcanic rock and ash , with humungous arms that disintegrate and reconstitute themselves as they throw off fiery streams of lava			0
for a movie that 's basically all warmed - over pseudo-mythology and special effects , " @entity3 " is certainly more fun , in its solemnly junky way , than " @entity38			1
" it may also be a little more fun than its cheeseball predecessor , the 2010 remake of " @entity42			0
" a lot of the digital effects are quite good , though that prompts me to ask : why do the camerawork and editing have to be so jittery ? in the old days , movies used to invite us to sit back and gaze at monsters , to really drink them in			1
the beasts did n't need to be photographed as if we were watching " @entity6			0
" the other limitation of " @entity3 " is that the dialogue is mostly made of wet cardboard			2
what there is of it consists of actors like @entity61 , @entity62 , and @entity63 ­ rez ( as the evil @entity64 ) staring at each other and saying '' you 're my brother and you betrayed me ! '' or '' you 're my son and you betrayed me ! '' we get it : the gods are losing their power , there 's a whole lot of betrayal going on , and this means , somehow , that the world is about to end			2
it 's up to @entity4 to amass an army to fight @entity20 and the forces of chaos			2
maybe it 's just my imagination , but @entity7 seems to be getting slightly less stiff as an actor			1
he now smiles occasionally , and he 's at least risen to the soulful inexpressiveness of the young @entity85			0
for a movie like " @entity3 , " which is basically " gladiator " crossed with " @entity88 " crossed with a special - effects demo reel ( call it " lord of the @entity92 " ) , he 's the perfect actor			1
and that 's because he never threatens to overshadow all that fire			0
