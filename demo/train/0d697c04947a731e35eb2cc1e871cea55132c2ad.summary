-- the @entity2 sank a @entity4 fishing trawler off the coast of @entity6 on thursday , more than a year after it was swept away by a tsunami off the east coast of @entity4 , authorities said			1
the trawler capsized hours after the @entity2 set fire to it , causing it to begin taking on water , said @entity14 @entity13 , a @entity13 spokesman			1
the sinking of the @entity16 brought about the end of a journey for the rust - stained ship that drifted across the @entity21 as part of a giant debris field generated by a tsunami that struck @entity4 following a 9.0 earthquake on march 11 , 2011			1
the @entity2 determined the trawler posed a threat to other ships navigating the area , and had been broadcasting the unmanned , unlit vessel 's location to mariners to alert them to the hazard			2
the @entity33 advised the @entity2 where the ship 's sinking would have the least environmental impact			0
" the potential for a pollution incident is unknown at this time , but officials have limited concerns about any biological threats due to the length of time the vessel has been at sea , " the @entity2 said in a statement			0
the @entity2 opened fire on the @entity16 at 1 p.m. thursday			0
the ship drifted from @entity49 waters into @entity51 waters on saturday , and was located about 180 miles west of the @entity52 in @entity6 , the @entity2 said			1
