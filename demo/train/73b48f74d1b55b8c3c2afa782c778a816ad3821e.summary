@entity0 -- @entity2 , including its capital @entity0 , teetered on the edge early thursday as clashes persisted following the bloodiest day since the revolution two years ago that was envisioned to bring peace and democracy to @entity2 -- but has not			1
the violence wednesday pitted @entity2 's military and current government against backers of deposed president @entity13 , though others also were caught in the fray			1
at least 278 people were killed , including 235 civilians , state tv reported , citing an @entity2 emergency official			1
interim interior minister gen. @entity20 said that an additional 43 police officers died			1
" it 's an open war , " said a protester who escaped one of two @entity0 camps that were raided			0
the intensity and violence lingered into thursday morning , when state tv reported @entity13 backers were attacking police stations , hospitals and government buildings despite a government - mandated curfew			1
more @entity2 troops were being deployed at entrances to @entity0 and @entity37 , with the unrest prompting the closure thursday of banks and the nation 's stock market			1
the 2011 revolution that led to the ouster of @entity45 , who 'd kept a firm grip on power for 30 years , was followed by @entity2 's first democratic elections			0
@entity13 -- a leader of the @entity50 group the @entity49 -- won the presidency in that 2012 vote , but was forced out by the military last month			1
@entity13 has n't been seen since he was taken into custody			1
yet his supporters have very public in voicing their opinions , massing on the streets of @entity0 and elsewhere to slam military leaders and demand @entity13 's return to the presidency			1
@entity2 's new government refused to back down , criticizing elements of the protest movement and specifically ordering them to leave two spots where they 'd been gathering in @entity0 for six weeks , or else they 'd force them out			1
on wednesday , they did			1
@entity69 ' war zone ' as security forces clear @entity0 square the story of what exactly transpired -- who attacked whom , who opened fire , who was to blame -- varied 180 degrees depending on where one stood in the debate over @entity2 's past , present and future			0
on the one side , there were @entity13 supporters , one of whom accused government forces of waging a " full - on assault " on what they said had been , to - date , peaceful demonstrations			1
on the other , there were those like @entity20 , who professed to being " surprised " by the " @entity49 's ( decision ) to attack the security forces			1
" what could n't be mistaken was the chaos , the bloodshed and the sense -- even with prime minister @entity100 's pledge " we hopefully will rebuild our nation " -- that the already volatile situation in @entity2 could be getting worse			2
" i think what we 're seeing right now is just the beginning of what is promising to be a very , very long and bloody battle as the interim government and the security forces try to regain control of the streets , " @entity1 's @entity104 reported from @entity0			2
diplomats condemn violence , calling it ' deplorable ' the government on wednesday , according to state tv , issued a month - long state of emergency			1
this a loaded term in @entity2 , given that @entity45 long ruled under such a decree that barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and let police jail people indefinitely			2
the prime minister said the government felt compelled to act to ensure stability , praising security forces for their " calm " and claiming some activists had intent to undermine the government			2
" we are here to build a democracy based on justice , " @entity100 said			0
" ... we have to reason and use common sense			0
we are all part of this nation			0
" yet not everyone expressed faith in his government			2
@entity142 -- a secular leader who was one of @entity13 's biggest critics before joining the government that replaced him -- submitted his resignation wednesday as vice president of foreign affairs , saying he did n't agree with decisions being carried out by the ruling government and " can not be responsible for a single ( drop of ) blood			1
" his decision spurred scorn from some former allies , with youth groups and june 30th coalition members questioning his stepping down " at this critical and historic phase , " according to state - run @entity158			2
@entity159 , the executive director of @entity160 , sharply criticized " ongoing violence " by @entity49 supporters against @entity163 churches in the country			2
he also chastised the government 's crackdown on the @entity50 group			2
" did n't have to happen , " @entity159 tweeted			0
" mb had right to protest			0
no need for massive lethal force			0
" @entity171 urges @entity2 to show restraint , protect civilians the @entity175 's top diplomat , @entity174 , urged " security forces to exercise utmost restraint and ... the interim government to end the state of emergency as soon as possible , to allow the resumption of normal life			1
" in light of the ongoing violence , the @entity185 is considering canceling next month 's planned biennial military training exercise with @entity2 forces , an official in president @entity184 's administration said			2
pressing @entity2 's government " to respect basic human rights , " @entity185 secretary of state @entity190 said that wednesday 's " deplorable " events " run counter to @entity2 aspirations for peace , inclusion and genuine democracy			1
" " the path toward violence leads only to greater instability , economic disaster and suffering , " he said			2
' they 're prepared to die ' for weeks , the two makeshift @entity0 protest camps had become cities unto themselves -- with people sleeping in tents , vendors hawking everything from haircuts to masks , and children playing in inflatable castles and splashing in kiddie pools			2
at dawn on wednesday , they came under siege			2
security forces rushed in , bulldozing tents and escorting away hundreds			0
some mothers and fathers managed to whisk away their children , gas masks on their faces			0
within three hours , the smaller camp -- @entity225 , near @entity226 -- was clear , except for shreds of torn - down tents that remained			0
but the larger protest , near the @entity230 in eastern @entity0 , proved trickier			0
facing heavy resistance , the military called in special forces			0
along with smoke , bursts of rapid gunfire filled the air , as did people 's wails			0
many protesters refused to leave , even in the face of bulldozers and surrounded by the injured and dead			2
" they said they 're prepared to die , " @entity1 's @entity244 reported			2
@entity246 reported that snipers from the @entity49 -- @entity13 's party -- exchanged gunfire with @entity2 security forces near a university building			1
the dead included cameraman @entity253 , who 'd worked for @entity255 - based news channel @entity254 for 15 years and for @entity1 before that			0
@entity258 of @entity259 , who was in @entity2 on her own time having celebrated the @entity262 holiday , also died , editor - at - large @entity257 told @entity1			0
and @entity265 photojournalist @entity264 was shot and wounded , the news agency told @entity1			0
she was being treated in a hospital			0
' walking on the blood of the victims ' @entity20 , the interim interior minister , claimed armed protesters were the aggressors -- including trying to storm police stations , the @entity274 building and other targets in @entity0			1
the fighting was n't limited to the capital			0
@entity13 backers reportedly besieged churches in @entity281 , setting fire to @entity283 , a tour bus and a police car , @entity278 said			1
@entity286 , an @entity2 billionaire who helped found the @entity287 , said his party had video of @entity49 members " shooting machine guns on civilians , on police			1
so anyone who wants to call this a peaceful demonstration would be wrong			0
" but @entity297 , a @entity49 spokesman , told @entity1 that @entity286 was trying to misrepresent video of masked people with weapons			0
besides claiming they 'd been shot at , the @entity49 also accused police of throwing @entity303 cocktails at makeshift clinics			0
security forces pushed doctors out of one hospital at gunpoint , a witness said , and a @entity1 crew at one point was " literally walking on the blood of the victims			0
" yet @entity20 said government forces had done what they could to limit casualties , with his ministry insisting , " @entity2 security forces are committed to the utmost self - restraint in dealing with the protesters			1
" divisions rife , future uncertain in @entity2 rather than uniting @entity2 after @entity45 's fall , divisions remained rife -- and , in some ways , intensified -- during @entity13 's time as president			1
critics accused him of being authoritarian , trying to force the @entity49 's @entity330 agenda , not being inclusive and failing to deliver freedom and justice			0
' nail in coffin ' for @entity335 ? the military coup to dismiss him , they said , was necessary since @entity13 did n't fairly represent all @entity2			1
so , too , were the efforts to force his supporters off the streets			0
" we believe in human rights , " said @entity341 , a spokesman for the @entity287 speaking in favor of the military			0
" but at the same time , we can not accept the idea of having a state inside a state			0
" @entity13 's backers , meanwhile , accuse the military -- and the government it appointed -- of undermining the people 's will , as expressed at the polls			1
the deposed president was n't given a fair chance , they say , and his supporters have been unfairly targeted for expressing their opinion			0
talking wednesday on @entity1 , @entity357 of the @entity358 blamed " corrupt elements " in the @entity2 army for the bloodshed , calling their actions a " crime against humanity " and " state terrorism			1
" " all presidents make mistakes , but you do n't have the army to remove them , " @entity357 said of @entity13			1
" ... what are we telling to the rest of the @entity373 world , the @entity49 world -- that bullets are better than ballots ? " opinion : @entity13 holds key to @entity2 's future @entity1 's @entity380 reported from @entity0 ; @entity1 's @entity381 and @entity382 reported from @entity383 ; @entity1 's @entity384 , @entity385 , @entity386 , @entity387 , @entity388 and @entity389 contributed to this report .			1
