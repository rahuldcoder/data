@entity0 , @entity1 -- this is a story of two test drives , albeit two very different ones			1
recently i got behind the wheels of two highly anticipated new - model electric cars -- the first of what could be a new wave of electric vehicles in the @entity13			1
made available for my scrutiny as a typical driver were the all - electric @entity16 and the plug - in hybrid @entity17			1
i drove the @entity16 about five miles around the city streets of @entity0 ( with a brief highway detour ) and the @entity17 630 miles from @entity21 , @entity22 , to @entity23 , @entity24			1
it was 15 minutes in the @entity16 versus 10 hours in the volt			1
both driving experiences showed me that these cars are very much like piloting a " normal " vehicle -- with one difference -- it 's much easier to sneak up on people			1
electric range / gas mileage we drove the @entity16 at a @entity35 / @entity34 of @entity0 / @entity16 event near the @entity2 headquarters			1
the route was about 2 miles and we deviated another couple of miles by taking it exit - to - exit on the @entity41 ( luckily it was before our 180 - minute rush hour )			0
with such a short drive , neither we nor any of the other 20 drivers who came out to the test drive came close to wearing down the battery			1
when i took my turn behind the wheel , we had 73 miles of electric range left			0
when i exited the vehicle , there were 68 miles remaining			0
@entity16 says the car should go 100 miles on a full charge , but that depends on weather conditions and driving style			1
a few days later we hopped in the volt in @entity21			0
a team of @entity60 engineers and pr folks were traveling north to @entity23 for some public events			0
heading east on @entity63 , i had about 40 miles of electric range			0
as i accelerated i paid scant attention to the green ball on the digital display that tells you how economical you 're driving			0
with a half - day 's drive in front of me , i was n't interested in saving power , only time			1
about 38 miles east of @entity21 , driving about 70 mph , the batteries were down to the minimum			1
now , in a purely electric - powered car you 'd have to pull over and charge up			2
but the @entity17 has a gas - powered generator that comes on when the batteries are nearly depleted			1
it creates electricity to keep the batteries minimally charged to drive the car ( and at certain points it helps turn the wheels )			2
we traveled the remaining 600 miles on gas - powered electricity , and at speeds about 8 to 10 mph over the limit , we averaged about 37.1 mpg			2
related story : range - anxiety a concern for electric car buyers noise it 's nearly impossible to describe the absence of noise , but both cars are eerily silent			1
it 's like riding in a golf cart ; you turn it on but there 's no sound			0
even when you 're merging into traffic at 70 mph in the @entity16 ( hey , i was going with traffic ) , the vehicle makes very little noise			1
when i ran down the @entity17 battery , the gas engine kicked on without much fanfare			1
i was told it was about to happen and i still did n't really hear it start			0
i pretended to notice , but i was guessing			0
with the radio on , i doubt you 'd hear it at all			0
when we drove into @entity115 , @entity1 , for lunch , we took the car down an alley to park			2
a happy couple -- full of local food and sunshine -- sauntered aimlessly in front of us , oblivious to the fact that our car was creeping up three feet behind them			2
so i pulled the bright lights bar to activate the horn designed to let pedestrians know there 's a volt nearby			0
the pedestrian horn is quieter and more polite sounding than the regular volt horn , which is accessed from where you 'd expect it to be on the steering wheel			0
pickup electric cars can get up and go			2
both cars responded impressively to a foot mash on the pedal from a dead stop			2
i never got a chance to test the @entity16 's passing ability on the highway , but i sure did during the @entity17 journey			1
we encountered a few slower cars in the left lane			2
i drive an old @entity151 , with 210,000 miles accumulated in my own journeys to @entity24			0
based on my car 's performance , i guessed the amount of time my @entity151 needs to make a highway pass and applied it to the volt			2
most of the time , i 'd clear the car enough to pass -- but not with the same amount of room to spare			2
and a couple of times i had to slow down , fall back and get in line again			2
it just seemed to take a long time to go from 60 mph to 70 mph			1
comfort the @entity16 and the @entity17 are smaller cars and i 'm a semi-big man ( 6 - 1 , 240 )			1
both had comfortable front seats , but the leg room in the back was a little cramped , especially if the driver is my height or taller			0
my back did get a bit tight after three hours straight in the @entity17 's driver 's seat , but i switched on the heated seats			1
although my glutes got a bit toasty , it did help with my lower back			0
we drove about four hours at a time and each time i got out to stretch my legs , i was n't stiff or leg wobbly at all			0
my colleagues who came along on the @entity16 ride were a bit shorter than me , and they had no problems with legroom or headroom			1
styling these cars are n't going to get looks at stoplights , until people realize they are electric cars			2
that 's when you get the questions			0
but to me , they 're both nicer looking cars when you see them in person			1
the @entity16 was red -- and it drew raves from the test drivers			1
one said she thought even her teenage daughter would approve			0
we caught a few people on the highway snapping camera - phone pictures of the volt			0
( there were four volts in the caravan , so by the time you passed the third one , you had time to figure out what was going on )			0
many buyers will care more about how the cars are fueled than they will about the cars ' styling			1
but they also wo n't be caught driving a car as ugly as some of the previous electric vehicles on the market			2
overall both cars live up to their hype			2
the @entity16 is cute and peppy and has enough room for five people for a short trip			1
the extras -- like satellite navigation that can find charging stations and the ability to start the air conditioning or heater a few minutes before you get in the car -- are great			0
it will cost $ 32,780 before a federal credit of $ 7,500 and state credits of up to $ 5,000			0
details on electric car tax breaks a hundred miles should cover most commutes and errands , so the @entity16 would make a good second car , a car for a high school driver , or the in - town resident who has easy access to charging			1
the volt is a car for people who want to run on batteries during the workweek and be able to go on a weekend trip without renting another car			0
it 's a small car on the outside , but has the feel of an expensive car on the inside ( although at $ 41,000 before a federal tax credit , it is a bit pricey for most people )			0
@entity60 is throwing in bells -- like a free @entity266 driver assist package for five years -- and whistles -- like an automatic climate system that warms the front seats and passenger cabin to a comfortable temperature when it 's cold outside			0
second opinion : @entity276 's car critic drives the @entity17 these cars will be on the road soon , and you might not even notice , unless you happen to see them plugging into to an electrical source to charge their batteries			1
while they have much in common with their totally gas - powered brethren , that 's what makes these two electric cars significant , and possibly , game - changing .			0

**writer** test drives @entity16 in @entity0 and drives @entity17 up the @entity292
cars are zippy off the line , and super quiet even at 70 mph
they look better in person , **writer** says
most buyers will be interested in *environment* , but will also get good , fun car
