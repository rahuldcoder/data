-- from the moment the ancient @entity1 held the first @entity3 2,700 years ago , our picture perfect image of elite sportsmen has revolved around the oiled , ripped , macho body			1
but not all our leading sports stars fit the stereotypical bill of chest - thumping demigods			1
some , such as jockeys , instead go to extreme lengths to stunt their growth -- sometimes down to the size of a pre-pubescent child			1
in an industry where just a few extra pounds can rule you out of a multi-million dollar race , jockeys are put under enormous pressure to meet miniature weight requirements			1
in the @entity24 the minimum riding weight is 53kg -- around the average size of a 14 to 15 - year - old boy			1
and for the rider desperate to shed a crucial pound before a competition , one seemingly drastic option may be to purge themselves in a specially designed " heaving bowl "			2
it may sound shocking to those outside the racing industry			2
but the basins installed at @entity24 race tracks for vomiting , or " flipping " as it is known in the trade , is one of the more extreme dieting methods used by professional jockeys			1
the use of heaving bowls still remains largely taboo , with 2004 @entity47 documentary " jockey " causing a stir after it showed footage of the bowls at @entity52 race track -- home of the prestigious @entity54			1
retired jockey @entity55 says they are still a regular , if unspoken , sight at many @entity24 race tracks			1
" it 's a square , porcelain bowl with a big hole to flush down the vomit , " said @entity55 , now regional manager for @entity58 -- the riders ' welfare association			2
" they 're usually in their own cubicle at the end of a line of toilets			0
" riders would lose their teeth due to the constant acidic bile , some even to the point of needing dentures			1
however he added that some of the basins had been removed since he quit riding professionally six years ago			0
new race tracks also tend not to install them			1
the @entity79 and @entity58 did not have figures on how many heaving bowls were still in use			1
@entity55 never used the bowls himself , instead relying on strict dieting , saunas and diuretics , known as " water pills , " which help the body excrete fluid			2
" i would n't say heaving bowls are frowned upon within the trade , " he said , adding : " everyone has their own methods of losing weight , but rather than vomiting , i 'd say the number one way is still dehydration			1
it 's not uncommon for guys to lose three to four pounds a day in the hot box			0
" we 're just in the process now of educating jockeys on safe dieting and bringing up minimum weights -- the @entity24 is a lot behind @entity106 in that sense			1
" sweat suits , saunas , hot baths and starvation are still very much in use in the racing industry on both sides of the @entity115 , even if there is a growing movement to change it , says dr @entity118 , chief medical officer at the @entity119 , which regulates racing in @entity120			2
" the bad old days of extreme dieting methods have n't fully gone by any means , " he said			2
" @entity123 is still a very common practice in that the jockey may not eat for 24 hours or more before a race , and combine this with a sauna or hot bath			2
" among @entity136 jockeys , 14 % use vomiting as a method for meeting weight requirements , dr @entity118 and his team found in a 2011 study into dieting habits			1
another 71 % admitted to restricting their food intake , while 81 % exercise in sweat suits and 86 % use saunas			0
@entity144 , muscle depletion , decreased blood flow and even depression , were some of the consequences of such rapid weight loss methods , according to dr @entity118			0
@entity152 - @entity151 , medical adviser at the @entity153 ( @entity154 ) , which promotes the interest of riders in the @entity157 , said there was no evidence small amounts of weight loss -- such as two or three pounds -- was dangerous -- but larger amounts , such as over seven pounds , posed long - lasting health risks			1
she added that one of the biggest concerns was slower reaction times in dehydrated jockeys			0
a hungry , dizzy rider on a 450kg horse galloping at 40km , posed a danger to everyone on the track , she said			0
the @entity154 is now hoping to raise its minimum weight , currently the lowest in @entity106 alongside @entity174			0
at 49kg , it 's roughly the same size as an average 13 - year - old boy			0
while some jockeys still undertake dangerous crash dieting methods , things have vastly improved in the last ten years , with a new emphasis on education and support services in @entity157 , dr @entity178 said			2
@entity157 jockey @entity186 , who at 6ft is one of the tallest riders in the game , acknowledges it is a constant struggle sticking to strict diets			2
the 30 - year - old must keep his weight down to 57kg , following a regime of low - calorie meals , hot baths and exercise in sweat suits			0
for breakfast , @entity186 will usually have a bowl of cereal and a cup of tea			0
lunch consists solely of a piece of fruit and for dinner he will tuck into some steamed chicken and vegetables			0
" on a saturday night i might treat myself to a nice meal -- a starter and a main course , " he said			0
" mentally , it 's very important to have a break now and then			0
" so why do some jockeys still put themselves through such a punishing , potentially dangerous routine in the pursuit of getting to -- and staying at -- the pinnacle of their sport ? " some of them just love to ride , " says @entity55			1
" but for others it 's a livelihood and they 've got a family to support			0
by whatever means necessary , they 've got to keep putting food on the table			0
" whether the jockeys themselves will also enjoy that food is a different matter .			0

the stereotypical image of sportsmen is of bulging six - packs -- except jockeys
horse riders are put under enormous pressure to meet racing weights
drastic methods include vomiting in " heaving bowls , " found at @entity24 race tracks
teeth fall out due to constant vomiting , some to the point of needing dentures
