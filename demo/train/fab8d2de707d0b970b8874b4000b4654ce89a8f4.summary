officer with the @entity6 was of a large outbreak of measles , mostly among @entity10 children , many under a year old , and many who became infected when they visited hospital emergency departments for other reasons			1
i will never forget how nervous i was			0
i wanted to do a good job for those children , their families and everyone around them			0
these infants were too young to be vaccinated , and as a result they were particularly susceptible			0
so we vaccinated those around them to stop transmission			0
by 2000 , a decade after my @entity4 experience , measles transmission in the @entity26 was declared to have been stopped			1
however , we still have occasional clusters of measles in pockets of unvaccinated children after measles has been brought into the @entity26 from somewhere else in the world			1
usually there are about 60 cases of measles in the @entity26 in any given year			1
but this year we saw 175 reported cases in the first 11 months -- all ultimately linked to people who brought measles to the @entity26 from abroad			1
although most of us do n't realize it because it is so rare in our country , measles is a serious disease			2
@entity42 , on an average day , 430 children -- 18 every hour -- die from measles and its complications			2
measles is so contagious that if one person has it , 9 of 10 people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected			2
@entity49 : a nightmare health scenario we can stop today 's interconnected world means we 're all linked by the air we breathe , the water we drink , and the food we eat			0
global travel speeds the rate at which infectious disease threats such as measles can be delivered to our doorstep			2
some think infectious diseases are no longer a problem in the industrialized world			0
but the fact is that infectious diseases continue to be with us			2
that 's why prevention is the key			0
the threat from measles would be far greater in the @entity26 were it not for the development of the measles vaccine and its widespread use in childhood immunization programs around the world			1
this week we celebrate the 50th anniversary of its creation			0
since 2001 , a global partnership that includes @entity6 has vaccinated more than 1 billion children			0
over the past decade , these vaccinations have prevented more than 10 million deaths			0
the worldwide effort to prevent deaths from measles will leave behind an important global health infrastructure that will continue to make the world more secure			1
improvements overseas , such as strengthening surveillance and lab systems , training disease detectives , and building facilities to investigate disease outbreaks , make the world -- and the @entity26 -- safer and healthier			1
@entity97 is just a plane ride away			1
it can be brought here by @entity26 travelers and visitors from other countries			1
we must continue to be vigilant about measles transmission here at home			1
parents should protect their children by making sure they 've had two doses of measles vaccine			2
and all of us should make sure we 're up - to - date on vaccinations , particularly prior to overseas travel			0
these steps will protect the @entity26 from measles until the world becomes measles - free			1
@entity6 director : a disease outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere the opinions expressed are solely those of dr. @entity49 .			0

measles was declared *eradicated* in the @entity26 in 2000
we still continue to see cases stemming from overseas
@entity97 is preventable through vaccination
