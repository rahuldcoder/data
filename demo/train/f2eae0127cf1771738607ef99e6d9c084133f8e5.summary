-- for the fourth weekend in a row , @entity1 easily led the domestic box office , holding off three new wide releases from the top spot			1
@entity7 's $ 90 million blockbuster adaptation earned $ 21.5 million over the friday - to - sunday period , marking a slim 32 percent drop from last weekend			2
all told , @entity1 has earned $ 337.1 million after 24 days and seems headed for a final domestic total of about $ 375 million			2
the only other 2012 releases likely to reach those sorts of numbers are franchise films @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 : an @entity18			1
internationally , @entity1 is n't yet the franchise - launching blockbuster that it is @entity22 , but it is performing quite well week - to - week			0
the film is nearing the $ 200 million mark overseas , and as of sunday , its worldwide total stands at $ 531 million			1
that figure should only climb with each subsequent sequel			0
the @entity29 ' latest comedy , @entity30 , debuted in second place with an unexpectedly strong gross of $ 17.1 million			1
while that figure is n't gargantuan , the slapstick romp fared better with ticket buyers and critics than anyone expected , since ads for @entity30 , which highlighted the goofball physical comedy of the original 1930s film series , had many people thinking the film was a dud			1
@entity44 spent a reported $ 30 million on the comedy , which stars @entity46 , @entity47 , and @entity48 , and marketed it to comedy - craving men and young boys eager for a family option other than @entity53			0
this strategy proved effective : according to @entity56 , the film played to audiences that were 59 percent male			1
stooges earned a lackluster " b - " cinemascore grade , though — crowds under 25 gave the film an " a- " and crowds 25 and up gave it a " c " — which could hurt its box office longevity			1
still , this should prove to be a minor winner for @entity44			0
after three years on the shelf following @entity74 's demise , @entity69 's horror / comedy @entity71 finally got its release , and over its debut weekend , the film scared up $ 14.9 million — a respectable result			1
@entity7 faced a difficult challenge in marketing cabin without giving away the film 's plot , which is most effective when kept under wraps			1
encouragingly , the film , which @entity7 acquired for slightly less than $ 20 million , ticked up from $ 5.5 million on friday to $ 5.7 million on saturday — a rare increase for frontloaded horror films and fanboy flicks ( cabin is both of these things )			1
this may have been the effect of strong word - of - mouth and stellar critical reviews overall ( the film stands at 93 percent " fresh " on @entity96 ) , although audiences polled by @entity56 did n't prove overly enthusiastic			1
they gave the film a harsh " c " grade			2
increasingly , @entity56 grades do n't seem to line up with critical opinions — this recently happened with @entity103 , which critics loved , but audiences issued a " c - " grade			0
only time will tell whether word - of - mouth proves a boon or an anchor for @entity109 , but it has a shot at becoming a mid-level sleeper hit			0
in fourth place , @entity112 sank by only 33 percent to $ 11.6 million in its second weekend			1
after ten days , the @entity115 re-release has pulled in $ 44.4 million , passing the re-release total of @entity117 : episode i — @entity119 , which earned $ 43.3 million total despite a strong $ 22.5 million start			0
@entity112 should sail right past @entity122 's $ 47.5 million gross over the next few days , and finish around $ 65 million			1
while that 's lower than @entity126 's $ 94.2 million re-release total , and a bit less than many were expecting , @entity124 spent just $ 18 million to convert the picture , so the the re-release will prove profitable — especially as a launching pad for the @entity133 , set to hit stores soon			0
@entity135 rounded out the @entity136 with $ 10.7 million , a 50 percent decline from last weekend			0
@entity140 's sequel has grossed $ 39.9 million against a $ 50 million budget , but given steep drops like this one , @entity138 will end up the lowest - grossing title in the @entity145 franchise			0
down in ninth place , @entity148 / @entity147 thriller lockout started its run with a weak $ 6.3 million out of 2,308 theaters			2
the action film earned a " b - " cinemascore grade			2
in limited release , @entity155 's buzzy documentary @entity154 , which finally got a pg - 13 rating after cutting a few f - words , earned a moderate ( given the amount of press it has received ) $ 534,000 from 158 theaters			2
the film has earned $ 814,000 after three weekends			2
meanwhile , @entity164 , the @entity165 - funded adaptation of @entity167 's religious memoir , grossed an okay $ 281,000 from 136 locations			0
because @entity171 was funded by fans , the @entity170 - distributed feature has minimal negative costs			0
among milestones , journey 2 : the @entity176 crossed $ 100 million domestically this weekend			0
the film , which stars @entity178 , has earned over $ 315 million worldwide			2
@entity181 thriller @entity179 passed $ 125 million			0
and @entity182 reached $ 120 million , and is now set to pass the vow as @entity185 's highest earner in 2012			0
