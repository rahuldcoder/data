@entity0 -- a controversial -- and potentially pivotal -- call in a one - game playoff friday night between the @entity4 and @entity5 prompted a vehement argument by the @entity4 ' manager and fans to toss debris onto the field			1
the incident occurred in the eighth inning of the newly introduced wild card baseball postseason game , in which the two teams battled for the right to advance to a @entity17 division series			1
at the time , @entity5 led @entity18 by a 6 - 3 score			1
with one out and runners on first and second base , @entity4 shortstop @entity20 skied a pop - up to shallow left field			1
amid apparent confusion between two @entity5 ' players , the ball dropped -- which could have led to the @entity4 loading the bases			1
but instead , an umpire ruled @entity20 out , citing the infield fly rule			0
the rule is traditionally invoked on pop flies in the infield , in order to prevent fielders from letting a ball drop -- in order to get two outs instead of one , had they caught the ball			0
@entity41 : what is the infield fly rule ? @entity18 manager @entity44 stormed out of the dugout to protest the call , while angry fans pelted the field with cups , bottles and other debris			1
after an 18 - minute delay , play finally resumed -- with the umpires ruling the call still valid , and the @entity4 then playing the game under protest			1
@entity4 ' pinch - hitter @entity58 then walked before the @entity5 ' @entity60 struck out @entity61 to end the inning			1
after two quick outs in the ninth inning , @entity0 's @entity65 -- the team 's legendary third baseman who has announced this is his last season -- got on base with an infield hit			2
@entity71 then rocketed a ground rule double , bringing the tying run to the plate in the form of @entity76			0
yet the second baseman ended the game -- and the @entity4 ' season and , with it , @entity65 ' career -- by grounding out to second base			2
@entity82 , a 19 - year - old lifelong @entity4 fan who had driven all the way from @entity84 , @entity85 , for the game , was among those fans who felt cheated by the call			1
" i feel like i did n't see the game that i was supposed to see , " he said			0
@entity18 fans responded to the final out with more boos , as well as a smattering of more debris flying onto the field			1
the disgust was interrupted only by a chant of " @entity65 , " recognizing the end of the fan favorite @entity65 ' career			0
@entity65 ' last hurrah @entity99 , a former player and manager who is now executive vice president of baseball operations for @entity101 , told reporters later that he talked with umpire crew chief @entity103 during the long delay			1
after the game concluded , @entity99 talked to @entity44 and @entity4 general manager @entity106 about their protest			1
during the regular season , teams have 24 hours to file a written protest , after which baseball executives can make a judgment			0
but @entity99 said that timetable " just did n't make sense " with the game 's victors advancing to the next round of the playoffs starting sunday , so he decided the matter immediately			2
" i spoke to them and asked them what ( grounds ) they were making the protest on , " @entity99 said			0
" and i ruled , basically , to disallow the protest based on the fact that it 's an umpire 's judgment call			1
" when asked after the game if he doubted whether he made the right call after the boos and debris started raining down , umpire @entity130 said succinctly , " absolutely not			2
" with the 6 - 3 victory , @entity5 advances to play the @entity138 champion @entity136 in the next round of the playoffs			1
the @entity140 face off against the @entity141 in the league 's other postseason series			0
@entity144 's final day brings drama following the game , @entity44 criticized what he deemed " a bad call , " saying the ball was too far out in the outfield to warrant the infield fly rule			2
still , he said he was " a little disappointed " with fans who threw objects on the field and pointed out how the @entity4 ' three errors and inability to drive in more runs also contributed to the loss			2
" anybody can have one bad game , anybody can have one bad call go against you , " the @entity18 manager said			1
" it hurts losing ballgames like we did tonight			0
" @entity99 acknowledged some may understandably disagree with the eighth - inning call			2
yet he pointed out that mistakes -- including errors by fielders and strikeouts by hitters -- have been part of baseball for as long as the sport has been around			0
" i think controversy is part of what we do , because the game is not perfect , " @entity99 said			0
" that 's always been the game			0
" the @entity184 one - game playoff match between the @entity185 and the @entity186 did not have the controversy or trash throwing			0
@entity185 won the game 5 - 1 , continuing the miracle season the team is having			0
the @entity185 will move on to play the @entity191 on sunday			0
one - handed kid meets @entity65 @entity1 's @entity193 contributed to this report .			0

new : a baseball executive disallows the @entity4 ' protest of the game , so the result stands
an umpire makes a controversial call against the @entity4 in the eighth inning
@entity18 's manager protests and fan throw debris onto the field
the @entity5 end up beating the @entity4 6 - 3 to advance in baseball 's playoffs
