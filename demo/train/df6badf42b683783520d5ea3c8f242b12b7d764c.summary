-- familiar terrorist groups , familiar threats , familiar boasts and grievances -- all in new messages tied , either directly or indirectly , to @entity5			1
two videos and one audio link have come to light in recent days that suggest that the world 's most recognizable terrorist group is still active , at least in online postings			0
the audio is a question - and - answer session purportedly involving @entity5 leader @entity15 that was published friday on the radical @entity17 website @entity18			1
while @entity0 has not verified the authenticity of the tape , the voice is similar to @entity15 's from previously authenticated recordings			1
in a wide - ranging , nearly hour - long interview with @entity5 's media arm , known as @entity25 , @entity15 touches on everything from drones to @entity28 to @entity29			1
he insists that @entity5 is holding strong 13 years after the @entity31 launched its " war on terror " following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" the upper hand is for the one who does not withdraw from his land , " @entity15 says			2
" who has withdrawn from @entity38 , and who has not ? who has withdrawn from @entity41 and who has not ? " @entity15 adds that even @entity31 president @entity43 knows @entity5 " is expanding			1
" " @entity5 is scattered in all the @entity45 world and among the oppressed , " he said			2
that analysis is relatively peaceful compared with the chilling words uttered in a newly discovered video from @entity49			1
among its threats : " we will blow you up , until we finish you off			0
" members of the @entity56 - based , @entity5 - linked militant group also use the video to reflect on one of its most memorable , deadliest attacks to date -- the four - day siege last september of an upscale @entity62 , @entity63 , indoor shopping center that ended with at least 67 killed			1
that @entity66 attack may have been one of the bloodiest tied to @entity49 , but it wo n't be the last , men featured on the video suggested			1
" it 's not that @entity70 was enough , " they say			0
" there are still hundreds of men who are wishing for such an operation			0
" @entity75 , an authority on terrorism who interviewed the @entity79 and is a @entity0 national security analyst , said that this @entity49 threat has to be taken seriously			2
" we certainly ca n't dismiss their ability to carry out those kinds of terrorist attacks , " @entity75 said			0
the two messages come on the heels of another one that got attention this week showing what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of @entity5 in years			2
in the middle of that video clip , the man known as @entity5 's crown prince , @entity95 , appears brazenly out in the open , greeting followers in @entity99			1
@entity100 is the no. 2 leader of @entity5 globally and the head of @entity102 , or @entity102 , which is considered the most dangerous @entity5 affiliate			2
in a speech to the group , @entity95 makes it clear that he 's going after the @entity31 , saying " we must eliminate the cross			0
... the bearer of the cross is @entity31 ! " the video started appearing on jihadist websites recently , drawing the attention of @entity31 officials and global terrorism experts			0
@entity31 officials say they believe it 's authentic			0
they believe the highly produced video is recent			0
with some fighters ' faces blurred , there is worry it signals a new round of plotting .			0

he says that even president @entity43 knows @entity5 " is expanding "
