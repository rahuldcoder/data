-- it would be easy to look at the current conflict , @entity4 's militant fighters and smaller militias firing rockets in to @entity7 and @entity7 's crushing bomb and missile barrages , as a repeat of the 2008/2009 confrontation that killed more than 1,300 men , women and children			1
@entity4 is in a whole new place now			2
still trapped in the crowded confines of @entity20 's close packed neighborhoods where they were elected six years ago , only now with more friends outside			0
what has changed came in the wake of the @entity25 that swept away some of @entity7 's old regional allies replacing them with leaders more sympathetic to @entity4			1
@entity7 and @entity4 : how the conflict reignited gone is @entity32 leader @entity31 whom @entity7 could and did rely on to blockade @entity20 and squeeze @entity4 in 2008/2009			1
gone is the @entity32 state repression of freedom of speech that helped keep in check popular @entity38 passion			0
instead -- almost unthinkable four years ago -- @entity4 's political leader holds a live news conference in @entity41 , as @entity7 shells strike @entity44 broadcasters in @entity20			1
if proof of @entity32 's new role was needed , this was it			0
@entity32 did n't just send prime minister @entity48 to @entity20 friday with expressions of support for @entity51 , but handed @entity4 the bullhorn for propaganda when it needed it most			0
it is a remarkable turnaround			0
@entity55 , @entity4 's political leader , reveled in the spotlight , as he described a new , much more @entity4 - friendly @entity32			1
@entity57 : what is @entity4 ? but @entity32 is far from alone in the regional revolution that begins to isolate @entity7			1
the tiny @entity61 state of @entity62 has proven perhaps the influential political player , helping shape the region the way it wants			1
it has been seen to favor governments like that in @entity32 with roots closely tied to the moderate @entity72 of which the @entity44 @entity4 is a radical off - shoot , but long aligned with @entity74			2
last month when the emir of @entity62 made an historic visit to @entity20 promising $ 400 million of aid , it appeared he was trying to pull @entity4 away from @entity74 and closer to @entity62			1
@entity62 has been laying the groundwork for this for some time			0
when @entity4 leader @entity55 fled exile from the spiraling civil war in @entity82 earlier this year it was the @entity62 whose offer of safe sanctuary he accepted			1
the @entity62 have leverage in a way they never did in the past			0
so where does this leave @entity7 ? simply put , while @entity7 is stronger militarily , it is in a weaker political position than it was in 2009			1
why @entity7 might hesitate to start a ground invasion @entity32 is not going to help blockade @entity20 by constricting the @entity96 border crossing , or by offering the same level of intelligence cooperation to @entity7 that they have in the past			0
indeed , by some estimates @entity32 's security services no longer have the same control over @entity72 militants as they once did			0
many have been released from jail and are quietly regrouping in the capital 's sprawling suburbs or the sparsely populated and almost lawless @entity110 desert bordering @entity7			2
if the @entity7 government had hoped to count on some shreds of @entity31 - era support , it will be disappointed			0
today 's @entity32 rhetoric , while falling short of abrogating the peace treaty with @entity7 , has very much taken a @entity118 line			2
the long universal of the @entity121 world is a dislike of the @entity7 state 's treatment of @entity44			2
in the past most @entity121 leaders were dictators , able to take a path far different from the views of the @entity121 street			0
the region 's new @entity130 democratically - elected leaders are only too aware of the radical hardliners waiting for an opportunity			1
smuggling weapons to @entity20 -- the long way			0

some of @entity7 's old regional allies replaced with leaders more sympathetic to @entity4
@entity140 : @entity62 has proven to be influential political player in region
while @entity7 is stronger militarily , it is weaker politically than it was in 2009 , he says
@entity148 democratic leaders aware of radical hardliners awaiting opportunity
