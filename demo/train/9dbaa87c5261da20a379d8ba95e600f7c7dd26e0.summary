for many , this one test -- which lasts a good eight hours -- will determine which university they enter			0
it is considered the chance to make or break one 's future			2
in a country where more than 80 % of high school students move on to higher - level education , getting into a prestigious school is all the more competitive			1
the final year leading up to the test is one of most intense periods students will ever experience			1
" in @entity3 , the reality is most students have lived for this very day			1

more than 200 students committed suicide in 2009 and about 150 the following year , according to @entity92 's @entity127			1
a heavy reliance on rote learning is also a challenge the country faces , as it tries to diversify its curriculum and reduce the stress from studying			0
" it is a problem too that students learn a lot			0
they have a bunch of knowledge			0
they are well - equipped with good knowledge , i would say , but the process is so painful , they do n't know how to enjoy learning from learning , you know , " @entity92 said			0
the college entrance environment is better than it used to be in many ways			0
some fortunate students will win a ticket to university without taking the @entity13 through other recommendation programs			0
however , the importance of the @entity13 still outweighs alternatives			0
