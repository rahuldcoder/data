-- the @entity1 is ... strong			0
in @entity3 , that is			0
and most of @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
they all place in the top 20 of @entity12			1
but motherhood in @entity14 is a very tough proposition			0
the region has all 10 of the most difficult places for mothers in this year 's ranking , with conflict - plagued @entity20 last on the list			1
among the bottom 20 , only @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 are in other regions of the world			2
and the @entity27 ? we come in 30th on the @entity12			1
we may be 10th in per capita income and the number of years a mom can expect her child to attend school			0
but the good news ends there			0
we are just above @entity36 and @entity37 overall , but below @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
this year 's report on the @entity1 shows that we need to do better by moms in many parts of the world , including right here at home			1
two factors holding the @entity27 back are indicators we 've found to best represent the health and well - being of mothers and children -- their chances for survival			1
when it comes to a woman 's lifetime risk of dying in pregnancy or childbirth , we do better than only five other developed countries : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity27 women are 10 times more likely to die eventually from pregnancy - related causes than women in @entity70 , @entity71 or @entity9			1
opinion : men , step up on family planning our child mortality rate , meanwhile , is on par with those in @entity78 and @entity79			2
moms here are also three times as likely to lose a child by age 5 as moms in @entity86			2
after 14 years of assessing the state of the world 's mothers , @entity12 finds child mortality an indicator not only of children 's health and nutrition , but of the quality of care that mothers receive before , during and after pregnancy			1
this year 's report delved deeper into the dangers posed to children on what turns out to be the riskiest day of life -- the first			2
in the @entity27 , 11,300 babies a year die on the day they are born			2
that 's more than in the rest of the industrialized world combined			2
what can be done to save babies here is not as clear as in many parts of the world			0
globally , more than 1 million babies die the day they are born			0
but we also know that up to 75 percent of the 3 million newborns who die in the first month of life could be saved if trained health workers -- not necessarily doctors -- could deliver very basic interventions			0
an antiseptic costing 25 cents could prevent deadly infections starting in the umbilical cord			0
basic resuscitation devices costing $ 6 and less could save 229,000 babies a year			0
" @entity131 " could save nearly a half - million premature babies through the warmth of their own mothers ' skin , no incubators necessary			0
opinion : on @entity133 , let 's talk diapers but in the @entity27 , every baby can easily have access to far more sophisticated care at birth			1
so why are babies still dying and what can we do for them and their moms ? some of the reasons are congenital and difficult to address anywhere			2
another reason is our high rates of premature birth			0
one in eight babies is born too soon here			0
we ca n't fully explain this , although we know that the age of the mother and health issues like obesity play a role , as do high rates of elective cesarean sections			0
what we do know is that poor women are more likely to lose their babies , and that african - americans suffer the highest rates of loss			0
we need more research in this area and more action for @entity27 's poorest children in general			1
@entity12 is calling on @entity169 to create a @entity170 to address the critical issues facing the 22 percent of @entity27 children born into poverty			1
those issues include boosting their chances of surviving the very first day			0
@entity27 mothers deserve this action			1
there 's one other important indicator on our @entity179 : political status			2
countries that outperform their economic peers on maternal and child health tend to do very well on the political status of women			0
if we look back to 2000 , the year of our first @entity12 , @entity189 had a very high rate of female representation in government			2
since then it has made some of the greatest regional gains in helping its mothers and children survive			0
the @entity5 countries also have long had high proportions of women in parliament , and they have some of the world 's most supportive policies around motherhood , and some of the best outcomes for mothers and their children			1
it makes sense that when women are in political power , children in that country do better			1
they know firsthand what mothers and children need to succeed			0
today , women hold 19 percent of seats in the @entity169 -- the highest percentage in our nation 's history			1
but still , about half the countries in the world do better than that			0
the @entity27 remains the only developed country with no guarantee of paid maternity leave and is lagging behind on how much women earn compared with men			1
we need more women -- and men -- in leadership positions to focus on what will make a difference for @entity27 mothers and children to get our country out of 30th place			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

@entity244 : state of world 's mothers best in places like @entity5 , @entity9
she says @entity27 is 30th in @entity12 's annual index , below @entity39 , @entity38 , @entity41
factors causing rating : death in childbirth , infant mortality , lagging political power , she says
miles : @entity169 , create @entity170 to address poverty for moms , kids
