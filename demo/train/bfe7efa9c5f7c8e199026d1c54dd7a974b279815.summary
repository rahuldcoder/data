@entity0 , @entity1 -- there 's no better feeling when you 're showing off to your friends			1
sharing with them something you are proud and excited about			0
after giving journalists a tour pointing out features around the cabin of his new @entity15 , @entity10 chief executive @entity9 became excited			0
he said goodbye to me and hello to @entity19			0
@entity9 attentively showed him every nook and cranny of the aircraft , crouching down to recline the new business class seat that @entity19 was in , showing him the new touch screen control panels and glossy fold away trays			0
as we plugged in the microphone to ask @entity19 one question about what he thought of the plane , they headed to the front			0
after waiting for a few minutes , i crept forward to have a quick look what was going on			0
suddenly i heard " @entity40 ! ! " the ceo of @entity39 's head emerged from the cockpit			1
" wait , wait ! ! three ceos in the cockpit ? ! ! ! this never happens ! ! i said			1
there they were - @entity45 in the captain 's seat , @entity19 in the @entity49 's seat and @entity9 in the jump seat			1
" three ceos in the cockpit conspiring what to do in the aviation industry in the next 12 months " joked @entity9 , before i crawled in with a microphone			1
infographic : state of global aviation in numbers @entity10 has 60 @entity58 on order and will hopefully get five delivered this year , followed by @entity60 with an order of 41 and @entity62 with 24			0
@entity19 said that he was very envious of @entity9 receiving his 787s before him and how the aircraft 's fuel efficiency will help the industry in such a difficult economic climate , which was reflected by the subdued mood at this year 's @entity0			1
they were great sports for an impromptu interview			2
it felt like chatting to three guys who were old friends , having a laugh which was a rare informal side to see for men in their positions			2
i forgot i was talking to @entity41 - they were just three men in a cockpit .			2

@entity2 's @entity78 has been at the @entity0 this week
after finishing an interview she *sneaks* into the @entity83 787 cockpit to find some @entity84
@entity78 *recalls* *stumbling* upon a rare sight -- 3 ceos in a cockpit
