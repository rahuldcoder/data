@entity0 has begun in @entity1 , but for space enthusiasts , the most exciting glamor shots are coming from @entity4			1
the much - celebrated rover curiosity has so far strutted 109 meters ( 358 feet ) on the surface of the @entity4 , according to its odometer , and she 's looking great , @entity6 scientists say			1
the 2000 - pound suv - sized rover has been on the surface of @entity4 for about one month , and operating as expected			1
" there have been no significant anomalies or wild cards thrown in where the performance on @entity4 differed significantly from the @entity21 , " said @entity13 , @entity7 mission manager at @entity6 's @entity14 at a news briefing thursday			1
" that 's a real testament to the engineers that developed the system			0
" a new photo from the rover 's camera on the mast shows off the rover 's arm against the spectacular @entity4 landscape			1
on the arm is the @entity35 camera , with resolution so great that it can resolve down to the grain of talcum powder , said @entity39 at thursday 's @entity6 news briefing			2
@entity39 is the deputy principal investigator for @entity7 's @entity35 at the @entity41 , @entity42			0
all that separated this camera 's lens from the @entity4 environment was a dust cover , which appears to be intact			1
that means even higher - resolution images from the @entity4 may come through soon			1
" we 're just completely and totally enthralled and excited by this image , " @entity39 said			0
what we 've done on @entity4 , and what 's next another new photo shows the rover 's tracks from its first drives on @entity4 , as seen from the @entity59 camera on @entity6 's @entity60			1
scientists can get insights about how changes on the @entity4 surface , as dust is deposited , by examining these tracks over time			1
@entity59 also took an image of the parachute and back shell that helped @entity7 arrive safely			0
@entity7 made a dramatic landing on august 6 in a complicated maneuver involving a large parachute and a sky crane			1
scientists and fans watched the live @entity6 feed from the @entity14 as mission specialists confirmed the touchdown			0
the landing site has been dubbed @entity80 after science fiction author @entity81			0
premiering a song -- from @entity4 in the interim , researchers have been checking out the many different instruments on board curiosity			2
the rover also did a test drive in august and has moved away from the landing site			2
now , everything except for the arm and sampling system is already operational , scientists said			2
the rover is currently 82 meters ( 269 feet , measured as the crow flies ) from @entity80			0
it will remain there for about another week while scientists continue testing			0
in about a month , scientists plan to have @entity7 scoop up some @entity4 material			1
because the rover is taking images as it goes , planners can determine whether it 's making progress and how much slippage there is			0
it appears that there is very little slippage going on , @entity13 said			0
how driving a rover works : meet @entity112 @entity7 's next destination is @entity114 , a site with three types of terrain , including layered bedrock , that may be a prime target for drilling			0
ultimately , the rover will end up at @entity122 , about 3 miles high and composed of hundreds of layers of rock that built up over time			0
as the rover climbs , it will sample different layers to investigate signs that life could have once existed on @entity4			2
follow complete coverage of the @entity4 rover			2

scientists are *n't* seeing major ' wild cards ' in rover performance
dust cover on high - resolution camera appears to be intact
sampling of @entity4 material may begin in about a month
curiosity has been on @entity4 since august 6
