@entity1 if there were an annual prize for the " @entity5 , " it would likely go to @entity6			1
after years of disappointing returns , the world 's largest democracy rediscovered vigor in 2014			0
stocks rose by a third ; foreign investment grew by a quarter ; the economy at one stage expanded at its fastest pace in two years			1
beyond economics , the public mood seemed to lift : there was new hope for a young and tech - savvy @entity6 , unburdened by the failures of the past			1
one man dominated the headlines , peddling optimism : @entity6 's new prime minister @entity25			1
@entity25 has fashioned a role for himself not only as ceo of @entity28 but also as its global ambassador , with blockbuster speeches promoting @entity6 in @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
he is also @entity6 's brand manager , launching catchy campaigns such as " make in @entity6 , " " @entity36 " and " @entity37			1
" @entity25 has won a broad mandate , as evidenced by his party 's performance in tricky state elections in december			0
and yet , 2015 marks the end of @entity25 's honeymoon			0
after all , hope can only go so far			0
@entity25 's greatest accomplishment in 2014 was to offer promise : he energized weary @entity6			1
he convinced the world that @entity6 had a giant " open " sign on its front doorstep -- almost literally , with visas on arrival			1
he spent much of the year in campaign mode , in @entity6 and abroad			1
but in 2015 , @entity25 will need to transition from speechmaker to doer , or else risk disenchanting another generation			0
that suggests 2015 will be a defining year for @entity6			1
let 's start with economics			0
@entity6 was blessed with favorable tail winds last year			1
at the start of @entity25 's term , @entity61 crude was trading at about $ 110 a barrel			0
by year - end , prices had halved			0
cheaper oil was a boon to @entity6 's economy : the deficit shrank , inflation fell , and perhaps most crucially , the government took the opportunity to end decades of subsidies and deregulated diesel			1
new taxes on oil look set to generate billions of dollars in excess revenue every year			0
@entity6 's government will look to use that money well			1
can it deliver on its promises of clean water and power to 1.25 billion @entity6 ? can it really improve @entity6 's broken infrastructure -- ports , roads , trains and bridges , some of which never seem to connect ? can it begin to fulfill its promise to put a toilet in every home ? @entity92 has too much been promised ? in any case , @entity6 needs much more money and investment , likely from abroad			1
and @entity25 will need another important currency : cooperation from his lawmakers			0
@entity6 needs to rid itself of arcane laws on retrospective taxation			1
it will look to unite its states under a common tax system to foster free trade and business			0
but these acts will take political will and wile			0
can @entity25 legislate as well as he can campaign ? can he really , as his government has promised , improve @entity6 's ranking for doing business from a dismal 142nd in the world to somewhere in the top 50 ? these are all questions that @entity25 will need to answer in 2015			1
foreign policy has come easily to @entity25 so far			1
he will begin 2015 basking in the glow of receiving president @entity115 , the chief guest at @entity6 's @entity116 , on january 26			1
@entity115 will be the first sitting @entity118 president to visit @entity6 more than once			1
for @entity25 , however , good foreign policy means good business			1
he will look to strike deals not only with @entity115 , but with many other world leaders in 2015 -- on energy , trade , defense and infrastructure partnerships			0
all that sounds right up @entity25 's alley			0
the great unknown is how he will respond to a major foreign policy crisis , the likes of which he largely escaped in 2014			1
how will he react to a major skirmish with @entity133 ? how will he balance his desire to boost @entity136 trade with fears about @entity139 's growing assertiveness in the region ? and what will he do if , in a big global crisis , he is pushed to choose sides between any of @entity144 , @entity136 and the @entity118 ? can @entity6 remain everyone 's friend ? will @entity25 develop a values - based vision of @entity6 's place in the world ? on domestic issues , a year ago , @entity25 was known outside @entity6 mostly for his inability -- or worse , apathy -- in stopping one of the worst religious riots in modern @entity6 history , when some 2,000 @entity157 were killed in @entity158 , the state he ran at the time			1
@entity25 's perceived role led to his @entity118 visa being revoked			0
a year on , @entity31 received @entity25 as if he were a rock star			0
in the space of a year , @entity25 has managed to transform his image abroad from pariah to visionary leader			2
recent events are cause for renewed worry			0
reports of @entity171 groups forcing @entity172 and @entity157 to " convert " to @entity173 threaten the very basis of the @entity6 secular state			2
minorities simply can not live in fear			0
in 2015 , @entity25 will need not only to be a voice of reason , but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his @entity171 support base			0
the safety of women will remain a major issue of concern at home and abroad			2
at his 2014 @entity188 speech , @entity25 remarked how the @entity6 people 's heads " hang in shame " with each report of rape			2
the sad reality is that @entity25 will probably make the same comment at this year 's speech			0
as i 've written previously , @entity6 has let its women down for centuries : they rank 134th in the world for economic opportunities , 126th for education and 141st for health			2
how can that be good enough for a country that aspires to be a major world power ? beyond politics , from living and reporting in @entity6 , i am hopeful about this country 's future			2
my optimism is based less on politics or economics , and more on a larger trend : the country 's technology boom			0
while the @entity215 has evolved in its internet use -- from dial - up to cable to mobile 4g -- @entity6 's journey has been different			2
it has jumped straight to a mobile revolution			0
most @entity6 who discover the @entity223 will discover it on a cheap smartphone , not a pc			2
the pace of technology adoption , coupled with faster and cheaper hardware , will transform @entity6 in ways we are only just beginning to comprehend			2
so , expect @entity6 to start leapfrogging many of the problems the @entity215 has spent decades dealing with : @entity6 has never had a real database of its citizens , but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital biometric id system			2
there will be real changes in people 's lives and their economies with the help of e-commerce and apps for health , education , banking and transport			0
beyond oil , politics or demographics , the biggest tail wind for @entity6 lies in its adoption of technology			2
this will be @entity6 's real revolution , and it is already underway .			2

@entity260 : @entity6 needs much more money and investment , likely from abroad
the great unknown is how prime minister will respond to foreign policy crisis , he says
