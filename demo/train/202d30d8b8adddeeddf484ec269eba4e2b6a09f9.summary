@entity0 , @entity1 -- when coming face to face with the monstrous jaws of a great white shark , you 'd probably want to be armed with more than a wet towel			2
it seems almost insane to think placing a dark cloth over the formidable killer 's eyes will help calm it down for long enough to attach electronic tags , take blood samples , and even conduct an ultrasound			2
but in the space of just 15 minutes , a towel is one of the tools used to placate the fearsome creature while a team of researchers carry out important investigations into its mysterious living habits			1
this is @entity27 in action -- a group of gutsy scientists and sailors traveling the high seas on their 38 - meter floating laboratory , as part of a mission to tag and monitor an ancient animal we know surprisingly little about			1
watch more : @entity27 scientists tag great white " we do n't know much about the great white shark 's natural history , its ecology from day to day , how it lives and interacts with its environment , " said @entity39 , chief fisheries scientist on board @entity27			1
" but when you come onto this vessel and you have a live animal in front of you that you can study , it just opens new doors -- you can get a more robust assessment in a very short period of time			0
" ' you 're gon na need a bigger boat ' just a few kilometers from where @entity56 filmed his 1975 @entity59 blockbuster , " @entity60 , " the @entity27 team is also on the lookout for sharks			1
cruising along the @entity0 coastline in @entity1 , they lure the predators with mashed - up herrings , tuna , and a dummy in the shape of a seal			0
previously used to catch crabs , the converted @entity27 vessel features a hydraulic lift -- much like a giant cradle -- to lift the great whites out of the sea			1
it 's up to captain @entity78 to jump in the water and guide the sharks onto the platform , making sure to leave a good 10 meters between himself and the carnivores , which can grow up to six meters long			0
" as soon as we bring them on the platform the first thing i do is cover their eyes with a dark , wet towel and that usually calms them right down , " said @entity85			0
" then i will take two hoses with a lot of volume of water and make sure that it 's nice , clean seawater with bubbles in it that will cascade down each side of the gills			0
" pit stop science the scientists then have 15 minutes to bolt a satellite tracking tag to the fin , insert another acoustic tag in the abdomen , attach a third tag monitoring scale movements and tail beats , take blood and tissue samples , and even conduct an ultrasound			1
the whole operation has the appearance of an @entity118 racing car pit stop , with researchers crouched on either side and hurriedly attaching $ 10,000 - worth of high - tech equipment , expected to last around five years			1
since launching in 2007 , the team has tagged over 60 great whites , helping to build a global map of shark migration			1
scientists first started tagging the mysterious creature in the 1960s , often using a harpoon to attach a gps device			2
around 500 great whites have since been tagged around the world , revealing fascinating glimpses into their movements through the world 's oceans			1
one of the greatest distances ever recorded was that of a great white traveling from @entity139 to @entity140 in 99 days -- a distance of 11,100 kilometers			0
" what we have found is that male ( great white ) sharks are all living along the beach all the time -- they have very little off - shore life , " said @entity27 expedition leader @entity142 , whose team has researched great white movements off southern @entity139			1
" but the females go way out over @entity154 , and even out into the middle of the @entity156 , and they hang around out there for months and months			0
what are they doing out there ? are they gestating their babies ? are they feeding ? " time to act it 's exactly these questions that push the team to quite literally dive in the deep end with the terrifying -- and captivating -- animals			0
" shark populations worldwide are under threat -- sharks are being slaughtered at an unsustainable rate , many for a bowl of soup , " said @entity167			0
" this unsustainable harvest rate is driven by the demand for shark fins , meat and other products , and puts not only sharks at risk , but also the entire balance of the ocean			0
" @entity27 gives a name to each shark it tags -- from @entity184 , to @entity185 , and @entity186 -- in an effort to build people 's relationships with them and reflect their unique personalities			2
" @entity184 will travel 1,000 miles ( 1,609 kilometers ) a month -- she will visit @entity194 , she will travel down the southeast coast , she will go to places we do n't understand , " said @entity167 of one of the sharks			0
" this project is about solving the annual movements of the great white shark around the @entity201 -- it 's a 450 - million - year mystery and today everyone gets to watch it unfold in real time			2
