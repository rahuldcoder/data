-- search crews in @entity2 have suspended efforts to locate two tourists , still missing two and half days after the tourist boat they were traveling in sank			1
the head of the rescue mission says the search will resume on tuesday morning			2
officials say 23 other passengers and crew were rescued , pulled from the water by local fishermen and search and rescue teams			1
the survivors spent more than 36 hours in the water			2
the two people missing are believed to be @entity21 , other passengers on board said			1
however , officials at the @entity21 foreign ministry could not confirm this			2
the tourists -- mostly from @entity26 -- were on what was supposed to be an exotic getaway : a cruise from west to east , departing from @entity31 in the province of @entity33 and ending in @entity34 , in @entity35 , with a number of stops along the way			2
under normal conditions , the journey would have taken four nights to complete			0
everything appeared fine when the vessel , named @entity44 , set sail last thursday			0
three days into the trip , the boat ran into trouble			1
@entity49 , head of the rescue mission , who like many @entity52 goes by one name , says it 's believed the boat hit rocks off the volcanic island of @entity58 , at about 1 a.m. on saturday morning			1
@entity59 began leaking into the vessel , forcing the passengers and crew to abandon ship			1
the vessel was carrying 20 tourists and three local crew members and two local guides			1
@entity49 says authorities were first notified of the incident on sunday morning , and immediately deployed crews to the site			2
the nearest town is @entity73 on the island of @entity75 -- a two - hour boat ride away from where the boat sank			1
the passengers appear to have split into two groups			0
the first , consisting of 10 tourists , remained near the accident site			0
they were rescued on sunday afternoon			0
five were picked up by local fishermen , the others retrieved by search and rescue teams and taken to hospital in @entity73			0
after being rescued , one of the passengers identified as @entity90 , criticized the lack of equipment on the boat			1
" on the boat there was no security			0
no radio , no gps , no navigation equipment			0
there were nothing , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity2			1
" only life jacket , but life jacket it does n't work			0
if you 're in the middle of the ocean with a life jacket , what happens ? nothing			0
because the most important when you have an accident in the sea is to call the rescue team and to call the radio , gps or something			0
in the morning , the crew said ' no one is coming to rescue us			2
' " another 13 passengers and crew swam in the water using lifebuoys and life vests to stay afloat			1
they were retrieved by local fishermen on sunday evening , in the waters of @entity131 , a town in @entity35 province , and are currently being treated at a hospital there			0
@entity49 says it 's believed the two missing men who were with the second group became separated because of the strong winds and current .			1
