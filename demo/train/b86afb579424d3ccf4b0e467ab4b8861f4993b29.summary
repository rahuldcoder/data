@entity0 -- before tuesday night 's debate , polls showed @entity4 had gained ground with women voters			1
but his comments about using " whole binders full of women " as a hiring aid while governor , whiffing on an equal pay law question , and alluding to helping women get home to cook dinner has landed the @entity17 presidential hopeful in verbal quicksand with some female voters			1
he 'll have to do some serious repair to regain traction , political experts say			0
online erupts over ' binders full of women ' that 's because tuesday night 's debate made clear that both presidential campaigns are focusing on female voters â € ” a group that makes up the majority of the electorate			1
some of the spiciest exchanges between the candidates in their second debate were over so - called " women 's issues			1
" " @entity4 's discussion of his promotion of women in his gubernatorial administration was ... problematic , " said @entity38 , an associate professor of political science at @entity40 in @entity41			1
" @entity46 , @entity4 's description of how he found female appointees sounded an awful lot like affirmative action , and someone will bring this up again			2
accusations , interruptions define bruising debate also , the @entity56 exploded with links to articles about how @entity59 under @entity4 's leadership did n't have a female partner			1
" the highest - ranking woman in his gubernatorial administration was his no. 2 , lieutenant gov. @entity62			0
@entity64 has long held senior positions in @entity4 's political campaign			1
president @entity67 was quick to use the " binders " line against @entity4 on the campaign trail wednesday			1
" we do n't have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified , talented , driven young women ready to learn and teach in these fields right now , " @entity67 told supporters in @entity72 , @entity73			2
vice president @entity79 at a campaign event wednesday in @entity81 , @entity82 , questioned where @entity4 's comments were coming from			1

" ' @entity4 just ca n't connect with working women ' during the debate at @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity4 , who worked in business before serving as governor of @entity102 , said he " learned a great deal " about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state			2

but there is a lingering perception behind the comedic @entity165 takes on @entity4 's " binders full of women " response and pre-emptive advertising aimed at women that he is disconnected from the day - to - day issues facing that critical group of voters			1
and in a close election , that type of narrative could be a problem for @entity4 as he fights to woo a narrow pool of voters			0
5 things we learned from the debate " the gap between @entity67 and @entity4 was declining and i 'm not sure ... if the governor made significant headway ( with women voters ) , " said @entity182 , director of the @entity183 for the @entity184 at @entity97			2
a @entity191 / @entity190 poll conducted last week showed @entity4 had closed the gap with women and was within one point among women who are likely voters , 48 % for @entity4 and 49 % for @entity67			2
