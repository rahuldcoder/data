-- if you are a survivor of sexual abuse who has not yet reported , you may be attending closely to the trial of former @entity6 football coach @entity5 to see what happens to those who do			1
the news is both good and bad			1
you see some courageous men being taken seriously by prosecutors and journalists			0
but you see a degree of potential exposure that few victims would want to face , and that we could do a better job of preventing			2
first , the better news : we all know that sexual abuse is still a crime that is mostly unrevealed			1
but progress has been made			0
comparisons of recent surveys to those from the 1980s show far more victims today say they reported or that someone in authority found out			1
yet boys are still disproportionately less likely to report , for some of the reasons showcased in this trial : the fear that others will not believe they are really victims , and the fear that they will be stigmatized as wimpy and / or homosexual			1
so a case such as this with male victims coming forward , explaining how conflicted they felt , why it took them so long , what it did to their lives , but nonetheless giving convincing testimony that has clearly been believed by the prosecutors and much of the press , this certainly must give other boys and men some sense of possibility			2
indeed , that this case is being prosecuted at all shows how much has changed			0
people in law enforcement and the public at large now know that boys do indeed get abused			0
thousands of professionals have gotten specialized training in how to identify victims , how talk with them and how not to exacerbate the harm when interviewing			2
@entity64 exist in more than 600 communities to make the process more child friendly			1
these trained police and prosecutors do understand why it is so hard to report , why the testimony sometimes changes and how the fact of participating in the sexual activity does n't signify enjoyment or lack of harm			2
growing numbers of women in law enforcement have certainly helped			0
but we still have a long way to go			0
@entity5 trial : all you need to know about allegations , how case unraveled the possibility of your abuse ending up fodder for a national media frenzy that rivals the @entity90 would hardly seem comforting to most potential disclosers			1
the possibility of having your lifelong identity become " that kid who was molested by that coach " would be terrifying			0
in that light , perhaps the most discouraging news for survivors in the trial so far was the refusal of the judge to allow the victims to testify anonymously			1
this ruling would seem callous			0
lots of other countries have built in legal protections that prevent the media and other court participants from learning the names of child victims of sexual assault			1
even in the @entity113 we have protections against the disclosure of the names of juvenile offenders			0
the notion behind that is that young people can be permanently stigmatized by such notoriety			0
why not victims , too ? true , many news outlets have policies to avoid reporting the names of sexual assault victims			1
but it is an entirely voluntary policy , proudly flouted by some outlets			0
studies have shown that information that could readily identify victims appears in 37 % of news articles that report on child sexual victimization			1
so far , the names of the @entity5 accusers have not gotten widespread circulation			1
what was the judge 's rationale for denying what would seem like such a reasonable request ? " secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully , " judge @entity144 wrote in his order dismissing the request			2
" consequently , there must be justifications of public policy that are very deep and well - rooted to support any measure which interferes with the public 's ability to observe a trial and to make their own judgments about the legitimacy of their legal system and the fairness of its results			2
an enormous quantity of research shows sex crimes against children to be particularly traumatic , and aspects of the court experience to be a contributor to the trauma			0
allowing victims to testify anonymously would not truly undermine the openness crucial to make a judgment about the fairness of the system			1
the victims still have to testify publicly , still have to be confronted by the defense , still have their credibility tested in the eyes of the jury and the media			2
perhaps the judge was afraid of creating a basis for the appeal of a guilty verdict			0
but that only illustrates how the protection of victim identities needs to be better enshrined in law and practice so it is not seen as a risky anomaly			0
opinion : tell toddlers what 's private about their bodies however the rest of the trial goes , we we must continue to commit ourselves to building a justice system that takes into account the reasonable needs of child victims for privacy and protection			1
it is one of the biggest things we can do to help victims come forward and stop abusers after the first rather than the 10th victim			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity216 : abuse victims may be watching @entity5 trial to see how victims are treated
he says good and bad news . good : victims today far more likely than in past to tell someone
he says *teachers* , cops , communities far more clued in , *responsive* on child sex assault
@entity216 : bad news is judge would n't let victims testify anonymously ; this potentially *hurtful*
