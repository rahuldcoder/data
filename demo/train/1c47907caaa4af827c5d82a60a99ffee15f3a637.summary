@entity0 -- in a preview of a major constitutional showdown at the @entity6 over same - sex marriage , the @entity3 administration said on friday that a federal law denying financial benefits to legally wed gay and lesbian couples is unconstitutional			1
the @entity11 filed the first of a series of briefs in a pair of cases dealing with the multilayered issue , outlining the executive branch 's positions			1
the high court will hear oral arguments next month on the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes , marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman			1
that means federal tax , @entity30 , pension , and bankruptcy benefits , and family medical leave protections -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples			0
this case deals with @entity38 , forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay			0
because her decades - long partner was a woman , the federal government did not recognize the same - sex marriage in legal terms , even though their home state of @entity46 did			2
but now , led by president @entity3 's recent political about - face , the administration opposes the law			0
" moral opposition to homosexuality , though it may reflect deeply held personal views , is not a legitimate policy objective that can justify unequal treatment of gay and lesbian people " contained in the @entity23 law , solicitor general @entity49 said in the @entity11 's legal brief			1
the separate case from @entity61 deals with @entity62 , a 2008 voter - approved referendum banning same - sex marriage			1
this after the @entity61 high court had earlier concluded same - sex couples could legally wed. that case too will be heard in late march			1
though not a party in the @entity61 case , government sources say the @entity11 was prepared next week to file an " amicus " or supporting brief asserting a constitutional right to same - sex marriage , and that @entity62 should be struck down as a violation of constitutionally guaranteed " equal protection " of the laws			1
those sources say @entity3 was expected to make the final call on whether to intervene in the state dispute			0
" i have to make sure that i 'm not interjecting myself too much in this process , particularly when we 're not a party to the case , " @entity3 said wednesday in an interview with @entity1 affiliate @entity81 in @entity82			0
of more immediate concern was the @entity23 fight , where the administration is squarely involved			2
but a tricky gateway or " jurisdictional " question threatens to stall any final consideration of the law 's constitutionality			0
that was the focus of much of the friday legal papers			0
the @entity23 law will be defended by @entity98 , after @entity3 concluded the law was unconstitutional			1
traditionally , that role would fall to the solicitor general 's office			0
but @entity3 , in an election - year stunner , said last may that he supported same - sex marriage			0
the president had already ordered attorney general @entity106 not to defend @entity23 in court			1
that raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law			2
besides the constitutional issue , the justices had specifically ordered both sides to argue a supplemental question : whether congressional @entity116 -- operating officially as the @entity117 of the @entity119 @entity118 -- have " standing " or legal authority to make the case			1
lawyers representing the @entity118 @entity116 said friday that they should be able to take the lead and defend the law , since both @entity38 and the @entity3 administration are taking the same legal position			1
" without the @entity118 's participation , " said attorney @entity127 , representing @entity118 leaders , " it is hard to see how there is any case or controversy here at all			1
both ms. @entity38 and the executive agree that @entity23 is unconstitutional and that ms. @entity38 was entitled to a [ tax ] refund			2
and the lower courts granted them all the relief they requested			0
only the @entity118 's intervention provides the adverseness that @entity142 [ federal court jurisdiction ] demands			1
" but the @entity11 said it alone should present the government 's case			1
" @entity98 lack " any basis for supplanting the executive branch 's exclusive role in representing the @entity119 ' interests in this litigation , and has no interests of its own that would satisfy " federal court scrutiny , said administration lawyers			1
@entity38 's legal team also said the @entity118 leaders could defend @entity23 , at least partially , suggesting the woman wants ultimate resolution on the constitutional questions as soon as possible			1
" i was devastated by the loss of the great love of my life , and i was also very sick , then had to deal with pulling together enough money to pay for the taxes , " the 83 - year - old @entity38 told @entity1 recently			0
" and it was deeply upsetting			0
" the story of @entity38 and @entity166 that fundamental unfairness , as @entity38 and her supporters see it , is at the center of @entity23 legal fight			2
in november , three states -- @entity172 , @entity0 , and @entity173 -- approved same - sex marriage , adding to the six states and the @entity0 that already have done so			0
@entity177 voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment			0
as more states legalize same - sex marriage , one of the key questions the justices may be forced to address is whether a national consensus now exists supporting the idea of expanding an " equal protection " right of marriage to homosexuals			0
a bill known as the @entity193 is working its way through @entity195 and would repeal @entity23			2
that law does not prohibit states from allowing same - sex marriages , but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states			0
most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers , who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans , and other benefits			0
many other states , including @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 , have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples -- a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law			2
but other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages			0
@entity61 's @entity62 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it			2
that makes it a somewhat unique legal case for review by the justices			2
the @entity23 cases are @entity119 v. @entity38 ( 12 - 307 ) and @entity117 of the @entity119 @entity118 v. @entity38 ( 12 - 785 ) .			1

the @entity11 files first in a series of legal briefs involving two big cases
@entity6 will hear arguments next month on @entity23
lawyers for @entity118 @entity116 say they should be able to defend the marriage law in court
@entity119 still *deciding* whether to intervene in second case involving @entity61 law
