@entity0 -- @entity3 ' tangled relationship with the @entity4 entered another phase monday , raising a new question about whether lawmakers are really experiencing the exchanges the way other @entity10 do			1
monday night was the deadline for members of @entity3 and the thousands of people who work on their staffs to sign up for the @entity4 exchanges , where they must go to get any job - related health benefits			1
but with technical problems popping up in the past few days , @entity19 administrators gave employees ( including elected members ) a safety net			1
if they were blocked by technical problems , staff members will still be able to sign up for another week			1
hence the question : is that a special break for @entity3 ? " i do n't think that 's anything special , " @entity29 , spokesman for the chief administrative officer of the @entity19 , told @entity1 on monday			1
" our employees face a deadline of midnight tonight , and if through no fault of their own they 're unable to sign up , then they 're being allowed to follow through on their signing up			0
" now who 's having trouble with health care sign - up ? ask @entity3 throughout the day monday , a steady stream of staffers stopped by the @entity19 payroll and benefits office to check that their sign - up had in fact been verified			1
the workers asking questions and those answering them seemed at ease			0
there were no signs of stress or deadline panic as each worker sat down for the few - minute confirmation process			0
" this notice confirms your application for employer - sponsored insurance offered by @entity19 was received and approved , " read the short letters given to verified staff members and shown to @entity1 by several employees monday			1
@entity1 spoke with some two dozen workers who were checking their health care sign - up			0
none would allow their names to be used , saying they did not have authorization to speak to the media			0
but all of them -- republicans and @entity74 -- said they felt the potential deadline extension was appropriate			0
the question of special treatment for @entity3 and @entity4 keeps rising like a bad cough , in large part because no other company or individual faces @entity3 ' odd combination of requirements and circumstances			1
@entity86 sen. @entity85 latest to sign up for @entity4 , refuse subsidy the exchanges were designed for small companies , with fewer than 50 workers , and individuals who do n't have any employer coverage			1
@entity3 , on the other hand , employs some 20,000 people			2
most companies that size negotiate their own employee plans and enrollment windows with health insurers			0
but because @entity3 wanted to taste the medicine of @entity4 firsthand , the @entity4 mandates that the only way members or staff can get health care benefits is by signing up on an exchange			1
that means they can still buy health insurance off the exchange , but if they do , they will not get the thousands of dollars in premium help that comes as a benefit of their jobs			0
because of this , @entity3 has an enrollment cutoff date , something that makes it different from the start			2
outside of @entity3 , there is no enrollment cutoff date			2
of course , the exchanges do have some deadlines : you must sign up by december 23 to get insurance coverage starting january 1 , and by march 1 , almost every @entity10 must have health care or be penalized			2
but those deadlines are attached to specific events ; there is no time that enrollment closes altogether			0
@entity128 urges young supporters to talk up @entity4 the @entity130 confirmed that the exchanges allow people to sign up for health care year - round and that @entity3 is an exception			1
thus , only @entity3 has both a requirement to go on the exchanges to get employee health benefits and a firm enrollment cutoff date			2
that cuttoff date was set up by the federal @entity139 and mirrors the sign - up dates for all federal workers			0
as problems bubbled up for congressional staffers , last week @entity139 's director gave the @entity146 and @entity19 discretion to help individuals who have tried to sign up but were blocked by technical problems			1
is that special treatment ? @entity1 asked experts and members from both parties and could not find anyone who thought so			0
" nobody here felt this was anything special , " said @entity29			0
" this is just the right thing to do			0
" @entity86 repeal efforts go silent as @entity4 ' suicide ' plays out			2

members of @entity3 and their staffs got an extension to sign up for @entity4
the extension is so staff can enroll and also receive subsidies
most @entity19 and @entity146 members and staffs must get insurance through @entity4
