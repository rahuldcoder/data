-- this month , @entity2 's deputy prime minister squared up to the leader of the country 's euroskeptic @entity4 to advocate the merits of his nation 's membership of the @entity9			1
so did @entity10 convince the electorate in this televised debate that @entity2 was better off inside the union ? in short , no. for all @entity10 's passion for @entity16 , polls showed two thirds of those asked thought his opponent , @entity19 , had won the day by suggesting the @entity2 's future was brighter outside the bloc -- not in			1
as an island nation with its own regional identity politics to consider , @entity2 knows what it 's like having ambivalent bedfellows			1
the eurozone crisis has prompted @entity28 to advocate closer cooperation within the bloc , but the @entity2 has n't just been swimming against the tide on that topic -- it 's also been trying to prevent @entity33 from leaving its own union			2
@entity19 , a member of the @entity36 and staunch europhobe , paints a controversial figure among eurocrat circles			0
he has suggested that the @entity9 will end in tears , with people taking to the streets if countries see their democracy further eroded			2
@entity10 , by contrast , points to the massive advantage the common market awards @entity2 manufacturers and the stability the @entity9 has brought this once war - torn region			1
both claims may be exaggerated and the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle			0
one thing is certain -- the discussion highlights how @entity16 's union needs to be more receptive to its members ' changing needs			1
@entity2 was never a member of the original " @entity64 " nations that laid the foundations for what the @entity9 has become today			1
yet @entity2 's recent and very public soul - searching has become a source of exasperation for @entity69 leaders like the @entity71 chancellor @entity70			2
@entity2 prime minister @entity72 has promised his people a referendum on the subject if his @entity76 is reelected next year and has lobbied @entity28 hard on the need for reform and cumbersome treaty change			0
the incontrovertible fact is that as the @entity9 has become bigger and its bureaucracy has ballooned , it has n't kept pace with some of its members changing economies -- in particular @entity2 's			1
some might argue that what started out as an economic bloc has also overplayed its hand , drifting into notoriously torpid areas like justice and foreign policy			0
while the single market undoubtedly has myriad benefits for the exports of @entity2 goods , it has n't helped the nation 's services sector anywhere near as much			2
a report by @entity100 written in 2012 found that although nearly three quarters of the @entity2 's gdp comes from services , just 3.2 % of that is generated by @entity106 trade			2
reels of bureaucratic red tape and grandiose pronouncements about regulating the financial services industry -- the jewel in its capital 's crown -- have left @entity2 feeling singled out in the single market			1
this comes just as the other goal of the @entity9 -- the free movement of people -- has made immigration soar			0
add to this edicts from the @entity122 and increasingly protectionist economic directives , jarring with a @entity2 which sees a bright future in trade with other partners like the @entity127 and @entity128			0
the net result : @entity2 has been left feeling its sovereignty has been eroded , shackled by laws made elsewhere			1
there are a few options for the @entity2 should it wish to surrender its membership card			0
it could emulate models followed by @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , becoming part of the @entity141 or signing individual ad hoc cooperation agreements with individual countries over which it has more control			0
it could even make a clean break and just be part of a ( now increasingly irrelevant ) @entity149			0
none of these would be good for @entity2 or the world economy			0
they would require major upheaval and sour its investment climate considerably			0
@entity2 's potential exit may also throw a spanner in the works as the @entity9 and the @entity127 negotiate the world 's largest free trade agreement -- one which would open up each other 's goods to a 700 million - strong consumer market			1
yet the @entity2 economy is growing much faster than its @entity9 neighbors and as the nation rebounds the confidence of its convictions has also strengthened			1
@entity170 , one of @entity2 's most successful comedy exports , once asked : " what have the @entity174 ever done for us ? " now a whole nation is asking the same of @entity16			2
and whether they are right to do so or not , @entity28 better take note			0
