-- with dark clouds gathering over the @entity4 economy , the government has started to talk about the importance of supporting growth and speculation is mounting about what actions it will take			1
some analysts predict that it will dust off its 2008 playbook and announce a large - scale stimulus package			1
but others say this is unlikely because @entity16 is both less perturbed by the current slowdown and more wary of the dangers of another spending spree			1
here is a look at @entity4 's policy options , with an assessment of their likelihood			0
stick to the original plan concerns about fallout from a shaky domestic property market and @entity31 's debt woes are hardly new in @entity4			0
these concerns have been around for nearly a year , during which time officials have been very cautious in loosening monetary policy and increasing fiscal spending			0
@entity16 has cut the portion of deposits that banks must hold in reserve twice since november , injecting more cash into the economy			1
it also has stepped up efforts to construct 36m units of affordable housing by 2015 , a big investment programme			0
on the currency front , it has let the renminbi fall a touch against the dollar this year to aid struggling exporters			0
at the same time , the government has started to implement longer - term tax and financial sector reforms that are part of its strategy for shifting the economy away from a reliance on investment towards consumption			1
until recently , @entity16 was content to continue down this gradualist path			1
the economy has clearly slowed , but at 8.1 per cent annual growth in the first quarter , it has hardly collapsed			2
importantly , unlike 2008 when 20m blue - collar workers lost their jobs virtually overnight , there are few signs of labour market distress			1
without a more serious plunge in domestic economic growth or a crisis in @entity31 , the original plan -- gradual monetary easing , some additional fiscal spending , especially on affordable homes , plus longer - term structural reforms -- still looks compelling			2
" for @entity16 , the first thing it should do is to seriously deliver what it has scheduled for 2012 instead of rushing to announce any new massive stimulus plans , " says @entity79 , an economist with @entity80			1
stimulus - lite confidence in the strength of the @entity4 economy has wobbled over the past few weeks			1
april data , from power output to bank lending , were disappointing and indicated that the economic slowdown , far from abating , was worsening			0
one month does not make a trend , but the government appears to be taking out insurance against the signs of trouble			2
premier @entity97 said last week that the government should " give more priority to maintaining growth " , a comment that was seen as the starting gun for bolder fiscal spending plans			2
there has been a flurry of headlines in recent days in official media about investment projects , from airport expansions to new steel plants , which have been approved by the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) , a powerful central planning agency			0
the government has also unveiled or is set to unveil a number of small measures to encourage consumption , including subsidies for energy efficient appliances and another cash - for - clunkers car initiative			2
however , in contrast to 2008 , the government has played down expectations about the size of the potential stimulus -- and even denied that there is really any stimulus in the works at all			1
the @entity127 , a newspaper published by the @entity128 , said this week : " even if the @entity111 is busier than usual , this does not mean there is a new economic stimulus plan			2
" in this scenario there would be no official " stimulus package " , and no significant easing of monetary policy or property market restrictions			2
instead the government would rely on economic " fine - tuning " , such as accelerated investments and consumer subsidies , in order to provide a clear boost to growth			1
" all these signs indicate to us that a new round of fiscal stimulus has started , although its scale remains to be seen , and is not likely to be comparable with the ' shock and awe ' stimulus in 2008 - 09 , " says @entity144 with @entity145			1
re-run of 2008 the 2008 - 09 stimulus -- about 10 per cent of gdp at @entity155 ( $ 630bn ) -- left @entity4 with a double mess of soaring debt levels and stubbornly high inflation that the government spent much of last year trying to clean up			1
this experience has made @entity16 extremely hesitant to crank up another big stimulus			1
but such reluctance would easily dissipate if the growth downturn becomes much more severe			0
@entity164 , a top domestic investment bank , warned last week that the economy could slow to 6.4 per cent this year without policy stimulus , well below the 7 - 8 per cent level that @entity16 believes is necessary to create enough jobs for new entrants into the labour force			1
so some analysts are beginning to discuss the potential for a replay of the 2008 " big bang " spending programme , albeit with some modifications			0
this time around , investment might be directed towards power production , clean energy , and water infrastructure rather than transport networks , as was the case in 2008			0
@entity182 , an economist with @entity183 , said the headline figure could be as much as @entity185 , half as much as three years ago but much bigger than anything that has been officially mentioned this time around			0
beyond fiscal stimulus , the government has other big levers within its grasp			2
in 2008 it aggressively cut interest rates and also sharply reversed course on its tight property policy			0
these moves were integral to the @entity4 recovery in 2009 , but they also fuelled a surge in housing prices			0
similar moves would again be powerful -- if potentially dangerous -- medicine for the @entity4 economy			0
some economists think it 's too early for such a strong prescription			0
" we do not currently look for interest rate cuts or explicit central government loosening of real estate policy , but these will come in the third quarter if the economy is not responding , " @entity207 economists wrote in a note			0

the government has started to talk about the importance of supporting growth
speculation has mounted on what form any new stimulus will take
will @entity16 stay the course , have ' stimulus - lite ' , or a re-run 2008 boost ?
