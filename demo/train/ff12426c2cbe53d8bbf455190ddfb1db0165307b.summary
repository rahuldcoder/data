@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 called on the ruling @entity5 party saturday to endorse prime minister @entity6 for president in 2012			1
@entity6 in turn suggested that @entity2 should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in december , in what would be a straight swap of roles			1
@entity6 has already served two terms as the country 's president from 2000 to 2008			1
it had not been clear until now whether @entity2 , his protege , would seek to run for a second term in presidential elections due to take place in march , fueling months of speculation			1
addressing the party congress in @entity0 , @entity2 said he wanted to answer the important question of who would be the party 's presidential candidate -- and that he believed it should be @entity6 , the party 's chairman			1
the ruling party 's endorsement makes it highly likely that @entity6 will be returned to the country 's top office , observers say			2
@entity2 's remarks were interrupted by applause as the crowd gave @entity6 a standing ovation			2
" this applause spares me the need to explain what experience and authority @entity6 possesses , " @entity2 said			2
he explained the long delay in making clear which of them would run for president next year as an issue of " political expediency , " saying they had to play by the rules of politics			0
@entity2 , who said he accepted @entity6 's proposal that he stand for prime minister , said the government had succeeded in restoring a country that had been in " a deep decline , in a systemic crisis " a decade ago			1
" by our common efforts we 've managed to preserve and restore our beloved fatherland , our @entity3			0
and we will not give it back to anyone , " he said			0
" we will not give it back to those who want to destroy it , to those who deceive people by giving them empty and unfeasible slogans and promises			0
" in his own speech , @entity6 said it was a great honor to run for president and that his voice of command " is not lost			0
" he said he wanted to see economic growth in @entity3 increase to 6 - 7 % in the near future			1
in the next five years , @entity3 should be among the five most powerful economies in the world , he said			0
@entity6 also set out the task of fully rearming the @entity3 armed forces in the next five to 10 years			2
@entity6 said he was sure the @entity5 party , whose election ticket will be headed by @entity2 , would win december 's parliamentary elections			1
@entity2 would " be able to build a new , efficiently - functioning and young team of managers , and lead the government so as to continue modernization of all aspects of our lives , " @entity6 added			2
for more than two years , @entity6 and @entity2 have repeatedly said they would decide together which of them would run for the @entity3 presidency in 2012 , fanning the flames of intrigue			1
even during his time as prime minister , @entity6 has been widely perceived as the senior member of the @entity3 " ruling tandem			1
" @entity6 had stepped down in 2008 because the @entity3 constitution at that time limited a president to two consecutive four - year terms			1
under amendments to the constitution that came into force on december 31 , 2008 , the presidential term was extended to six years			0
this means that if @entity6 is elected in march 2012 for six years , he would be eligible to run for another six - year term after that , potentially keeping him in charge until 2024			0
under the same constitutional amendments the term for parliament members was extended from four to five years			0
currently , the @entity5 controls more than 300 seats in the 450 - seat @entity119 , the lower chamber of the @entity3 parliament			0
more than 10,000 people attended the party congress , held in @entity0 's @entity123			0
@entity1 's @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
