-- low levels of vitamin d have been linked to an array of health problems , including bone fractures , heart disease , and depression			1
efforts to prevent these and other ills by prescribing vitamin d supplements have n't always panned out , however			2
now vitamin d seems to have struck out against the common cold			0
although the nutrient is thought to play a key role in immune function , a new clinical trial suggests that even high doses of supplements are powerless to ward off upper respiratory tract infection -- an umbrella diagnosis that covers colds and flu , as well as sinus infections and other related problems			1
the study , which was published this week in the @entity27 , included 322 healthy adults in @entity29 and found that those who took large monthly doses of vitamin d developed just as many infections over an 18 - month period as their counterparts who took a placebo			1
the people in the vitamin d group came down with an average of 3.7 bouts of cold or flu , compared to 3.8 in the placebo group -- a statistically negligible difference			2
nor did vitamin d have any measurable impact on the severity of symptoms , their duration ( about 12 days per episode in each group ) , or the number of workdays missed			0
@entity0 : superfoods that fight colds the findings reinforce the uncertainty surrounding vitamin d and cold prevention			2
at least two previous clinical trials have produced similarly disappointing results , although some research has been more promising			0
a placebo - controlled study published in august , for instance , found that supplements halved the incidence of colds in vitamin - d deficient schoolchildren			1
but the new study is the first to examine the real - world effects of supplements in adults with healthy vitamin d levels			1
and the results suggest that raising vitamin d levels above average does n't provide additional protection against colds , says dr. @entity74 , an associate physician at @entity75 in @entity76			1
@entity77 , he adds , should probably be placed alongside the many other popular cold - and - flu remedies -- such as vitamin c , zinc , echinacea , and garlic -- whose supposed benefits have not stood up to clinical trials			1
we all get them , and they make us all miserable , and i do n't think we 're going to come up with a way around that , " says @entity86 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study			0
" besides eating a balanced diet with lots of vitamins and minerals , and exercising , and generally living a healthy life , it 's unlikely that we 're going to find one single pill or cure that 's going to prevent them or lessen their severity			2
" @entity0 : how to stop a cold in its tracks dr. @entity107 , the lead author of the study and a pathologist at the @entity110 , in @entity29 , says it 's too soon to rule out vitamin d for cold prevention altogether			1
more research will be needed to confirm that supplements lack cold - fighting properties , he says , and to determine whether certain types of infections or certain populations respond to the added nutrient better than others			0
" this study highlights the need for good quality studies to look at each potential health benefit before making broad recommendations , " @entity107 says			0
" the beneficial evidence for immunity ( is ) still being sorted out , so we still need to focus on the evidence			0
" @entity0 : 12 ways to get your daily vitamin d @entity77 is not found naturally in most foods , but some products , like milk , are fortified to include it			1
our bodies also make the vitamin when our skin is exposed to sunlight			0
spending a few minutes outside each day is typically enough to maintain healthy vitamin d levels , but many people fall short -- especially in the wintertime -- and may want to ask their doctor about supplements			1
supplements for run - of - the - mill vitamin - d deficiency are different from those used in the study			2
in order to ensure that everyone received a full dose , the researchers gave the participants 200,000 international units ( @entity157 ) once a month for the first two months , and then 100,000 @entity157 a month after that			0
that works out to about 3,300 @entity157 per dayâ € ” more than five times the recommended daily intake ( 600 @entity157 ) for most adults			0

@entity77 is thought to play a key role in immune function
but a new study shows it 's *ineffective* in warding off colds , flu and sinus infections
the study is the first to measure effects of supplements in adults with healthy vitamin d levels
