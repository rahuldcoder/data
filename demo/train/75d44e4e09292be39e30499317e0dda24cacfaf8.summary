in the early days of the internet boom , some thought we would enter an era where there would be one integrated world economy with no borders , where we would share similar democratic values , and where governments would be less important and civil society could pick up many governmental tasks			2
but that turned out not to be the case			2
many countries do n't share our values			1
there are conflicts , and the @entity17 has become a good place for these conflicts to play out			2
one outcome is espionage , whether it is the @entity22 listening to foreign leaders or @entity25 's @entity24 stealing trade secrets			0
it seems every month there is a story about a giant retailer being hacked and the personal data of hundreds of thousands of people being stolen by faceless cybercriminals			1
the last big story was @entity35			1
this week it 's @entity38 , where hackers stole electronic credentials from @entity38 employees and used the credentials to access and steal customers ' data			1
according to one estimate , more than 800 million records were stolen in 2013			0
fortunately , that does n't actually mean all 800 million people suffered financial loss			1
only a small fraction of people who have their data taken become victims of fraud or theft , because it is hard for criminals to " monetize " data -- to turn your personal information into cash			1
but the cleanup costs for the victimized company can be gigantic			0
after @entity35 's hack , its ceo was fired for not doing enough			0
cybercrime is a growth industry and online security breaches are not going to stop any time soon			1
the @entity17 was designed to ensure easy , reliable connectivity and in this it has been an immense success			0
when the @entity17 was commercialized in the 1990s , the @entity72 government thought it was better to immediately start using an imperfect technology and get the economic benefits rather than wait for a completely safe @entity17			0
that was the right decision			0
the @entity17 has drastically changed all facets of our lives , including the way we communicate and do business			0
it has brought us immense economic benefits			0
but the downside is that the @entity17 is not a secure place			0
cybersecurity would not be as big a problem as it is today if the pioneers had paid more attention to security issues			1
for example , encryption ( software that scrambles your data into unintelligible patterns ) was decontrolled in 1999			2
but many encryption products turned out to be hard to use , slowing computers and adding cumbersome steps to simple transactions			2
encryption is still not widely used			0
many companies do n't encrypt the data of their customers and rely on passwords , which are very easy to hack for many transactions			1
cybercrime is an issue that needs more attention			2
according to one @entity109 intelligence service , there are 20 to 30 criminal gangs in the @entity111 that have hacking skills as good as most nations			0
there are many other groups with lesser skills			0
these criminals are nimble and inventive , and there are thriving cybercrime black markets where you can buy the latest hacking tools			2
this means there are highly skilled criminals who live in safe havens but can use the @entity17 to commit crimes that can earn millions of dollars , for which they will never be arrested or tried			0
why would they stop ? while there is good cooperation among @entity133 countries against cybercrime , @entity129 has little interest in stopping these groups			1
eventually , the @entity17 will become less risky			0
there are basic things that companies can do to make sure their networks are more secure -- at least from all but the high - end criminals and big intelligence agencies			1
many companies are now taking cybersecurity seriously in a way different from even a year or two ago			2
the @entity72 can work with other governments to improve law enforcement cooperation and to close down criminal networks			0
the question is whether there will be enough progress before hackers get better at using what they steal			1
right now , cybercriminals can steal millions of records but only be able to " monetize " a few thousand of them			2
if cybercriminals get better at monetizing the personal data they steal , there will be a spike in losses			1
and if countries like @entity25 continues to hack @entity72 businesses to steal trade secrets and make competing products , @entity72 companies will lose sales and jobs			1
the @entity38 hack reminds us that cybercrime is risk free , hard to stop , and big money for hackers			1
even the best defenses may have holes in them			0
the least we can do is to try to put in the safeguards .			1

hackers take electronic info from @entity38 employees to steal customers ' data
@entity186 : cybercrime is a growth industry and breaches wo n't stop
he says cybercrime is risk free , hard to stop , and big money for hackers
@entity186 : the least that companies can do is to put in more safeguards
