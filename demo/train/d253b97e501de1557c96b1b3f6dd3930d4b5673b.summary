@entity0 , @entity1 -- off - camera , i 'm getting parenting advice from @entity1 's first athlete to win gold in any sport at the @entity9			1
" your daughter should go for ice skating , " @entity10 advises me			0
" it 's great for her balance ! " my five - year old is more swimmer than skater but i appreciate @entity10 's words and especially her intention			0
she 's encouraging me to share the life - changing benefits of sport , not to necessarily groom a future olympian			2
@entity10 herself is a product of a vigorous state system that created elite national athletes			1
she brought home that long - awaited gold medal in short - track speed skating from the @entity33 in 2002			0
to realize her dream , @entity10 tells me she skated for 23 years , six days a week , for almost 12 hours a day			0
" once you become an athlete , you want to win			0
that 's the most important thing , " she says			0
kids driven away while @entity10 says there is nothing wrong with winning , @entity40 , who works as a coach and educator in a grassroots football program , says that winning has become so overly emphasized that it discourages children from sport			1
" winning of course is a natural response for every athlete , " @entity40 says			0
" but it can also get in the way			0
and this is what 's happening in grassroots sports all over @entity1 , is that the winning has become so important , it drives kids out of the sport			1
" @entity1 may have taken gold in plenty of @entity64 events , from speed skating to gymnastics , but it struggles to simply qualify for the @entity67 or generate mainstream interest in its bid to host the 2022 @entity9			1
@entity40 blames a fixation on training elite champions in select sports and an education system that considers sports a luxury and not a priority			1
" in the @entity79 , we look more at physical education as part of education , whereas here , for many years , the educators have tried to keep sport out of education , " he tells me			1
presidential backing but @entity64 chief @entity88 assures me that will change			0
" i had the opportunity to meet president @entity93 twice , " says the @entity91 president			0
" you see clearly the government has realized that sport must be part of education and that sport helps in education			1
" @entity40 is doing his part as the @entity101 to the @entity102 , a project that works with two million children in more than 6,200 schools across @entity1			1
his success at teaching football skills to students in @entity109 earned him stardom there , and an invitation to bring his technical magic to @entity1			2
but while charismatic coaches fan out across @entity1 's schools -- and @entity93 proclaims his love for football -- it could take years to change the nation 's attitude toward sport ... and for @entity1 to build an industry around it			1
@entity125 - based @entity124 is one of @entity1 's top sports agents			2
he laments how professional sports in @entity1 lack the infrastructure to make more money for his clients , like professional boxer and @entity64 gold medalist @entity133			2
" if you come through the national system , you have the coach and the training system , " @entity124 says			2
" but there 's a whole system behind a ( professional ) athlete : the pr , the brand , the corporate sponsorship , helping them find the best coaches outside the system			0
" that 's a whole new system we 're starting to build			0
" @entity64 bid @entity10 is supporting @entity1 's athletes after their @entity64 dream with the @entity151 she started as part of her foundation			1
she 's also getting more children interested in sport with a new skating school in @entity125 that is open to everyone			2
on top of that , she 's leading the charge for @entity1 's bid to host the 2022 @entity9			1
@entity1 , along with @entity164 and @entity165 , is a finalist to host the event			2
winning the bid and hosting the games would transform the sport scene in @entity1 , sparking greater interest in winter sports like snowboarding , skiing and skating			1
more than a decade ago , @entity10 was in it to win it			0
today , she 's using her @entity64 legacy to bring a love of her sport to the masses .			0

@entity1 has created a vigorous state system that has produced elite national athletes
but some argue the emphasis on winning has discouraged many children
at the other *end* of the scale , sport is not considered a part of your education in @entity1
@entity1 has also struggled in sports like football , interest in holding a @entity9 is low
