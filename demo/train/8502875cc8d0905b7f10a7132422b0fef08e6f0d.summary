@entity0 , @entity1 -- sitting at the first @entity6 ceo forum this week , in the heart of @entity0 , i asked myself if this was the right time to open the debate on @entity6 's private sector future			1
was @entity0 the right place ? critics will rightly argue that this sort of event should have been held in @entity6			1
over two intensive days , top @entity6 chief executive officers shared with attendees from all over the @entity6 , @entity16 and @entity17 , some latest trends and best practices , discussed the future of the continent 's private sector , and received awards and accolades			1
speakers such as the outspoken @entity27 - born billionaire @entity26 tried to boost the narratives of @entity6 's position compared to @entity30 and @entity31 but with little solutions to offer			1
when i asked him why the event was not held in @entity34 or @entity35 , @entity26 replied by stating that the reasons were more infrastructural and logistical than anything else			0
@entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity42 's vice president for @entity6 ) , and @entity43 ( chairman of the @entity45 ) also sent some very strong messages to @entity6 ceos by reminding them to promote @entity6 's private sector			1
@entity40 said : " this ceo @entity49 reminds us that @entity6 needs its business leaders as never before -- to help it generate more electricity , grow more food , and create more jobs to keep growing strongly , while also improving people 's well - being through less poverty , better health and education , and more hope			1
" read related : how ' @entity61 ' will shape @entity6 's future despite the positive kick - off , the conference saw the presence of few women ceos and panelists , which demonstrated the need to push @entity6 women into the board room			1
however , women like @entity74 @entity73 ( @entity75 ) and @entity76 from the women @entity77 , made their voices strongly heard			0
@entity79 stressed the need for challenging and removing bad leaders in politics and in our organizations			0
" we must not allow nepotism and tribalism to exist in our organizations , " she said			0
" we must create a culture of performance not mediocrity			0
" she added : " it is our responsibility as @entity6 to build a better business environment and create talent for our people			1
" @entity76 emphasized the importance of educating the youth , as they are the future of @entity6 , and of creating entrepreneurs and adding vocational training to employment policies and agendas			2
a recurring theme at the event was that @entity6 needs more champions -- the likes of @entity108 , ceo of @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 , ceo of @entity112 and @entity113 , ceo of @entity114			1
the last two were respectively named @entity116 and @entity6 ceo of the @entity118			1
this event was extremely timely , current and relevant			0
timely , because @entity6 's growth has been consistent in the past decade -- almost 6 % growth per year			1
the global crisis in @entity16 is not stopping @entity6 's growth			2
read related : @entity123 : shaping @entity6 's tech revolution current , because the narratives about @entity6 need to change ; we are witnessing great progress in the continent and this needs to be highlighted			1
relevant , because @entity6 ceos need a platform where they can share and learn from one another			2
most of the @entity6 ceos have never met before but share common problems			2
however , only time will tell what impact the event will have on the @entity130 when they return home			0
a conference in @entity0 can only ever be one step towards solving them			2
good governance and transparency are still a challenge in @entity6			2
african ceos need to implement good procurement systems to fight corruption and leaks			0
they must create a culture of performance and challenge mediocrity at its core			0
the forum was packed with journalists from all around the world including young @entity6 bloggers and journalists from @entity160 's biggest newsrooms			2
the question we are all asking ourselves now is how can we create , maintain and retain talent in @entity6 ? as the @entity166 competition team travels to find the next tech ceo in @entity6 , all these questions were left unanswered at the @entity6 ceo forum			1
the forum failed to talk about the youth of @entity6 , the @entity171 , technology hubs , and the growth of micro-economic dynamism we are seeing today			2
it dramatically failed to address what development strategies @entity6 companies should employ to sustain and scale up their businesses			2
@entity180 : 10 @entity6 tech voices to follow on twitter ceos did not fail by any means to demonstrate that @entity6 is changing and growing despite all the negatives press			0
their energy and enthusiasm were palpable			0
the continent is needed more than ever , they said , but i think @entity6 ceos must start working together , trusting each other , thinking of implementing a regional integration package and finding a route for transferring solutions between @entity6 countries			1
they must have a common platform where they can continue to learn from each other and share ideas			0
collaboration is imperative amongst the @entity130 of @entity6			0
after all , the only way their individual successes is to be measured and defined is how people 's lives have changed , how many jobs are created , how many people get access to information , and how much their human resources have progressed			0
let 's be honest -- @entity6 still faces great challenges			1
investors are still reluctant to invest -- there are huge barriers			0
starting a business is not always straight forward in may countries in @entity6 , the business ecosystem is almost non existent in many countries , we still have electricity issues , getting funding to start a business is still challenging in most parts of @entity6 , people are n't trained enough to execute essentials jobs , degrees gained by most @entity6 are useless or have no purpose in the job markets			1
these entire impediments must be addressed			0
change is imminent ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			0
