-- the @entity2 administration has issued a disaster declaration for the @entity5 town hit by fertilizer plant blasts in april			1
the @entity7 announced friday aid for the area affected by the tragedy in the town of @entity12			2
federal funding will supplement state and local recovery efforts " for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the explosion in @entity21 , " @entity7 said			2
the april 17 fire led to simultaneous blasts at a fertilizer distribution facility , killing 15 and decimating homes , businesses and more within 37 blocks			1
this decision came after @entity7 in june told gov. @entity29 it was denying a request to declare the small town a " major disaster " area , a move sharply criticized by local and state officials			1
the letter from @entity7 spokesman @entity37 noted @entity2 had previously issued an emergency declaration and other measures that paved the way for some direct federal assistance			0
" based on our review of all of the information available , it has been determined that the remaining costs for permanent work is within the capabilities of the state and affected local governments , " @entity37 said at the time			0
" accordingly , we have determined that a major disaster declaration is not necessary			1
" after the friday announcement , @entity29 , who slammed the @entity7 move two months ago , lauded a successful state appeal of the initial federal move			1
" the approval of the state 's appeal for a major disaster declaration is great and welcome news for the people of @entity12 , " @entity29 said			1
" i appreciate everyone who joined me in standing with the people whose lives have been forever impacted to move this appeal forward , especially our congressional delegation			0
" @entity29 said the federal action and the state legislature 's disaster relief funding " will help this community rebuild their infrastructure , school district and public works as quickly as possible			2
" a fire at the facility operated by @entity77 set off two explosions that registered on seismographs as a magnitude - 2.1 earthquake and were felt 50 miles away			0
the blasts leveled a portion of the town , damaging numerous homes , a nursing home and the town 's high school and middle school			0
according to local officials , the city is still well short of the $ 17 million it needs to repair roads , water and sewage lines and other damaged infrastructure			0
