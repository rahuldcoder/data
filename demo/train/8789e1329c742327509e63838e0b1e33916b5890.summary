@entity1 @entity0 of @entity2 took to the @entity4 floor on tuesday to discuss the shutdown debate in remarks that headed deep into the night -- a dramatic step in defense of his high profile and controversial plan to prevent any funding for @entity12			1
" i intend to speak in support of defunding @entity12 until i am no longer able to stand , " he said			2
" all across this country , @entity14 are suffering because of @entity12			2
" @entity0 , who began speaking shortly after 2:40 p.m. et , was alone for nearly an hour before being joined by sen. @entity16 , a @entity17 @entity1			2
the @entity19 allies engaged in an extended dialogue that was part stamina test for @entity0 and part political theater for the rest of @entity24			2
@entity0 was later briefly joined by other @entity1 senators , @entity26 of @entity27 , another @entity19 favorite , @entity29 of @entity30 , and sen. @entity31 spoke as well			2
" how many more @entity14 will have to see their wages or their hours cut as a result of this ill - conceived law before we do something about this ? " @entity29 asked			0
as @entity0 got going , he raised a number of points about the issue at hand			0
" this fight is not about any member of this body			0
this fight is not about personalities			0
look , most @entity14 could not give a flying flip about a bunch of politicians in @entity49			0
who cares ? almost all of us are in cheap suits with bad haircuts ! who cares ? " he said			0
he also read from the dr. @entity58 children 's classic " @entity59 " to his daughters as the night wore on			0
there was also a sharp exchange with sen. @entity63 of @entity64 , who was was the first @entity65 to question @entity0 during his remarks			0
@entity0 's comments were not -- in and of themselves -- a filibuster , a practice made famous by @entity71 in the 1939 movie " @entity73 , " when @entity4 business was brought to a halt through one lengthy , uninterrupted speech			1
they were , however , part of an ongoing attempted filibuster by some @entity4 conservatives			0
@entity0 and a few others in the @entity1 caucus are trying to prevent the @entity4 from taking up the government funding bill passed last week by the @entity1 - controlled @entity83			1
@entity0 and his tea party allies support the @entity83 bill , which removes funding for the implementation of president @entity89 's health care law , but do n't want to give majority leader @entity90 and other @entity91 a chance to amend the measure by restoring @entity12 funding			1
@entity90 had filed a motion to break the filibuster before @entity0 rose to speak			2
the clock was already ticking on the @entity4 's first key procedural vote on the matter , which will take place shortly after 1 p.m. et on wednesday regardless of what @entity0 does			1
@entity90 needs 60 votes in order to break the attempted filibuster and formally kick off debate on the @entity83 bill			1
there are 54 members of the @entity109 caucus , which means the support of at least six @entity1 will be required			0
once the formal debate has started , however , @entity90 will only need 50 votes to make changes to the @entity83 measure			1
" any senator who votes ( to move forward with debate on the @entity83 bill ) is voting to give @entity90 the authority to fund @entity12 , " @entity0 told @entity116 's @entity115 on monday , firing a warning shot at his fellow @entity4 republicans			1
@entity1 infighting over how best to prevent a government shutdown while defunding @entity12 escalated further on tuesday , as senate minority leader @entity123 , @entity124 , publicly dismissed @entity0 's more confrontational strategy			1
" i do n't think that filibustering a bill that defunds @entity12 is the best route to defunding @entity12 , " @entity126 said on the @entity4 floor			1
" all it does is shut down the government and keep @entity12 funded , and none of us want that			2
" @entity0 's @entity1 critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal , arguing there is no way to stop @entity12 as long as @entity91 maintain control of the @entity4 and @entity89 himself remains in the @entity140			1
they believe that trying to do so by forcing a shutdown -- or preventing a hike in the debt ceiling next month -- will backfire by harming the economy and damaging the @entity1 brand			0
some republicans , like @entity126 , would at least like the opportunity to force vulnerable @entity91 to cast a politically tough vote on the @entity83 plan			1
@entity1 have " a rare opportunity to defund this law with a simple majority , " @entity126 added			0
" we should have that vote			0
" it remains to be seen how much pressure @entity0 and his tea party backers will ultimately put on other @entity1			0
@entity126 is up for reelection in 2014 , and his conservative @entity1 primary challenger wasted no time tuesday blasting the minority leader for opposing @entity0 's stance			1
" like so many other crucial fights , @entity123 has caved to @entity90 on @entity12 and is refusing to fight to defund this disastrous legislation , " @entity162 said			2
" i am proud to support conservatives like senator @entity0 in his fight to defund @entity12 , and i promise the people of @entity27 : i will never cave to @entity90			1
" for his part , @entity90 argued on the @entity4 floor that " just as the economy begins to gain steam , some republicans in @entity172 seem determined to derail four years of progress			1
" " they 're obsessed with defunding health care , " he said			0
" they 're pushing us closer and closer to a government shutdown that would tank the economy			0
