-- @entity2 director @entity1 called an incident in which a man scaled a fence and entered the @entity6 " unacceptable " and told a congressional committee tuesday that she takes " full responsibility			1
" @entity10 , a 42 - year - old knife - wielding @entity11 war veteran , entered an unlocked door to the executive mansion , @entity9 told the @entity15 , which grilled her on the september 19 security breach			1
a federal grand jury on tuesday indicted @entity10 on three separate federal and @entity21 charges that could carry a maximum of 17 years in prison			2
his first court appearance is expected wednesday in @entity21			0
the @entity6 door through which @entity26 barged had no remote locking mechanism and needed to be manually locked , @entity9 told lawmakers , adding that such a mechanism has since been installed			1
" it 's clear that our security plan was not properly executed , " she said			0
" i take full responsibility			0
what happened is unacceptable , and it will never happen again			0
" saying she could n't give complete responses because presidential protection is highly sensitive or classified , @entity9 said the incident remains under investigation , and she does n't " want to get ahead of the investigation			2
" it did n't come up at the hearing , but the @entity45 reported that the officer who tackled @entity10 was n't even on duty but was leaving a shift protecting the president 's daughters			2
republicans and @entity52 questioned how @entity10 penetrated " five rings of security " in jumping the @entity6 fence , overpowering a @entity2 officer and running deep into the @entity6 , where he was finally subdued			1
" how on earth did this happen ? " asked chairman @entity57			2
" why was there no guard stationed at the front door of the @entity6 , and yes , how much would it cost to lock the front door of the @entity6 ? " added rep. @entity65 , the top @entity66 on the panel , " i hate to even imagine what could have happened if @entity10 had been carrying a gun instead of a knife when he burst inside the @entity6			1
that possibility is extremely unsettling			0
" can the @entity2 actually change ? rep. @entity72 asked whether officers who caught @entity10 acted appropriately by not using lethal force			1
@entity9 said the @entity2 agents " did use restraint in making a very difficult decision " but conceded that she did n't believe the security plan was properly executed , which is why the incident is being reviewed			1
the @entity2 should take a more aggressive posture , not a restrained one , @entity72 said , and if agents kill someone who has breached @entity6 security , " i will have their back			1
" former secret service director @entity88 later said that neither he nor the @entity90 public wants the @entity2 's first reaction at seeing someone invade the @entity6 lawn to be : kill that person			1
but after 3Â½ hours , it was clear that the committee was n't confident in the agency 's own review			0
@entity57 concluded the hearing by saying he and @entity65 agreed that " an internal investigation by the secret service is not sufficient " and said they plan to formally request an independent inquiry			2
another security lapse meanwhile , in another incident involving a violation of security protocol , an armed security contractor was allowed on an elevator with president @entity110 during a visit to the @entity112 in @entity113 on september 16 , according to a whistleblower			1
this whistleblower spoke to @entity72 's office , and the incident was confirmed by a @entity2 official			2
@entity72 tweeted on tuesday evening , " security contractor with a gun next to the president happened two weeks ago , according to my whistleblower			0
" the security worker was acting strangely and had his phone out while on the elevator with the president , according to @entity72 's office			0
when the security worker was confronted about his behavior , it was revealed that he was armed			0
the incident was first reported by the @entity128 and was followed up with additional reporting by the @entity45			0
the @entity45 reported that the @entity2 was not aware he was armed until after the worker was confronted			2
@entity9 's future in question at the end of the public session of the congresssional hearing , @entity65 said " the jury is still out " on whether @entity9 can stay on in and fix the problems at the agency			0
asked about his confidence in the director 's ability to continue in her post , @entity57 told reporters , " this hearing did not add to my confidence			0
" over and over , @entity52 and @entity147 sharply criticized the @entity2 director 's leadership and expressed disbelief that no one at the agency had been held accountable			0
@entity9 noted she has been on the job for 18 months and took steps to reform the agency but also said , " when you bring change into an organization , there is pushback			0
" but @entity9 's testimony only appeared to further inflame some members of the committee			2
" i wish to @entity166 you had protected the @entity6 like you are protecting your reputation , " said a scolding rep. @entity168 , @entity169			2
holding up a sign featuring the blue @entity172 security logo , rep @entity173 , @entity171 , asked @entity9 , " have you ever heard of these guys ? " @entity6 fence jumpers @entity9 told the committee that people jump the @entity6 fence a few times a year			1
" @entity180 has apprehended 16 individuals who have jumped the fence over the last five years , including six this year alone			0
in fact , on september 11 , 2014 , a week prior to the events that are the subject of today 's hearing , officers apprehended an individual seconds after he scaled the fence and ran onto the grounds , " she said			0
sitting beside @entity9 , @entity88 said the " unprecedented and unacceptable " breach poses difficult questions about the use of lethal force and the tolerance for additional fortifications around the executive mansion			2
there are no easy answers , and long - term consequences of any changes must be thought through , he told the committee			0
last week , a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said that prior to the intrusion , @entity2 agents interviewed @entity10 twice before determining both times that they did n't have enough reason to keep him			1
@entity9 confirmed reports raised by a committee member that two @entity2 agents saw @entity10 near the @entity6 fence on september 19 , prior to the breach , and " observed him for some time			1
" ultimately , @entity9 said , the agents determined that @entity10 was n't acting inappropriately or violating any laws			1
opinion : do we want a fortress @entity6 ? later , referring to the @entity2 's contacts with @entity10 before the september 19 breach , she said there 's not a lot that the service can do to manage " people with mental illness who do not commit a crime			1
" the @entity2 has said @entity10 has acknowledged having post-traumatic stress disorder			1
" we 're limited by the system we have to work within : the laws of our country , " @entity9 said			0
incidents strain public trust the @entity10 breach and other " misbehaviors " and security failures by the @entity2 have " tested the trust of the @entity90 people " and blemished the @entity2 record , @entity57 said			1
the @entity239 @entity147 cited several examples of misbehavior , including a reality tv subject crashing a state dinner , a 2012 prostitution scandal , an agent falling asleep outside a room in the @entity247 and gunshots fired at the @entity6 in november 2011 , an incident in which damage was n't properly reported			2
committee members pointed out that in regard to the 2011 incident , the @entity45 reported a @entity2 employee was told to stand down after hearing gunshots near the @entity6 and then felt unable the next day to contradict her superiors ' false belief that the @entity6 was n't shot at			1
@entity65 called the report a " major problem , " and @entity9 said the contention that the officer did not challenge her supervisors for fear of being criticized is a concern			0
" it 's unacceptable , " she said			0
answering another question from @entity57 about why damage to the @entity6 was n't initially detected but rather found days later , @entity9 defended her agency 's response and said records show that the @entity2 " did respond properly " by sweeping the area to see whether anyone was injured and whether there were obvious signs of damage			1
rep. @entity276 and @entity9 had a contentious exchange over why the @entity2 did not know that the @entity6 had been struck by gunfire until days after the incident			1
@entity276 repeatedly asked @entity9 why a housekeeper -- and not the @entity2 -- discovered the damage to the mansion			1
she answered , in part , that agents swept the area that night to look for injuries or an intruder and found nothing			0
she noted that it was also difficult to see at night			0
@entity9 told the committee that any disciplinary action was pending the agency 's investigation of the @entity10 incident			1
but that answer did not satisfy @entity297 @entity52 rep. @entity296 , who told her " someone should be held accountable			0
" pressed by @entity72 about how many times she has personally briefed the president in 2014 about incidents involving his security @entity9 said once , and it was regarding the september incursion by @entity10			1
the committee said that it would hold an executive session after the hearing so that @entity9 could address some of the sensitive questions being asked			2
@entity0 's @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			0
