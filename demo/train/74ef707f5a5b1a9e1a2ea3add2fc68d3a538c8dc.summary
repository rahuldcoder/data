-- here 's a roundup of five medical studies published this week that might give you new insights into your health , mind and body			2
remember , correlation is not causation -- so if a study finds a connection between two things , it does n't mean one causes the other			1
good neighbors are good for your heart a study published monday in the @entity21 suggests your community matters in matters of the heart			1
researchers tracked the cardiovascular health of more than 5,000 seniors with no known heart problems over four years			1
in 2006 , participants in the @entity30 and @entity31 were asked how much they felt a part of their neighborhood , if they had neighbors who would help them , whether they trusted people in the area and if their neighbors were friendly			0
during the study period , 148 of the participants had a heart attack			1
researchers found people who reported feeling more " social cohesion " were less at risk			2
tight - knit local communities may help to reinforce and encourage certain types of behaviors that protect against cardiovascular damage , the study authors say			1
@entity50 , not so much			0
in june , the @entity51 issued draft recommendations that encourage pregnant women , breastfeeding mothers and young children to eat two to three servings of fish per week to aid fetal and childhood development			1
this fish should be low in mercury , the @entity51 said , because mercury can harm the brain and nervous system			0
this week food safety experts at @entity65 analyzed data from the @entity51 to find out what kinds of seafood are safe for these populations to eat regularly			1
they identified 20 types -- including salmon , shrimp , domestic crawfish and oysters -- that contain low levels of mercury and are safe to eat several times a week			2
the experts said pregnant women and children should steer clear of six types of seafood : swordfish , shark , king mackerel , gulf tilefish , marlin and orange roughy			1
if you are a frequent fish consumer , meaning you eat 24 ounces or more every week , @entity65 recommends you avoid those seafood types as well			1
researchers also found that canned tuna contained particularly high levels of mercury , and recommended pregnant women avoid it altogether			1
having a baby could hurt your ( mental ) health many new mothers are made aware of their risk for post-partum depression			1
but having a baby can put both moms and dads at risk for mental health disorders like anxiety , post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis , says @entity110 , who presented her study on perinatal mental health disorders at the @entity113 of the @entity114 this week			1
" ( post-partum depression ) has been framed so much as being a hormonal disorder , but the evidence there is actually very limited , " @entity115 said			0
" childbirth itself is a life change and a life stressor , so actually there 's far more evidence that those risk factors are the cause			2
" the @entity129 researcher conducted in - depth interviews with 17 new fathers and 30 new mothers			2
many said they experienced stress related to their relationships , family - work balance issues , and struggles with poverty			1
@entity115 encourages new parents to accept help from friends , family and the community during the early stages of their child 's life			2
cancer screening does n't always help data shows that screening people with a limited life expectancy for certain types of cancer does n't provide any benefit to their health -- and that treating any cancer found in these patients can do more harm than good			2
but seniors at high risk for death are still being screened frequently , according to a study published monday in @entity162			1
researchers looked at data from the @entity165 from 2000 to 2010 , on more than 27,000 participants over 64			0
at least a third of participants with the highest mortality risk had received a recent cancer screening , with 55 % undergoing prostate cancer screening			0
the analysis also showed that screening was common in participants with less than five years to live , the study authors say			0
" it is the physician 's responsibility to tailor treatment to the patient and his cancer , " writes dr. @entity176 , chief medical officer for the @entity177			0
" many @entity184 simply can not accept that there are cancers that do not need treatment			0
" violent video games may depress your fifth grader video games have long been a topic of intense debate			0
but most of these discussions have focused on how video games affect aggression or violent tendencies			0
a new study published in @entity200 , @entity201 , and @entity202 looked instead at video games and depression			0
researchers analyzed data from 5,147 fifth - grade students and their caregivers , who participated in another study			2
they found students who played high - violence video games for more than two hours a day had significantly more depressive symptoms than those who played low - violence video games for less than two hours a day			0
the researchers do n't know if the link between the two is cause - and - effect , meaning the video games cause depression or vice versa			0
more studies will have to be done to see if the association would last as the students grow older .			0
