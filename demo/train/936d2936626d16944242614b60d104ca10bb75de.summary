-- with @entity1 just a few weeks away , " @entity6 " is here with a whole new set of mutant horrors to populate your nightmares			1
on tuesday , the latest entry in @entity9 's massively popular pro basketball video - game series was released to rave reviews and crowds lining up for midnight release events			1
one of the game 's coolest features is a new face - scanning system that , on @entity16 and @entity17 , uses the console 's camera to let you make a @entity22 model of your face and create a custom character to play			1
except , well ... except that , sometimes , you get this : clearly , some players were having trouble with the scanning process			2
and , to the delight and sheer terror of the @entity33 , the results often ended up looking like something out of " @entity35 " or " @entity36			0
" the scan requires players to get very close to their camera and then rotate their head slowly over the course of about 30 seconds			1
in @entity9 's gaming forums , several threads popped up with players complaining about the glitch			2
others who had experienced similar trouble were offering advice			0
the most frequent suggestion was to open windows to let in natural light when conducting the scan			0
gamers on social media were , of course , having a ball with the freak show			0
" man , that new ' @entity63 ' is really shaping up , " wrote @entity58 , of gaming video channel @entity59 , referring to the classic horror game			0
" unclear why they 're calling it ' @entity6			1
' " and not all surprising face - scan results were of the soul - crushingly ugly variety			2
the folks over at @entity70 scanned @entity71 , one of their reporters ' dogs , and in our opinion , she looks ready to hit the hardwood			0

' @entity6 ' face scan feature is leading to *amusing* , horrifying images
the game was released today to long lines and *great* reviews
feature is meant to let players create a character with their own face
