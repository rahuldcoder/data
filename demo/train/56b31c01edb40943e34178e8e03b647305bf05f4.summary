-- @entity1 scored a late equalizer against @entity3 to deny @entity4 a victorious return to his old club on tuesday , while @entity7 moved towards a place in the @entity10 quarterfinals with victory at @entity12			1
@entity14 's @entity1 team are now unbeaten in seven encounters with @entity3 in @entity17 's top club competition			1
nine - time @entity19 champions real had lost in three previous visits to the @entity21 , and last season were knocked out of the competition at the last - 16 stage for the sixth year in a row after losing the first leg 1 - 0			1
but this time , with @entity10 - winning coach @entity29 at the helm , the @entity28 club have a better chance to end that poor run in next month 's home leg after striker @entity4 scored a vital away goal in @entity36			1
the 23 - year - old , who has struggled to win a regular place since his $ 50 million signing in 2009 , was named as a substitute despite netting in saturday 's @entity42 win over @entity43			1
but he made an instant impact after replacing on - loan @entity46 forward @entity45 in the 64th minute -- within 60 seconds he burst into the area and poked a low shot over the line despite a desperate attempt to clear by @entity51			0
" at home , in the first leg , we would have preferred them not to score , " @entity14 told reporters			0
" it 's a bit of a shame , especially because we played a great first half			0
" however , @entity1 captain @entity51 made a vital contribution to last season 's semifinalists ' 83rd - minute leveler when he rose highest to head a deflected free - kick into the path of @entity36 striker @entity65 , who calmly volleyed past goalkeeper @entity66			1
@entity65 made amends for a poor first - half miss , having blazed a shot over the crossbar with the goal at his mercy in the 34th minute			2
@entity3 will be left to rue two efforts that hit the woodwork five minutes after the break			2
first @entity76 smashed a free - kick against the far post following a booking to @entity1 midfielder @entity80 that ruled the @entity82 out of the match at the @entity84 on march 16			2
then defender @entity85 , who had just narrowly missed glancing in @entity76 's curled effort , headed against the crossbar from @entity89 's corner			0
" in the second half we managed to find spaces and , to begin with , we were closer to a second goal than @entity1 were to an equalizer , " @entity29 told reporters			0
" but it sets things up well for the second leg , where we will hope to qualify in front of our supporters			0
" @entity7 manager @entity101 dropped striker @entity102 for the trip to @entity104 , meaning $ 80 million signing @entity105 returned after being ineligible for the @entity108 defeat by @entity109 on saturday			2
but it was @entity36 forward @entity111 who stole the headlines with both goals in a 2 - 0 victory over @entity12 , who were playing for the first time since december 5 due to the @entity118 winter break			1
@entity111 broke the deadlock in the 17th minute with an opportunist effort after a loose pass by former @entity7 player @entity122 from near the halfway line gave the 31 - year - old space to surge forward and drill a low shot past goalkeeper @entity126			1
he was again on target nine minutes after the interval , firing his seventh goal of the competition this season from @entity133 's pass			0
he made way for @entity102 in the 74th minute , then almost immediately @entity105 had a shot cleared off the line as @entity7 went on to complete a first win since february 1 to lift some of the pressure on @entity101 ahead of the second leg at @entity139			2
@entity141 @entity140 winner @entity105 is still looking for his first goal since leaving @entity143 three weeks ago and endured another frustrating night			0
" he played very , very well , " the @entity144 said			0
" the key to this game was the work the strikers did , always dangerous			0
@entity105 was unlucky he did n't score , but had a fantastic game			0
" @entity7 's chances of qualifying for next season 's @entity10 were boosted on tuesday night when @entity154 rivals @entity153 suffered a 3 - 1 defeat at lowly @entity156 in the @entity157			1
@entity153 , who beat @entity159 in the @entity10 last week , would have gone third above @entity160 with victory but instead remained two points clear of fifth - placed @entity7 -- who now have a game in hand			1
@entity156 captain @entity166 , who almost joined @entity153 on the last day of the january transfer window , opened the scoring with an 18th - minute penalty and striker @entity170 continued his scoring run with the second goal just before halftime			2
substitute @entity174 made it 3 - 0 with 10 minutes to play , while @entity177 striker @entity176 scored a consolation in time added on with a deflected long - range effort as he started in place of @entity183 match - winner @entity182			1
the victory lifted @entity156 into 12th place , five points above the relegation zone			0
@entity7 's aspirations face a big test next tuesday at home to @entity157 leaders @entity192 , who have a 12 - point advantage over @entity101 's defending champions and can extend that at @entity196 on saturday .			1

@entity65 scores with seven minutes left to give @entity1 a 1 - 1 draw
@entity3 took the lead through former @entity1 striker @entity4
@entity111 scores both goals as @entity7 win 2 - 0 away to @entity12
@entity7 's hopes of qualifying next year boosted as @entity157 rivals @entity153 lose
