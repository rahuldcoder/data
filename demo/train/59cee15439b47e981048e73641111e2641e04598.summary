since last week 's @entity1 , some people have called for placing more surveillance cameras in @entity4 's cities			1
this would be a mistake			0
it would be dangerous to our civil liberties , and it would be bad policy			1
i felt last week 's tragic events personally -- as a parent of young children , a runner and a graduate of @entity17 in the @entity19 area			1
and it 's easy to see why those extraordinary images made us all more sensitive to the everyday possibility of danger			0
but the big picture is this : in a very unusual set of circumstances , two bad guys set off bombs			0
they killed three people , and injured many more			0
the people of @entity19 refused to be terrorized , and they worked with the police to catch those responsible in a few short days			1
even under these extraordinary circumstances , our system worked			1
bad people did bad things , but we found the suspects and we caught them			1
surveillance cameras of course played a part			1
they probably allowed the suspects to be identified more quickly , and they will surely provide useful evidence at the surviving suspect 's criminal trial			2
would more cameras have meant quicker apprehension of the suspects ? there 's no evidence to suggest this			1
and it 's important to remember that there are already lots of cameras in @entity19			1
and though some may believe that blanketing our public areas with video surveillance will make us safer , we should reject this call			2
first , surveillance cameras are expensive			2
they are costly to install and maintain , and in a time of limited budgets , they could be mistaken for an adequate substitute for human police officers on the street			2
should we trade off the cost of human police ( or schools , or roads , or lower taxes ) for even more robotic surveillance eyes ? i do n't think so			1
second , surveillance cameras do n't necessarily deter serious crimes			1
@entity19 's numerous cameras did n't stop the crime at the @entity79 , nor did @entity81 's more extensive network of cameras deter the 2005 subway bombings			1
@entity19 's talented police commissioner , @entity84 , put it best right after last monday 's events when he said that despite the city 's extensive security preparations , little short of a " police state " could have stopped the attacks			1
it is to @entity84 ' great credit that as police commissioner he did n't want a police state			2
this brings me to my third point			0
surveillance cameras , or other government surveillance technologies , have costs in civil liberties as well as in money			1
surveillance cameras like we already have in @entity19 are like having a police officer with perfect memory on every street corner			1
it might be relatively easy to say that even more video cameras would amplify that effect while posing little threat to privacy			0
but surveillance cameras are getting better , and it 's now possible to pair them with facial recognition technology linked to state driver 's license databases			1
when this technology matures , it 'll give the police the power to monitor all of our movements in public linked to our real identities , not just to our anonymous faces			0
such a system would conceivably give the government increased power over us , power that could be used not just to monitor , but in some cases , potentially , to blackmail , persuade or discriminate			0
police on every corner might be one thing , but police who can instantly see your identity papers and constantly track you are another			0
we might decide we want a limited version of this system , but we need to talk about these things now , before well - meaning local governments make the decision for us			0
it might be difficult to hear , but we ca n't be perfectly safe all the time			0
and part of living in a free and open society means that occasionally some people will abuse that freedom			2
that 's why we have a criminal justice system in which the police investigate crimes			1
it 's better to punish the people who abuse their freedom and harm others than to take everyone 's liberties away and subject us all to the eye of the state			1
less privacy , less civil liberties			0
being constantly observed might make us feel slightly safer , but this would be only an illusion of safety			0
history has shown repeatedly that broad government surveillance powers inevitably get abused , whether by the @entity169 , the @entity170 , or our own @entity171 , which engaged in unlawful surveillance ( and blackmail ) of " dangerous " people like @entity175 last week 's events gripped our attention because they were extraordinary			2
terror attacks , plane crashes , even school shootings stick in our head out of all proportion to the danger they pose to us as individual citizens precisely because they are extraordinary			0
but remember the big picture			0
how many people do you know who have been the victims of terrorism ? on the other hand , how many people do you know who have suffered from cancer , or obesity , or gun violence ? if we 're interested in safety , public health and gun control are much more important issues than terrorism			0
they , not surveillance , should be our safety priority			0
we should honor last week 's victims			0
we should praise the @entity207 , police and private citizens , who helped find the culprits			2
but we should also rest secure that our system of government is working			0
we should reject , like @entity84 did last week , any call to move further towards a police state .			2

@entity216 : after @entity19 terror attack , some call for more surveillance . that 's a bad idea
he says cameras helped @entity225 suspects , but it was the police system that worked
he says more cameras would be costly , could not stand in for humans
@entity232 : punish those who abuse freedom , hurt others ; do n't take liberties away
