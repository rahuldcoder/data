@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity4 it took years to weed out the details of systemic sexual abuse of children by catholic clergy			1
in @entity1 , prime minister @entity9 has put no time limit on what will be the most wide - ranging inquiry into child sex abuse in the nation 's history -- one that will not be confined to the @entity17			1
as she announced the establishment of a @entity19 into institutional responses to instances and allegations of child sex abuse , @entity9 said the inquiry would not target any one church but would encompass all religious institutions , state institutions , schools and not - for - profit groups like scouts and sports clubs			1
" there have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil , " she said			2
the evil of which she speaks is said by the mother of one victim to be endemic			2
@entity40 's son , @entity39 , is now 36 years old			1
" every morning he opens his eyes , he walks with that pain , " she told @entity2			2
@entity39 was an 11 - year - old altar boy at @entity44 in @entity45 in the @entity46 , north of @entity0 , when the abuse began at the hands of father @entity49 , who died in prison after being found guilty of child abuse -- including that of @entity39			1
the family were devout @entity17 when @entity49 was assigned to the parish and to the @entity40 family , who opened their home to him			1
soon after , the grooming began , and in time , the family says , so did the abuse			1
according to court evidence , throughout @entity39 's high school years @entity49 forced him into violent oral and anal sex , often in open spaces and always under threat			1
@entity49 would tell @entity39 their " special time " together should be kept secret lest @entity49 hurt one of @entity39 's brothers			1
the abuse ended when @entity39 was 17			1
seven years later he went to the police			1
though he was later contrite , the archbishop of the diocese tipped off the abuser , moving him to another parish , according to a police investigation			1
" i am ready and willing to help the @entity19 in any way i can , " @entity40 told @entity2			2
" and so is my courageous son			2
he was the first in the @entity78 who had to testify in court			0
my @entity39 had to go through the pain of the inquisition and the media and the reporting of the horrible details			0
" he knows he has played a part in this , and he knows i fought really hard for this @entity19 and for justice			0
he feels vindicated , " she added			0
@entity90 is not something the @entity19 can deliver @entity92 and @entity93 of @entity94			0
" our girls were assaulted at school by the local catholic priest , " @entity93 told @entity2			0
" they were five years old and up , raped multiple times over many years			0
it went on for several years -- we think about five years with @entity103 and with @entity104 probably about three or four years , " he said			0
when @entity103 was 14 , parish priest @entity105 , now deceased , was convicted of the sexual assault of 13 others			0
during his trial , testimony was offered that he had abused consistently from 1946 until he was brought before the courts			0
when @entity103 heard news of his conviction , she began to harm herself , the family says			0
" we saw her with blood pouring out of her wrists , " said @entity93 , " taking heroin to dull the pain			0
" when she was 26 , @entity103 killed herself			0
@entity104 's story is equally tragic			1
when she 14 , her parents found a suicide note she had written along with her diary in which she had detailed how @entity105 had abused her			0
the @entity124 were alarmed when they saw their daughter had begun to binge drink			0
a year later , just before her 16th birthday , tragedy struck			0
" she was at a friend 's house , " @entity93 told @entity2			1
" she was drunk , crossed the road and was hit by a car			0
she has severe brain injuries , " he said			0
" she has pre-accident memory			0
but she ca n't run her life			0
she has a five - minute window on life , " added @entity93			2
@entity104 and @entity142 's abuser is buried in the @entity17 crypt at @entity144			1
prime minister @entity9 insists the inquiry -- with the power to compel witnesses , offer indemnities and seize documents -- is not aimed at the @entity17			1
" this is a @entity19 which will be looking across religious organizations as well as state - based care and the not - for - profit sector			2
it is not targeted at any one section or religion , " she said			0
however , the only religious leader @entity9 consulted after she decided on the @entity19 was the @entity159 archbishop , cardinal @entity158			1
a divisive figure , @entity158 defended himself and his church against claims last week of systemic cover - ups by the church hierarchy			1
as calls for a national inquiry grew louder in the wake of explosive claims by a senior police officer that the church was complicit in the crimes by moving offending priests and destroying crucial evidence to stymie prosecutions , @entity158 said the @entity17 was being disproportionately targeted			1
" we have to answer up for what we 've done , " @entity158 told his congregation on the weekend			0
" but any suggestion that we are the only culprit or only community producing culprits is entirely misleading , " he preached			0
" this is really an inquiry into the @entity17 and the cover - up , " @entity93 told @entity2			1
" it 's all the revelations of abuse in the church that brought this to a head			1
we know there is other sexual abuse , but this has come about because of rampant sexual abuse by @entity17 clergy , " he said			1
for @entity40 and her son @entity39 , the @entity19 is most certainly about the sins of the @entity17 and what he sees as the lack of compassion shown to its victims			1
" we went through the whole trial with no support from the church , " she told @entity2			2
" the priests supported @entity49 , to see how he was , to pray with him			2
we were in the same courthouse , and no one came near us			0
the church community were not encouraged to be mindful of the victim			2
there were prayers for the priests and not for the victim			2
that 's not fair , " she said			2
as for the police officer who blew the whistle on both fellow officers and the church for covering up the abuse , the announcement represents an opportunity			1
" now we 're going to start listening to the victims and start listening to their families , " said detective chief inspector @entity224			0
" and we 're going to start doing something about the problem			0
the big problem is denial , when you 're not prepared to sit down and actually start to acknowledge that there 's a problem and look at ways of fixing it , " he said			2
@entity9 said her government will consult with victims ' support groups , religious organizations and state and territory governments to determine the @entity19 's terms of reference .			1
