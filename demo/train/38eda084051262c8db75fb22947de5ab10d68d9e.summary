@entity1 football officials were left red - faced on tuesday after their @entity3 qualifier against @entity4 was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch -- despite @entity7 's national stadium boasting a retractable roof			1
a heavy downpour started more than four hours before the match but the roof on the stadium was never closed , so allowing the pitch to become unplayable			0
" it 's up to the people whose responsibility it is to run the stadium for them to decide when the roof needs to be on , or if it needs to be on , " @entity4 manager @entity13 said			2
" no one will be more disappointed than them that the roof had n't gone on and the pitch was playable			0
" world governing body @entity22 delayed kick - off to see if conditions improved but the referee called the game off 45 minutes after it should have started , rescheduling the match for wednesday afternoon			0
the 58,000 - capacity stadium was specifically built for the 2012 @entity29 , at a cost of nearly $ 650 million , which @entity31 co-hosted in june along with neighbors @entity33			2
@entity1 organizers later stated that they were unable to take a unilateral decision to open or close a roof since they needed clearance from @entity22 to do so			0
" it takes 15 minutes to close the roof			0
however , this can not happen in a temperature below zero , with very strong wind , and rain deposited on the folded roof , " added @entity41 , a spokeswoman for the stadium operator			0
it was a mixed night for @entity4 , whose under - 21 side qualified for next year 's @entity29 when beating @entity51 in a game in @entity53 that ended with ugly scenes and the visitors reporting " a number of incidents of racism " to @entity57 governing body @entity56			2
" the @entity61 condemns both the scenes of racism and the confrontation at the final whistle during which time our players and staff were under extreme provocation , " said the @entity61 in a statement			0
among the @entity3 qualifiers that were played on tuesday , @entity71 were held 4 - 4 at home by @entity74 despite leading by four goals with an hour gone			1
a brace from @entity77 had helped @entity71 assume a seemingly unassailable lead in @entity79 only for @entity74 to take advantage of an uncharacteristic lack of @entity83 resilience , as @entity84 dramatically earned a point deep in the 93rd minute			2
another team to be denied in the last minute were @entity87 , whose remarkable run of 24 consecutive wins in qualifying games -- which stretched back to 2007 -- was ended when drawing 1 - 1 at home to @entity94 winners @entity95 in @entity96			1
@entity97 gave the world and @entity57 champions an early lead which @entity101 failed to double when his first - half penalty was saved -- leaving the visitors to earn a deserved point when @entity105 headed home deep in stoppage time			0
elsewhere , an historic night for @entity108 -- who was winning his 100th cap for @entity110 -- was upstaged by visitors @entity111 , who led for large parts of the game in @entity116 before @entity117 earned a 1 - 1 draw just ten minutes from time			1
@entity108 had started the night in high spirits as he was presented with a special cap to mark the occasion but after the match , the @entity96 star left the pitch in pouring rain sporting a face like thunder			1
in other games , @entity129 needed a fortuitous 84th minute penalty to defeat @entity132 1 - 0 in @entity133 , @entity128 continued their impressive form when beating @entity135 2 - 0 at home while @entity137 made light of losing @entity139 to a red card after 46 minutes as they won 3 - 1 in @entity141 against @entity142			1
in @entity145 , @entity143 -- who finished third at the @entity3 two years ago -- were humbled in @entity146 where @entity147 won 4 - 1 , with @entity148 scoring a consolation goal for the visitors late on .			1

@entity31 's home tie with @entity4 delayed 24 hours by waterlogged pitch
@entity71 let slip a four - goal lead at home as @entity74 net late on to claim dramatic 4 - 4 draw
@entity87 's remarkable run of 24 successive qualifying wins ends when held by @entity95 in @entity96
@entity108 's 100th cap *overshadowed* as @entity110 salvage 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity111
