@entity0 -- some foreign students who enroll and graduate from @entity5 flight schools are in the @entity5 illegally , despite extensive post- 9/11 efforts to vet student pilots , congressional investigators said wednesday			1
@entity9 , an investigative chief with the @entity10 , declined to say how many student pilots he found to be wrongly in the country , saying that the @entity13 had deemed the number to be " sensitive security information			1
" but , he said , his study showed " weaknesses " in the @entity13 's vetting process that need to be fixed			1
the holes are " extremely disturbing , " @entity20 chairman rep. @entity19 said			0
" it 's completely unacceptable that a decade after 9/11 @entity10 has uncovered weaknesses in our security controls that were supposed to be fixed a decade ago , " @entity19 said			1
several of the terrorists who carried out the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , including leader @entity28 , trained at @entity5 flight schools before conducting their attack , and government leaders vowed to prevent such a mistake from happening again			2
for illegal immigrant graduates , a ' leap of faith ' answered today , the @entity13 vets foreign student pilots against terror watch lists and conducts fingerprint - based criminal background checks , but it does not vet them against immigration databases , the @entity10 lead investigator said			1
@entity9 said his group downloaded an @entity42 database of pilots and compared it to @entity13 's database of student pilots who had completed background checks			1
" in a perfect world , the two databases would match , " @entity9 said			2
" but we were surprised to find that some ... of the foreign nationals holding pilots ' licenses were not in the @entity13 's databases , indicating that some foreign nationals had not been vetted before receiving flight training , and ultimately receiving pilots ' licenses			1
" the hole first came to public light in 2010 when local police stopped the owner of a @entity63 flight school for a traffic violation and discovered he was in the country illegally			0
federal immigration officials investigated and found that 25 of the foreign nationals at the school had been vetted by the @entity13 and had been approved to begin flight training			2
but further investigation revealed that eight of the students had entered the country illegally and 17 had overstayed their visas			0
@entity75 , the @entity13 's general manager for general aviation , said the @entity13 is taking steps to address the matter			1
" we do have a plan in place			0
we 're working very closely with @entity82 ( @entity82 ) in terms of automating the process to ensure that @entity13 is also checking for immigration status as well as the @entity86 , " he said			2
rep. @entity87 , @entity88 , said the government needs a " common - sense solution " to prevent another 9/11 - style attack , but said no solution would be perfect			0
" we will never have 100 percent security			0
that just wo n't happen			0
somebody that is perfectly normal one day can flip , because of whatever pressures he or she is under , " he said .			0
