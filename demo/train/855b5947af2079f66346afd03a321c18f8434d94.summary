@entity0 -- president @entity2 signed legislation on wednesday aimed at restoring @entity5 ' faith in the nation 's public institutions at a time they rank at record lows in opinion polls			1
the act bans insider trading by members of @entity14 and many executive branch employees			0
in a ceremony at the @entity17 , the president referred to the need to address public skepticism about an uneven system			1
" the powerful should n't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else , " @entity2 said			1
" if we expect that to apply to our biggest corporations and to our most successful citizens , it certainly applies to our elected officials , especially at a time when there is a deficit of trust between this city and the rest of the country			0
" the @entity38 -- the @entity38 -- is a rare bipartisan measure coming out of a deeply divided @entity14			0
it makes it clear that members of @entity14 , their aides and many members of the executive branch can not use inside information they learn on the job to trade stocks or other securities			1
the law makes such practices criminal and requires public disclosure of any trades within 45 days			1
it also requires those reports to be made available online in a database that members of the public can search			2
the new law also limits members of @entity14 and executive employees to participating only in those initial public stock offerings that are available to the general public			2
but many public interest groups call the final version weak , because it omitted a provision in the @entity68 version that would have regulated " political intelligence , " the practice of gathering information from lawmakers and @entity74 aides that could be used to make investment decisions			1
@entity2 pledged to work on additional reforms that would " limit the corrosive influence of money in politics			1
" he suggested that elected officials should not own stock in industries they can affect in their positions , and those who bundle campaign contributions should be banned from lobbying @entity14			0
although @entity89 @entity88 rep. @entity87 introduced the legislation six years ago , it did n't have many supporters or much traction on @entity93 until a story that aired on @entity96 's " @entity95 " in november			1
the report raised questions about whether the access several high - profile members of @entity14 had to inside information on legislation helped them profit from financial transactions involving companies that were affected			1
after the report , both @entity17 and @entity68 leaders , mindful of the low public regard for @entity14 , fast - tracked the measure			2
originally , the bill 's restrictions applied just to members of @entity14 and their staffs , but @entity114 expanded it to cover many executive agency employees			2
despite the overwhelming vote in favor of the bill in both the @entity17 and the @entity68 , none of the top @entity119 leaders attended the @entity17 bill signing ceremony on wednesday			1
@entity17 majority leader @entity124 , who worked on the final version that was enacted , was invited but had events already scheduled in his @entity129 , @entity128 , district			0
@entity132 @entity131 sen. @entity131 , facing a tough re-election race this fall , was the lone @entity68 @entity114 to stand on the stage with @entity2 as he wielded several pens to enact the new law			1
@entity137 of @entity138 , @entity139 of @entity140 and @entity141 of @entity142 -- all representing districts @entity88 are targeting in november -- also attended			0
the president praised @entity87 for championing the bill , but noted she could n't witness the signing in person because she had broken her leg			2
@entity150 @entity149 , whose financial transactions were examined in the " @entity95 " story , did not attend			1
her office said she had commitments in @entity89 on wednesday morning and did not return to @entity0 in time			0
another subject of the @entity96 investigation was @entity158 rep. @entity157 , the chairman of the @entity159			0
his office put out a release saying he will attend a bill signing on thursday on jobs legislation , but he was not among the @entity114 who attended the @entity38 signing			2
@entity124 said the bill was evidence that a divided @entity14 could work together on other issues			2
" rather than letting our differences divide us , as so often happens in @entity0 , this bipartisan bill shows that we can come together and deliver results for the @entity5 people , " @entity124 said in a written statement			0
the @entity174 , a nonpartisan , nonprofit group that pushes for greater transparency in government , said that while the final measure omitted some stronger provisions it believed would crack down on insider trading , it was an important step forward			0
but the group 's policy director , @entity181 , maintained there were plenty of other abuses involving improper behavior by officeholders that had yet to be exposed			0
" the stock act was just one vehicle for ethics and transparency reform in @entity14 , and a response to a particularly objectionable idea -- representatives seeking to make a private profit through their public service			0
there are 20 more @entity199 © s like the @entity96 story just waiting to happen , " @entity181 wrote wednesday			0
the spotlight on @entity14 ' recent string of bipartisan action continues thursday , when @entity2 is scheduled to sign a bill making it easier for small businesses to gain access to capital and make public offerings			1
@entity1 @entity17 producer @entity210 contributed to this report			0

in signing ceremony , @entity2 talks of need to address public skepticism
@entity217 makes it *illegal* to use inside information to trade stocks and securities
public interest groups say the bill was weakened before it was passed
issue came to light after " @entity95 " story on some profiting from inside information
