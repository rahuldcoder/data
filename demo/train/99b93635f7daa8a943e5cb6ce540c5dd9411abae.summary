-- the ouster of @entity3 's longtime ruler has cast a shadow over the surrounding region , but few analysts were willing to predict tuesday that the revolt would spread to other countries			1
@entity10 @entity9 was @entity3 's president for 23 years before friday , when weeks of protests forced him into exile in @entity13			1
tunisians complained that the president 's family and supporters had grown rich while their living conditions stagnated and their voices were stifled			2
but while the governments of nearby nations like @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 face similar criticism , the level of repression and the concentration of power and corruption were far more extreme in @entity3 , said @entity31 , a professor of @entity33 politics at @entity34 in @entity35			1
" i think most regimes in the region are viewed with a mix of disdain and resignation by their population , " @entity31 said			2
few may support their government , but " it 's not as if there 's much that can be done about it , " he said			0
neighboring @entity27 was also wracked by rioting last week , triggered by the spiraling costs of basic food items after its government slashed price supports for staples like milk , oil and sugar			0
state - run media reported at least three people had died in the clashes			0
@entity28 's longtime strongman , @entity60 , mourned @entity9 's ouster and warned in a nationally televised speech that @entity3 was facing " unjustified chaos			1
" and in @entity29 , at least two people have set themselves afire in public this week -- the same type of protest that triggered @entity3 's demonstrations in december			1
@entity29 president @entity69 , one of the top @entity71 allies in the region , has ruled his country since 1981			1
tuesday , the @entity74 tried to tamp down speculation that his government faced anything like the uprising that forced @entity9 from power			2
" what happened in @entity3 can not easily be repeated in any other country , " @entity80 , a foreign ministry spokesman , said tuesday			1
" every nation has its specific circumstances and every nation has its political , economic and social situation			0
it is very hard to compare between the situation which existed in @entity3 and led to the latest reaction by the people there ( to ) any other country , @entity94 or not			1
" and though other @entity96 states are dominated by authoritarian governments and plagued by poverty and corruption , a @entity3 - style uprising " would play out much differently " elsewhere , @entity31 said			1
the well - entrenched police state established under @entity9 left @entity3 with few alternatives to his ruling @entity103 , he said			1
" in other countries , there are much more well - organized political forces that would step in , " he said			0
but @entity107 , an analyst at @entity108 in @entity109 , warned that discontent is " bubbling over continuously " in the region			1
the @entity71 , meanwhile , counts many of those governments as partners in its battle against @entity115 and its allies			1
" it 's not in our interest to try to keep this lid down artificially , because ultimately the explosion will be even worse later on than it would be in the short term , " @entity107 said			0
leaked @entity71 diplomatic cables released since november by the website @entity124 painted a scathing view of @entity3 's now - ousted leader and his associates			1
one described @entity9 's extended family as a " quasi-mafia " that pushed for a taste of any venture they saw			0
their assessments of some other countries in the region are less critical , but still jaundiced			2
@entity27 's government " is fragile in ways it has not been before , plagued by a lack of vision , unprecedented levels of corruption and rumblings of division within the military rank and file , " a december 2007 cable from the @entity140 in @entity141 states			2
the country 's weak economy " has @entity27 , especially youth , feeling gloomy and grim about the fate of their country as it drifts into the new year			0
" " we do not sense an explosion coming right away			0
instead , we see a government drifting and groping for a way forward , " the cable states			0
in @entity28 , meanwhile , @entity60 -- a military officer who seized power in 1969 -- has promised sweeping economic and political reforms since 2006			2
but international observers say that push has stalled despite the elevation of his son , @entity170 -- once a leading reform advocate -- to a top position in the government , and the @entity60 family has " strong interests " in @entity28 's oil and gas sector and numerous other interests in the country , according to a 2006 cable disclosed by @entity124			0
but unlike @entity9 's family , the @entity180 avoid extravagant displays of wealth at home , the @entity71 cable described			1
" compared to egregious pillaging of state coffers elsewhere in @entity187 , or the lavish spending of @entity189 , the @entity28 do n't see much to complain about in their leader 's lifestyle , as long as he does a good job of making sure other people get a piece of the pie , " the cable states			0
" and when @entity28 do complain , they are removed from access to financial rewards			0
" @entity31 said the events in @entity3 are unlikely to yield a rerun of 1989 , when communist regimes across @entity203 imploded before a string of popular uprisings			2
" i would say we 're dealing with 1975 , " he said			0
" we 've got kind of tired regimes that have just lost their ideological sense of direction , they 've lost popular support -- but they 're just there , and they do n't look like they 're going anywhere			0
