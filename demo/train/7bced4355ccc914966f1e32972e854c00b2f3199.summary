@entity0 who flashes his @entity14 * * ker wallet			1
they did n't come here to ogle the impersonators on @entity18			1
nor did they come to snatch up tickets to meet @entity22 's wax figures			1
and they certainly did n't arrive to hop on the @entity25 bus			1
no , they take their seats on a cement wall around the corner , in front of @entity32 's @entity31 , where they wait in anticipation for something bigger			2
" i 'd like to see the toilet where @entity39 got busted " for a lewd act with an undercover cop , says an @entity36			2
" @entity44 , i 'll be happy with , " says the @entity36 's partner , his camera at the ready			2
" we 'd like to see @entity47 drunk , facedown somewhere			2
that would be awesome , " a woman gushes , her friend nodding beside her			2
welcome to the @entity51 , where for the special reduced price of $ 49 , an adult can board a bus and take a two - hour unashamed dip into the celebrity gossip sleaze pool			1
children are welcome to dive in for $ 39			2
" we were going to do the movie stars ' homes , but that seemed so boring , " says @entity59 , 33 , of @entity60 , @entity36 , who flew into @entity0 just hours earlier and rushed here , jet lag be damned			2
" this was the newest , hippest thing to do			2
" @entity70 by the ticket taker , the assembled crowd moves toward the bus			2
" you guys excited ? " yells the escort , who leads the way through a maze of corridors			2
first they let out a collective scream , and then the fist - pumping chants begin : " @entity81 ! @entity82 ! @entity83 ! " there 's nowhere @entity85 of @entity86 , @entity87 , would rather be			1
" our main source of news is @entity83 , " boasts @entity85 , who 's come here to celebrate her 47th birthday			2
on this tour in late august , a couple dozen enthusiasts file onto the open - sided @entity83 - emblazoned bus			1
a young girl , too innocent to know about sex tapes , bounces on board , her @entity83 stocking cap slightly askew			2
nabbing a spot in the front row is a @entity101 sporting a made - for - the - occasion black t - shirt that reads , " i 'm a lawyer ! " -- the sign - off for @entity105 's " @entity83 on tv " gossip news show			1
@entity108 , an actor who 'd rather keep his age to himself , takes a seat facing the excited crowd			0
" we do n't have culture in @entity0 , " he announces , sliding into his tour guide role			0
" we have the @entity115 ! " he promises to show the group where celebrities eat , party and " buy their kids really creepy - ass dolls			1
" what he delivers over the next couple of hours is so much more than dining and drinking destinations , and tips on where to buy " creepy - ass dolls " ( that would be @entity130 , at the @entity131 , for those who are wondering )			1
we drive along famous streets , including @entity133 , all the while scouring the landscape for real - life stars			1
celebrities have been known to hop on the bus for a quick visit -- or so says our guide			0
we pass the @entity142 , " where @entity144 would allegedly sneak through the laundry room to hook up with @entity6 , " says the announcer on a mounted tv			0
we cruise down @entity18 , " where celebrities pay $ 30,000 to have their own stars so homeless people can pee on them , " our guide says			0
we turn onto @entity133 and see the fast - food joint @entity151 , where @entity153 got his @entity18 start dressed as a chicken			1
the journey is a deluge of must - know smut that washes over tourists , taking with it the worries of the world			1
@entity164 troops abroad ? @entity165 ? the struggling economy ? pshaw			0
there are strip clubs to uncover , including the @entity169 , where @entity108 says @entity170 shot its " @entity172 " video			1
later we find the @entity174 , where our trusted guide tells us actress @entity176 " got down with a stripper named @entity178			0
" we see where @entity179 picked up prostitute @entity180 for $ 60 ( and got busted ) and are treated to their mug shots on the tv screen			1
oh , and there 's the liquor store , @entity186 's , where @entity187 smashed her car			1
we watch footage of stumbling , drunken stars and later revisit an old surveillance tape of @entity194 shoplifting			0
we play tv - prompted games , including " @entity196 ? " in today 's episode , video captures @entity199 at a restaurant			1
he stares at the camera , and the tape pauses			0
finger or wave ? the tour bus contestant screams , " wave ! " @entity204 , ding , ding ! throw that tourist a t - shirt ! we pass @entity208 , where @entity210 's @entity209 was auctioned off for $ 230,000 , and the @entity211 , where comedian @entity212 went off on a racist rant and his career crumbled			1
we gawk at @entity215 , where @entity216 gave birth , where @entity218 and @entity219 died , and where @entity220 took an involuntary spin through the psych ward			0
we peer up at the high - rise @entity223 and learn from our all - knowing @entity83 guide that resident @entity225 shelled out $ 3 million for an additional condo ... just for his baby ! " you want to hear something really depressing ? " @entity108 calls out at one point			1
" @entity232 ! ( @entity233 ) that 's all			0
" there are reminders of overdoses : the @entity237 , where @entity238 died , the @entity239 , where @entity241 's life ended			1
it was from the storied @entity239 ( where the tour 's birthday girl plans to go next for lunch ) that actor @entity246 called 911 to -- brace yourself -- complain about his diarrhea			0
so that no one forgets this moment in history , the tour bus tv shares the call			0
" what 's he doing calling the fire department ? " the tour guide asks			0
" eat a cracker ! " even though we wo n't make a pilgrimage to where another historical shift occurred , we are reminded of february 16 , 2007 -- called " one of the most shocking days " -- when @entity220 shaved her head			0
later we 'll cruise by @entity266 , where our trusted news source says she bought her hot pink wig and where @entity270 and @entity271 apparently like to shop			0
there 's @entity275 , where @entity276 allegedly left a $ 100 tip after ordering a milkshake , and @entity280 , where it 's said @entity281 maintains her hue			0
further on in the tour , we pass where the world got to really know @entity286 : the @entity287 , where @entity108 says she and @entity290 filmed " the most lucrative sex tape of all time ! " the little girl who boarded in the stocking cap is slumped in her seat , hat off , looking not only unfazed but bored			0
the education on how we can be like the stars goes on			0
for $ 400 , our guide says , you can get a haircut at @entity302			0
@entity303 out $ 1,500 for a reservation , and you can walk into @entity306 on @entity307			0
or , at a bargain of $ 30 , you can enjoy a salad at the @entity310			0
and if you 're a man looking to prove that you 're fine after a high - profile breakup , you can snag a window seat at the @entity313 and surround yourself with laughing , flirtatious women -- just like @entity108 says @entity315 did			1
we marvel at the famous @entity18 sign up in the hills			1
we whip out our cameras to capture the iconic @entity320 sign , too			0
we take comfort knowing the fire hydrants in @entity320 are painted platinum and that the @entity324 has a five - star rating on @entity326			1
and all around us , as passers - by honk and scream -- " @entity81 ! " -- we know we are not alone			1
on this day in late august , as victims of @entity331 struggle through floodwaters , world leaders wring their hands over @entity335 and @entity164 troops look back on their deadliest month in @entity336 , the @entity51 offers a different reality , an unapologetic escape			0
with or without a facedown @entity47 or @entity39 's toilet .			0
