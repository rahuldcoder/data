-- just when i thought my amazement with @entity4 had run its course , he did it again			1
in a long interview with an old friend who was writing for an @entity11 magazine , the pope put forward a 10 - point plan for happiness			1
from where i sit , it seems , well , pretty damn good if not perfect			2
here are pope @entity4 ' tips for a happy life and my comments on them : 1			1
it 's an echo of the @entity4 's earlier remark on gays : " who am i to judge ? " moreover , it 's what @entity23 said in the @entity25 : " judge not , unless you want to be judged yourself			1
" ( @entity27 ) 2			2
that is , give your money and your time to those in need			2
do n't just sit around like stagnant water			2
give all you have and then some			2
3 move quietly in the world			1
the @entity4 quotes from a favorite novel by an early 20th - century @entity11 writer , @entity36 , in which the novelist writes that in one 's youth , a person is " a rocky stream that runs over everything , " but as one gets older , one becomes " a running river , quietly peaceful			1
" it 's very like the @entity48 suggestion that one should walk " in balance and beauty " on the ground , making the least disturbance			2
the @entity4 says that consumerism has brought with it unbearable anxieties			1
so play with your children			2
and do n't spend all your time thinking about your next acquisition			2
spend your time well , not your money			2
this is actually one of the @entity63			2
( @entity65 ) once a week , give a whole day to meditation , worship , family life , tending the needs of the spirit			1
find jobs for young people			2
who would have guessed that job - creation would be on list for happiness ? but the @entity4 is right			1
honest , simple work for young people is essential to their well - being			1
somewhat surprisingly , in this moment in the interview , the @entity4 connected job creation to the degradation of our environment : " the tyrannical use of nature			1
" he links the lack of good jobs to the lack of respect for ourselves and the @entity93 itself			2
so creating jobs does n't mean ruining the environment			0
it does n't mean , as the politicians chant , " jobs , jobs , jobs			0
" good and productive labor is valuable , and it does n't mean you have to have a fancy job description			0
you do n't have to become rich			0
do good work , create good work for others			1
this follows from no. 6			0
" is n't humanity committing suicide with this indiscriminate and tyrannical use of nature ? " the @entity4 wonders			1
not surprisingly , this is what @entity117 , a founding father of the environmental movement , said			0
" most people live lives of quiet desperation , " he said			1
he went into the woods , to @entity124 , because he wanted " to live deliberately " and to " front only the essential facts of life			1
" a proper respect for nature means that you ca n't pollute the air , poison the rivers and chop down the forests indiscriminately without suffering greatly			0
i suspect that a huge amount of the anxiety and suffering that we see around can be closely traced to our wanton misuse of our resources			0
just look at any garbage dump and see what is wasted			0
in a sense , we 've wasted our souls			0
let go of negative things quickly			0
the @entity4 tells us not to complain about people who annoy or frustrate us , to let go of things as rapidly as we can			1
i have an old friend who used to say , " put the bad things in your back pocket and leave them there			0
" this may sound like escapism or putting your head in the sand , but it 's more interesting than that			0
life throws rotten things our way each day			0
people say nasty things to us , often about others			0
this stuff makes them miserable , of course			0
it makes us miserable , too			0
do n't preach your religion too forcefully			0
@entity171 brings on paralysis , the @entity4 tells us			1
i 'm a @entity174 myself , and i do n't mind saying so			0
but each person sees the world before them in his or her own way			1
as a teaching , it seems to run counter to the so - called @entity183 ( @entity27 28:16 - 20 )			1
@entity23 said to get out there and spread the word			0
but the @entity4 takes a relaxed view of this activity , preferring that we should teach by example			1
perhaps that really is what @entity23 would do ? 10			1
the @entity4 has preached this message from the beginning of his time as pontiff			1
he has gone to @entity197 and worked to bring together @entity198 and @entity199			0
he has prayed for peace and worked for peace			1
he has listened closely to @entity23 , who said , " blessed are the peacemakers			0
" the @entity4 asks us to take in refugees , to think innovatively about how to create peace in the world			1
@entity23 , of course , invites us to turn the other cheek when struck			0
this is a complex teaching			0
but it 's essential to @entity174 faith			0
the @entity4 , once again , calls on us to take the teachings of the @entity25 seriously			1
this is very hard but crucial work			0
pope @entity4 has , in this unlikely venue , given us his own @entity25 , his @entity63 for happiness and inner peace			1
one can only be grateful for his wisdom , which is rooted in a sincere faith , in hard - earned wisdom , and a very practical knowledge of human needs and potentials .			2

in an interview , @entity4 laid out 10 - point plan for happiness
among them : live and let live ; move quietly in world ; sunday is for family ; enjoy leisure
one that surprises @entity237 is not to *proselytize*
@entity237 says the @entity4 urges us to think innovatively about how to create peace
