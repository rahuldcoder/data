-- @entity1 suffered a shock defeat in the second round at @entity4 wednesday after being beaten by @entity6 qualifier @entity5			1
third seed @entity1 , who won the tournament in 2004 , was brushed aside 6 - 3 6 - 4 by a player ranked 131 in the world			1
the @entity11 appeared to be unhappy with the conditions of the grass court and fell during the second set and appeared to tell the umpire that " this court is dangerous			2
" but after receiving treatment for her fall , she was unable to stave off one of the biggest @entity4 upsets in recent years			1
" i just tried to stay calm , " @entity5 told the @entity21			1
" i was playing so well i thought i could keep it up and i just hung in there			2
she 's a fighter , she just would n't give up for anything			2
" there 's lot of grass that 's been cut and not been swept up so there 's a lot of dead grass so it 's not been easy			2
it 's a tough court to play on			2
" @entity1 slipped and fell on @entity33 on a couple of occasions and needed a time out to receive treatment to her left hip after the eighth game of the second set			1
" it was a combination of everything , " @entity41 told the @entity21			2
" i give her a lot of credit , she played extremely well today , really solid from the baseline , i do n't think i was aggressive enough			2
i just was n't there			0
" when asked about the slippery nature of the court and her comment about the surface being dangerous , she added : " i do n't think i 've ever fallen three times in a match before in my career , so that was a little strange			0
" well , after i buckled my knee three times , that 's obviously my first reaction			0
" @entity1 also believes that players should be entitled to practice on the main courts in order to prepare for the tournament			1
she added : " the first few days , you just know that they 're going to just be really different			0
" the victory is @entity68 's greatest yet with this win representing the first time she has beaten a player ranked inside the top five			1
the 20 - year - old , who will play @entity75 of @entity76 for a place in the last 16 , has never progressed past the third round of a grand slam			1
@entity68 courted controversy in 2009 when she was criticized for her fierce shrieking and her form suffered as a result following mocking by fans			1
but encouraged by her father , @entity85 , who also doubles up as her @entity68 's coach , she bounced back with the love and help of her family			1
" if you lose enough times , you think , what am i doing ? that 's where my family stepped in and helped me get pumped up , " she said			0
" i 've been working extra hard in these practices , giving 120 % in practices			0
my dad really pushed me a lot			0
" when i was 16 i was in the top 100 and everybody was comparing me to @entity101 , expecting me to win a @entity102 at that age			0
" but that does n't happen anymore , winning @entity102 so young			0
tennis is so competitive now and so hard , it 's hard to stay there			0
" i ca n't say enough good things about my father because he helped me a lot			0
it 's easy to lose motivation			0
but with these wins , it 's definitely going to help			0
" elsewhere , ninth seed @entity115 crashed out following a 6 - 2 6 - 2 defeat by @entity119 @entity118 , while former @entity120 was beaten by 2012 junior champion @entity121			1
the @entity122 prevailed 6 - 3 6 - 3 on @entity123 and will play @entity125 's @entity124 in the next round			1
@entity127 is through to the third round where she will play @entity119 @entity129			1
@entity127 , 19 , built on her first round win over fifth seed @entity131 by defeating @entity133 of @entity125 6 - 2 5 - 7 6 - 4			1
@entity135 star @entity134 defeated @entity136 of @entity137 in three sets , winning 8 - 6 in the decider .			0
