@entity11 , who was detained with her @entity10 husband , @entity13 , and their two children at an airport in @entity17 on tuesday , is accused of traveling with falsified documents and giving false information , according to her legal team			1
the family is currently being held in a @entity17 police station and has been refused bail			0
@entity24 's legal team told @entity0 that @entity13 is being held as an accessory			0
the family was stopped at the airport after what @entity24 's lawyers described tuesday as an alleged " irregularity with her documentation			2
" @entity24 has a @entity10 visa and was headed to the @entity10 with her family , her legal team said			2
the @entity35 said tuesday that @entity24 and her family had been " temporarily detained at the airport " for questioning over issues relating to their travel and documentation			0

the government has assured us of their safety , " @entity35 spokeswoman @entity41 said then			0
@entity41 said that the @entity10 embassy " has been and will remain highly involved in working with the family and the government , " saying " we are engaging directly with @entity5 officials to secure their safe and swift departure from @entity5			2
" @entity5 authorities said @entity24 had been detained because of the documents she submitted			1
@entity5 's @entity53 and @entity54 said that she had @entity5 travel documents , despite not being a citizen of @entity5 , and she was heading to the @entity10 , which is not her native country			1
" this was considered illegal by the @entity5 authorities , who have summoned both the @entity10 and @entity5 ambassadors , " the agency said in a message posted on its media @entity61 early wednesday			1
the airport detention came a day after @entity24 's legal team announced the 27 - year - old woman had been released from prison after weeks of international controversy over her conviction on apostasy and adultery charges			1
according to her lawyer , the case began when one of @entity24 's relatives , a @entity79 , filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married @entity13 , a @entity4 , after she was missing for several years			0
the @entity5 court considered @entity79 because her father was @entity79 , but she said she was a @entity4 and never practiced @entity84			0
she was charged with adultery , because a @entity79 woman 's marriage to a @entity4 man is illegal in @entity5 , and with apostasy , accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith .			2
