-- @entity2 captain @entity1 has upped the stakes ahead of september 's @entity4 with a stinging attack on his @entity7 team counterpart @entity6			1
@entity6 , left , and @entity1 will continue their rivalry at the @entity4 in september			1
@entity6 's stewardship ahead of @entity7 's bid for victory at @entity13 in @entity14 has already been criticized following his admonishment of @entity16 for his behavior at last season 's @entity19 match in @entity21			1
and now @entity1 , who has had a rocky relationship with @entity6 both as a player and television commentator , has weighed in by claiming that the @entity25 is not popular with his players			1
" @entity6 has tried to redefine himself , " the @entity2 told @entity27 's @entity29 newspaper			1
" i 'd say he is both who he is and who he was			0
" some people have bought it			0
but if you 're going to be a p * * * k and everyone hates you , why do you think that just because you 're trying to be cute and funny on air now that the same people are all going to start to like you ? " the bottom line is that the players from his generation and mine really do n't want to have anything to do with him			2
he did what he did as a player and there are consequences			0
" @entity6 , the record points scorer in @entity4 history , was renowned for his single - minded approach as a player -- which won him six major titles but few friends on the course			1
his first run - in with @entity1 came in 1987			1
after winning his first @entity63 at @entity64 , @entity6 reportedly commented " tough luck , old boy " after the @entity2 bogeyed the last two holes on the final day to miss out on the title			1
they famously halved a @entity4 match six years later at @entity71			2
" he talked me into giving him a five - footer on the 16th , " @entity1 told the mail on sunday			2
" he said , ' it 's over			0
you guys have won '			0
so i waived the putt			0
then @entity77 ran over and told me the match was still tied			0
i ca n't tell you how irritating that was			0
" then , on the 18th , when @entity2 had already won , i needed a 10 - footer to win the hole and halve the match			1
who gave a rat 's ass about our match because the result of the @entity4 was already decided ? " i went through the motions of preparing for the putt expecting any second for him to tell me to pick the ball up			1
it would have been the sporting thing to have done and i could n't believe it when he said nothing			0
i holed it , and that gave me so much pleasure			0
" i guess i 've always felt a rivalry with him , probably more than he has with me			0
i 've got to know him better now but it does n't change what 's happened and , come september at @entity13 , something will have to give			0
" @entity6 and @entity16 used to be @entity4 partners , but the @entity108 now seems likely to miss out after slipping down the world rankings			1
" i hope he plays against us , but i 'm worried he wo n't , " @entity1 told the @entity29			2
" he and @entity6 do n't seem to get along and there 's no way @entity6 will award him one of his two wild - cards			1
we 're all scared of him when he plays in the @entity4			2
" what he 's done is amazing			0
@entity118 's become famous for it in the @entity2 and he 's never even won a major			1
@entity2 do n't particularly like him but there 's nothing wrong in being the villain			1
" he 's brought a lot of it on himself , of course			0
he probably wo n't ever win a major now , but i still want him in the @entity7 team because i want to show him what the taste of defeat is like			2
i 've told him this			0
i also implored him to give me some stuff i should n't know about @entity6			2
" @entity6 will be a loner as a leader : very thorough , but a loner			2
i 've got three assistants with me and , although people have suggested the players do n't need them , they must understand that the assistants are for me , not the players			0
" @entity7 will be seeking a fourth successive victory in @entity143 , with the @entity2 having last won the biennial event on home soil at @entity146 in 1999			1

@entity2 captain @entity1 *launches* an attack on @entity4 rival @entity6
@entity2 claims @entity7 's captain does not have the support of his players
the *duo* have had an *uneasy* relationship since @entity6 won 1987 @entity63
