-- in 2010 , @entity2 journalist @entity1 embarked on a mission to bring attention to her country 's lost and abandoned children			1
using the power of print , she started a newspaper column and more than four years later the award - winning writer has helped many youngsters reunite with their families and overcome a sense of hopelessness			1
while writing her " @entity20 " column for @entity17 , one of @entity2 's leading newspapers , @entity1 came into contact with several forgotten children , some of whom had been born into extreme poverty or suffered from abuse			1
through the success of her features , @entity1 was able to rapidly increase awareness of the ongoing plight faced by many local children			2
and yet she felt the need to do more			0
as a result , she started putting her contact details at the end of each article , encouraging readers to contact her and contribute what they could for many of these scared and neglected kids			2
" i really thank my readers because they always turn up , their response is always good , " says @entity1			2
" they come up and give assistance where some of these children have been taken to school because of their sponsorship			2
" a mother to many today @entity1 has become known as a mother to many of these motherless children -- and in turn she considers them her own			1
what 's most important to her however is that these children receive an education ; @entity1 often pays tuition fees for many of these kids out of her own pocket , in addition to the funds provided by some of her supportive readers			1
" i end up being the mother , " says @entity1 , who takes an active role in the kids ' lives by regularly checking their school reports to ensure that they 're on the right track			1
" they call me " mother , " they call me " grandy , " they call me all sorts of names and i end up feeling so bad that i do n't want to abandon them ... so i 've ended up paying school fees for many of them although i 'm getting very little money because as a freelance it 's really not the best thing			1
you have to struggle a lot			0
" tough childhood the journalist 's compassion stems primarily from her childhood ; she was born into a family of 19 children and was raised by her grandfather after her father , who had two wives , abandoned the family for another woman			1
" while growing up with my grandfather , i learnt a lot of things from him , " recalls @entity1			2
" he was a reverend , a born again and he loved to help needy people			0
we used to have a lot of people in our home			0
we used to get visitors in the night , those ones who have failed to get transport , those ones who did n't have anywhere to sleep			0
we would always share food with them			0
" after her grandfather 's death however , @entity1 was forced to drop out of school in order to look after her siblings			1
to do so , she worked several jobs with the hopes of returning to school at a later stage			0
when her brother started working in @entity125 he offered to pay for her to take a course in journalism			0
but before he could fulfill his promise , @entity1 's brother died			2
nonetheless , @entity1 was determined to make a name for herself and enrolled herself in a course in @entity2			1
her luck changed when she began her career in journalism after being offered a job as a features writer at @entity17			0
later on , a chance meeting at a police station , where two families were fighting over an abandoned child , let her to begin writing her column and become the voice of the voiceless in @entity2			1
@entity1 , who hopes to start a foundation whereby she can raise more awareness and support for these children by providing them with shelter and education , says the horrors many of these kids have had to overcome only strengthens her resolve to work harder			1
" we have to come together ; we have to pull out our resources ; we have to give care ; we have to really work together to see that we help all these needy children we see around , " she says			0
" if we empower them this will maybe help us reduce that number of abandoned children			0
