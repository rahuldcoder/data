@entity0 , half of the country music duo @entity3 , said she was never asked to delay the band 's show at the @entity6 because of an approaching storm			1
she would have complied if asked , @entity0 said , according to testimony given during a taped deposition			1
seven people died and more than 40 were injured last year when a storm caused a stage at the state fair to collapse , shortly before @entity3 was to perform			1
several families of victims from the august incident have filed a lawsuit against the country band , contending it was negligent			2
@entity20 , general manager for a law firm that represents some of those victims , released clips of @entity0 ' deposition to the media monday			1
it was taped thursday in @entity27 , @entity28			2
" we 're invited to come into a place and play			0
it 's not our place , " @entity0 said			1
" i do n't feel it 's my responsibility , or my management 's responsibility , to evacuate the fans in the case of danger			0
do i care about their safety ? absolutely			0
" she said she was not asked to postpone show and would have complied if she had been approached			1
furthermore , @entity0 said she did not know whether @entity3 tour manager @entity44 prevented a delay or not , and was unaware of conversations that allegedly occurred about a possible postponement			1
in an affidavit from a lawsuit against one company , the fair 's executive director says she twice sent the show 's promoter to talk to @entity3 in an effort to delay the show			1
twice the answer came back -- we want to go on , according to the deposition by @entity60 , the executive director of the state fair , according to the court filing			0
but in a separate document contained in a state report on the incident , @entity3 's @entity44 said no one asked the band to delay its set			1
when asked why his firm chose to release the clips , @entity20 said : " in our opinion the deposition tells a different story than the one being portrayed by @entity0 ' attorneys			1
they ( @entity3 ) could have delayed the start of the concert or sought to cancel it			0
they had access to doppler radar and were aware of the storm approaching			0
in our opinion they ( @entity3 ) bear ultimate responsibility			0
" the firm is also considering releasing video of the deposition of @entity87 , the other half of the country music duo			0
@entity3 spokesman @entity90 responded : " we 're not sure what these lawyers think they 're accomplishing by leaking selectively edited portions of the transcripts , but we do n't think it 's fooling anyone -- and it sure is n't bringing any truth or clarity to last summer 's tragedy			0
" their self - serving assertions about what @entity3 knew or could have done are contradicted not only by @entity87 and @entity0 's complete testimony but also by the independent reports of the @entity107 and the investigators hired by the state , " he said in a statement			2
in february , the @entity111 @entity110 announced penalties totaling $ 80,800 following a worker safety investigation into the collapse			0
the largest fines -- totaling $ 63,000 for what the agency said were three violations -- were levied on @entity119 , which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair			2
metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the @entity128 fairgrounds on august 13 , 2011 , right before @entity3 was to perform .			2
