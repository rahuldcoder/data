-- if you 've ever wondered what happens when you mix a sentient gorilla with a helicopter , look no further ! this and many other questions are answered during the course of @entity9 's compelling and invigorating " @entity8			1
" and if you 're looking for a summer popcorn film that wo n't talk down to you , you 've found it			1
i went into the screening of " rise " with low expectations , and there were many reasons for my trepidation			1
" @entity28 " would be one of them ( " oh , no ! the bad apes have the crystal lasers ! " ) and pretty much every other misguided reboot or " intelligent animal " movie since the original " @entity26 " series ended in 1973 would be the others			0
thankfully , you do n't have to worry , as @entity30 's restart of the legendary franchise delivers on almost every front			1
to my surprise and delight , " @entity41 " is what had become a summer movie rarity : fun , engrossing and a way to escape the heat without being treated like a 10 - year - old boy			2
believe it or not , " rise " is also reasonably intelligent			2
well , as intelligent as is possible , given the subject matter			0
it is , after all , basically a popcorn flick			0
with several nods and winks to the previous franchise , " rise " clearly knows which side of its bread is buttered , and fan boys and girls will not be disappointed			1
references are made both verbally and visually to the original , but do n't worry if you 're not ( yet ) a fan of the classic			0
no prior knowledge is required			0
the film opens with @entity60 ( @entity61 ) working in a biotech lab at a company called @entity64 ( get it ? ) developing what he hopes is a cure for @entity67 's by experimenting on chimpanzees			1
you see , @entity60 's father ( @entity70 ) has the disease , and @entity60 's hellbent on curing him			2
as this is an " animals in a lab " movie , something is bound to go wrong			0
in this case , one of @entity60 's subjects , @entity80 , seemingly goes berserk , and @entity60 's project is shut down on the eve of its approval for human testing			2
not allowing himself to be constrained by anything as trite as rules or ethics , will not only takes his research home with him ( he adopts an infant chimp that has been exposed to the experimental drug ) , but he also begins treating his father @entity94 with the serum			0
here is where the film takes off , both emotionally and technologically			2
unlike the animatronics of old , the special effects of " rise " are astonishing			1
while the film ostensibly stars @entity61 , @entity104 , @entity105 and several other noted actors , the real star of the show is @entity107 , the digitally created chimp brought to life by @entity109 -- the company that sprang to prominence for its work on @entity114 's " @entity113 " trilogy -- and by actor @entity112			1
@entity112 ( @entity116 in " @entity113 " ) , who has become the go - to guy for performance capture roles , plays @entity107 from infancy to adulthood , growing from a vaguely @entity121 - like childhood into your everyday , sullen , teenaged hyper - intelligent ape and eventually into an adult			2
@entity107 is a complex character , a first - of - his - kind artificially created leap in evolution , and as such , has a lot on his mind , all of which @entity112 has to portray through movement and facial expressions			2
it 's an extraordinary achievement and is the heart of the film as with any " wild animal lives with human " story , things go off the rails			1
@entity60 's obnoxious and confrontational neighbor ( @entity142 , playing against type ) reacts badly to a young @entity107 trying to play with his daughter and later assaults an @entity67 's - addled @entity94 when the latter tries to drive the former 's car and damages it			1
@entity107 sees @entity94 as a member of his family and defends him , attacking the neighbor			0
( how @entity107 lived with humans for so long without someone calling the cops is one of a few serious suspensions of disbelief in which one must indulge			0
) animal control is called , and the second act begins with @entity107 incarcerated in what is supposedly a paradise for wayward simians , but as anyone who 's seen a movie knows , is basically a maximum - security prison for apes			1
here , @entity107 begins to suspect that not all humans are as kind as his " dad , " @entity60 , and that maybe it 's his job as a super-intelligent chimp to balance the scales a bit			2
the scenes in the chimp prison ( " @entity174 from @entity175 , " anyone ? ) are where our empathy with @entity107 and his fellow primates turns to full - on " get those guys ! " blood lust as the evil jailers -- played by a criminally under - used @entity183 and his less - than - humane son , played by " @entity185 's " @entity186 -- routinely abuse their charges , even selling some to gen - sys			1
no one likes to see animals abused -- especially ones with thumbs -- and it 's here that @entity107 begins his transformation into a chimp @entity197			0
the tension of " rise " increases so gradually through the film 's first hour - plus that before you notice it , you 're on the edge of your seat , virtually gagging for the the promised ape revolution			1
and when it comes , you wo n't be disappointed			0
here is where @entity109 's genius combines with @entity9 's direction , @entity211 's cinematography and @entity213 's score to deliver a rousing finale with @entity107 at the forefront			0
ireporter talks to @entity61 the original " @entity26 , " while clearly a sci - fi film , was also a thinly veiled 1960s - style allegory about civil rights and the rising threat of nuclear proliferation			1
much of that is lost here , although new " lessons " about the dangers of tampering with nature are reasonably constant			0
that film 's stunning revelation at its climax is one of the most famous scenes in movie history , and since we 've now been treated to a prequel ( and assuming this is the start of a new franchise ) , the filmmakers are going to have to work pretty hard to find an equally compelling ending to the next film , since we already know the " surprise			1
" here 's hoping they manage it			0
" @entity8 " is rated @entity241 , and despite how cute some younger children might think chimps are , this is not the film for them			0
there 's far too much violence for the younger set .			0

@entity30 's restart of the legendary franchise delivers on almost every front
the tension of " rise " increases gradually through the film 's first hour - plus
unlike the animatronics of old , the special effects of " rise " are astonishing
