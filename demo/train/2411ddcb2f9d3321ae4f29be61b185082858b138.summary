-- @entity2 ' nonprofit , @entity1 , provides emotional and financial support to high school football players who 've sustained life - changing spinal cord injuries			1
@entity2 ' son @entity6 was paralyzed during a high school football game in 2001			1
but it was a year later when the two came up with the idea to help other kids and their families			2
@entity2 and @entity6 were watching a high school football game from the stands when they saw another player suffer a spinal cord injury			1
they reached out to the injured player and his family , and within months , @entity1 was born			1
@entity0 asked @entity2 for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity23 of 2011			1
@entity0 : where you were when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a top 10 @entity23 ? @entity2 : i was sitting at the dining room table , going over information about an event we hosted the weekend before			1
i was so excited ! i was listening to the other details , thinking to myself , " this is what @entity1 needs : creating awareness on a big picture			2
" @entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to @entity1 ? @entity2 : what a difference it could have to be able to help so many more high school football players all across the nation			1
... i was just pumping my fist , saying to myself : " yes ! yes ! yes ! " what a blessing			0
i had goose bumps going down my arms			0
i looked up and gave thanks to the @entity49 above			0
my eyes started to water , because i know my dad is looking down			0
and i said , " @entity54 , you were right ! " one of the last things my dad did was to bring me grant - writing information , telling me that i might need some of this information because @entity1 was going to be big and this would go nationwide			2
he went into the hospital that same day and passed a week later			0
i know he is smiling down on me			0
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity23 ? @entity2 : one of my goals has always been to create an educational fund for these guys , because some of them are getting of that age now where they want to go to school			1
the state requires you take a full ( class schedule ) to get funding ; a lot of them ca n't do that			0
( we want to ) get them back three semester hours , six semester hours -- whatever they think they can handle -- and let them go back to school			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity2 : @entity1 is not about deterring anyone from playing football			1
the game and the injury is the bond all these young athletes have			0
( but ) these kids need help , and the families need help			0
more attention should be given to what happens to the athlete after an injury has taken place			0
more attention should be given to the huge disparity in the level of support provided by the football community for those injured on a high school level compared to a collegiate or professional level			2
i am hoping that the football community can come together to make sure these young athletes are never forgotten			2
