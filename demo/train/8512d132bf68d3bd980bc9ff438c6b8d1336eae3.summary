-- like a fine @entity3 wine , it seems @entity4 just keeps getting better with age			1
at 34 , @entity4 is most certainly in the twilight of his long and illustrious career , which has seen him snare four @entity3 league titles , two @entity10 crowns and one @entity11			1
but in a tense round of 16 clash with fellow @entity3 @entity14 he proved he can still be the difference at the top level after his glorious free kick sent @entity18 into the @entity20 quarterfinals			1
locked at 1 - 1 after the first leg in @entity22 , @entity4 sent a perfectly flighted set piece into the net with less than 20 minutes remaining to seal a 2 - 1 aggregate victory			2
though a full 27 points separates the sides in @entity28 , with @entity18 poised to win their third straight @entity3 title , @entity14 are the only team to have beaten them in the league this campaign			1
but after the home side squandered several chances , @entity18 came back into the game , @entity4 's 71st minute goal coming shortly after @entity36 had been sent off for @entity14			1
now @entity18 have a real chance to banish the disappointment of going out of the @entity10 in the group stages by winning @entity41 's second - tier tournament			2
@entity43 giants @entity42 are also through to the last eight after they held firm in the face of a late fightback from @entity50 side @entity48			1
trailing 3 - 1 from the first leg in @entity52 last week , @entity48 then conceded the opener as @entity54 nodded home from close range			2
but @entity48 burst into life in the second half and after @entity59 scored twice in the space of two minutes , they needed just one more goal to level the tie and force extra time			2
but as they poured forward in search of their third goal of the night they were caught on the break , @entity64 scoring from the penalty spot after he was brought down in the area by @entity68			0
@entity48 manager @entity75 told @entity76 : " it 's such a shame we have n't gone through tonight			2
they were sweating near the end and the momentum was with us			0
" we thought if we stayed in the game we had the quality to hurt them			0
we wore them down , we countered time and time again with quality players			0
" elsewhere , @entity89 outfit @entity88 cruised into the quarterfinals after a 1 - 0 victory over @entity93 minnows @entity92 confirmed a 4 - 0 aggregate success			1
an early goal from @entity96 helped @entity97 , from @entity98 , to a 5 - 3 aggregate win over @entity100 , though the @entity102 side fought back to win 2 - 1 on the night			0
@entity104 side @entity103 held on in @entity105 for a 0 - 0 draw against @entity107 to secure a 1 - 0 win on aggregate			0
a 2 - 2 draw with @entity43 champions @entity110 was n't enough to see @entity3 side @entity112 into the last eight , as they lost 3 - 2 on aggregate			1
goals from @entity116 and @entity117 did the damage for @entity110 , who won the competition in 2011			0
@entity122 side @entity121 progressed to the next round despite having @entity124 sent off after just eight minutes and going behind to against @entity125 in @entity126			0
but they fought back in the second half and goals from @entity129 and @entity130 sent them through 2 - 1 on aggregate .			0

@entity3 champions @entity18 beat @entity14 to make @entity20 quarterfinals
*stunning* free kick from *veteran* @entity4 seals victory over fellow @entity3 side
@entity43 giants @entity42 see off late rally from @entity48 to make last eight
