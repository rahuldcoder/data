@entity165 said the official has now been identified as cabinet secretary @entity171 , and that he first contacted him in mid-june			0
" he said he was acting on behalf of the prime minster , " @entity165 said			0
" for about a period of a month , it was a cordial conversation			0
" but by @entity176 , @entity165 said , " it became an explicit threat of legal action if we did n't either return the disks or destroy them			0
" the @entity4 complied by destroying the hard drives			0
" the point , which i explained to the @entity18 officials , was that @entity3 , the @entity4 reporter , lives in @entity14 , " @entity165 told @entity1 's @entity183 , who was sitting in for @entity184			2
" he has a copy , and we already have another copy in @entity107			0
so destroying a copy in @entity0 was n't going to stop us from reporting			0
" deputy prime minister @entity192 , who heads the @entity193 , @entity167 's coalition partners , considered the authorities ' request " reasonable , " his office said			2
