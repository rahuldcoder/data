@entity0 , @entity1 -- a military - grade laser that blinds temporarily is the latest security technology available to wealthy superyacht owners afraid of pirate attacks			1
the @entity7 laser temporarily blinds pirates -- preventing them from attacking the yacht			1
the " @entity7 " laser , similar to weapons used for crowd control in @entity13 and @entity14 by the @entity16 military , has a range of four kilometers and becomes harder to look at the closer an attacker comes			1
at a distance of one kilometer , attackers develop strong nausea and can no longer see , according to @entity22 , the @entity23 company that developed the lasers for commercial use			1
" we do n't have guns , so we need non-lethal systems to defend yachts , " @entity27 ceo @entity26 told @entity28			2
@entity26 , who recently launched the $ 104,000 multi-colored laser at @entity33 , says the loss of eyesight the laser inflicts is only temporary and that no permanent damage is inflicted			0
hi - tech military - grade security systems like @entity7 have become increasingly popular with superyacht owners looking to protect multi-millon dollar yachts on the open seas			1
pirate attacks on oil tankers and other boats in dangerous waters like the @entity47 off the coast of @entity49 -- a maritime link between @entity51 and @entity52 -- have fueled the growing worry that superyachts may be the next target			2
because law regarding the use of deadly force on ships is ambiguous in some countries and the transport of guns is illegal in most international waters -- yacht crews favor the use of non-lethal weapons for security			0
this has fueled the recent market boom for weapons like @entity7 , according to @entity26			1
@entity7 is the latest of these kinds of weapons , which include " @entity73 , " a long - range acoustic device that temporarily deafens enemies and the $ 450,000 " @entity76 " tracking system , which combines radar and infrared or thermal cameras to detect incoming threats as far as five kilometers away			1
@entity81 , the world 's second largest global defense company , is thinking even bigger with plans for a sophisticated electronic early warning system for supertankers that some experts say could cost several million dollars			0
" piracy is on the rise , " said @entity88 of @entity81			2
" attacks in 2008 were double those of the previous year and there is a clear need for better methods to help commercial ships identify and evade pirates before an attack occurs			2
" the early warning system would use extremely advanced radars that could see over the horizon , as far as 25 km away			0
but pirates are not the only enemies of affluent yacht owners			1
for some , the paparazzi , using long range lens to take pictures of them on their yachts , can pose a privacy headache			0
according to reports in @entity114 newspaper , @entity113 , @entity111 billionaire @entity110 has installed an " anti-pap system " that would fire light beams at a camera , disrupting its ability to take images			0
aside from the anti-pap system , it has been widely reported that @entity123 's yacht " @entity124 " carries an anti-missile defense system and an escape submarine			0
the yacht is also said to have doubled in price to $ 1.2 billion since its commissioning three years ago			0
@entity130 , former super-yacht captain and technical editor at @entity132 , told @entity28 for a previous article : as a yacht owner , " you would be an absolute fool if you did n't have this sort of advanced defense technology .			0

lasers that blind pirates are now available to wealthy super-yacht owners
the lasers only temporarily impair eye - sight and make the assailant nauseous
systems such as @entity7 are on the increase with growing piracy figures
