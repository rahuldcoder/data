-- i grew up in @entity2 in wartime -- where the bombs were 7,691 miles away			2
my childhood was an @entity8 - @entity7 suburban dream punctuated by weekend sleepovers , saturday soccer games , fistfights with racist children of the @entity13 and religio - nationalist - driven demonstrations chanting " down with @entity16 ! " ; " @entity20 ! " ; " down with @entity18 ! " ; and " @entity19 ! " before i even knew what that meant			1
it is what i was fed growing up , in between southern - fried chicken and garlic mashed potatoes , cumin - scented meat and basmati rice			2
that 's why i 've referred to myself as " @entity8 by blood , redneck by the grace of @entity31			1
" watch @entity33 's @entity32 now as an artist in a world that is simultaneously in the process of globalizing and fracturing , the work i do explores what i have come to call the " geography of self , " a concept that revolves around a positioning of oneself in the world -- not just physically , but emotionally , mentally and , perhaps even for those who believe , spiritually			1
this position is ambiguous , temporary and very often debated			2
it is constructed by multiple voices and rendered through a prism of different , sometimes even contradictory , perspectives			0
the body of work i create combines traditional storylines and postmodern narrative strategies to approach themes such as belonging , identity politics and conflict , as well as the push towards -- and resistance against -- modernization			1
my work travels through mental and physical landscapes			1
it intentionally blurs and merges the lines between them , as well as those between fact and fiction , documentation and imagination			1
i looked into corruption in @entity19 through a work called " payback " and impersonated a police officer , set up a fake checkpoint on the street in @entity79 and stopped cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offered them money and apologized on behalf of the @entity85			1
i spent a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like pop - star bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich			1
and where else can the jihadi gangster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : " vote for me ! i 've done jihad , and i 'm rich			1
" @entity32 : what i saw in the war what i engage in through my art is , in fact , storytelling			1
but through these stories , there is a clear attempt to disrupt and reinterpret historical narratives , both real and imagined , in order to create an entirely new narrative that challenges the dominating histories ' stories that shape our experience and understanding of the world we live in			0
it 's not about activism , but about being engaged with our world and humanity in a way that goes beyond the superficial , instead looking deeper into historical constructions of our present state and the basic principles of human responsibility			0
art has often been and continues to be considered transcendent			0
i see this as misguided and , in fact , a way of subverting the powerful voice art can be in global discussions about politics , economics , society , culture , religion and international relations			2
@entity32 : my photographs bear witness this is not to say that i think my art provides answers			0
in fact , it may simply produce more questions			2
but in asking those questions , history and our role in how it constructs the present can be better understood			0
by using historical facts , documentation , oral history and imagination , i create forms of resistance against the imposition of certain historical interpretations upon us			2
it provides a way for us to rethink history , disturb identity , challenge authority , dissect politics , shake up society and understand ourselves			0
in the end , i hope we learn to question what we know of the past , what we understand of the present and what we can imagine for the future			0
perhaps this is too ambitious a project ; perhaps art should simply be aesthetically appealing and keep itself out of the realm of politics , history and self - awareness			0
perhaps this is too arrogant a philosophy , to think that what i have to say about the world and our role in it has any bearing at all on how others should think about their environment and themselves			0
@entity32 : dreams from endangered cultures perhaps this is too futile a goal and art is not enough of an action to be an actual catalyst for change			0
but this is the burden of creating this kind of work , a burden that perhaps comes from the dualistic life i have lived as an @entity7 citizen growing up in the comfort of suburbia while family members in @entity19 fought , died and , yes , killed in their battle against an invading army			1
knowing these opposing experiences could be simultaneously shared within the collective subconscious of my family drove me towards trying to better understand history , politics , perspectives and the human condition			0
this is my burden and so i must ask : " what 's yours ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity33 .			1

@entity33 , an @entity7 of @entity8 descent , is an artist who has worked in @entity79
he has *chosen* *provocative* themes , using humor to examine life in @entity19
his work intentionally blurs fact and fiction , reality and imagination
he *imitated* a " jihadi gangster " and did a *reverse* impersonation of a corrupt police officer
